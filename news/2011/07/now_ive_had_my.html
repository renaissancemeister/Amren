			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick McDermott, Daily Mail (London), July 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Nigerian woman who has cost the NHS up to £200,000 after flying into Britain while expecting quintuplets is to fight for the right to stay.</p>
<p>Bimbo Ayelabola, 33, who had been taking double doses of a fertility drug while in Africa, applied for a six-month visitor&rsquo;s visa within days of discovering she was pregnant.</p>
<p>As soon as it was granted, she travelled to the UK without her husband late last year on the pretence of visiting her three sisters.</p>
<p>An emergency NHS scan showed she was expecting four babies. </p>
<p>Owing to the size and complexity of the birth, she underwent a caesarean section 32 weeks into her pregnancy on April 28. </p>
<p>During the procedure at Homerton Hospital in East London, doctors discovered there was a fifth child. She gave birth to two boys, Tayseel and Samir, and three girls: Aqeelah, Binish and Zara. </p>
<p>Although she was due to leave last week, she believes the children are too frail to travel and has instructed lawyers to seek an extension to her visitor&rsquo;s visa.</p>
<p>The total bill to the taxpayer for Mrs Ayelabola&rsquo;s care alone is expected to reach £200,000, which she is unable to pay.</p>
<p>The five babies were all treated in a special care unit because they were born prematurely, at a cost of £1,000 a day for each of them. </p>
<p>Consequently, the cost of a week&rsquo;s hospital care for the family would be a staggering £35,000 for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>The issue has raised yet again the issue of so-called &#8216;health tourism&rsquo;  &mdash;  in which foreigners can use Britain&rsquo;s state-funded health system. It is estimated to cost the NHS £200million a year.</p>
<p>Foreign nationals should be charged for the full cost of any treatment they receive, with most hospitals employing overseas visitor managers whose job is to identify those who must pay. But urgent treatment such as maternity care will always be provided regardless of residence status or ability to pay.</p>
<p>Hospitals must then take reasonable measures to recover any debts from overseas patients. Many bills are never settled, however.</p>
<p>And border officials repeatedly report seeing passengers arriving in an advanced state of pregnancy after securing a visitor&rsquo;s visa. Around 150 cases a year are identified at Gatwick Airport.</p>
<p>Mrs Ayelabola, whose 37-year-old husband, Ohi, remains in Nigeria, has signed a five-figure deal with a red-top newspaper. </p>
<p>She said in an interview: &#8216;I had already had miscarriages and couldn&rsquo;t bear the stress another pregnancy would cause. So I decided to visit my family in London. I thought I would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now if I go back I&rsquo;ll be on my own without even a roof over my head. My entire family support network  &mdash;  three sisters, four aunts and virtually all my school friends  &mdash;  live here.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Mrs Ayelabola says she was unaware she was expecting as many as five children. The multiple birth is the likely result of the fertility drug Clomid, which she purchased over the counter in her home city of Lagos.</p>
<p>She began taking two pills a day  &mdash;  double the normal dose  &mdash;  and continued the regime for eight times longer than recommended.</p>
<p>Her children are being cared for with the help of her 26-year-old sister Stella, with whom she is living at a two-bedroom flat in Poplar, East London.</p>
<p>&#8216;The NHS is a national health service, not an international one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Ayelabola, who is not entitled to any state benefits and does not have the right to work, says she is struggling to pay for her family, with nappies and milk powder alone costing her £70 a week.</p>
<p>Despite being born in the UK, the children do not have an automatic right to British citizenship. To qualify, they would need at least one parent who is British, or who has indefinite leave to remain in the country. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the Home Office said: &#8216;The NHS is a national health service, not an international one. We expect those with no right to be in the UK to leave voluntarily otherwise we will seek to remove them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The UK Border Agency can deny someone entry into the country if they believe they are seeking free healthcare. But the rules are hard to enforce. In March, the Government announced plans to tackle health tourism. Measures include preventing anyone who owes the NHS more than £1,000 from entering the country until the debt is paid off.</p>
<p>Last night, from behind a closed door, Mrs Ayelabola said: &#8216;I am not happy about what has been written about me, that is not what I told them. You need to speak to my lawyer, I do not want to comment.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This is insane!!! Why must countries suffer third world invasion, pregnant women who use births in order to stay in countries who are stupid enough to burden taxpayers with their bills, people taken in from natural disasters who never leave, wet-foot, dry-foot people, lottery winners, and the list goes on. We pour money into these unfortunate places, but it&rsquo;s never enough for them. They take the money, then urge their people to break out laws. We have become a nation of unenforced laws and sounds like Great Britian is too.</p>
<p>P.S. Is &#8220;Bimbo&#8221; really her name?</p>

<p>Sweet music to my ears. Now lets really get into the spirit.<br>
&#8220;This is a nation, not an international flop house. We are<br>
British, we are white and Christian. You can leave voluntarily<br>

		<p>White western countries like the UK are experiencing a slow, agonising death. Now, many people believe in euthanasia so that a terminally ill person can be released from unnecessary suffering. I think the same should apply to nations. So let them all come! Let&rsquo;s send scores of empty Jumbo Jets over to Africa every week and fly thousands of Africans back, the sicker, dimmer, violenter, the better. Let them all come, and let&rsquo;s get the death of Britain over and done with once and for all, then we won&rsquo;t have to suffer these stories week in week out.</p>

<p>Looks like Bimbo will be able to contribute to the enormous hospital bill after all; (taking a deep inhalation) I&rsquo;m holding my breath for that one to happen. </p>
<p>I hope this cunning, opportunistic leech doesn&rsquo;t get to raise her black spawn in the UK, but my inner cynic thinks otherwise.<br>
We have to change our collective attitudes and harden up, because we Whites and the countries we&rsquo;ve built are becoming the doormats of the world. </p>
<p>What is likely to happen though is that the rules or laws get changed &#8216;equally&rsquo; for everybody because of the bad behaviour of &#8216;the few&rsquo;, but then judging by today&rsquo;s Cleveland Heights curfew story, even when you change the laws for everyone because of the few, you&rsquo;re still potentially a candidate for branding with the dreaded R-word (shudder). </p>
<p>So the again the lowest indicators in our societies get to define us all, but as our societies are now &#8216;global villages&rsquo; this means that the globes social peaks and troughs become all of our normal collective range of behaviour.</p>
<p>I wonder when exactly we in the West get to benefit from this exchange (beyond the few in business who sell us Westerner&rsquo;s out for cheaper wages or those who collect the taxes).</p>
<p>Sigh, when is the opportunity for locals to vote on their own National/State/local body issues every really going to be presented, if we can all vote on America (or local equivalent) idol or order movies etc. pay per view from our living rooms, how far away could daily political votes on such issues be?<br>
I suppose &ldquo;be careful what you wish for&rdquo;, he says as our countries continue to fill with stock genetically inclined for socialism.<br>
Can we just somehow start over again? While we traditionally minded still have a chance in defining our World (version 2.0).<br>

		<p>David Cameron&rsquo;s coalition government was elected on a promise to slash immigration and also has made a big play of slashing public spending (he has treated Britons suffering from disabilities ruthlessly and harshly).<br>
  If Cameron had any mettle at all, he would deport these horrible undesirables forthwith.</p>

		<p>Actually, Ms Ayelabola is not &#8216;entitled&rsquo; to a penny&rsquo;s worth of &#8216;free&rsquo; medical treatment from the NHS.<br>
 Believe it or not, since its foundation in 1948 foreigners not domiciled in Britain were never ever &#8216;entitled&rsquo; to free treatment - they are supposed to pay cash up front for their treatment and most of the big NHS hospitals have a cash office on the premises to deal with this situation.<br>

<p>Maybe she should have thought about that before popping double doses of fertility drugs. But why was she doing it in the first place??? The only reasonable conclusion is so that she could do exactly what she did.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m having a difficult time coming to terms with the above sentence. Notwithstanding the name, I&rsquo;ve never heard of a non-fertile black African woman! I suppose they exist (if we are to take the facts of this story as truth, they must), but one simply never thinks of this as a possibility. So I read on&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night, from behind a closed door, Mrs Ayelabola said: &lsquo;I am not happy about what has been written about me, that is not what I told them. You need to speak to my lawyer, I do not want to comment.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>So she&rsquo;s lawyered up as well. Do not lawyers in the UK cost money, or is her legal help on the house as well? Bimbo is not displaying the attitude of someone who is planning on going home anytime soon, and certainly not the attitude of a proper guest, given the generosity extended to her thus far.</p>
<p>Some people never learn!</p>

		<p>I despair - we have almost an entire village of Africans that is here or will be here soon. And this is just one case! My country is brimming full with these people who contribute nothing and yet are first in the queue with their hands out. The plan is to destroy the United Kingdom and the constituent nations, particularly England.  We are approaching the point of no return where we will become a balkanised state where to be English will be an oddity. </p>

		<p>I am a Nigerian, and I want to add that this woman had told a story full of lies. She does not deserve any form of support or help  from this nation. She is a disgrace even to those children. She should pack her bags and kids and go back to whereever she came from. </p>
<p>She master planned it all to deceive this nation and exploit the system. I am even sure, she  have had some form of fetility treatment and just  the drug. She should go and stop disgracing NIGERIANS .</p>
<p>If the  home office does allow her to stay, then they should be ready for more of these and stop deporting people. The woman bleach her visa, use deception, have been dishonest enough about her husband, family here and so on. She is lying, can you get this. Ask for DLA test for those family members. Investigate how they manage to stay here as well. They are all cheat! They want more from tax payers! We don&rsquo;t want more cheats! Fruad star! </p>
