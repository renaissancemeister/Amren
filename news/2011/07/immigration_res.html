			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed West, Telegraph (London), July 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Away from the main stage and today&rsquo;s headline act, Maurice Glasman&rsquo;s comments about immigration seemed to have done great damage to &#8220;Blue Labour&#8221;.</p>
<p>On Monday the Labour peer and academic told the Daily Telegraph that &#8220;Britain is not an outpost of the UN. We have to put the people in this country first&#8221;, and when asked by the Telegraph&rsquo;s Mary Riddell whether he would support a temporary ban on immigration, replied: &#8220;Yes. I would add that we should be more generous and friendly in receiving those [few] who are needed. To be more generous, we have to draw the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as any Labour people have commented on this, there has been universal condemnation. Anthony Painter called it &#8220;toxic&#8221;, writing in the Guardian:</p>
<blockquote>In Blue Labour&rsquo;s economic cosmology, immigration is the root of economic misery. Our economic advantage is not based on having world-class universities attractive to some of the best global minds. London and our other successful cities don&rsquo;t need to attract the very best global talent. We don&rsquo;t need to be in the EU to remain a location for global economic partnerships and inward investment. Our public services don&rsquo;t need any highly qualified staff who aren&rsquo;t British. And the economic drive of many migrants with an enormous range of skills can&rsquo;t serve any purpose in an ageing society. There are a set number of jobs to go around, of course.</blockquote>
<p>In the New Statesman Dan Hodges reports that:</p>
<blockquote>Blue Labour, the informal Labour policy group established by Ed Miliband advisor Maurice Glasman, is to be effectively disbanded.
<p>Labour MP Jon Cruddas and Middlesex University academic Jonathan Rutherford have both informed Lord Glasman they no longer wish to be associated with the project following an interview given by the controversial peer in which he expressed a belief that immigration to the UK should be completely halted.</p>
<p>A third influential supporter, Dr Marc Stears, is said by friends to be &#8220;deeply distressed&#8221; by Glasman&rsquo;s comments, and is also considering his future engagement with Blue Labour.</blockquote></p>
<p>Lord Glasman has since apologised for overstepping the mark in an email to Hodges, but it&rsquo;s curious that, even if they were not prepared to go as far as him, not a single Labour figure as yet can be found to even criticise their party&rsquo;s attachment to mass immigration. Yet, as I (and many others) have pointed out, mass immigration harms Labour&rsquo;s traditional supporters the most. Note that Glasman is not hostile to elite migration, an altogether different thing; when Painter talks about &#8220;world-class universities&#8221; and &#8220;highly-qualified staff&#8221;, does he not realise that Britain exports more graduates than it imports, with an overall loss of roughly 200,000 people? That over 50 per cent of migrants from some countries are economically inactive? Look around any London area outside that rich blue area left of the City and you can see quite clearly that most immigrants are not members of this imagined world brains trust. The economic arguments for mass immigration are very thin.</p>
<p>Neither, as Painter claims, are immigration restrictions toxic. In the US attitudes towards foreigners have improved and deteriorated with immigration levels, showing upwardly positive views throughout the long pause from 1924 and 1965. In the UK race relations improved throughout the 1980s and 1990s as immigration restrictions took effect; they worsened under New Labour. Of course positive internal measures also have an impact, especially a society-wide effort to make racism unacceptable, but numbers make a crucial difference. Those two efforts  &mdash;  restricting immigration and delegitimising racism  &mdash;  are not contradictory.</p>
<p>Yet at some point in the 1980s the Labour Party became convinced that any opposition to increased diversity was itself a racist idea. Diversity became its new Clause 4  &mdash;  a social good in itself. Yet most, or at the very least a very large minority, of Labour voters are unconvinced, and have seen the downsides of mass immigration in their neighbourhoods  &mdash;  both economically and socially.</p>
<p>For those Labour supporters unfettered globalism, where people can be shipped around as easily as computer parts, seems more like a Marxist parody of capitalist cruelty than the ideology of &#8220;progressives&#8221;. But because their traditional champions have embraced wholly the millennial idea of universalism and unrestricted altruism, they find themselves like pond-dwelling fish drowning in a large and cruel sea.</p>
<p>Jon Cruddas once said he was a &#8220;true&#8221; conservative in that he wished to conserve communities thrown apart by housing costs and shrinking social housing sector. That is a reasonable and decent aspiration, of course, but it&rsquo;s not compatible with the sort of diverse society we are becoming. Neither does that sort of society have much place for the sort of egalitarian, liberal policies which the Labour party believes in.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the future of British politics can be seen in a Guardian piece today, &#8220;Stop patronising poor Americans&#8221;, in which a US Democrat laments that poor people vote Republican against their economic interests. It&rsquo;s an old refrain, heard often. Yet the article does not mention a crucial factor: poor whites vote Republican because in the most racially-mixed areas of the US people vote along fairly strongly-marked racial lines. In Mississippi, the most African-American state, over 80 per cent of whites vote Republican  &mdash;  and most aren&rsquo;t rich by any means.</p>
<p>Labour people hate discussing this issue  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s just so distasteful, and besides which it won&rsquo;t happen here because England, is, you know, progressive and we have the BBC rather than Fox News. And yet this pattern has occured everywhere. How many working-class Ulster Protestants vote for the SDLP rather than for the less redistributionist Unionist parties? How many poor Lebanese Christians vote for Hezbollah? Who knows, maybe the grandchildren of Yorkshire miners will all vote Tory. Diverse societies are not fertile ground for progressive politics  &mdash;  so why is Labour horrified by the one policy, immigration restrictions, that gives the European Left any sort of a future?</p>

<p>My computer genius brother in law and dozens of his friends are part of those 200,000.  He graduated from Churchill College Cambridge in 1973 with a computer progamming degree.  Churchill was set up after World War 2 to be an English version of MIT.  The students had to meet the highest standards to be admitted. The very best teachers were brought in.</p>
<p>Back in 1973 neither my brother in law nor most of Churchill&rsquo;s grads were able to get computer programming jobs in England because even then English employeers preferred Indians, Arabs, Iranians, anything but the indigenious English.</p>
<p>He got a job in Italy and soon became the head systems designer for Alitalia, the national airline.  5 years later after he had supervised the entire computer system for this major airline he thought he would be able to get a job in England.  He applied for more than 100 jobs.  Nothing doing.</p>
<p>He and some of his genius IQ friends moved to the US and formed their own company and did very well.</p>
<p>My brother in laws career shows how far the English government goes to discriminate against the English.  They are throwing away the best and brightest English technocrats in favor of third worlders with dubious credentials.</p>
<p>Remember a few years ago the story about the medical residencies?  33,000 native English medical school graduates could not find residencies because the residencies were filled with non White foreigners.  When the students protested the medical association told them to do volunteer work in Africa for no money.</p>
<p>How would they support themselves for 4 or 5 years on volunteer work they asked the medical association.  Your families of course was the answer.</p>
<p>England is as bad as America.  Both countries are literally throwing away the best and the brightest.  I have always thought the whole affirmative action thing was cooked up in Moscow in the 1950&rsquo;s.  The Russians thought they had a chance to win  the Cold War.  Affirmative Action would be the perfect way to subvert a country from within.  Employing the unqualified instead of the qualified will destroy any institution.  </p>

In other words, people who have never had to break as much as one drop of sweat while working for a living.</p>

<p>Totally agree. Fox is Liberal-Lite and only fools think otherwise. As James Edwards says, they dilute the swamp water by one hundredth and everyone claims its Perrier. Fox is almost worse than the Liberal networks because it deludes people into thinking they are getting a legitimate alternative viewpoint. (Hint: They run entire segments on &#8220;youth mobs&#8221; and never mention race once!) Fox is like quack medicine, you hope it will work but in the end its just water and bit of whiskey inside.</p>

Exactly. Just like the ruling elite here in America that push diversity, open borders, amnesty, affirmative action and tolerance, all the while living in their white, gated communities and sending their kids to private school. The effects of their liberal policies don&rsquo;t touch them in any way, in any part of their lives.</p>
<p>What I can never understand is their shortsightedness. If they keep up with massive immigration, do they really think they will be the ruling elite of anything when they are outnumbered 5 to 1 by foreigners in a few generations?</p>

<p>You are so right about Fox. I haven&rsquo;t watched it in 3 years now and got to the point of hating to even look at O&rsquo;Reilly (he really is a blowhard) Hannity, etc. let alone hear their voices! </p>
<p>I used to listen to these &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show hosts also. Levin, Beck,  Rush, Hannity, and our local hosts. I still listen once in awhile  just to see what they are spouting and waiting for them to talk about all the racial crime (black on White) we have in America, yet nary a word. They HATE to tell racial truths, thereby lulling their White audiences back to sleep in ignorance. But knowing who owns our media for the most part and their paychecks, they will never cross their multicult bosses.</p>

<p>Much of the success of creative ventures due to talented people working together because they like each other&rsquo;s informal companionship. </p>
<p>Every day I see people associating in groups, and they usually stick to their own race. Simply throwing a lot of migrant Indians and East Asians into white London isn&rsquo;t going to bring about a synergy of creative cooperation; rather the racial groups will remain a collection of solitudes.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know why they call themselves the &#8216;Labour&rsquo; Party anymore.<br>
 They DO NOT represent the struggle of the working classes - in fact they are the biggest political enemy of the working man due to their policy of destroying wages and upping rents by uncontrolled, unrestricted massive third world immigration.<br>
 Why can&rsquo;t they be honest about it and call themselves the &#8216;Immigration Party&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>Discrimination by various methods against native-born people in English speaking countries is the norm. It is so rife in the United States that it probably falls not only on whites, but probably even on blacks, Asians and Mexican Hispanics.</p>
<p>If you insist on bringing in the &#8220;brightest&#8221; from around the world, make them leave when their work is done. If that is a privation, compensate them for their suffering. You don&rsquo;t need to make them part of your permanent population. In the meantime, get serious about developing the people you have. </p>

		<p>Kenelm Digby - absolutely right, just like the Democratic Party here is not the party of the working class, it is the party of the entitlement class.  Labour knows perfectly well that if you import a bunch of genetically challenged, angry, collectivist immigrants, you&rsquo;re going to create a hereditary entitlement-eating voting block.  The Democrats followed that strategy and it worked.  The blacks here vote 95% Democrat, every time, regardless of who is running, what&rsquo;s the issue, or anything, because they know they need entitlements to not starve, and they know the Democrats will keep them flowing.  </p>

<p>The reason that FOX News, conservative commentators, and the Republican party are so useless where race realism is concerned is because they are really working for corporate interests, not cultural issues.  They manipulate with Christianity and issues around that, but have no real interest in anything else.  </p>
<p>The poster who remarked about money is spot on.  Nothing changes; money talks, all else walks.</p>

		<p>This author has many good points, but this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two efforts &mdash; restricting immigration and delegitimising racism &mdash; are not contradictory.&#8221; oversimplifies things. </p>
<p>Mass immigration certainly does harm ethnic/racial relations in a serious way, bringing to fore &#8220;racism&#8221; in the general sense but actually creating genuine racial hatred. It is not the first but the second of those concepts which is the channel through which the &#8220;rivers of blood&#8221; end up flowing. </p>
<p>Trying to delegitimize &#8220;racism&#8221; through denying to whites a racial consciousness does not erase &#8220;racism&#8221; but merely holds the lid on a pot until it boils over. </p>
<p>Even in the absence of mass immigration, however, there is no guarantee race relations would improve when one group is able to reap enormous benefits at the expense of the other (unequal use of welfare, affirmative action, etc.). The antagonism remains, even if the exploited majority is not at risk of being replaced. And disproportionate birthrates between the races has a similar effect to immigration. I think almost all those parts are in effect in the UK. </p>
<p>Still, if Labour is interested in improving race relations (and maybe win elections?), stopping mass immigration is a good place to start. </p>

		<p>Either party, Democrat, Republican are completely ignorant or  just intentionally remain unconcerned about the massive expenditures for pandering to the illegal alien invasion. The federal debt ceiling and all 50 States have huge deficits from the illegal immigration occupation. Schools, health care and programs that is reducing America to a pauper nation. You as the American people must start yelling at the politicians in Washington, to demand they recognize that this issue is part of the discretionary spending. Only Rep. Michele Bachmann R-MN) Leader of the Tea Party Caucus, speaks out about this issue, with a conviction that this is part of our national issues. Bombard them with you voices, tell them no Amnesty, No Immigration Reform, no Sanctuary cities or States and No Dream Acts.</p>
<p> This needs to be repeated that When (Fair) analyzed the cost of illegal immigration and its nationwide deficit, they came up with a stunning figure of $113 billion dollars annually, while illegal alien revenue to the government coffers was a total amount of $13Billion dollars and change. Not included in these illegal foreign labors is wages leaving the country to foreign nations, estimated to be 46 Billion dollars? Our economy is sinking and the Obama administration is insisting on passage of another Amnesty failure. Heritage Foundation has stated that cost for processing another Amnesty expenditure is another 2.5 Trillion dollars,</p>

		<p>Labour and it&rsquo;s supporters have no interest in restricting immigration. They have opened the floodgates so wide that we rapidly feel like we are losing our own country. </p>
<p>Whilst maps in the left-leaning-rag &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; show that most of the country is still 80+% White, the useful idiots and those in the comment sections (who long for a &#8220;khaki&#8221; future race and denounce the &#8220;racists&#8221; who &#8220;cannot argue with the facts&#8221;) fail to realise the rate and pace of growth that has occurred and the relative age structures.</p>
<p>Over 35% of new borns are now non-white British in England and Wales. 20%+ of people living here are foreigners/foreign extraction. Large areas of the country are unrecognisable as being British at all - and it seems that no matter where you go you are in the presence of these people. </p>
<p>Labour and Conservatives like to play this game where they announce these revelations on how they should have &#8220;restricted immigration&#8221; and  &#8220;listened to the voters&#8221; - but they do not give a damn! They are conniving liars and cannot be trusted for a second. </p>
<p>The Conservatives have continued to let them all come in - despite promises to the electorate that they would &#8220;reduce the numbers from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands&#8221; (a common catch phrase in the media) and it actually surpassed the last year that Labour was in charge! Not only that, but they desire Turkey to enter the European Union at the same time as seeking to restrict immigration! They are two faced opportunists.</p>
<p>Then - just for the sheer unbelievably imbecilic hell of it - Labour politicians had the sheer bloody nerve to criticise the Conservative party over their immigration record!  Hello?!! McFly!!! Is anybody home McFly?!!! Labour should be done for genocide/crimes against humanity and they criticise the Conservatives for a &#8216;immigration shambles&rsquo;?   </p>
<p>Conservatives are probably just treading water whilst they hive off control to European Border Agency staff of some description or another - so they can say &#8220;it is not us! We are doing all we can!&#8221;.  Labour made sure the UK Border Agency was unfit for purpose, the Tories will probably kick it to the kerb. </p>
<p>Now they are out of office, Labour will say anything they like to try and wrestle back some votes. They have stabbed us in the heart and then have the cheek to ask us to fill in organ donation cards for the rest of our body to be sold off and given away to others before we snuff it! </p>
<p>Do not trust this man Glasman. Do not trust any Labour spokesman or representative. There is not one single bone in their bodies that cares for white European people and the true British nation. All they are interested in is sounding good, sounding tough, and trying to keep a lid on society. </p>
<p>They are at their core a Marxist, Communist, Communitarianist organisation hell bent on radical transformation of the world. </p>
<p>The rebuttals to this one man speaking out about mass-immigration being stopped speak volumes about the wider party and what would happen if (no doubt when) they get back into office. </p>
<p>Any white Briton who votes for Labour, Liberal Democrats or Labour are lobotomised drones who are that detached from what is good for our survival that it is hard for the rest of us to comprehend. </p>
<p>There is more chance of me doing backflips around the moon than there is of any of the main parties halting immigration and reversing it&rsquo;s effects. </p>
<p>I am sure the pro-multiculturalists, pro-diversity and pro immigration people are not going to be quaking in their boots any time soon. </p>
