<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>California&rsquo;s budget crisis has reduced the University of California to near-penury, claim its spokesmen. &#8220;Our campuses and the UC Office of the President already have cut to the bone,&#8221; the university system&rsquo;s vice president for budget and capital resources warned earlier this month, in advance of this week&rsquo;s meeting of the university&rsquo;s regents. Well, not exactly to the bone. Even as UC campuses jettison entire degree programs and lose faculty to competing universities, one fiefdom has remained virtually sacrosanct: the diversity machine.</p>
<p>Not only have diversity sinecures been protected from budget cuts, their numbers are actually growing. The University of California at San Diego, for example, is creating a new full-time &#8220;vice chancellor for equity, diversity, and inclusion.&#8221; This position would augment UC San Diego&rsquo;s already massive diversity apparatus, which includes the Chancellor&rsquo;s Diversity Office, the associate vice chancellor for faculty equity, the assistant vice chancellor for diversity, the faculty equity advisors, the graduate diversity coordinators, the staff diversity liaison, the undergraduate student diversity liaison, the graduate student diversity liaison, the chief diversity officer, the director of development for diversity initiatives, the Office of Academic Diversity and Equal Opportunity, the Committee on Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Issues, the Committee on the Status of Women, the Campus Council on Climate, Culture and Inclusion, the Diversity Council, and the directors of the Cross-Cultural Center, the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource Center, and the Women&rsquo;s Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} UC Berkeley&rsquo;s own vice chancellor for equity and inclusion shows how voracious a diversity apparatchik&rsquo;s appetite for power can be. Gibor Basri has 17 people working for him in his immediate office, including a &#8220;chief of staff,&#8221; two &#8220;project/policy analysts,&#8221; and a &#8220;director of special projects.&#8221; The funding propping up Basri&rsquo;s vast office could support many an English or history professor. According to state databases, Basri&rsquo;s base pay in 2009 was $194,000, which does not include a variety of possible add-ons, including summer salary and administrative stipends. By comparison, the official salary for assistant professors at UC starts at around $53,000. Add to Basri&rsquo;s salary those of his minions, and you&rsquo;re looking at more than $1 million a year.</p>
<p>UC San Diego is adding diversity fat even as it snuffs out substantive academic programs. In March, the Academic Senate decided that the school would no longer offer a master&rsquo;s degree in electrical and computer engineering; it also eliminated a master&rsquo;s program in comparative literature and courses in French, German, Spanish, and English literature. At the same time, the body mandated a new campus-wide diversity requirement for graduation. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The salary and expense account of the likely new director of the UC Berkeley Initiative for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, John Powell  &mdash;  who is currently the executive director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University&rsquo;s law school  &mdash;  will likely dwarf anything seen so far among diversocrats, according to inside sources.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This week, in light of a possible cut of $650 million in state financing, the University of California&rsquo;s regents will likely raise tuition rates to $12,192. Though tuition at UC will remain a bargain compared with what you would pay at private colleges, the regents won&rsquo;t be meeting their responsibility to California&rsquo;s taxpayers if they pass over in silence the useless diversity infrastructure that sucks money away from the university&rsquo;s real function: teaching students about the world outside their own limited selves. California&rsquo;s budget crisis could have had a silver lining if it had resulted in the dismantling of that infrastructure  &mdash;  but the power of the diversity complex makes such an outcome unthinkable.</p>

		<p>Just more proof that the university system has no intention of actually educating the youth with knowledge.  They are indoctrinating students with cultural Marxism.  They will dumb down society as much as possible so long as it promotes &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.  A meaningless term.  They are fanatical about the empty platitude of &#8216;Diversity Uber Alles&rsquo;.  There&rsquo;s absolutely zero evidence to support the slogan &#8216;Diversity is Strength&rsquo; but they don&rsquo;t care.  They cover up all the history and current media stories that prove just the opposite.  Diversity is weakness.  And I&rsquo;d really like to know what the heck these university administrators actually do.  Probably just flick rubber bands.  </p>

Gibor Will Close the Achievement Gap* (for the bargain price of only $200K/yr plus full a full benefits package)</p>
<p>*Well, not really. Gibor explains that: &hellip;the job facing the VCEI &#8220;is huge; it&rsquo;s not like one person could do it. So my role is not to do it.&#8221; Rather the work is to &#8220;coordinate&#8221; and streamline wide-ranging campus efforts on equity and inclusion, he says. &#8220;It&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s responsibility to deal with these issues.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Universities&rsquo; enormous diversity infrastructures, particularly at elite universities, have their hands full creating sufficient supplementary services and support and specially-tailored course offerings   &mdash;  - to accommodate the stark differences in cognitive abilities of the student body.</p>
<p> Excerpts from &#8220;How Diversity Punishes Asians, Poor Whites and Lots of Others&#8221;<br>
By Russell K. Nieli, MindingtheCampus.com, July 12, 2010:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A new study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and his colleague Alexandria Radford is a real eye-opener in revealing just what sorts of students highly competitive colleges want   &mdash;   or don&rsquo;t want   &mdash;   on their campuses and how they structure their admissions policies to get the kind of &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; they seek. The Espenshade/Radford study draws from a new data set, the National Study of College Experience (NSCE), which was gathered from eight highly competitive public and private colleges and universities (entering freshmen SAT scores: 1360).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Race has a profound effect on one&rsquo;s chances of admission, all other things being equal:</p>
<p>&#8220;The box students checked off on the racial question on their application was thus shown to have an extraordinary effect on a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the highly competitive private schools in the NSCE database. To have the same chances of gaining admission as a black student with an SAT score of 1100, an Hispanic student otherwise equally matched in background characteristics would have to have a 1230, a white student a 1410, and an Asian student a 1550.&#8221;</p>
<p>The depth of the discrimination against lower-class whites is particularly shocking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.  These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed. Their diversity-enhancement value was obviously rated very low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do elite universities have a profound bias against lower-income whites, all other things equal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;since they [universities] have a limited amount of money to give out for scholarship aid, they reserve this money to lure those who can be counted in their enrollment statistics as diversity-enhancing &lsquo;racial minorities.&rsquo; Poor whites are apparently given little weight as enhancers of campus diversity, while poor non-whites count twice in the diversity tally, once as racial minorities and a second time as socio-economically deprived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ugly truth is that most colleges, especially the more competitive private ones, are fiercely concerned with their ratings by rating organizations like U.S. News &amp; World Report. And an important part of those ratings consist of a numerical acceptance rate (the ratio of applicants received to those accepted) and a yield score (the ratio of those accepted to those who enroll). The lower the acceptance rate and the higher the yield score the more favorably colleges are looked upon. In extending admissions to well-qualified but financially strapped whites who are unlikely to enroll, a college would be driving both its acceptance rate and its yield score in the wrong direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s new is the discovery of heavy bias against applicants who have had leadership roles in 4H clubs, Future Farmers of America and ROTC:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;what Espenshade and Radford found in regard to what they call &#8220;career-oriented activities&#8221; was truly shocking even to this hardened veteran of the campus ideological and cultural wars. Participation in such Red State activities as high school ROTC, 4-H clubs, or the Future Farmers of America was found to reduce very substantially a student&rsquo;s chances of gaining admission to the competitive private colleges in the NSCE database on an all-other-things-considered basis. The admissions disadvantage was greatest for those in leadership positions in these activities or those winning honors and awards. &#8220;Being an officer or winning awards&#8221; for such career-oriented activities as junior ROTC, 4-H, or Future Farmers of America, say Espenshade and Radford, &lsquo;has a significantly negative association with admission outcomes at highly selective institutions.&rsquo; Excelling in these activities &lsquo;is associated with 60 or 65 percent lower odds of admission.&rsquo;&#8221; </p>

		<p><i>the regents won&rsquo;t be meeting their responsibility to California&rsquo;s taxpayers</i> </p>
<p>The UC regents and jerks in the statehouse have already betrayed the taxpayers of California:</p>
<p><i>California law allows illegal immigrants who qualify for admission to a four-year state university to pay in-state tuition rather than the more expensive out-of-state tuition rate.</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Qualify for Admission&#8221; means illegal immigrants given preference for admission over the Native Born White Children of California   &mdash;   those whose parents heavily subsidize California&rsquo;s UCs via satanic state taxes   &mdash;   despite the &#8220;constraints&#8221; of Prop 209.</p>
<p><i>California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law today a bill allowing illegal immigrants to receive privately funded scholarships to attend the state&rsquo;s public colleges and universities.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8216;At the end of the day, if we&rsquo;re going to continue as a powerful, equal-opportunity society, we&rsquo;re going to have to invest in our people!&rsquo; Brown, a Democrat, said at the signing ceremony in the library of a Los Angeles community college.</i></p>
<p>Yes!  Investing in those with IQs of 90 over those with IQs of 130+ is certainly a fine way to build a &#8220;powerful, equal-opportunity society!! </p>
<p>Looks to me as if it&rsquo;s a blatant effort to keep Whites down rather than &#8220;lift up&#8221; those who are doomed to fail at the university level.</p>
<p><i>A separate bill under consideration in the legislature would allow illegal immigrants to qualify for publicly funded scholarships as well.</i></p>
<p>You can believe that this will pass soon as well, along with driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>After all, illegal immigrants have more rights in California than Native Born White Americans.</p>

		<p>It will be interesting to see what transpires as the economy continues to worsen and funding for this radical leftist institution is harder to come by.</p>
<p>Diversity to these people is a cult with every bit the same mindless allegiance its adherents give to it as those programmed into the kookiest sects.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how their diversity machine will survive when confronted with the prospect of complete dissolution or drastic cut backs to basic levels.</p>
<p>But the fools are so radical they just might fool us all and go down with the ship.  After all, as Michael Savage and some high profile psychiatrists tell us, liberalism is a mental disorder.</p>

		<p>UCSD once was a star of the UC system, especially in the MSE subjects. Its faculty included science Nobelists. Yet I read they have now dropped the Master&rsquo;s offering in a field so crucial to our future as electrical-and-computer engineering. I cannot express my dismay at this turn of events. And even the flagship school, UC Berkeley, is getting the diversity works. SHAME!</p>

		<p>This same type of diversity fraud is being committed in Illinois. The state legislature has coddled illegals and offered them &#8220;in state&#8221; tuition rates. The DREAM Act is being enacted on an Illinois basis despite the fact that the same proposal has been rejected nationally. The traitorous US Senator Richard &#8220;Turban&#8221; Durbin has been pushing for these types of laws. </p>
<p>By the way, what do California and Illinois both have in common?<br>
Both are virtually bankrupt as a result of their politics being dominated by liberal lunatic legislators.</p>

		<p>The only &#8220;equality&#8221; there should be is the equality of opportunity. Which there already is. Everything other than that is a way for the liberal elites to redistribute wealth from  the white upper middle class to a mostly lazy and unmotivated poor class. Because if you look closely at who is most affected by these policies it&rsquo;s not the rich elite which is made up mostly of Jews who coincidentally make up the majority of those who make these policies, but it&rsquo;s the white middle and upper middle classes.</p>

<p>Any time AmRen runs an article about some nonsensical diversity program or &#8220;Black Studies&#8221;, several commenters will say something along the lines of, &#8220;As college budgets get cut, there simply won&rsquo;t be the money for these non-core subjects, our universities will start eliminating all this extraneous PC nonsense catering to minorities&hellip;&#8221; etc. </p>
<p>And every time AR people write things like that, I think to myself, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t be so sure. My guess is schools will CONTINUE catering to minorities, regardless of budgetary considerations, even if it means killing off traditional studies. If something&rsquo;s gotta go, it&rsquo;s NOT going to be the PC basket-weaving courses.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I attended a UC school early in my traning. Even though it was the latter part of the 1970&rsquo;s, the UC-Berkeley hippy &#8216;feel&rsquo; was still on campus. Cold, impersonal architecture, academics that were so abstruse in their thought processes that cogent conversations were impossible, a defininte &#8216;ivory tower&rsquo; mentality, and the snobbiest kids I&rsquo;d ever seen. I transferred to a Cal. State University system campus before the quarter was out.</p>
<p>All of this &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is nothing less than mandated thought police tactics - it IS the &#8216;establishment of religion&rsquo; - the religion of sexual secularism, esp. in the realms of LGBT advocacy, in the wake of NY&rsquo;s heinous act recently.</p>
<p>All of these offices should be stripped of funding, their staff fired, and a moratorium on ANY such &#8216;diversity&rsquo; practices for sixty years, all in the name of &#8216;equal time&rsquo; to see which six-decade long era was more &#8216;beneficial&rsquo; to the USA.</p>
<p>Won&rsquo;t happen, of course. The most intolerant individual is the one that says they are &#8216;tolerant.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The REALLY bad thing about this is it is exactly what the voters voted to stop when they passed Prop 209 15 years ago. Prop. 209 went on to pass court muster after being challenged on constitutional grounds. Apparently university administrations are above the law.

		<p>The official diversity offices with diversity bureaucrats are about one thing most of all:</p>
<p>Displacing the US&rsquo;s historical racial majority.</p>
<p>They like to say it&rsquo;s not a zero sum game, but there&rsquo;s only a limited amount of money and a limited number of seats in the classroom.</p>
<p>A hispanic girl born in Mexico and in this country illegally going to a UC school means that your white son born in California can&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>These diversity offices are successfully doing their job when this happens.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that simple. Them or us.</p>

		<p>«&hellip;the Academic Senate decided that the school would no longer offer a master&rsquo;s degree in electrical and computer engineering; it also eliminated a master&rsquo;s program in comparative literature and courses in French, German, Spanish, and English literature.»</p>
<p>So this means that this university has eliminated a program that produced American engineers (more non-White foreigners, with foreign credentials, will be hired to work in the US, instead). And that same university, eliminated courses and programs, in some European languages.</p>
<p>Still, some people I know, tell me I am being paranoid, when I say that there are definitely anti-White forces at work, in the US.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really understand, why we aren&rsquo;t seeing violent, desperate acts of protest, from Whites who see their countries (the Us and others) being stolen from them. How much more injustice and humiliation can we take, before it hits the fan, as you say?</p>
