<h1>McDonald&rsquo;s Manager Accused of Punching Customer</h1>
					
					<p>WSBTV (Marietta), July 21, 2011</p>					
					
									
                
                	
	                	<p>An arrest warrant has been issued for the manager of a Marietta McDonald&rsquo;s after she punched a mother of two autistic boys in the face, Marietta police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The manager, Tiffany Denise Allen, told the woman that the twin boys&rsquo; service dog, Barkley, wasn&rsquo;t allowed inside, police said. Allen was off duty.</p>
<p>The law, however, states that the dog is allowed inside.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The family was about to leave when Allen told them there were no dogs allowed, police said.</p>
<p>Schwenker explained that Barkley is a service dog, allowed by federal law in all public places including restaurants. Schwenker offered to provide proof of the permit for the dog, Marietta police said.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough for Allen, they said. The tape shows her following the family around the McDonald&rsquo;s, even down the hall to the restroom.</p>
<p>When Schwenker tried to leave, she lost track of one of the boys. In a panic, she threw her drink on the floor and it splashed on Allen, police said.</p>
<p>The tape shows Allen running after Schwenker in a rage, police said. Marietta police Detective Gwen Lewis told Davis that she has never seen anything like it.</p>
