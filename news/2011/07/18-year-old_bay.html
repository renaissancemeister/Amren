		<p>He reportedly &#8220;expressed remorse&#8221;? I doubt this very much. He probably was expressing consternation at the possibility of getting caught, and others twisted what he said. The defense strategy is in play already.</p>

		<p>I was born and raised in Bayonne, N.J. ( builder of JFK&rsquo;s P.T. 109 ) Bayonne was a solid socks blue collar middle class White -Christian city being destroyed by the &#8221; effects of the ongoing genocidal/culturalcidal 1965 Immigration and Reform act; taxation without representation and diminishing since 1965 ). I am also a retired teacher of their public school system and painfully experienced the ethnic/ racial cleansing inflicted by our &#8221; racist non-representatives &#8221; in Congress ever since&rsquo; 65. Sadly this is not unique to Bayonne or N.J. and certainly happening at a much faster rate our border states with Mexico along our non-existent border . Only White -Christian countries  are supposed to pay for its own eradication or &#8220;Holocaust&#8221; to up-lift non-Whites to a higher socio-economic status at their own expense ! Non-Whites,like the Japanese; see the immorality &amp; impracticality of self-destruction; good for them, fatal for us !</p>
