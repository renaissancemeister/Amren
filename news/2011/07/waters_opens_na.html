<h1>Waters Opens NAACP Conference with Fiery Defense of Race-Conscious Politics</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Herndon, WAVE (Los Angeles), July 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rep. Maxine Waters delivered a blistering defense of race-conscious politics on Sunday, telling thousands of delegates to the NAACP&rsquo;s national convention that conservative politicians are actively working to roll back the voting rights of African-Americans ahead of the 2012 presidential election.</p>
<p>&#8220;With only 15 months left before the next presidential election, Republicans are rewriting voting laws to require photo identification at the polls, reduce the number of days of early voting and to enhance voting restrictions against ex-felons and out-of-state students,&#8221; Waters said, citing legislation signed into law by GOP governors in Texas, Wisconsin and Florida.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make no mistake: We have been down this road before with Jim Crow laws,&#8221; Waters added, calling the laws &#8220;21st century poll taxes and literacy tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drawing raucous applause, the firebrand congresswoman from Los Angeles, where the convention is being held this year, said, &#8220;NAACP, I recognize that you&rsquo;re non-partisan  &mdash;  but I&rsquo;m not. Sometimes &hellip; we simply cannot try to get along with everyone. We cannot &hellip; be worried that some people will say, &#8216;Oh, they&rsquo;re playing the race card.&rsquo; Those of us who are willing to step outside the box and fight for justice and equality must be prepared to take the criticism and make the sacrifice.&#8221;</p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;rewriting voting laws to require photo identification at the polls, reduce the number of days of early voting and to enhance voting restrictions against ex-felons and out-of-state students,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Why are these proposals viewed as racist? Because they&rsquo;re basic, common sense reforms; something Rep. Waters clearly lacks.</p>
<p>To respect the weight of my vote, I DEMAND proof of identity. Anyone with a legitimate right to vote has no fear of proving who they are.</p>
<p>Letting people vote on the same day as registering is unfair to the system and the workers. If you can&rsquo;t be bothered to register one to two weeks before voting, how much do you really care about voting?</p>
<p>Same day voting and registering is a recipe for abuse and fraud and they know it.<br>

		<p>And all this passes without a single breath of criticism from the controlled Imperial governmedia.  Can you imagine a pro-<i>White</i> conference featuring a &#8220;fiery defense&#8221; of <i>White</i> &#8220;race-conscious politics&#8221; getting off so lightly?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;NAACP, I recognize that you&rsquo;re non-partisan&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>How this brain-dead creature could possibly get away with describing an explicitly racial-advocacy organization as &#8220;non-partisan&#8221; is something that only the terminally liberal can understand. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Republicans are rewriting voting laws to require photo identification at the polls&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Only a problem for those who want to commit voting fraud, Maxine.  Sound like anyone you know?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;reduce the number of days of early voting&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Uh, yeah.  As the old joke has it, &#8220;vote early and vote often.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;and to enhance voting restrictions against ex-felons&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Read: black criminals.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;and out-of-state students.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Read: naive young knee-jerk liberals.  Take it from one who knows, if you live in the same county as pretty much any university, a vote for any but the most far-left liberal candidates is a vote wasted.</p>
<p>Blacks and liberals are well aware of all this, of course, which is why this article was <i>not</i> titled &#8220;Incompetent Black Woman Opens Black Racist Conference With Radical Racist Hate Rant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am eagerly awaiting equally sympathetic media coverage of the next American Renaissance conference.  But I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.<br>

		<p>Maxine Waters:  Native of East St. Louis, Illinois, and a graduate of Vashon High School in St. Louis.  Please accept my apologies.  Now, allow me to wear a paper bag over my head for awhile.</p>
<p>Her district goes Hispanic once she retires.</p>
<p>As far as photo ID for voting, St. Louis City might soon require those who sell scrap copper to present photo ID before being paid, and paid with a check in the mail not cash up front, to deter drug addicts from stealing copper.  Missouri requires photo ID to buy canned compressed air to clean out electronics.  In other words, every teenager and adult needs a photo ID to be functional.  The local radio hosts who has the two hours before Rush on the same station did a voter photo ID show, and his caller base is evenly split between left and right   &mdash;   He did a phone survey, and every one of his callers said they had photo ID and didn&rsquo;t know anyone at least 18 years old who didn&rsquo;t have one.</p>

		<p>The race card has become a punch line due to its overuse.  When parts of our society blame the part that pays for its own survival and that of its parasitic counterparts, the blame only goes so far.  </p>
<p>What else could possibly be done to make the parasitic society appeased?  Have the trillions in handouts and government-mandated preferential treatment not been enough?  </p>

		<p>Yeah this is the woman who called the LA riots in 1992 a &#8220;rebellion&#8221; and &#8220;understandable&#8221; . This is the woman who is on the Finance Service Commission but does not know the difference between federal funds rate and federal reserve discount rate. In June 2009 the Citizens Against Waste awarded her the Porker of the Month Award for earmarks for her Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center. United Bank, (was heavily invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) of which her husband is a stockholder, received 12 Million from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Hopefully she goes down for that one.</p>

<p>No doubt if those things increased the black vote Rep Waters would be all for them, and objecting to this, &#8216;racism&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I wonder what &#8216;WAVE los angeles&rsquo; would make of an elected official attending an AmRen conference (our group that is arguably less extreme and divisive)? That&rsquo;s a good idea because concerned citizens should be &#8216;willing to step outside the box and fight for justice and equality&rsquo; and &#8216;be prepared to take the criticism and make the sacrifice&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Ahh, this is so precious on so many levels! Can this &#8220;lady&#8221; give any more fodder for the right &amp; left? Make sacrificies for the betterment of the party? Good luck with that. There&rsquo;s not another group on this planet more &#8221; me first &#8221; than blacks. Unless you count rich White elitist types, no matter which political affiliation. Secondly by claiming that it&rsquo;s discriminatory to not allow a felon to vote is basically conceding that blacks are overwhelmingly effected by their rap sheets. She can claim that but I can&rsquo;t. And why is this? I&rsquo;m not tan enough, apparently. </p>

		<p> The NAACP non-partisan? Yeah   &mdash;   and the pope isn&rsquo;t Catholic.</p>
<p> Interesting that Waters should mention how voting laws are being &#8220;re-written,&#8221; as she put it, to restrict voting rights of ex-felons. Understandable, considering that many of her own constituents no doubt fit that description.</p>
<p> The voter ID card laws have been in force in Indiana for years. I&rsquo;ve worked the polls several times, and they haven&rsquo;t caused any problems that I&rsquo;m aware of. If you don&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s license, and you tell the people at the license branch that you need a state non-driver&rsquo;s ID card in order to vote, by law they can&rsquo;t charge you anything for it. So much for the bogus argument that such laws &#8220;discriminate against the poor and minorities.&#8221; They discriminate against people wishing to commit voter fraud.</p>

		<p>Maxine Waters, unfortunately, is from our area, and she has ALWAYS been a rabble-rouser.  She epitomizes the victicrat, entitlement mentality; she has made her career on promoting that, much like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.  The reason they get away with it is that their constituents are too dumb to see through their lies, and FAR too dumb to realize that THEY are financing these charlatans.  Waters, Jackson and Sharpton are all millionaires.  Gee, how&rsquo;d that happen?  They screwed their own people for the money, knowing the folks would never go after them for fraud or anything else.  The stupids think Waters et al are their champions while said champions are taking the people for every dime they can.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not against this type of oratory from blacks. It just brings that day a bit closer till they go stark raving mad and commit such atrocious acts that will force us to finally deal with them. I hope that when that day comes, we remember we&rsquo;re not like them and even though we&rsquo;ll have to be harsh with them, we must always remember not to be inhumane towards them. They can&rsquo;t help what they are.</p>

		<p>Photo ID is a simple method to assure the person voting is in deed who they say they are.  If they are not, then the risk is they may negate my legitimate vote.  The key is whether the requirement is onerous to the point of restricting ones ability to vote.  Photo IDs come in the form of driver&rsquo;s licenses and passports.  Many states issue driver&rsquo;s license and photo IDs to illegal immigrants.  The right to vote includes some responsibility to assure the system works.  There is some price to pay for a working democracy.  Unless, of course you have been taught to take without giving. The moral hazard of the government&rsquo;s social benefits programs. </p>

<p>I kind of had those thoughts reading &#8216;Dreams from my Father&rsquo;. There are a lot of social workers and activists who owe their cushy jobs and nice salaries to an arguable fleecing of the poor, or at least they are using up a good deal of the resources allocated &#8216;for the poor&rsquo;. </p>

<p>Although I detest this black supremist with all my being, I&rsquo;ve really got to hand it to her for standing by her convictions. What she said is as true for us as it is for them.

<p>Is she <i>still</i> around? Sigh&hellip; Seems so!!</p>
<p><i>We cannot &hellip; be worried that some people will say, &lsquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re playing the race card.&rsquo; Those of us who are willing to step outside the box and fight for justice and equality must be prepared to take the criticism and make the sacrifice.</i></p>
<p>O, you hypocritical liar!! You, who received a pass from the House Ethics Committee!  Even <i>Barney Frank</i> warned you to steer clear of OneUnited Bank   &mdash;   but you, Mad Max, <i>know</i>, you KNOW you have a lethal weapon in your arsenal, one that makes the GOP instantly cringe in horror, become spineless wimps and jellyfish, back off and down while scraping and groveling righteously at your feet! You have power that makes you Omnipotent:  The Race Card!  O, The Power That you Wield!</p>
<p><i>Last summer, the House Ethics Committee charged the entrenched California congresswoman with three violations related to her wheeling and dealing on behalf of minority-owned OneUnited Bank in Los Angeles. The panel accused Waters of bringing discredit to the House for using her influence to seek and secure taxpayer-subsidized special favors for the failing financial institution.</i></p>
<p>OneUnited executives donated $12,500 to Waters&rsquo; congressional campaigns. Her husband, Sidney Williams, was an investor in one of the banks that merged into OneUnited. His stock holdings were estimated at $350,000. </p>
<p><i>Eleven months have passed since the House ethics panel charged Waters. But to date, there has been no action. No trial. No consequences.</i></p>
<p>Yet Kerosine Maxine screeched on the House floor about Newt Gingrich&rsquo;s ethics case:</p>
<p><i>&#8216;The house ethics committee found the Speaker guilty guilty guilty!.. . it&rsquo;s about time, believe me the American people do not appreciated double standard&hellip; no one should be so big, so important, so powerful, that they can violate the rules of this house and the laws of this country and not suffer the consequences&rsquo;&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Hypocrite!</p>
<p>You see, she&rsquo;s played The Race Card in the past, and it&rsquo;s worked just fine!:</p>
<p><i>In 1979, former Black Panther, Joanne Chesimard, gunned down a New Jersey State Highway Patrol Officer. A jury convicted her of murder, and sentenced her to life in prison. In a daring breakout, Chesimard escaped from prison and fled to Cuba. Congress passed a unanimous resolution urging Castro to send Chesimard back to America and face charges. Maxine, however, wrote Castro a letter, urging him to let her stay, stating &#8216;she was persecuted as a result of her political beliefs and affiliations.&rsquo; Maxine further likened her to Martin Luther King!</i></p>
<p>Maxine has a Life Pass to do or say anything she pleases by virtue of the fact that she&rsquo;s black; questioning her puts oneself at great risk, as you will be axiomatically and loudly denounced as a racist. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s long past time to Drain the Swamp and send Maxine back where she came from!!</p>

		<p>vote early and vote often you get $10 each time you vote.  The NAACP is aware of race too bad many whites are not.  I recall the bus loads of voters in FLorida coming in that were scraped off the sidewalk by the Democrats.  How many times did they vote at different polling places?  ID is a great idea at least they will have to change fake IDs to vote again.  Colorado was investigating 25,000 cases of voter fraud.  new mexico soon to part of greater mexico allows illegals to vote locally since they live there.  Only takes a wink and a nod to import bus loads of voters from Mexico.  Obama promises amnesty recall.</p>

<p>Yes they can. Sounds like adding just another excuse for blacks (which they love)&hellip;Saying it&rsquo;s not their fault due to genetics or IQ or whatever is just giving them more ammunition.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. There are lots of nice Mexican Americans, Mexicans. Sure we have big problems with illegal immigration, LaRaza types - but Mexicans on average are less hostile, less destructive than low class Blacks like this idiot Maxine Waters.</p>
<p>I encourage our Mexican American readers to please, PLEASE take advantage of the changing demographics to vote this idiot Black Maxine Waters out of Congress. Put in one of your own - try to make him a little more pro America, less anti White - look at Cubans in South Florida.</p>
<p>The establishment will fight tooth and nail to prevent Hispanics from taking over traditionally Black Lib/Leftist offices  - it&rsquo;s supposed to be carved in stone that all Hispanics go for Jessie Jackson&rsquo;s Rainbow Coalition - where all non White poor unite to attack White people, White America. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>
<p>The 1992 Rodney King riots represented the end of Black rule/Black terror in Southern California - time to give left overs like Rep. Maxine Waters the boot.</p>

		<p>I play the race card every chance I get.   Whenever I see a photo of a group that is 100% Whites Only, I praise God for it and immediately save it to my hard drive.   </p>
<p>Do you have any idea what a relic of White Humanity these will be in a few years.  A true rarity.</p>
<p>With as much pressure as Whites have to always include a few &#8220;others&#8221; with them at all their outings and photos, to find pure Whiteness in a contemporary photo is glorious.  How did these girls resist the demands that they &#8220;reflect Diversity and inclusion&#8221;?</p>

<p>God bless them! Perhaps they aren&rsquo;t the ones who are saying &#8220;Making White babies is a hate crime against global dignity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Requiring photo IDs, and restrictions against ex-felons is heinous Jim Crow-style behavior? This is a legitimate, lawful action by Republicans to prevent the other side, Dems, from playing dirty by making it easier for those not legally eligible to vote (ex-felons, and illegals) to do so, both of which are groups that overwhelming support Dems who are light on crime and heavy on spending for social programs. </p>
<p>If Ms. Waters took more seriously her duties as a representative of the US government, she might not be so willing to oppose measures that restrict criminal, unconstitutional behavior.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before.  It shows how anyone can register to vote.</p>
<p>My sister married a European.  They have lived in several countries, but mostly Germany.  My sister and her husband have a lot of English friends.  My home is their US address.</p>
<p>One summer my sister and 3 English friends came to visit.  My sister stayed with me while her friends went off to tour the US.<br>
My sister wanted to register to vote.  She didn&rsquo;t trust the cards shown in every post office and library because she had filled out the forms before and never got registered.</p>
<p>So she went down to the registrar of voters.  She had her passport, US driver&rsquo;s license with my address on it, German driver&rsquo;s license, birth certificate and some letters sent to her at my address.  Living in Europe, she thought she needed all those things.</p>
<p>All the registrar did was give her a form to fill out.  She was not asked to produce one piece of identifitcation.  She did get registererd and has voted absentee in elections ever since.</p>
<p>Her 3 friends came back from their trip 2 weeks later.  We told them how my sister registered to vote without identification.</p>
<p>The girls decided to see if they could vote.  So they, with their noticable English accents went down to the registrras office and registerd to vote again without producing any identification.  They still are eligible to vote in US elections by absentee ballot.</p>
<p>You need a govt ID even for a library card. You need a govt ID to stay in a hotel.  You even need a govt ID to buy an amtrak ticket. Blacks probably have more govt ID than other ethnic groups.  Food stamp cards, welfare cards, public hospital cards, medi-aid cards, SSI cards on and on.</p>
<p>But blacks are the special people chosen by our elites to be above all the requirements demanded of Whites.</p>
<p>The solid black voting blocks that swing states like New York, Illinois and others into the Democrat camp are being destroyed by the elites sponsorship of massive hispanic immigration and section 8.</p>
<p>The hispanics move into the black ghettoes.  The blacks move to scattered section 8 in the suburbs and rural areas.  Those massive churches and their crooked preachers won&rsquo;t follow.</p>
<p>Even if they continue to vote without ID, black voting blocs that influence elections are on the way out.</p>

		<p>NAACP is totally funded by corporate and government donations.<br>
The President of their fundraising section is the President and CEO of AT&T.;</p>
<p>Here are some donors.  Walmart, Wachovia, standard oil, Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, Target, Safeway,Heinz, Armour, farmer John, Tyson foods, Foster Farms, Verizon, I-Wireless, Kroger, Sears, Federated Department stores (most department stores in the country) Chase manhattan bank, continental Ill bank, Manfuacturers Hanover Bank, Mobile Oil, Ford, Chrysler, GM, Kaufman &amp; Broad  Doelger, Peter Kiewit, Crown Zellerbach, Kraft, Hillton Knowles, Hyatt, Holiday Inn, Hilton the list goes on and on. </p>
<p> Every time we buy food or gas or bank we give money to the corporate elite that is destroying us through their support of MAACP and all the other anti White organizations such as SPLC/ADL/ACLU/MALDEF/NOW.</p>
<p>If we Whites ever get ourselves organized and get some money the first step would be to hire the best lobbyists to write and get passed a law totally eliminating tax deductible donations to any entity including religions, hospitals and schools.</p>
<p>That will cut off the billions of dollars given every year to ADL/ACLU/SPLC and the rest of the liberal organizations dedicated to destroying us.</p>
<p>The racist liberal foundations such as Tides, Ford, Carnegie, Woods, would cease to exist and would be unable to give the billions per year they now donate to anti White racist organizations and attorneys.</p>

		<p>Something which the black lunatics aren&rsquo;t telling you, even though they know better   &mdash;   If you go to a polling place and don&rsquo;t have photo ID, you&rsquo;ll still get a yellow colored provisional ballot.  You can vote that ballot, and after the election, the county BOEC will follow up to make sure you&rsquo;re qualified to vote and live where you say you live (even if you don&rsquo;t have any photo ID), and if you do, then they count your vote.</p>

		<p><i>Maxine has become nothing more than a laughing stock; in the same category as the rest of the Geriatric Black Collar Comedy Team: Sharpton, Jackson, &amp; Lowery.</i></p>
<p> To Shawn:  Would that they were laughing stocks, but publicly they are not.</p>
<p>Laughing stocks do not wield the power that $harpton, Jack$son, Lowery, and Kerosene Maxine do.  Make no mistake:  They are dangerous and will NEVER be called out for anything they do, however perfidious or felonious.</p>
<p>These jokers appear on CNN, MSNBC (where Sharpton was recently rewarded with his own 6 PM, prime-time show), &#8220;advise&#8221; POTUS and shake down major corporations.  Any/all candidates for either party must properly mau-mau to these idiots, and, as much as they may dislike it, enter Harlem to kiss the Ring of Sharpton, bow down and show proper deference.</p>
<p>As stated above, both Democrats and Republicans become spineless wimps in their presence and bow instantly to their demands, <i>no matter what</i>.  Congressional ethics inquisitions suddenly dry up, racist comments about Jews and Whites are excused, calls of &#8220;no justice no peace&#8221; to incite rioters, AHEM, &#8220;social insurrectionists&#8221; are ignored.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s power, baby, raw power! (that no White has a prayer of wielding).</p>
<p>The Race Card trumps all others.</p>
<p><i>The 1992 Rodney King riots represented the end of Black rule/Black terror in Southern California - time to give left overs like Rep. Maxine Waters the boot.</i></p>
<p>Jack:  </p>
<p>I agree that mexicans are not as violent as blacks, however, don&rsquo;t think they support Whites, or ever will!!  The ones who seek political power and are voted into office are for the most part anti-White, and virulently so   &mdash;   products of racist organizations like LaRaza that call for Whites to vacate &#8220;Aztlán&#8221;, to get off &#8220;their land&#8221; or be killed off (but not before handing over our wealth first).  </p>
<p>These mexican politicians are White-hating ethno-centrics, widely supported by &#8220;their people.&#8221;  And they are winning.  I should know, I live in California and see it all around me, increasing, in fact, every day.  Some here have called for &#8220;bombing California out of existence&#8221; but from what I read  on this forum and others, mexicans are increasing exponentially all across the US   &mdash;   from Arizona to Montana to the Dakotas, up into New England, Georgia, Arkansas, and across the South.  This means our fate will be yours, what with unfettered immigration and disparate birth rates.</p>
<p>The White Genocide Project reports the following about hate directed at Whites by mexicans, including <b>killing</b> Whites:</p>
<p>Jose Angel Gutierrez, Professor of political science and Director of the Mexican-American Studies Center at the University of Texas </p>
<p><i>Our devil has pale skin and blue eyes&hellip;</i> <br>
<i>We have got to eliminate the gringo, and what I mean by that is if the worst comes to the worst, we have got to kill him.</i> </p>
<p>or:  Mario Obledo (former California secretary of health and welfare and co-founder of Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund: </p>
<p><i>We&rsquo;re going to take over all the political institutions of California. California is going to be a Hispanic state and anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like it should leave. If they [Anglos] don&rsquo;t like Mexicans, they ought to go back to Europe.</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think these statements are isolated; they are not.  And they mean it. </p>
