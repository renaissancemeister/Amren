<h1>His Parents Said, &#8216;Not With a White Girl&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diane Farr, CNN, July 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I fell for &#8220;The Giant Korean&#8221; at a weekend-long destination wedding. I couldn&rsquo;t yet pronounce either of his real names (Seung or Yong) and although his friends called him &#8220;Sing,&#8221; I stuck with the catch phrase my girlfriends and I had coined the first time I met him because, frankly, my nickname captured his presence better.</p>
<p>I had come around to a slight Americanization of his real name by the first time we exchanged &#8220;I love yous,&#8221; but it seemed of little consequence when Seung then added that I would never be welcome in his family&rsquo;s home. Seung had been told, all his life, more or less, that he was not allowed to marry someone like me.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yes, it was white privilege that blinded me to the fact I might be the bottom of the barrel on someone else&rsquo;s race card.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But truthfully, I was blindsided for personal reasons, too. Years before this I had fought with my own mother over our family&rsquo;s prejudices when it came to love.</p>
<p>I had more than one black boyfriend in my twenties, and a few others in shades between olive and dark brown. When my parents said that one of them shouldn&rsquo;t be invited to our holiday table, I stopped showing up also.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I knew their prejudices came from the ignorance of confusing economics, education and opportunity with culture. But they simultaneously taught me that I had a right to speak up for what I believed and to defend my choices.</p>
<p>I only had the gumption to fight them and eventually end their narrow-mindedness because they showed me so much love.</p>
<p>So I found it particularly saddening to be back in the same mess, 15 years later, dressed in different robes. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead, when he told me his parents would never let him be with a white girl, I stared into his eyes and smiled. Not because I was feeling his plight but because I&rsquo;d become cautious of him.</p>
<p>This man I had woken up with earlier in the day now seemed like a stranger to me. Specifically, he seemed like someone of another culture that I didn&rsquo;t know or understand. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Using my words, gently and respectfully, in many, many, many subsequent conversations about how I felt did in fact lead Seung Yong and I to marry  &mdash;  with the full support of all our parents.</p>
<p>But it was only through continuous dialogue  &mdash;  at the dinner table with friends who could advise us, and using calm voices in the bedroom with one another, and keeping an open mind on the couch at the therapist&rsquo;s office  &mdash;  that we were able to find a way to make our familial cultures meet in the middle at our mutual American one.</p>
<p>Seven years later and three half-Asian/half-Caucasian children deep, the discussion of race rarely comes up in our home. But only because we worked so hard to make sure the inconsistencies we were both taught in our parents&rsquo; homes about what kinds of people were worthy to love would never be a part of our home or life together.</p>

		<p>Her full biography describes her as an athiest, actress and writer of books giving love advice. </p>
<p>In her 41 years as an anti-white activist, she&rsquo;s used her body as a prop to make anti-white statements, dating numerous &#8220;black men and shades of olive or brown&#8221;.</p>
<p>Just another self-loathing Hollywood liberal with parental issues, trying to be anything but a conservative white.</p>

		<p>What a poor mentally unstable woman, I have a lot of sympathy for her parents.</p>
<p>It must be saddening to do everything to you can to raise your children correctly, only to fail because the wires up top somehow got crossed the wrong way.</p>
<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s simply hilarious how she&rsquo;s so blind to what a gigantic bigot she is(no doubt due to her aforementioned mental problems - but no sympathy for her, as she&rsquo;s being given air time to spout her insanity).  &#8220;White privilege?&#8221;  Ah yes, the privilege to be denied jobs, university spots, scholarships and so much more simply due to our white skin color.  Not to mention freedom of association - what&rsquo;s that?  You don&rsquo;t want any blacks living next to you?  Well too bad!  Not building low income housing is racist, and the fed will sue you!  What a marvelous &#8220;privilege.&#8221;  Say, what I just described sounds a lot like a certain system I remember being run by a country called South Africa a few decades back&hellip;  </p>
<p>She also talks about her half-breed(I don&rsquo;t say this with any malice, it&rsquo;s simply a fact) children like she wasn&rsquo;t doing them a disservice simply by having them.  Such children often grow up confused and resentful, and nearly always end up picking one or the other race to identify with anyways.</p>
<p>&#8220;the discussion of race rarely comes up in our home.&#8221;<br/>
If your children are are anything but mentally retarded, or in possession of that one gene that makes people suicidally kind as well as unaware of race, it doesn&rsquo;t need to.  They&rsquo;ll figure it out all on their own.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  -  Doesn&rsquo;t look like her &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; gave her such an advantage after all.  She was not wanted by the other&rsquo;s family BECAUSE she was white.  Sounds like she had a &#8216;disadvantage&rsquo; because of her race.</p>
<p>Ah well, she fought so long and hard to marry a guy who appears not to have wanted her all that much, and pushed herself into a family that likewise didn&rsquo;t really want her.  Now she is married to an asian guy and living in a family that avoids all mention of race on a daily basis.  Imagine the constant background stress!</p>
<p>I just met a cousin for the first time.  She had two, out-of-wedlock, half black/white kids.  One of them came up to me and willfully tried to snatch something out of my hand.  I saw which race had the upper hand in his admixture.  </p>
<p>What is it about blond white girls and black guys?  The girls pursue the black boys as much as they pursue them!  I have seen so much of it in the last few years that I have come to naturally expect that there is a 50/50 chance of any random blond girl having a black guy walking with her hand-in-hand.</p>

		<p>Pathetic.</p>
<p>I still remember my 12 year-old blonde sister coming home from school and proudly declaring that she now had to have a mulatto boyfriend (not that she even knew one at the time) &#8220;because everything else would be racist&#8221;. (I simply told her &#8220;Sis, you cannot walk 20 meters in MY city with a [assorted racism and blasphemy, rather colourful] without me knowing inside three hours.&#8221; And that did it. I was never much into gangs but everybody on the streets knew me and my sisters. I would have known.) That was three decades ago. Is this what we have come to?</p>
<p>- Crass I find the dame actually bragging about shagging anything as long as it wasn´t white. But judging by Obama´s mama, the phenomenon is not exactly recent. That it is centrally promoted should be evident.</p>

		<p>It could be worse.  Her husband could be black.  Her kids could be mulattoes. </p>
<p>From what I read on this website it seems like many commenters have an all-or-nothing mentality in regards to miscegenation.  Either whites marry and reproduce with whites (good) or they marry and reproduce with non-whites (bad).  I consider it a loss for whites and Asians if they choose to mate with blacks, but not a loss if they choose to mate with each other.  The IQ gap between whites and Asians is about 5 points.  I don&rsquo;t think I need to remind anyone that the IQ gap between whites and blacks is 15.</p>

<p>Bleached blondes, maybe, sometimes. Actually, in my highly-white college town, the girls who seem to go after black men the most ardently are the mixed-race ones. And, for whatever reason, it seems to be mixed-race boys who are most likely to turn out gay. Maybe there&rsquo;s a connection   &mdash;   such as, mixing races being bad for kids.</p>

		<p>Not because she was rejected by an Asian family means that <br/>
there is no white privilege. In interracial relationship whites<br/>
probably are less likely to be rejected by the other family than other racial groups are.<br/>
It should not be totally shocking that a family wanted their<br/>
son to marry a person&rsquo;s of his race. You can find family members<br/>
in almost all racial group who have that prejudice.<br/>
Moreover, Asian females are portrayed most often by many<br/>
white males as the &#8216;perfect&rsquo; wife as &#8216;American&rsquo; women  are considered too bossy and not feminine. <br/>
One evidence is a post on Amren about Chinese men seeking wives<br/>
from the west(Chinese men looking west). Many posters on Amren wrote how naive these<br/>
men were to want American women (a code word for white women)<br/>
as if something was wrong with American women.<br/>
Maybe other people including her husband family are influenced<br/>
by the negative portrayal of American women by American men.<br/>
And they believed that an Asian woman would make a better <br/>
wife for their son.</p>

<p>To me this says it all. If miscegenation were healthy and normal and for that matter, if racial diversity were healthy and normal, you wouldn&rsquo;t need, &#8220;continuous dialogue &mdash; at the dinner table with friends who could advise us, and using calm voices in the bedroom with one another, and keeping an open mind on the couch at the therapist&rsquo;s office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that many White girls today are specifically seeking non-White men, but we have to remember that this is all cultural Marxism, to some degree at least, and that all this is just the result of a century or more of cultural brainwashing.</p>
<p>I remember seeing some statistics about interracial marriages that showed they don&rsquo;t last as long as mono racial ones. Of course, that won&rsquo;t stop White girls from betraying their race and ignoring all the logic, history, culture and well everything that Europeans did to build this country or the modern, civilized world. Europeans didn&rsquo;t contribute to this country, THEY BUILT IT!</p>
<p>This was on the Council of Conservative Citizens site recently, </p>
<p>&#8220;Despite the refusal of the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Zahi Hawass, to release any DNA results which might indicate the racial ancestry of Pharaoh Tutankhamen, the leaked results reveal that King Tut&rsquo;s DNA is a 99.6 percent match with Western European Y chromosomes.</p>
<p>The DNA test results were inadvertently revealed on a Discovery Channel TV documentary filmed with Hawass&rsquo;s permission  &mdash;  but it seems as if the Egyptian failed to spot the giveaway part of the documentary which revealed the test results.</p>
<p>Hawass previously announced that he would not release the racial DNA results of Egyptian mummies  &mdash;  obviously because he feared the consequences of such a revelation.&#8221; </p>

		<p>At least her kids aren&rsquo;t HALF BLACK who would ALWAYS identify as black AND the father is probably still around and they know him. FAR FAR better half Asian than ANY percentage of black kids. She is also very stupid, perhaps the Asian half will out balance that.</p>

		<p>Why should she be surprised that his parents would say, &#8220;Not with a white girl&#8221;? From her past dating habits it would appear her own preference was, &#8220;Not with a white guy&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are plenty of attractive and intelligent people who have a defective mentality   &mdash;   for lack of a better word. And I&rsquo;m not convinced such a defect isn&rsquo;t at least partially hereditary. Rather than becoming disappointed by such I try to remember that natural selection may well be served by eliminating these <i>weak links</i>. Both of their parents have my condolences.</p>

<p>   My sympathy actually goes to &#8220;The Giant Korean&#8221;; he didn&rsquo;t exactly get a treasure in his marriage. It sounds like she willfully and rebelliously dated minority men to get back at her &#8220;prejudiced&#8221; parents. Such an &#8220;in-your-face&#8221; attitude usually doesn&rsquo;t make for a happy or enduring marriage. <br/>

		<p>She said it all in her last sentence;  In order to marry outside of your race, you must destroy your culture.  Their children will be rootless,and the likelihood that they will get involved in pop-culture, drugs, and risky lifestyles is higher than those who &#8220;stay close to home.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Come on&hellip;.there are quite a few posters on Amren who are in, or have been in relationships with Asian women. Hardly anyone raises a fuss.</p>
<p>In fact white men have been chasing women well before the modern era. It has even been celebrated in white culture, to a certain extent ala pocahontas, madame butterfly etc.</p>
<p>So what if a white woman dates an Asian man occassionally? There are a heck of a lot more white men with Asian women. </p>

		<p><i>If miscegenation were healthy and normal and for that matter</i></p>
<p>In a way it is healthy and normal. Look at everywhere on the earth that the white man has gone. He has miscegenated the natives out of existence. Look at South America, the Pacific. In New Zealand and North America there is hardly a full blooded native left.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure those white men who were into miscegenating so much, hardly did so to make a political statement on equality of the races or something like that.</p>
<p>They were simply satisfying a very normal and healthy urge - the sexual urge.</p>

		<p>Our educational system promotes this race mixing.  I have noted that younger white girls with black men often look lost and alone like they have no way out of the situation they are in.  I have talked to many women who were caught up in college radicalism and had black kids and the fathers left them when the good times ended.  now they are stuck with mixed race kids and no one will marry them with the black kids.  The college profs and the black fathers are gone and they face cold reality.  They are victims of liberalism and lack of having a strong racial identity.</p>

<p>Who would want to marry such a *ahem* lady? I know a girl who is exactly the same.  From a very stable, loving, middle class family, well educated, good job, good looking.  Since I&rsquo;ve known her she&rsquo;s had THREE boyfriends from Nigeria (she&rsquo;s a doctor, has she never heard of AIDS?), and is currently in a relationship with an arrogant, highly strung, quick-to-take-offense, VERY dark-skinned Indian guy.  She may be very attractive, but when I see her, she just looks ugly to me. I know her parents.  Even though on the surface, they approve, deep down they&rsquo;re disgusted.  But being nice, middle class, left-leaning, liberal thinking people, they just smile and pretend its all good.  </p>

<p>This woman puts a great deal of effort into making her relationships work; with her lovers, her parents, and her lover&rsquo;s parents. She seems obsessed with trying to make the world conform to her belief system.</p>
<p>Normal, natural, healthy relationships shouldn&rsquo;t take effort.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Yes, it was white privilege that blinded me to the fact I might be the bottom of the barrel on someone else&rsquo;s race card.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Is that how she sees the situation; that&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s the bottom of the barrel to someone else?</p>
<p>Asians have long believed that Caucasians were brutes and barbarians. I&rsquo;m fine with that. Someone&rsquo;s opinion of me in no way affects what I feel about myself nor does it make me want to change their minds. They can have their opinion and I can have mine and each of us can live happy lives.</p>
<p>What this women doesn&rsquo;t seem to find odd is that she appears to be attracted to any many who isn&rsquo;t white. I don&rsquo;t recall her saying she ever dated a white man. Doesn&rsquo;t she see white men as attractive? Does she find them repulsive?</p>

		<p>The Korean guy made a huge mistake.  He could have had a nice, young, beautiful Korean girl as his wife.  Instead he chose an aging, e-list celeb who doesn&rsquo;t understand any culture except that of extreme liberalism and white guilt.  I feel sorry for him.  </p>
<p>I love those Korean Air commercials.  Absolutely no diversity at all.  No blacks.  Just white models and hot Korean hostesses.  It must drive the diversitards nuts.  </p>

		<p>The only times I&rsquo;ve seriously dated outside of my race have been with Asians. My first girlfriend was Japanese. She was a (not terribly distant) descendant of the Yamamoto clan   &mdash;   the Isoroku Yamamoto (although he wasn&rsquo;t born into that clan, he was adopted into the clan) that rose to high ranks in the Japanese Navy. Much of their hated goes back to the second world war, and many of their extended relatives were killed in that war. Her family hated me. Her father hated me so much, and hated the idea of their daughter being involved with a white boy that they moved her back to Japan to keep us apart.  She was polite, pretty, incredibly smart, always questioning, and somewhat demanding. </p>
<p>I had often wondered why if they disliked American&rsquo;s so much that their family had came here to work, and to ensure their children got an American education. (Albeit at very expensive private schools.)I&rsquo;ve since learned its not that they dislike American&rsquo;s, its that they want pure Japanese grandchildren. So be it; I understand the urge.  </p>
<p>I had no problems dating her other than her family. The Japanese have their prejudices the same as white people do, and have some reasons that aren&rsquo;t entirely invalid to look down on our culture. I didn&rsquo;t come from money. I came from a mix of hardworking Scots on my Dad&rsquo;s side, and crazy Canadian French on my mom&rsquo;s side. My father studies engineering, worked as an engineer in the army, but he made his living as a pressman. My mother built nuclear weapons for a living. We were not poor, but we were not rich either; especially not rich after we started arms reduction with the Russians. I never really got the chance to see if we could make that work. </p>
<p>I dated a Filipino woman as well. Her family loved me. They became US citizens when her father joined the US Navy, and served his entire adult life in the Navy. Her father was a good guy, and I had no issues with him, and he none with me (that he ever voiced). Her mother treated me better than my own parents did. Her immediate family was great to me, but their was an expectation in Filipino culture that I couldn&rsquo;t grok. In American culture you get to a certain point, and you largely become independent of your family. In Filipino culture you are beholden even to distant relatives, and they all become an aunt, or mom at some level no matter what their actual status is. They wanted us to take on an &#8220;aunt&#8221; that had a few problems, and we were expected to support her.  This issue, a few other culture problems, and the want of a 30K+ wedding were the deal breakers for me.  </p>
<p>By, and large I don&rsquo;t have a big problem with Japanese, or Koreans, or even Filipinos (who are considered the dogs of the orient) coming here so long as they can blend in, and eventually adopt the culture. The ones I&rsquo;ve known well have, with the exception of how they view extended family.  Having 100 people show up at a family event is actually kind of cool in many ways. Not all of them were successful. Some worked as housekeepers, others as engineers, others in government positions (many followed the path that was laid out, and joined the US Navy). </p>
<p>No Japanese has ever cheated me, held a gun to my head, or pointed a knife at me. No Korean has ever cheated me, held a gun to my head, or pointed a knife at me; they have haggled on price, and tried to renegotiate deals in the middle of them, but its a trait I understand. No Filipino has ever cheated me, pointed a gun at me, or held me at knife point. Their respective cultures have their drawbacks, good things, and they have their prejudices as well, but on the whole they aren&rsquo;t out here causing problems. If hundreds of Japanese were moving in my neighborhood, it wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue for me.  I love white people, and I love white culture   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve never felt these folks are a threat to it, nor to a decent neighborhood. I haven&rsquo;t known that many Chinese personally, so I can&rsquo;t comment on them. </p>
<p>Mexicans, and Blacks on the other hand   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve had lots of problems with. Mexicans for violating social norms here in the extreme, no effort to assimilate, rudeness, hostility toward whites, being here illegally, no insurance, drunk driving (and hard drinking &hellip;I&rsquo;m a Scot - and loving the drink is a part of our culture too, but we know when to say when, and we don&rsquo;t do it on a workday), and mostly property crime.  Blacks   &mdash;   its low intelligence, rudeness, a culture that isn&rsquo;t compatible, little effort to blend in &amp; assimilate, extreme prejudice, an entitlement mentality, violent crime, property crime, open hostility at nearly ever turn, and nearly every pathology you can think of in its most glaring form. </p>
<p>If my sons or my daughter decided to date a Japanese, or Korean - I&rsquo;m not going to blink twice at it.  This is not something that is going to be detrimental to the gene pool IMHO. So long as both families are fine with it, and it wont deprive them of having grandparents, and extended children should they marry - I don&rsquo;t see the big issue.   However, if my children started dating blacks, and Mexicans   &mdash;   I would have a much harder time with it. There are tiers here, and they exist for a reason. Much like my Japanese girlfriend&rsquo;s family would not accept me   &mdash;   black culture would never accept a mixed child, and there is no way I would want a child raised in a culture I feel is highly defective. While the Mexican&rsquo;s might be a cut above that, its still a screwed up culture, and those children wouldn&rsquo;t be accepted in either culture either. Its not even that I hate black people, or Mexicans   &mdash;   I don&rsquo;t, I just don&rsquo;t think their cultures, attitudes, and lifestyles are good for my country, neighborhood, community, and for my family. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t harbor any ill will toward anyone who thinks my view of this is wrong either. I was raised extremely liberal, but have shaken most of that off as I&rsquo;ve aged. If Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos were behaving badly here, destroying our way of live, making problems for the rest of us   &mdash;   I would view them in the same dark light I do Blacks &amp; Mexicans. I can understand any White person who wants pure White children, and grandchildren. I can also understand the ones who think my view is &#8220;selling out&#8221; our race. I just don&rsquo;t agree with them. </p>

		<p>I have absolutely no interest to promote interracial relationships or interracial marriages or in seeing the Caucasian race becoming scarce or extinct.  </p>
<p>The aspect of AmRen I like and respect most is neither the fact that the East Asian race appears to be the only non-white race that manages to be respected here, nor do I have any intention to defend my own race or try to convince anyone else on AmRen that we are smarter than any other race.  </p>
<p>The aspect of AmRen I like most is I get to read a lot of things that the left-wing mainstream media constantly make great efforts to hide to the general public, and I never have to worry about being called a racist here.  </p>
<p>As for me, I decided not to look for a relationship until the end of the year.  To quote one of the most beloved men in the world of all-time, Homer Simpson, &#8220;I must take care of some unfinished business&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>And so, rather than try to teach this young lady about real life by setting basic standards which were enforced on a contingency by contingency basis with real world examples, it sounds like her parents adopted &#8216;socio political generalism&rsquo; as a one size fits all approach to a typical 60s-80s idealization of egality and social responsibility.</p>
<p>Big surprise, they don&rsquo;t like one of her boyfriends because (attitude, crudity, felony past, violence) and she automatically jumps on the race bandwagon because&hellip; this is the one readily identifiable condition by which she can make _herself_ feel like an individual &#8216;with a cause&rsquo; that is unique to the moment.  Never mind all the other boytoys she brought home that they did put up with.</p>
<p>The sad part is that when such personal issues marry and reproduce under the guise of political agendism, it&rsquo;s _always_ the kids who end up carrying the baggage as much as torch another generation ahead, often without clue one as to what they inherited as subconscious stresses to begin with.</p>
<p>Women are the gene accomodators of any race, helping bring in new bloodlines.  As such, they tend to have fairly weak internalized identities on a lot of issues to be less insular.  As such, especially in a multicult society on the backslide like ours, they need a LOT of specific situational reinforcement rather than generalization.</p>
<p>So that whatever their choices may be, they are at least equipped with a range of responses that bring appropriate square peg:square hole compareables to any &#8216;what you like vs. what you should&rsquo; condition.</p>

		<p> &#8220;He has miscegenated the natives out of existence. Look at South America, the Pacific. In New Zealand and North America there is hardly a full blooded native left.&#8221; &#8220;Wayne&#8221;</p>
<p>The majority of AR posters don&rsquo;t find this miscegenation particularly attractive. We oppose the &#8220;great liberal dream&#8221; of the elimination of racism through miscegenation. </p>
<p>I also don&rsquo;t agree that whites have miscegenated &#8220;natives out of existence&#8221; in &#8220;South America&#8221;. A quick check of the CIA Factbook for the ethnic/racial makeup of just two Latin American countries, Bolivia and Peru, are as follows&#8221;</p>
<p>1. Peru: 45% Amerindian, 37% Mestizo, 15% white, 3% Japanese Chinese other</p>
<p>2. Bolivia: 30% Ouehua (Amerindian), 30% Mestizo, 25% Aymara (Amerindian), 15% white </p>
<p> I&rsquo;d say that whites, not the Amerindians, have almost been miscegenated out of existence in both Peru and Bolivia. Whites were never the majority in most Latin American and Caribbean nations, Chile and Argentina being exceptions. In fact, white women were in scarce supply during colonial times in many parts of Latin America.</p>

		<p>For the last time.  All you Asiaphiles on Amren need to stop with your plan B promotion of an Asian/White race dilution while trying to cop out by saying &#8220;at least it&rsquo;s not a black person&#8221;.  </p>
<p>With lower white birth rates, the last thing we can afford is to have more white females jumping onto the race mixing bandwagon.  In addition, it scares me that even some Asian males have jumped onto the &#8220;bag a white girl&#8221; bandwagon like the fella featured in this article.  I live in the Pacific Northwest in a city that has a material amount of East Asians.  I was eating at a diner last week and I could have swore it was &#8220;Bring your mixed Asian/White Kid Out Night&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Not one, not two, but three Asian Male/White female grouping (all of whom with kids).  I nearly choked on my pasta.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, I am also against this paring because in areas of heavy Asian population, a lot of the mixed race Asians youths (byproducts of the White Male/ Asian Female paring) will often date and marry other full bred Asians simply because of ratios readily available nearby.  </p>
<p>So not only are you now diluting the gene pool, you are potentially BREEDING OUT the white gene altogether.  </p>
<p>Get your heads out of the sand people!</p>

<p>OK then. Point taken. So I take it that whites would be happy if England went from 90% white (what it is now) to 45% pure white (as Amerindians are in Peru), and German whites were reduced to 30% of Germany?</p>

		<p>The Poster in #30 stated between 2 posts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way it is healthy and normal. Look at everywhere on the earth that the white man has gone. He has miscegenated the natives out of existence. Look at South America, the Pacific. In New Zealand and North America there is hardly a full blooded native left.</p>
<p>Afterall it is OK for Amerinds. Why not whites?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who said it&rsquo;s okay for anyone?</p>
<p>It is important to note that it was NOT miscegenation that wiped out natives such as Pacific Islanders and Amerinds.  It was actually disease brought by Europeans that the body systems of these natives had no immunity to and such diseases were not necessarily spread by sexual contact.  In college my textbooks reported that 90% of the Amerinds died of exposure to Old World disease.  Islanders had no contact with these germs before interacting with White explorers that stopped at the islands and had no immunity either.  Clearly the ramifications for these indigenous people were catastrophic.</p>
<p>The notion that the devastation of these non-White gene pools was due to rabid White miscegenation is just flat-out false. Moreover it is disingenuous to spin this nonsense as evidence that Whites are dying to miscegenate.  The first day I read this website some years back an astute White male poster pointed out that if Whites (male or female) were really that into race-mixing that there would be no &ldquo;racism&rdquo; and the Whites themselves would have been mixed out of existence long ago since they would have sought non-White mates.  An obvious question here is if historically White males were that hungry for the black female slaves,  Amerinds, Islanders and the women of Chinatown why didn&rsquo;t they marry them en masse instead of White women?  They could have, right?  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not how it&rsquo;s turned out though is it?  If Whites are so into mixing why do we have phenomena such as White flight? Why Jim Crow?   Why do White children have to be forcibly bussed to non-White schools?  Why is it necessary to force White-run companies to hire non-Whites through compulsory government mandates such as aa?  Why does leftist media run endless propaganda to promote race-mixing to Whites and shame Whites that don&rsquo;t support race-mixing (like the ones in GA that wanted the White prom)?  Why is it that currently 93%+ of Whites still marry within the White race?</p>
<p>If mixing is so natural why did both sets of parents in the article here have to be bullied, cajoled and guilt-tripped into accepting the interracial union?  Why is the constant pro-mixing dialogue and counseling by a therapist needed for this couple if the race-mixing is so attractive and normal?</p>
<p>Clearly the natural instinct for most mentally-healthy members of any race is to eschew miscegenation on the grounds that it is harmful to the genetic continuation of the family. Who wants their genetic future to be strange-looking foreigners who don&rsquo;t resemble the family?  Whites only breed down when they breed out.<br/>

		<p>Poster #5 said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider it a loss for whites and Asians if they choose to mate with blacks, but not a loss if they choose to mate with each other. The IQ gap between whites and Asians is about 5 points.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bell Curve results come across as rather suspect in the manner that they try to project Asians as having a higher IQ than Whites. Real world accomplishments do not bear this out since it has been White technology as the engine that has moved mankind forward.  Bell Curve results are probably some type of propaganda tool designed to con Whites into believing that mixing themselves to extinction with Asians makes them come out big winners. Only of the Darwin Award!  I can&rsquo;t believe how many Whites on this website place more credence on the Bell Curve than on the endless concrete examples of real White achievement over any other race on the planet.</p>
<p>Asians would be 100s of years behind without White technology and invention.  If Asians are  superior or even equal they would have created a first world standard of living without White intervention and would have no need to attend our schools, immigrate legally or illegally into our countries as they do by the millions, or worst of all intermarry with Whites.</p>
<p>But aside from all this why do these discussions always fall back to the IQ argument?  Whites and Asians are very different phenotypically, genetically and culturally.  Why can&rsquo;t White people have any space anywhere to survive as Whites without some Asiaphile throwing the IQ canard at us as a reason why we should mix out the European gene pool with Asian blood?</p>
<p>I am the mother of several full-blooded White children and would be horrified if any of them brought home an Asian as a potential spouse.  My kids are raised with healthy doses of White pride administered like vitamins and so far completely reject race-mixing of any sort.</p>
<p>I do wonder what the White parents, especially the White mom, really thinks when their son with the Asian spouse presents the new HAPA grandbaby to his parents fresh from the delivery room after the c-section required in many, many more AF/WM deliveries than WM/WF births.  They gaze into the face and see Deng Xiao Ping instead of themselves, their son or any of the White family members for that matter.  Do they guiltily hide their disappointment at their genetic future being wiped out and say to themselves &ldquo;well at least the Bell Curve indicates that this baby will have a high IQ?&rdquo; Whew, what a comfort (not). I have known at least one White father in tears of disappointment at the prospect of having an Asian grandchild instead of White when his daughter had taken an Asian boyfriend.  </p>
<p>Whites are not improved by mixing with Asians, we are only made extinct. Whites mentally healthy in a racial sense realize this. <br/>

<p>You seem to &#8220;think&#8221; it is okay as long it is between a White and an Asian. I do not. I don&rsquo;t care if they are less prone to crime as blacks are. That doesn&rsquo;t even enter the picture whatsoever. The whole point is to NOT create another &#8220;race&#8221;( bi-racial) of children/people! You DILUTE the whole race(bloodline/genetics) when this occurs. In other words, the WHITE race will become extinct since we are only about 8% of the total population in the whole world! Why would any thinking, proud White person ever want that to happen? </p>

I fell in love with a few women in the past, and was in relationships a few times in the past, and the only reason I was in that particular relationship was because I fell in love with that girl, not because I thought, if I marry her and have kids with her in the future my kids have good chance to be smart kids</p>
