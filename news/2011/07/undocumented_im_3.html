<h1>Undocumented Immigrants Steer Clear of Arizona</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Valeria Fernandez, New American Media, July 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People on both sides of the immigration debate in Arizona are skeptical of new research that shows a national decrease in the flow of illegal immigration from Mexico into the United States. But there is one thing they are certain of: undocumented immigrants are steering clear of the border state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they are just avoiding Arizona,&#8221; said Jesse Hern√°ndez, a real estate agent who works in the Maryvale neighborhood where the exodus of immigrants, due to the crackdown on illegal immigration and the implosion of the housing market, is especially visible. &#8220;They are going to California and other places. No matter how much worse things are in the U.S., they are still coming over here. It&rsquo;s a human interest to look for a better opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A study released last year by BBVA Bancomer Research, a financial institution in Mexico, found that 100,000 Latinos had fled the state [Arizona] in 2010. Based on remittance information, the study estimated that about 23,000 of them were Mexican nationals who returned to Mexico from June through September 2010.</p>
<p>Beyond SB 1070, says [Mark] Krikorian, Arizona&rsquo;s experience with another immigration law pushed immigrants away. That was an employer sanctions law passed in 2007 that made it mandatory for businesses to use a federal database known as E-Verify to check the immigration status of their new hires and also made them subject to penalties if they knowingly hired unauthorized workers.</p>
<p>It was Arizona&rsquo;s success stemming the flow of illegal immigration that inspired other states to enact legislation similar to SB 1070, according to Krikorian. But he believes is too early to tell what will happen in places like Georgia that recently enacted legislation even tougher than the Arizona law.</p>

		<p>While Arizona did and still does have a lot of illegal aliens, the only silver lining in the cloud is while the Mexico-Arizona border was a favorite crossing point, many illegals didn&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t want to stay, and have designs on going elsewhere, to more invasion-friendly states.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s especially funny about this statement is that today I read nothing but bad news about California&rsquo;s financial state and how businesses are leaving/disinvesting in California at a record rate! Hmmmmm&hellip; wonder if there&rsquo;s a correlation?</p>
<p><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/28/news/economy/California_companies/index.htm?iid=HP_LN" rel="nofollow">https://money.cnn.com/2011/06/28/news/economy/California_companies/index.htm?iid=HP_LN</a></p>
<p>And lastly I actually don&rsquo;t blame Mexicans for leaving the hell hole of a nation they created for themselves and coming to the US. Who doesn&rsquo;t want to live in a safe, clean, advanced, prosperous, generous, nation filled with beautiful, friendly, smart Europeans (this seemingly mythical nation is what America once was!)? I blame us for letting them come here and turn this nation into a third world hispanic slum&hellip;</p>

		<p>Unfortunately the illegal immigrants will not go home.  Instead they will go to blue states like mine where the politicians would be horrified at the thought of enforcing immigration law.  Unless the federal government mandates the use of E-verify, there will be no hope for my state.<br>

<p>Check your history books again brother.  Our government spent millions to de-stabilize and topple governments throughout this region. When the people did make earnest and democratic attempts to make changes within their countries, they were met with American weapons and American subsidized warfare. The fact is, when people in these regions tried to make changes for the better, within their own communities, our taxpayer dollars were used to terrorize and murder these same people you accuse of wrecking their own homeland.(check CIA in Guatemala and El Salvador 1980&rsquo;s) </p>
<p>Currently, our voracious and seemingly endless appetite for drugs has resulted in a level of unimaginable violence for these people.  Our inability to govern ourselves is creating a level of chaos which is overflowing into neighboring countries. Read the headlines about how our own government is funneling illicit weapons into Mexico used not only against their people, but ours as well.  Do you really think Mexico is solely responsible for creating their own hell-hole?  </p>
<p>Wake up man, your government has blood on its hands.  Don&rsquo;t lay the blame on others. Take a look around and you&rsquo;ll see that our own country is quickly becoming a hell-hole as well. Our infrastructure is in ruins, our economy is in shambles, we are in debt up to our ears, unemployment is tragically high, incarceration rates are brimming. Our jobs have been shipped overseas and more whites than ever are on government assistance. <br>
You and I are slowing being bankrupted by a corrupt corporate backed government.</p>
<p>If we were Europeans, we get to the streets and start throwing some rocks until things changed.  But we are not&hellip; we are too frightened by our own leaders and we are too paralyzed with fear to take action. We are too lazy and too petulant to change that which requires change. </p>
<p>So in place of confronting our leaders and demanding the same voice which corporate America has so greedily enjoyed (read bailout GM,Shearson,AIG etc) We sit here and sound off in an echo chamber, recanting our former glories and reminding ourselves how great we once were, all the while blaming some other group for our downfall. </p>
<p>In the meantime, corporate America is figuring out how to strip us of what wealth we have left &hellip; but we aren&rsquo;t worried about that&hellip; it&rsquo;s an immigrant with a sixth grade education selling mangos at the side of the road that really bothers us.  Unreal!</p>

<p><i>In the meantime, corporate America is figuring out how to strip us of what wealth we have left &hellip; but we aren&rsquo;t worried about that&hellip; it&rsquo;s an immigrant with a sixth grade education selling mangos at the side of the road that really bothers us. Unreal!</i></p>
<p>Not mutually exclusive concepts.  You&rsquo;re acting like the immigration issue is a distraction from corporate perfidy.  I happen to think they&rsquo;re effect and cause, respectively.  You seem to be parroting a hobby horse of the left that the plutocrats are dangling race as a distraction away from the plutocrats.  The obvious problem with that mentality is that plutocracy and multiracialism go hand in hand.</p>
<p><i>Read the headlines about how our own government is funneling illicit weapons into Mexico used not only against their people, but ours as well. Do you really think Mexico is solely responsible for creating their own hell-hole?</i></p>
<p>As the T-shirt reads, am I the only person in the world to whom the ATF isn&rsquo;t giving guns?  They could give me every gun in the Fast &amp; Furious program, and the last thing I would think to do with any of them is to go out and murder someone.  Or they could ship the F&F; guns to Norway and give them to (real) Norwegians   &mdash;   That wouldn&rsquo;t result in a massive crime wave either.  Mexico is violent because Mexicans are violent.  Even without F&F;, a lot of guns are coming into Mexico from the international black market.</p>
<p><i>Currently, our voracious and seemingly endless appetite for drugs has resulted in a level of unimaginable violence for these people.</i></p>
<p>Maybe so, but one could argue from the other side of the coin   &mdash;   Their suppliers create our addicts.  Point being, you can&rsquo;t put all the onus on &#8220;our&#8221; drug addicts.</p>
<p><i>Check your history books again brother. Our government spent millions to de-stabilize and topple governments throughout this region. When the people did make earnest and democratic attempts to make changes within their countries, they were met with American weapons and American subsidized warfare. </i></p>
<p>Check your history books again.  Most of that &#8220;earnest and democratic attempt at change&#8221; was Soviet-financed.  Now, knowing what we know now, I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered trying to intervene if I had any political power at the time.  Let the Soviet Union occupy those bothersome Chicano troublemakers.  It&rsquo;s the same mindset I have with Afghanistan   &mdash;   Let the USSR have it.  In both instances, our aid to help those places resist the Soviets became MS-13 and Al Qaeda, which has turned right back on us.  Without our involvement, the Indios and Pashto would be picking on Moscow.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wake up man, your government has blood on its hands. Don&rsquo;t lay the blame on others. Take a look around and you&rsquo;ll see that our own country is quickly becoming a hell-hole as well. Our infrastructure is in ruins, our economy is in shambles, we are in debt up to our ears, unemployment is tragically high, incarceration rates are brimming.&#8221; -posted by #9 Steven Lopez Miranda Garcia</p>
<p>And I thought &#8220;The Man Did It!&#8221; conspiracy theories were reserved for blacks? Blaming the US for warfare and poverty in Mexico (as if it were once a utopia, ha!) is like me going home after work and beating my wife and children because my boss yelled at me. Even if my boss is a jerk (the US has blood on its hands) that is no excuse for my horrible behavior (Mexicans are ultimately responsible for the hell hole that is Mexico).</p>
<p>And about the deterioration of our country. I AGREE!! The reason it&rsquo;s &#8220;quickly becoming a hell-hole as well&#8221; is because it&rsquo;s quickly becoming a hispanic nation (=hell hole)! Hispanics engage in behavior that leads to a VERY low standard of living, simple cause and effect. If you need examples: droping out of high school, having multiple children before turing 18, high crime rates, low academic/professional/scientific/anything-that-requires-a-brain accomplishment, etc. If you are only capable of menial labor(avergae hispanic IQ=90, not much higher than blacks) then you simply can&rsquo;t trade with and be a helpful part of European civilization (ie advanced technolgy, post-industrial economies, constant innovation and discovery, etc etc).</p>
<p>As for your other points: &#8220;our economy is in shambles&#8221; = typical of hispanic economies. &#8220;we are in debt up to our ears&#8221; = absolutely! If 22yr old Maria Sanchez Garcia makes $8/hr and has 5 children the government has to spend alot of money to bring her life up to first world standards. &#8220;unemployment is tragically high&#8221; = unskilled, uneducated hispanic work force (aka the low skilled laborers out number the low skilled jobs available). &#8220;incarceration rates are brimming&#8221; = this one&rsquo;s too easy (see Hispanic crime rate).</p>
<p>I hate to break this to you Steven Lopez Miranda Garcia, but the majority of your hispanic people are only interested in (and capable of) doing menial labor for 8+ hours a day, drinking some tequila at night, then waking up next morning to do it over again. Though the work ethic is noble, work ethic alone doesn&rsquo;t create an advanced society, put a man on the moon, invent the internet, etc etc etc&hellip;&hellip;</p>
