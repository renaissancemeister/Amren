<h1><a href="http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2011/07/dolls_three_races_colorado_day_care_centers.php">Colorado Day-Care Center Proposal: Dolls Must Represent at Least Three Different Races</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Roberts, Westword (Denver), July 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>New rules proposed by the Colorado Department of Human Services include a requirement that all day-care centers in the state make available dolls representing three different races.</p>
<p>The 98-page document, obtained by 7News, features a slew of rule changes. Among them: children over age two must not be served whole milk without a note from a doctor, kids over age one can&rsquo;t drink more than six ounces of juice per day, TV and computer time will be capped at twenty minutes daily, and staffers must wear clothes that cover their lap and shoulders. But arguably the most unusual suggestion pops up on page 77: &#8220;Dolls shall represent three (3) races.&#8221;</p>
<p>After posting this item, we were able to reach Human Services spokeswoman Liz McDonough, who provides background on the project as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are national child care standards that we are proposing,&#8221; she says. &#8220;They come from national standards that are entitled &#8216;Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale.&rsquo; They&rsquo;re minimum standards for quality in childcare  &mdash;  and the process was actually started by statute back in 2000. We initially made changes in the educational levels and training required for childcare workers and redid all of our family childcare home rules back in 2004  &mdash;  and we began the rule-writing process for family childcare centers in 2006.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Only three races?  Come on, Colorado, you can be better and more diverse than that.  Seems to me you&rsquo;re excluding a lot of other races.  The young among them might get their feelings hurt if they go into a day care center and see only three kinds of dolls.  And what of other non-racial factors?</p>
<p>No, we won&rsquo;t truly be free until dolls representing all 16 races, all nine genders and all eight sexual orientations are in every Colorado day care center.  The lesbian transgendered Papua New Guinean must be made to feel like s/he is included and is wanted.</p>

		<p>I am not a huge fan of day care but the dress code and media limits are good things. I have worked at a couple of day cares where the kids were just parked by the television most of the day with either broadcast cartoons or videos. As far as having shoulders and laps covered I would do anything in my power to prevent having some sort of accusation levied against me. Stranger things have happened. The doll rule alone would make me not want to have my child in a day care!</p>

		<p>Does this include Afrocentric daycare/community centers or will this &#8216;quest for diversity&rsquo; be selectively enforced? In every large city in America there are community centers that offer after school tutoring and after school daycare. These community centers are Afrocentric in the extreme. There&rsquo;s no trying to include white dolls, white employees, or even photos or drawings of even one white person anywhere within their buildings.</p>
<p>These &#8216;community centers&rsquo; that do serve whites/areas with a high white population, are they as numerous, are whites being equally served by community-centers as to their percentage of the population? </p>
<p>In regards to the article, I guess one can look hard for discrimination and bias, but some times the effort appears to be just too much.</p>

		<p>If you stop by a day care center in Colorado next year you might see the black and Hispanic dolls positioned so they are kicking the white doll that is on the ground in the fetal position.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that by 2015 the white doll will be holding a Glock and a concealed carry permit and the other two dolls will be across the room wondering why there is no money left to pay for welfare benefits. </p>

		<p>The problem is that the further the talons of Federalism reach, the less choice we will have in determining what &#8216;standards&rsquo; shall be met according to our own common sense.</p>
<p>The ability to be lactose tolerant has added height and bone mass to children across four millenia of time and all known racial subgroups because it was such a valuable added nutritional source.</p>
<p>Now, we dose our animals with bovine recombinant growth hormone and antibiotics by the dozen.  Yet what is the type of milk that they want to remove from our children&rsquo;s drinking?  _Whole Milk_ the version with full fat content which is the least likely to pass the stomach wall, even with homogenization/pasteurization breaking down the molecular fats.</p>
<p>And all the while, we continue to lecture to blacks to nurse their children and increase the amount of seratonins and lactose based developmental proteins &#8216;good for the brain&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>As for children and mixed-race dolls, children as young as a few months can and do imprint racial norms before they imprint other features (facial types, fat, slender etc.) and by 3-4 years this awareness is extroverted.  Why do you suppose it&rsquo;s a good idea to remove a group identity feature so deeply, genetically, ingrained ONLY from one subject population, soon to be a minority in their own homeland?</p>
<p>Our only hope is separation.  Not just from the people who form the source of our misery.  But from the government that insists their shortcomings and psychological issues become ours to be guilty over as well.</p>
<p>There is no other way to reverse the effects of ever more intrusive Federalism and if you think a souring economy is the answer, then think again about all the abusive governments (Russia, Chinese, Cambodian, Zimbabwean) whose SOLE CONTROL over the people devolved to fear of punishment as &#8216;violations of the (ever more abstruse) rules&rsquo; when they could not longer provide any of the basic services that would make their subject populations grateful enough to submit for any other reason.<br>

		<p>I have an 8 year old  niece who lives in the mostly white town of Portland, Oregon. On our last trip to India I got her some ethnic Indian female dolls dressed in saris. She was 7 then. Two days later, she had her two white friends over (unlike where I live there are very few Indian kids in her school or neighborhood).</p>
<p>She immediately hit her Indian dolls and got out her white barbies and played with them.</p>

Shouldn&rsquo;t that instead read: &ldquo;Dolls shall represent three (3) social-constructs&rdquo;?</p>
