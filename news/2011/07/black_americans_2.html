			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick J. Buchanan, Buchanan.org, July 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;The Disappearing Black Middle Class&#8221; ran the headline over the Chicago Sun-Times story. And the statistics from the Economic Policy Institute were indeed sobering.</p>
<p>In 2007, best year of the Bush era, white households had a median net worth of $134,280, compared with $13,450 for black households.</p>
<p>By 2009, the median net worth for white households had fallen 24 percent to $97,860. For black households, it had plummeted 83 percent to $2,170, a near wipeout.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One explanation for this surely is the wave of foreclosures on subprime mortgages, a large share of which were held by African-Americans.</p>
<p>But while unemployment among white men has surged in the Great Recession, among black men it has hit 16 percent, the highest level since the Department of Labor began to keep records in 1972.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not only in Wisconsin, Ohio and New Jersey, run by Republicans, is this so, but in liberal mega-states like New York and California. There, Govs. Andrew Cuomo and Jerry Brown run the show, and government payrolls are also being slashed and government pensions pared back.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Why should this adversely affect black America?</p>
<p>Because not only are African-Americans disproportionately the beneficiaries of federal programs, from the Earned Income Tax Credit to aid for education and student loans, they are even more over-represented in the federal workforce than they are on state payrolls.</p>
<p>Though 10 percent of the U.S. civilian labor force, African-Americans are 18 percent of U.S. government workers. They are 25 percent of the employees at Treasury and Veterans Affairs, 31 percent of the State Department, 37 percent of Department of Education employees and 38 percent of Housing and Urban Development. They are 42 percent of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., 55 percent of the employees at the Government Printing Office and 82 percent at the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not only are African-Americans over-represented among government employees, these jobs are the backbone of the black middle class. For federal pay and benefits have in recent years far outstripped those of the private sector.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The half-century since the Great Society was launched in the mid-1960s have been the salad days of the government sector. No segment of the population has benefited more than black America.</p>
<p>But with the U.S. government running its third deficit of 10 percent of gross domestic product, and Obama talking of cutting $4 trillion from future spending, those days are over. And as black America benefited immensely from the Great Society, so it is likely to hurt most as the cuts come.</p>
<p>Already, black voices are beginning to blame the black president whom fate has chosen to preside over the downsizing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Incredibly, the question must be asked.</p>
<p>Is this Democratic administration about to go to war with its base? Is black America souring on Barack Obama?</p>

		<p>This is a racial comedy.   Blacks will try to mau mau their dear black leader, but they can&rsquo;t play the race card on him, and he certainly doesn&rsquo;t have White guilt to atone for.</p>
<p>He is hurting the economy in general, which means blacks get hurt worse.  But he&rsquo;s not aiming to hurt the blacks.  He considers them collateral damage in his war against private property and racist White privilege.<br>

		<p>There are at least two reasons black Americans should be souring on President Obama and the Democrats:</p>
<p>1) the Democrats&rsquo; success in making low-skilled African-Americans, particularly young low-skilled african-Americans, unemployable   &mdash;  - by raising the minimum wage, and thus denying many the entry-level skills desparately need:</p>
<p>&#8220;The House yesterday overwhelmingly approved the first increase in the federal minimum wage in nearly a decade, boosting the wages of the lowest-paid American workers from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour over the next two years.&#8221; (Washington Post, Jan. 11, 2007).</p>
<p>This was on the eve the collapse of the housing bubble and the beginning of a period of prolonged high unemployment. <br>
 <br>
2) the Democrats&rsquo; success in making the hiring of African-Americans a high risk proposition by greatly increasing the probability of having to defend oneself in lawsuit if one hires and the later fires a minority (if he/she doesn&rsquo;t work out) OR if an employee of one&rsquo;s firm offends a minority (&#8220;creates a hostile work environmnent&#8221;) versus the much lower risks associated with hiring a white.</p>
<p>Even if a company wins a lawsuit connected with the termination of a minority or the quality of the work environment, the litigation costs can be steep.  The temptation is to avoid hiring an African-American altogether and thus avoid the risk.</p>

		<p>Somewhere around 35% of Blacks never finish high school.  Even those that do often have a variety of mental and behavioral problems that make it impossible to perform in a modern, complex job. However, these Blacks are quite able to work at low-skill, less mentally demanding jobs, such as some factory work, meat-packing, carpet mills, some types of construction, agriculture, janitorial, landscaping &amp; gardening, food industry, etc.  </p>
<p>Yet, it is exactly these types of low-end jobs that are being filled by millions of illegal immigrants   &mdash;   because these desperate illegals are willing to work harder for less pay, they drive down wages.  The end result is that illegals have taken all the jobs away from Blacks.  Illegal immigration is economic genocide against Blacks.  Yet, nearly all Blacks are pro-immigration.  I have never seed a stupider race. </p>

		<p>I believe African Americans will remain loyal to Barack Obama.  Perhaps slightly fewer blacks will go to the polls than in 2008, but those that vote will cast their ballots for Obama.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;By 2009, the median net worth for black households&hellip;plummeted 83 percent to $2,170&#8221;</p>
<p>The net worth of black households is only $2,170?  I find this statistic hard to believe.  If true, that is absolutely incredible.  </p>

		<p>Answer to his last question:  No.  Not where and when it matters, that is, at the ballot box November next.  He&rsquo;ll still get almost every black vote and still see a very high black turnout, just because the option is Obama or a white person.  (Sorry, Herman Cain, you&rsquo;re a joke.)

<i>Is black America souring on Barack Obama?</i></p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>I was listening to a local black talk show this afternoon and not one black caller has soured on Obama. Their wrath is focused on &#8220;The Republicans&#8221; for not recognizing what a great job he is doing and for standing in his way of doing what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Identical views can be heard daily on c-span&rsquo;s Washington Journal national call in program. </p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t grown to dislike Obama. They&rsquo;re grown to hate Republicans (Whites). </p>
<p>Buchanan and Republicans are barking up the wrong tree if they believe they can <b>reason</b> with blacks to end their support of Obama.</p>

		<p>If black opinion has turned against President Obama, it&rsquo;s because blacks perceive him as &#8220;not doing enough&#8221; for their race.  In other words, far from turning &#8220;conservative&#8221; (as those wishful-thinking Town Hall/National Review mainstream types no doubt believe), blacks are demanding that Obama turn far leftward, and with a black accent.  </p>
<p>My response:  Tough luck, homies.  Blacks are but one-eighth of the U.S. population.  That&rsquo;s what it means to be a minority group.  Your wishes are only occasionally granted.  If you want to get your wishes granted full time, move to an all-black country. </p>

		<p>Not that it was tough to envision, but I have been anticipating this day for years! Nearly the whole of the Black Middle-Class was a house built upon sand all along - it was a creation of the government and the social-engineers of various stripes. It wasn&rsquo;t created naturally, or organically, and it wasn&rsquo;t based upon merit, talent, skills and the usual tools and building-blocks of success. It was a fraud - an illusion of success, manufactured because the &#8220;powers that be&#8221; wanted to basically force blacks into success&hellip;in many ways, in spite of themselves.</p>
<p>It was doomed to fail sooner or later. All such frauds do. </p>

		<p>Almost every black who goes to the polls will vote for Obama.  It will be interesting to see, however, if he gets the massive black turnout that he did the first time.  The novelty of electing the first black Prez of course is gone, and the hoped-for reparations and other freebies have not materialized.  Whitey has not been tossed from his capitalist throne to be replaced by black masters.  Illegals are pushing blacks out of their long-time neighborhoods and taking their jobs.  The thrill certainly must be gone or at least greatly muted.  </p>

		<p>Not one word about illegals taking jobs away from Blacks.</p>
<p>In the construction trade Blacks and Whites worked use to work side by side, because construction paid good wages. Now all you see is illegals working for wages Americans can&rsquo;t afford to. Remember when Blacks took care of yards, worked in restaurants and cleaned buildings? It use to be that they could earn a living wage doing it. Not anymore. </p>

I voted for Baldwin last time, cuz criminal Nevada removed Paul from the ticket. Paul or nothing. Maybe Dr. David Duke if he&rsquo;s on there. Or I&rsquo;ll just vote third party like I normally do. Some whites I know are voting for Obama, but it&rsquo;s just because they want the country to fail faster, so that we can start over. </p>

<p>&#8220;Is black America souring on Barack Obama?</p>
<p>&#8220;The answer is no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolutely correct.  Blacks know that the community organizer is working by hook and crook to twist policies to favor blacks and the black agenda.  It&rsquo;s exactly what he has been doing most of his adult life.  He has the same agenda now he&rsquo;s always had.  The presidency just gives him more power to do more of the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buchanan and Republicans are barking up the wrong tree if they believe they can reason with blacks to end their support of Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to agree with that as well.  I just might add that they&rsquo;re barking up the wrong tree if they think they can change black thought into any direction at all that does not favor and promote blacks.</p>
<p>The black radicals, like Shabazz of the Black Panters, and the goofy Cornell West, affirmative action &#8220;professor,&#8221; issue hateful, slanderous statements about Obama, because they stupidly believe he will over react and concern himself even more so with all things black in order to regain their favor.  (Yes, they&rsquo;re that stupid.)</p>
<p>Electing this black as president has put the country in the worst social and financial position it has ever experienced.  If he&rsquo;s re-elected, it will be a complete and total disaster.</p>

		<p>#13, you may be right. I can&rsquo;t remember why, but for some reason a lot of NYC blacks became disenchanted with Dinkins and stayed home during the mayoral election of 1993, thereby helping Giuliani win. I certain that most of them wouldn&rsquo;t have voted for the white guy, Giuliani, as well.</p>

<p>There is one Wall Street firm that in order to deal with the certain threat of minority litigiousness fires entire departments when reducing employees and shifts the responsibilities to people who may or may not be familiar with them. So at this firm, a minority co-worker is a threat to non-minorities&rsquo; jobs because minorities can&rsquo;t be let go without the threat of the employer being sued by minorities (who probably weren&rsquo;t productive in the first place).</p>

<p>Among the so-called independents, however, many of whom voted for this fraud, expect them to go overwhelmingly for the Republican candidate, as long as it&rsquo;s not Romney.  If he&rsquo;s it, all bets are off.</p>

		<p>Who else are they going to vote for?  Two things: To not vote for him again is to admit their own failure in voting for him the first time. To assume they&rsquo;d admit their own mistakes is giving them too much credit.  Voting for him again is giving him the opportunity to redeem *them*, even if they don&rsquo;t really believe that he can turn it around.  To not vote for him is to prematurely kill that chance at redemption for themselves.  Second, don&rsquo;t underestimate the &#8216;chip on the shoulder&rsquo; vote, the spiteful vote. The vote that says they&rsquo;d rather have a black in office, even if he&rsquo;s doing a crap job. Also, it may seem like he&rsquo;s doing a crap job to us, but to them, to have the middle class join the ranks of the poor, it&rsquo;s a raving success. Equality not meaning pulling yourself up, but rather pulling others down to your level.</p>

I also grew up with a half black half white boy who made his way through high school. This was the late 60&rsquo;s and he got every pass there was to be had! Even then, the kids were falling all over themselves to &#8220;accept&#8221; him! They slathered him with praise for everything he did - no matter how insignificant! He was always front and center in every school activity! I believe he wound up failing at the college level and disappeared from sight! He was propped up by his peers - the same as Obama!  His legacy is the same - &#8220;I am different - but I can&rsquo;t make a difference!&#8221;</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have to &#8216;act black&rsquo;,&rsquo;talk black&rsquo;, or &#8216;think black&rsquo; -all he has to do is &#8216;look black, and he&rsquo;s got their vote. </p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t know or care what Obama actually stood for or accomplished when they voted for him in 2008, and the won&rsquo;t know or care in 2012.</p>

		<p>As much as I admire Pat Buchanan, I have to disagree with him on this issue. He is assuming way too much on the part of African-Americans (most of whom have never been to Africa and will not acknowledge America as their country). </p>
<p>As many posters have already commented, blacks vote on the basis of race (as long as the said black politician is Marxist/racialist/anti-white in his policies   &mdash;   men like Herman Cain, Alan Keyes, etc are &#8220;Uncle Toms&#8221; and not really brothas). </p>
<p>I had this confirmed to me by a black college student in my writing class, who explained to me that she would vote for Obama because she felt, among other reasons, that it&rsquo;s &#8220;our turn&#8221; to have power and that Obama &#8220;looks like me.&#8221;  In other words, she didn&rsquo;t care about any real-world issues   &mdash;   she was voting for a man simply because he was black. </p>
<p>Blacks will stick with their afrocentric thinking no matter what happens and no matter how badly Obama uses the executive branch to accelerate America&rsquo;s decline. The alternative would be to vote for a white man (or woman)   &mdash;   and that they won&rsquo;t do. </p>
<p>Just look at Robert Mugabe for a parallel. He is destroying his own people with his despotism yet he uses their hatred of whites to maintain his abominable power. Black hatred of whites is no different here in the USA. In their envy of white America, they would rather help bring the whole country down even further rather than betray their race. </p>

		<p>Thats the main question.</p>
<p>Is it worth going down in life rather than up just to have a black or half black president? </p>
<p>But we know when the rubber hits the road in the voting booth there aint no chance in hell they will vote for anyone other than their &#8220;boy&#8221; come hell or high water. </p>
<p>Otherwise they would be voting in whites in all the big delapidated 3rd world Afri-Mex big cities of America where crime drugs death poverty is 2nd nature. </p>
<p>They will always prefer Africa in America as opposed to America in America. </p>
<p>They are self destructive in nature aka inferior genetics..</p>

		<p>Blacks vote for blacks. Mexicans and other nonwhites will ALWAYS vote for the nonwhite. This is what we reap when we allowed nonwhite immigration to begin with. The black slaves were never meant to be freed upon White America. Our enemies within did that. The founders never meant for blacks to become citizens let alone be able to vote. They never meant for any sort of nonwhite 3rd world immigration into this land and we all know it, yet we still allow it to keep on going until we have become the minority in our own land. </p>
<p>So what do we expect our own government to become? A government of Whites for Whites? Face it, we have lost our own country because of our cowardice and apathy. We can sit and complain all day long but most Whites have caved and love their &#8220;masters&#8221;. We have become the tail and they the head. The White race seems to have a huge genetic flaw in this area. They truly believe they are &#8220;moral&#8221; by giving up their own to others. How can a race of people be so blind?  Pathetic.</p>

		<p>One thing that was (once again) made very clear during the Casey Anthony trial is that in the black world color trumps everything. As witnessed by the white outrage at the verdict, whites will come down on their own in droves when a white does something despicible and perverse, but blacks will defend to the death anyone the same color regardless of the &#8216;content of their character&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Barry O and his Amazonian white-hating Mrs. will stay right where they are until 2016. The thought makes me nauseous, and I would SO love to be wrong.</p>

		<p>Blacks are not motivated by self-interest or even racial solidarity.</p>
<p>They are motivated by genocidal hate against whites.</p>
<p>In other words, they vote for Obama not because they expect anything from him nor because he is black.  They vote for him because he is finishing up the conversion of the US into an anti-white totalitarian state.</p>

		<p>I think FAR FEWER blacks will turn out to support Obama.  To keep black support Obama would have to (on video) literally pull a gun on Donald Trump, take his wallet and jack his limo.  Then Obama would look into the camera and say, &#8220;takin&rsquo; from the man and givin&rsquo; it ta ya&rsquo;ll&#8221;&hellip; to keep the black masses happy.  </p>
<p>Blacks have done no better under Obama and they have lost interest in him.  </p>

		<p>The statistics Pat lists in the article are incredible. I knew that the illegal immigrant/minority housing meltdown was bad&hellip;but $2,170? Wow.</p>
<p>I agree with most of the posters that blacks certainly will NOT sour on Obama and nearly 100% will vote for him again in 2012. The simply either don&rsquo;t understand or refuse to believe what he is doing to the country and like last time will vote for him because he&rsquo;s black even though he is destroying black America. </p>
<p>In some respects it&rsquo;s the same way ignorant whites continue to vote for liberals who are destroying white America via massive immigration.</p>

I think this idea that its consequential at all whether Obama wins or loses is absolutely farcical.  Aside from a few tangential issues Obama isn&rsquo;t all that different from Bush.  He&rsquo;s continued the wars,he&rsquo;s even expanded them and even added another one in Libya.  Obama has allowed the bankers on Wall Street to continue run riot and continue looting the economy.  If there&rsquo;s any lobby he&rsquo;s beholden it&rsquo;s certainly the bankers above all else.  All the economic and political policies that the have left vilified under Bush have continued with nary an interruption.  The difference between a possible Republican President and Obama will be about as substantive as the difference between vanilla and lemon coca cola.  Yes both flavors are different and both flavors will have their respective supporters and detractors but at the end of the its still coke.<br>

<p>Wrong. Wrong Wrong. </p>
<p>99% is wrong. 99.9% is wrong. 99.999999% is wrong. </p>
<p>He got 100% in 2008. He will get 100% in 2012. </p>
<p>Stupid stupid stupid whites. No wonder you are in such a pickle. You are always dreaming in some fantazy world. Same for Nero who fiddled while Rome burned. </p>
<p>One thing you can say for blacks is they dont play around. They are solid and nothing can penetrate their defense. Nothing. </p>
<p>Whites can learn a lesson from blacks. Solidify 100%. Its the only way to avoid extinction and make no mistake that this is your fate unless you take immediate action. This is no fantazy.</p>

		<p>Of course blacks will vote for him again in 2012. They would vote for him again in 2016 if he could run again. Blacks voting for Obama are not our problem. Skin color trumps all with blacks. Always has and always will. I wish our white race was more like that.</p>
<p>In any event, the problem for us is the brain-dead liberals and self-hating whites that will continue to support Obama to our detriment. This is still his base and he knows that. </p>
<p>In an effort to expand his base, he has shamelessly continued to pander to Hispanics - specifically illegal invading Hispanics - knowing full well they will vote; especially when the amnesty carrot continues to be dangled in front of their faces.</p>
<p>The irony is that Hispanics hate blacks and would not give Obama the time of day if it were not for his commitment to passing amnesty and a shared hatred for YT.<br>

		<p>Look folks, it matters little what blacks do. They are hopelessly an irrevocably racist. Our future is in the hands of insane white liberals. The whites at MSNBC or the SPLC love them in spite of the conspicuous threat to our quality of life. Look how they savage Sarah Palin! Liberalism is indeed a mental disorder.</p>

		<p>&#8220;By 2009, the median net worth for white households had fallen 24 percent to $97,860. For black households, it had plummeted 83 percent to $2,170, a near wipeout.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is impossible.  A 10 year old car is worth more than $2,170.<br>
Buchanan probably counted only real estate ownership as net worth.</p>
