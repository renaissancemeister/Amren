<h1>State to Fight Ruling Against Ban on Race in College Admissions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Chambers et al., Detroit News, July 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said today he will appeal a court ruling that overturned the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which bans the use of race and gender preferences in college admissions and government hiring and contracting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;MCRI embodies the fundamental premise of what America is all about: equal opportunity under the law,&#8221; Schuette said in a statement. &#8220;Entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit, and I will continue the fight for equality, fairness and rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>A federal appeals court today overturned Proposal 2, saying the voter-approved measure harms minorities and is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The 2006 law forced the University of Michigan and other state schools to revise their admission policies. In a 2-1 decision, the judges ruled that the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>

		<p>This is all smoke and mirrors anymore. The time has past for legalities. The lawyers had their chance and loused it up. The die is cast now and this will all be settled on a completely different venue than courtrooms.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Michigan&rsquo;s Attorney General: &ldquo;I will continue the fight for equality, fairness and rule of law.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the words of a fool who is so brainwashed and indoctrinated he can&rsquo;t even recognize that he&rsquo;s fighting against fairness, equality and the rule of law.</p>
<p>The American empire is slowly sinking in the West.</p>

		<p>Knocking on wood here   &mdash;   Michigan&rsquo;s new Attorney General is continuing Mike Cox&rsquo;s policy.  Cox was the only Michigan statewide elected official of either party to support MCRI in 2006, and it won and he won too on an otherwise bad day for Republicans in the state.  </p>

		<p>From the article: <i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a great victory. It means affirmative action is legal again in college admissions. It means that thousands of talented black, Latino and Native Americans can go to our public universities,&#8221; Washington said.</i></p>
<p>What utter rot.  Those black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants who are genuinely talented will get in <i>without</i> affirmative action.  The ones who need affirmative action are the ones who aren&rsquo;t talented.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading Cole&rsquo;s opinion.  He claims that U of M&rsquo;s admissions policy was designed to benefit minorities.  Which is funny because university attorneys did NOT make that argument before the Supreme Court.  Instead, they argued that they needed &#8220;diversity&#8221; because it was supposedly good for everyone.</p>

		<p>Be careful. Be very careful. To Blacks &#8220;merit&#8221; or &#8220;qualified&#8221; means BLACK. </p>
<p>I noticed this awhile back. While listening to Black academics defend Affirmative Action, they were saying being black was a reason to be admitted or given special treatment. Being BLACK itself made you &#8220;qualified&#8221;. Clever, huh.</p>
<p>For the Judges: How can NOT using race hurt anybody unless race means there is a difference? If Affirmative Action is needed, and it is to benefit particular races, then you are admitting there is such a difference between the races that we need Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>If we are equal, we don&rsquo;t need it. If we need it, we are not equal. Is it just me or am I smarter than these judges?</p>
<p>How do you argue for different treatment for different races when you are trying to defend equality? </p>
<p>As for the law? What stinkin&rsquo; law. Blacks don&rsquo;t give a damn about laws, Never have. Never will. They want POWER. They want revenge (Jefferson warned us). They will never, ever obey the &#8220;law&#8221; since law is a white man&rsquo;s concept.</p>
<p>Read all these reports about gangs of blacks attacking people on the street. Isn&rsquo;t there a law about this? Hmmmmm. </p>

		<p>Equal opportunity was a proud feature of the formerly great USA. But equal outcomes has taken over so the future is bleak. You can&rsquo;t trust any non-white professional anymore because you know they had lower standards to meet. You&rsquo;d think that blacks would be offended and ashamed that they can&rsquo;t meet higher standards. But they&rsquo;re not - which confirms their lack of character.<br>
