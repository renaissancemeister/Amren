			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lee Moran, Daily Mail (London), July 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An essay written by the &#8216;mother of the civil rights movement&rsquo; saying how she was nearly raped while working for a white neighbour is set to be auctioned.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks penned the harrowing six-page memoir about her experience as a housekeeper many years after the 1931 incident.</p>
<p>It is among thousands of her personal items up for sale that are predicted to fetch at least $8 million.</p>
<p>Parks wrote: &#8216;He offered me a drink of whiskey, which I promptly and vehemently refused. He moved nearer to me and put his hand on my waist. I was very frightened by now.</p>
<p>&#8216;He liked me. He didn&rsquo;t want me to be lonely and would I be sweet to him. He had money to give me for accepting his attentions. I was ready to die, but give my consent never. Never, never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The essay, written in her own hand, is to be sold by New York auction house Guernsey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Civil rights historian Danielle McGuire said she had never before heard of the attempted rape of Parks and called the find &#8216;astounding&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And she believes it could help explain what triggered Parks&rsquo; lifelong campaign against the ritualistic rape of black women by white men.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;I thought it was because of the stories that she had heard. But this gives a much more personal context to that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Black, middle-aged seamstress Parks is credited with inspiring the civil rights movement after refusing to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955.</p>
<p>It led to the Supreme Court outlawing segregation on buses.</p>
<p>She received the nation&rsquo;s two highest honours in her lifetime, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor.</p>
<p>She died, aged 92, in 2005  &mdash;  leaving a treasure trove of personal correspondence, papers relating to her work for the Montgomery branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and tributes from presidents and world leaders.</p>
<p>Manhattan&rsquo;s Guernsey&rsquo;s Auctioneers has been chosen by a Michigan court to find an institution to buy and preserve the complete archive which contains more than 8,000 items.</p>
<p>Guernsey&rsquo;s president Arlan Ettinger said Parks&rsquo; personal papers revealed a woman who spent a lifetime fighting for racial equality and against the sexual violence of black women.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;It is wonderful and breathtaking. It will be up to the institution that ends up with it to make this material known to the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale will go to resolve a dispute over her estate, divided between her relatives and the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development that she created in 1987.</p>
<p>Guernsey&rsquo;s, known for its sale of iconic and celebrity collections, took an inventory of Parks&rsquo; homes in Detroit soon after she died and is looking for an institution to buy her archive, which Ettinger described as the most complete he&rsquo;s ever seen.</p>
<p>The only thing missing, he quipped, was the bus itself, which is in fact called The Henry Ford and resides in a museum in Dearborn, Michigan.</p>
<p>He said that Guernsey&rsquo;s had talked to 20 museums, libraries, university and churches about buying the archive, valued between $8 million to $10 million, over the past three years.</p>
<p>But he added: &#8216;There hasn&rsquo;t been a group that didn&rsquo;t desperately want it but had to face the reality whether they could afford it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, a research library of the New York Public Library, was among those interested.</p>
<p>Its new director, Khalil Gibran Muhammad, said the centre had very little material on Parks and would love to own some of her papers.</p>
<p>But it proved impossible because the archive is being sold as a single collection.</p>
<p>Muhammad said: &#8216;She is a witness to the beginning and the maturation of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>&#8216;She walked as close to Martin Luther King Jr as you can get at the beginning of the movement.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Another fantasy conjured up as a Apologia for the 30,000 White women raped   every year by Blacks just in the US alone.</p>
<p>Parks was put up to the whole thing by the King Clan. She was an operative just as was King. </p>
<p>I guess we could use Pearl Harbor or the Bataan Death March as an excuse for murdering innocent Japanese tourists in our cities today.<br>
It&rsquo;s important that they continue to fuel the fire of anti-White sentiment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not excusing the actions of the man by offering her money for sex isn&rsquo;t rape but rather solicitation for prostitution. </p>

		<p>Along with all the other absurd lies and twists of truth, the liberals have this one  &mdash;  that anytime sex occurred between a white man and black woman (before the civil rights revolution) it was a result of rape, plain and simple.  The white man could have been a field worker and the black woman a society heiress, but it was still rape.  The two could have had a loving marriage that lasted 75 years, but  &mdash;  well, you know.  <br>
If black women in the South were so helpless, then how was Parks able to dissuade her so-called potential rapist?  And, gee, this is the first time I ever heard of a would-be rapist offering a victim money!  </p>

		<p>Oh yea she was nearly raped by a white neighbor, like I believe that.<br>
When he threw a bucket of cold water on her when he caught her trying to steal melons out of his garden, that is NOT called attempted rape. I would say she was a liar and a trouble maker, nothing else.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible Ms. Parks was brave enough to admit she was raped, but not quite brave enough to admit the perp was noble, victim, black man. There was a time when a white youth might rape a black girl, though. But rape across the color line likely occurred many times more often in the other direction, even then too. I believe today any given black man is 1,600 times more likely to rape a white woman than the other way around? 20,000 white women are raped by a black man each year, while around 40 cases of the reverse take place? And there are a lot more &#8216;oppressor&rsquo; white men within the population. Don&rsquo;t expect reality to interfere with a good story, let alone a legend making process. </p>

<p>Yeah, all 10 of them every year, if that. If she was alive today, I wounder what she would think of the roughly 40,000 rapes per year that her brothers commit every year against White women? </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;&lsquo;He liked me. He didn&rsquo;t want me to be lonely and would I be sweet to him. He had money to give me for accepting his attentions. I was ready to die, but give my consent never. Never, never.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesnt sound like an attempted rape to me, but rather a proposition. There is probably no way to confirm or deny this story, but I have my doubts about its validity. A White man with money making a proposition to a black woman? The MYTH that White men find black women sexually desirable seems to be pretty prevalent in the black community. I have never known a White man who was attracted to black women (and I know a lot of people), though there obviously are some. I count this NON attraction to black women as ONE reason that the White on black rape rate is extremely low. Also, given the black propensity for making up stories of White&rsquo;s wronging them, would cast an even broader shadow on this story. </p>
<p>Regadless, expect the media to make hay with this story as a way to cast blacks even further into victimhood at the hands of the evil White man. <br>

		<p>This is a good example of the Anti-White Narrative which is characterized by cherry-picking personal anecdotes long after their truth can be tested, and ignoring identical examples with the demographics reversed.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the campaign of defamation with which we are faced every day by the dominant media culture and the corporate entertainment culture.  Fight back.  See:  <a href="https://www.resistingdefamation.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.resistingdefamation.org/</a></p>

		<p> &#8220;Almost&#8221; only counts with horseshoes and hand grenades.</p>
<p> How does anyone know, at this date 80 years later, whether this &#8220;essay&#8221; describes a true incident, or was ginned up by some civil rights &#8220;advisor&#8221; to Parks, or perhaps was describing a figment of Parks&rsquo; own imagination?</p>
<p> But, nevertheless, the beatification of Rosa Parks goes on apace among black militants and White liberals. Look for a proposal for a monument to her on the Washington Mall (presumably sitting down in the front of the bus). That is, unless they&rsquo;ve put one up already, since the Mulatto Messiah took over the Oval Office.</p>

<p>I have never heard of an attempted rape wherein money was offered. At best it could be called an unwanted sexual advance. But leave it to the liberal media machine to weave into the desired propaganda wherein the whites are the evil devils and the blacks are the courageous victims.</p>
<p>There are plenty of non-black women walking around these days who can clearly define rape and attempted rape. And &#8220;ritualisticly&#8221; the aggressor is almost always black.</p>

<p>*And she believes it could help explain what triggered Parks&rsquo; lifelong campaign against the ritualistic rape of black women by white men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ritualistic rape of black women by White men&#8221; - are you serious? And just WHERE is this happening? </p>

		<p>I believe her, simply because things like this have happened to every woman since we became humans except for those who either entered convents at age 12 or grew up in their Father&rsquo;s harems and then went to their husband&rsquo;s harems.</p>
<p>Even the most militant anti rape feminazi District attorney however, would not consider what happened attempted rape. Since he stopped after she told him no it does not even fit the legal definition of sexual harassment</p>
<p>According to this account he did not even touch her.  He did not stand in the door of a room with only one door to prevent her leaving the room.  He did not expose himself.</p>
<p>According to the account, this was nothing more than a sexual approach.  Sexual approaches range from enjoyable flirtations the woman welcomes to totally unwelcome and sometimes frightening sexual harassment. </p>
<p>Feminazis say the difference between an acceptable flirtatious approach and sexual harassment is how the woman feels about what the man said, not what the man actually said.</p>
<p>That is certainly true of me.  For years it was impossible for me to be out in public without some lecherous creep trying to chat me up.  My reaction depended on whatever mood I was in that day.  If I was already out of sorts I would just open my mouth and start screaming because of some innocuous pick up line.</p>
<p>We can be sure that if he had done anything more than try to get her drunk and begged for sex she would have written more about it.  Touching her would have turned into tearing off her clothes and throwing he down on her bed.</p>
<p>So her employer came on to her.  Men are men and she was a woman.</p>
<p>At least he did not report her to her employer and try to get her fired for racism because she turned him down as black men do when they get turned down by White women with whom they work.</p>
<p>I am White. I have had literally thousands of sexual approaches by black men in my life.  Some were polite.  Some were obnoxious.  A few grabbed my arm.  Many tried to lure me into their cars.  None of these events could possibly be construed even by an extreme White nationalist as myself as attempted rape. </p>

<p>Where the hell did that come from?  Yes like the Duke boys raped the black stripper, and white cops raped Tawana Brawley, and add the black guy in To Kill a Mockingbird to the list of black fantasy suffering at the hands of white people. </p>
<p>More realistic is the ritualistic fantasy of black women wishing to have sex with a white man.</p>

		<p>A)In the US in a typical year, 10s of thousands of white women are raped by black men whereas less than 10 black women are raped by white men, despite the fact that there are ~5x as many white men. In fact, there is an even larger disparity in the number of potential white men vs black because 1) many hispanic men when they commit crimes are counted as white, 2) a much higher % of black men than white men are behind bars and unable to attack women. </p>
<p>B) Virtually every public rape claim of white men raping black women in living memory have been proven later to be false.</p>
<p>C) Either Ms. Parks and/or her enablers in the mainstream media, black rights groups, and academia have falsified and/or hidden aspects of her past and behaviors for political reasons. </p>
<p>In short, I&rsquo;d take all of this with a giant grain of salt.</p>

		<p>Bold of them to report on what &#8220;appears&#8221; to have happened in 1931.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s happening now.</p>
<p>Based on US government stats from 2005 (PDF available here:  https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf) over a third of the verified 111,490 rapes and sexual assaults on white women that year were committed by blacks, leading to a total estimated number of black-on-white victims at 37,460.</p>
<p>By contrast, black victims of white sexual predators were listed at 0.0%. Scanning these government stats from 2003 to 2008, I counted 135,207 rapes and sexual assaults perpetrated by blacks against whites and ZERO committed by whites against blacks.</p>
<p>For the year 2006, Wikipedia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rape in the United States&rdquo; entry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_the_United_States) cites statistics that work out to roughly 32,443 black-on-white sexual assaults compared to &ldquo;a negligible number of white offenders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It comes from movies like Mandingo and Drum where leftists directors portrayed the American south as some kind of an interracial club med.</p>
<p>This was probably cooked by the same American Communist Party members who orchestrated her famous famous bus sitting performance.</p>

<p>This is an attempted rape? Saying he liked her. He didn&rsquo;t want her to be lonely? He thought she would be sweet to him? Offering money?</p>
<p>If true, the man was trying to seduce her, not rape her. At no point did he attempt to force her and when he was rebuffed, he accepted that <b>NO MEANS NO.</b> This alleged &#8220;rapist&#8221; was decades ahead of the learning curve.  </p>
<p>Remember when feminists told us that rape was an act of violence? Now rape consists of looking a woman without her consent.</p>
<p>Notice how much is extrapolated from these alleged events and all without proof?</p>
<p>We are witnesses to the birth of a new myth. <br>

		<p>A few unrelated observations.</p>
<p>I attended the University where the author of the book teachers.<br>
The drop out rate of black males is 90%.  It is a leftist anti-America institution. </p>
<p>Most white men do not find black women attractive so they don&rsquo;t date or rape them.  </p>
<p>Black men believe that black women straighten their hair to please white men and it angers them. </p>
<p>Black women who have babies fathered by white men are extremely proud of their mixed race kids.  </p>
<p>I think Rosa Parks must have had too much cough medicine when she wrote her &#8220;rape&#8221; story.  </p>

		<p>The comments here are great! I don&rsquo;t have much to add except that people here need to start ACTING (just like Rosa Parks and King). I think that most people here just sit and scribble to get things off of their chest and do nothing more. <br>
This site is called &#8220;American RENAISSANCE&#8221; and renaissance means &#8220;re-birth&#8221;. What is it that you people are giving birth to? Join a white separatist group and start acting! <br>

		<p>&#8220;By contrast, black victims of white sexual predators were listed at 0.0%. Scanning these government stats from 2003 to 2008, I counted 135,207 rapes and sexual assaults perpetrated by blacks against whites and ZERO committed by whites against blacks&#8221;.</p>
<p>These &#8216;multiple attacker&rsquo; rapes are almost always committed by men of color. As are the assaults and mob beatings too, actually.<br>

		<p>I wonder if Ms. Parks is aware that far more white MEN are raped in a given year by black men compared to the number of black women raped by white men. It&rsquo;s a common but taboo phenomenon. Read Amnesty International&rsquo;s &#8220;No Escape: Male Rape in US Prisons,&#8221; by Joan Mariner. Then read T.J. Parcell&rsquo;s &#8220;Fish: A Memoir of a Boy in a Man&rsquo;s Prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, when I was in the Army and transferred to my final duty station, a white soldier was in the process of pursuing UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice) against his black First Sergeant and an accomplice who had raped him in Iraq. Yes, our post-integration military is not quite a &#8220;band of brothers&#8221; as any white Vietnam vet can attest.</p>

		<p>I wonder why we can&rsquo;t ever get concrete statistics on subjects like this. Clearly, between 20,000 and 40,000 white women are raped by most black men every year (most of these incidents taking place in some phase of the penal system), yet there are no consequences as the majority of these incidents go unreported. With this many incidents every year for 400+ years, one wonders when this persecution of white women by black men will finally be reported in the media.</p>

		<p>What complete nonsense.</p>
<p>How could the writer come up with &#8220;she was nearly raped while working for a white neighbour&#8221; based on nothing? If you read just the headline you&rsquo;d come away with the entirely wrong impression. Oh, I see, that was the idea.</p>
<p>And hey, if blacks are always screaming that race doesn&rsquo;t matter in crime stories, why add &#8220;white neighbour&#8221; in the first place?</p>
<p>If you read the piece it&rsquo;s like saying &#8220;Rosa very nearly became a multi-millionaire because she bought a Powerball ticket at the gas station.&#8221; </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even believe the benign little account she supposedly &#8220;penned.&#8221; Parks was a low-life stooge and puppet for black apologists and was set up to bring the court case - there was no spontaneous &#8220;civil rights&#8221; rebellion on her part.</p>
<p>This is even worse: &#8220;And she believes it could help explain what triggered Parks&rsquo; lifelong campaign against the ritualistic rape of black women by white men.&#8221; </p>
<p>From what kind of a delusional, alternate universe did that sentence appear? I thought Parks was a bus-riding plaintiff. Now she&rsquo;s suddenly an advocate campaigning against an issue that doesn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>Lastly, she&rsquo;s some icon, isn&rsquo;t she? What&rsquo;s the deal auctioning off her all her trinkets, bling, and bogus awards for $8 million? How classless can you get? </p>
<p>Then I read this - here&rsquo;s the opening snippet from a related story linked to the original article&hellip;how typical:</p>
<p>The Estate of Civil Rights Pioneer Rosa Parks Drained, Claims Lawyer<br>
 By Daily Mail Reporter</p>
<p>It has been only six years since she died having cemented her place in history but already the estate of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks is being contested by relatives, friends and lawyers.</p>
<p>A lawyer involved in a long-running dispute over her estate claims two other lawyers piled up fees that ate away about two-thirds of the estate&rsquo;s $372,000 cash value.</p>

		<p>There is no reason to believe that the incident Parks describes ever happened. Those associated with her estate say they believe it is a work of fiction. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we won&rsquo;t be hearing about the &#8216;attempted rape&rsquo; of Parks by a perfidious white man for years and years and years&hellip; </p>
<blockquote>
Steven G. Cohen, a lawyer for the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development in Detroit, said people who knew Parks well were aware she liked to write fictional essays. Parks&rsquo;s friend of 45 years, Elaine Steele, never heard Parks speak of the encounter and was not aware of the document, Cohen said.
<p>&ldquo;This six-page essay we believe is a work of fiction,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Cohen. &ldquo;We believe that Mrs. Parks meant for the story to be private.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br>

What do you mean, she was &#8220;raped&#8221;? Did you read the story?   It&rsquo;s quite clear, by her own description,  that no rape occurred. Offering her a drink, even putting his hand on her waist, does  not constitute &#8220;rape&#8221;!</p>
<p>And evidently when she said &#8220;no&#8221;, he took her at her word and that was the end of that.  Did he attack her?  No!  Did she fight him off?  No! So where was the &#8220;rape&#8221;?  (And where was her &#8220;bravery&#8221; either, for that matter?  So she turned down the drink and the money.  Big deal.  Is this a historical incident that we need to be reading about?)<br>

<p>Based on US government stats from 2005 (PDF available here: https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf) over a third of the verified 111,490 rapes and sexual assaults on white women that year were committed by blacks, leading to a total estimated number of black-on-white victims at 37,460.&#8221;</p>

<p>Can ANYONE imagine that if it were a white woman, and the advancer was a black guy, that he would have listened to the woman and went away?  This is a manufactured story here, designed to up the price of Rosa Park&rsquo;s personal artifacts, which are currently up for sale to museums for 3-7 million. </p>

<p>I came of age in the south at the edge of the Jim Crow era.  As a young white man I worked a lot of blue collar jobs when I got out of school.  My associates were &#8220;salt of the earth&#8221; white guys and the conversations always and inevitably centered on sex.</p>
<p>The priority for sexual companionship among them was: 1. white girls, 2. pretty Hispanics, 3. petite Orientals.  Black women only entered the conversation when discussing a unique and exaggerated black female body component; or, as providers of sexual favors of last resort for a dollar cost when all else failed. </p>
<p>The thought of rape in general was abhorrent to these fellows and the rape of a black woman by a white man was so off the table it was never discussed.       </p>

<p>I used to be young and crisp, too, and yes, I have had offers. Not of money though. Nothing unusual there.   And while I am at it,  I lived fairly close to a US military installation overseas in the sixties,  and I have been approached by a couple of black soldiers, sitting down on the tram next to me, for instance.  You turn down their advances and they want to argue the point and insist it is because they are black.  I am sure a lot of white girls have fallen into this trap, to prove they are not racist. <br>

<p>YES!  Most here are not looking at the underlying agenda:  Who is lying about and promoting this &#8220;incident&#8221; as a &#8220;rape?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosa Parks was an <i>agent provocateur</i> and sock puppet.  It is the evil MEDIA that is promoting this ludicrous story as a &#8220;rape.&#8221;   If the media were doing its job and weren&rsquo;t anti-white THEY would be NOT publish this story as a &#8220;harrowing&#8221;, &#8220;ready to die&#8221; tale of &#8220;near&#8221; rape, but rather would laugh at her description of this incident as being a rape, along with printing FBI/DOJ data about the true number of daily  black-on-white rapes.</p>
<p>This article is NOT to promote Rosa Parks; it is to debase and demean whites.  THIS was the primary goal of the article, and is THE primary goal of the media.</p>
<p>And, where our attention should be focused:  WHO is doing this to us?<br>

		<p>Rosa Parks was not in danger of being raped. She was in danger of being fired by her employer if she refused his advances. Fortunately, this does not seem to have happened.<br>
 <br>
In &#8220;Black Like Me,&#8221; the author, John Howard Griffin, describes a conversation with a white employer of black women who bragged about having sex with them. It has been decades since I read the book, but I doubt it was consensual. <br>
 <br>
Most American blacks have some white ancestry. For the most part this is not because of the actions of black rapists, but white slave owners and employers who used their economic power over black women. <br>
 <br>
At times the liaisons were consensual, like the affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings seems to have been. More frequently they were not. </p>

		<p>In my 6:50 pm post (Post #5) on this thread, I write that there are roughly 40,000 black on White rapes per year in the US. There are 2 other posts above mine using other numbers. I always use the number 40,000 regarding black on White rapes, when I comment on other websites (and yes I get branded as a racist for doing so) and I would like to point out why. The official number is approximately 37,500 per year and of course that number will vary year to year. </p>
<p>However this is ONLY single offender rapes. One black rapist and one White victim. That number doesn&rsquo;t include the many black on White gang rapes. A few years back, I calculated the number of black males that would be involved in gang rapes, given the official number of total black on White gang rapes. And I used a conservative number of blacks per gang rape. This is how I came up with the extra blacks and arrived at the APPROXIMATELY 40,000 number. But now I cant even find the stats for the number of gang rapes per year in the US. It APPEARS as though google is playing hide the data again.</p>

<p>First of all, what she described - if true - was not a rape but a man coming on to her. </p>
<p>Second of all, there are no rapes of black women by white men. But there are over 30,000 cases each year of black men raping white women.</p>

		<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to preface this by saying that as a white male, I don&rsquo;t find the vast majority of black women attractive in the least. I have seen a few in my life, but overall, Shaneeka and Monique just don&rsquo;t do it for me. I&rsquo;d live a celibate life if they were my only choice. <br>
That being said, from the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of Rosa Parks (her fraudulent background notwithstanding) she appeared to be a rather light skinned black woman; and although most pics show her in advanced age, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that she wasn&rsquo;t fairly attractive as a young woman. This is not to condone some fool offering to pay her for sex, but whether it happened or not, the left will use anything, no matter how specious or exaggerated to uplift the myth of this woman. But if a white guy putting his arm around her and suggesting something were the extent of what transpired, then she must&rsquo;ve been emotionally immature, naive, young or all three. Most women who are even moderately attractive are going to be &#8220;hit on&#8221; (and that&rsquo;s what this looks like) in their lives; most shrug it off and walk away or smile when they&rsquo;re doing it. Civil rights icons put it in their diaries. </p>

		<p>What a vague story and the &#8220;experts&#8221; (in the article I read on Yahoo News) seem unable to agree on if it is fact or fiction. One person claimed that Park&rsquo;s enjoyed writing fiction. The article makes sure to point out that the &#8220;suspect&#8221; was white. I found that interesting related to the omission of Park&rsquo;s more recent (1994) and truly harrowing victimization by a man in Detroit. The description in the article appears to be little more than an intoxicated man making sexual/romantic advances on a female employee. Maybe not completely appropriate but has anyone related to this story been to a bar or night club before? The auction house is probably just trying to get the property in the news again to increase bids. <br>

<p>Bold of them to report on what &ldquo;appears&rdquo; to have happened in 1931.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about what&rsquo;s happening now.</p>
<p>Based on US government stats from 2005 (PDF available here: https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvus05.pdf) over a third of the verified 111,490 rapes and sexual assaults on white women that year were committed by blacks, leading to a total estimated number of black-on-white victims at 37,460.</p>
<p>But how much faith can really be put in these DOJ stats? If the Fabians currently in charge of national discourse got a look at them they would faint in heaps. Are you certain there is not some jiggery-pokery going on with those DOJ figures? They seem too glaring.</p>

		<p>In 1960 I was a first-year student at U.Va., and one night on our dorm floor we were out in the hall discussing whether we would have sex with a black woman or not (for the majority of us at that time, having sex with any woman was highly hypothetical).</p>
<p>Our upper-classman floor counselor from Charleston, S. Carolina wandered by and offered that he would never think of doing such a thing. I asked him why, and without any tone of disparagement in his voice he replied simply, &#8220;Because they&rsquo;re (the polite word for blacks at that time).&#8221;</p>
<p>That was back when white folks had some plain common sense.</p>

		<p>In re Taurus689:</p>
<p>I read those statistics on several sites. One of them, David Duke&rsquo;s maybe, posted a reproduction of the Government statistics. </p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to interpret what I saw, so I called the Department of Justice and spoke to two very helpful people.  They said that the 37,460 rapes were a legitimate EXTRAPOLATION of the statistics, but since rape is a relatively rare crime, the basis for the extrapolation was small.</p>
<p>I told the editor of the local paper about it and, at first, he didn&rsquo;t respond to my messages.  Finally, he called with great hostility, and told me I was wrong.  When I asked what he thought the correct number of black on white rapes was, he hung up. </p>
<p>This is the same man whose paper made a big story out of a black high school football player&rsquo;s claiming he&rsquo;d been called the &#8220;N-word&#8221; during a local game when others had not heard it.  </p>

		<p>A very common racial epithet used by African Americans is &#8220;honky.&#8221; Did you ever wonder where the word came from? This is the etymology of honky: In the pre 1950s South there were very few economic opportunities for black women; they were maids, laundresses and cotton pickers if they had any employment at all. So it is an unfortunate but entirely true fact of history that prostitution played a significant role in the black economy. White johns on the look-out for sexual release would drive down to the black districts and honk their horns at the black women to get their attention (whether they were street walkers or not, I suppose). Honky means honker.<br>
    In Africa sexual relations are very free and easy. This is why STDs are rampant in the Sub-Saharan countries. When roads were built truckers picked up hitch hiking women and as the price of a 10 mile journey these women freely and naturally came across. Thus mile by mile AIDS conquered Africa. <br>

Mr.Engleman:</p>
<p><br>
You are correct. In fact, given theracial and sexual dynamics  of the time period, I do believe this story.  The fact is that too many of our AMREN posters refuse to acknowledge that there have been and are still many Whites who do engage in interracial sexual liaisons and miscegenation they would like to admit. Hell, some of the posters on this board have admitted to having sex with non-Whites and in some cases having non-White children!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why for the life of me that this is so hard for some of you to comprehend or admit to. If you are a RACE REALIST and that is that what this site is, then you would understand the fact that such incidents have been a part of American history. Living in denial does none of us any good.  <br>

Pictures of Rosa Parks when she was in her twenties show that she was a very attractive woman. At least for a Black woman she was.  Secondly, he may have been a fat, ugly man, so what? If he was White, then Rosa Parks was telling the truth.</p>

First, I&rsquo;d like to preface this by saying that as a white male, I don&rsquo;t find the vast majority of black women attractive in the least. I have seen a few in my life, but overall, Shaneeka and Monique just don&rsquo;t do it for me. I&rsquo;d live a celibate life if they were my only choice. <br>
That being said, from the pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of Rosa Parks (her fraudulent background notwithstanding) she appeared to be a rather light skinned black woman; and although most pics show her in advanced age, it&rsquo;s not hard to imagine that she wasn&rsquo;t fairly attractive as a young woman. This is not to condone some fool offering to pay her for sex, but whether it happened or not, the left will use anything, no matter how specious or exaggerated to uplift the myth of this woman. But if a white guy putting his arm around her and suggesting something were the extent of what transpired, then she must&rsquo;ve been emotionally immature, naive, young or all three. Most women who are even moderately attractive are going to be &ldquo;hit on&rdquo; (and that&rsquo;s what this looks like) in their lives; most shrug it off and walk away or smile when they&rsquo;re doing it. Civil rights icons put it in their diaries</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Your psot is very intuitive and thoguhtful. In fact, pictures of her that I have seen do demonstrate that she was a very attractive light skinned Black woman. That being said it would not surprised me that a man of any race would have tried to tke advantage of her.</p>

<p>This is one version. Another version is blacks mispronouncing the perjorative term for an eastern European, a bohunk [hunkey], short for bohemian. A hunkey became honkey, black folks unable to pronounce the word &#8220;northern&#8221; style.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings<br>
A New American Myth!<br>
By Patricia C. Crouch</p>
<p>                I am a lineal descendant of Thomas Jefferson, and as such I feel compelled to respond to the ongoing attempt to ruin his reputation and smear his memory in the public eye. A certain coalition of interests has made a concerted effort to foster the tale of a relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, a woman who was a slave on his estate at Monticello. These interests seem intent on ensconcing this tale firmly in the Pantheon of American Myths. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the history of this lie.</p>
<p>                The tale of Jefferson&rsquo;s alleged dalliance with Sally Hemmings has circulated for 200 years. It was first put forward by James Callender, a muckraking journalist who approached Jefferson after his election to the Presidency seeking a position as Postmaster of Richmond,VA. Jefferson declined to assist him, as he had no power to confer this position on anyone. Callender took exception to this rebuff, and began to publish lurid stories claiming that Jefferson had several children by a beautiful slave named Sally Hemmings. It is said that her children all appeared to be of mixed race. </p>

&#8220;I am White. I have had literally thousands of sexual approaches by black men in my life. Some were polite. Some were obnoxious. A few grabbed my arm. Many tried to lure me into their cars. None of these events could possibly be construed even by an extreme White nationalist as myself as attempted rape. &#8220;</p>

Lets talk of the countless white killings, rapes, robbing by blacks everywhere they go.  It is long overdue to hold blacks to their crimes instead of excusing them due to white oppression.    </p>

Then they break it off and date who they are honestly attracted to, but self-satisfied with having atoned and received salvation from a black goddess.<br>

<p>No, John. You are indulging in speculation.   Nowhere was that mentioned. If it had happened (or was likely) she would have said so. </p>

<p>That author was biased in the first place. In fact, it was usually very much to the black woman&rsquo;s advantage to seduce her employer. What better or easier way to get favors?</p>
<p><i>Most American blacks have some white ancestry. For the most part this is not because of the actions of black rapists, but white slave owners and employers who used their economic power over black women.</i></p>
<p>In Europe   &mdash;   in fact for many centuries since the beginning of history   &mdash;   landowners, aristocrats, and the wealthy,  used their economic (and social) power over ALL lesser-class women. Such was the nature of things. Do you think that in America it was limited only to blacks?</p>
<p><i>At times the liaisons were consensual, like the affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings seems to have been. More frequently they were not.</i> </p>
<p><br>
Not consensual?  In that setting, I am sure that it was far MORE beneficial to the slave than to the master. (And always has been since ancient  times.)  More likely, she probably worked single-mindedly and feverishly at seducing  him. It was her ticket to a better life.   What lasting or material benefit did HE get out of it?   The benefits to her would have been great (e.g. a position in the manor house, education and elevated status for her children, even freedom). To him, the benefits would have been slim and momentary&hellip; not to speak of socially embarrassing.</p>
<p>And why do you assume that this alleged Hemmings affair is true, when it is  denied and contested to this day?</p>

		<p>As to whether Parks could have lived next to a white man:<br>
Many times in the South black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods abut one another, or they might be separated only by a road or railroad track.  It&rsquo;s certainly conceivable that Parks considered nearby white people to be her neighbors.  <br>
And, as to her attractiveness  &mdash;  Parks was specifically chosen by civil rights organizers to cause an incident on a bus.  One reason she was picked was because she was light-skinned and relatively attractive and thus more likely to engender empathy among whites.   </p>

<p>I read that book in high school in the mid-sixties, and even at the time I was struck by how sensationalistic and lurid it was.  J.H.

In any case, it is very unwise to cite <i>Black Like Me</i> with uncritical confidence.</p>

<p>Very likely.  But slavery ended 146 years ago.</p>
<p><i>&hellip;and employers who used their economic power over black women.&#8221;</i></p>

<p>You seem unaware that the &#8220;affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings&#8221; is extremely controversial and of doubtful veracity.  This, of course, does not prevent liberals and blacks from smugly citing it as established fact on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Your view of this subject appears to be strongly colored by personal feelings, media-induced stereotypes and writings of very doubtful veracity.  I suggest you begin digging a bit deeper into the topic, keeping a more open mind.<br>

		<p>As a white woman who finds race mixing repulsive and who doesn&rsquo;t like seeing white men inparticular with women of other races, I find this whole myth about the white man&rsquo;s lust for black women down right offensive.  It simply isn&rsquo;t true. It is sad that black women have such inferiority complexes that they have to dig far back in history to make up myths about white men raping them. It is absurd, dishonest, and downright hateful. </p>
<p>If you go to websites and forums that cater to black women, it is almost humorous observing what they discuss.  It is like they have to come up with their own theories about why white men in this day and age don&rsquo;t date them.  They say things like &#8220;black women have always been seen as the forbidden fruit and white men found us easily accessible in the slavery days&#8221;.  They talk as if the average white man today is walking around salivating over them but they know that they don&rsquo;t have access to them now. As if we are to assume that black women are known for being chaste or something.</p>

		<p>Poster Melinda Van Tijn told us about Rosa Parks being robbed and attacked by a black man in her own home. Funny how the liberal puke press hid this one from everyone all these years but were sure to spew their propaganda about how Rosa Parks was &#8220;ALMOST&#8221; raped by a white man in a continued effort to make whites look evil. After all how many of us knew about Rosa Parks being robbed and beaten by Joseph Skipper ( a black man ) not to mention how the liberal puke media refuses to talk about serious black crime that is committed against whites on a daily basis. <br>
     I call them (liberal pukes) because of the fraud, hypocrisy, lies,and hiding of the truth which is exhibited by these Marxists on a daily basis which makes me want to &#8220;PUKE&#8221; for sure. These Propaganda ministers along with the Democratic Party will be sure to try and once again win the next election by voter fraud, voter intimidation, monopolizing the news media, threats, and demonizing all whites and Catholics in this country. We have already heard Eric Holder say &#8220;I will not prosecute any black for voter fraud or intimidation&#8221; pertaining to the Black Panther case where the Black Panthers were outside a voting poll threatening white people with weapons and violence and using racial slurs right along with dead blacks voting and other blacks voting over and over because they don&rsquo;t need an ID. So it looks like the Democratic Party plans to use the same disgusting methods once again when they all should have gone to jail from the last time. This time I,m going to bring my buddy S&W; with me just in case I run into trouble at the voting booth, after all I have a right to defend myself, don&rsquo;t I?  Maybe not because whites don&rsquo;t have any rights in this country anymore.</p>

		<p>Maybe (probably? almost certainly?) this never happened to Rosa Parks, who, as noted, wrote pieces that should be considered either essays or fiction.</p>
<p>But it did happen to some people. Today we call it sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Anybody who did this kind of thing in the old South, post-bellum, deserves no respect. Neither do those who do it today, within or across the boundaries of color, race, ethnicity or economic status.</p>

<p>If this terrible, <i>&#8220;harrowing experience&#8221; </i>, this  <i>&#8220;rape&#8221;</i>,  was the most dreadful thing  that  Rosa Parks was ever subjected to (down there in the Deep South where helpless black women were being  preyed on and raped left &amp; right by cruel, lusting  white men),  then she must have had a very sheltered, secure, protected life indeed. </p>
<p>If so, could things  really have been so awful after all?</p>
<p>Is this the worst experience she could imagine,  for which she was prepared to sacrifice her life?   &mdash;    being offered an invitation and a drink?  Millions of women, white women,  could cite more harrowing experiences than a romantic pitch.<br>

		<p>&#8220;If you go to websites and forums that cater to black women, it is almost humorous observing what they discuss. It is like they have to come up with their own theories about why white men in this day and age don&rsquo;t date them. They say things like &ldquo;black women have always been seen as the forbidden fruit and white men found us easily accessible in the slavery days&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I have been in the military and it is a 100% fact that blacks - men and women - are convinced that whites - men and women - lust after them.</p>
<p>That is why there is so much black-on-white rape. Black men consume pornography that tells them that all white women want to be raped by a black man. </p>
<p>I also recall reading (about a year ago) an online forum after Venus Williams was criticized for wearing almost nothing on the tennis court. The black women were unanimous in that it was just white women complaining as the &#8220;sistah&#8221; was too sexy and white men were secretly lusting after her.</p>

		<p>From the original article: assuming for a moment this isn,t all purely fiction  &mdash;  - at her rejection she in her own hand writing states: &#8220;He was a bit startled and asked me not to be afraid.  He would not hurt me.  He liked me.  He didn&rsquo;t want me to be lonely and would I be sweet to him.  He had money to give me for accepting his attentions.&#8221;  The title says she was &#8220;nearly raped&#8221;.  What!!!?.  Who in his right mind could possibly think that.  He didn&rsquo;t even allude to sex, so this isn&rsquo;t even a timid attempt to solicit prostitution.  If you look at the first sentence of the next paragraph, the prosaic tone more suggests the efforts of an aspiring authoress of limited talent to write a fantasy tale.  In a day dream she might have thought of the unstated flattery of a white mans attentions,coupled with a show of racial loyalty against the hated white man.  Mercifully, this literary triumph had escaped the light of day until after her death. With enough repetition by uncritical authors, this will be incorporated in the black mythology of the civil rights movement.  <br>

This is what the Thomas Jefferson Foundation has to say about the affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings:<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Based on the documentary, scientific, statistical, and oral history evidence, the TJF Research Committee Report on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (January 2000) remains the most comprehensive analysis of this historical topic.  Ten years later, TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife&rsquo;s death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson&rsquo;s records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison, and Eston Hemings.&#8221;  <br>

		<p>Fiction or not; as so many have said this was clearly an advance or proposition; not remotely close to rape.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;The most obvious question: &ldquo;Did she ever live next to a white man?&rdquo; In 1931, I seriously doubt it.</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p>That is a good point, which at first escaped me. I had understood he was an employer and she was in a more or less helpless position to resist his amorous advances. But this white man was a friendly neighbor with romantic intentions. </p>
<p>In Montgomery, Alabama, in 1931? I, too, highly doubt it!&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>It struck me from my reading that it was her &#8220;&#8221;employer&rsquo;s neighbor&#8221;&#8220;, a fact which incidentally removes the potential coersion of loosing her job as well.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;&#8221;Most American blacks have some white ancestry. &#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p> Look at the historical market values for blacks, mulattos, quadroons and octoroons; the more white genetic makeup it had, the higher the market price and the more it was valued. It was considered much like horse breeding; mate a lower value horse with one of better bloodline/greater value and QED the offspring will be more valuable than the genetically inferior parent. Our great grandparents knew the score and left record of the facts in the slave market reciepts, even if our PC society doesn&rsquo;t want to openly say it but instead tries to spin the truth and tell us it is an achievement gap caused by &#8216;our racism&rsquo; -and not their inherent lack of ability. I am actually surprised that they carry on about it as much as they do; because -like affirmative action programs- it focuses attention on their own genetic bankruptcy. </p>

		<p>You might want to check out some of Thomas Jeffersons and Nobel Prize winner Dr. Albert Schweitzer actual quotes before you make such comments;</p>
<p>Here is Just One of each to get you started:</p>
<p><br>
Nobel Prize winner Dr. Albert Schweitzer <br>
Made a shocking statement FIFTY YEARS AGO: <br>
&ldquo;I have given my life to try to alleviate the sufferings of Africa. There is something that all white men who have lived here like I must learn and know: that these individuals are a sub-race. They have neither the intellectual, mental, or emotional abilities to equate or to share equally with white men in any function of our civilization. I have given my life to try to bring them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status: the superior and they the inferior. </p>
<p>For whenever a white man seeks to live among them as their equals they will either destroy him or devour him. And they will destroy all of his work. Let white men from anywhere in the world, who would come to Africa, remember that you must continually retain this status; you the Master and they the Inferior like children that you would help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals. Never accept them as your social equals or. They will destroy you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THOMAS JEFFERSON OUR 3RD. PRESIDENT:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people [blacks] are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: </p>
<p>How true his dire prediction proved to be.<br>

		<p>When I was young, I was routinely harassed by black males on almost every bus or train trip.  Just as someone posted above, a black male out in public would not take &#8220;no&#8221; for an answer.  The harassment would often last for the entire length of the trip, and moving to a different part of the bus had no effect   &mdash;   the harasser would simply traipse after me, getting louder and louder in both his &#8220;offers&#8221; and his denunciations of my supposed racism.  It was MISERABLE, but not rape.  In many cases, I think they KNEW that I would never say yes from the outset, but just kept up their loud offers to humiliate me and get into my personal space, keep me from studying for school, etc.  I think there was also a big element of showing off for the whole bus.  &#8220;White chicks are not off limits for me, and nobody can stop me from asking, asking, asking, because I have a constitutional right to free speech.&#8221;  Maybe the white males who were on the bus were also supposed to be humiliated by the fact that a black male was so openly pursuing a white woman.</p>
<p>I think it is entirely possible that Rosa Parks was harassed by a white male at some point when she was young.  In 1931, it was probably very hard for a white man in a small town to have any kind of sex life without being married, and a man might well have  considered a black female to be an affordable mistress, who wouldn&rsquo;t expect much if she got pregnant.  </p>
<p>If Rosa Parks did NOT work for this man, then why was she in his house?  Blacks and whites did not socialize back then, and if she was his neighbor, she probably knew his reputation BEFORE entering the house.  </p>
<p>I vote for the story being an exercise in creative writing.  </p>

<p>Thank you. The proponents of that &#8220;theory&#8221; are persistent and determined, which betrays their persohal interest in the matter and their lack of concern for truth or objectivity. They want to believe what they WANT to believe!</p>
<p>As has been explained  here on Amren many times in the past, the matter has been investigated scientifically, and NO evidence has been found to link T.J. to Hemmings or her children. It does appear that someone the the  large, extended extended Jefferson family did father some of them, but there were many possibilities, and no link to T.J.<br>

		<p>I doubt very seriously if this ever happened to her. If it did it was an isolated event and should be put into the context of Justice Dept. rape statistics which show black male rapes of White women at close to 40,000 per year,with close to zero in the oposite direction. Why is there no outcry. How could this be swept under the carpet. Why do feminist not scream out. We have been emasculated by political correctness and fear of being called out as a racist (OMG). In a normal society there would be no tolerance for this black sex crime war against Whites. Feminist have basically removed white males as their protectors and all white women are paying the price. We are not quite yet as bad off as South Africa, but it is just a matter of time.It is way past time to rise up and take back control of what is left of this once great country.</p>

<p>It has never been proven that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with Sally Hemmings.  It was shown only to be a male Jefferson and most historians believe it was Thomas&rsquo;s brother or nephew.  The villifiers of American history like to pin this one on Thomas because it degenerates our history and culture.<br>

		<p>In related news, Parks&rsquo; estate is drained by black lawyers. </p>
<p>https://goo.gl/Oodjh</p>
<p>Quote:</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The legal filing contends that Wayne County Probate Judge Freddie Burton Jr. allowed two court-appointed attorneys, John Chase Jr. and Melvin Jefferson Jr., to pile up excessive fees that drained nearly $243,000 from the estate, or about two-thirds of the cash value.</p>
<p>After the money was gone, the filing charges, the lawyers persuaded Burton to award them Parks&rsquo; vast memorabilia collection and the rights to license her name, which Parks had given to her Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development long before she died.</p>
<p>Steven Cohen, who represents Elaine Steele and the institute in the probate case, filed the request Tuesday, asking the Supreme Court to overturn an appeals court decision that stood behind Burton&rsquo;s handling of the case and accused the judge of overstepping his bounds by arbitrarily appointing Chase and Jefferson as fiduciaries when the lawyers were not previously involved in the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even so, by the modern legal definition, this did NOT constitute even  Sexual Harassment, much less rape. Harassment requires REPEATED and unwanted overtures after the harasser has been told  to stop and that his advances are unwelcome. This does not appear to have happened. He took no for an answer and that was it. A mere romantic suggestion is not Sexual Harassment.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to be nice to her, wanted to ber sweet to her, did not want her to be lonely. Is that something offensive and outrageous?   He was not being obnoxious or persistent.  Many women have experienced far worse, without crying rape and selling their memoirs to a museum.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;If Rosa Parks did NOT work for this man, then why was she in his house? Blacks and whites did not socialize back then&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Bingo!  That is also an excellent point,  which many have missed.  The story does not hold together logically.</p>

<p> &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>This is what the Thomas Jefferson Foundation has to say about the affair between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the documentary, scientific, statistical, and oral history evidence, the TJF Research Committee Report on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings (January 2000) remains the most comprehensive analysis of this historical topic. Ten years later, TJF and most historians now believe that, years after his wife&rsquo;s death, Thomas Jefferson was the father of the six children of Sally Hemings mentioned in Jefferson&rsquo;s records, including Beverly, Harriet, Madison, and Eston Hemings.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Here is the most thorough section of a longer article on this issue.  I am sorry if it seems too long for this posting forum, but I don&rsquo;t know how else to present it.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account</p>
<p>The claim that Thomas Jefferson fathered children with Sally Hemings, a slave at Monticello, entered the public arena during Jefferson&rsquo;s first term as president, and it has remained a subject of discussion and disagreement for nearly two centuries.<br>
In September 1802, political journalist James T. Callender, a disappointed office-seeker who had once been an ally of Jefferson, wrote in a Richmond newspaper that Jefferson had for many years &#8220;kept, as his concubine, one of his own slaves.&#8221; &#8220;Her name is Sally,&#8221; Callender continued, adding that Jefferson had &#8220;several children&#8221; by her.<br>
Although there had been rumors of a sexual relationship between Jefferson and a slave before 1802, Callender&rsquo;s article spread the story widely. It was taken up by Jefferson&rsquo;s Federalist opponents and was published in many newspapers during the remainder of Jefferson&rsquo;s presidency.<br>
Jefferson&rsquo;s policy was to offer no public response to personal attacks, and he apparently made no explicit public or private comment on this question (although a private letter of 1805 has been interpreted by some individuals as a denial of the story). Sally Hemings left no known accounts. <br>
Jefferson&rsquo;s daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph privately denied the published reports. Two of her children, Ellen Randolph Coolidge and Thomas Jefferson Randolph, maintained many years later that such a liaison was not possible, on both moral and practical grounds. They also stated that Jefferson&rsquo;s nephews Peter and Samuel Carr were the fathers of the light-skinned Monticello slaves some thought to be Jefferson&rsquo;s children because of their resemblance to him. <br>
The Jefferson-Hemings story was sustained through the 19th century by Northern abolitionists, British critics of American democracy, and others. Its vitality among the American population at large was recorded by European travelers of the time. Through the 20th century, some historians accepted the possibility of a Jefferson-Hemings connection and a few gave it credence, but most Jefferson scholars found the case for such a relationship unpersuasive.<br>
Over the years, however, belief in a Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings relationship was perpetuated in private. Two of her children - Madison and Eston - indicated that Jefferson was their father, and this belief has been relayed through generations of their descendants as an important family truth.<br>
That a Jefferson-Hemings relationship could be neither refuted nor substantiated was challenged in 1998 by the results of DNA tests conducted by Dr. Eugene Foster and a team of geneticists. The study - which tested Y-chromosomal DNA samples from male-line descendants of Field Jefferson (Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s uncle), John Carr (grandfather of Jefferson&rsquo;s Carr nephews), Eston Hemings, and Thomas C. Woodson - indicated a genetic link between the Jefferson and Hemings descendants. The results of the study established that an individual carrying the male Jefferson Y chromosome fathered Eston Hemings (born 1808), the last known child born to Sally Hemings. There were approximately 25 adult male Jeffersons who carried this chromosome living in Virginia at that time, and a few of them are known to have visited Monticello. The study&rsquo;s authors, however, said &#8220;the simplest and most probable&#8221; conclusion was that Thomas Jefferson had fathered Eston Hemings. <br>
The DNA study found no link between the descendants of Field Jefferson and Thomas C. Woodson (1790-1879), whose family members have long held that he was the first son of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings. Madison Hemings, Sally&rsquo;s second-youngest son, said in 1873 that his mother had been pregnant with Jefferson&rsquo;s child (who, he said, lived &#8220;but a short time&#8221;) when she returned from France in 1789. But there is no indication in Jefferson&rsquo;s records of a child born to Hemings before 1795, and there are no known documents to support that Thomas Woodson was Hemings&rsquo; first child.<br>
The DNA testing also found no genetic link between the Hemings and Carr descendants.<br>
Shortly after the DNA test results were released in November 1998, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation formed a research committee consisting of nine members of the foundation staff, including four with Ph.D.s. In January 2000, the committee reported its finding that the weight of all known evidence - from the DNA study, original documents, written and oral historical accounts, and statistical data - indicated a high probability that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Eston Hemings, and that he was perhaps the father of all six of Sally Hemings&rsquo; children listed in Monticello records - Harriet (born 1795; died in infancy); Beverly (born 1798); an unnamed daughter (born 1799; died in infancy); Harriet (born 1801); Madison (born 1805); and Eston (born 1808).<br>
Since then, a committee commissioned by the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society, after reviewing essentially the same material, reached different conclusions, namely that Sally Hemings was only a minor figure in Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s life and that it is very unlikely he fathered any of her children. This committee also suggested in its report, issued in April 2001, that Jefferson&rsquo;s younger brother Randolph (1755-1815) was more likely the father of at least some of Sally Hemings&rsquo; children. <br>

		<p>Rosa Parks was a trained activist working for the local N.A.A.C.P. in the early fifties; she attended the Highlander School in Tennessee,  a &#8220;progressive&#8221; school. Others there at the time included M.L. King (before he was well known), and current congressman John Lewis. The Parks incident was a well- planned affair. She sat in the white section of four busses before she found a driver who would ask her to relinguish the seat.  </p>

<p>Frank Speak, I agree with you. Some of you need to move on from this. Once again, (as usual) whenever there is atopic that hints of interracial sexual activity - miscegenation,rape, dating,mariage etc&hellip; too many of you let your emotions get the best of you and go insane. Give it a rest.</p>
