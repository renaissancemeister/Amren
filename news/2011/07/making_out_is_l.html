		<p>She says, &#8220;This [interracial coupling] is a moment of historic significance, one of many, made possible by our glorious democratic system.&#8221; The caption &#8220;Enjoy your freedom. Register and vote.&#8221; follows.</p>
<p>The commercial does not note, interestingly, that &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;voting&#8221; have nothing to do with anti-miscegenation laws. No state can pass an anti-miscegenation law because the Supreme Court (Loving v. Virginia) has ruled them unconstitutional; not because of any expression of the will of the people (ie democracy, voting).</p>

		<p>Loving v. Virginia did not legalize interracial marriage per se.  All it meant is that laws relating to interracial marriage could not apply differently to people of different races.  In other words, the Virginia law didn&rsquo;t allow whites to marry a non-white, but it did not punish non-whites for marrying whites or other non-white groups.</p>

		<p>I live in Ohio. I also live in a college town. About a month ago, I saw a couple in our local starbucks. The couple was a White male/Black female. They looked to be in their mid to late 20s. The woman was brown skinned, but had very White looking features, (thin lips, sharp nose, attractive body etc&hellip;) The guy looked alot like the actor Patrick Wilson. He was clearly in good shape.</p>
<p>They were dressed very trendy like, looked good and seemed to be in love with one another. The enitre time I was thinking of saying to the White male &#8220;can&rsquo;t you find a White woman to be with?&#8221; I never would have said that directly to him given his physique vs my medium height, 155 lb frame, but I sure wanted to do so.</p>

		<p>My wife and I were leaving a nice restaurant after a lovely dinner a few months ago. As we were walking toward the 5 star hotel that we were staying at, we passed by a dance club. We were looking or a shortcut to get back to our hotel and ended up in the back of the club. Guess what we saw?  A young Black woamn and White man kissing all over one another like wild animals. My wife actually froze out of shock. I quickly shook her and we kept on our way back to our destination.</p>

		<p>Yeah, as poster #3 noted, why specifically a white man/black woman?  These couplings are not super common, but they&rsquo;re not unheard of.  It would have made more sense to have a really rare combination if they were trying to promote interracial relationships across previously scandalous boundaries.  How about:</p>
<p>Mexican Amerindian man + Japanese woman<br>
Black man + Arab girl<br>
Mestizo Latino and Bangladeshi girl<br>
Arab man and Korean girl<br>

		<p>I remember a comment on this board about a White male/Black female couple in Mississippi who were married to one another. Apparently the story was on the front page of the New York Times. Both the man and women came from upper income families.</p>
<p>My point is that if this osrt of miscegenation is happening in Mississippi among the upper classes, then it can happen anywhere. </p>

		<p>Most Amereners are so upset when they see any hint of romantic intimacy (dare I say love) across racial lines, to the point that they almost view interracial relationships as biologically unnatural, thus warranting legal censure. Yet, Intimate/amorous/marital relationships across racial lines have occurred since time immemorial, ever since the phenotypes first came into contact with each other. With growing evidence that suggests that religious/cultural/racial commonality have little or no predictive power on the cohesiveness of male-female relationships, why not just accept that people will love/marry whomever they want, and individual choice however imperfect is the most desirable way for two people to get together. Given this, I ask all Amreners in the spirit of honest, civilized debate as opposed to personal attacks and name-calling, do you really believe those in interratiocal relationships are somehow mentally deranged, biologically deformed, morally bankrupt or intellectually inferior. Please back up your contentions with empirical research as opposed to emotive assertions. </p>

<p>I think &#8220;they&#8221; already have that  other fire well-started (White women going with Blacks). The White men have been resistant, since after all there is nothing more beautiful to their eyes than their own women. So now it&rsquo;s time to start working on the White men and get that self-destruction going. Then that will further inspire White women to throwing their heritage away.</p>

		<p>Bare in mind that this sex promo does not appear to have been produced by any of the major liberal organizations. So it&rsquo;s significance is indeterminate.</p>
<p>Promoting white female/black male sexual activity is unnecessary. In food and department stores, I observe that about 30% of the white women with children have the products of white female/black male sexual activity. I rarely see a black female/white male couple, or a black woman with a child much lighter than she is. I have never observed much attraction between black women and white men. In fact, I think the number of black women having children fathered by white men may be decreasing (I have not been able to get any statistics). </p>

<p>Well, she has that right, at least. It is indeed our modern liberal-democracies that promote exactly this type of thing, along with homosexuality, hyper-feminism, the cult of sinle-motherhood, and what have you. Alien ideas that would once be unthinkable in western societies. </p>

		<p>Miscegenation or rather declaring it illegal or having laws to preclude it is one aspect where I don&rsquo;t agree with race-realists. I believe these things are best left to individuals to decide, similar to religious beliefs. I take a strong libertarian position on this one.</p>
<p>While excessive promotion by mass media is unnatural, ban on miscegenation is a bit extreme too. All races have race-mixed to an extent especially when living near other races. So race-mixing isn&rsquo;t unnatural, the degree to which it&rsquo;s promoted now-a-days is.</p>
<p>A while ago when vising Yellowstone I was surprised to find out that the beaver-trappers a century ago or so, who were all white mixed with Indians quite a bit. In the context of race-mixing one might call even Alexander of Macedonia a liberal going by Amren standards.</p>
<p>This whole discussion might have been irrelevant if Whites were reproducing at or beyond replacement levels and controlling immigration.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve been seeing more of these white man/black woman combinations, not just in ads but now in TV shows.  And it seems the women are getting darker, not the very light skinned type, some of whom obviously have a white parent.</p>
<p>Looks like &#8220;they&#8221; are stepping up the concept of inter-racial coupling.  When will white people wake up to this insidious means to implant the idea that it is not only OK to mate inter-racially, but that it is the desirable thing to do?  And all too often our children are watching and taking it all in, which of course is doubtless part of the plan.</p>

		<p> Those who think there aren&rsquo;t organized efforts to promote miscegenation by our privileged cultural elites are either naive or stupid, maybe both. Our popular culture has gone into overdrive promoting race-mixing. It is the &#8220;Great Liberal Dream&#8221;: the elimination of racism through miscegenation. If we are all part of every race, we cease, as if by magic, to be racist. We see how well &#8220;the dream&#8221; has been working out in places like the Caribbean, South America, Egypt, parts of India, etc.</p>

		<p>This is just a stupid video.  In real life, they&rsquo;re not going to &#8220;make out&#8221; in front of people just to make a point.  And even if they did, people would just avert their eyes as they went by, noting that the couple should take it inside.  If the intent was to shock me, it failed.  If the intent was to make this about a white man and black woman, I say &#8220;whatever&#8221;, and refer them to reality, in which the situation almost never happens, and I don&rsquo;t care when it does.  The whole thing is one big nothing, best to be ignored.</p>
<p>If they want some true shock value, show the girl making out with a sixty-year-old white man.<br>

You must be new to this site because you fail to understand even the most elemental facts we all understand.</p>
<p>The problem is not particularly that there are interracial couples (though that is terrible enough) but that the powers that be are forcing that result onto Western Civilization.  Watch TV for like, a day, and see the combinations thrown at us.  The genius, strong, sexy Black male no White woman can resist.  You don&rsquo;t see the sequel where he impregnates her, beats her, infects her, and leaves her with a 80 IQ special ed student.</p>

With growing evidence that suggests that religious/cultural/racial commonality have little or no predictive power on the cohesiveness of male-female relationships, why not just accept that people will love/marry whomever they want, and individual choice however imperfect is the most desirable way for two people to get together. Given this, I ask all Amreners in the spirit of honest, civilized debate as opposed to personal attacks and name-calling, do you really believe those in interracialrelationships are somehow mentally deranged, biologically deformed, morally bankrupt or intellectually inferior. Please back up your contentions with empirical research as opposed to emotive assertions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Individual choice is the best way for relationships to develop simply because all the alternatives are either plainly silly (strangers dictating who one should marry)<br>
 or inherently barbaric (honor killings if one doesn&rsquo;t conform). WN&rsquo;s spend too much time on anti-miscegenation talk and this seems to alienate the broader public who generally feel that one&rsquo;s personal life is nobody else&rsquo;s business.  It&rsquo;s time to drop this from the agenda and focus on more tangible issues such as illegal immigration and reverse discrimination.</p>

<p>12-Anon: The question and challenge: &#8220;do you really believe those in interratiocal relationships are somehow mentally deranged, biologically deformed, morally bankrupt or intellectually inferior. Please back up your contentions with empirical research as opposed to emotive assertions.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not have empirical evidence of the conditions you mention, nor do I, as a supporter and believer in AMREN, believe those in interracial relationships are any of the above. Your questions though, show not that you are right and I am wrong, or vice versa, but that we are looking at the same situation from very different points of view. I desire to see the White race(s) survive into the future, and see the lack of White homelands as a direct threat to that survival. It isn&rsquo;t that non-Whites are killing us directly (although some are and desire such action), but that we are being bred out of existence via a known method which is now planned and pushed upon us by the world in general and by our own governments in particular. The &#8220;known method&#8221; of which I write is the integration of non-Whites into what should be White homelands (European nations), which is bringing about the subesequent destruction of the White populations.  Even if White populations were increasing around the world, which they are not, the loss of space is also of concern.  I believe we can also ask the same question you have posted, but with a slight change in the wording, as such: &#8220;Do you really believe those in MONO-racial relationships are somehow mentally deranged, biologically deformed, morally bankrupt or intellectually inferior. Please back up your contentions with empirical research as opposed to emotive assertions.&#8221;  Of course, your answer should be, &#8220;No&#8221;, that, as you state: &#8220;individual choice however imperfect is the most desirable way for two people to get together.&#8221;. This is not what we are seeing though, in advertisings such as the one used for this post. We constantly see mixed-race couples, everywhere. One result of which is again, a consistent diminishment of the &#8220;ideal&#8221; of the same-race couple.  I agree there is no perfect version and that everyone is different, but the result of our current process will be the diminishment, destruction, and eventual death of the White races.  This is my concern, (fear if you wish), and is not something for which I have been  brainwashed into believing.  I would not wish to see the destruction of the Black, Asian, Hispanic, or whatever races either, but where is it that ANY GOVERNMENT, political body, or economic force has as its primary goal the insurance that the White races will survive into the future? I do not see this anywhere, at least not where it is making a positive difference.</p>
<p>Further, as you state, relationships are imperfect. But what of those relationships which occured in previous, White, mono-ethnic cultures? Were they so imperfect that the world populations were driven to extinction? So bad that no woman ever had children?  To the contrary, there were enough imperfect relationships in the White nations such that we developed societies envied by ALL OTHER RACES on the planet.  Please excuse me, but I have no desire whatsoever to immigrate to anywhere in Africa.</p>
<p>I have stated here on AMREN that I am proud to be White, and that I am proud of what the White world has accomplished, Anglo-sphere included.  But, if we could all go back in time to &#8220;1492&#8221; and have a world wide enforcement against all immigration, I would agree to such a policy.  The Europeans would have had to figure out their population/space/resource issues among themselves and would have had to STAY IN EUROPE.  And if so, the White race would have had a better chance at survival than it does today.  Otherwise, if you believe mass immigration is a good thing, don&rsquo;t ask me, please ask a native &#8220;American&#8221; what they think.  If they believe they would have been better, or worse off without White encroachment on North America? I believe we can accurately guess their answer.</p>
<p>- &#8220;why not just accept that people will love/marry whomever they want, and individual choice however imperfect is the most desirable way for two people to get together.&#8221; - Yes, but in an all White (or whatever) society, you will have same race children forever.  Unless you FORCE all humans to inter-marry, you will NEVER have a one-race world.  Hence, why the determined effort to get rid of just the White race?</p>
<p><br>
I note two comments on this thread which are similar in nature:</p>
<p><br>
From 12-Anon: &#8220;Yet, Intimate/amorous/marital relationships across racial lines have occurred since time immemorial, ever since the phenotypes first came into contact with each other.&#8221; - The key phrase here is &#8220;came into contact with each  other&#8221;.  Yes, and so the native &#8220;American&rsquo;s&#8221; intermixed with Whites, and were basically dispossessed and killed off.  So much for them gaining any benefit from contact with Whites.  And please tell me, of what is the great value of intermixing?  Do you honestly believe it will bring an end to warfare? I think not.  The solution to that, whatever it is or even if it can be found, certainly lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>19-Xman: &#8220;All races have race-mixed to an extent especially when living near other races.&#8221; - Again, the key phrase here is &#8220;living near other races&#8221;.  Where we have proximity, we have interracial relationships.  As you state, not so bad in and of themselves, but I would add: &hellip;when limited by NATURE to the extent that such interracial relationships do not change a given society at speeds which bring about internal conflict.</p>
<p>AMREN, the destruction of the White races, the fear (White Flight as well as the rhetoric involved) that you see is a result of a non-natural, forced integration. We (I) do not care for it.  I see the result of such action throughout history as being the destruction of societies, peoples, nations and resources to the point where I disagree with the practice in its entirety.</p>
<p>I leave you with this question.  If you, or even ninety percent of the world&rsquo;s population believe the mass influx of non-Whites into the White world is of such benefit, and in your blindness to our concern we are driven to fight for our survival, and that fight brings great destruction to the world, just what then, is the ending benefit? </p>

<p>Why not focus on ALL aspects of the problem and not just some?</p>
<p>And btw, miscegenation is everyone&rsquo;s business, since it produces results that will affect all of society.  It is not purely a private matter that will remain behind closed doors and will  affect no one else.</p>

<p>Although many say that what happens between consenting adults is their own business, and therefore miscegenation should be left alone, miscegenation is harmful because of its effects on other people. Along with the argument that it helps to make white people extinct, it also has other immoral social effects. </p>
<p>For starters, white people who engage in miscegenation frequently settle in black areas and raise their children there. Is a parent making a good choice if they choose to live in an area filled with high crime, high poverty, poor schools, and a generally run down environment? As I pointed out an in earlier post, most people who are born into these areas will live out their entire lives in these types of areas. Would you bring children into the world while living somewhere where you stand such a high chance of being the victim of a drive by shooting, rape, armed robbery, or while living in a home infested with rats, cockroaches, and with large numbers of roaming junkies in the neighborhood? Yet that is where many white miscegenationists choose to make their homes.</p>
<p>Some people would still say that it&rsquo;s their freedom to make that choice, but at the same time, they&rsquo;re also running a high risk of producing more of these problems. Most interracial children adopt the black culture, and that means that any children resulting from these relationships stand a far greater chance of going on to cause innnocent people pain and trauma. On another website (I think it was the Council of Conservative Citizens) I read that a black man is 9 times more likely to commit a murder than a white one. Not to mention the fact that about 1/4 of black men are in jail or on probation. There are also the numerous black mob attacks that have been occuring recently, along with the general gang violence which has been a problem for years. A white person who assimilates into the black community stands a much greater chance of producing offspring who will one day become a rapist or murderer, wheras they could have produced much needed white babies instead, and raised them in a relatively peaceful white neighborhood.</p>
<p>These are my own reasons for being against miscegenation. After having lived in previously good neighborhoods which were brought down by rowdy and dangerous blacks, I do wonder why any white person would want to marry one.</p>

		<p>The fact is that we have some AMREN posters discuss their miscegenation experiences on this board. If such Whites are willing to admit this, then you can imagine how more less racially conscious Whites are more likely to behave.</p>

<p>Really? Exactly where did you read all that propaganda about White Southern men &#8220;enjoying&#8221; the company of black females?  Do you really believe all this so-called &#8220;history&#8221; as true?  Many books and many lies have been stated about Washington and all the rest. So which one do you really believe? Wonder what lies the history books will tell about all of us in 50 or so years? </p>
<p> BTW, it has been proven that Thomas Jefferson did NOT father any of Sally Hemmings children. I wish Amreners would quit with this falsehood. It has been stated on here a few times by posters.</p>

		<p>My wife points out that fashion magazines try to push the concept that black women are at least as desirable as Whites. To think otherwise is racist. By not dating black women, White males are supposed to feel guilty of the same racism. White males are now expected to think that Halle Berry is the norm, rather than the exception.</p>
