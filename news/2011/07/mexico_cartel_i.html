<h1><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7661475.html">Mexico Cartel Issues Booklets for Proper Conduct</a></h1>
 

<p>E. Eduardo Castillo and Mark Stevenson, Chron, July 20, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>An organized crime group calling itself the Knights Templar is distributing booklets saying it is fighting a war against poverty, tyranny and injustice, publicly appealing to hearts and minds in a part of Mexico where the government claims it has largely taken down the major drug traffickers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a copy of the 22-page &#8220;The Code of the Knights Templar of Michoacan,&#8221; illustrated with knights on horseback bearing lances and crosses, was obtained by The Associated Press this week. It says the group &#8220;will begin a challenging ideological battle to defend the values of a society based on ethics.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Knights Templar have been blamed for murders, extortion, drug trafficking and attacks on police. Analysts say the propaganda is part of an effort to transform a drug cartel into a social movement, along the lines of what right-wing paramilitary groups did in Colombia in the 1990s against leftist rebels-a fight in which both sides used the drug trade to finance their causes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The booklet says cartel members &#8220;must fight against materialism,&#8221; and respect women and children. It prohibits them from killing for money and says, &#8220;for all members of the order, the use of any drugs or any hallucinogen is strictly prohibited.&#8221; It mandates drug testing for members.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Along with the booklet, which also preaches loyalty to family and country, police also have confiscated banners with messages from the gang, trucks emblazoned with Templar &#8220;shields,&#8221; and even white robes with red crosses like the ones worn by the original Knights Templar order.</p>
