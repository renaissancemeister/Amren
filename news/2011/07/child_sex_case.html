			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adrian Lowe, The Age (Victoria), July 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cultural factors have been used to defend a man who sexually abused a primary school girl for three years until she became pregnant.</p>
<p>The girl, 11, was in grade 6 when she gave birth to a boy last year via caesarean section when she was six months pregnant. She is believed to be one of the youngest people to give birth in Victoria.</p>
<p>She said in a victim impact statement her abuser, whom she called &#8220;uncle&#8221; because of his closeness to her family, had &#8220;wrecked&#8221; her life and she no longer had any friends.</p>
<p>The man, 30, who can be identified only by his first name, Douangta, and his victim belong to an ethnic minority that cannot be identified, to protect the girl&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>Defence counsel Simon Moglia said Douangta had spent much of his early life in a refugee camp and retained many of his early cultural influences. In his native culture, men had been known to take child brides.</p>
<p>Mr Moglia said his client&rsquo;s intention was &#8220;to have a relationship. There&rsquo;s no avoiding it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Douangta told the Department of Human Services after he was arrested that he &#8220;fell in love with her and wanted to protect her as a husband&#8221;.</p>
<p>The girl, now 12, said in her statement: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how to have a baby. I&rsquo;m just a little girl and I was not meant to do this stuff. I trusted my uncle. Why did he do this to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl said she was &#8220;shocked and scared&#8221; on realising she was pregnant. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t ever want to have a boyfriend, get married or have another baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>The County Court heard she texted her abuser and asked: &#8220;Do you have any help for me I really pregnant?&#8221;</p>
<p>The parents of the girl told in a victim impact statement of having to undergo a lengthy cultural cleansing ceremony to rid &#8220;evil spirits&#8221; from their lives, which also involved changing the girl&rsquo;s name. The girl and her parents migrated to Australia less than 10 years ago and Douangta helped them settle. Douangta pleaded guilty to one charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child under 16 and one charge of child stealing.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Andrew Grant said Douangta told police he did not tell the girl&rsquo;s parents about taking her to see a doctor just before she gave birth because &#8220;they were really tough parents&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr Moglia conceded the conduct of his client was degrading to the girl, but said no other elements of degradation were present.</p>
<p>Judge Lisa Hannan will sentence Douangta today.</p>

		<p>A good many participants in the diversity industry are quick to point out that a disproportionate amount whites in the US are arrested for pedophilia relative to their portion of the population (side note: non-whites were very disproportionately guilty of pedophilia, these same folks would be clamoring for a reduction in the age of consent).  I&rsquo;m not aware of the exact statistics, but let&rsquo;s say I give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it&rsquo;s true.  Would these same diversity mongers dare criticize foreign customs in which &#8220;men had been known to take child brides?&#8221;</p>

<p>When will the judges and prosecutors understand that the laws of the land are of our land and not their land.  Can I go to Saudi Arabia and protest for Christian rights without being killed or jailed?</p>
<p>Well it is in my culture as an American to defend our land from foreign invaders and those against Democracy.  So can I go around shooting illegal immigrants and socialists? </p>

		<p>Sounds like a bogus defense. Otherwise why would he have concealed it all from the parents if it was really just an everyday thing? Seems he would have been in negotiation with them for this child to become his bride.<br>
The authorities sure are protective of this &#8220;ethnic minority&#8221;. The diversity just keeps on giving, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>In all honesty, I&rsquo;ve come around to the considered opinion that there is no point in judging third worlders, ANY OF THEM, as humans.<br>
It ties white minds up in anger and an extremely FOOLISH preoccupation with changing the behavior of a sub species, which is impossible.<br>
You don&rsquo;t condemn a Hyena for acting as a Hyena does.<br>
You simply AVOID THEM, at all costs.<br>
There, is that so hard?<br>
Brown and black primitives are not of our species. They are not to be judged: merely shunned, driven out and forgotten.</p>

		<p>  I figured this had to be an African thing even before the name of the accused was mentioned.I also figure as our African population here gradually increases we might see more sinister things along the line of child sacrifices and voodoo as reported in London recently.<br>
  Its also no wonder with this behaviour that population of<br>
sub Saharan and east African is skyrocketing and leading to<br>
famine,civil strife,massive poverty etc   <br>
  This was reported here locally minus the name of the accused, but I am sure he will get a suspended sentence and he will be freed and let back into the community to prey on very young vulnerable girls,whether of his own race or, shock horror,a local Aussie.    </p>
<p> As they on this site so often, you can take the African out of Africa but you cant take Africa out of the African <br>

<p>This needs to be repeated over and over because it is true. They are not &#8220;humans&#8221; in the same sense as the White race is. This is something the church missionaries never understood and still don&rsquo;t, with their misguided &#8220;good works&#8221; mentality and their &#8220;spread the Word&#8221; throughout the &#8220;world&#8221;. Was that word. &#8220;world&#8221; intentionally mistranslated to really mean ALL peoples of the world? Could it be they have misconstrued most of their own Bibles and listened to the false prophets inside the church?  </p>

		<p>Eleven is too young for sex, because the body is not developed enough to support childbirth, and the cultural reason he gave is probably an excuse. But an excessively high Age of Consent can actually hinder whites&rsquo; ability to compete with other nations by reducing the birth rate.  </p>
<p>Bulgaria and Estonia both have ages of consent of 14. </p>
<p>Almost every state in the United States allows a 16 year old to marry an older man with parental consent. A crime is only committed if they have sex before they are married. </p>

While you are quite correct in everything you say, John, the simple fact of the matter is, this time it&rsquo;s not Africans. This is a Southeast Asian incident, probably Laotian-Hmong. They are just as bad as Africans.</p>

		<p><i>Philadelphia would beg to disagree with you:</i></p>
<p>Well, technically Philadelphia would agree with me, because they are potentially preventing pregnancies at an age that would put the child at risk of injury to her body, not to mention being mentally incapable of raising a child, at least without the support of grandparents. </p>
<p>They said in the article that the sex is taking place. They really can&rsquo;t stop it, so they are doing the next best thing. Whether they are succeeding at spreading diseases or preventing pregnancies remains to be seen. But the best solution, which would be to carefully control culture and the arts (movies, TV, and music), is not feasible. </p>
<p><i>An 11-year old requesting these particular items ought to spark a police investigation of statutory rape.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s silly. Just having a condom does not automatically mean the 11 year old is having sex with an adult. Even the article you cited is about kids having sex with other kids. And why shouldn&rsquo;t the parents be given the opportunity to review the situation and THEN decide if the police need to be called? <br>

<p>Unless the state law states otherwise, statutory rape laws aren&rsquo;t only applicable to adults.  Missouri, for example, defines statutory rape as anyone =21 
<p>However, I&rsquo;m not so naive as to think that big city prosecutors spend time pursuing these kinds of cases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, why are we to believe that the other dance partner, so to speak, isn&rsquo;t overage, but way overage?  I&rsquo;ve read and heard too much to think that a 13-year old black boy is responsible for a 13-year old black girl winding up in the family way   &mdash;   Often, the father is a black man in his 20s or 30s.  Definitely stat rape.</p>
<p>One more thing   &mdash;   Why should consequence free sex be free of charge for 11-year old black boys and girls in Philadelphia City but not 34-year old white men in suburban St. Louis?  To me, it&rsquo;s an ethical concern, though far more than balanced out by the extra taxes that 34-year old white men in suburban St. Louis have to pay for the children borne by young teenage black girls in Philadelphia and the STDs that that particular community of all ages is known to spread rapidly.</p></p>

		<p>I think I made a mistake composing my last post trying to use greater than and less than symbols, which were probably interpreted as markup tags.</p>
<p>In MO, stat rape is defined as anyone who does someone under 14, or anyone 21 or older who does someone under 17.  </p>
