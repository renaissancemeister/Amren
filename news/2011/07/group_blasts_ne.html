<h1><a href="https://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&amp;id=8248036">Group Blasts New Alcoholic Beverage</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ABC (Durham), July 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Triangle coalition gathered Wednesday to express their concerns over the dangers of a new fruity malt liquor beverage called &#8216;Blast&rsquo; by Colt 45 that is now hitting stores shelves.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Durham&rsquo;s Partners Against Crime groups gathered for a brainstorming session led by Wanda Boone of Durham Together for Resilient Youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re against the dangerous effects of the product, which have to do with crime, injury, death by motor vehicle,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Federal regulators banned Four Loko nationwide last year because it contained caffeine, fueling health concerns. Colt 45 Blast does not contain caffeine, but Boone says Blast sales need to be monitored.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Just last week, Minister Paul Scott with the Messianic Afrikan Nation followed Pabst Brewing Company&rsquo;s brightly painted bus as rolled it into Durham promoting the new beverage.</p>
<p>What makes the fruity flavored 23-ounce canned drink so unsettling to him is its 12 percent alcohol content, which is equivalent to downing five beers, and it is completely legal.</p>
<p>While the FDA and the State of North Carolina have cracked down on beverages that mix caffeine and alcohol, high alcohol only drinks like Blast are still on the market. Opponents claim they promote binge drinking, and Durham activists went a step further last Thursday  &mdash;  charging that Blast is targeted at African-Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;They push this poison, this genocide in the black community, and then they act, then they don&rsquo;t want to talk to us. They&rsquo;re a bunch of cowards,&#8221; said Minister Scott. &#8220;They ain&rsquo;t putting this in the white community. They&rsquo;re putting it in the black community. Every store in the hood, that&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;re putting this poison.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is a reason why the 21st Amendment (repeal of prohibition) removed alcohol from the protection of the 14th Amendment. States have the power to regulate alcohol any way they wish fair or not to the manufacturers and sellers. They should get these trash drinks off the market. I know street corner life from personal experience. A 12-oz beer is one thing. This stuff is another.</p>

		<p>Here we go again!!  Looks like yet another shakedown from the predictable thin-skinned players.  Pabst should hang a sign in every store that reads, &#8220;Due to Minister Scott, we will no longer be selling alcoholic beverages to blacks.  Minister Scott can be reached at (-address-) if you would like to personally thank him.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s racist to promote malt liquor in black communities. It&rsquo;s racist to promote Tequila in Mexican communities. It&rsquo;s racist to promote Jack Daniels in Southern White communities&hellip;sounds so much like Charlie Daniels. We just can&rsquo;t get enough of that knee splapping, hee-haw music. The government uses this strategy to get us hooked on sour mash. It&rsquo;s racist to promote sake in Japanese-American communities. It is a racist white conspiracy to trick ninjas into alchohol addiction. They just go wild for anything made with rice.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a noble idea to campaign against alcoholism in your community, but please stop playing the racist card. There is alcoholism in every race and community. Every culture has a preferred beverage. If you drink, someone will sell you alcohol. It&rsquo;s not racism. <br>

		<p>Brother Minister Scott should just pop a top on the Blueberry Pomogranate, pour himself a glass, and chill out for awhile.  It&rsquo;s just an adult beverage.  How much it affects you completely depends on how much you drink, how fast you drink it, and whether or not you have a bite to eat while enjoying it.</p>
<p>  Really, Rev, turning a fruit-flavored chemical brew into a big fight against &#8216;racism&rsquo; is really overdoing it and going crazy.  Even Jesus turned the water into wine.  And that&rsquo;s really all this stuff is; chemically-based imitation fruit wine.  The first glass is the hardest.  I prefer real wine myself, but I&rsquo;m Italian.</p>
<p>  I didn&rsquo;t know about FourLoco until the feds &#8216;banned&rsquo; it.  I believe that it&rsquo;s still available on the shelf of the high-end grocery store in my upper-middle class Jewish/Chinese neighborhood.  I tried a whole can.  I got pleasantly drunk and with all the caffine energy I rode my bicycle ten miles.  What&rsquo;s the big deal?  Why is this a federal case!  It&rsquo;s just a combo of wine and expresso in nasty chemically-based juice format.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Drink RESPONSIBLY?&#8221;  I&rsquo;m an alcoholic with 26 years clean &amp; sober, and trust me, for us there is NO SUCH THING as responsible drinking.  When I drank - and it was NOT every day or even every week - it was for the express purpose of getting drunk.  I knew where I wanted to go and I got there as fast as I could.  The ability to &#8220;get there&#8221; wore off all too soon, and for years I was left chasing the dream, never quite getting there, but making myself and the others around me miserable.  Trust me, this taste-good booze isn&rsquo;t going to do ANYBODY any favors.  It&rsquo;ll just make potential alcoholics into real alcoholics sooner, just as drugs make both alkies and addicts sicker sooner.  Sad.</p>

<p>No they&rsquo;re not &#8220;Minister&#8221;, and you want to know why? If you weren&rsquo;t so blinded by racism you&rsquo;d understand that companies put their product in areas where it sells, business is business. Its as simple as that.<br>

		<p>I notice not one word as to the real reason this is such a problem in the non-white communities.</p>
<p>Non-whites, especially blacks are fond of using pharmaceuticals as recreational drugs.  Called &#8220;juice&#8221; (don&rsquo;t be a menace to south central LA while drinking your juice in da hood), it&rsquo;s a mixture of alcohol, something fruity (usually kool-aid), and narcotic pharmaceuticals, usually Vicodin.  </p>
<p>Basically, &#8220;Blast&#8221; is premixed &#8220;juice&#8221;&hellip;just add cough syrup.</p>
<p>Of course, explaining why &#8220;Blast&#8221; is something that targets the black community would require admitting that &#8220;juice&#8221; like crack, is a drug only blacks do.</p>

Because it would not sell in the White community. Strawberry/watermelon malt liquor? Just the thought of it is making me ill. Really this is nothing new.  Back in the the 70&rsquo;s there was something called malt duck.  Cross between beer and wine. The only people I ever saw drinking this swill,were black.  Usually sitting on a curb drinking out of a paper bag.</p>

		<p>My mom worked at the Grady Hospital in Atlanta back in the early 50&rsquo;s. Every so often, some enterprising person would go rolling through the black neighborhoods selling &#8220;Sweet-tasting&#8221; alcohol. It was a combination of 200 proof grain alcohol (i.e. everclear or something similar), mostly wood alcohol and some flavoring additives. Lo and behold, everyone would start clogging up the emergency room to get checked out because wood alcohol has this nasty side effect of making you go blind. Now there is probably some computerized system to check levels of toxicity within a few minutes. At that time, each individual test took a month of Sundays to set up and execute. By the time the police were notified, that particular snake oil salesman was long gone. Even in the heyday of the &#8220;K&#8221;, even they didn&rsquo;t go rolling through low town selling sweet tasting poisonous swill. </p>
<p>Most of the blacks I knew in high school had their preferences for various types of malt liquor. For some reason, &#8220;Private Stock&#8221; was a big hit. </p>
<p>Once again, we&rsquo;re the racists for marketing a version of something that some brotha probably cooked up in his basement. By the way, Reverend Scott, it is very easy to obtain alcohol in large quantities in white neighborhoods. The only difference between this and Sam Adams Cherry Wheat is that it would take me a little longer to drink 5 Sam Adams than one Blast. </p>

<p>Mmmmm, I don&rsquo;t know Rev. In my &#8216;hood&rsquo; down here in Australia there are so many bottle shops within a one-mile radius of my house that are packed to the rafters full of liquid intoxicants that can get a person &#8216;stewed to the gills&rsquo; for a pretty low cash outlay. Does your &#8216;hood&rsquo; have stores that sell a 4 or five litre wine-cask that contains over 30 standard drinks for a measly $10? <br>
Maybe our government down here wants to kill us off too!</p>

<p>&#8220;The Triangle&#8221; is a geo-political area of North Carolina, including Raleigh-Durham, and the moniker is often added to everything in the area e.g. Triangle Office Park or Triangle Staffing, etc. Since you mention it though, I would be willing to bet that the quoted &#8216;Minister Scott&rsquo; if asked; would define a hypotenuse as &#8216;a large grey African mammal -whose &#8216;hood is being oppressed by da&rsquo; white man&rsquo;s racisim&rsquo;; so don&rsquo;t sweat it -just another race hustling opportunist.</p>

<p><i>Non-whites, especially blacks are fond of using pharmaceuticals as recreational drugs. Called &ldquo;juice&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t be a menace to south central LA while drinking your juice in da hood), it&rsquo;s a mixture of alcohol, something fruity (usually kool-aid), and narcotic pharmaceuticals, usually Vicodin.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Basically, &ldquo;Blast&rdquo; is premixed &ldquo;juice&rdquo;&hellip;just add cough syrup.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Of course, explaining why &ldquo;Blast&rdquo; is something that targets the black community would require admitting that &ldquo;juice&rdquo; like crack, is a drug only blacks do.</i><br>

<p>Excellent catch!  &#8220;Juice&#8221; is used throughout black America.  NFL players JaMarcus Russell, Johnny Jolly and Terrence Kiel have been arrested for it and it&rsquo;s a frequently mentioned in rap songs by Lil&rsquo; Wayne.  It&rsquo;s also commonly called &#8220;purple drank&#8221;, since many common recipes turn out purple.  </p>
<p>This new drink is clearly meant to substitute for the legal ingredients in &#8220;juice&#8221; or &#8220;purple drank&#8221;.  As you said, &#8220;just add [prescription] cough syrup&#8221;!  Genius marketing, really.  </p>
<p>From Wikipedia:  <br>
     <i>Purple drank is a slang term for a recreational drug popular in the hip hop community in the southern United States, originating in Houston, Texas. Its main ingredient is prescription-strength cough syrup containing codeine and promethazine.[1] Cough syrup is typically mixed with ingredients such as Sprite soft drink or Mountain Dew and pieces of Jolly Rancher candy. The purplish hue of purple drank comes from dyes in the cough syrup.</i>  <br>

		<p>Wine typically ranges from, say 11% alcohol content to 13.5%<br>
If I drink a full bottle of syrah, or merlot, then I&rsquo;m getting about five or six drinks. Ergo, I&rsquo;d be drunk. <br>
Am I missing something here?<br>
Are blacks to be held unaccountable, or considered to be defenseless, from the effects of consuming large amounts of alcohol?<br>
does not  a 70 IQ black have some idea that consuming 23 ounces of a 12% alcohol beverage will get them drunk? Well, even THEY know that. It&rsquo;s why Colt 45 is THEIR brand!<br>
They sniff Jenkem, gor God&rsquo;s sake.<br>
You&rsquo;ll not save them from ANYTHING, if they&rsquo;re willing to inhale fermented excrement.</p>

		<p>Go to the original article for a Blast of stupidity. The report makes complete idiots of black people - as if they need it to be televised.</p>
<p>Here you have Reverend Ebonics of some screwball made-up &#8220;Afrikan&#8221; church running after a truck, like an animal, barking at it. Furthermore, the &#8220;minister&#8221; is convinced there&rsquo;s some white conspiracy to fill the &#8216;hood with a new fruit-flavored alcoholic malt liquor. I suppose the minister never studied Capitalism 101.</p>
<p>My favorite is this quote: &#8220;Representatives of the Durham&rsquo;s Partners Against Crime groups gathered for a brainstorming session led by Wanda Boone of Durham Together for Resilient Youth.&#8221; </p>
<p>I figure this must be Durham&rsquo;s ghetto community group of the week - with the obligatory fancy (but fractured) name. If you listen to Ms. Boone, and see her cohorts in the meeting, I&rsquo;m not so sure I would use the word &#8220;brainstorming session.&#8221; No chance of rain there.</p>
<p>Wanda made little sense in addressing any issue related to the drink, but okay, my impression is that she isn&rsquo;t all that bright. </p>
<p>Basically, once again, these poor oppressed blacks are crying for help because on some level they know they simply cannot control themselves and will run out and buy (steal) as much malt liquor as they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>What a truly pathetic culture.</p>
<p>Hey, like others have said, just don&rsquo;t buy the stuff. End of story. </p>
<p>If whitey is flooding the &#8216;hood with Blast then the ultimate payback is to let the bottles rot in the liquor stores. How hard is that?</p>
<p>Really, why are these people in America?</p>

		<p>Ah, poor little blacks!  Nothing is ever their fault, is it? Always the helpless, persecuted little victim, yet many blacks also claim they are a &#8220;strong race of people.&#8221; So they&rsquo;re strong, but they are oppressed?  Very interesting&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;What makes the fruity flavored 23-ounce canned drink so unsettling to him is its 12 percent alcohol content, which is equivalent to downing five beers, and it is completely legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>You could just buy (or more likely in their case shoplift) a pint of Everclear that is about 95% pure, that&rsquo;s legal too.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your point?</p>
<p>White kids have been making these evil &#8220;sweet&#8221; drinks to get drunk fast out of grain alcohol and Kool-Aid for as long as I have been alive.</p>
<p>Notice how it&rsquo;s not destroying us?</p>
<p>Us &#8220;wealthy&#8221; White folks regularly drink beverages that are higher in alcohol content all the time. (I prefer Glenfiddich single malt.) For SOME REASON we don&rsquo;t go crazy looting stores, spree killing and raping after imbibing. Imagine that?</p>
<p>I wonder why?</p>
<p>Or maybe you are trying to tell us that the people who will be buying this silly garbage canned drink are not smart enough to figure out how to mix two liquids together?</p>

		<p>Hmmm let&rsquo;s see, stock the shelves with &#8220;Blast&#8221; in a store in Hanover, New Hampshire (almost all White) and do the same in Detroit Michigan (almost all Black) and let&rsquo;s see where it sells out first. What it comes down to is that it is marketed in locations where it will sell best. If you don&rsquo;t want it, don&rsquo;t buy it, nobody&rsquo;s forcing you. Ohhh but we don&rsquo;t want to tempt the children&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Purple Drank - The Simpson&rsquo;s did a show about this 20 years ago, only the drink was called the &#8220;Flaming Moe&#8221;. The primary ingredient was &#8220;Krusty&rsquo;s Cough Syrup.

		<p>Maybe they ain&rsquo;t putting this in the white community.  Because whites aren&rsquo;t dumb enough to buy it. But then I know that&rsquo;s not true cause I notice fellow whites do some dumb things of their own. Almost seems the media would prefer for whites to be dumb as possible. </p>

<p>I guess advertising your products ability to make girls drunk and suitable for breeding is considered decent advertising these days. I&rsquo;m guessing products advertised to whites wouldn&rsquo;t use such a slogan or innuendo. White girls and black men have support groups.</p>

		<p>Exclaming a certain alcoholic beverage is responsible for the condition of blacks is a complete joke! They are criminal by nature.Discussion of anything else is a moot point.But until white people stop humoring their nonsense,our country will continue on it&rsquo;s way down the multicultural toilet. The truth is white people really are to blame for alot of this.Far too many buy into white guilt and are parylized to do anything but put up with their nonsense.</p>

<p>My point was, the 21st Amendment gives the states total authority to regulate alcohol. The states can ban all alcohol or any specific form of alcoholic beverage. If any state wanted to ban all forms of alcohol designed to appeal to street alcoholics or young people, or give municipalities or counties the right to do the same, there would be no federal appeal against that action.</p>
<p>A person who &#8220;just wants a drink&#8221; might settle for a 12-oz beer if that was all that was available. Limiting what types of alcoholic beverages are available is not going to eliminate alcoholism.</p>
<p>My point was, maybe alcoholic beverages which are specifically designed to promote alcoholism among street drinkers and young people should be eliminated from the market. The states have the legal authority to do so, with little or no possible appeal against the state&rsquo;s actions.</p>

Drinks like Blast exploit popular culture in an attempt to appeal to the most base desires in men.<br>
Ofcourse, Americans can also purchase pot, cocaine, and meth amphetymene and demand they be legal.<br>
But with drugs downspiraling the character of millions of youth, most American&rsquo;s want to put an end to drug use.<br>
Protesting the dangers of Blast is a legitimate step in the right direction.</p>

		<p>How is this stuff different from lots of the fruity mixed drinks around?  It comes in a can, which saves the trouble of buying a bottle of vodka and a quart of orange juice.  The 50 ml of vodka would comprise 1/3 of the standard &#8220;highball&#8221; glass.  Since 80 proof vodka is 40% alcohol, diluting this out to 3 times its original volume to make a &#8220;screwdriver&#8221; produces 13.3% alcohol, or&hellip; almost exactly the same as the new &#8220;Blast&#8221; product.  A 12-ounce can of &#8220;Blast&#8221; would total 375 milliters, or the equivalent of 2.5 &#8220;highball glasses&#8221;.  Drinking a can of &#8220;Blast&#8221; would thus be the equivalent of 2.5 screwdrivers.  This would then put the drinker at a blood-alcohol content of 0.100 to 0.150, depending on body weight.  Not legal to drive, but also not some horrendous poison!</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221;.  This is a case of someone calling himself &#8220;minister&#8221; who can&rsquo;t do 4th grade arithmetic.  It seems that has become a common development among older Bantu males. </p>
<p>As an aside, the hard apple cider and apple-lime cider I brew at home ends up with an alcohol content of 10%, and I&rsquo;m not dead yet.</p>

		<p>There are a lot of medical conditions that are painful to humans, but this is definitely the strongest.  You would think that will all of the money made to research a cure that it would be better by now.  It makes me wonder where all of the charities give the money too.  If a cure can&rsquo;t be found by now, why?  Someone should start answering these questions for us.  There needs to be a public accounting system that shows for where the money went.  If we showed where it all went I bet we could collect even more for charity.</p>
