			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nanette Asimov, San Francisco Chronicle, July 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>How many kids would be tempted to go to college if they didn&rsquo;t have to take the SAT and if, by ninth grade, they were guaranteed admission as long as they kept up a B-minus average in high school?</p>
<p>Oh  &mdash;  and no college application essay would be required.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s the most popular question,&#8221; said Brian O&rsquo;Rourke, dean of admissions and recruitment at Holy Names University in Oakland, which is making that very offer to high school freshmen in two East Bay school districts attended mainly by low-income students of color  &mdash;  Oakland and West Contra Costa Unified.</p>
<p>Tuition tops $30,000 at the tiny, private university on 60 wooded acres in the Oakland hills. But students who take the deal would get a discount of $9,000 to $18,000. Depending on financial need, state and federal grants could cover the rest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Rourke and Holy Names&rsquo; president, William Hynes, believe their offer will help more students get to college. Associate Superintendent Wendell Greer of West Contra Costa thinks they&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>&#8220;This program eliminates any excuse,&#8221; Greer said. &#8220;What you have here is a pathway to college for any child that walks through the door, regardless of economic status, gender, documented or undocumented. And that&rsquo;s unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 2009 study from Princeton University found that when colleges make the SAT optional, enrollment of black and Latino students goes up. Hundreds of colleges are dropping the SAT, says the National Center for Fair and Open Testing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although the Princeton study confirmed that the SAT does predict success in the first year of college, some campuses  &mdash;  including Holy Names  &mdash;  prefer to judge achievement by performance in college-prep high school classes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that students who come from urban schools tend to score a little lower on standardized tests,&#8221; O&rsquo;Rourke said. So instead of the SAT, students will have to maintain a 2.7 grade-point average  &mdash;  B-minus  &mdash;  in college-prep classes, known as the &#8220;A-to-G requirements.&#8221;</p>

		<p>A backdoor (or maybe an obvious) implementation of affirmative action is the stated motive here.  But schools like &#8220;Holy Names&#8221; and all the others that are weakening or eliminating SAT requirements have another self-serving motivation   &mdash;   If you make the SAT optional, then it means that only those who score highly on the SAT will report their scores, to impress the admissions bureaucrats.  Those that score middling or poorly won&rsquo;t want to report.  Therefore, the &#8220;SAT average&#8221; of those admitted will go up, and therefore the school&rsquo;s standing in rankings like that published by US News &amp; World Report will increase, simply because USNWR uses average SAT of those admitted as a metric.</p>
<p>It claims you have to hold down a B-Minus average in college prep courses to qualify.  With course title inflation endemic in black schools, the courses will have fancy titles but there won&rsquo;t be college prep material being imparted.  That is notwithstanding grade inflation in black schools, where you pass if you have a pulse.</p>

		<p>Obviously the admissions office is desperate.  It is also suicidal. This is a failure to look at the big picture. By admitting what amounts to thug students they might increase enrollment in the short term but it will bring down the school. How can they not see this? </p>
<p>Any real student with half a brain will never apply.</p>
<p>These loser students will, in short order, destroy whatever reputation the school had. In time, it will become known as a dumping ground for the intellectually vacant and take on a negative image. Meanwhile, I guarantee the physical plant and campus will go the way of Oakland itself.</p>
<p>I suspect this open-admissions scam is really a way to suck money out of federal coffers. What decent school would suddenly announce it is willing to admit unqualified students?</p>
<p>Actually, to save everyone time and money they&rsquo;d be better off burning the place to the ground and collecting the insurance. </p>

<p>Well, not <i>any</i> child. Just any child who isn&rsquo;t <i>white</i>.</p>
<p>I was reading about schools making the SAT optional on Steve Sailer&rsquo;s site the other day. Apparently, schools realized that if they made SAT optional they could increase their admission of dumb rich kids without dropping their average SAT scores. The idea is that every good student will still submit their SAT scores. And then they can comb through the financial aid to find the dumb rich kids who didn&rsquo;t submit SATs. And just why would they want dumb rich kids? For the money! Of course, the same idea would work with minorities. Only instead of money the motive would be to boost diversity stats.</p>

It will be interesting to see if the graduation results for this group will be made public in the future. The rate of drop out for pregnancy and incarceration should be made public also.

		<p>2.7 gpa is a B minus?  NOT IN MY DAY it wasn&rsquo;t.  It was a solid C.  So&hellip;..can we guess what&rsquo;s at play here?  Between the admitted deflation of GPA where a C is a B, and the already inflated scores on tests (providing there wasn&rsquo;t outright cheating, but only the normal giving an A for a paper barely legible and coherent marginally) this is just another way to turn out &#8220;college&#8221; graduates whose skin is black and whose IQ more properly dictates they be in some sort of trade which requires a strong back and a weak mind.  I believe part of the reason we have needed to import troublesome hispanics to do such work is because we have spent 50 years fruitlessly trying to convince ourselves blacks are smarter than they are.  Worst of all, we&rsquo;ve convinced blacks that they are smarter than they are, so when they fail, or can&rsquo;t keep up, they get angry and call it racism.  When they knew their place, and accepted their limitations, and no free ride in welfare and affirmative action existed, they actually DID work and were quite thrilled to obtain &#8220;plum&#8221; jobs like pullman or cook on the railroad, or in lumber yards and road work, or even in the fields.  We have made them nothing more than useless, hateful, angry, violent prima donnas demanding more and more, and killing us into the bargain.  Integration and the equal rights bull of the 60&rsquo;s is now coming home to roost in bankrupt States and Cities, and in flash mobs and Eric Holder with the Obimbo sitting in the Oval Office destroying what was left of this country in a single term.</p>

		<p>Holy Names must have a good reputation if it can charge $30,000 a year in tuition. It sounds like exactly the type of school that people go to in order to get away from the troubles that blacks and Latinos are making in the public colleges. This school is giving up its reputation in order to bring down its academic standards and to have more rowdies on campus. The serious students will see the value of the degrees which they worked hard for go down. Some of the other posters have said that this is to get more public funding. If it is, Holy Names is paying a huge price for it. If other private colleges follow, online and distance learning will be the last option for getting a college education. </p>

		<p>I remember taking a Kodaly class (a music class in solfege and sight singing) at HNC (it was a college back then) in the early &#8216;90&rsquo;s, as part of my graduate education. I even contemplated parlaying that one summer session into a Master&rsquo;s degree in Kodaly, I had so much fun. It was a very enjoyable, relaxing and welcome relief from the already &#8216;burgeoning multiculturalism&rsquo; of the SF Bay area.</p>
<p>The School (ostensibly R.C.) was already liberal at that time, however (gay teachers, feminazi nuns). This new bit of news does not surprise me, but the soon revocation of their accreditation, if they actually pursue this tack, (when you try to make silk purses out of sow&rsquo;s ears, what do you expect?) as well as the increase in rape, assult, car burglaries, etc. will escalate (non-white crime stats, US) until this school in the Oakland hills, once so picturesque, will come tumbling down around them, and they&rsquo;ll have to sell it for a remedial campus for the Oakland Public Schools, or something.</p>
<p>What were they thinking?</p>

		<p>Looks like a good deal for the school. They collect $18,000 per body for very little work. The few classes they will attend won&rsquo;t make much difference, it is unlikely that any coursework will be submitted, on the odd chance it is they can just mark most of it zero. 70% will drop out anyway, another 25% will be chucked out because they can&rsquo;t keep up the grade average and the possible 5% who do manage to get a degree will be held up as a shining example to the school&rsquo;s benevolence.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Actually if you are White, very wealthy and well connected, you can pretty much get into any college you want. It is not solely based on race.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>It is solely based on race because individuals truly gifted with intelligence do not just &#8216;happen&rsquo; every generation, even in class-dominated groups where there is overwhelming evidence that wealth is &#8216;heritable&rsquo;, through networking.</p>
<p>To keep a society moving ahead, you need to keep turning over the most productive, smartest, racial group -regardless- of class which means finding new blood in poor and middle class whites who are able to bring themselves into the wealthy classes, by dint of ability.</p>
<p>Only by maintaining a large enough percentage population group as to generate these random gifted-IQ individuals _in the system_ (rewarded for playing the game), can you move a society which is 90% run by wealthy white elites forwards.</p>
<p>Between the lack of talent (black), lack of interest (hispanic) and total racial hostility as envy (breeding replacement groups) we are guaranteeing that the First World Nation that America rightfully represents itself to be, will be lost in a flood of mediocrity by 2100 as a 100% &#8216;service nation&rsquo; driven economic standard as &#8216;Greater Mexico&rsquo;.</p>
<p>@16  &mdash;  SKIP,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&ldquo;But students who take the deal would get a discount of $9,000 to $18,000. Depending on financial need, state and federal grants could cover the rest&rdquo;</p>
<p>There you have it, it&rsquo;s ALL ABOUT THE TAXPAYER MONEY! I have posted before, Colleges are BUSINESSES! They are on a profit basis and if taking the lowest of the low into enrollment because the TAXPAYER will pay, the board of directors doesn&rsquo;t care as long as they get mo money!<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which still makes no sense because, regardless of race normalizing, if you are graduating students who lack the universal talent to be pushers rather than cogs or dragweights on the societal engine, you are also driving the course of society towards endemic mediocrity.  Much like the 2nd and 3rd world exists in a permanent entropy factor of.</p>
<p>Colleges and Universities exist to support the concept of excellence in creaming to the top those skills which will make it possible for the rest of us to carry on as resources deplete and we must look ever further for better and simpler and more efficient ways of surviving.</p>
<p>I look at our society and I wonder if this is what the Greeks and the Romans saw when their own worlds started to implode and the barbarians were invited across the Danube to &#8216;create strength in diversity&rsquo; among those whom they ruined.</p>
<p>If so, my biggest problem is that we are now operating at a level where 103 nuclear reactors and 307 million human beings _cannot just return to a natural state_ to await the next inspiration of genius.</p>
<p>And there is no reason why whites in particular should have to retrograde to that level because we haven&rsquo;t failed as a state or a population, so much as been infected by our own profiteerists and exploitators driven by the foul motive of short term gains.</p>
