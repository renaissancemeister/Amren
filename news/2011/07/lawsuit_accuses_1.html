			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Rojas, Los Angeles Times, July 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A lawsuit has been filed against the Bear Valley Unified School District on behalf of a Latina middle-school student who accuses her teacher of making remarks about her ethnicity that, she said, humiliated her and inhibited her education.</p>
<p>The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed the lawsuit Wednesday.</p>
<p>It says Coral Aviles, 13, was harassed by a Big Bear Middle School teacher because she is Mexican and alleges the district didn&rsquo;t do enough to respond.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nancy Ramirez, Western regional counsel for MALDEF and Coral&rsquo;s attorney, said the teacher later apologized in front of the class. But Ramirez called the response &#8220;completely inadequate.&#8221;</p>
<p>In June 2010, the suit says, the teacher asked Coral if she was Mexican after the girl entered a performing arts class wearing a soccer jersey with &#8220;Mexico&#8221; on it. The girl replied that she was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you here? Why are you in my country?&#8221; Carpenter asked Coral, according to the lawsuit. &#8220;Because this is my country. And because of people like you, I pay high taxes, and because of people like you, my insurance is sky high.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chamberlin, who was removed as principal and will become a fifth-grade teacher in August, disputes Coral&rsquo;s account. She said she investigated the situation and found that Carpenter didn&rsquo;t say what the lawsuit alleges. And according to Chamberlin&rsquo;s recollection, Coral wasn&rsquo;t wearing the shirt on the day mentioned.</p>

		<p>She was 13, old enough to lie and set up a false accusation.  When I taught at a black schools the kids occasionally accused a White teacher of saying something politically incorrect.</p>
<p>The black principal and black asst. Principal would investigate and clear the teacher.  Black kids have come up with horrible accusations against White teachers.  Not once did they believe the kid.  It was always the worst behaved black kids who made these accusations, often when they were in big trouble for beating up smaller kids or tearing a classroom apart.</p>
<p>The girl was lying.  You&rsquo;ll find she has a family membr who coached her and is active in hispanic affairs.</p>

GHETTO LOTTERY does it.<br>
Heres how it works:</p>
<p>1. Sneak into America as an Illegal Invader.<br>
2. Sign up for all the FREE programs you can, if you don&rsquo;t know what to do a local church will help you rip off American Taxpayers.<br>
3.Ask everone here legally to cater to your every whim and finally.<br>
4. If you don&rsquo;t get it File That Lawsuit.<br>

		<p>From the article:<br>
The girl, who ultimately changed classes, said at a news conference Thursday that the experience left her feeling &#8220;hurt and humiliated.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a coincidence. I&rsquo;m hurt and humiliated that 15 million+ illegal Mexicans are here ruining my country and my life. Where&rsquo;s my compensation? </p>
<p>This whole story sounds like it is filled with half-truths, bogus actions, and outright lies. Besides, there must have been at least a class full of witnesses to corroborate any story.</p>
<p>And if little Coral (future physician/astronaut) and her family of squatters are so interested in learning then what is she doing at a news conference and party to a lawsuit? </p>
<p>Oh, I forgot, we have no space program left - thanks to the $50 billion spent on teaching Shaniqua to read. I guess Coral will feel hurt and humiliated and sue the US government for that indignity.</p>

		<p>I find it VERY difficult to believe one word of this girl&rsquo;s story. A teacher saying something like THAT in this PC environment we live in? Nah, I&rsquo;m not buying it.</p>
<p>For most of us race realists, we only wish more whites had the courage to stand up and say these things, which by the way are 100% true.</p>

		<p>The rising &#8216;latino rights&rsquo; movement will be more dangerous and costly to white america than the blacks ever were.  The blacks just want a piece of the pie for free or little effort (and some blond girls every now and again).  The latinos actually feel as if they are destined to take over.  </p>
<p>I work in such an environment and have seen FIRST HAND how even the most innocent of comments can be taken out of context and real people, white people, white teachers, are getting raked over the coals and even fired.  </p>
<p>I saw a young greek (second generation immigrant) woman, who was a teacher at my school, get denied tenure because of something she said to a group of latino students that she was legally mandated to say in her health class.  </p>
<p>(Basically she said that if an &#8216;undocumented&rsquo; person is guilty of sexual harrassment, they can be deported.  This is the law, and she was trying to help them understand how in America you can&rsquo;t do a lot of the things they do in their home countries.)</p>
<p>The latinos took &#8216;offense&rsquo; (because they are SO sensitive to the word &#8216;deported&rsquo;) and they reported her to the latino principal.  It was an ugly situation with the race hustlers starting student demonstrations, etc.  We&rsquo;re doomed.</p>

<p>Oh wow!  </p>
<p><i>Another</i> typical one-sided immigrant sob story in the anti-White LA Slimes by a &#8220;Rick Rojas.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the LA Times, as they continue to insult and demean Whites, wonders why its readership has hemorrhaged in the past decade?</p>
<p><i>The Los Angeles Times has experienced, in absolute terms, both the largest decline in newsroom employees, and the largest decline in circulation&hellip;The newsroom had almost 1,300 people at its peak, and with the latest reduction will fall to about half as many.</i></p>
<p>Another thing that <i>frosts</i> me is that the media instantly take the kid&rsquo;s side over the adult&rsquo;s   &mdash;   as if 13 year old children <i>never</i> lie to get their teachers in trouble!!  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hear Carpenter&rsquo;s side of the incident, since she claims not to have said the things which the media and racial activists are accusing her of.  IF the lawsuit is tossed out of court, as well it should be, (and may not be as the California courts are filling up with racist mexican judges)  you can be sure the LA Times won&rsquo;t report it.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t <i>think</i> of siding with a White over an aggrieved non-White.</p>
<p>But, it won&rsquo;t be long before the LA Times is completely out of business  &mdash;   because  soon there won&rsquo;t be anyone left in SoCal with the ability to read.</p>

		<p>Whites need to understand that the word Mexico or Mexican is a NO NO. <br>
They are Latino even though they are not real white European Latinos but the name lends itself to being more white since they speak the white man tongue Spanish. </p>
<p>Mexico and Mexican only came into existence after 1821 when the Spanish gave New Spain their independence and the nation was named after the valley of mexica that has nothing to do with caucasoid or European. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure we can all trust someone named <i>Rick Rojas</i>, writing for the Reconquista-endorsing, America-hating <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, to give us a complete and unbiased account of this or any other mestizo-vs-gringo conflict.</p>
<p>Anybody here remember an old movie called <i>The Children&rsquo;s Hour</i>? Because I think we have a &#8220;Children&rsquo;s Hour scenario&#8221; going on here. Only now the career-ending taboo is not homosexuality but &#8220;racism.&#8221; </p>

		<p>It is very hard for me to believe that a White teacher(I am assuming she was White)would make such a direct(truthful)statement to a Mexican student.</p>
<p>Perhaps we will see that the Mexican girl lied because she harbors racist feelings towards Whites.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve believed for quite some time that I believe that Hispanics, Mexicans in particular, are more of a threat to our culture, heritage, and language than Black people. Hispanics will be a majority in this country one day and they have no intention of being fair to White people.</p>

		<p>the words mexico or mexican are a no no? I&rsquo;m an American, I served my country during Nam, and I will exercise my right to freedom of speech anytime I choose! I did not put my life on the line so I could support illegal &#8220;MEXICANS from MEXICO. I will also use the &#8220;N&#8221; word as needed or as I choose. And for the people this offends, you are free to go ruin another country. All veterans fought for Americans, not illegals, and citizenship<br>
into this country is one thing that should not be given to anyone, it should be earned. (are you listening nobama?) </p>

		<p>John and Ken on KFI AM 640 had the Maldef attorney on for an interview. When the two DJ&rsquo;s pushed the Maldef attorney to find out how much she was going to rake in for her lawsuit she wouldn&rsquo;t answer and abruptly hung up on the two.</p>

		<p>This is not too different from the Indian samosa scam. It is all about money. I forget the exact number it may be six times the number of attorneys as compared to the country with the next highest number of attorneys per capita. Forget every thing else, just follow the money, that is what most of the politicians are doing.</p>
