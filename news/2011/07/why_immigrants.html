			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Florida, Financial Times, June 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Research from the Brookings Institution recently noted that the hubs of the 100 largest US metro areas benefited most from declining crime rates. But even in the suburbs, the results were surprising: &#8220;Older higher-density suburbs saw crime drop at a faster pace than newer, lower-density emerging and exurban communities on the metropolitan fringe.&#8221;</p>
<p>When crime rates first began to plummet in the 1990s, economists such as Freakonomics author Steven Levitt argued that legalised abortion had been responsible, since unwanted children were more likely to grow up to be criminals. Others suggested America&rsquo;s astronomical incarceration rates could be responsible. {snip}</p>
<p>Elsewhere, big city police forces developed clever statistical methods to target crime, many of which proved successful. We as individuals changed our behaviour too  &mdash;  from locking our doors to investing in burglar alarms for our homes and special locks for our cars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More interestingly, however, the relationship between crime and race has greatly weakened too. From evening news headlines to crime shows on TV, popular culture underlines the propinquity between crime and race. The Brookings research assembles powerful evidence to show that that relationship has in fact declined significantly over the past two or three decades.</p>
<p>{snip} Criminologist Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University suggests that a similar &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; might be at work today, in which young black males&rsquo; increased optimism about their futures makes them more likely to refrain from violence.</p>
<p>But there is another factor in play that might be even more important: the growing racial, ethnic and demographic diversity of our cities and metro areas. Our analysis found the Hispanic share of the population is negatively associated with urban crime. Crime also fell alongside the percentage of the population that is non-white, and the percentage that is gay. But of all the variables, the one most consistently negatively associated with crime is a place&rsquo;s percentage of foreign-born residents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Along with their entrepreneurial energy and their zeal to succeed, it turns out that immigrants are good neighbours too. They exhibit many cultural and economic factors that militate against criminal behaviour, not just in their own enclaves but in surrounding communities as well.</p>

		<p>Depends on where the immigrants come from. Immigrants from India commit a far lower amount of crimes per capita than whites. FACT- <br>
Also communities filled with Indian immigrants don&rsquo;t have section 8 and other do-good welfare programs trying to locate low IQ minorities into their communities because 1) Indian immigrants are &#8220;people of color&#8221; already providing the token diversity to the liberal whites so there is no need to bring low income Blacks and Hispanics to their community to &#8220;enrich it&#8221; and 2) Indian immigrants are foolish like white liberals- they know the value of safe neighborhoods and good schools.</p>
<p>I hope you white racialists can realize the value of Indian immigrants.</p>

		<p>Okay, I&rsquo;ll bite. It&rsquo;s not that foreign-born people make such great citizens   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s that they are chasing out the black pathology, as shown in the latest census. All the major urban areas are losing black population (though you wouldn&rsquo;t know it by the mob violence.) Compared to blacks, illegal hispanics might be less prone to violence. Of course, that black pathology still has to go someplace, does it not?</p>
<p>P.S. They only contricute to &#8220;crime-free&#8221; neighborhoods if they are here legally, as otherwise, they are committing a crime by their presence, but I don&rsquo;t suppose that counts anymore.</p>

		<p>I have no desire to register to Financial Times website, so I&rsquo;m unable to see if the original article actually shows the data-set that accompanies this article.</p>
<p>But It doesn&rsquo;t take a giant leap of faith to realize that the data is being played with.  Generally, there are often many different Dependent Variables curiously missing from these types of Regressions. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t any quantifiable method to determine the amount of &#8220;awareness&#8221; sites like AMREN have instilled in many Whites that now know to avoid non-Whites like the plague.  More than any one aspect, I believe that the awareness levels of Whites has caused the greatest downswing in crime rates.  Obviously, there are many Whites that are still effected by the Kool-Aid, as is evidenced by story after story on this site, but there are many that have made the leap over to the &#8220;non-dark side.&#8221;</p>
<p>On another note, this misconception from the article, &#8220;From evening news headlines to crime shows on TV, popular culture underlines the propinquity between crime and race&#8221; is so oft-repeated that practically everyone assumes it to be true.  </p>
<p>While at college, in response to campus newspaper articles of this ilk, I often asked for someone to come up with ONE television show, ONE movie, ONE magazine and/or ONE Newspaper that CONSISTENTLY portrays Blacks negatively.  I practically begged anyone, from the stereotypical Wealthy-Liberal-White-Do-Gooder-College Girl to the Militant-Hate-Whitey-Black-Thug to produce just O-N-E of those types of media that EVER CONSISTENTLY portrayed Blacks negatively.  </p>
<p>To date, no one has ever been able to name one show.  To their lament, I was able to give many shows that portrayed Whites (particularly White males) negatively at the behest of Blacks.  Sanford and Son, The Jeffersons and the Cosby Show all portrayed White males as wimpy, nerdy, goofy and emasculated, while simultaneously portraying Blacks as industrious and entrepreneurial (practically all Black shows portray Blacks as owning their own business).  Even All in the Family, which at a glance would seem to portray Blacks negatively, often showed Blacks as practical, witty and sensible while portraying Whites as goofy and temperamental.</p>

		<p>Very strange claims made in this article.</p>
<p>After living in Southern Calif for threee years I can attest to the fact that the crime is highest where the greatest number of aliens reside.  And, that is actual experience, not some fudged statistics from leftist manipulators.</p>
<p>Right now, in most parts of LA County and around San Diego, it&rsquo;s impossible to leave anything in a vehicle during an overnight motel stay without losing it to vehicle burglars. </p>

		<p>Can this trend have anything to do with Mexican immigrants driving local Blacks out of the community?  It is true that Latinos are generally more law abiding than Blacks, but that doesn&rsquo;t make them desirable neighbors.  A friend of mine has taught at an urban Latino school for the past two years.  He was a race idealist before that, but now expresses doubt and worry if Latinos are to be America&rsquo;s future.  He has gone so far as to lecture other Whites that they don&rsquo;t understand how <i>different</i> (not his words) other races are.</p>

Yes   &mdash;   by counting every criminal of every race except Black as White. </p>

		<p>Blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit murder, and eight times more likely to commit robbery&hellip;<br>
     <br>
Hispanics commit violent crimes at roughly three times the white rate, and Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate.<br>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
Blacks have a higher crime rate than any non black immigrant group. When Hispanic immigrants displace blacks in an area the crime rate will decline. When Asian immigrants displace any other group the crime rate will decline.<br>
 <br>
I lived in San Jose, California when there was an influx of impoverished Vietnamese war refugees. I often got off work at 10:00 pm, and walked three miles through downtown San Jose to get home. I felt perfectly safe. Nothing ever happened to me. <br>
 <br>
Now I live in a predominately black area. I would risk my life if I tried that. </p>

		<p>&#8220;But of all the variables, the one most consistently negatively associated with crime is a place&rsquo;s percentage of foreign-born residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because they don&rsquo;t report crime as much, coming from countries where reporting it doesn&rsquo;t make too much difference? (Just my theory)</p>
<p>I wonder why Tokyo, Japan is the safest city on Earth? They don&rsquo;t have any immigrants to lower the crime rate, right?</p>

<p>===</p>
<p>Reminds me of Robert Putnam&rsquo;s discover thaty diversity increases distrust to such a degree that people tend to &#8220;hunker down&#8221; and &#8220;act like turtles,&#8221; that is, behave defensively:  </p>
<p>&#8220;A bleak picture of the corrosive effects of ethnic diversity has been revealed in research by Harvard University&rsquo;s Robert Putnam, one of the world&rsquo;s most influential political scientists. His research shows that the more diverse a community is, the less likely its inhabitants are to trust anyone - from their next-door neighbor to the mayor &hellip;&rdquo; (Financial Times, Oct. 8, 2006)* </p>
<p>Putnam: &ldquo;&hellip;in the presence of diversity, we hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it&rsquo;s not just that we don&rsquo;t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don&rsquo;t trust people who do look like us.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Prof. Putnam found trust was lowest in Los Angeles, &#8216;the most diverse human habitation in human history&rsquo; &hellip; When the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, they showed that the more people of different races lived in the same community, the greater the loss of trust.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Putnam radically increases levels of distrust, as Putnam indicates, such that people withdraw into a protective shell like a turtle, then diversity may well lower crime rates.</p>
<p>Richard Florida, inadvertently to be sure, may be making a valid point about diversity reducing crime rates.</p>

		<p>Actually, I do agree with CERTAIN points in this article - certainly, gay men are probably less crime prone than non-gay men on average. </p>
<p>Also, there MAY actually be an &#8220;Obama effect&#8221; at least on the higher IQ blacks. Blacks in America today see themselves on the upswing. They are portrayed as &#8220;perfect citizens&#8221; on TV and have easy access to good jobs via Affirmative Action. So why risk a prison sentence? </p>
<p>Black-on-white rape may have decreased too - after all, with so many white girls voluntarily having sex with blacks, there&rsquo;s no need to force it on them anymore!</p>
<p>But regardless of these &#8220;improvements&#8221; there remains a fundamental flaw with this article and other articles like it: The analysis always focuses on the decreasing crime RATE and not the actual number of crimes themselves. </p>
<p>Put another way, the presence of blacks and hispanics over the last 40 years has cause an artificially high crime rate to begin with. If whites lived by themselves, they would enjoy a much LOWER crime rate (as would Asians). So while the crime RATE may be decreasing, it is decreasing from an artificially high number to begin with. </p>
<p>To understand the TRUE price of black and hispanic crime, we should only compare MAJORITY WHITE areas to non-majority white areas. Or perhaps even better - compare 1950&rsquo;s crime numbers with 2011 numbers. </p>
<p>If anyone thinks I&rsquo;m wrong about this, let me know. </p>

		<p>Somebody needs to explain to Richard Florida the difference between reality and make-believe. This kind of an article, just riddled with bold-faced misinformation (if not downright lies), shows exactly how liberals think: &#8220;If I say it&rsquo;s this way, then it must be.&#8221; On top of that, he drops the &#8220;O&#8221; bomb so that anyone who tries to test the theses provided can be deemed racist.</p>
<p>And where are the statistics? Every statement he brings forth is either &#8220;argued,&#8221; &#8220;suggested&#8221; or &#8220;might be.&#8221;  </p>
<p>He also never considers that when an immigrant is a victim of an immigrant perpetrator, the crime often goes unreported or is later dropped in court to avoid retribution. </p>
<p>Therefore, the reader is expected to conclude that if blacks are no longer committing the crimes because of Obama, and hispanics have never committed the crimes because their culture  &#8220;militate[s] against criminal behaviour,&#8221; then those damned White people must be the true culprits.</p>

		<p>AmRen readers know the answer to this one. Nonwhite immigrants are not associated with high crime rates true, but their children are. One can see how short sighted the thrust of this article is. And I doubt anyone is advocating keeping the illegal aliens in the country and just deporting their American-born children   &mdash;   which would be the only possible way to turn this factoid into a long-term positive.</p>

		<p>We are we to argue with statistical logic?  It may be that certain immigrants (legal and from afar) are motivated to be economically and socially productive and do not loiter on the sidewalks and commit petit or serious crimes.  However, illegal immigration (if these factors are measured) may yield different results.  It is true that the black underclass continues to be anti-social (in spite of the &#8220;Yes, we can!&#8221; idealism of Obamaites) and can spontaneously threaten whites.  There are dozens of newspaper articles about unprovoked attacks in urban areas: black on white.  In Columbia S. C. recently, a young White high school graduate was viciously attacked and severely beaten by a gang of seven blacks who were cruising an entertainment center looking for trouble.  All of this, of course, did not make the New York Times.  Legal and effectively controlled immigration is for the most part beneficial.  It is the millions of others who are at the heart of our social problems.</p>

		<p>This guy has had some whacky ideas for cities over the years.  I think he was the guy that came into our town about ten or so years ago and said we needed more gay people to rejuvenate the downtown area.  His main idea was that the city needed to promote gays and gay events to be a more festive place.   </p>

<p>Well the evening news censors descriptions of race, so that is not a reliable indicator.</p>
<p>And TV?  TV shows and TV commercials have become extrememly biased against whites.  TV is not a reliable indicator of reality.</p>

		<p>From other articles in this forum Nancy Pelosi said there are 20,000,000 illegals here and I have read that 10% of illegals have felony records.  Thus we have  2,000,000 imported felons walking the streets doing what felons do.  we can conclude that millions of crimes happen each year that would not happen if they were not here  Where these crimes happen is open to debate but since they break the law to get here and they are convicted felons, walking across the border does not by magic alter their character.  Felons act and think as felons</p>

		<p>Praising immigrants communities for being less violent than blacks is setting the bar awfully low. </p>
<p>Last time I checked, blacks were 12% of the population, responsible for at least 55% of violent and property crimes, Hispanics at ca 20% are responsible for around 25%, and whites at around 62% responsible for ca 15%.</p>
<p>These patterns are so consistent nationally that once you know the racial composition of a given community, you already know the rates of violent &amp; property crime. </p>
<p>(In other words, there are NO black communities with less violence that the average white community, and NO white communities with more violence than the average black community)</p>
<p>Most of our immigrants are Mexican Americans &amp; Hispanics, they commit less crime than blacks, but ca 3-4 x as much as whites.</p>
<p>Where Hispanics have displaced blacks, crime rates have gone down - no mystery there.</p>
<p>The United States has reduced crime by incarcerating huge numbers of black men.</p>
<p>The FBI has reported about 1 million gang members in the United States, around 800,000 of them Hispanics, and the rest barely black.</p>
<p>Through immigration, United States has been flooded recently with Hispanic criminals, which is why drug cartel violence is spilling over into the US.</p>
<p>None of this is in any way mysterious or obscure, and frankly, any educated American who was unaware of at least most of the above is simply uninformed.</p>
<p>The incredible vagueness and refusal of specificity in the above article constitutes deliberate deception:</p>
<p>It is meaningless to blend together the crime rates of immigrants from Sweden, Somalia, Canada, and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Exactly the opposite is happening. It seems that lately, there&rsquo;s a new story on Amren every day about large gangs of young blacks attacking people in the street somewhere. The young blacks have realized that Obama&rsquo;s first term is nearly over, and they still haven&rsquo;t become rich.</p>

		<p>Sureesh, what you say simply isn&rsquo;t true. East Indians are some of the best fraudsters and white-collar criminals in the country. EBT/Government benefit exploitation and small-business tax fraud is a huge part of this, and I have seen this personally. The crime rate may not right now be equal to that of whites, but East Indians are no &#8220;model minority&#8221;: especially when Gypsies are included in that group. </p>
<p>The British situation has shown us that Indian mass migration is not a wise idea. But in any case, this country was full up 70 years ago so we don&rsquo;t need any large number of new outlanders in any case. </p>
<p>To be fair though, Indian Muslims/Pakistanis/Bangladeshis/Gypsies grossly surpass Hindus in the realm of criminality.  </p>

		<p>We as individuals changed our behaviour too &mdash; from locking our doors to investing in burglar alarms for our homes and special locks for our cars.<br>
*****************<br>
Amazing. I can remember as far back as the early-to-mid &#8216;60&rsquo;s the car sat in the driveway at night with the keys in the ignition. The doors of the house were not only unlocked, they were wide open to let in the cooler night air. <br>
As children we were free to wander pretty much at will (within limits) to go in and out each other&rsquo;s homes, use the restroom, eat cookies, get a drink of water, or play outside till the street lights came on, without very much adult supervision or scrutiny, and they knew that we were safe. <br>
Anybody living that way in this day and age of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and &#8220;lower crime rates&#8221; wouldn&rsquo;t last two weeks in our lovely &#8220;vibrant&#8221; suburbs, much less the urban jungles that now cover the landscapes of my childhood. <br>

		<p>#15 Actually, I do agree with CERTAIN points in this article - certainly, gay men are probably less crime prone than non-gay men on average. </p>
<p>Boy do you have a wake up call waiting you if you ever spend time around actual gays.  First of all, understand that the largest single group of gay men is actually the US prison population&hellip;.you know, that fun bunch of guys that think daily gang rape is a great way to spice up an otherwise dull incarceration.  And the gang/prison population freely mixes with the rest of the gay community, whenever they are on the outside&hellip;.which is all too frequently.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of crack/meth use which is epidemic among gays.  You really think that population is less prone to violence than normal men?  MOST gay men are on either the supply side or the consumption side of gay prostitution + HEAVY drug use.  Not some.  Most.  I&rsquo;m tempted to say all (since I&rsquo;ve never seen an exception).</p>
<p>The problem here is brainwashing, as opposed to actual experience.  In the media, a gay person is shown as a limpwristed wimp who wears stylish clothes and hangs out with women.  In REALITY, a typical gay man is a crack addled maniac, who does sexual behaviors that are sick, gross and deeply disturbing beyond belief&hellip;.often involving a non-willing victim (ie rape), often involving children (google some of the &#8220;gay pride&#8221; events, especially in San Fran).  Gays are constantly in trouble with the law, constantly in conflict with normal people, often in prison (sexually and in other ways) and freely mix with violent, AIDS infected psychopaths from prison.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s reality.  It will become part of YOUR reality if you let them hang around.  I learned that early, in college and have never seen an exception.  Part of my transformation from a liberal upbringing to a white nationalist adulthood. Whites have a serious problem with tolerance&hellip;..tolerance of evil.</p>
<p>As far as the issue of non-whites is concerned, only a fool believes what is written (especially what is written by the local communist propaganda outlet) instead of what is plainly before their eyes.  That reality thing again.  Reality is non-whites gathering by the hundreds, invading white areas and committing spree murders, rapes, assaults and thefts while shouting kill, the whites, kill the whites.  </p>
<p>Reality is also, they don&rsquo;t dare do that wherever armed whites live.  At least not yet.  I suspect that Obama being kicked out of office will touch off open racial civil war.  My point being, where you live is extremely important.  If you live someplace like, Chicago, it&rsquo;s simply not reasonable for you to expect to survive the next couple of years.  No army is going to come rescue you next election night (although I suspect there will be an army keeping them within certain geographic boundaries).  If you live in Detroit, you will burn with Detroit, etc.  Time is running out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bottom line.</p>

<p>The country of India, to say nothing of the sub-continent contains many groups of people. Your claim that Indian immigrants commit less crime then whites - a claim you cite as a &#8220;fact&#8221;, even though you provide no sources or studies - is absurd. Tamils alone commit a vast amount of crime, especially violent crime. (Tamils btw, invented the &#8216;suicide bomber&rsquo;). Here in Toronto, Canada, where I live, Tamil crime is as bad as black (Jamaican and Somali) crime.</p>
<p> &#8220;I hope you white racialists can realize the value of Indian immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>I see no value at all. Canada, the USA, Britain, Australia, etc, were all modern, developed nations long before any Indo-Pakistanis like you Sureesh, began inviting themselves to our countries. I can&rsquo;t think of one single benefit immigrants from the sub-continent have ever brought to my life. If I never laid eyes on an Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, Tamil, etc, ever again that would be just fine with me.</p>

		<p>I disagree with much of this guy&rsquo;s writing, but have seen some improvements in areas that experienced an influx of immigration.  Specifically, the Tenderloin district in San Franciso.  Traditionally, one of the worst neighborhoods in the city, this is where ex-cons, pimps and junkies live.  I lived there as well during my mispent youth in San Francisco. </p>
<p>Around the late 90s or so, a lot of Vietnamese and Laotians moved in to the neighborhood.  The stereotype of Asians as enterprenurial wizards was accurate.  They bought property and started a lot of restaurants and other businesses.  They also showed no remorse in chasing out the previous residents.  Calling the cops or even taking matters into their own hands. </p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Asians are invading White American areas.  </p>
<p>And, yes, Japan is refreshingly safe.  Your bicycle might get nicked at worst.  This First World refugee sleeps safe and sound at night. </p>

<p>IN COASTAL CENTRAL FLORIDA, this was the scenario as late as the early to mid 1980s. I grew up in Cocoa Beach, and it was paradise. Everything you just described, and better.<br>
We used to leave the house in the middle of the day and drive to the grocery store, with only the screen door closed!<br>
We&rsquo;d drive across the bay to the mall, (where we&rsquo;d be for hours, perhaps to see a movie), and leave the front door unlocked. I cannot count the times I, or others, simply left the keys in our cars at night. <br>
As  little kids, we roved in peaceful packs on Halloween, just having a blast, roaming far and wide, 100% safe in a virtually 100% white town. Mom and dad didn&rsquo;t worry in the least. Safety and peace, trust and decency were not even thought of. These qualities were as common as the very air we breathed.<br>
No Joke. <br>
I never saw or heard ANYONE ever say, &#8220;hey, let&rsquo;s go beat up a N****r. <br>
But if we played a sports match two bays over, in Cocoa, where there was a heavy black population, we always faced mob beatdowns, if we let our guard down. <br>
I myself barely escaped being beaten by a pack of blacks, because I punched my assailant back. The drooling twelve year old thugs just watched in a stupor, and then sloughed away. Probably, they gave their lead man a beating later on! I am sure they just wanted me to not fight back, so they could stomp my head in&hellip;such bravery, ten to one! Cowards, all.</p>
<p>When I try to explain these things to people about age thirty or younger, they just don&rsquo;t get it at all, unless they are from very rural, all white areas. <br>
That old reality, once virtually the law of the land, is almost gone, probably totally gone anywhere there is more pavement than dirt roads, for wherever there is a government benefits office, or a liberal church full of do-gooders, or a meat packing plant, or a roofing company&hellip;THERE, is a hole whence leaks in a third world flood to drown us all.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at numerous statistics and they tell the same story of crime in the last forty years in the U.S.,but why don&rsquo;t we feel safer?  The homicide rate is as low as it was in 1964 and the violent crime rate is as low as it was in 1973, so why don&rsquo;t we feel safer?  It also should be noted that the homicide rate in 1933 was over 9 homicides per 100,000 people, but to hear old timers talk it&rsquo;s like that was the safest time in our history.</p>

<p>Statistics have to be interpreted carefully. The homicide rate peaked in 1933 (probably because of prohibition related mob violence). Thereafter it fell rapidly, once the feds decided to rescind this senseless exercise in attempted social engineering. By 1940 the homicide rate was as low as it had been in 1910. Violent crime began to explode right about 1964, the year you curiously choose (?) to use as a measure. One thing to bear in mind with statistics is how third party factors can effect them without being realized. For example in the 47 odd years since 1964 there have been enormous advances in medical technology and knowledge (in much the same way as televisions today are vastly superior to anything available then). The point is that a great many people are surviving today WHO WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT 40-50 YEARS AGO. The change in the homicide rate, is not for lack of trying, just that doctors are getting better at saving victims. Fifty years ago Paramedics were just ambulance drivers. Nor were cellphones available to ring emergency contact. Many people who would have died before are now in the attempted murder rate category. You need to look at BOTH groups to accurately gauge violent crime. Some countries include BOTH FIGURES in their homicide per 100,000 figures. This makes a country like Latvia (4.8 per 100,000) falsely look almost as violent as the USA. Unfortunately the U.S. does not.  </p>

		<p>Yes,I understand advances in technology,so that&rsquo;s why I included violent crimes rates in 1973 as well.I think the tech. argument could also be made for a higher crime rate as well,since many crimes get reprted now that wouldn&rsquo;t have even 15 years ago,but the overall crime rate is still lower.Therefore,I truly believe we are safer.</p>
