			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Chicago, July 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few &#8220;bad teens&#8221; may have started the series of mob attacks in Chicago. But is their action making life difficult for other teens who just want to enjoy the city? {snip}</p>
<p>Splashing around with friends is why a lot of teens come to North Avenue Beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just come out here to have fun,&#8221; said Eric Nelson.</p>
<p>They see the police helicopter, though, and they know they&rsquo;re being watched. For some African American teens, it could mean racial profiling by other beachgoers. They feel targeted as potential troublemakers because of recent attack mobs in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically thinking I&rsquo;m going to do violence because I&rsquo;m African American. You know,&#8221; said Tracy Silmon, &#8220;They probably think I&rsquo;m going to take something down here or beat somebody up.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say they don&rsquo;t condone and will not tolerate profiling among their officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not in any way, shape or form allow any member of the Chicago Police Department to engage in racial profiling,&#8221; said Chicago Police Department Superintendent Garry McCarthy.</p>

		<p>Ireland has just had its first black flash mob attack.  A gang of Nigerian teenagers went on the rampage in the Temple bar area of Dublin city, which is popular with tourists and revellers.  Six Irish people were badly hurt, including a dj, who ended up with a fractured skull.  Its seems no where is safe from black violence.</p>

		<p>Remember the Parade article that warned that nobody should be allowed to remember the Confederacy during the Sesquicentennial unless they also talk endlessly about slavery and how the Lost Cause was all about segregation?</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/JBmSW" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/JBmSW</a></p>
<p>The print version&rsquo;s byline was &#8220;Prejudice Will Not Be Tolerated&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even when black behavior encourages racial profiling (always a good policy, don&rsquo;t wait for a mob attack), the alarm is sounded that we are supposed to &#8220;worry&#8221; that prejudice might rear its ugly head and run rampant across the White Community.</p>
<p>When blacks act like blacks, Whiteys are 1. supposed to ignore it, 2. blame themselves for it, 3. celebrate it, 4. hand how cultural and humanitarian grants and awards, 5. never ever ever say anything about the incident and connect it to blackness.</p>
<p><br>
Whites are fed up, and we will see a change is gonna come!</p>

 1.  I began to racially profile when I was about 12 years old.  I did it based on my own personal experiences with blacks.  I used my god given common sense to recognize that blacks were more violent and dangerous than most of the whites I knew.  Funny how growing up around blacks makes a person racist.</p>
<p>2.  How did racially profiling ever get to be a &#8220;boogie man&#8221; or negative concept?  That fact that &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; is now considered bad only demonstrates the power of the liberal media.  </p>
<p>3.  I have had blacks tell me they racially profile.  They avoid all black gatherings because they know of the high likely-hood of violence.   Also, we all know that black thugs racially profile their victims.  <br>

<p>I was about to say something cutting about the individual quoted here, but upon watching the video, it&rsquo;s clear that the mendacious MSM was asking a lot of leading questions to elicit exactly the kind of complaints they were looking for. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always &#8220;Oh, how does this affect the poor, pitiful, put-upon &#8216;community of color&rsquo;&#8221; rather than &#8220;what did they do to bring this on themselves?&#8221; </p>
<p>Then of course comes the obligatory shot of the police insisting that they would never, ever, ever engage in &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; followed by a black &#8220;facilitator&#8221; making excuses (while insisting that he&rsquo;s not). </p>
<p>Riiiiight. The MSM has their standard song and dance and they&rsquo;re not about to abandon it. Why should they? It&rsquo;s worked so well up to now.</p>

		<p>From the linked article:</p>
<p>&#8220;He said the focus would be on the behavior of groups of young people, not their race.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this means is that the police will not be preemptive, and must try to mitigate the damage after the blacks have already attacked and moved on.  We&rsquo;ve seen how ineffective that approach has been.</p>
<p>Here again, by the way, one could raise a mock protest about the &#8220;ageist&#8221; police who are profiling &#8220;young people&#8221;, as though ALL young people are criminals.  How dare they!  (Notice that whatever response they would give to that accusation, could be turned against them to apply to blacks.  Which is why they would ignore you.)<br>

		<p>Too bad for the victims hurt and murdered by these &#8220;flash mobs/groups of teenagers/some youths/a few bad teens&#8221;. Let them rape, rob, commit terrorism and murder all they want. Just don&rsquo;t dare refer to them as &#8220;black&#8221;, because, horror of horrors, that would be &#8220;racial profiling&#8221;.</p>
<p>We have sunk pretty low when our ruling elite, main stream media,law enforcement agencies, federal agencies and judiciary consider racial profiling a worse crime than the ones I&rsquo;ve listed above.</p>
<p>Of course they are publishing articles like this because as hard as they have lied about and tried to hide the truth from us for the last thirty to forty years it&rsquo;s getting harder to conceal what&rsquo;s going on, thanks in large part to the internet. So they try to make us feel guilty with articles like this. Notice the increase in articles like this? Two reasons. #1.- to keep up with the increase of black on white crime and #2.- they can&rsquo;t hide it anymore. And the guilt thing? Less and less people are buying into it - they know they have nothing to feel guilty about. Racial profiling saves lives - the lives of people of ALL races.</p>
<p>I want the agencies that are in place to protect us to use any and all forms of profiling: gender, age, race, religion, level of nervousness, suspicious actions, EVERYTHING. Only then will they be doing their jobs properly. And anyone who has a problem with profiling is either very naive (to the point of mental impairment), or are engaged in illegal activities themselves.</p>

		<p>On the one hand, the Chicago media proudly say they won&rsquo;t report race because it&rsquo;s not relevant.  On the other hand, they&rsquo;re worried that these raceless attacks with raceless victims will lead to racial profiling.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Basically thinking I&rsquo;m going to do violence because I&rsquo;m African American. You know,&rdquo; said Tracy Silmon, &ldquo;They probably think I&rsquo;m going to take something down here or beat somebody up.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>My suggestion to Mr. Silmon is to sign up for Twitter.  He might find that it&rsquo;s not just the cops thinking that.  While he&rsquo;s at it, he should try not committing any crimes.  Even if he were surrounded by a thousand cops on the ground and 20 police helicopters in the air, they won&rsquo;t arrest him if he&rsquo;s not violating the law.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We will not in any way, shape or form allow any member of the Chicago Police Department to engage in racial profiling,&rdquo; said Chicago Police Department Superintendent Garry McCarthy.</i></p>
<p>Obviously not.  Blacks don&rsquo;t do anything wrong, they&rsquo;re all victims of a government conspiracy, unidentified gun laws, gun company execs that live in gated mansions and Sarah Palin when she goes caribou hunting.</p>

<p>White people are still being judged, smeared, and profiled by blacks for the murders of James Byrd JR in 1998 and Emmitt Till in 1955 even though such incidents are few and far between.</p>
<p><i>They see the police helicopter, though, and they know they&rsquo;re being watched.</i></p>
<p>The police are watching for trouble. Don&rsquo;t cause any trouble and the police will very likely leave you alone.<br>

		<p> Could some of these White media moguls be any more foolish and naive if they tried really hard? Here we have black mobs rampaging with impunity in many American cities, engaging in beatdowns of (mostly) isolated White people, causing many injuries and even a few deaths, and what is CBS Chicago worried about? That it will cause &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; that effects all these millions of &#8220;good, peaceful&#8221; black kids who just want to enjoy the beach and have a good time!</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve got a message for both CBS and police officials across the country: If it looks like a duck, and waddles like a duck, and quacks like a duck &hellip; it&rsquo;s probably a black, trouble-making teenager. So lay on the profiling with a will!</p>

		<p>Actually, blacks have the most to <i>gain</i> from racial profiling. Not only does it help to keep them safer but by targeting the troublemakers it will discourage future attacks and allow the stigma to subside. It&rsquo;s the attacks which cause the stigma, not the profiling.</p>

		<p>Racial profiling would be bad. But looking for bias and prejudice in whites, and whites alone, that&rsquo;s part of the effort for social justice or something. The late Sam Francis called this Anarcho-Tyranny. They more depraved persons of color become, the more the authorities are forced to crack down on whites.</p>

Tim, it&rsquo;s all part and parcel of this deathly disease of LYING.<br>
America and the West, decided to start lying- people lying to themselves, and lying to others- about the abilities and character of browns some decades ago.</p>
<p>The Lying has become a deeply ingrained habit&hellip;as with the &#8220;pathological Liar.&#8221;<br>
We&rsquo;ve all known one or two&hellip;they are so incredibly prolific in their lies, they spin and spin and spin&hellip;it&rsquo;s dizzying, and normal people are so emberrassed by it, no one can really call the liar out. <br>
Well, that&rsquo;s the Western World&hellip;a sick, pathological liar that has to keep lying to cover it&rsquo;s messy tracks, but it just makes more of a sick mess.<br>
The place is done for.</p>

		<p>Poster #4 said:  &#8220;Funny how growing up around blacks makes a person racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it so true that most liberals and leftists who love diversity and all that usually have or had zero interactions with blacks in their formative years.  They think that everyone is just like them!  We&rsquo;re all the same inside, after all.  Right?  I grew up in a 100% white town in the midwest, but a half an hour away was a black ghetto, formerly an industrial zone that went belly up.  </p>
<p>We knew from driving through that area on a main road that the people who liver there were NOT just like us.  Two personal interactions with blacks (one when I was about 14 and the other when I was about 16) reinforced that they did not have the same basic cultural outlook as me.  </p>
<p>Why is it so hard for liberals? Out of one side of their mouths they say diversity is wonderful because it brings so many &#8216;different&rsquo; cultures and ways of thinking together, but then they will say the opposite when it suits them, that we&rsquo;re all the same. </p>

		<p>The liberals want racial profiling ended because it works as an effective law enforcement tool and results in more bona fide arrests that lead to valid convictions that routinely stand up on appellate review. The only way to keep the black mobs that the liberals use for votes and recruit to take part in protest marches is to ban profiling.  </p>

		<p>This brief article is a 100% perfect specimen of the reality of race in America. Any foreigner who wants to know the essence of race and racism in America can do no better than this article.</p>
<p>Blacks are robbing, raping, beating and sometimes murdering whites (and other non-blacks) in mob attacks for absolutely no reason. The reaction of blacks, the media, police, government and anyone who matters is to worry about people &#8220;racially profiling&#8221; blacks or being apprehensive around them.</p>

		<p>I would probably fall on the floor and die if I heard a black person turn inward and admonish their fellows for their behavior rather than get bent out of shape about the profiling that results from it.</p>
<p>This does occasionally happen but it&rsquo;s uncommon because they always get that special Bill Cosby/Clarence Thomas/Condoleeza Rice treatment that&rsquo;s reserved for blacks who don&rsquo;t toe the victimhood line.</p>

<p>It took three instances in which I was criminally abused by black men (whilst I have NEVER been criminally abused by anyone else at all) for me to stop making excuses for them and to treat all blacks with caution.</p>
<p>From personal experience and from wider evidence,I am convinced that black people are more prone to irrational behaviour and to resort to violence sooner than other peoples. I stereotype, I profile and I have never had cause to regret it. I wish I had started stereotyping and profiling earlier, it would have saved me a lot of pain and loss.</p>

		<p>Liberals are stuck with a party line that&rsquo;s becoming harder and harder to defend, and their desperation is showing.  About the only defense they have left is to hide the truth from people.  When that becomes all but impossible, like in Chicago, they try to mitigate the implications, such as &#8220;It&rsquo;s just a few bad apples&#8221; or &#8220;The police are profiling black kids&#8221;.  Chicagoans are supposed to believe that the cops are rounding up 100 blacks when one or two black teens do something naughty.  <br>
Ever since the sixties, white Americans have known the danger of going into black area.  Now, the blacks are ranging out into white areas and committing outrageous crimes.  The black President is silent on the issue.  Apparently he, like other liberals, hopes a lot of whites simply don&rsquo;t find out the facts.</p>

		<p>Black people don&rsquo;t want to be held collectively responsible for what a large percentage of them do on a regular basis.  But they want to hold white people collectively responsible and demand payback for things that a tiny percentage of them did hundreds of years ago.  See Jesse Jackson demanding that Sweden accept unlimited African immigration because, like every other country in the world including African ones, they briefly benefited from the slave trade.  Meanwhile you hear nary a peep from Jackson about what his co-ethics are doing to destroy Chicago&rsquo;s tourist and convention economy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that blacks don&rsquo;t do math or statistics very well.  By the grace of God, I do, and I decided long ago to cut my losses and deal with NAMs as little as possible from now on.  Life is much better for my decision.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s telling that the only time you will <i>ever</i> see a discussion of race in conjunction with Black gang activity from CBS is to preemptively defend other Blacks from hypothetical racial stereotyping.  Hypothetical stereotyping of Blacks is apparently a more urgent concern than ongoing racial violence directed against Whites and other non-Blacks.</p>

And that&rsquo;s not a prejudicial statement; it&rsquo;s just a statement of FACT! Blacks have a statistically much higher rate of infestation with pests and parasites. </p>
<p>Just last week at the library, there was a black woman shepherding a group of black kids (pretty big kids). They stopped at the drinking fountain and all put their mouths right down around  the fountain!  Meanwhile, she stood there and just observed.   She did nothing to correct them;  she probably would have done the same.</p>
<p>That quenched my thirst for a drink of water!</p>
<p>And have you ever worked in a place where many blacks use the restroom?  Even THEY complain about the filthy conditions. (Who made it that way?)   No further comment needed!!!<br>

		<p>If the government/media want to convince me that it&rsquo;s just a few bad apples and not an overwhelming majority of psychotic violent blacks, then they had better gives me some reliable statistics:</p>
<p>What percentage of blacks have at least mild psychopathic tendencies, i.e. low empathy for others, little or no internal conscience inducing guilt feelings, reduced sense of duty to obey the law?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing its the majority.</p>
<p>What percentage of US blacks harbor profound hatred of white people, to the point of justifying all kinds of acts of terror committed against us whites?</p>
<p>My guess: around 4/5.</p>
<p>How many blacks are so low in intelligence, say below 85, that they cannot be expected to behave like responsible adults?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing around 55%.</p>
<p>How many blacks are so retarded, IQ below 75, but they&rsquo;re basically permanent children mentally, and cannot be executed for homicide?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing around 30%. </p>
<p>How many black males are hardened criminals?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing around 40%.</p>
<p>How many abuse drugs, thereby lowering their threshold for committing violent acts?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing around 75%.</p>
<p>How many are part-time criminals, criminals of opportunity who engage regularly or occasionally in things like shoplifting, purse snatching, grabbing things from unlocked cars, embezzlement, stealing supplies from work, &#8220;barring the neighbors bicycle,&#8221; etc.?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing around 75%.</p>
<p>Until we have the facts on these and many other questions, we don&rsquo;t really know what the black community is, or what for dealing with.</p>

		<p>#29 Anonymous mentions a doctor/father who said separate drinking fountains were once mandated (in certain areas) because blacks often had communicable diseases.  That reminded me of something I once read somewhere by a commenter who described a little black boy putting his whole mouth over the water-dispenser portion of a public fountain.  One also has to wonder about spitting and groping with dirty hands.<br>
Whether blacks still have fountain-communicable diseases in large numbers, I don&rsquo;t know, but they certainly have a lot of STD&rsquo;s.  Just name the social disease, and they will lead in percentages.  Every time I hear of some white woman having a child by some low-class ghettoite, I wonder if she got more than pregnancy.  </p>

		<p>I agree with Elitist&rsquo;s analysys of Black societal dysfunction, altough I believe your last estimate about part-time criminality is a bit low at 75%. I think it is closer to 80-85%. The impulse to take things that don&rsquo;t belong to them, especially property of a White person, is developed early on in blacks. The percentage who have had multiple brushes with the law by adulthood is probably around 90%. Actual crimes committed are no doubt much higher. I avoid blacks whenever possible, they cannot be trusted&hellip;and it has nothing to do with the color of their skin.</p>

		<p>Blacks in America - a grand lesson in long reaching unintended consequences. Concepts of labor relations were somewhat different than now when most blacks were first brought over to this country as slaves and a source of labor. This was a mistake. I suppose some of the work got done, but we are now living with the consequences of that mistake.</p>
<p>This mistake was compounded by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil Rights movement, not to mention the war Americans fought to free blacks. Blacks are now here to stay and neigh untouchable, enjoying an unprecedented privileged position. They know it and exploit it as much as they can. They do what they do because we are all too willing to let them. The police could clean it up pretty quick if we turned them loose, but we keep them concerned about &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; and other such nonsense rather than effectively protecting us.</p>
<p>I am not very optimistic we will be able to reverse these unintended consequences of a mistake, moral or otherwise, none of us had anything to do with. That fact makes WHITES the victims, not blacks. Whites today have for the most part done nothing to merit abuse by blacks, be it verbally or physically. We have no reason to feel guilty.</p>

		<p>Here is part of the solution:  Stop watching CBS (and the other TV networks).  Stop buying the Chicago Tribune, the Sun-Times and ALL other big city newspapers. Do not go to their websites, either.</p>
<p>This is a long-term strategy, and it IS working.  The traditional networks are losing viewers in droves. The oldtime big city newspapers are &#8220;dinosaur media,&#8221; and are losing droves of readers.  Just stop paying them any attention. You won&rsquo;t miss them. You DO NOT NEED THEM for news or other information (they won&rsquo;t give you real news anyway).</p>
<p>Vote with you wallet.  It&rsquo;s the only vote you still have that counts. Encourage others to do likewise.</p>

		<p>All black on White attacks are racially motivated:</p>
<p>The blacks KNOW their victims are Whiteys, even before attacking.</p>
<p>That knowledge creates foresight and intent- they intended to attack a White once they saw the Whiteness and didn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>Missing a last clear chance to avoid attacking incurs the liability of &#8220;racially motivated attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>It goes further.  Antiracism training that attacks &#8220;unearned White privilege&#8221; is a racially motivated attack.  Hate crime.</p>
<p><br>
Transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your worst nightmares, and you are extremely right&hellip;</p>
<p>And one day soon, your beautiful and brilliant White White White daughter will come home from school (public or private, doesn&rsquo;t matter) or from Sunday school (any mainline denomination, plus the Anabaptists) proclaiming her enlightened status by demanding that &#8220;making white babies is a hate crime against global dignity.&#8221;    As soon as that happens, go ahead and accept your fate as the future grandparents of a &#8220;privileged&#8221; mulatto.

<p>Just because there have been an explosion of blacks mobbing stores and strpping them of merchandise.</p>
<p>Just because their are many recent cases of groups of blacks beating lone whites into coma&rsquo;s and laughing as they walked away.</p>
<p>Just because there have been large bands of blacks robbing, raping and assulting whites there is no reason to suspect large groups of blacks to be up to no good.

I would love to see some enterprising photo journalist start tracking and documenting one or more of these mahogony mobs in action.  Since we know the police and main stream media want to look the other way to avoid being tagged as &#8220;racist&#8221; it must be up to someone, probably white, who will witness and document the truth.  Thanks not only to low cost high quality video equipment and the internet the MSM is becoming obsolete.  </p>
