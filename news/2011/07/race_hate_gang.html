<h1>&#8216;Race Hate&rsquo; Gang in Temple Bar Orgy of Violence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ken Foy, Herald, July 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A MOB went on a wave of random race violence on Temple Bar, which left five Dubliners with horrific injuries.</p>
<p>One man  &mdash;  a Dublin DJ  &mdash;  was almost killed in the attack as he suffered serious head injuries when he was set upon by the gang.</p>
<p>The level of violence has shocked gardai and the many witnesses to the race hate orgy  &mdash;  believed to be the first of its kind in the city.</p>
<p>One member of the African gang was arrested today in pre-dawn raids by detectives across the capital.</p>
<p>Five Dubliners, all aged in their 20s, were left with horrific injuries in the October 2010 attacks, which have only come to light now.</p>
<p><strong>Shocked</strong></p>
<p>The gang  &mdash;  all aged in their late teens  &mdash;  savagely attacked six Irish people in the Temple Bar area of the capital in the early hours of October 10 last.</p>
<p>The gang, who are heavily involved in other street robberies and beatings, are all expected to appear in court.</p>
<p>Sources say that even seasoned detectives were left &#8220;horrified and shocked&#8221; by the extreme level of violence used in the attacks which occurred in the Eustace Street and Curved Street areas of Temple Bar at around 3.30am on the date in question.</p>
<p>A senior source explained: &#8220;We believe that what happened on the night was motivated by racism  &mdash;  that is racism against white people.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the suspects were first questioned they tried to use racism as a defence  &mdash;  they tried to say that they had been racially abused by the victims for being black.</p>
<p>&#8220;But absolutely no evidence of that was ever uncovered and gardai are satisfied that the culprits were not racially abused.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dozens of people witnessed the shocking chain of events which started when two young men and a woman were randomly attacked at Eustace Street.</p>
<p>In the space of less than three minutes, five people were left with terrible injuries as bottles, punches and kicks were used to hurt the victims.</p>
<p>In the most serious incident, a DJ who was standing on Curved Street was set-upon and almost killed by the gang of thugs.</p>
<p>A source explained: &#8220;The DJ was standing outside a premises while other assaults were going on around him. His DJ bag  &mdash;  with records in it  &mdash;  was on the ground beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the gang picked up the DJ&rsquo;s bag and ran off, with the victim running after him. Then the attacker turned around and punched the victim, knocking him unconscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the DJ hit the floor, the culprit stamped on the man&rsquo;s head in what was a ferocious display of violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;This victim is very lucky to be alive  &mdash;  the entire left side of his head was broken because of that stamping incident. The victim ended up having to have a metal plate inserted into his head  &mdash;  if this did not happen he would have lost his eyesight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sources have revealed that another victim suffered a fractured skull in an incident in which gardai believe a glass bottle was used.</p>
<p>The gang are now expected to face a huge number of charges, including multiple serious assault charges, violent disorder, theft and production of an offensive weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Trafficking</strong></p>
<p>The arrest was made this morning after a massive investigation by detectives from Pearse Street Garda Station.</p>
<p>Other suspects were being hunted today.</p>
<p>The mother of one of the suspects has a conviction and served jail time for trafficking children into France from Nigeria.</p>
<p>The gang is suspected of being involved in other street assaults and have links to a criminal who was involved in robbing head shops and has been convicted of hijacking a Dublin taxi.</p>

		<p>Where are the militant Irish nationalists when you need them?  </p>
<p>Probably confined to a corner by the ideological Marxist elements, who make common cause with all non-whites because they&rsquo;re &#8216;oppressed like the Irish&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They wouldn&rsquo;t lift a finger against Nigerian invaders, because to do so would be a sin against their red politics.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the world Ireland. The Irish were so proud to become a part of the EU and now they have the &#8220;trouble&#8221; too. </p>
<p>The Irish have such a reputation as being pugnacious! Good boxers and all that stuff! &#8220;Don&rsquo;t get my Irish up&#8221;! Well, you Irish had better live up to your reputation and soon because of what is coming your way and big time and in some instances such as this already has.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This victim is very lucky to be alive&#8221;</p>
<p>The DJ is lucky to be alive. Stomping a man like that while on the ground is using lethal force. The intent was to hurt very bad for life or kill. And all for a bag of records. And the perp probably did not even know what was in the bag when he stole it. Merely stole just to steal.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world Ireland. HEY, doesn&rsquo;t that Miss Ireland have a Bantu boyfriend? Maybe that boyfriend can talk some calm and sense into the perps. An encounter session and all that. Sure!</p>

		<p>Multiculturalism at its best. Right ace?? Remember diversity is our strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five Dubliners, all aged in their 20s, were left with horrific injuries in the October 2010 attacks, which have only come to light now.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this gang of feral beasts attacked and nearly killed some of their victims, all Whites, and the story is just now getting air time?? So for 9 months, these racist thugs were on the loose and apparently most Dubliners had no warning to be careful or that racist thugs were attacking Whites??? Sounds like the Irish media has the same problem reporting the truth about blacks that the American media has.</p>

<i>The level of violence has shocked gardai and the many witnesses to the race hate orgy</i></p>
<p>How can you prepare yourself for something you&rsquo;re not willing to admit to?</p>
<p>When they start noticing the behavior of blacks, they will be called &#8216;racists&rsquo;. When a black man is killed, even during the course of a crime, more black Africans will be forced on them until the Irish learn not to be bigots and racists.</p>
<p><i>The mother of one of the suspects has a conviction and served jail time for trafficking children into France from Nigeria.</i></p>

<p>Already a pattern has emerged yet few people are willing to speak their minds about the facts.</p>

		<p>Its only a matter of time before the &#8220;youths,&#8221; &#8220;teens,&#8221; and &#8220;young people&#8221; here in the US escalate from flash mobs to violence like this.</p>
<p>And they love, love, love to stomp on people&rsquo;s heads.  They love it almost as much as the sucker punch.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to maintain a 20 foot safety zone around yourself at all times, and if that zone is violated then fight as if your life depended on it.  It probably does.</p>

		<p>I was surprised to hear this get such little coverage here in Ireland. However, I don&rsquo;t see this as the beginning of anything- it happened in Dublin. They&rsquo;re lucky to be alive pulling a stunt like that- blacks are NOT popular with most Irish people, thanks to the amount of scamming the relatively small black population engaged in when they started to arrive first. Any attempts at flash mobbing here would be stamped on hard. Ireland is still a very homogenous country, racially speaking, and the Irish have an almost genetic abhorrence of being bullied, cajoled, &#8220;told how it is&#8221;, etc. Also, the courts here take a very dim view of violent criminals, I expect them all to go to prison, and I doubt very much they will enjoy their time there. </p>

		<p>It appears that with all the attacks, the blacks are trying their best to send a message to please find an immediate way to remove them from the country.</p>
<p>Albeit, their crys for removal seems to be falling on deaf ears and crushed skulls. </p>

<p>Why not deportation? These animals have proven that they cannot co-exist with the native people, let alone assimilate.  However, I guess it&rsquo;s difficult for the Irish image if they judge the miscreants too harshly since just a while back they went so out of their way to recognize Muhammed Ali as an Ennisman, &#8220;just a Paddy like us.&#8221; </p>

		<p> Good for this Irish journalist for not being afraid to call a spade a spade, and good for his editor who did not &#8220;censor&#8221; his copy. The story was written in a style which reminded me of American newspaper stories about racial attacks back in the 1960s, before the mainstream media became terrified of offending blacks.</p>
<p> Anywhere and everywhere they go, the Sons of Africa leave a trail of havoc and blood in their wake. What will it take to wake up White people, be they American, European or whatever, to the fact that they must start standing up for each other, and against these thugs, as we once did?</p>

		<p>Jamie Kelso was on Irish radio, I believe last year, talking about race and how the Irish need to stop the influx of foreigners, especially other races.  Except for two women, all the liberals were calling up calling him racist.  But, the Irish, in Ireland, have never really had genuine interaction with Africans of any stripe.  Ditto for most Europeans.  They all take delight in calling white Americans racists but they, too, are going to learn the hard way that Africans need to stay in Africa.  The black man is a menace no matter where he goes and his history, and past experiences with whites, has nothing to do with it.  They simply cannot function normally in a Western society.<br>

		<p>In these situations Irish politicians should be required to say something. In no way should they be allowed to stay quiet or run for cover. Just let them dare try to say this is all due to systemic racism on the part of white Irish. They can&rsquo;t say that so they&rsquo;ll have to say something else. Make &#8216;em squirm. </p>
<p>#9 Tom, don&rsquo;t count on some innate Irish sense of self-defence. We&rsquo;re talking about the long march through the institutions by the cultural Marxists. Whatever national character the Irish have can be disarmed by sociology professors and their disciples. </p>

		<p>Only Nigerians, or any other west African descended population, can be stupid enough to abuse the hospitality of those who &#8216;gave them refuge&rsquo;, and start physically assaulting the host population even though the hosts vastly outnumber them in numbers and power.<br>
  From what I know and seen about the Irish, they are making a very big mistake.Not only are the Irish themselves are capable of inflicting the most ruthless, merciless violence that is humanly possible, they never forget.They will keep grudges and feuds going for decades, nay centuries, until their enemies are utterly defeated and driven out, this is an ancient atavism buried somewhere not too deep in the Irish character.<br>

<p>Tom! I hate it but I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re going to be proven wrong. Muslims have a serious beach head in Ireland, they know the welfare scams and some of the PMs there are muslim which means it is all over but the violence. The IRA fought against the British who at least were the same color as the Irish, why are they doing nothing to stem or dtop the flow of black muslims into Ireland and right onto the welfare rolls and police blotters? AND BTW all those blacks are muslims and they care nothing for laws of Western civilized nations.</p>

		<p>I imagine what I&rsquo;m about to say will strike many as being off-the-wall or paranoid at best. I have a hardhat stowed in the trunk of my car. It now compliments the assortment of non-lethal to lethal implements I have close at hand. Recently I was talking to a neighbor when he mentioned he had been given a bunch of hardhats. He asked me if I wanted one. On impulse I took it. It has a knob on the back for adjusting the fit. You can crank it down so that it fits tight to the head. </p>
<p>I first became aware of blacks liking to go for the head when I saw what they did to Reginald Denny during the LA riots. Now some will say that having the hardhat in the trunk will not do me any good as it is not likely to be close at hand when I need it. Others will say that if I make it to the car, the sensible thing to do would be to make an escape. All of this is true. Should the occasion arise, I will face a fight or flight decision. <br>

actually, humorously enough the left has created a pseudo narrative in most european countries that the UK and France, for example are &#8216;nations of immigrants&rsquo; - the bbc actually had a propaganda documentary about this.</p>
<p>And since we (whites) are all, collectively guilty of imperialism we &#8216;deserve&rsquo; multiculturalism (it&rsquo;s amazing that when you boil down a leftist arguments, they usually unwittingly say that multiculturalism is a punishment for our exploitative past) </p>

<p>Yes, growing up in an Irish American family I know that the Irish are good at keeping grudges. They even joke about it in NYC. I was listening to a newscast many years ago and they were talking about this politican who was mad at someone and one of the newscasters said, &#8220;He has an Irish memory. He never forgets a grudge.&#8221; </p>

It&rsquo;s tragic that the Irish opened the door for these miscreants. Getting rid of pests is always more difficult than keeping them out.</p>
<p>Some of the Irish posting here say that they are prepared to fight. I hope so and I wish them luck.</p>
<p>However, resistance to your destruction will not be tolerated. First you will be denounced as racists. Should you persist, force will be used, not against the Africans but the native Irish.</p>
<p>First and foremost, close the door. Next cut off benefits to &#8216;refugees&rsquo;.  </p>

<p>Nonsense. In my experience   &mdash;   and most of my family is of Irish descent   &mdash;   the Irish are astonishingly hospitable, easygoing, and, yes, more than a little naive.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t all bad traits, but don&rsquo;t fool yourselves. The United States has lost entire cities to this kind of problem. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got space to build anew, and maybe even the resources to renew, if a metropolitan area of a few million people   &mdash;   like Detroit or St. Louis   &mdash;   gets wrecked. </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>@9 Tom,</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
I was surprised to hear this get such little coverage here in Ireland.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Years of the troubles which more or less made it impossible for Irish Nationalism to exist without being viewed as terrorism has effectively castrated Irish pride.</p>
<p>This would not have happened if the IRA had won their battle and sent the British packing.  It could still be reversed if the Irish used their wallets to buy back their homeland, one British Family at a million-pounds time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
However, I don&rsquo;t see this as the beginning of anything- it happened in Dublin. They&rsquo;re lucky to be alive pulling a stunt like that- blacks are NOT popular with most Irish people, thanks to the amount of scamming the relatively small black population engaged in when they started to arrive first.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Ireland is a &#8216;relatively small island&rsquo; Tom.  It doesn&rsquo;t take but a few to ruin the Emerald Isle forever as a permanent underclass.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Any attempts at flash mobbing here would be stamped on hard. Ireland is still a very homogenous country, racially speaking, and the Irish have an almost genetic abhorrence of being bullied, cajoled, &ldquo;told how it is&rdquo;, etc. Also, the courts here take a very dim view of violent criminals, I expect them all to go to prison, and I doubt very much they will enjoy their time there.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Heard it all before.  Until and unless you admit that racial identity has been removed as a the sole legitimate source of contention you NEED to to have to protect what is yours from outside genetic and cultural influences, you will always be tap dancing around the law trying to justify your hate of the &#8216;other/outsider&rsquo; based on the last vile thing that they did.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s a legal point of diminishing returns as you can very well see here, where the very existance of the attacks at all is denied until it is effectively past-tense/fait de accompli.</p>
<p>It is not particularly Irelands peoples&rsquo; or cultural fault, we have seen this same tactic deployed _everywhere_ that the multiculut attacks white culture base.  Destroy moral certainty.  Imply guilt.  Deny/Suppress contrary evidence.</p>
<p>Whites, as a truth driven culture, are incredidbly vulnerable to those whose talents are those of lies and misdirection/misinformation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t assume &#8220;Well it&rsquo;s a good thing it wasn&rsquo;t worse or we would have stomped them&hellip;&#8221;  Because what you are really saying is: &#8220;The enemy&rsquo;s tactics are working because I never -knew- a thing, until they got this bad&hellip;&#8221;.</p>
<p>At which point, the next question you have to ask is: &#8220;Okay, so how much has been withheld that I -still- don&rsquo;t know about&hellip;?&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Irish have to ask the Coppers about what should be common knowledge truths, then the enemy has already won the information access denial campaign.</p>

		<p>No 28 is 100% right:</p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost, close the door. Next cut off benefits to &lsquo;refugees&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Ireland - start lobbying your politicians NOW to take the above action - before it is too late</p>

		<p>When will people learn? You let in blacks into your country and community, stuff like this always happens. Crime goes up, school test scores go down, social services soak up more tax dollars, young and naive White girls will rebel and will get knocked up by black thugs who hate these girls and their race of men, etc.</p>
<p>What is scariest about this is not black behavior. It is all the White Liberals and White Marxists who defend this behavior and will make the excuse that blacks do this stuff because they are poor and/or because they were oppressed. </p>
<p>People, wake up, grow up, and start holding people accountable!</p>

&ldquo;&hellip;From what I know and seen about the Irish, they are making a very big mistake.Not only are the Irish themselves are capable of inflicting the most ruthless, merciless violence that is humanly possible, they never forget.They will keep grudges and feuds going for decades, nay centuries, until their enemies are utterly defeated and driven out, this is an ancient atavism buried somewhere not too deep in the Irish character.<br>
If the Irish turn on the Nigerians, I pity them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, growing up in an Irish American family I know that the Irish are good at keeping grudges. They even joke about it in NYC. I was listening to a newscast many years ago and they were talking about this politican who was mad at someone and one of the newscasters said, &ldquo;He has an Irish memory. He never forgets a grudge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So true. Let&rsquo;s hope it works to their advantage on the Emerald Isle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure &#8216;tis a sad thing tah see but it&rsquo;s apparent that the sons of<br>
Hibernia have lahst their bullocks. I&rsquo;ll be hoping that they&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; them back soon.<br>
I&rsquo;ll be raisin&rsquo; a pint to yah. Slainte!</p>
