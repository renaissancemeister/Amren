			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen, July 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just over one-in-five Likely U.S. Voters (22%) now support government programs that give special treatment when hiring to women and minorities.</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 63% oppose programs that give hiring preference to women and minorities. That&rsquo;s up eight points from 55% a year ago. Fifteen percent (15%) are not sure about them. {snip}</p>
<p>When asked specifically about &#8220;affirmative action programs&#8221; in general without any further description, 26% of voters favor them, while 45% are opposed. Thirty percent (30%) are undecided.</p>
<p>A plurality (46%) of voters believes affirmative action programs discriminate against white men, but 31% disagree. Twenty-three percent (23%) are not sure.</p>
<p>Still, just 10% think affirmative action programs have been a success. Twenty-five percent (25%) rate them as a failure, while 60% feel they fall somewhere in between success and failure.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A well-intentioned program dating from the 1960s, affirmative action has now become a political catch phrase, particularly among some white voters, for what is seen as mandated quotas based on special treatment or even reverse bias. For many minority voters, however, opposition to affirmative action is viewed as racism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-four percent (74%) of black voters favor government programs that give special treatment to women and minorities. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of whites and 66% of voters of other races oppose these programs.</p>

		<p>We wish this report would stay secret.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know what happens next?  More programs are designed to make us suffer.</p>
<p>Look for the SPLC to issue a report that equates the rise in reluctance to foster diversity and help minorities with the rise in dangerous hate groups, extremist Tea Partiers, and the rich not paying their fair share.</p>
<p>With all the governmental powers that bow to the SPLC, we will be subjected to enforced sensitivity training for diversity and inclusion. </p>
<p>Apostate Christians will start demanding that White Humanity subjects itself to racism audits, which always find racism, and that the NAACP should be given the power to design our anti-racist therapy.</p>
<p>Nothing good happens for us from this news.  No politician can use it, because none will allow themselves to suffer the racism charge.</p>

		<p>After seeing the kind of people who get affirmative action boosts around me, I am doubly against it.  Some of the most incompetent, under educated losers have been supervisors of mine.  Yeah, I&rsquo;ve had lousy white bosses in the past, but at least they could spell, use words correctly that over two syllables and make coherent plans, reports, etc.  </p>

		<p>The reason why this is up is because so many more people are out of work.  One of the core values of liberalism&hellip;&hellip;other people should be forced to give unreasonably to the undeserved.  That&rsquo;s OTHER people, never the liberal themselves.</p>
<p>When they had a job, they were all for some other person who deserved the job being passed over to give it to someone else not qualified.  But now that THEY are looking for work, it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>An appropriate response would be, &#8220;liberals need not apply&#8221; on job forms.  In fact, when Obama was elected, some business did exactly that, checking people&rsquo;s cars for Elect Obama bumper stickers and tossing those resumes in the trash.  Since then, I&rsquo;ve noticed the number of Obama bumper stickers these days is exactly zero.  Which means the liberals scraped them off in shame.  Certainly, they are keeping a low profile these days.</p>

<p>Had he lived, Martin Luther King, Jr. would have been among the black majority on the issue of &#8220;special treatment&#8221;: </p>
<p>&ldquo;[I]f a city has a 30 percent Negro population, then it is logical to assume that Negroes should have at least 30 percent of the jobs in any particular company, and jobs in all categories rather than only in menial areas.&#8221;  (Martin Luther King, Jr., Chapter 5, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community, 1967, found also in A testament of Hope: The Essential Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther, p. 603) <br>

<p>Quite a contrast to the sentiments expressed in his &#8220;I Have A Dream&#8221; speech in 1963: </p>
<p>&#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&#8221; (August 28, 1963 at the Lincoln Memorial)</p>
<p>Of course, I guess it depends on how one defines &#8220;content of their character.&#8221; </p>

		<p>After seeing all the destruction done to the United States just in my lifetime, as a woman, I now understand why only white men were permitted to vote in the early years.  They were actually clear-headed back then.  Then, the gentle persuasion.  Then, the attacks.  Then, it was all changed.  And, once it changed (sadly, by their own volition), this country ended up on a path that is leading it to a state of near total worthlessness.</p>

		<p>The job should go to the person most qualified.  What&rsquo;s the point of learning a trade or getting a college degree if you get passed over for some unqualified high school drop out because of hiring quotas?  Besides, aren&rsquo;t hiring quotas racist?  I&rsquo;m being denied a job ONLY because I&rsquo;m White.  How is that NOT racist?</p>

		<p>People of different races and cultures come to America all the time with nothing but the desire to work and do well, many of them do quite well.</p>
<p>Yet these people on A.A. have had it for 50 years and they still can&rsquo;t make it, they really should be ashamed of themselves?</p>
<p>But only in the USA do they have to hire firefighters who are afraid of fire or policement who can&rsquo;t read or write. This is pretty pathetic, if you ask me?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t normally comment anonymously, but this time I must.</p>
<p>Some years ago we had an African (not an African-American, but an African) apply for a position for which she had no qualifications. However, an administrator was so thrilled that a person of color had applied that a special position was created and we were forced to hire her. </p>
<p>Although she has been given awards for outstanding performance, an outside review stated that she lacks the qualifications for her position and that her performance is substandard; as a result, she was told to improve herself. But nothing will change.</p>
<p>We try to give her duties that will minimize the damage to our department.<br>

		<p>Interesting, but not surprising, that blacks and non-blacks are pretty much opposite with black supporting special treatment for blacks by 3:1 and non-blacks opposing it by more than 2:1.</p>
<p>I find it amusing that 10% think AA works, but 26% favor AA.  So what exactly are those 16% (over-simplifying the math a bit) thinking - failure is OK as long as it makes my white guilt go away?  </p>

		<p>&#8220;the NAACP should be given the power to design our anti-racist therapy&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they already do that? From reading our textbooks, I would have to believe they come NAACP approved, if they not written by a member. After all, &#8216;supporting the NAACP is what one can do to make a difference&rsquo;. It seems as tho unless you properly place, by each tidbit of information, all blame for all problems in history and in the present (and do so with the proper enthusiasm) on white men, this would be a dangerous sign of insensitivity. Would it not?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m baffled that no one seems to realize that Affirmative Action was primarily a Cultural Marxist concocted tool that was designed, not to &#8216;help&rsquo; unqualified minorities necessarily, but to disenfranchise the white male from as many areas of employment and influence as possible inside White Western Civilization.</p>
<p>I will admit that this realization is one that took me a few years to finally understand, but when I began to connect the dots - this revelation just fell right into my lap.   The #1 goal of Cultural Marxism is to destroy White, Western civilization - and since the White male is the architect of Western civilization, the Cultural Marxists understood  that to kill the West that they despise so passionately, the white male had to be destroyed and removed from the equation.</p>
<p>In essence, Affirmative Action has been nothing more than a declaration of war upon the white male.   Remember, as Professor Kevin MacDonald has pointed out:  The Cultural Marxist enemy always tries to cloak their personal ethnic agendas under the false guise of &#8216;compassion&rsquo; for the welfare of the underdog, but what is really going on is their stealth warfare against the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant group who they seek to destroy and replace with their own tribe.</p>
<p>And, perhaps the most incredible aspect to this Cultural Marxist war against WASPs and white men in general, is how many reasonable intelligent white people (white liberals, white morons who are neo-cons) are willing to join in and help them wage war on their own race.</p>

		<p>That may be true,but it all comes down too white males being excluded always and white women are just there for the ride while our race gets exterminated,of course any minority is going to get special treatment.</p>

		<p>The last people in the USA that should demand EVERYBODY be treated exactly equal are the blacks and the females. They should be careful what they wish for, end of so called affirimative action, seperate standards for cops, firefighters, military, ETC.. I saw a documentry on TV about Cop training, the women in the &#8220;hand-to-hand fighting&#8221; part was just flat out silly, turned their head sideways and fought like a kitten playing with a ball on a string, sad thing is one of them doing this was the &#8220;leader of the class.</p>

		<p>For me, the best discription of affirmative action is: &#8220;The pampered daughter of a Black multi-millionaire gets thirty extra credits on her college acceptance score which are denied to the hard working son of a White waitress and single mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly someone with Obama&rsquo;s history, if he had been White, would have never been elected to the Senate, let alone the presidency.  </p>

		<p>What people dont realize is &hellip; all this affirmative action stuff does NOT APPLY to the higher rung professional jobs. (except maybe law where they have to have a token black. )</p>
<p>For these, women are routinely NOT EVEN GIVEN AN INTERVIEW. No interview then they don&rsquo;t have to deal with it. Worse, the few women who do make it to the top - say Carly Fiorina - are such wacked out nutjobs (lets offshore all the good engineers) they ruin companies because its taken that to break through all the macho barriers in place. Well ok there&rsquo;s no excuse for Fiorina. what a disgrace. Meg Whitman (lets throw our engineers in the street and import Indians) was at least slightly better</p>

		<p>What gets me is; if I lose a race -why would I want -much less pride myself on- a first place medal? Affirmative action amounts to nothing more than an admission that they cannot compete on a fair and level field, that they are so vastly inferior that they need the government to force someone to give them a position. </p>
<p>On a second note; with the (terrible, horrendous, insufferable and blatantly suicidal) decision to put women in combat; does that mean my little niece is going to have to fill out a selective service card and prepare to be drafted in the event of war? Are you comfortable with that? I am not. On the Titanic, it was women and children first; an honorable and noble concept that recognizes (if women had been bright enough to notice it (no offence intended)) that our women and children are the future -and vastly more valuable than we males. Sadly, this has been lost in the vapid screechings of the feminazis that dictate on college campuses and the halls of congress, preaching about how oppressed women were&hellip;once upon a time, and in very select circumstances -at least among Europeans. They have become their own destroyers -so angry about (what?) that they would cut off their nose to spite their face.</p>

		<p>#2, The intersting, not to say one of the most sickening things about affirmative action, is the fact that an illegal alien,say from Mexico, who got amnesty as happened in 1986 under the so -called &#8220;great communicator&#8221;, and actually be put first over any European-American, where jobs are concerned and other rights as well. How about that? Want to know the only thing that really amazes me about this? Where are all the European-American lawyers, and others enraged over this and ready to fight it? Been twenty five years, and not a one of them in sight. This is one of the reasons I don&rsquo;t blame illegal aliens and other scoundrels that come to the U.S. to get the goodies. They can clearly see how stupid most Americans must be.</p>

		<p>I first visited the US in 1979 and we as a family hooked up with many of our friends in the US but started our holiday in Florida. </p>
<p></p>
<p>My Dad was in the RAF as a pilot and he also spent some time at the Annapolis academy and West Point on exchange schemes back in the early 60&rsquo;s-(He was at RAF Cranwell in the UK -the RAF Academy for trainee officers).</p>
<p>He made friendships that have lasted to this day -An Eastern Airlines pilot friend lent him his Southwind camper (It was a massive rig back in the 70&rsquo;s)and we had a grand tour around Florida, staying at all the theme parks.</p>
<p>My &#8220;Uncle Jim&#8221; spent many a Christmas with us whilst he was based with the USAF in the UK. He was an EOD Master Sergeant in the USAF with a citation from the President and two tours of Viet Nam as EOD under his belt and 1 tour from Thailand flying Puff the Magic Dragons.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(He used to leave Phantom F4 models at the bottom of our beds  and Crackerjack when we were kids when was on leave from Viet Nam.)</p>
<p>As soon as we landed in Miami my Uncle Jim put us up, took us to USAF Homestead and showed us round the airstrip and the Jets. (This would never be allowed these days, nor would going up to the cockpit in a civil airliner which I remember doing on many occasions). I was absolutely amazed; we got to climb up into the cockpits of real F4 Phantoms and dream we would one day pilot one. </p>
<p>My brother and I and Mum went home and my Dad and Jim came back the next morning, tight as you like, but laughing their t**s off. Jim had organised a reunion for the class of &#8216;62 EOD + fighter pilots, mostly as an impromptu event for my Dad.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the point you ask to all this reminiscing? Well, the point is this: As a non-American citizen, (but proud as hell to have the American friends we have) this was the time that in living and recent memory the &#8220;West&#8221; had this relationship nailed. It was an unspoken trust that we would all cover each other and were all united in the pursuit of freedom and justice for all. What I gave you was a very real and fondly remembered time in our lives when this &#8220;worked&#8221;.</p>
<p>I remember Miami as being most definitely predominately white in make-up, where you could walk down any street, (My Irish mother would usually worry herself silly, but not in Homestead) we did as we pleased as young lads (under 10). </p>
<p>Would that be the case these days?- From the posts here on AmRen over the years and various news sources it seems clear that this would be extreme folly now. So Why? Well it wasn&rsquo;t the case when there were no Cubans, Hispanics and Haitians and Caribbeans in Florida. We now have a similar problem with non-indigenous races in the UK.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The question I want to leave you with is this: Why are our governments deliberately causing us so much pain and suffering from non-white immigration policies? Who are they in hock too? Why are they happy to destroy their own people?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Any takers to this one, (cause it&rsquo;s driving me round the bend to figure out why)<br>

		<p>Tonight on PBS &#8220;&#8216;News&rsquo;Hour&#8221;-really the propaganda hour- there was a story about a convicted black murderer(!!) that now makes $80,000 per year after receiving a college degree. I did not stick around for the details, but I&rsquo;m sure his blackness played a significant, if not decisive, roll in his college success. I&rsquo;m sure this human interest story was reported in only the most glowing terms. </p>
<p>It would be interesting to compare this rags-to-riches tale of a black killer with similar story about a White criminal who was released and became a successful business man. I&rsquo;m sure the White man&rsquo;s story would be reported in less than flattering fashion.</p>

		<p>the racial/gender quotas are a way for women and blacks/latinos compete on a level playing field because of their genetic shortcomings from white males.  Blacks with thinking/reasoning/education and women with motor control/physical/spacial reasoning.  Hispanics are little better than the blacks but their IQ as a race is 10 points highr tah blacks and 12 points less than europeans.  im sure you all heard about the new bedford fire captain tests where the whites passed and no one black passed.</p>

		<p>With reference to comment #6, I thought I was the only person thinking this idea.  Nice to see someoneelse on board, particularly a woman.  To summarize, the reason this country has gone the tubes is because the white men became stupid and gave it all away.  Chaos now reigns.  When we finally reach liberalism&rsquo;s goal of us all being equal; unfortunately we will all be equally miserable.</p>

		<p>This is a sign that Americans are sick of our first Black President.  I think whites are realizing that they are becoming the minority and their rights are really at risk.  </p>
