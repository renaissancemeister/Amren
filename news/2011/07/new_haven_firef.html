			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New York Times, July 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White firefighters who won a race-discrimination case before the Supreme Court in 2009 will receive about $2 million in damages from the City of New Haven, officials said Thursday. The settlement helps end a seven-year-long legal battle that propelled national debate over racial justice.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that officials had violated white firefighters&rsquo; civil rights when they threw out the results of promotion tests in 2003 because too few minority applicants did well. After that ruling, the case went back to United States District Court in Connecticut, where the firefighters sought back pay, damages and legal fees.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lawyers for the city said on Thursday that the firefighters would receive about $2 million total and that the city would pay their lawyers&rsquo; fees and costs of about $3 million.</p>

		<p>Glad to hear that the city is taking care of attorneys&rsquo; fees and court costs for the plaintiffs. Otherwise, each firefighter would have gotten precious little; lawyers usually take a huge bite of such settlements. Also, I hope the city of New Haven has learned something from this incident.</p>

		<p>The sad truth is that a 2 million dollar hit is much cheaper than instituting a metric that properly qualifies the best candidate, and at the same time offends the unqualified.</p>

		<p>Wow, a whole 100k for each man. And only a 8 year wait for justice. Seems like there is a far greater settlement for a single black &#8220;victim&#8221; with far less evidence that he was wronged. </p>
<p>Still it is a victory for our side. Cities are now on notice that they may be held financially liable if they discriminate against Whites. I would say Dayton Ohio should be next for what they did to White candidates for police officers. </p>

		<p>So, when people of color are victims of injustice, it&rsquo;s a harrowing experience and we should all properly feel concern for the victim. But when whites are victims of racism, such as these firefighters, it&rsquo;s not really injustice at all, rather something positive that &#8216;helps propel the national debate over racial justice&rsquo;. Much like the word &#8216;reverse discrimination&rsquo; even this case is used as a chance to move the discussion to the real victims, &#8216;minorities&rsquo;? <br>

		<p>Well, looks like some good news to be heard.  A few months back when I, a detestable white male, made the mistake of trying to seek assistance from my local employment office in finding a job, had to fight with the lazy, incompetent, Hispanic female when applying for a job that I was, according to the description posted, qualified for.  Ultimately all I got was my cell phone stolen and a parking ticket.</p>
<p>When you are white and down and out in this country, good luck buddy!  </p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&rsquo;t no rest for the wicked.<br>
Money don&rsquo;t grow on trees!<br>
I got bills to pay,<br>
I got mouths to feed,<br>
There ain&rsquo;t nothing in this world for free!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;The settlement helps end a seven-year-long legal battle that propelled national debate over racial justice&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it just me, or is this phrase &#8220;The settlement helps end a seven-year-long legal battle that propelled national debate over racial justice&#8221; meant to propel or steer the the readers mind back to the &#8216;real victims&rsquo;. When I think of &#8216;racial justice&rsquo; or &#8216;social justice&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t think of whites. In fact, of the hundreds of times I&rsquo;ve read those words whites were never the ones the author intended to find &#8216;social justice&rsquo; for. Not once. In fact, whites were the only group &#8216;excluded&rsquo;, or perhaps they are considered the cause of injustice, instead. That&rsquo;s weird because no group in America needs &#8216;social justice&rsquo; or has needed it more. Does the author even once add that the firefighters (and all whites of course) are victims of injustice, or are the focus of justices cause?</p>
<p>By the second sentence the writer has boomeranged the &#8216;debate&rsquo; here back to the real issue, minority disadvantage, much like the word &#8216;reverse discrimination&rsquo; is meant to do? Is there a reward in the news industry for accomplishing so much in so little space? </p>

		<p>Lets not forget the additional victims in all of this, the public and taxpayers. Taxpayers are on the ones who end up on the hook whenever some liberal lunacy like the reverse discrimination here comes due. It is the taxpayer who will pay the $5 million ultimately, not &#8220;the city&#8221;. Perhaps the citizens of New Haven should sue the officials who were responsible for this debacle at the time, as they failed to uphold the duties of their office- as government officials they were sworn to follow the laws to provide equal opportunity for all, including whites.</p>
<p>The citizens of New Haven also have been cheated for years on end by not having the most competent firefighters dealing with emergencies. Its a good measure of how insane have things gotten that Americans are expected to just accept the elites&rsquo; demands that the hurt feelings of a minority who is not keeping up on his own merit take priority over the lives of American families.</p>

		<p><i>The firefighters would receive about $2 million total</i> </p>
<p>This is an anti-White racist settlement.</p>
<p>The firefighters split $2 million yet&hellip;</p>
<p>ONE firefighter in Los Angeles, Rin Tin Tinny Pierce, ate a couple bites of dog food and received a settlement of $3 million from the idiot city council (later reduced to 2.7 million).  Not a bad deal if you can get it!!  I&rsquo;d eat a couple spoonfuls of dogfood for that!  (but then you have to be black to hit the GETO lottery)!</p>
<p>Hell, even Rodney King got $4 million to blast away on drugs, booze, women and gambling&hellip;</p>

<p>Good post about that line, 7-Anonymous. The line would have read better as:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The settlement helps end a seven-year-long legal battle that failed to propel national debate over discrimination against whites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Am I mistaken, did it in fact propel such a debate? I don&rsquo;t watch TV)</p>

		<p>Lesson:  When Whites are discriminated against, they must take their case all the way to the United States Supreme Court and wait 7 years in hopes of receiving $100,000 ($14.5k per year) for their troubles.  When blacks are discriminated against (or have a juvenile prank played on them), local government officials are quick to settle for millions.  No US Supreme Court intervention required.</p>

		<p>the other of the story is the number of unqualified individuals who were hired as a result of this charade. Who can feel comfortable knowing those who respond to a fire, someones home perhaps, cannot operate the fire truck and related equipment? Imagine a child trapped and the &#8220;fire fighter&#8221; just shrugs at the idea of going into the inferno to the child? Political correctness is a road to hell paved in gold!</p>

		<p>Such damages would have been an outrage if the aggrieved parties were black or Hispanic. In fact, isn&rsquo;t our government currently arranging for &#8220;black farmers&#8221; to receive millions in damages because they were apparently &#8220;discriminated&#8221; against?</p>
<p>Two million isn&rsquo;t justice; it&rsquo;s an insult, especially considering illegal invaders from Mexico routinely receive similar amounts when their so called &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; are alleged to have been violated while breaking into our country. <br>

		<p>Two million for the firefighters and 3million for the lawyers, is an insult and a violation of the civil rights of Whites, because lawsuits pay more to minorities. This is unfair treatment!</p>
