			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, July 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As the lethal injection began taking effect, the Mexican National convicted of the brutal rape and killing of a teenage girl in 1995 shouted, &#8220;Viva Mexico!&#8221; just before he died at a Texas prison. </p>
<p>Efforts by Humberto Leal&rsquo;s attorneys to halt the execution fell short, with the U.S. Supreme Court turning back a stay request and Texas Gov. Rick Perry refusing to grant a pardon. He was pronounced dead at 6:21 p.m. local time.</p>
<p>In his last minutes, Leal repeatedly said he was sorry and accepted responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have hurt a lot of people&hellip; .   I take full blame for everything. I am sorry for what I did,&#8221; he said in the death chamber.</p>
<p> &#8220;One more thing,&#8221; he said as the drugs began taking effect. Then he shouted twice, &#8220;Viva Mexico!&#8221; at a Texas prison. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Leal, who moved to the U.S. as a toddler, contended police never told him he could seek legal assistance from the Mexican government under the treaty  &mdash;  and that such assistance would have helped his defense.</p>
<p>Details of the murder were particularly gruesome.</p>
<p>Adria Sauceda, 16, his victim, was found naked by authorities, according to court documents.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a 30- to 40-pound asphalt rock roughly twice the size of the victim&rsquo;s skull lying partially on the victim&rsquo;s left arm,&#8221; court documents read. &#8220;Blood was underneath this rock. A smaller rock with blood on it was located near the victim&rsquo;s right thigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>A &#8220;bloody and broken&#8221; stick roughly 15 inches long with a screw at the end of it was also protruding from the girl&rsquo;s vagina, according to the documents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last Friday, the Obama administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop Texas from executing Leal, asking the court to delay the execution for up to six months to give Congress time to consider legislation that would enforce the U.N. treaty.</p>

		<p>According to news articles I&rsquo;ve read, he claimed to be a U S citizen when arrested. Only when he learned he may be eligible for being spared the death penalty as a Mexican citizen, he revealed the truth. He got what he deserved, and I am so happy the state of Texas refused Obama&rsquo;s efforts to save him.</p>
<p>What is Obama doing in his efforts to &#8220;control&#8221; everything that involves justice in this country? It&rsquo;s painfully obvious he does not have the best interests of our people at heart. It&rsquo;s time for real &#8220;Change&#8221;.</p>

		<p>How would the police have known to advise him to seek legal assistance from  the Mexican government? I thought it was illegal for police (or teachers or welfare case workers or landlords or employers) to inquire as to a person&rsquo;s status as a legal resident in this country? Are we supposed to read minds or what?</p>

		<p>Me-hico doesnt have the death penalty for anyone, including serial killers.The penalty for a lot of other violent, non lethal crimes is less than it was in the US in the 1960s.Maybe that is why their murder rate is 3 times what ours is, even excluding blacks.The ineptitude of their law enforcement agencies is also a large factor.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see how any self-respecting Mexican citizen could find any patriotic pride in this childrapist/childkiller shouting &#8220;Viva Mexico!&#8221;. If Jeffrey Dahmer would have lived long enough to go to the gas chamber and shouted &#8216;USA! USA!, I would&rsquo;ve told him to &#8221; shut up and die, maggot.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet there are quite a few decent Mexicans south of the border raising a tequila in a salute to Texas, saying &#8220;Muy bueno, Gringos.&#8221;</p>

<p>No wonder he&rsquo;s so proud of his country of birth.  It&rsquo;s corrupt to its very core with 80% of officials and police on cartel payroll; it can&rsquo;t provide jobs for its natives so they have to sneak into the US; it is the wealthiest nation in Central and South America, yet it&rsquo;s so backward and undeveloped it&rsquo;s at an abysmal third world level, but, most of all, the officials would have killed him on the spot rather than bring him to trial for such a heinous crime.</p>
<p>He should have said, &#8220;Viva Mexico!  I&rsquo;m proud to be stupid!&#8221;</p>

<p>One BIG difference: Frank and Sacco and Vanzetti were almost certainly not guilty of the crimes they were lynched and/or executed for. This one was clearly, admittedly guilty of an atrocious crime. </p>

		<p>Fr. John #7, I also thought of spies like the Rosenbergs.  <br>
I asked my husband, who watches a lot of TV news, if anyone mentioned the Mexican&rsquo;s shout.  As I figured, no one did (at least that he heard).  I told him that if some white foreigner  &mdash;  say a Russian spy  &mdash;  had shouted &#8220;God bless the Motherland!&#8221; it would have led above the fold in the NYT and been mentioned ad nauseum on every TV newscast.<br>
The Mexican&rsquo;s words were even worse given that he was raised in this country.  Obviously, his parents taught him to love another nation than this one.</p>

<p><i>btw, gringos, is an anti White term.</i></p>
<p>Yes. Consider it nothing but.  Resisting Defamation defines it thusly:</p>
<p><i>Gringo - This label is a claim to supremacy over, and an act of bullying, white Euro-Americans by claiming the right to name and label them; an expression of hatred; a targeting term for violence; and an attempt to smother white American diversity and nationality. This was an important signifying slur during the huge Mexican separatist May Day marches on 5/1/06.</i></p>

<p>What planet are you living on? I guess the term &#8220;decent mexicans&#8221; would exclude the entire mexican government, given the fact they tried everything possible to spare him from the death sentence being carried out! The fact this invader was a convicted murder and rapist seems to be lost on these people! Is that your idea of &ldquo;decency?&rdquo;</p>
<p> And why would we acknowledge anyone who refers to us as &#8220;gringos?&#8221; Just like mexicans to insult the hand that feeds them!<br>

<p>Well, this is correct. I guess that he had the appearance and sounded as your average-everyday person and not really was the type you ask questions about your immigration status, etc. The police were not at fault here and ONLY much afterwards did he start demanding his &#8220;rights&#8221;.<br>

<p> Yeah, one last dig at the hated &#8220;gringo&#8221;! I wonder how much of the taxpayers money it took to raise this Mexican since he came here as a &#8220;toddler&#8221;. The sad part is that there are thousands more of them just like him in this country that have an intense hatred for Whites and this country that we are forced to pay for. We are literately paying these people to come here to disrespect us and our country and are buying the rope that&rsquo;s going to hang us. </p>

Apparently,the killer was watching too many classic American cartoons and reeling from funny cigarette withdrawl.</p>
<p>If Fox news was not a front for liberalism, they could summon the ambition to take tabs on the progress government isnt making in closing our border instead of exploiting the invasion to fish for puff piece news.</p>

		<p>At least Perry did not cowtail to the machinations of Obama and others.  This was just a simple Mexican thug who deserved the death penalty.  Why does the Mexican gov&rsquo;t even care when thousands are being killed every day?  Of course, this is a rhetorical question, but this is just another demonstration of what is and what is not American.</p>

		<p>Even now I wipe a tear from my eye the story of JOSE ANTONIO VARGAS flows from the New York Times web site. </p>
<p>Vargas grew up in America without the benefit of citizenship. The ordeals he endured pull on our heartstrings and gently manipulate one&rsquo;s malleable mind towards surrender to the invasion of hordes of illegal aliens from south of the border.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s an electrical surge. My computer blinks off; then on again. What was that? Someone fried in the electric chair?</p>
<p>The story on the computer screen has changed. Apparently the ghosts of our nation&rsquo;s founders were tinkering with its innards. </p>
<p>Now the image of Humberto Leal dominates the screen. My mind returns to its natural form as I read of the 16-year-old girl he had murdered. Young Adria Sauceda was found naked.</p>
<p>Like Vargas, Leal was an alien raised in the United States. Unlike Vargas, the national media has chosen not to puff his story; it doesn&rsquo;t comply with the MSM agenda of advancing multiculturalism. It is simply too honest, too straight forward; too reflective of reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the victim of Leal: &ldquo;There was a 30- to 40-pound asphalt rock roughly twice the size of the victim&rsquo;s skull lying partially on the victim&rsquo;s left arm,&rdquo; court documents read. &ldquo;Blood was underneath this rock. A smaller rock with blood on it was located near the victim&rsquo;s right thigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His life as an undocumented immigrant was a life of crime.</p>
<p>As Vargas died of lethal injection in a Texas prison, his final words were, &ldquo;Viva Mexico!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A &ldquo;bloody and broken&rdquo; stick roughly 15 inches long with a screw at the end of it was also protruding from the girl&rsquo;s vagina, according to the documents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Viva Mexico!&rdquo; indeed.</p>

<p>Steve Sailer made a good point about that Vargas.  One of the practical reasons the MSM doesn&rsquo;t get worked up over illegal immigration is because there are so few Hispanic illegal aliens who can write well that illegal Hispanic immigration isn&rsquo;t a threat to their jobs.  In fact, the language skills of many Hispanics is so bad that a few years ago, the Virginia Health Department used something called a &#8220;fotonovela&#8221; (basically a simple picture book) to warn the state&rsquo;s growing Hispanic population about statutory rape laws.</p>

		<p>This may sound cruel but I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that it really doesn&rsquo;t effect me when I read about non-Europeans killing and destroying other non-Europeans. The bombings in the Middle East, tribal massacres in Africa, decapitations and mass graves in Mexico as well as the urban savagery in the U.S. I just don&rsquo;t care anymore if these people want to kill each other. I guess I&rsquo;ve reached the point of complete and total saturation with thier barbarity. Sad I guess&hellip; </p>

		<p>I note the name of the girl this criminal murdered, seems to be hispanic. Did the hispanic community (parents and neighbors) get up in arms about him murdering her or were they more upset that the Texas government was gonna execute him? I say that the first moment he hurt this girl, his &#8220;rights&#8221; were instantly voided. I agree with another poster here, Mexican citizens are free to feel, say and do what they want in their country, if they want to cheer that we executed a brutal child murderer, please allow them to do so.</p>

		<p>This case should serve as a good example of why the Dream Act, amnesty, and Obama administration policies are not good for this country. First, these people simply do not assimilate into American culture and never lose their loyalty to Mexico. I have seen persons of Mexican decent who are citizens-and doing quite well economically salute the president of Mexico on state visits while at the same time denigrating all things American. Especially when it involves the traditional values of Natural Born Generational Americans. Second, I lived in Houston during the early stages of the Mexican invasion. Mexican men preyed on young prepubescent girls, and young women in their early teens at an alarming rate. They were quick to anger and had no qualms about knifing a person for the most trivial of reasons. Not only does one have to wonder how many cold cases involving rape and murder are on file at HPD, but also haw many bodies of young women are buried in the rural deserts of Mexico. Leal Garcia&rsquo;s problem is that, unlike the unsophisticated corrupt administration in his own country, he just happened to commit his crime in a country with a very sophisticated law enforcement establishment, and since he wasn&rsquo;t experienced enough to escape prosecution by fleeing back across the border he got caught and experienced Texas justice. Albeit, somewhat protracted and restrained by those enlightened bureaucrats in DC. Worth noting is the supreme court decision that snubbed Obama and  Calderon and paved the way for justice to be served. Of particular note were the dissenters to Justice Scalia&rsquo;s decision two of them are Obama appointees to the court. You can read it at: https://goo.gl/SyZre.       </p>

		<p>The Hispanic community is like the black community in that they are more upset that a hispanic or black will be executed than the fact they were a violent criminal. Remember how outraged lots of blacks got with Tookie Williams?</p>

		<p>#5 He is not a child rapist, he is Mexican. Age of consent in most Mexican states is 12 including Mexico City, quite a few states have the age of consent as puberty - when they bleed they breed.<br>
So when you read about the Mexican with his 12 year old pregnant girlfriend, its not child abuse, its just another wonderful facet of multiculturalism at its peak.</p>

<p>This may sound cruel but I&rsquo;ve gotten to the point that it really doesn&rsquo;t effect me when I read about non-Europeans killing and destroying other non-Europeans. The bombings in the Middle East, tribal massacres in Africa, decapitations and mass graves in Mexico as well as the urban savagery in the U.S. I just don&rsquo;t care anymore if these people want to kill each other. I guess I&rsquo;ve reached the point of complete and total saturation with thier barbarity. Sad I guess&hellip; <br>

<p>NO, it is not sad&hellip;.wish more felt like you do. I don&rsquo;t care about what non-Europeans do to each other either. Never have. They most assuredly do not care one whit about White people as we can all see. </p>
<p>I also do not care about THEIR abortion rates as so many Whites and Christians seem to fret about.</p>

		<p>At comment number 28, don&rsquo;t assume that all nonwhites &#8220;don&rsquo;t care about white people&#8221;  I am a person of color with skin darker than most african americans and I admire and respect whites. I am hoping that if whites finally do &#8220;wake up&#8221; that I can be accepted as an honorary white</p>
