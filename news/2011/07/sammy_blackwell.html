<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Oklahoma, A woman who looks like Casey Anthony has been attacked. Sammy Blackwell was driving home when a crazed lunatic crashed into her car causing it to flip with her inside it.</p>
<p>An African-American woman named Shireen Nalley came into the store Blackwell worked at around 10pm to buy gas. It was the end of Blackwell&rsquo;s shift and she was going home. While Nalley was in the store she told Blackwell &#8220;you look like Casey Anthony.&#8221;</p>
<p>A half an hour passed by and Nalley was waiting outside for Blackwell. That&rsquo;s when Blackwell noticed Nalley was watching her from her minivan as she got into her truck. After Blackwell left, Nalley followed her. Nalley rammed Blackwell&rsquo;s car twice. The second collision flipped Blackwell&rsquo;s truck almost three times.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;crazed lunatic&#8221; attacker was an African-American woman. Maybe to some African-Americans, &#8220;all whites look alike&#8221; just like many of them do to us. That being said, the victim sure doesn&rsquo;t look like Casey Anthony in any way other than they are both white females&hellip;</p>

		<p>These photos don&rsquo;t look ANYTHING alike.  It figures, a black woman brilliantly ass-u-me-ed it was Casey Anthony when C.A. was still in jail.  That alone indicates supreme stupidity to me.  Additionally, who made this dimwit judge and jury over ANYBODY?  I believe the court found Anthony not guilty, and the authority rests with them, not with some ignorant black woman who decided to take the law into her own hands.  I hope they put Ms. DumbasaPost in jail for a long time.  That kind of stupid doesn&rsquo;t need to be loose on the streets.</p>

Unlike OJ, blacks firmly believe Casey Anthony is guilty and got away with murder.</p>

		<p>During the endless blathering about this case only one pontificator said anything sensible.  It was, of all people Geraldo Rivera.  &#8220;If this were a black or latina Mother on the wrong side of town there would be only a few stories in the local papers.  No one out of town would have ever heard of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Casey Anthony, whatever she did to her daughter was publicized for only one reason.  She is White.  The media barely mentions black, hispanic, asian and middle eastern children killed by their parents.  But find a White accused and it is all over the news for years.  Who were the most vociferious against her?  Nazi Grace and the female crew at Fox news.  </p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe Judge Pirro and the rest of the criminal attorneys screeching away that she got a tattoo therefore she killed her child.</p>
<p>There is a lot of evidence against Casey.  There was no evidence against the Duke rape 3.  The media campaigned against all of them for one reason and one reason only.  They are all White.</p>
<p>Remember it was the media that did not just edit, but totally re-created the Rodney King tape and showed it all over the news for months.  Then when the officers were aquitted the media massively campaigned to violate the 14th amendment by charging them again in which trial they were convicted. </p>
<p>Every year thousands of black children are killed either by murder or neglect by their mothers and mothers boyfriends.  Sometimes it will be mentioned in 2 paragraphs for a day.</p>
<p>But a White woman whose child dies so mysteriously must be guilty of first degree murder because she got a tattoo.  </p>
<p>This kind of thing is just one more part of the propaganda designed to bring about the genocide of White Americans.</p>
<p>BTW I only watched it the last few days.  I must say that the black Judge was no affirmative action hire.  He was absolutely the very model of the ideal Judge.  Were I President Obama I&rsquo;d fast track him to the federal Judiciary and if possible to the supreme court.</p>
<p>There is a Judicial conference.  Newly appointed Judges undergo a training program.  They should show videos of that Judge at all their continuing education events.</p>

		<p>It was probably just an excuse to attack a White person.  Similiar to &#8220;I thought she was looking at me.&#8221;  &#8220;I had a flashback to slavery and she looked like my mean old owner&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh, that slavery flashback defense was used quite a bit from 1960 to 1990.  </p>

		<p>This woman was lying in wait for close to a half hour waiting for her opportunity to kill this woman. This was a premeditated attempted murder! I hope this mandrill is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.</p>

		<p>I have to wonder whether this dumb perp thought the victim was actually Anthony or whether she hated her because she believed she merely looks like Anthony  &mdash;  in other words, just didn&rsquo;t like her looks!  Blacks often attack white strangers for basically the same reason  &mdash;  because they&rsquo;re pretty, have &#8220;good&#8221; hair, or just because they&rsquo;re white.</p>

<p>This seems to be a sort of Orwellian &#8220;2 minutes of hate&#8221; (politically correct hate against a White scapegoat) that American culture and media is normalising.</p>

		<p>Rather interesting since when would a black female care about what a white mother did to her white child? And then take it upon herself to &#8216;get her&rsquo; on behalf of the child? If anything wouldnt she be happy that there was one less white child in the world regardless if the mom killed her? </p>

		<p>Soooo can this be labeled as a hate crime? <br>
I would have to say that it is and should be treated as so.<br>
Even though most of America is in an uproar (and probably hate Casey also )over the verdict a sensible person knows that whether or not justice was done it was the jurys decision to let her go and we are supposed to respect it once its done.<br>
Imagine if White people had attacked anyone resembling O.J. (anyone black) after that debacle and claimed it was because they looked alike, instant hate crime and multiple MSM reporting it.<br>
This poor woman looks nothing like Casey Anthony.</p>

		<p>Well, this is understandable to a degree - after all, we know what famously loving, caring, doting, and nurturing parents most blacks are, hence the outrage that this white woman dared to (supposedly)look like Anthony.</p>

		<p>Another black psycho at work. They are definitely deficient in any sort of rationale. For the most part, this black psycho is just another White hater. You wouldn&rsquo;t see her attacking a BLACK woman who did the same thing as C.A&hellip;</p>

		<p>Among the crowds protesting the CA verdict I notice there are many blacks, some of whom can&rsquo;t wait to voice their disapproval of the verdict in front of a microphone. I wonder how many of these concerned black citizens were celebrating when OJ was acquitted.</p>

<p>He said that about the disappearance of Elizabeth Smart as well. His motivation was not to defend Whites.  He was saying that she got attention because she was a pretty young White girl.</p>
<p>Geraldo is always touting his Hispanic heritage although I&rsquo;ve heard him trying to speak Spanish and he sucks. He identifies with the poor and downtrodden from his house (if I&rsquo;m not mistaken) on the banks of the Hudson.</p>
<p>As for that Black woman, I haven&rsquo;t seen her picture yet so as to maintain a degree of impartiality. If Blacks were so shocked by this case, where is the outrage when a Black &#8220;mother&#8221; kills her infant, sticks his corpse in a backpack and goes shopping?  Where&rsquo;s the outrage when every day we hear stories about Laqueesha&rsquo;s &#8220;bawfrayn&#8221; not da baby daddy, who&rsquo;s left in charge of Laqueesha&rsquo;s baby whom &#8220;da bawfrayn&#8221; throws against the wall cause he/she is crying and stomps on him/her when he/she has hit the floor?</p>
<p>For this person it was just an excuse to attack another White person.<br>

		<p>Even though I agree that it is a shame that this child died and no clear end was seen to that trial, I also see an over-indulgence in it by many.  I think any psychologist could make the diagnosis; some sort of social neurosis that verges on psychosis.</p>
<p>It also could be an indicator of how fragile the American psyche is at this point.  (By &#8220;American&#8221; I do mean everyone, this time).</p>
