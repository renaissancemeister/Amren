<h1>Hundreds Scramble for Dallas County Rental Vouchers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cynthia Vega and Rebecca Lopez, WFAA (Dallas), July 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least eight people were hurt Thursday morning while scrambling to line up for a limited number of Dallas County rental vouchers  &mdash;  after waiting for hours in their cars.</p>
<p>People lined up Thursday morning to apply for Dallas County Section 8 housing vouchers. Dallas County sheriff&rsquo;s spokesman Kim Leach estimated the crowd at about 5,000.</p>
<p>The office at the Jesse Owens Memorial Complex wasn&rsquo;t supposed to open until 8 a.m., but some applicants started lining up at 10 o&rsquo;clock Wednesday night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Doors were opened early.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people rushed the line, causing moments of unruliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started running and I slipped and fell,&#8221; said applicant Jordan Spivey, who suffered cuts and scrapes as she was caught up in the crowd. But she said she feels lucky that she wasn&rsquo;t trampled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a madhouse,&#8221; said applicant Ada McKinsey, who was injured as the crowd closed in around the door. &#8220;People pushing, fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>But authorities eventually gained control.</p>
<p>Seven people were treated by paramedics. None were taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Health officials said they processed 4,000 to 5,000 applicants on Thursday morning, adding that as many as 15,000 could ask to be put on a list with only 3,800 vouchers available over the next few years.</p>

		<p>I want everyone to notice how these &#8220;people&#8221; are dressed. The one black lady who complained of her arm having white stuff all over it was dressed nicely with perfect hair. The lone white in the video was wearing a ratty t-shirt and mentioned working 3 jobs and needed help so she could go back to school. Those $150 Air Jordans came in handy when the gates opened. The future of America looks bleek.</p>

		<p>People were racing on foot to get into a state office building named after Jesse Owens.  Amusing, even ironic, if you want.  Would many of these people lining up at 4 AM and racing each other to get a free welfare goody at 5:30 AM be so fleet of foot if that which was offered was a well paying job?  </p>
<p>I noticed the young white woman who said that her three jobs wasn&rsquo;t enough for her to afford rent.  If you want to believe that she&rsquo;s telling the truth, and I do, you should file this very prominently in your memory bank before you get the notion to vote for Rick Perry for President.  Most of Texas&rsquo;s vaunted &#8220;job growth&#8221; is in minimum wage and sub-minimum wage employment, and of those Texans that are working, their wage growth through the worst of the recession years has been almost zero, and far lower than the national average.  If you didn&rsquo;t know Texas was on the Mexican border, those would be obvious indicators that Texas&rsquo;s Hispanic population is growing.</p>

		<p>Aren&rsquo;t they concerned over at the welfare office about inclusion and fairness most of all? Aren&rsquo;t they doing all they can to make things right and bring about inclusion. Why are there so few whites given section 8, food stamps, job retraining, housing subsidies, medicaid benefits? Are their no poor whites anywhere in Dallas and in Texas? Musnt everything be equal, no matter the cost or effort? Seems like where they are Most concerned about discrimination is where they practice it the most without shame. </p>

		<p> Yes, the crowd looked pretty dark to me. If there were any White people in it, they must have &#8220;blacked up&#8221; beforehand because they were starring in a minstrel show later.</p>
<p> And by the way, was anyone else struck by the fact that so many of these &#8220;poor&#8221; people drove up in their own vehicles to wait for 6 a.m.? Bet they had plenty of cigarettes and Colt .45 in those cars, too.</p>

		<p>I saw this on one of the MSM &#8216;news&rsquo; shows this evening, and noticed that they were merely rambling on the state of America in general, but the next video clip they showed was a long -mostly caucasian- line of people waiting calmly for job openings. The difference was -literally- night and day between the two crowds. The only surprise was that they would dare to be so &#8216;racist&rsquo; as to put both videos up within the same segment. </p>

		<p>White people can&rsquo;t get section 8 housing vouchers. My brother-in-law lost his job. After months of fruitless searching for other employment, he, my sister and their 14-year-old son ended up homeless and living in their car in the dead of winter. They relocated to the town where I live and stayed with my husband and I for several months, until both adults got jobs and saved enough to get their own apt. </p>

		<p>I live in Poland, formerly having lived in America.  The more I think about the crises that has enveloped the USA, the more alarmed I become.  The masses of people seem to be headed for brutishness.  You are being overwhelmed externally, by massive immigration and internally, by creating your own barbarians.  Both of these are destroying civilzation.  I don&rsquo;t know what can be done to save what&rsquo;s left of civilzation. Maybe some type of monasticism, although secular, to save whatever can be saved of the past for an eventual renaissance, however many hundreds of years away that may be&hellip;</p>

		<p>It looks so much like Africa&hellip;mayhem, no dignity.<br>
It could so easily spill over into total violence. <br>
If it were Africa, without some semblance of white rule, it would have.<br>
More and more, everywhere DOES resemble Africa, as white ways and people recede, and Blacks proliferate, spreading to every corner of the country.<br>
Another gift of the Mexodus- pushing blacks into the once white areas.<br>
I see so many blacks who arrive every day here in Colorado Springs. But the Mestizos are already here in a horde.<br>

		<p>Ba ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!! I usually get aggravated by reading these news items about how Africans are taking advantage of the system and destroying our society, but this one (the video) was absolutely hilarious. They did their hero Jesse Owens proud indeed! </p>
<p>Poster number 5, WASP, your comments about the racism of expecting whites to outrun blacks had me rolling on the floor. A much needed moment of levity on this site! Ha Ha!!!</p>
<p>But in another interview from a female black reporter named &#8220;Tacoma Perry&#8221; (on the &#8220;Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like&#8221; webpage), she had the nerve to insinuate that the riot was provoked by workers who administered the voucher program (a white woman was aggressively questioned as to their plan for handing out applications and why they had not planned for the crowds.) </p>
<p>Ms Tacoma went on to flatly state that those distributing the section 8 housing applications created the chaos!!!! In other words, the feral majority black crowd is not responsible for the bedlam they engaged in. Now I&rsquo;m no longer amused. Can I use a bad word on this site??????</p>

		<p>I had to google &#8216;section 8&rsquo; to discover what it is. Wikipedia gives a detailed explanation. In UK, we have a similar system whereby Social Services pay private landlords a maximum proportion of rent on behalf of tenants. However, this is done on a case-by-case basis and in conjuction with other social financial needs supported by a written application and a face-to-face interview, certainly not by advertising that applicants have to mill around in their thousands just to pick up an application form. I note that many complaints were about lack of parking facilities and many said they camped overnight in their cars waiting for the doors to open. I can assure Americans that ownership of a car in UK would probably disqualify most residents from reciept of housing welfare benefits as the attitude would be that work is probably available within driving distance so go out and find it.  BTW it is interesting to note that a gallon of 95 unleaded in America is around $2.25 whilst in UK it would cost around $7.00. The cost of car ownership over here is horrendous. Anyway, surely the social services office in Dallas are already aware of those in genuine need of housing assistance and could quite easily assign financial help as and when it arises. I await the deluge of complaints about this post!!</p>

		<p>Let me make sure I understand this.  In order to qualify for government assisted housing payments, you&rsquo;ve got to sprint across a huge parking lot, at dawn, with thousands of other people, to a building called the Jesse Owens Memorial Complex.</p>
<p>This is made up right?  The film is fake?  We have actually reached this point?</p>

<p>The ONLY people who should be eligible for rent vouchers in a SANE America are the WHITE elderly and the WHITE disabled/veterans.</p>
<p> I know that after working 35 years and paying into the system my SSA barely covers my rent and pge. I don&rsquo;t even apply because I have seen these section 8 apt. complexes full of blacks and mexicans and all their gang homies living off section 8. </p>
<p>As an older WHITE lady I would surely be assaulted, car stolen, home invaded, etc. if I had to live among them. No thanks, I will stay where I have lived for the last 11 years and keep my body and mind intact.</p>
<p>Did you know that even ILLEGAL Mexicans get Section 8?  Well, they sure do, plus they are now getting FREE college tuition paid for by us.</p>

		<p>To poster #17:  I am also an older white lady, and I receive a Section 8 housing voucher.  In the olden days, housing assistance meant that you had to live in the &#8220;projects,&#8221; but these days, you can &#8220;spend&#8221; your voucher on any suitable housing where the landlord will cooperate.  I live in an all-white, scrupulously maintained apartment complex in a town that is that is 97% white.  </p>
<p>The housing program is stupid in that people who are eligible have to wait years to have their name come up on a waiting list.  Once they actually get their voucher, they often lose the motivation to better their own situation, since doing so would cause the loss of the voucher.  (In other words, you don&rsquo;t get the full benefit of getting a better job by completing your education, and you don&rsquo;t get the full benefit of working more hours, because the amount of your voucher is reduced as your income rises.  And if your income rises enough, your voucher is taken away entirely, and you have to reapply from the bottom of the waiting list if your financial situation deteriorates again.)  HUD housing is NOT a program that would help out somebody whose house burned down, or somebody getting divorced.  By the time your name comes up on a list, your &#8220;crisis&#8221; will be long over.</p>
<p>For those of you who have relatives who are out of work, or who need to go back to finish school, the waiting list for a voucher is MUCH, MUCH shorter in all-white, small town areas than it is in large multi-culti cities.  </p>
<p>HUD housing has a lot of built-in stupidities.  If you are living in a high-cost area and out of work and receiving a huge voucher (because the size of the voucher is based on your income AND the cost of the average rental apartment in your area) you lose all incentive to re-locate.  If you can keep your voucher for a lifetime (and you can!) you have no incentive to work and save to buy a house.  </p>
<p>HUD runs a lot of programs to help people purchase houses, etc., that don&rsquo;t make a lot of sense now that house prices are dropping.  Sooner or later, the government may have to cut back on these programs due to financial constraints. <br>

<p>At my (inner-city) library, there&rsquo;s a one-hour-a-day limit on public computer use. Can&rsquo;t waste time filling out applications when you&rsquo;ve only got 60 minutes for Facebooking, playing games and/or watching hip-hop videos.</p>
