<h1><a href="http://www.mysinchew.com/node/61131">White South African Farmers Seek New Life in Georgia</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Irakli Metreveli, My Sinchew, July 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A long way from his South African birthplace, amid the sweeping wheat fields of eastern Georgia, farmer Piet Kemp says that he has found a new home in this former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>And if the government gets its wish, hundreds more like Kemp will follow to help revive Georgia&rsquo;s ailing agricultural sector, bringing in both cash and expertise.</p>
<p>Shaken by violent attacks and reforms to transfer land to blacks in South Africa, many white farmers have been emigrating, and 10 have already relocated to Georgia to set up businesses under a programme launched by the government.</p>
<p>Kemp was the first of them to make the move, lured by local business opportunities  &mdash;  and the promise of security.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not want to live in constant fear,&#8221; the 67-year-old said emotionally as he recalled the widespread killings of other white farmers in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to defend our rights, but we lost this war.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the apartheid system ended in 1994, 87 per cent of commercial farms belonged to the white minority, including Boers like Kemp, descendants of Dutch settlers who arrived in South Africa in the 17th century.</p>
<p>Discontent grew among Boers after the government started to redistribute farmlands in an attempt to counter apartheid-era discrimination.</p>
<p>Amid the violence, Kemp said that he felt he had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Georgia there is no violence, the crime rate is extremely low. So I will never go back,&#8221; Kemp declared, comparing the situation here to the high violent crime rates back home, which include some 46 murders a day.</p>
<p>He sold his farm in South Africa&rsquo;s Mpumalanga province, was given Georgian citizenship and in March this year rented 700 hectares (1,730 acres) of land in the village of Sartichala, where he now cultivates maize and wheat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I moved to Georgia because I see tremendous opportunities here  &mdash;  there is a good climate, fertile soil and a good market,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Georgian Diaspora Minister Mirza Davitaia, who is in charge of the scheme, said &#8220;it is a very important investment initiative.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Serious capital will be invested in Georgia&rsquo;s agricultural sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>South African farmers, he said, &#8220;will bring in their skills, experience and technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>A website, www.boers.ge, was set up to attract interest, and Davitaia said he believed that the 10 South African farmers who have already moved to Georgia will be followed by hundreds of other Boers.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  &#8216;Country going to waste&rsquo;  &mdash;  </p>
<p>But near Kemp&rsquo;s land in the village of Sartichala, some Georgian farmers said that the authorities should be supporting them ahead of foreign immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing against Boers, but our government should first care about its citizens. Georgian villages, Georgian agriculture and Georgian peasants have been neglected for decades,&#8221; said one of them, Tengo Paatashvili.</p>
<p>Others said however that they would be grateful for any help in revitalising the country&rsquo;s agricultural sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever comes to Georgia with good intentions is welcome. There is plenty of land in the country that is going to waste,&#8221; said farmer Lado Aladashvili.</p>
<p>The authorities need all the help they can get, because although Georgian land is incredibly fertile and a large proportion of its population works in agriculture, more than 80 per cent of foodstuffs are imported, fuelling drastic food-price inflation.</p>
<p>Georgia was once one of the larders of the Soviet Union, renowned for its citrus fruits, grapes, nuts and tea, but the amount of cultivated land has diminished by 43 per cent over the last seven years.</p>
<p>A hasty privatisation programme after independence in the 1990s aided the decline, when small plots of state-owned land were handed to millions of farmers, saving them from starvation but creating an inefficient subsistence farming system.</p>
<p>&#8220;Georgia has real potential to become a net exporter of agricultural products: fruits, vegetables, meat and cattle,&#8221; said agriculture expert David Shervashidze.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main challenge is the lack of funds, both domestic and foreign investments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili called for large-scale modernisation to turn the country&rsquo;s &#8220;mediaeval agriculture sector into the agriculture of the 21st century&#8221; and make it a major source of income.</p>
<p>The plan to attract Boer farmers to relocate to this distant ex-Soviet state is part of Saakashvili&rsquo;s vision, but although their numbers may turn out to be small, they could make a difference, expert Shervashidze suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the world&rsquo;s best farmers. They bring in cash, create new jobs and set up efficient businesses,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>At his new farm in Sartichala, Kemp is now getting ready for his family to rejoin him.</p>
<p>He has made friends with locals, is learning the Georgian language and is even thinking of converting to the national religion, Orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to Georgia to be a Georgian,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Good for Georgia and good for the farmers taking this opportunity.  Leave Africa to sink of swim on its own.  I think aside from African politicians/warlords/demagogues, even every day Africans don&rsquo;t want the whites to leave.  After all, they like eating and low crime rates too.</p>

		<p>I hope this becomes a trend and other countries offer white South Africans asylum. It makes perfect sense that a country wishing to strengthen its agriculture, should bring people in who know what they are doing. Whites should leave South Africa as soon as possible because South Africa is hellbent on destroying itself. </p>

<p>No, leftists wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased with that at all. Almost all white immigration would be &#8216;racist&rsquo; and would be a practice that would have to be stopped. Purely for humanitarian reasons. And we&rsquo;d have to apologize forever and ever. This is a fact, actually, not a theory.</p>
<p>But immigration that is almost entirely people of color, that&rsquo;s the embodiment of a &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, which must be welcomed and celebrated. In which case being against &#8216;immigration&rsquo; (and being driven out of your town/neighborhood) that would be racism on the part of anyone who dared speak up. FOX news, those champions of the white race, they would be the one&rsquo;s who deal in &#8216;bias&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>A word of caution.</p>
<p>I just hope these farmers are aware of the underlying political currents in Georgia. It was not too long ago that there was a war between Georgia and Russia, with some questionable people backing Georgia and this could happen again if those tensions were not resolved back then.</p>
<p>If a war breaks out, or some other major political event, where will the farmers side themselves? And more important, their children (younger, militarily eligible)?</p>
<p>Furthermore is there a future for the children of these farmers in Georgia? These children will look for a mate and where will that be? Obviously inside the available pool of Georgians. For as far as I understand it, the Georgians are an unique race and not of similar stock than the Boers (West-European). What kind of new product will come out of the fraternization between the Boer and the Georgian? It will have to be tested against the practical reality if this will work. If it was Georgia in the USA I would have less of a concern, it basically is the same stock.  </p>
<p>Should they decide to isolate themselves from these decisions, it will certainly create certain tensions between the Georgians and the Boers and then they will have to start all over again. In this case their solution was at best only a temporary solution.</p>
<p>In short - the success of this venture still has to be tested against the reality. Let us hope the best for them.</p>

		<p>Finally a white government making <i>sane</i> policy. Agree with poster 13 that it&rsquo;s too bad this is not our Georgia.  I doubt that South African farmers could even get a tourist visa to the states, much less settle permanently and add productivity to the economy. No&hellip;..absolutely not. We prefer Somalis.  They add so much more.</p>
<p>When the country of Georgia has its farm production up and running to major export levels, the UN will demand a &#8220;just&#8221; portion of the products be given to starving Africans.    </p>

		<p>Black on white violence in Africa isn&rsquo;t well-known in this country, but the many write in forums tell us black on white attacks are well-known here.</p>
<p>As I said many times, either the leftist forums are loosening up their restrictions on talking about race, or white people are finally waking up, but whatever it is whites are finally getting up in arms against blacks.  What they are saying is much more than what we say here on Amren.</p>

<p>Whites actually have more of a claim to South Africa than blacks ever will. That part of Africa was uninhabited when the first white settlers came in by a mere accident because their ship sank. Before that, the cape was deemed unlivable.</p>
<p>Whites made that land arable, thus attracting the farther north living black populace. Only when whites made South Africa a livable and desirable place, blacks flocked there to enjoy the prosperity brought on by whites.</p>

		<p> Georgia is certainly an improvement over Africa. As far as becoming &#8220;Georgian&#8221; - easier said than done [history,unique alphabet, language is an isolate, rough &#8216;hood etc].</p>
<p> Australia is letting in the largest number of white South Africans but only with an education. To any Afrikaners that may be reading - imo - use Georgia as a temporary refuge, homeschool [or online,or use Australian textbooks for hard sciences and use informal means to transfer cultural values] your children. Your gene line must be reunited with other Protestant Germanic Europeans to insure that your families can never again be scapegoated. And for god&rsquo;s sake - never again utilize cheap labor.</p>

<p>I think South Africans will integrate into the Georgian community perfectly and be an asset to the nation. Climate could be a little tough at the beginning (since it&rsquo;s mostly cloudy and rainy) but so are the Boers as far as I know. It&rsquo;s a pity that those racist blacks force them to flee. Let them starve in that hellhole. </p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t worry about the future products of Boer-Georgian couples. They wouldn&rsquo;t look much different from Europeans as the host people can easily pass for their cousins in Southern Europe.</p>

<p>The white South Africans/Afrikaners/Boers are a very well educated community.</p>
<p>The only real issue is language<br>
At 60% they are the majority white group in South Africa and for the most part English is a second/foreign language to them<br>
They will not find this difficult to overcome as they will be surrounded by it and becoming fluent very quickly whilst no doubt retaining Afrikaans within the home like Australian Maltese, Greeks and Italians do. </p>

		<p>Today I plan to write to my congressman and ask him to start an initiative that will grant asylum to these oppressed people.  I wish that everyone here would do the same. I don&rsquo;t think that some of the members of Congress are even aware of what&rsquo;s going on there.<br>
AMRENers let&rsquo;s show some White muscle!!</p>

		<p>  In Georgia the Boer farmers will have a real future. It may be difficult, and it is far from ideal, but for them to remain in South Africa would mean either a violent death or their gradual extinction as a people. I wish Holland, Germany or America had extended them a helping hand. However, although these governments may be hostile to White South Africans, the average white citizen is not.  </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t burn the farm before leaving!  Instead, write up a detailed &#8220;farming manual&#8221; for your black employees to follow after you hand over the keys.  The Israelis did this, leaving behind 3000 working greenhouses when they cleared out of Gaza in 2005.  Of course, the Palestinians smashed them all within hours.<br>

		<p>Good for the Boers. I really think they&rsquo;d all be better off getting out of S.A..This article has reminded me of an comment I read about years ago, I can&rsquo;t credit the author because I can&rsquo;t remind who it was. Of course I don&rsquo;t know what the future will bring,but I really do believe that our White race is facing existential danger in the not to distant future. Without becoming too long winded here&hellip;I suggest that we may find ourselves making a last stand in Russia. Now before I first read this Russia was nearly the last place that would come to mind. Now the idea has really grabbed me. Quite frankly no longer care about &#8220;country&#8221; I&rsquo;m American&hellip;that no longer means anything!  What does it mean? People&hellip;..America is gone !  For crying out loud the American President hates white people. Your nation, your flag, your uniform is the color of your skin !</p>

<p>&#8220;European derived whites haven&rsquo;t any more business living in South Africa any more than Somali&rsquo;s, Bantu&rsquo;s or Hmong, have living in places like Minnesota or Maine. Or, any other place on the North American continent come to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read your reply #10, but I still have an issue with your pronouncement on Euros in Africa.  I guess you are saying that the races only belong in their indigenous lands? That taken to its logical end must say that whites also don&rsquo;t belong anywhere but Europe.  Since such racial separation will never happen, then we must look at history.  When the Dutch arrived in SA there were no blacks there.  When whites went to the Orient and other regions, it was for trade and that trade enriched Europe and made our advances possible. The case was even better than when white Europeans arrived in North America.  We were dealing with the indigenous peoples immediately, they were present at out landings.  The Dutch occupied empty land for years before the Zulus arrived.  The only real difference here seems to be that the Dutch Boers and the British were dealing with blacks while we were dealing with non-black indigenous peoples.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Boers will adjust to a wetter climate. What will be really tough at first is the seasonal adjustment. They&rsquo;ve lived all their lives in the southern hemisphere where the seasons are reversed, so they&rsquo;re accustomed to harvesting their crops in March and April. Now they&rsquo;ll have to start doing that in September and October. Also, the weather circulation patterns are the opposite of what they grew up with. I know that if I moved to Australia or New Zealand it would take me awhile to get used to celebrating Christmas in early summer.</p>
<p>My fear is that some of them will get overwhelmingly homesick for the <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/veldt" rel="nofollow">veldt</a> and want to return to SA. I know that sounds as crazy as a white American pining away for Detroit, but I&rsquo;ve read several articles here and elsewhere that document those feelings.</p>

		<p>I wrote to my Congressman today. Please guys write to yours. It&rsquo;s time that the plight of the Boers gets some attention.<br>
Each representative has a direct email link on his/her website. If nothing else we&rsquo;ve got to make White America aware of the horrors that are going in that hellhole of SA,</p>

<p>Canada, the USA, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand have remarkably parallel histories. I specifically exclude Central and South America from this post as I do not know enough about them to make a sensible comment.</p>
<p>In the 5 English speaking new world countries mentioned all the white populations came from Europe and set about building thriving nations in these new territories. the first nations/indigenous peoples were pretty much left alone to continue with their traditional lifestyles and live in parallel to the whites.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference between South Africa and the other 4 is that the white settlers in SA were always a minority. In 1900 the ratio was 1m whites to 3m blacks. In 1990 the figure was 5m whites and 35m blacks.</p>
<p>The USA is now experiencing a similar demographic shift due to legal and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>I am not certain if the US State Govts can set their own immigration policies but if they can they would be wise to offer sanctuary to white South Africans. They would be gaining well educated christian citizens with a good Protestant work ethic. This would be a win-win solution as it would save whites from extinction in SA and boost the numbers in the USA against the rising tide of non white immigration.  </p>

		<p>The breaking up of the Afrikaner/Boer people has one disturbing factor and that is, that the Afrikaans language will not survive. It has been said by some individual that in South Africa the Afrikaans language is the language of the poets whereas English is the language of the JSE (Johannesburg Stock Exchange). The destruction of the Afrikaner/Boer people is dream wished by Milner and his English followers. What Milner started to achieve, has now almost been fullfilled by the black government. It has been said that it was after all the Afrikaner/Boer who bled for this country and definitely not the English who settled here.</p>

		<p>I am glad to hear that Georgia has welcomed South-African farmers, but it also is sad. Sad because their language will die out, and they will eventually be absorbed into a people which is unable to make any presence in our world. I would rather like to see that their plans of a new state come through, and that AmRen brought more news on this development.<br>
And why doesnt the idea and community of Orania catch more support and also inhabitants, are there problems that we dont see and hear about?</p>

		<p>They shouldn&rsquo;t have to leave the country they created.  Whites should utterly boycott SA until the situation changes.  No tourism, no diamonds no foreign aid.</p>
