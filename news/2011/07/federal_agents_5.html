<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security raided the University of Northern Virginia on Thursday morning, hauling away computers and boxes of paperwork and notifying the suburban Washington institution that it may lose its ability to accept foreign students.</p>
<p>The institution was one of the subjects of a Chronicle investigation earlier this year that examined how little-known, and often unaccredited, colleges exploit U.S. visa loopholes to admit foreign students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The university, Ms. Bassett said, can continue to hold classes but will be temporarily blocked from accepting new international students.</p>
<p>The raid on Northern Virginia, which has called itself the most popular American university for Indian students, is likely to cause an uproar in India, the second-largest sender of foreign students to the United States. A similar raid last winter on a California institution, Tri-Valley University, sparked intense media coverage in India, with newspapers and television shows there portraying oversight of the U.S. visa system as incompetent.</p>
<p>The Chronicle&rsquo;s report found that, like Tri-Valley, nearly all of Northern Virginia&rsquo;s students are in the United States on visas, and the vast majority are from India. The university enrolls a little more 2,000 students, almost all from overseas, according to Daniel Ho, the university&rsquo;s founder and majority owner.</p>
<p>Also like Tri-Valley, Northern Virginia has students who live in other states, some as far away as New York and Ohio. Federal regulations say that foreign students must be physically present on campus and can take no more than a single course per semester online. Northern Virginia officials have said that its students commute regularly to Virginia to attend classes.</p>

						<p><small><em>NDTV, July 29, 2011</em></small></p>
<p>The US has promised to protect the interests of hundreds of Indian students at the University of Northern Virginia (UNVA), which was raided yesterday by investigating and law enforcement agencies on charges of visa fraud. In a day-long exercise, dozens of officials from different federal agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), entered the Annandale campus of the university and took away with them a large number of boxes full of documents and computer hard drives from its administrative division.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Based in Annandale, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, the university is reported to have 2,400 students of which 90 per cent are from India. Of these, an overwhelming majority are said to be from Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p> {snip}</p>
<p>Based on the experience of the Tri-Valley case, and given that India had strongly objected to the manner in which its students were treated, US authorities  have informed their Indian counterparts that they would handle this case and follow-up action in a different manner.  <br>
 <br>
In New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said, &#8220;We have impressed upon the US authorities the need to ensure that the students are not victimized in any manner, since they all have valid documents.  We have been told that the focus of investigations is not on the students but on UNVA itself. The Ministry and our Mission in Washington are closely following the developments and are in the process of obtaining all details in the matter.&#8221; </p>
<p>MEA spokesperson Vishnu Prakash, added, &#8220;It is further understood that there will not be a mass termination of UNVA students SEVIS records. The US authorities are taking steps to provide necessary information to help the students  transfer to other educational institutions in the US or go back to their home countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>US immigration Officials  also made it clear that there would be no arrests, detention or electronic monitoring of students. They also said that the university would not be immediately shut down; it had been given a months&rsquo; notice to explain.</p>

		<p>Can you blame the Indians? If you had to live in India you would do anything you can to get into white civilization.</p>
<p>Ever since the English, who took India from a third world starving mess to First World White-style civilization, were forced to leave by the communist, anti-white, racist Ghandi, India has regressed to its slum level, naturally.</p>
<p>So naturally, the people of India want to go to where the white race is. I don&rsquo;t blame them, but at the same time, I don&rsquo;t want my white civilization destroyed by their presence. And Destroy us they will.</p>

		<p>The authorities move at a snail&rsquo;s pace against these phony schools in the U.S., Canada, Britain and Australia, allowing them ample time to hide the money obtained by visa fraud.</p>
<p>Compare this to how quickly they would move against anyone who doesn&rsquo;t pay their taxes on time.</p>
<p>After years of fraud, the schools eventually are shut down, but by then the owners are rich, the students have applied to immigrate, or they stay on illegally.  Nobody gets punished, except whites. </p>

		<p>Indians are targetting &#8216;higher education&rsquo; as a fradulent means of gaining entry to western nations.<br>
 Foolish western governments have pumped up the commercial higher education sector as an &#8216;easy means of earning foreign exchange&rsquo;.However, little do these stupid fools know that Indians (who are genetically a damn sight smarter and guileful than big fat, fat-headed western politicians who think they are &#8216;smart&rsquo; because they read &#8216;The Economist), have &#8216;marked their cards&rsquo; (so to speak) and use the ruse of impersonating &#8216;students&rsquo; (they have no intention of studying at all) to gain access to the west and access eventually for the entire extended family.<br>
 The &#8216;colleges&rsquo; they attend are often purely bogus front organisations founded by crooked businessmen precisely for this purpose.<br>
 It&rsquo;s no surprise that the UK, with its notoriously incompetent politicians and authorities is particularly targetted by this scam.</p>

		<p>Student visas are simply another back door mechanism by which our country is flooded with more third worlders who have no business being here.</p>
<p>Throughout my years of college and graduate school, I met many foreigners here studying on student visas.  Virtually all them were looking for a way of turning their student visa status into permanent residence.  Few had any interest in returning to their native lands with their new first rate educations to help raise up their countries out of poverty and ignorance.  Total hypocrisy.</p>

		<p>Guru, if that is &#8220;true&#8221;, then why are millions of Indians attempting to get into White Nations (what is left of them) at any cost, but I do not now one single example of any white trying to get into India?</p>
<p>During the 16th Century, the entire world was a dump. Whites wised up, dropped or ignored the religion that retarded their development and began thinking instead of worshiping fantasy. </p>
<p>India never did this, (because race determines culture). If it wasn&rsquo;t for the White Man, India would still be in the 16th century with a 16th century GDP. They can only advance so far, as history, or which I am well versed, has shown.</p>
<p>Put a white group in any environment and we can and do build civilization, all by ourselves with no help from anybody. The other Races/Breeds/Sub-Species? They  need technology or instruction from the white race. That is true world wide.</p>

		<p>Such schools are all over the place and make money off of natives just as  much. Nearly all of the schools that advertise on TV aren&rsquo;t worth that much as far as job placement goes. When asked about placement they tell you that they don&rsquo;t keep track of that. A recent publication stated that more grants are awarded to for profit 2 year associate degree schools than other schools of higher education. Kenelm you may be right about Indians in commercial schools, however, graduate students in the hard sciences almost 80% are Indians, Chinese and Koreans. I do agree with you about incompetent politicians.</p>

		<p>On a related side note, my current survival job brings me into contact with occasional cases of insurance and medicare fraud. In almost every case of provider (doctor, dentist,etc) fraud the suspect is an Indian, with Africans and other Asians trailing behind. White crooks are statistically insignificant, but I&rsquo;m sure the MSM would show mainly White fraudsters if this would be showcased on &#8220;20/20&#8221;. I see so many Singhs and Patels my head spins. <br>
Diversity is not our strength! <br>
Medicare fraud alone cost the U.S. something like $60 billion a year. </p>

<p>Maybe you ought to be more honest.  If the Brits were only after riches, they would have torn down the Taj Mahal. Instead, they fought to unify India, put down tribal warfare and organize a working state, which you inherited and ought to thank them on your knees.</p>
<p>As for Indians being so smart, it&rsquo;s a myth. What they are good at is cheating and finding ways to cheat on exams, search out old exams to study, etc.  I remember the Iranians students in the 1970s doing the same.  They even went as far as intimidating the teacher into giving them grades they hadn&rsquo;t earned.  Indians are well schooled in corruption and getting around law and systems.  The British finally got sick of it and left them to fight among themselves, which they do very well.</p>
<p>The poster going on about the health care fraud is all too correct.  Indians and others are flooding our system with no goal but to get rich through fraud and bilking.</p>
<p>No matter how the debt limit debate is resolved or not, eventually the entire economy will come crashing down and the whole world will collapse into chaos.  Don&rsquo;t go off half-cocked like Breivik did in Norway, but think defensively and wait. </p>

		<p>The people in India are willing to go to any lengths to get an education for themselves.  The poverty in India is far greater than anything ever seen in the USA.  The body trucks go around in the mornings in big cities like Calcutta to pick up the remains of those who died in the night on the streets from starvation and disease.  They are taken to the public crematories and burned.  The homeless in the U.S. are about 25 steps UP from the homeless and destitute in India.  Indians understand that education is the way up and out   &mdash;   so they will do whatever they have to do to get that education.  The people of India are actually Caucasian; it is the climate that makes them so dark.  In Kashmir, high up in the Himilayas, the people are blond, blue-eyed, and fair skinned.  The farther south you go, the darker the people become, simply so that their bodies can deal with the fierce Indian sun.  I would MUCH rather have Hindu Indians for neighbors than ghetto blacks from America&hellip;.</p>

		<p>This graph : http://goo.gl/U9hRB</p>
<p>clearly shows that the GDP of India and many other Asian countries stagnated till about 1950 and started improving only when the whites left. The British systematically looted the wealth of India and other colonies and used the money to fuel their industrialization. </p>
<p>The reason why the people want to migrate is obviously better salary and better living conditions. The same reason why white people from Russia and many other European countries also migrate to the US. </p>
<p>The only difference is that the whites are granted citizenship or  permanent residence on a platter.</p>
<p>Another reason why India is poor is the influence of policies from Russia. Again that happened partly because the US was busy giving money and weapons to the Terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, while threatening India with aircraft carriers and Nuclear weapons at the same time.<br>

		<p>I am a (white) 7th grade science teacher in a school that&rsquo;s 90 percent white and 10 percent Asian (about half whom are Indian and the other half are East Asian). </p>
<p>My Indian and East Asian students are the most disciplined and dedicated, always studying and doing extra credit to make sure they receive that &#8220;A&#8221;. There is no cheating going on as I can tell these students are naturally brilliant. I would have no problem living and teaching in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s 100 percent Indian as I know I wouldn&rsquo;t have any discipline problems and the students would all &#8216;get&rsquo; the material.</p>
<p>I have a friend who taught in a Black ghetto and lasted only a week. She couldn&rsquo;t get the kids to sit down, let alone teach anything. She had chairs thrown at her and was called names like &#8216;white bitch&rsquo; and &#8216;cracker&rsquo;. The seventh graders were all having sex and some of them were even pregnant. </p>
<p>My Indian students are so sweet and innocent that they don&rsquo;t even know the &#8216;facts of life&rsquo; in seventh grade. An Indian friend of mine told me that even the U.S. raised Indians usually stay virgins until they marry in their early twenties.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe some of the amren posters associate Indians with Africans are they are literally polar opposites of each other- skin color is NOT race. I really feel sorry for the dark skinned Indians who get mistaken for African American.</p>
<p>Please show more respect for Indians- they have the same conservative family values that whites have sadly lost over the past fifty years.</p>

		<p>It seems that the guru and AB12 both want to talk about how superior Indians are without whites around but then they want to turn around and blame whites for India&rsquo;s problems.  You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  If Indians are so much smarter than white people then why does everything good and bad that happens to you in history get determined by what whites have and haven&rsquo;t done to you, according to people like you?</p>
<p>White people are the only people in the world who don&rsquo;t do this. We put ourselves down all the time (liberalism) and take responsibility for our own actions.  It just goes to show who on the world stage right now really is the most capable (those who are able to take criticisms) and those who aren&rsquo;t capable (those who blame all their problems on white people).</p>
<p>Kenelm Digby, Indians overall aren&rsquo;t smarter than white people. Every IQ study has proven this. The ones who immigrate here are the cream of the crop and out of a billion people, the smartest minority are definately going to be pretty smart.  Of course that smartest tiny percent is going to be smarter than white politicians who get put in their positions NOT based on merit by any means.  I am sure that is what you meant, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell by your wording.</p>
<p>AB12 says this: &#8220;This graph : http://goo.gl/U9hRB<br>

<p>What a ridiculous statement. Of course when you are ruled by a superior power you don&rsquo;t have much room to move up in the world.  Of course.  That is how it has always been. It doesn&rsquo;t mean the ruling power is destroying your country or is somehow inferior to you. A lot of times it means the contrary.  Why was Rome more powerful than Egypt or Iraq when it was ruling over them?  And of course, ever since Europeans left the Far East, the Far East has been &#8220;doing better&#8221; simply because it has been learning from the West.  Instead of trying to out do us in Space Exploration while talking about how evil white colonialism was, I am waiting for either China or India to invent their own stuff entirely and start from where they were in the 1600s or whenever, when their greatness was mostly based on what they had in their soil as opposed to any sort of intellect. It is a wonder that Europe managed to create most of the world&rsquo;s science without  being blessed with the natural resources that the rest of the world had.</p>
<p>Melissa, nobody on here has said that Indians are just like blacks.  What we are saying is that overall they are less intelligent than whites and they are less capable of creating advanced societies.  Instead of spending time around the smartest 1% who immigrate here, maybe it would do you a lot of good to go spend a day in India among the average Third World Indian, and then you can come back here and talk about how you would &#8220;love to live entirely surrounded by them&#8221;.<br>

		<p># 13 Hindu Catholic wrote &rsquo; I would MUCH rather have Hindu Indians as neighbors than ghetto blacks from America.</p>
<p>It would be a shock if  &#8216;ghetto&rsquo; black was not included in the discussion .  It seems that some believe that they can always portray a better image of themselves by comparing themselves with the so called ghetto blacks.</p>
<p>#16 Melissa wrote &rsquo; I have friend who taught in a Black ghetto and only lasted a week&rsquo;<br>
&#8220;My indian students are so sweet and discipline..<br>
This is similar to poster #13. You are exploiting the impression many have of Blacks in the &#8216;ghetto&rsquo; inorder to paint a more positive picture of another group.<br>
I am sure many immigrant African in the USA are viewed by teachers as hard working and discipline .</p>
<p>to #7 Observer . India GDP in 1600 AD was higher than every country but China . It was even higher than  Western Europe (List of regions by past GDP(PPP) WIKIPEDIA) <br>
            <br>
India.         74.25 billion<br>
Western Europe 65.6  billion<br>
Eastern Europe  9.2</p>
<p>So it was about the same size as both Eastern and Western Europe combined.</p>
<p>No one should use this scandal to argue that Indian students cheat on tests because it is not true . You  will always find students from all ethnic background who  cheat on examination. <br>
The overwhelmly number of indians obtained their grades honestly<br>
with hard work.<br>
I would not go as far and conclude that Indians are &#8216;smart&rsquo;, but Indian immigrants in the USA do well academically. For example, Vinodhini Vasudevan a 12 year old indian girl  obtained a perfect SAT score of 1600(writing was not part of the test) .<br>
At that time, she was said to be youngest to have done so .<br>
 There are also many winners of the Spelling Bee who are Indian Americans.  For the last 13 years, nine of the winners of the Spelling Bee were Indians.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think I once said that Indians were overall smarter than whites. What I have said is that there is and has been selection of groups of people. 1. The more daring  and thus probably the most inteligent whites came to America, 2. The lowest rung of Africans were brought here thus not very inteligent and 3. most of the Indians that were allowed here since the 1960&rsquo;s are high acheivers thus more inteligent. So them are the facts folks here in the USA and we couldn&rsquo;t possibly generalise from that. Anyone saying the Europeons had altruistic motives for invading Asia or Africa and for that matter the Americas are grossly mistaken. Mayan gold, Asian silk and spices, and diamonds from Africa were the great motivators, spread of Christianity was the great excuse. A very common notion persists that Jews inherantly are the most intelligent people, true about the current population of jews, however, it happened over a long period of time when they were slaughtered by Europeons and Asians with only the brightest few surviving. Selection for whatever reason happens and leaves its mark. </p>

		<p>Caste system remember; and if you do not think caste and color go hand in hand you haven&rsquo;t seen how the light skinned, Euro-Indians lord it over the darker toned masses beneath them. Remember as well that Alexander the Great conquered India -and as per policy, left his Greek officers to rule the locals.</p>
<p>India sits atop some of the greatest mineral wealth in the world; so a massive GDP based on slave-dug mines and placer deposits is a shaky foundation to boast of greatness. How many universities and hospitals were in India in 1757 when the East India Company (a Private corporation) won the Battle of Plassey and conquered India? How many miles of railroad? How many acts of Suttee before the British stamped on the face of &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; and put an end to the barbarous practice of burning living women to satisfy their dead husband?</p>
<p>You boast of how well India has done since the British withdrew? Then why are so many Indians immigrating out? Why are so many demanding from Her Majesty&rsquo;s government free health care in England -when they were so happy to throw off that same government, under the illusion that they were &#8220;all growed up an&rsquo; could take care of themselves&#8221;? <br>
I can go on if you like.<br>
On the face of it; it is not We who need to get our facts straight here.</p>

		<p>The question isnt how smart Indians are..or how smart Chinese<br>
are..the question is, where do their loyalties lie. And the<br>
answer is..with other Indians, and other Chinese. And since<br>
the issue here is power, political power, whites who give away control of their destiny to a group whose loyalty and love isnt for whites..will suffer a fate they can barely imagine.<br>
Do not give your politcal power away..ever for any group no matter how nice they might seem. dont give away power no matter how nice sounding the argument is,  because when the mask comes off and the nice people you trusted turn out to be not so nice..you will really learn to know what misery is. </p>

		<p>To Courtney from Alabama,</p>
<p>You are putting words in my mouth. I&rsquo;m not trying to prove the superiority of Indians, or inferiority of any other race. I believe cultural and policy influences are the main contributors towards how a group or country behaves and performs. While not denying racial or genetic influences, I would say that plays a much lesser role.</p>
<p>The British were definitely not on an altruistic mission around the world. East India Company was a profit making corporation and corporations were allowed to have private armies in those days. They misused those powers to conquer other countries and improve their profit. If you let corporations possess armies and wage war, the same history would repeat again. </p>
<p>Quote - &#8221; they want to turn around and blame whites for India&rsquo;s problems&#8221;<br>
I&rsquo;m not blaming the whites, I&rsquo;m blaming the govt of United States.</p>
<p>Quote - &#8220;The ones who immigrate here are the cream of the crop&#8221;.</p>
<p>That is certainly not true. The ones who immigrate are pretty much an average representation of the people in India. Its mostly rich people who can afford an education in the US who immigrate. </p>
<p>The other set is the H1B visa holders, and this category is often misused by certain companies who don&rsquo;t pay well and are thus not able to afford hiring the best people. Only people brought in by top technology companies are the bright ones.</p>
<p>Quote - &#8220;It doesn&rsquo;t mean the ruling power is destroying your country or is somehow inferior to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, I never talked about superiority or inferiority. If the rulers are just interested in milking money, they would do just that. They have no interest in improving people&rsquo;s incomes or healthcare.</p>
<p>Quote - &#8220;I am waiting for either China or India to invent their <br>
own stuff entirely and start&#8221;</p>
<p>Just wait 40 more years. Inventing stuff requires a lot of money, and India and China didn&rsquo;t have the colonial loot to fuel it.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s get some facts straight here. There have always been empires. Some are better than others. The West has always had the best empires. Along with the &#8220;looting!!!&#8221; the British Empire gave back a hundred-fold. India would never be the largest democracy in the world without the British Raj. The British lifted 3 million Indians out of poverty, build that incredible railroad that&rsquo;s still in use today, gave India British law  &mdash;  the finest in the world, and a great educational system. It is what a empire leaves behind that matters. These are merely a few contributions. The British were ahead of the curve in almost all things: Technology, invention, culture, politics, law, science, and on and on. The world we live in today, the things we take for granted, were given to us by the British. If their empire were  removed from the world scene most of life would go &#8220;poof.&#8221; This is simple fact  &mdash;  look at the Industrial Revolution alone  &mdash;  and cannot be disputed. And, yes, I know my history. I am a college teacher. </p>

The university, Ms. Bassett said, can continue to hold classes but will be temporarily blocked from accepting new international students.<br>
The raid on Northern Virginia, which has called itself the most popular American university for Indian students, is likely to cause an uproar in India, the second-largest sender of foreign students to the United States. A similar raid last winter on a California institution, Tri-Valley University, sparked intense media coverage in India, with newspapers and television shows there portraying oversight of the U.S. visa system as incompetent.[/quote]</p>

<p>Indians are very bigoted people, they have their famous Caste system and your apologies only go so far.</p>
<p>I think Indians, while often polite and clever are none-the-less cheaters, here in the modern age.</p>
<p>As for attitude, mine has hardened since I have read a number of posts by Indians online who express intense hatred of the West and whites, and proclaim the mission to take it over and wipe out whites demographically.  So after those online experiences combined with some of my personal observances over the years - combined with what I have seen going on in health care realms, I am against giving one Indian sanctuary in any Western country.  They need to figure out how to mange their sick and diseased, overpopulated  nation rather than invade Western nations that avoided such a problem through INTELLIGENT management of themselves. </p>
<p>And that is at the heart of the entire problem. White nations were for decades concerned with the future world scenario of over-population, so movements like Zero Growth and such existed as educational organization aimed at guaranteeing a livable future.  The problem is that it never caught on in any non-White nation other than Japan.  Now as the proportions of white to other populations decline, the West is being overwhelmed by non-whites.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they were nice as individuals here or there or in general, displacement is displacement.  </p>
<p>What will prevent the very same conditions to result when third world nations overwhelm us?  It&rsquo;s already begun.  Many parts of California are unlivable and dangerous to whites.  I am a refugee from that state, having left in 2002.  Now, California Gov. Brown is giving free college tuition to illegal immigrants.  So the few white taxpayers left are footing the bill for their final dispossession and preventing their own children from attending college.  This is how upside down our nation and the West has become.  They are gambling that nothing will change for the bureaucratic state and industry will recover when enough working poor are created and accepting of their status.  This all requires the destruction of American and whites, completely.  You can&rsquo;t expect all of us to just accept that as sheep would.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&#8221;clearly shows that the GDP of India and many other Asian countries stagnated till about 1950 and started improving only when the whites left. The British systematically looted the wealth of India and other colonies and used the money to fuel their industrialization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Another poster has mentioned India&rsquo;s mineral wealth.  I see no GDP coming out of India other than human surplus populations.  They take U.S. offshore jobs, apply in droves for H1-B visas for jobs with reduced salaries in the U.S., displacing many well qualified white citizens.  I knew of many who lost jobs to them, not because they were better, but cheaper and companies used the Diversity fad to justify it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why the people want to migrate is obviously better salary and better living conditions. The same reason why white people from Russia and many other European countries also migrate to the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Today, very few or NO immigrants come to the U.S. because they desire to become Americans, but because they are looking for economic advantages and see all the loopholes in our systems that used to rely on honesty and ethics of a dominantly white population.  That is all gone now.  Look at the majority of CEOs and even Wall Street manipulators, they are largely not white and the ethics of Euro-whites in business is long gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only difference is that the whites are granted citizenship or permanent residence on a platter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Shows your complete dedication to CHEATING in graph and historical interpretation. Everyone knows that white immigration has been severely restricted in the US since The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965.  Most if not all Russian, Ukrainian, and other Slavic nation immigration has been achieved through church sponsored asylum programs.  They also tend to do well in school, but an element of crime has accompanied their arrival.  However, that criminal addition has not been violent, drug related.  It is mostly restricted to auto theft and chop shops, and seems to be falling off lately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another reason why India is poor is the influence of policies from Russia. Again that happened partly because the US was busy giving money and weapons to the Terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, while threatening India with aircraft carriers and Nuclear weapons at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; India was very arrogantly a member of Tito&rsquo;s Nonaligned Nations Movement that thumbed its nose at the U.S. and like Yugoslavia, took what amounted to &#8220;bribes&#8221; from both The U.S. and The U.S.S.R. to not favor the other or give some temporal advantage.  When the Soviets were in Afghanistan and India and Pakistan acquired Nuclear weapons at the same time, you better believe that the U.S., NATO and the West in general was concerned.  That is the reason there were U.S. Naval vessels around the region!</p>
<p>This post by AB12 is a good example of just how Indians are disposed to interpret dishonestly and claim some supposed rights.  In other words, this is how cheating the facts is done.</p>

		<p>Europeans and The British Empire invented and spread the modern world to most parts of it.  It civilized barbaric &#8220;nations&#8221; like India, which was really a patchwork of kingdoms run by warlords.  </p>
<p>Today, we hear daily about the robbery of the colonists.  In most cases, treaties were made for trade and invitations to enter made.  No colonizing nation ever stormed a beach or militarily conquered any region, but made treaties with various rulers to help manage and advance said regions.  Even Cortez in Mexico was invited and supported by indigenous tribes in overthrowing the Aztecs.  That sometimes corruption occurred is true, human beings are human beings, but credit should also be given where it is due.  No other race or ethnic group would have done it better or with more high-minded intention, in spite of low points like the Opium Wars.</p>
<p>The idea that the West ought to have benefited the world for no charge or should have not expected to benefit economically from their gargantuan epoch of spreading civilization is as disingenuous as the present day attitude that the West and whites in particular owe everyone else endless and free EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>That whites allow them to enter in such numbers and displace them permanently guarantees the eventual collapse of the West and its decline to the state of India, the continent of Africa or any other poverty racked nation in the world.  </p>

<p>Wait and see; as their numbers grow, demands and arrogance will increase.  I already find that online elsewhere.  Mexicans in California used to be mostly polite and their crime low impact until they reached a critical mass of (yep) over 10% of the population.

		<p>OBSERVER - you are an example of a number of folk on this board who are determined to hate anyone who doesn&rsquo;t look &#8220;white.&#8221;  That is an unthinking and unfortunate attitude.  My position is, I don&rsquo;t like ghetto blacks - but I don&rsquo;t like poor white trash, either; both have the entitlement and victicrat mentalities that I so despise.  As for the folk native to India, they ARE Caucasian.  I made the point earlier of Nature allowing people to survive in the hottest parts of the country by providing them with darker skin than those in the Kashmir area, in the altitude.  And, I don&rsquo;t like the barrio Mexicans either - the ones who are determined that illegals should stay here.  No.  We simply can&rsquo;t afford them.  If you&rsquo;ve been to the San Fernando Valley from North Hollywood east, you know it&rsquo;s Little Tijuana because it&rsquo;s all Mexicans who live there.  When the Jews lived in N. H&rsquo;wd, it was a showplace.  Now it&rsquo;s a filthy trash heap.  So I don&rsquo;t like ghetto blacks, white trash, or barrio Mexicans any more than you do, Observer.  But I am NOT willing to tar all people with the same brush.  Folks who make the effort to get an education and CONTRIBUTE something positive to society are fine with me, regardless of ethnicity.  I think blind hatred is just as stupid as blind liberalism.</p>
