<h1><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1127012/Police-arrest-goat-accused-armed-robbery.html">Police Arrest Goat Accused of Armed Robbery</a></h1>
 

<p>Daily Mail (London), July 19, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Police in Nigeria are holding a goat on suspicion of attempted armed robbery.</p>
<p>Vigilantes seized the black and white goat, saying it was an armed robber who had used black magic to transform himself into an animal to escape after trying to steal a Mazda 323.</p>
<p>&#8216;The group of vigilante men came to report that while they were on patrol they saw some hoodlums attempting to rob a car. They pursued them.</p>
<p>&#8216;However one of them escaped while the other turned into a goat,&rsquo; Kwara state police spokesman Tunde Mohammed said.</p>
<p>&#8216;We cannot confirm the story, but the goat is in our custody.</p>
<p>&#8216;We cannot base our information on something mystical. It is something that has to be proved scientifically, that a human being turned into a goat,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Belief in witchcraft is widespread in parts of Nigeria, Africa&rsquo;s most populous nation.</p>
<p>Residents came to the police station to see the goat, photographed in one national newspaper on its knees next to a pile of straw.</p>
