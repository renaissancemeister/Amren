							I Was Beaten, Taunted for Being White, Bronx Man Says After Subway Attack

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
						<p>
							A Bronx man was viciously assaulted and robbed on a subway train Sunday by four men who he says taunted him for being white.
						</p>
						<p>
							Police confirmed they are investigating the assault and robbery of Jason Fordell, 29, but have not labeled it a hate crime.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip} A fifth passenger who police say spontaneously joined in the attack has been arrested.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;Everyone on the train was egging them on,&#8221; said Fordell, 29, of the early-morning attack on the 4 train.
						</p>
						<p>
							He said he was returning home at 5 a.m. from an East Village nightclub where he sells his hand-designed leather accessories when his Gothic getup drew unwelcome attention.
						</p>
						<p>
							<br />
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;People started saying stupid little comments &mdash; cracker this, white boy this, f &mdash; &mdash; t this,&#8221; Fordell said. &#8220;I told them the only reason they were saying this is there was four of them and one of me.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;I was in a headlock, punched and kicked on the floor,&#8221; Fordell said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then a passenger decided to join in &mdash; declaring, &#8220;Oh, I get a few shots, too,&#8221; before kicking and punching Fordell in the head, according to cops.
						</p>
						<p>
							When Fordell finally left the train at his Fordham Road stop, his original attackers snatched his bag and ran. Inside was $2,900 worth of merchandise, cops said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fordell chased the men to the token booth downstairs, where two of them pummeled him while the others escaped with the bag.
						</p>
						<p>
							{snip}
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;I had a whole lot of bleeding from my skull,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My eye is swollen five different colors. There was blood in my urine. I have a footprint on my back and on the back of my neck.&#8221;
						</p>
						<p>
							The case is being investigated by detectives, but has not been assigned to the NYPD hate crimes task force because cops are unsure if the suspects were motivated by bias, sources said.
						</p>
						<p>
							&#8220;They have to look at whether that was the motivation before the robbery,&#8221; a police source said.

								What a joke our urban police are! What would they have to have in order to say, &#8220;We&rsquo;re looking at a black-on-White hate crime here.&#8221; Their tongues seem to cleave to the roofs of their mouths any time they try to utter those words.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also, typical black tactics: Four burly (there, I said a &#8220;frowned-upon&#8221; word) blacks attacking one much-smaller White man. Or rather, five; I forgot the thug-by-opportunity who joined in the fun after it started. Does New York City issue concealed-carry permits? If they don&rsquo;t, they certainly should.

								I was punched in the face by a black in the NY subway system at a Fifth avenue stop. The attack was unprovoked and include a racial epithet. The attacker ran away and was not found. Facial and eye injuries were sustained that required multiple visits to two medical specialists care to resolve. The investigating officers refused to classify the attack as a bias or hate crime. One of the investigating officers, a black, told me the epithet used in the attack was not one commonly used by blacks, impugning my account despite obvious head injuries and witnesses.

								Obviously, race war has moved from a dirty war of &#8220;crime&#8221; to group attacks and simmering open war.
							</p>
							<p>
								Notice that the media has gone from covering this up to selective coverage in places like NYC to make it seem as if blacks do this without consequence. A subtle form of intimidation and emasculation of whites.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now here is an interesting question. How many blacks have been gunned down this summer, in self defense, as black violence escalates.
							</p>
							<p>
								A number of people have commented that its only a matter of time before one or more whites gun down and entire &#8220;flash mob&#8221; in self-defense.
							</p>
							<p>
								What makes people think this has not already happened, perhaps several times? Media coverage is practically manufactured, it&rsquo;s manipulated so heavily. And obviously the last thing they want getting out is successful defense against mob violence by killing the mob. More guns were bought since Obama was elected then needed to equip the top ten militaries of the world combined. They would have us believe those guns are not being used.
							</p>
							<p>
								I find that unlikely. What I find much more likely is the US is one flashpoint away from an open racial civil war.

								A group of blacks attack a white male and shout racial slurs?

							<p>
								And law enforcement AND the media cannot connect the dots?

								&#8220;WHAT IF&#8221; everything about this case was exactly the same, except the races were reversed?

								It would be a national media scandal and the media would have a field day with it.

								When will carnival barkers like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton even utter a peep about the staggering level of black on white violence?

								There was a time when you could avoid black criminals by avoiding black neighborhoods, black urban areas, etc.
							</p>
							<p>
								But our government is making it impossible to avoid. Our government knows that if whites were allowed to segregate they would vote their own interests and the country would move towards splitting in two.
							</p>
							<p>
								About 4 years ago I moved to a modest/lower income area that was almost all white. Today it is becoming more and more mixed. I recognize I will need to move again or risk being trapped in a deteriorating neighborhood.

								I doubt Fordell, or any other White man, for that matter have any good cause to expect much help from the politicized cops or the Government&rsquo;s &#8220;Justice&#8221; system. We need only recall what happened to Berhard Goetz several years ago when he successfully defended his person and his property from a gang of taxpayer supported &#8220;youth&#8221;.
							</p>
							<p>
								Goetz became a fugitive from &#8220;justice&#8221;, surrendering himself to the cops several days afterward. He was then charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, and several firearms offenses, even though HE was the VICTIM. Fortunately, the jury of his peers were apparently as fed up as he. The jury convicted him only of possessing an &#8220;illegal&#8221; firearm, for which he was sentenced to a year in prison.
							</p>
							<p>
								Perhaps Fordell is lucky he didn&rsquo;t fight back while White.

								I sincerely believe that police do not think it is racist because they EXPECT this type of behavior from blacks. Whites are held to a much higher standard. Whites are not expected to attack blacks for robbery because&hellip;. in general, they don&rsquo;t have much and therefore the attack must be motivated by race.
							</p>
							<p>
								When blacks attack whites, it is generally for money or rape. If the black should happen to call the white person a cracker as they beat them senseless, that is just uttered in the heat of the moment and not really &#8220;racism in the true sense&#8221; This is therefore a simple robbery or rape and not a hate crime. Really, I heard a lawyer from the $outhern Poverty Law Center say that. <br />

								Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;&hellip;.dressed in Goth. Works in leather. East Village. I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s homosexual. And takes the Subway at 5 AM? That&rsquo;s like smearing yourself in blood and going skinny dipping beyond the surf on the Australian reefs. Or like strapping a dead antelope to your butt and running through a pride of hungry lions. Jeez. Ya know? It&rsquo;s becoming more and more dangerous out there due to packs of black thugs believing, rightly, they are entitled to any behavior by Eric &#8220;My People&#8221; Holden with no consequences. And you want to roam their territory at 5 AM alone? One thing about the Goth culture&hellip;.it&rsquo;s all about fascination with death. And this guy is going to be just that, DEAD, unless he gets a clue.

								Of course the cops are not going to call it motivated by race&hellip;.it is only motivated by race if a White attacks a black. Right? Which RARELY ever happens in the first place! This is nothing more than even more of the anti-White agenda, this time by cops. Beware my White friends, the cops are NOT your friend. They have all been indoctrinated into the enemies camp.

								First mistake: when there are four of them and one of you, don&rsquo;t taunt then (unless you have a concealed carry permit).
							</p>
							<p>
								That said, the treatment of this man by the cops is appalling, and this incident shows why the whole &#8220;hate crime&#8221; designation is a sham and a fraud.

								A random black passenger just spontaneously joins in on the attack on a white person. Don&rsquo;t you just love that one. He couldn&rsquo;t let an opportunity to harm a white person go by. Things have taken an ugly turn in the US in recent years; no telling where this is all going.

								<i>&#8216;Everyone on the train was egging them on,&rsquo; said Fordell, of the early-morning attack.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								Vicious black attacks of Whites such as this and the &#8220;knockout game&#8221; are becoming more open and brazen precisely because of media cover-up and the government&rsquo;s ho-hum reaction:
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Police&hellip; have not labeled it a hate crime&hellip;not been assigned to the NYPD hate crimes task force&hellip; cops are unsure if the suspects were motivated by bias&hellip;They have to look at whether that was the motivation before the robbery, a police source said.</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								Even though Fordell reported: <i>People started saying stupid &mdash; cracker this, white boy this, f&mdash;t this</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								Expect these black-on-White mob attacks to escalate in intensity, number and violence as the government loses its ability to shower money on unproductive people, permanent high unemployment settles in and the economy continues to worsen. Last Memorial Day weekend, blacks violently rioted throughout the East Coast from Long Beach, NY to Nashville, TN with nary a passing mention in the press or edicts from the government that violent, racist black mob attacks will be stopped with deadly force.
							</p>
							<p>
								It looks like neither the government nor the police give a **** about your worthless Kulak life so it is up to YOU to protect yourself and your loved ones.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you MUST visit the Mag Mile or center of a large city, do not dress expensively and be prepared to defend yourself.

								Erick Holder will never investigate black on white hate crimes because as he said they are his people and to do so would demean him. so white folk are not his people by his admission. He is only working for non whites in other words. Dont think to do so would mean you need to do some thing while you can.

								<b>I have been giving a lot of thought </b>to why the police are so reluctant to call these events &#8220;hate crimes,&#8221; even though they are done by blacks who completely despise whites. <b>Without knowing for sure, I presume that local police departments are short of funds, so much so that they must beg the Federal Government for money, and the Feds only give the money on the condition that the Police not label anything a hate crime unless the suspect is white.</b>

								The NYPD brass, being the typical White-hating, bureaucrats that they are, are insisting this isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;bias&#8221; attack. Their rationale? Because the guy who got beaten called the Hispanic attacker a &#8220;S**c&#8221; AFTER the Hispanic attacked him and his being assaulted by him and the gang of blacks.
							</p>
							<p>
								So&hellip;we are now supposed to believe that NONE of the various victims of &#8220;bias&#8221; crimes allegedly committed by Whites, ever called their attackers, &#8220;White boy, Cracker, Honkey,&#8221; etc, etc?
							</p>
							<p>
								Then they trot out the old stand-by&hellip;&#8221;we don&rsquo;t know if the attack was motivated solely by race.&#8221; Seems whenever Whites are attacked, called racial slurs, or even bear witness to Blacks or Browns threatening them racially, the ever noble police just can&rsquo;t make that &#8220;bias&#8221; connection. Somehow, though, if a White person looks sideways at a non-White, it is merely presumed out of the gate that &#8220;hate&#8221; is the only possible motive.

								I frequently hear blacks say, &#8220;Well, I just know I was the victim of white racism because that white person gave me a dirty look/that white waitress gave me a bad table/that white employer didn&rsquo;t hire me/that white woman wouldn&rsquo;t go out with me,&#8221; etc., etc. And we&rsquo;re supposed to feel sorry for them and think of them as poor, oppressed victims of evil, vicious, racist whites. But when whites are victims of black racism, what do THEY say? &ldquo;My eye is swollen five different colors. There was blood in my urine. I have a footprint on my back and on the back of my neck.&rdquo; Or far worse. And&hellip;most people shrug.

								Not to quibble with you, John, but those who think Whites are violent racist HAVE been reading &#8220;enough&#8221; newspapers &mdash; too many newspapers!

								Simply put, blacks are pathetic. They have a reason or excuse for everything. They have all been a victim of racism, and they deserve the world handed to them on a platter. For that, I blame squarely on the idealistic multiculturalist morons. <br />
								Back to the matter at hand. If you live in an area that is greater than 10% black, expect crap like this to happen. For the sake of your children, leave areas that have substantial black populations. It&rsquo;s time we segregate ourselves even more. True story, I work with a lady who wanted to move to a more liberal, diverse area. So, she packed her bags and moved the family to a suburb in Atlanta. Guess who was back to rural Kentucky in a year? Guess she realized that living in a homogenous area trumps getting beaten down, harassed, or putting your kids through the rotten Atlanta public school system.

								With all due respect, I COMPLETELY disagree. I&rsquo;ve lived in the city (meaning the five boroughs) all my life. Subways (just like everyday life) USED to be ok (meaning in the 50s, up until the mid 60s).
							</p>
							<p>
								The very LAST thing you want to be on is a subway anytime after the end of rush hour until dawn the next morning. The later the hour, the better the chance you have of getting attacked or harassed. There are exceptions - such as when massive crowds take the D Train after a Yankee night game or the 7 Train after a Mets night game or an event at MSG.
							</p>
							<p>
								They did a study some years ago and found the 7 Train to be safest (because it goes through the fewest amount of bad neighborhoods (duh)).
							</p>
							<p>
								So many other lines competed for the worst. Just don&rsquo;t take any subway (like the 1,2,3,4,5,6, A, D, etc., etc., etc.), which go through BOTH Brooklyn and Harlem and The Bronx. As a matter of fact, don&rsquo;t take any subway at all if you can afford not to.
							</p>
							<p>
								But if you HAVE to, stay in the front of the first car where the motorman is or in the middle (5th car of a 10 car train), where the conductor is. Most of the motormen and conductors are black (and their sympathies will mostly lie with the perps), but they&rsquo;ll be forced to at least call in to HQ, because they don&rsquo;t want a police investigation, which later showed they were witness to a crime and did nothing about it. Those are very good paying jobs for black people and their union is very strong and they do NOT want to lose their jobs. In this one case, green trumps black to them.

								Brooklyn man accused of joining in subway assault freed without bail <br />

								A Brooklyn man accused of joining in a subway assault was freed without bail Monday night after his lawyer claimed it was a case of mistaken identity.
							</p>
							<p>
								Barminthe Ramoutar, 54, was booked Sunday after police charged that he yelled, &#8220;I get a few shots, too!&#8221; and joined in an assault on Jason Fordell, 29, in the Bronx.
							</p>
							<p>
								Fordell fingered Ramoutar, a balding fruit salesman, police said. But Ramoutar&rsquo;s lawyer said at his arraignment that his client has arthritis and cannot make a fist.
							</p>
							<p>
								&#8220;It&rsquo;s simply physically impossible,&#8221; said the lawyer, Trudy Strassburger.

								I think they have a chip on their shoulder because 95% of White people don&rsquo;t want anything to do with them. Do you see White parents breaking the law to send their children to inner-city Black schools? Do you see White families moving into Black neighborhoods to get away from White neighborhoods? Nope, but you sure see it the other way around. We&rsquo;re perfectly happy without them, yet they need us.

								The more the media and police cover up the nature of the black mob attacks on white people the less credibility they have among the average white population (and even a few liberals) who are starting to realize the major con job going down (closing beaches down because of hot weather???). Chicago is ground zero for this double-speak, and the purveyors re doubling down as proxy PR reps for the black population, and by doing so in such a brazen manner, a massive awakening among sleeping whites is taking hold. The hate crimes statutes are only biting them in their rear-ends by showing that their are two standards of punishable behavior, one for whites and another for blacks.

								I think a problem most people have when the read such a story is to assume that the police or other groups are either remiss or in cahoots with the blacks by not labeling this a hate crime. In fact, it is the law, not the policeman at fault. The way the blatantly discriminatory law was set up was designed to protect minorities and only minorities. By definition, a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; under the law is a crime by a white man against a minority. If Clinton and his cronies, in setting up the law, had any interest in fairness and justice they would have worded it so that anyone who committed a crime against anyone else from a desire to attack another race would be guilty, such as in the crime posted above. As it stands now, white men are 2nd class citizens in regards to the law. Shows you just how much a truckling, do anything for money type Clinton must have been to make such a law against himself and his own family.

The #1 pound for pound best fighter in the world is UFC champion - Anderson Silva ( an African Brazilian). AND, the current Heavy Weight World Champion MMA - UFC is a brown skinned (&#8220;Brown Pride&#8221;) Hispanic - Cain Velasquez who defeated the big muscular blonde Nordic giant Brock Lesnar 9-0 KO.

Lets face it,whites make pathetic fighters as compared to blacks, hispanics and in some cases even east Asians. Even the World boxing campions from Russia are of mongol origin especially considering that they have moslem surnames.

								MMA is rigged just like all the other major sports by organized crime. They promote black (or non-white) supremacy just like all the other criminals who run our nation.
							</p>
							<p>
								And the reason for that is that the average white Christian man is the only group that has won any freedoms for anybody anywhere. The elites don&rsquo;t like that. So they take every opportunity to drag the white man down, particularly in the media.
							</p>
							<p>
								Anderson Silva, Brock Lesnar, Cain Velasquez, Chuck Liddell etc are all steroided-up phonies laughing their heads off at the gullible dopes who made them rich. They couldn&rsquo;t care less what the phony result is in the ring. They made it big-they&rsquo;re rich, they don&rsquo;t work but a few hours a day, with long layoffs to vacation and have fun, and they have their pick of thousands of good-looking women. And if throwing matches, telling lies, and a bit of acting are what it takes to get where they are, so be it. Meanwhile you schmuck back and forth to your tedious, boring job 40+ hours a week, heavy with debt, and no break on the horizon. Ha Ha!
							</p>
							<p>
								All the stuff on TV is phony. If you think that TV is a true depiction of reality, you should be certified as mentally ill. TV is far too valuable and powerful to use to tell the public the truth. Much better to use it to mislead and distract the gullible sheep. Fleeced, fooled, and ruled. And you pay willingly for the destruction. What a con!<br />

								Uhh, you posted some huge mistruths here. The Gracies are of Scottish descent, maybe mixed with some Portuguese Brazilian. MMA has proven the efficacy of European martial arts especially wrestling-both freestyle and Greco-Roman and Boxing (especially in its Asian Muay Thai variation wherein you can use more than fists). I think Georges St Pierre would be considered top pound for pound fighter not Silva who was very lucky in getting by white guy Chael Sonnen. I doubt Brown Pride will last long as Heavyweight Champ, Lesnar is a skilled wrestler, very strong but not well rounded and a little past his prime. The most impressive MMA fighter of recent vintage was Fedor Emelienko, a White Russian. The Russian domination of Boxing is by White Europeans not Mongols. Nice try MMA Fan.

								Unless you&rsquo;re rich like Donald Trump it&rsquo;s almost impossible to get a concealed carry permit in the People&rsquo;s Republic of New York City. Remember, this is a city where a man like Michael Bloomberg is considered to be a Republican (anyplace else he&rsquo;d be a liberal Democrat).

								&ldquo;American Murder Mystery
							</p>
							<p>
								Why is crime rising in so many American cities? The answer implicates one of the most celebrated antipoverty programs of recent decades.&rdquo;

							<p>
								By Hanna Rosin
							</p>
							<p>
								Key excerpts to this explosive piece:
							</p>
							<p>
								&ldquo;About five years ago, Janikowski embarked on a more ambitious project. He&rsquo;d built up enough trust with the police to get them to send him daily crime and arrest reports, including addresses and types of crime. He began mapping all violent and property crimes, block by block, across the city. &ldquo;These cops on the streets were saying that crime patterns are changing,&rdquo; he said, so he wanted to look into it.
							</p>
							<p>
								When his map was complete, a clear if strangely shaped pattern emerged: Wait a minute, he recalled thinking. I see this bunny rabbit coming up. People are going to accuse me of being on shrooms! The inner city, where crime used to be concentrated, was now clean. But everywhere else looked much worse: arrests had skyrocketed along two corridors north and west of the central city (the bunny rabbit&rsquo;s ears) and along one in the southeast (the tail). Hot spots had proliferated since the mid-1990s, and little islands of crime had sprung up where none had existed before, dotting the map all around the city.

								Janikowski might not have managed to pinpoint the cause of this pattern if he hadn&rsquo;t been married to Phyllis Betts, a housing expert at the University of Memphis. Betts and Janikowski have two dogs, three cats, and no kids; they both tend to bring their work home with them. Betts had been evaluating the impact of one of the city government&rsquo;s most ambitious initiatives: the demolition of the city&rsquo;s public-housing projects, as part of a nationwide experiment to free the poor from the destructive effects of concentrated poverty. Memphis demolished its first project in 1997. The city gave former residents federal &ldquo;Section 8&rdquo; rent-subsidy vouchers and encouraged them to move out to new neighborhoods. Two more waves of demolition followed over the next nine years, dispersing tens of thousands of poor people into the wider metro community.
							</p>
							<p>
								If police departments are usually stingy with their information, housing departments are even more so. Getting addresses of Section 8 holders is difficult, because the departments want to protect the residents&rsquo; privacy. Betts, however, helps the city track where the former residents of public housing have moved. Over time, she and Janikowski realized that they were doing their fieldwork in the same neighborhoods.
							</p>
							<p>
								About six months ago, they decided to put a hunch to the test. Janikowski merged his computer map of crime patterns with Betts&rsquo;s map of Section 8 rentals. Where Janikowski saw a bunny rabbit, Betts saw a sideways horseshoe (&ldquo;He has a better imagination,&rdquo; she said). Otherwise, the match was near-perfect. On the merged map, dense violent-crime areas are shaded dark blue, and Section 8 addresses are represented by little red dots. All of the dark-blue areas are covered in little red dots, like bursts of gunfire. The rest of the city has almost no dots.

								Betts remembers her discomfort as she looked at the map. The couple had been musing about the connection for months, but they were amazed &mdash; and deflated &mdash; to see how perfectly the two data sets fit together. She knew right away that this would be a &ldquo;hard thing to say or write.&rdquo; Nobody in the antipoverty community and nobody in city leadership was going to welcome the news that the noble experiment that they&rsquo;d been engaged in for the past decade had been bringing the city down, in ways they&rsquo;d never expected. But the connection was too obvious to ignore, and Betts and Janikowski figured that the same thing must be happening all around the country. Eventually, they thought, they&rsquo;d find other researchers who connected the dots the way they had, and then maybe they could get city leaders, and even national leaders, to listen.&rdquo;

								And later: The smoking gun of who visited this disaster upon Americans&rsquo; (note the name please – another subversive in our midst)
							</p>
							<p>
								&ldquo;Polikoff is a hero to Betts and many of her colleagues. In August 1966, he filed two related class-action suits against the Chicago Housing Authority and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, on behalf of a woman named Dorothy Gautreaux and other tenants. Gautreaux wanted to leave the ghetto, but the CHA offered housing only in neighborhoods just like hers. Polikoff became notorious in the Chicago suburbs; one community group, he wrote, awarded him a gold-plated pooper-scooper &ldquo;to clean up all the s***&rdquo; he wanted to bring into the neighborhood. A decade later, he argued the case before the Supreme Court and won. Legal scholars today often compare the case&rsquo;s significance to that of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.

								1. The Gracies are clearly non white. They are no more Scottish as Obama is English. Just because you are partially white don&rsquo;t make you one. Next we will have to call the dark skinned Gracies as Scots &amp; Barack H Obama as an Englishman ( his white mother is of English descent)

								2. Anderson Silva is the undisputed pound for pound best fighter in the world. The stats &amp; popular opinion prove it. You must be the only person who believes otherwise. He outscores St Pierre.

								3. Poster # 52 : that&rsquo;s a cop out. Next you will add just about every sport that is dominated by a non white in your &#8220;rigged&#8221; list. And perhaps even go so far as to remove the &#8220;rigged&#8221; tag if that sport is dominated by a white. So is Ice Hockey rigged too ? The sour grapes complex does not do the trick, sir!

								For heaven sakes, this guy ( World Boxing Champion is an Ethnic Kazakh &hellip;of mongol admixture that explains their dark looks) clearly looks Central Asian, more like an Iranian, Afghan or a Northern Indian as opposed to the archetypal European white. A Caucasian for sure, but a European white ? No way!

								And for anyone who claims Royce Gracie is &#8220;white&#8221; ? He is mixed race but tends to look very ethnic &amp; dark skinned. Just like Obama, another mixed race individual with dark ethnic looks.
