<h1>OPS Buys 8,000 Diversity Manuals</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Dejka, Omaha World-Herald, July 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Omaha Public Schools used more than $130,000 in federal stimulus dollars to buy each teacher, administrator and staff member a manual on how to become more culturally sensitive.</p>
<p>The book by Virginia education consultants could raise some eyebrows with its viewpoints.</p>
<p>The authors assert that American government and institutions create advantages that &#8220;channel wealth and power to white people,&#8221; that color-blindness will not end racism and that educators should &#8220;take action for social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book says that teachers should acknowledge historical systemic oppression in schools, including racism, sexism, homophobia and &#8220;ableism,&#8221; defined by the authors as discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Omaha school board approved buying 8,000 copies of the book  &mdash;  one for every employee, including members of the custodial staff  &mdash;  in April. The decision to buy the book was made 11-0, with board member Mary Ellen Drickey passing on the vote.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Employees will be asked to read a couple of chapters each quarter and then meet in study groups to discuss the book using a study guide produced by the district, she said. For teachers, the study sessions will be a part of their professional development.</p>
<p>School board President Sandra Jensen said the district doesn&rsquo;t endorse everything in the book, nor does she expect employees to adopt the authors&rsquo; positions. The book is intended to open a dialogue, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The book that OPS bought, &#8220;The Cultural Proficiency Journey: Moving Beyond Ethical Barriers Toward Profound School Change,&#8221; includes a worksheet for teachers to score themselves on a continuum of cultural sensitivity. The continuum ranges from &#8220;cultural destructiveness,&#8221; as evidenced by genocide and ethnocide, to &#8220;cultural proficiency,&#8221; depicted as the highest level of awareness.</p>
<p>Only those educators who acknowledge the existence of white privilege in America, that &#8220;white&#8221; is a culture in America and that race &#8220;is a definer for social and economic status&#8221; can reach proficiency, the authors contend. <br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The book says teachers must overcome irrational fear of homosexuality and reject the &#8220;color-blind&#8221; approach to teaching in which teachers treat all children the same. Instead, the group identity of students of color should be recognized and esteemed, the authors say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The authors  &mdash;  Franklin and Brenda CampbellJones and Randall B. Lindsey  &mdash;  all former teachers, write that their intent in the book is &#8220;to prepare educators to unshackle themselves from tradition and become facilitators for reconciliation of historical injustices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Franklin CampbellJones said in an interview that although some issues in the book are considered &#8220;challenging&#8221; and &#8220;taboo,&#8221; discussing them is important to break down barriers to educating every child.</p>
<p>He said the book has been well-received by other school districts using it, including San Diego and Atlanta, and districts in Maryland and Canada.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Omaha school district has a racially diverse enrollment. Last year the enrollment was 35.7 percent Caucasian, 29.9 percent Hispanic, 29.7 percent African-American, 3.1 percent Asian-American and 1.6 percent American-Indian. Students speak 93 different languages, Omaha Public Schools officials say.</p>
<p>The district, like most across the country, has struggled to close stubborn achievement gaps between whites and minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When there are gaps in achievement between whites and minorities, schools need to identify obstacles to learning embedded in school culture, policies and practices, according to the study released by the Sociedad Latina and the University of Massachusetts&rsquo; Mauricio Gaston Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;ableism&#8221; That pretty much sums up the whole debate between those of us on this site and the people on the other side of the arguments. </p>
<p>Is it wrong to discriminate against someone because they are not able? Must the world be absolutely and utterly fair in every way that we can possibly make it, even if it means enacting a system that is the opposite of a meritocracy? </p>

		<p>The pathetic claim of black oppression will deserve credibility when: Blacks seek segregation, not integration; when they emigrate, not immigrate. There are many ways blacks an avoid whites but there is virtually no place where whites can escape blacks. No matter where he goes, the black man is sure to follow, if allowed.<br>

		<p>The agenda here is more subtle than you might think.</p>
<p>Train all employees into the Diversity Mandate.</p>
<p>Then, whenever a problem arises, fall back on the lesson plan and have cover for blaming Whitey for just trying to horde and protect their ill gotten gains from their racist White privilege system that oppresses and marginalizes the blacks.</p>
<p>These programs aren&rsquo;t designed to cause immediate change, but just to lay the groundwork so that Whites can&rsquo;t function without being called raciss, and they will eventually give into the pressure, because no other Whiteys will rally around and defend them.</p>
<p>Isolate and crush- that&rsquo;s the plan.<br>

		<p>Public schools use of books like &ldquo;The Cultural Proficiency Journey: Moving Beyond Ethical Barriers Toward Profound School Change&rdquo; to train teachers and other employees in the ideology of &#8220;social justice&#8221; and &#8220;white privilege&#8221; parallels the use of public school textbooks to accomplish that purpose.</p>
<p>Publishers who hope to sell textbooks to our goverment schools systems all use comically elaborate &ldquo;bias and sensitivity guidelines&rdquo; – some of which, with great difficulty, education research professor Diane Ravitch was able to obtain. Below is her description of the guidelines of publishing giant McGraw-Hill:</p>
<p>&#8220;The MH guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &#8216;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &#8216;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;  (THE LANGUAGE POLICE, p44) </p>
<p>If a publisher did not use such guidelines it runs a high risk of not getting its textbook offerings accepted by state textbook adoptions committees which are highly sensitive to the demands of ethnocentric pressure groups.</p>

		<p>I sure would like to experience some of this &#8220;white privilege&#8221; that the left and blacks spend so much time talking about.  I would also like to see a single example of the &#8220;oppression&#8221; of blacks.  <br>
I served in the military and then with federal civil service for the past 30 years.  Many qualified whites, including myself, were passed over for promotion while ridiculously unqualified minorities and women were promoted into positions for which they were clearly unqualified.  When they couldn&rsquo;t do the work, their work was parceled out among the various lower paid white males while the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; spent their days coming in late, playing on the computer, taking long lunches, and leaving early (with not reduction in pay, of course).</p>
<p>And they wonder why so many white men are enraged.  </p>

		<p>I doubt that most of the people who will receive these books have ever ready any real book in their entire lives.  &#8220;Discussions&#8221; of the book will simply be group indoctrination of the usual easily taught basics:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s all whitey&rsquo;s fault&#8221;<br>
&#8220;Whitey gots to pay&#8221;<br>

<p>I would be curious to read the part that explains how &#8220;White&#8221; culture is anathema to &#8220;people of color,&#8221; who could build such beautiful socially just societies without all that evil white interference.</p>

		<p>This is the flaw, the holy grail of flaws, with socialist thinking in the matter of education&hellip;see, the socialists have these retardedly over the top formulas and explanations of why there are gaps between &#8220;cultural groups&#8221; (i hate that term BTW). Their view is that the teacher did something to hinder the progress of the students that were lacking. In their progressive model world, the teacher didn&rsquo;t address didn&rsquo;t address the student&rsquo;s cultural needs or background. Apparently they&rsquo;re trying to break down the cultural standards to unlock the inner learner in EVERY student. There&rsquo;s just one part of the equation that was left out of their perfect world model. The child&hellip;.has any of these morons ever thought that perhaps, maybe by some off chance that the child just doesn&rsquo;t want to learn? Sure they may have all the potential in the world, but it takes the commitment on the child&rsquo;s part to make the rest of their equation work.  If the kid doesn&rsquo;t want to learn, he doesn&rsquo;t want to learn. Let him drive the fry o lator. Somebody has to do it, right? This is what I hate about the modern school system. Everyone has to get a trophy, everyone has to have their day in Tue sun&hellip;.Ummm&hellip;.no, they don&rsquo;t. In fact, that&rsquo;s what all the celebration and pomp and circumstance is for when a student does achieve a goal through hard work. It is a slap in the face to the ones that do work hard to see someone that has done diddley squat and still receive recognition for it. Is it just me or is our education system just striving for mediocrity at this point?</p>

		<p>Some months ago I read a story on AMREN about books being required reading in all American schools. Something to do with understanding diversity and the evils of White privilege. One particular book was hyped so I googled it and then spent a few of my good old English pounds to buy a pristine copy. &#8216;From Slave Ship To Freedom Road&rsquo; by Julius Lester &amp; Rod Brown published by Penguin. Nice quality, excellent colour paintings. So which black american company printed it? Well, obviously none could be found as it was manufactured in China. It is totally racist and only produced and distributed to schoolchildren simply to stir up hatred in blacks (I suppose I should say &#8216;african-americans&rsquo;) against Whites about an historical event which ignores all and every social advancement since. I bought it not just for my own edification but to show to a few teachers in England (without any forewarning or comment by me) to observe their reaction.  Be they White, Brown or Black, not one could believe this propaganda is being stuffed into the minds of American children as part of everyday lessons. They liked the pictures and could readily see what an impact these would have on a developing mind.  BTW, I am in no way &#8216;plugging&rsquo; this piece of propaganda and I doubt very much if any american black ever bought a copy as it was handed out for free in schools. I would love to know if any AMRENER has any knowledge about it and the effect on their own White children, if indeed any ever read it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I would love to know if any AMRENER has any knowledge about it and the effect on their own White children, if indeed any ever read it&#8221;</p>
<p>My mixed race son had to read, let me try and remember it &#8220;trouble don&rsquo;t come easy&#8221;. A fictional account of how bad blacks had things, and still have things, I suppose the assumption is. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Employees will be asked to read a couple of chapters each quarter and then meet in study groups to discuss the book using a study guide produced by the district, she said. For teachers, the study sessions will be a part of their professional development.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what my armchair repub friends fail to understand everytime they bash us teachers and accuse us ALL of needing less and less tenure and rights.</p>
<p>Those who are in charge of our systems are disgusting liberals.<br>
Those who are principals and other administrators are mostly disgusting liberals who couldn&rsquo;t handle the job of teaching.</p>
<p>If you know of a good administrator in an URBAN setting  &mdash;  -you are lucky.</p>
<p>As teachers  &mdash;  we have no friends. <br>
The dems want to brainwash us with this garbage.<br>
The right is just as clueless as to what we do.<br>
I am very conservative and also race aware and I am a teacher.<br>
This type of brainwashing foolishness has been going on for years. <br>
Most of us shug it off  &mdash;  because if you are perceived by the liberal elite administration (WHICH THE CONSERVATIVE RIGHT CONTINUALLY BACKS UP FOR SOME STUPID REASON)to be against the brainwashing  &mdash;  -then  &mdash;  -you are magically found to be an ineffective teacher and (THANKS TO OBAMA/DUNCAN AND THE ENTIRE RIGHT) you are fired after 2 years of thinking for yourself.</p>
<p>As conservative as I am I must say  &mdash;  -my beloved right wing patriots have GREASED THE SKIDS for the liberals to push out white teachers who dont swallow the medicine.<br>
 <br>
In an astounding effort to wage a war on what the right perceives as &#8220;ineffective/lazy and most of all liberal&#8221; teachers, they have undermined all of us conservative white teachers and have tilled the garden in terms of allowing the libs to plant whatever garbage they desire in our young people. I live with this everyday.<br>
Thanks for reading, <br>
I can&rsquo;t write my name cause if discovered by my district, could be fired for contributing to what they consider a racist organization. Im 35 and have 20 years left on my mortgage.<br>
Thanks for understanding and God Bless.</p>

		<p><i>Public schools use of books like &#8216;The Cultural Proficiency Journey: Moving Beyond Ethical Barriers Toward Profound School Change&rsquo; to train teachers and other employees in the ideology of &#8216;social justice&rsquo; and &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; parallels the use of public school textbooks to accomplish that purpose.</i></p>
<p>The bibles of ed school are Bill Ayers, <i>To Teach: The Journey of a Teacher</i>  and uber-marxist Paulo Freire <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i>  Classes in cultural sensitivity/White privilege are mandatory.</p>
<p><i>Some months ago I read a story on AMREN about books being required reading in all American schools. Something to do with understanding diversity and the evils of White privilege.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Yorkshireman</p>
<p>Diversity and White privilege are woven throughout the curriculum in ALL state-approved, textbooks -including math and science books   &mdash;   all are chock-full of lessons about diversity and White perfidy.  I would venture to say the main theme of any given textbook is not math, science, lit, history, but rather non-White &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; and the evils of White privilege.  </p>
<p>Entire schools are now built around the theme of &#8220;social justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>I grabbed a typical, widely-used, California-state mandated 8th grade lit text off of the shelf to use as an example.</p>
<p>Ready?  Here is a sample of some of the selections (got yer barf bag handy?):</p>
<p>Theme: <i>Quest for Justice</i></p>
<p><i>Brown vs. Board of Education.</i><br>
<i>Saving the Wetlands</i><br>
<i>Gentleman of Rio en Medio</i><br>
<i>Raymond&rsquo;s Run</i> (black lit)<br>
<i>The Vision of Maya Ying Lin</i></p>
<p>Genre: <i>Nonfiction</i></p>
<p><i>The American Dream by Martin Luther King, Jr.</i></p>
<p>Theme: <i>From Sea to Shining Sea</i></p>
<p>Choice: <i>A Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</i><br>
<i>Ellis Island</i><br>
<i>Achieving the American Dream</i> by Mario Cuomo<br>
<i>The New Colossus by Emma Lazarus</i></p>
<p>Genre: <i>Poetry</i></p>
<p><i>Harlem Night Song</i> by Langston Hughes<br>
<i>Ode to Enchanged Light</i> by Pablo Neuruda<br>
<i>Two Haiku</i> by Basho and Moritake<br>
<i>For My Sister Molly</i> by Alice Walker</p>
<p>Genre: <i>Drama</i></p>
<p><i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i></p>
<p>What? You were expecting something different?</p>
<p>As you can see Asians are coming on strong in their demand to be included as one of many &#8220;victim&#8221; groups of White racism.  In California, lessons about &#8220;Asian internment during WW II&#8221; are very common  &mdash;    including selections featured prominently on state tests. I see <i>Farewell to Manzanar</i>  repeatedly in state texts on constantly on the state tests.</p>
<p>Do you now have all the evidence you need to homeschool your children?</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to add my 2 cents worth to (14-Dave). His experience in federal employment is the rule and not the exception. As a contractor, I saw far too many Blacks who were making salaries in excess of $90,000 a year who did nothing for their salary. In fact, many of them were (barely) high school graduates (after 15-20 years government employment) and barely had a 6th grade education. As Dave experienced, either the work got done by white males or contractors were hired to do the work that taxpayers were already paying black workers to complete. </p>
<p>Whites can&rsquo;t fight back. If you dared question a decision (or the competency) of a Black, you were in trouble.  Senior managers were too scared to confront incompetent Blacks because of the ramifications.  Blacks wouldn&rsquo;t get mad, they wouldn&rsquo;t accept that maybe they were overpaid and incompetent, they would get even and file an EEO compliant. All you have to do is look at the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) which is 43% Black (when OPM said in 2008 that the right number would be about 7.8%). Nearly 50% of all the people employed throughout government in the EEO business are Black.  When you add in the DOJ &ldquo;Civil Rights Division&rdquo; agenda, Whites don&rsquo;t stand a chance&hellip;unless someone with deep pockets and guts steps up to the plate and raises the bull flag.</p>
<p>Black public employees have been allowed to use Federal tax dollars to push an agenda that continues to enslave other Blacks in the mindset that their shortfalls are everyone else&rsquo;s fault but theirs. Who in Nebraska with the money, the guts and the correct sense of duty, will call the Bluff on the Omaha School system and force these books to be withdrawn and the tax dollars that purchased these refunded? BTW, don&rsquo;t expect the Federal Government to say anything.  The &ldquo;Department of Education&rdquo; is 37% Black (when OPM says that 9% is the &ldquo;fair share.&rdquo;<br>
