<h1>Malcolm X&rsquo;s Daughter, Malikah Shabazz, Gets Five Years Probation for Swindle of Elderly Widow</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Zambito, NY Daily News, July 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Malcolm X&rsquo;s youngest daughter was sentenced to five years probation today for swindling an elderly widow out of $55,000 by running up charges on her credit card.</p>
<p>Malikah Shabazz, 46, has been ordered to pay back the money she stole or risk being thrown into prison for seven years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shabazz pleaded guilty to first-degree identity theft last month.</p>
<p>Queens District Attorney Richard Brown accused Shabazz of &#8220;preying upon the trusting nature&#8221; of Khaula Bakr, a family friend and widow of one of the slain civil rights leader&rsquo;s bodyguards. Prosecutors say she opened credit card accounts in Bakr&rsquo;s name. </p>
<p>Bakr, 70, discovered the theft when she got a letter from her bank demanding nearly $30,000 in payments for an overdue account.</p>

		<p>I tell you, the X family sure knows how to walk a straight line?  Grandpa X sure preached about morality and rectitude everywhere he went, yet his daughter turns out to be a hustler and his grandson arsonized the house with his wife in it at the time, killing her.</p>

		<p>I guess blood is thicker than water, as they say&hellip; Before he became involved in the Black Muslims, and became a famous activist, Malcolm X was a hustler, after all.</p>

		<p>Five years probation for very severely cheating an elderly person? That is it? Usually a crime committed against a senior citizen is considered an egregious offense and you get triple the amount of punishment or something like that. NOT even in this case prison. And as for paying back the money stolen, forget it. That cheated person will be lucky to EVER see a cent of what was taken. Malcolm Little [X] really taught his kids well, didn&rsquo;t he?</p>

<p>Right, the Little [X] family has continued to have a lot of problems ever since the death of Mal.</p>
<p>The other daughter of Malcolm Little [X] conspired to kill Louis Walcott and the grandson was an arsonist who burned his grandmother so badly she died. Of course in an earlier version of his life the grandfather [Malcolm Little] was not noted for his &#8220;morality and rectitude&#8221; that much either. So it runs in the Little household.</p>

		<p>Back in the early 90&rsquo;s during the Malcolm X fad, I read an article in a John Birch Society publication about Malcolm X. According to the article, even MX&rsquo;s street cred was in question, and that he was only dimly remembered by old-timers as having been a johnwalker.</p>

		<p>Malcolm X exemplifies part of what is wrong with black America.</p>
<p>He was a woman-hating pimp.  A black feminist wrote an expose about how the so-called white supremacist &#8220;Sofia&#8221; was treated.  Devil in a blue dress?  I think not.  He actually beat her senseless &#8220;to keep her in line&#8221; and made her support him financially.</p>
<p>Then for some reason, his goody two-shoes girlfriend Laura became a prostitute.  I think she found a rebound boyfriend who pimped her out.  Either that or she wanted his attention.</p>
<p>Then he controlled his wife Betty, not knowing anything about her except that she was &#8220;a good wife and mother.&#8221;  What are her personal interests and hobbies?  What are her opinions?  No one knows, because she lived in the shadows.  Of course she had to be a perfect angel while he could have an extremely checkered past.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t just break into people&rsquo;s homes (black and white).  He was also a male prostitute, which the macho Nation of Islam, Alex Haley, and Spike Lee refuse to admit to.</p>
<p>And for all that he&rsquo;s called a &#8220;civil rights leader&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now his children and grandchild are just like him.  One put a hit out of Louis X like someone else mentioned.  Another is found guilty of identity theft.  The grandson is an arsonist.</p>
<p>Is this the best black people can do?  I vote yes.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to believe Malcolm X has been dead this long.  I can&rsquo;t believe his youngest daughter is 46.  I was just thinking about him this morning.  Well, good riddance.</p>

By the fact that she stole this large amount of money, one would assume that she has no legitimate source of income of her own.</p>
<p>Thus, lacking any personal income, how is she going to pay the stolen money back?</p>

		<p>All those 60s radical black militants like Stokley Carmichael, Bobby Seals, Elder Cleavage, and Malcolm X sure helped their cause didn&rsquo;t they? And so many stupid White liberal kids bought into the hateful garbage they spewed out, mostly against The Man and The System&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think this was the daughter that was banging a white FBI informant. I remember when the affair came to light one of the black Muslims said &#8220;Malcolm must be turning over in his grave.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Back in the early 90&rsquo;s, Spike Lee said that the &#8220;Autobiography of Malcolm X&#8221; was the most important book that he will ever read&hellip;..I kinda have my doubts that there are a lot of books in Spike Lee&rsquo;s library that would vie for that distinction.</p>

<p>Malcolm Little is the birth name. Mal in his early life was a homosexual rapist and a homosexual prostitute who lived with a rich young white man. Mal had been hired as a &#8220;valet&#8221; and catered to the outrageous sexual demands of the young but very rich white man.<br>

		<p>Well, all you have to do is look at the name &#8220;Shabazz&#8221; - right away you KNOW where THAT comes from   &mdash;   phony black &#8220;Islamic&#8221; name.  And, well, lower class blacks don&rsquo;t really care WHO they cheat, as long as they get something for nothing.  Sociopaths all.</p>
