			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jodi S. Cohen, Chicago Tribune, July 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chicago State University, which was at risk of losing its accreditation because of troubling enrollment and retention figures, intentionally let failing students stay on the rolls to boost its numbers, a Tribune investigation found.</p>
<p>Chicago State has a policy that students with a grade-point average below 1.8 will be dismissed &#8220;for poor scholarship,&#8221; but records obtained by the newspaper show students were allowed to continue registering for classes with GPAs as low as 0.0.</p>
<p>By not enforcing its own policy, CSU permitted untold numbers of students   &mdash;   perhaps hundreds   &mdash;   to remain enrolled. The school dismissed 298 undergraduates at the end of this past spring term, the same time the Tribune began asking for data on student grades.</p>

		<p>This is university is headed by the illustrious Wayne Watson, an African American &#8220;History Maker&#8221; according to one web site. Prior to Watson&rsquo;s controversial appointment to the beleaguered Chicago State position, which was opposed by students and faculty members both, he served as the Chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago for approximately one decade. After his departure, it was decided that the City Colleges desperately needed to be &#8220;reinvented&#8221; to salvage the institution. Fewer than ten percent of the City College students managed to graduate with associate&rsquo;s degrees. </p>

		<p>They were kept on the rolls because funding is based on the number of student attending? Inner city schools, by the way, have greater funding per student than whiter more suburban schools. You&rsquo;ll never read this fact in the newspaper or learn this in the classroom. You&rsquo;ll learn quite the opposite idea. </p>

When I was in 8th grade physics class we had a black classmate I&rsquo;d swear was the missing link. At the end of one academic quarter, with a total of 700 points possible, he wound up with a grand total of 66.</p>
<p>I never knew what happened to him, as I was accepted into a private school the following year, but I assume the teacher passed him to get rid of him as is typical in this kind of situation.</p>

<p>Agreed, it&rsquo;s much tougher to get good grades in high achieving schools. On the total opposite end of the spectrum of Blacks are Asian dominated schools where whites, who would have done really well in a &#8216;white school&rsquo; are forced to drop out due to the fact that they can&rsquo;t meet the high Asian standards. White kids look disciplined and slow compared to studious, intelligent Asian kids. <br>
HOW do liberals explain this?</p>

<p>Anonymous (#4) is right. Like public K-12 schools, funding for places like this is based on enrollment. What the kids learn (if anything) is irrelevant.</p>

		<p>This institution was founded in 1867 and formerly served as a normal school designed to educate future public school teachers in Cook County, Illinois. The name of the college was later changed when the City of Chicago annexed the community where the campus was located. Believe it or not, the college, which later became a university and was renamed Chicago State, had a favorable reputation at one time.</p>
<p>During the Seventies, the demographics of the South Side of Chicago changed and the number of white students attending this university dropped in dramatic fashion and the student population soon became almost exclusively black. Barack Obama&rsquo;s political mentor, former Illinois State Senate President Emil Jones seized control of the university and began using it as a political patronage plantation and this further compromised the academic atmosphere at Chicago State University. One of the new buildings on campus was named for Jones. </p>
<p>When Wayne Watson was appointed, over the protests of students and faculty members, dissidents appealed to Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to intervene at Chicago State. Quinn, a political coward, was desperate for black votes in 2010 since he was facing difficult challengers in the primary and general elections, so he ignored the crisis at Chicago State to appease the black politicians in Chicago.     </p>

		<p>this is as much an financial scam as it is a race one - the race card has been used to shield financial scams from scrutiny. it is no accident that the civil rights movement (so called) flowered just after civil service reform reached its height. With objective civil service examinations and standards, the democrats lost their main cash cow, but now its back, stronger than ever, and we are probably more corrupt than tammany hall days. </p>

		<p>In April an auditor revealed that Chicago State wasn&rsquo;t billing its students among other problems:</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;the scathing audit portrays the 7,000-student university as a financial mess, with federal grants misspent, lax control over contracts and misuse of purchasing cards. The review revealed 41 problems, up from 13 the prior year.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is definitely a major scam on more than one level, the Machine Democrats have taken over these institutions and they are enrolling &#8220;students&#8221; with little or no prospects of completing their degrees and repaying their student loans. There is constant pressure applied to faculty members to dumb down their courses and inflate grades to keep enrollment numbers up and thereby allowing the Federal and state dollars to keep rolling in. </p>
<p>For the select few who do graduate, they can worm their way into various public positions using their counterfeit credentials and diploma privileges. Blacks love to gravitate towards government work. </p>
<p>Lastly, the fake university is a patronage haven for all types of workers from the custodians on up, including the bogus affirmative action administrators and faculty members with mail order or online diplomas. </p>

<p>This could be at least partially due to the fact that it is mostly high IQ Asians who immigrate to the US.  It may also be that East Asians tend to have a higher IQ on average then whites.  If that is the case, then it is proof that average IQ alone isn&rsquo;t necessarily a  good predictor of how functional a society is.   Otherwise the Industrial Revolution and the rise of democracy and human rights would have happened in China before it happened in white countries.  <br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s even sadder is that colleges and companies will offer these abysmally low-performing scholars better opportunities than what is extended to my son with a 3.7 GPA. One of my son&rsquo;s friends, a full-blooded American Indian, was given a scholarship to college despite a 650 total SAT score. And before anyone asks, he is not an athlete, either. </p>
<p>It is absolutely insane to pretend that these minority students are given less opportunity and advantages than white students.</p>

<p>Where are you getting your statistics? I studied engineering at a polytech some years ago. I won&rsquo;t mention the university by name, but I would say it was similar to Cal Poly. There was a mixture of races. On average, the Asians did not do any better or worse than the whites. The Asians were hardworking and intelligent&hellip;but so were the whites. We didnt all drop out because we couldn&rsquo;t compete with them. You are not more intelligent than us.</p>

		<p>Same thing happened with CCNY, City College of New York. Until about 1960 when it was swarmed by blacks it was well known and the highest achieving community college in the country.</p>
<p>In the thirties and forties CCNY had the highest percentage of students going on to receive PhDs than any other college in the country including Harvard, MIT and Cal Tech.</p>
<p>It is now a crime ridden holding area for students with IQs below 80.  The campus has a huge rape and robbery rate.  Most teachers are the sponsors of the numerous campus advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Why the change?  From poor White students to poor and middle class black students.  CCNY is also a perfect scam for young offenders.  Their attorneys get them out on bail and advise them to sign up for CCNY classes. When the trial finally comes around the fact that they are students is argued to convince the jury that such a fine young man is turning his life around.</p>
<p>If by chance the thug is convicted, he can&rsquo;t sent to prison because it would interrupt his studies.</p>
<p>Many of the black men at these free community colleges are criminals on probation or parole because either going to school or working is a condition of parole.  There is also the Pell and other grants.  It is ideal for the girls.  Have a baby and get all the welfare benefits plus about $5,000 per year in Pell and other grants for education that are not deducted from the welfare payments.<br>

<p>Something is wrong here, very wrong.</p>
<p>When the genius of blacks can&rsquo;t take them above a 1.0 average what happened? Maybe the tests are Racist?</p>
<p>Are there any questions about Rap Music or Bling in them?</p>
<p>Or are they just a link in mankind that never advanced beyond the jungle stage? I don&rsquo;t know and I am not saying. I am just asking.</p>

		<p>An &#8220;education&#8221; at Chicago State is of no more value than the curriculum at some correspondence university advertised on the inside of a matchbook.  This is but another example of how higher education adapts itself to black intelligence rather than the other way around.  Of course, given the latter scenario, most blacks would never be admitted in the first place, since they can&rsquo;t adapt.  </p>

		<p>These kinds of &#8220;bookkeeping&#8221; schemes are so rife at the inner<br>
levels of urban public schools that seemingly hard data about<br>
narrowing racial achievement gaps, etc. etc., should always be<br>
viewed as suspect.  Short of legal discovery powers attendant to Court actions, there is almost no way to pry down into the specific facts and figures.  If these sorts of data games were<br>

		<p>The White students fled, White home-owners move, White-owned businesses close, Whites stay away from (pick your place). Hmmm&hellip;I see a trend here. Wonder if blacks will ever realize we don&rsquo;t want to have ANY contact with them. They hate us so much but pursue us to no end. Force, demand, sue, beat, cajole, anything to get Whitey&rsquo;s attention and revenge. I was taught not to hate and have done well in that department most of my life. Those days are over.<br>

		<p>Chicago State was a predominantly black institution long before the 1970s. It was used in the 1950s and 1960s to provide black teachers for black public schools in Chicago.</p>
<p>The institution has a long tradition of mediocrity, more likely whatever realms lies below the mediocre. The range at this type of institution is tremendous. At the bottom, people who do not belong in college at all. Still, there are capable students and I am sure overall a faculty capable of adequate undergraduate instruction.</p>
<p>The capable students are as good as the stronger students at a typical state college. What percentage they represent at Chicago State, I do not know. But they do have black students there who excel in their subjects, including in the sciences.</p>
<p>Why an institution like this exists is another question. I grew up in Chicago, and I see it more as a monument to the historic mistreatment of all Chicago&rsquo;s and Cook County&rsquo;s citizens by Illinois&rsquo;s public higher educational system going back to the 19th Century. Illinois has a number of excellent public colleges and universities, but all are located &#8220;downstate&#8221;.</p>
<p>Only in recent decades have Chicago State and its counterpart on the  North Side of the city, Northeastern Illinois University, been developed into any semblance of credible state colleges.</p>
<p>Still, there are many students there who are not, by normal standards, even adequate. I imagine the percentage must be pretty high.</p>

		<p>From the time of &#8220;camp followers&#8221; who trailed the Union army during the Civil War, the blacks have behaved like beggars and parasites. Whites were used as the hosts, whose blood fed the parasites.</p>
<p>A man once observed that if all of the whites vacated the USA and relocated to Greenland or the North Pole that within twenty years the blacks would squander all of the material wealth in North America and follow the white man. </p>
<p>Africa is one of the wealthiest continents, but, without the colonial powers, the native blacks were unable to capitalize on the resources.  </p>

<p>What you are saying is not fully accurate as far as I know. Many, probably most, of Chicago&rsquo;s black teachers in the 1950s and 1960s came from Chicago State. At a certain point, white students virtually stopped attending the institution. The number of students other than black is is small today, I think maybe 15 percent.</p>
<p>The state has expended a great deal of money developing the institution and it does have some credibility as a college. But the situation there is undermined by the fact that many attendees lack adequacy as college students and the fact many people will not consider going there because of the community, demographics of the student body and concerns about the quality of the institution.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you are from the Chicago area, but the situation with Chicago State is, as I noted, as more an artifact of how Chicago and Cook County were treated by the state of Illinois prior to the 1970s as it is of any other factor. Chicago State and its derivative institution Northeastern Illinois remain the only state colleges within the city limits of Chicago. The state built a University of Illinois campus in Chicago in the late 1960s, but that is a different type of institution than an ordinary state college.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Agreed, it&rsquo;s much tougher to get good grades in high achieving schools. On the total opposite end of the spectrum of Blacks are Asian dominated schools where whites, who would have done really well in a &lsquo;white school&rsquo; are forced to drop out due to the fact that they can&rsquo;t meet the high Asian standards. White kids look disciplined and slow compared to studious, intelligent Asian kids. <br>
HOW do liberals explain this?:&#8221;</p>
<p>Your post has no relevance to this story at all, but of course you can always be relied upon to submit the same Hindu propaganda, in virtually the same language and with the same link, regardless of its relevance to the issue at hand. When are you going to answer those who&rsquo;ve asked you why you need white nations to &#8220;excel,&#8221; and why you don&rsquo;t go back where you came from, so that you can live with your superior co-racialists? </p>

<p>The average IQ in India is about 80. But some of the 30,000+ endogamous groups in that subcontinent have extraordinarily high IQs. I think (and most here would not agree) that we should give US citizenship to as many of those as possible. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;m not keen to accept every motel-Patel&rsquo;s second cousin, brought in to do house-keeping  &mdash;  most of those would have IQs well below the white American mean.</p>
<p>Regarding HBCUs  &mdash;  all extremely inferior  &mdash;  the kind of school  you should keep your kid far away from. But we all know that here&hellip;</p>
