	<p>History will be made in New Mexico on Saturday as the National Hispanic Cultural Center hosts the first national Spanish spelling bee, education officials said.</p>
<p>The Education Department said students in fourth through eighth grades will compete for the honor of being the first-ever champion.</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
<p>Good point, I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. Spanish words are extremely easy to spell. The way you spell it is the way it sounds and way it sounds is the way you spell it, unlike English which can stump even native speakers. The only thing that might trip them up is if they don&rsquo;t speak Castillian which has the  lisp for the soft c and the z, so they could get confused with the soft c, z and s, but that&rsquo;s a minor problem compared to English. </p>
<p>Come to think of it, this is a pretty lame-brained idea. I never heard of a spelling bee in Spain and I doubt they have them in Latin America. </p>
<p>Any of our readers have any insight on this?      <br>

		<p>Lets see if they rigg it so only hispanics are allowed to compete, or some South Asian or White wunderkid just memorizes a Spanish dictionary and dominates. The results could be amusing!</p>

		<p>This makes no sense.  You can&rsquo;t have a spelling bee in Spanish, it&rsquo;s pointless, and everyone will give the right answers.  Spanish spelling and pronunciation are identical and unambiguous.  If you can hear it, you can spell it.  Similarly, you can read, spell, and pronounce Spanish correctly (and even perfectly) without even comprehending the language.  There are no irregular spellings. </p>

		<p>This is actually comical, considering that Spanish is a nearly totally phonetic language.  Anybody who can speak it and knows the alphabet can spell in Spanish.  </p>

		<p>There are not spelling bees in Spain,that would be stupid.I am a spaniard and the only thing i see is many hispanicamericans confuse the use of s,z,c when writing in a forum.They pronounce it the same. You can easily know who is spanish and who is a &#8220;latino&#8221;.</p>

<p>You are perfeclty right. Those people are not Spaniards; they are what is called Mestizos (which they pronounce in their own particular way), people of mixed blood, whose culture is based on the culture of their Spanish conquerers.</p>

		<p>In, say, 50 years or so, will the New United States government have to send troops, when the majority population of &#8220;Nuevo Mexico&#8221;, take arms, put in jail Whites living on their territory, and declare that their state is now a Mexican province?</p>
<p>Seriously, I can imagine an era in the future, when White people will have no choice but to actually fight, to keep what they have.</p>
