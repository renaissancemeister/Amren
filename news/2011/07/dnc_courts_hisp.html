			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Newsmax, July 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is devoting its first television ad buy of the 2012 presidential race to a Spanish-language commercial, trying to persuade Hispanic voters in seven swing-state markets that President Obama has not failed them economically.</p>
<p>The spot, titled &#8220;En Quien Confiar (Who to Trust),&#8221; argues that Mr. Obama promoted tax cuts for the middle class while Republicans are interested in &#8220;protecting tax cuts for the very rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know who to trust, and who we can&rsquo;t. Because it&rsquo;s our job to protect our families,&#8221; the ad states.</p>
<p>Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida Democrat and DNC chairwoman, said the inaugural ad reflects the importance of Hispanic voters to her party&rsquo;s electoral success.</p>
<p>&#8220;This ad buy and the fact that it&rsquo;s the first one of the campaign season &hellip; sends a very strong signal of just how high a priority this community is to this administration and this president,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We know that the Hispanic community has grown across this country, and our commitment is to reach voters in every nook and cranny in this country.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Unfortunately those ads will probably mostly appear on Univision and other Spanish language media that the gringos don&rsquo;t watch.  Because if DNC Spanish language ads started appearing on the channels white people <i>do</i> watch it would wake up more white people and help the Republicans.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no question that Democrats rely upon Hispanic voters.  They are the anti-white party and everybody knows it.  That is why an illegal alien amnesty is so important to the Democrats.</p>

		<p>According to a recent Pew poll, the Democrats have lost 6 points among whites, but picked up the same number among Hispanics.  Even worse for Obama, whites aged 18-29 have indicated a 10-point loss.  Thus, it seems that Latinos are his only hope!</p>

<p>This can&rsquo;t be true&hellip;.(sarcasm). Aren&rsquo;t we told over and again by the talking heads on the right that &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are &#8220;conservative&#8221; by their own nature? That we just need to &#8220;reach&#8221; out to them and get them back to their &#8220;roots&#8221;&hellip;.we are told so many lies by the right as we are by the left.</p>
<p> Our local ( the Central Valley in Ca) &#8220;conservative&#8221; talking head praises the Mexican mothers as being the MOST conservative women of all time&hellip;.nary a word about praise for WHITE mothers or anything good about what White people have contributed to America. That would be &#8220;racist&#8221; in this moron&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p> He even marched with the ILLEGALS (whom he calls his friends and &#8220;conservative&#8221;) on a water issue for the farmers. Not to mention, having fund raisers for these farm workers (out of work)and ILLEGAL for the most part, so they can EAT, pay rent, and continue to STAY here. He defends and helps these mexicans at every turn.</p>

<p>YES! The same goes for ANY nonwhite in this country, including the blacks. </p>
<p>Until Whites wake up to this fact (and vote White only) we will keep on losing America. We need our own racially aware, White Party if we are to survive and if America is to survive. We are considered racists anyway so why not BE racist for our very survival.</p>

		<p>I work around a LOT of latinos.  I know many very well, and for years.  They generally are not here to be &#8220;Americans.&#8221;  They wear their nationalism for their home countries on their sleeves.  Even their American born children are generally steeped in &#8216;home country&rsquo; patriotism.</p>
<p>They are here for the &#8216;better life.&rsquo;  In other words, they want as much as they can take from the &#8216;gringos.&rsquo;  We don&rsquo;t protect our wealth and economy anymore.  The world is dipping its hands in our money bucket, and we&rsquo;re too busy with our XBoxes to notice.</p>
<p>When they are the majority, they will not think twice about violating the constitution, because they never cared for it anyway.  It was not created by their people, for their people.  President Pablo Vicencia, in the year 2034, signed an order today dissolving all national parks for land redistribution to farmers (ahem, cartel marijuana farmers).  The next latino president declared the Tequila Party the only legal party in the land&hellip;.</p>
