<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than a dozen men are set to go before a judge Wednesday in the horrific gang rape of an 11-year-old girl that has torn apart a small Texas town.</p>
<p>Fourteen men have been charged in the incident and are scheduled to be in a state district courtroom in Liberty for status updates. Five minors also face prosecution in the brutal attacks.</p>
<p>The vicious gang rape has exposed racial tensions in the town of nearly 9,000, as the suspects are all African-American while the victim, who is now 12, is Hispanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s segregating our community &hellip; the reaction is anger, devastation,&#8221; Brenda Myers  &mdash;  who knows the victim and runs the Community and Children&rsquo;s Impact Center in Cleveland, the town where the alleged sex crime occurred  &mdash;  told ABC News in March.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The girl later told police that she was raped on at least five occasions between September and December. Some of the attacks included seven to eight attackers.</p>

<p> And can you imagine the outcry if 14 White males were charged with raping a black 11-year-old, and family members of the defendants were quoted in the media as saying that the child &#8220;wanted it&#8221; and that it was &#8220;her fault&#8221;?</p>
<p> But then, we&rsquo;re always held to a higher standard. I suppose in a way we should take it as a compliment. As in, &#8220;Well, what can you expect from blacks? But White guys should know better &hellip;&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whites should have no skin in this game.  Any rape is an outrage, especially if it involves a minor and, worse, if it&rsquo;s a gang rape.  But if most whites are too terrified to draw the right conclusions about this case, you can believe that the Mexicans aren&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;d love to rip the black perps apart.  They just may.  </p>

		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s segregating our community &hellip; the reaction is anger, devastation,&rdquo; Of course it is segregating the community and there will be anger, the truth of the matter is that most of these communities should never have been desegregated in the first place, it just does not work.</p>
<p>I am sure other readers of this post will be thinking the same way as I am; Is this going to be the future of life in what was once a great white civilised nation, a breakdown of law and order and a return to savagery? </p>
<p>At least the Hispanic community is not frigtened to call a spade a spade and and put the blame where it belongs.</p>
<p>In two recent cowardly sexual assult/murder cases here in NSW country towns it was quite obvious who the culprits were even though the race of the accused was not mentioned. Then the Aboriginal legal service let the cat out of the bag by publicly stating that the accused were entitled to a fair trial away from the small towns where the crimes were committed.I might also add there is a  breakdown of law and order in these small towns, (Moree, Bourke, Brewarina, Walgett all in the NSW Outback) you just do not walk around them at night and if you own a business you put up the shutters at sunset. Yes they all have a big indigenous population.</p>

<p>Why would they be? Nobody would dare call them the racists they are. Hispanics, Mexicans in particular, hate blacks and make no bones about their feelings. But nobody will ever call them on it. Never! Not even when they kill each other over race, as is the case here in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>No, being called a &#8220;racist,&#8221; is exclusively reserved YT now; especially us Whites who believe in border security and US sovereignty. We are demonized at every turn by self-hating Whites and La Raza Hispanics, while the blacks and Hispanics go on killing each other because of their beliefs. <br>

		<p>It will be interesting to keep tabs on the defendents.  My guess is, within 5 to 10 years, not a single one will be alive&hellip;.each killed by El M, in prison.</p>

		<p>From the article: (AR, how could you miss that in the summary?)</p>
<p>&#8220;Them boys didn&rsquo;t rape her,&#8221; Angie Woods told the Houston Chronicle in April. &#8220;She wanted this to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So here we have it, black on white: It was all the fault of this 11-year old sexual predator, who lured 14 innocent men into all of this. Maybe a nice Sharia-style stoning will do justice?</p>

		<p>Hispanics in general have a well-developed sense of machismo, and I believe that blacks target them at their peril.</p>
<p>The Hispanic troopers I knew in my two tours in Vietnam were a pretty tough bunch you could count on in a tight spot.</p>
<p>I really believe that if it came down to some sort racial conflict with blacks that the Hispanics would prevail bloodily.</p>

		<p>Let them keep this kind of thing up and the Mexicans WILL give them what they&rsquo;re begging for,while most whites will still say &#8220;oh they&rsquo;re no different than us,they&rsquo;re our equals&#8221;.Don&rsquo;t get me wrong,I&rsquo;m not a big fan of hispanics either,but they&rsquo;ll give it right back to them and in spades!Congratulations black people of Texas,you&rsquo;re all targets now!And you know what,I don&rsquo;t feel even a little sympathy for any of you.</p>

		<p>I pity the girl.  Whether she &#8216;wanted it&rsquo; or not, this person is a minor and deserved better adult oversight.  That the attacks happened on five other occasions without notice of mood changes, extreme social withdrawal or outright panic at the thought of reentering social risk areas (school, mall, pool) where her victimizers could be lurking is beneath contempt and bordering on suspicious.</p>
<p>Having a &#8216;cross cultural zone&rsquo; area where this type of crime could be geographically perpetrated in communities where youth association across color lines is also frowned upon also sounds questionable.</p>
<p>The Hispanics&rsquo; I know are -very- family conscious in terms of pride by association and this as much as any racial hatred will bring the young woman shame and stigma for years and may decrease her eligibility for marriage and advance within her community.</p>
<p>Something doesn&rsquo;t add up.</p>
