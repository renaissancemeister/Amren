			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corey Dade, NPR, July 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Just as the Tea Party drew heavily on a public backlash against government spending, another new political movement  &mdash;  the Tequila Party  &mdash;  aims to use the latest crackdown on illegal immigration to motivate Latinos to vote in 2012.</p>
<p>Arizona Republican DeeDee Garcia Blase formed the National Tequila Party Movement as an answer to a Tea Party influence she blames for increased political opposition to immigration.</p>
<p>The group has no aspirations to become a third political party. Its focus will be registering as many of the nation&rsquo;s 21 million voting-age Latinos as it can, targeting young voters in presidential battleground states.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most of Blase&rsquo;s ire is reserved for Tea Party groups, which she believes have pushed state and congressional Republicans to adopt tougher positions against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no choice but to empower ourselves and work on a massive national movement to counter the message of the Tea Party. We believe the Tea Party is an anti-immigration movement,&#8221; Blase says.</p>
<p>Leaders of the largest national Tea Party groups have insisted their official platform is focused on cutting the federal budget and shrinking government.</p>
<p>Mark Meckler, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, one of the largest national groups of its kind, said immigration &#8220;isn&rsquo;t an issue for us.&#8221; He acknowledged that the organization&rsquo;s roughly 3,500 chapters take up a wider range of issues affecting their communities. He said he didn&rsquo;t know of any local affiliates that advocate on immigration policy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Tequila Party hopes the latest immigration struggles will prove to be a unifying force. Its strategy is to target young voters in 10 presidential battleground states, including Florida, Illinois and California.</p>

		<p>So the premise of this article is that Hispanic Americans oppose enforcing immigration laws.  To borrow a reference from one of yesterday&rsquo;s articles:  &#8220;That&rsquo;s racist!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Politically organizing Hispanics is hard enough, but organizing them to &#8220;take over&#8221; the Republican Party is an even harder sell, especially since they have a perfectly good welfare party called the Democrats.</p>
<p>Did you notice that the &#8220;boycott&#8221; talk regarding last night&rsquo;s All-Star Game in Phoenix was a big flop?  Once it became clear that it would be, the next trial balloon was to make both the AL and NL starting lineups all-Hispanic to poke Arizona in the eyes.  Except that MLB players, if they are Hispanic non-citizens, are on legal work visas (which Congress is making easier and easier to get for professional athletics, which has had the side effect of shutting whites out of MLB over time), so laws like SB 1070 are not germane here.  While their Dominican or Colombian birth certificates might be a bit suspect when it comes to the date of birth, no GM is going to want the PR headache of having been found out to have signed players in the country illegally.  They get the paperwork done and cover their bases (pun intended) to make sure that they&rsquo;re here legally on legal work visas.  It&rsquo;s one thing to have illegals working on an impromptu construction site, (and that&rsquo;s wrong enough), but it&rsquo;s another thing from a public perception standpoint to have one as your starting shortstop. </p>
<p>The (perhaps sad) reality is that the desire for people to &ldquo;stuff the ballot box&rdquo; in order to see all eighteen starters be Hispanic might not really matter.  For the major leagues are so predominately Hispanic that an all-Hispanic starting lineup in both leagues just might happen anyway based on the natural order of things, sort of like finding hay in a haystack.  Even if only non-political native born white Americans got to cast votes.</p>
<p>And if that doesn&rsquo;t help, all they needed to do to ensure an all-Hispanic National League starting lineup is to use the New York Mets.</p>

They complain about stereotypes and they adapt &#8220;The Tequila Party&#8221; as their name.</p>
<p>The Tea Party has connotations of being sober. The Tequila Party makes me think of drunk Mexicans.</p>

		<p>MLB sold out white America long ago! I refuse to so much as even watch a MLB game, much less attend one (even if you paid me)! Let the invading browns have MLB, since that&rsquo;s now the preferred demographic being marketed to by MLB.</p>
<p>Have at it!<br>

		<p>Way back in the 1960s my father was in law enforcement and talked alot with Mexican gang leaders locked up in prison.  The top leaders told him this whole scenario was planned for our future.  Poor hispanics would be forced into the US. and then used to take control of the border states with the idea that they would be controlled by the gang leadership and ultimately the states would reunite with mexico to form Greater Mexico.  In the year since nothing has happened it appears to alter this idea.  We are flowing along like stunned haddocks going along with the plan.  No white resistence exists worthy of the name  All that is slowing things is the inept organization of the hispanics.  Learned to speak spanish or stop the illegals is the simple choice.</p>

		<p>I can understand the human desire to get something you don&rsquo;t deserve.  In this case, for illegals, it&rsquo;s residency in the US and perhaps citizenship inclusive of of the social transfer payments benefits.  What I don&rsquo;t understand is why Puerto Rican&rsquo;s are invested in the Latino movement.  Puerto Rican&rsquo;s have automatic US residency and citizenship rights inclusive of all social payment transfer benefits.  Further Mexicans compete with them for jobs (although who cares about a job if you qualify for welfare).  What is in it for Puerto Rican&rsquo;s?  Perhaps in the future a solidarity in votes?  That is a bit far reaching to the average Puerto Rican, although their government representatives are wise to the idea.  Curious though as Puerto Ricans and Mexican don&rsquo;t mix when it come to living areas.  Maybe its they liken themselves to the black civil rights movements and the spoils that has bestowed on that under-performing group.</p>

		<p>Nice touch, &#8220;The Tequila Party&#8221;.  Anything else your culture is known for? <br>
The Tea Party was named after a group of revolutionaries that fought against oppression, that later blossomed into what is now known as the USA.  Images of self-determination, individualism, social-responsibility and sacrifice come to mind.  <br>
Tequila is a reference to hard liquor with an innovative worm at the bottom.  And &#8220;Tequila Party&#8221; is a double entendre as in a youthful drinking party noted for debauchery.  <br>
The choice of words speaks volumes.  And ironically, if a white person called the budding Latino Party the &#8220;Tequila Party&#8221; all sorts of hand-wring and wailing would occur, inclusive of demands for an apology and maybe a firing.  </p>
