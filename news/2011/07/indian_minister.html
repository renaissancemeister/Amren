			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rahul Bedi, Telegraph (London), July 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ghulam Nabi Azad&rsquo;s attack on &#8220;unnatural&#8221; same-sex relationships  &mdash;  delivered at a HIV conference  &mdash;  attracted particular hostility as he is charge of health policy in Asia&rsquo;s most Aids-afflicted nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though it (homosexuality) is unnatural, it exists in our country and is now fast spreading, making it tough to detect its spread,&#8221; Mr Azad told the conference in New Delhi, which was also attended by the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, Mrs Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress Party, senior cabinet members and MPs.</p>
<p>&#8220;With relationships changing, men are having sex with men now. Though it is easy to find women sex workers and educate them on sex, it is a challenge to find them (gay men)&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>His comments reflected a persistent culture of homophobia in socially conservative Indian society.</p>
<p>A 148-year old Victorian law declaring homosexuality to be a crime punishable by up to 10 years in jail and fines was only overturned by the courts two years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The minister needs to apologise immediately. He has insulted the entire homosexual community&#8221; Mohnish Kabir Malhotra, a gay rights activist said.</p>
<p>&#8220;His statement is completely outrageous and for a health minister it is surprising that he has not been through the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s guidelines in which homosexuality was taken off the list of diseases years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an effort at damage limitation, health ministry spokeswoman Shefali Sharan said Mr Azad&rsquo;s remarks were quoted out of context and that when he referred to &#8220;disease&#8221; he meant HIV-AIDS and not homosexuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not insulting anyone&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Anjali Gopalan, head of the NAZ Foundation that works with HIV positive victims, said: &#8220;In our line of work, the last thing we need is for some idiotic minister to make a statement like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which planet is he living on? Either he has no understanding of this issue, or he just doesn&rsquo;t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other activists noted that the minister&rsquo;s remarks would cheer servative groups and religious organisations who had virulently opposed legalising homosexuality in 2009.</p>
<p>Even the federal government  &mdash;  whilst presenting its side of the argument in the petition seeking to overturn legislation which considered homosexuality an &#8220;unnatural offence&#8221;  &mdash;  also termed it a &#8220;disease&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its counsel told the Delhi High Court that if legalised homosexuality would &#8216;devastate&rsquo; society as everybody would indulge in gay sex.</p>
<p>According to UNAIDS, India has some 5.7 million people infected with the Aids virus HIV, amongst the world&rsquo;s highest but activists maintain that gay sex is only marginally responsible for spreading the disease.</p>
<p>But in April the UN declared that India was witnessing a 50 percent drop in HIV-Aids cases as instances of new infections dropped from 24,000 per year in the beginning of the decade to 12,000 annually.</p>
<p>In a hastily-arranged press conference Mr Azad later insisted he had been misquoted. &#8220;My reference was to HIV as a disease. As health minister, I know (male homosexual sex) is not a disease,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>India is projected to be one of the most populous nations on the planet very soon.</p>
<p>So, to me   &mdash;   a sociologist who studies population phenomena   &mdash;   it makes sense that the level of homosexuality will also rise. </p>
<p>I am not a biologist or a neurologist, so I cannot make pronouncements in those areas, however - as a sociologist - I can assure you that there is documentation of homosexuality existing in one form or another in every culture and the larger the population of said-culture, the more widespread the homosexuality. Much of the homosexuality will be in committed, loving, same-sex relationships, but a great deal of it will also be more clandestine in nature, involving casual and risky encounters. The latter tends to be the type of homosexuality that spreads HIV. </p>
<p>The government, however, wants to penalize openly-gay, committed couples as &#8220;diseased&#8221;, but the truth is that it is the men having causal, risky encounters who spread the disease.</p>
<p>So, by persecuting open homosexuals, the government is actually compounding the problem. If anything, the government needs to target those who have casual risky sex, be it heterosexual or homosexual in nature. </p>
<p>Persecuting openly gay people is the worst thing they could do.</p>

		<p>It is NOT whites that are pushing for the mainstreaming of homosexuality. Many leftist whites are on board with the normalizing of homosexuality, but on par those LGBT advocates are not one to consider themselves white.  </p>

		<p>India has long been one of the most repressive societies with regard to women; women traditionally are expected to be subservient to men.  The practice of suttee, where the widow of the dead husband is expected to jump onto his funeral pyre and burn herself to death, is STILL practiced in some very isolated villages.  I am surprised that India is even aware of homosexuality, frankly.  But to call it a white or even gay disease is really ignorant.  It apparently originated somewhere in Africa, and there it is rampant as a heterosexually transmitted disease.  India is advanced far beyond richer and more outwardly sophisticated countries in spiritual realms, but it is woefully behind in areas such as medicine, psychology, human rights, technology, sanitation, etc. etc. etc.  And make no mistake - caste is still practiced, although there are efforts to restore the assigning of caste according to the talents and aspirations of the individual rather than simply by birth. &#8220;Birth caste&#8221; was a ruinous change of the original concept, brought on by ignorant ancient rulers.</p>

		<p>Personally, I feel badly for gays. I don&rsquo;t believe that they made any sort of conscious decision to pursue a gay lifestyle.  I don&rsquo;t think that they should be persecuted for something that&rsquo;s beyond their control</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&rsquo;m not favorably impressed with the celebration of their lifestyle, which we shouldn&rsquo;t forget, brought us AIDS and a dramatic increase in other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re gay, fine, that&rsquo;s your business.  But I don&rsquo;t want to see the gay lifestyle endlessly celebrated in parades, special media events and disgusting displays of what should be private behavior in public places.</p>

		<p>The Indian minister is completely correct.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong in the 1990s the movement to decriminalise homosexual acts was almost entirely instigated and led by white expatriates.</p>
<p>Many HK Chinese of course now accept it wholeheartedly because it is seen as the trendy thing to do.</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t have a problem with gays, but as a factual matter, what the Indian minister said is entirely correct.</p>
<p>You can take it as a good thing (whites are enlightening the rest of the world with their tolerance of unusual sexual behaviour), or as a bad thing (whites are trying to destroy non-white societies). Depends on your own personal perspective.</p>

&#8216;Whites are at the forefront of the push to mainstream homosexuality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This may due to the fact that those who are more likely to support gay rights tend to be educated, and  live in a society which is democractic and wealthy or somewhat wealthy. <br>
Well a greater percentage of  Whites than non-Whites are educated<br>
and live in such society. Remember that the world is a poor<br>
place with a sizeabe portion  having little or no education.</p>

<p>That is only true because homosexuals are such a small percentage of the population. In fact, sodomy is 500% more likely to result in infection than any other form of intercourse. Still, the odds of infection are only 0.5%. Slim odds, indeed, but certainly not risking one&rsquo;s life over. Don&rsquo;t be a fool, vulcanize your tool</p>

		<p>[3  &mdash;  GetBackJack wrote at 7:52 PM on July 7: The minister might not be that far off the mark with this one. Whites are at the forefront of the push to mainstream homosexuality]</p>
<p>GetBackJack makes a good point. While it is true that homosexuality exists in all countries in the world, white nations are leading eforts to normalize gay rights activism around the world. There are 86 countries around the world, which criminalize homosexuality. The European Union nations, under the leadership of France, have been using the UN as a tool to support the &#8220;UN Declaration on Decriminalization of Homosexuality&#8221;. Here is an article on the issue: https://news.change.org/stories/the-un-declaration-on-decriminalization-of-homosexuality</p>
<p>I have nothing against gay people. But this European campaign to normalize gay rights around the world, is causing white nations and white people to be held in contempt, in many non-wite countries around the world. Most white people in Europe and America, do not support the radical gay agenda. But their governments are supporting a radical gay rights agenda around the world. It is important for average whites to oppose the radical gay agenda, just as it is important for average blacks to oppose criminal elements among the back community. The white gay radicals have harmed the image of white people globally, in the same way in which black criminals have harmed the image of black Americans.</p>

		<p>To be fair, the Indian minister has a point. Have you ever seen an Arab or African country seeking to normalize homosexuality? Only the white countries are doing it.</p>
<p>Right, as if homosexuals need a contract to live together in a monogamous relationship. They should be happy that sodomy isn&rsquo;t illegal and stop shoving their sexuality in society&rsquo;s face. It&rsquo;s not like you ever see straight pride parades.</p>

		<p>I personally don&rsquo;t believe that homoeroticism is ever &#8216;safe&rsquo;, no matter how broadly or narrowly defined it&rsquo;s acceptance.  A man who is seen to be openly gay loses his masculinity and insults his wife&rsquo;s femininity at the same time.<br>
Thus the notion that you are looking at &#8216;high risk&rsquo; behaviors as the prominent vector for spreading HIV/AIDS is not a given only in unattached partnerships but also in down-low occasonalists who have a lifestyle they are very much attached to.<br>
Homosexuals have a much more licentious libido and are more forward about it, especially &#8216;in the community&rsquo; where it is accepted.  This too pushes the envelope.<br>
Where key genes related to female fecundity are found to also push male developmental psychology towards a female gender role (i.e. why homosexuality hasn&rsquo;t snuffed itself out, long ago, as a deleterious to the reproductive assurance of the geneline); high birth rate nations will always have to be looked at carefully because you are also likely _creating_ larger populations of latent gay men.<br>
Men who may not acknowledge their status until they are older, in a stabilized life/family/business partnership and thus create &#8216;double bubbles&rsquo; of ongoing STD bloom recursion, well beyond the youthful stupidity grouping as they are just picking up the habits of careful gays.<br>
Homosexuality is the epidemiological and sociological risk that never ends and the trade off: maintaining a high fertility gene in women that apparently effeminizes men, is no longer justifiable, IMO.</p>

<p>A part of  her monologue is; &#8220;Who says a liberal arts degree is useless?  I have a degree in Asian-American studies and it taught me one improtant thing.  How to blame Whites for everything.  Wish I had known that in high school.

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>I am with you!   Although I am homosexual, I too do not believe  in celebrating, promoting or (heaven forbid!) FORCING, homosexuality on any part of the population. Nor do I contest what is &#8220;normal&#8221;.  However, for one who is homosexual nonetheless, that  is just what you are, take it or leave it; and there is nothing you can do about it. It is simply a personal matter.  </p>
<p>Nor should any other type of sexuality be FORCED  on anyone else either, for that matter. It is/or should be everyone&rsquo;s own business, and none of anyone else&rsquo;s&hellip;. certainly not a government&rsquo;s.  Nor should anybody be penalized or persecuted for their orientation.   Just let people be as they are! I am not trying to &#8220;convert&#8221; anyone (or be converted); I would be quite happy just to be left alone to be myself.</p>
<p>Neither do I &#8220;vilify racially-conscious whites as ignorant and racist!&#8221;  I never would.   But it is understandable that some gays might do so, as a self-defensive reaction, after reading all  the pompous pronouncements and ignorant misunderstandings of posts (such as many of those  above) written by people who know absolutely NOTHING  about  the subject.</p>
<p>PS. For their enlightenment,  homosexuality is not something you DO; it is something you FEEL, something you ARE.  How can any government  outlaw a feeling, or outlaw being what you ARE?   Even if you never touched another person, no one can help being who they ARE or how they FEEL. It is our fate to be ourselves, all of us. We cannot be anything else.</p>
<p>White countries/western governments should certainly not be in the business of &#8220;promoting&#8221; homosexuality. But they are more advanced and humane than others; and they are commendable in acting to <i>reduce  prejudice and persecution</i> toward those individuals who are homosexual. So many people misconstrue eliminating persecution with encouragement and promotion!  They are utterly wrong.  Failing to persecute does not constitute promotion.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a white male who is attracted to other males (&#8220;gay&#8221;), and a big fan of American Renaissance.  Those of you who conflate homosexuality with liberalism are misguided.  There is nothing about homosexuality that requires one to be liberal - or conservative, for that matter.</p>
<p>I agree with John&rsquo;s comment:  There is no need to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; homosexuality in the streets.  It just is what it is.  I, for one, would love to see an end to the so-called gay &#8220;pride&#8221; parades.</p>

		<p>Mark #23   &mdash;   I too am gay, but female   &mdash;   and that&rsquo;s just how it is.  I would also LOVE to see the end of the &#8220;Gay Pride&#8221; parades and festivals.  These are just opportunities for extremists to exhibit themselves, and frankly I left the gay community as soon as they decided to include the transgender and bisexuals.  Too many freaks for me.  And, you heteros out there - I think that men who have sex with minors should have their testicles REMOVED on the first offense.  These sick dudes don&rsquo;t change; they should have their sexual abilities taken away permanently.  I mean, they geld horses, don&rsquo;t they?</p>

<p>The celebration of homosexuality in the street is viewed <br>
by some gays as similar to other groups taking pride  in their<br>
racial or ethnic group. Some public celebration<br>
include West Indian Parade, Puerto Rican Parade,and Saint Patrick <br>
Day. Many gays see themselves as just another group .<br>
Most nations do not have different groups celebrating their<br>
ethnicity. So it is less likely to see homosexuals in those <br>
nations celebration their sexual orientation.</p>

<p>That is a very good point.  Americans have been led by the nose and encouraged   &mdash;    by certain ideological elements (with their own agenda) who desire  to weaken our national  unity   &mdash;   to see ourselves as separate groups and to revel  in our &#8220;Diversity&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Non-western countries do not &#8220;celebrate&#8221; Diversity and would regard it as subversive.  Most other societies  (at least outside the white west) seek  to encourage a sense of national identity instead of emphasizing their differences and encouraging separateness.  </p>
<p>The gay groups and celebrations are just a part of this general <i>idealization of separateness and difference </i> that has been foisted upon us in recent decades (largely by the Democratic Party)  &mdash;   the ideal of a fractured  nation composed of many minorities,  WITH NO MAJORITY. </p>
<p>Having destroyed a clear sense of national or social unity, or any majority culture or consensus,  it becomes <i>all the easier to rule us that way</i> &hellip; when we see ourselves  only as members of small, self-interested groups having little in common with others.   &mdash;    Nothing but the right to vote and a piece of paper called citizenship.</p>

		<p>Looking at it logically (which of course they will not do!), one might expect that those countries (such as India) afflicted with unwanted billions of people and rampant birthrates, would view homosexuality as a possible alternative similar to birth control, which would offer some relief to their over-burdened, over-populated countries.</p>
<p>It is ironic that countries  (Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia, Pakistan, etc.) which rely largely on the West for their food and medication,  show little concern for their burgeoning populations and expect to ship their surplus here (to Islamize us).  Most of these countries suffer from severe soil erosion, deforestation, desertification, and over-population. Mexico too. Indeed, these places are largely deserts to begin with that are barren of everything    &mdash;   except rampant human fertility  (which we subsidize). </p>
<p>Homosexuality would at least offer them an outlet which would not produce more babies, in countries  teeming with humanity and unable to feed all the babies that they already have.</p>
<p>Theoretically, every person in China (thanks to Dubya Bush) is entitled to come here and receive automatic &#8220;refugee&#8221; status, if they merely claim opposition to China&rsquo;s (very sane) one-child policy.</p>
<p>As long as we  (and all the hand-wringing, generous West) continue to relieve the Third World of their teeming surplus of millions, they will  not be forced to confront realistic solutions to their over-population problem.  They will (like Mexico) simply export that nasty   problem to us, thus making it OUR nasty problem.</p>
<p>And whose fault is that?</p>
