			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Goad, Takimag, July 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In what&rsquo;s being described as the most extensive case of test-tampering in US public-school history, Georgia Governor Nathan Deal dropped an 828-page bomb on the state last Tuesday detailing fraud in Atlanta public schools that was so ineptly concealed, it suggests that many of the city&rsquo;s teachers are too stupid to be school janitors.</p>
<p>The report concluded that 178 Atlanta schoolteachers and principals  &mdash;  82 of whom have already confessed  &mdash;  either assisted students to cheat on the state&rsquo;s standardized competency tests or deliberately corrected wrong answers themselves. Of 56 Atlanta public schools examined, 44 were found to have engaged in statistically significant cheating.</p>
<p>For a decade, Atlanta&rsquo;s public schools had been depicted as a shining national star that dared leave no child behind as dedicated educators and their eager-to-learn pupils joined hands, chanted slogans, marched together, chest-bumped and fist-pumped one-another&rsquo;s self-esteem, established a clear vision, looked to the future, kept their eyes on the prize, and made countless other ultimately hollow gestures. For a decade, it seemed as if Atlanta was a real-life example of every cloying Hollywood movie where loving-yet-stern teachers grabbed gaggles of shiftlessly misbehaving urban youngsters by the scruffs of their necks and taught them that teaching was something worth being taught and that learning was a valuable thing to learn.</p>
<p>Then it occurred to people with a basic grasp of &#8216;rithmetic that the reputed gains were too good to be true. In one implausibly stellar year at one school, eighth-graders whose scores exceeded basic math standards leapt from 1% to 46%. At another, English scores suddenly catapulted 51% higher. At another, math scores rocketed up 62% from the previous annum. At another school, special-ed students were suddenly scoring higher than gifted students in math.</p>
<p>One student passed the exam while reportedly being unable to read the word &#8220;cat.&#8221; Another left an entire section blank and passed. Another slept through the entire test and passed. Another sat under his desk, refused to take the test, yet still passed.</p>
<p>It was an educational miracle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Multiple interviews revealed that some teachers seated lower-scoring students behind gifted students so they could copy their answers. In oral exams, teachers would drastically change their vocal inflections to suggest which multiple-choice answer was correct. Others would simply point to the correct answers. Others would read them aloud. At several schools, teachers would change incorrect answers by hand after students had completed their tests. In one instance, teachers gathered together for a weekend &#8220;changing party&#8221; at one instructor&rsquo;s home and corrected faulty answers en masse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those with a financial and/or ideological stake in America&rsquo;s public-schools system have blamed mandatory testing for creating &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; standards based on the daffy-assed concept that children should graduate from school with basic competency in reading and math  &mdash;  standards that didn&rsquo;t seem unreasonable a generation ago and aren&rsquo;t deemed preposterously rigorous anywhere else in the industrialized world today. To these condescendingly anti-intellectual idealists, school is a place where children come to live and explore and create and be inspired and touch and smell and dance and feel and have their self-worth validated  &mdash;  it is most definitely NOT a place where they should learn to read and write and add and subtract. And what dizzy bastard came up the demented notion that school is a place where children are administered tests?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is it possible that some of these classrooms are filled with kids who are as fundamentally stupid as a dented box of rusty lug nuts? No, it&rsquo;s the system, the parents, the corporations, the Republicans  &mdash;  anyone but those unblemished little blank slates who crave knowledge but are cruelly denied it. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since they  &mdash;  and not I  &mdash;  were the ones who brought up this culturally touchy subject, I will note that every picture I&rsquo;ve seen of every educator named in this report is of African ancestry. And many of the teachers&rsquo; names  &mdash;  lively handles such as SuJuana, Raqketa, Chynel, Tremelia, Denethia, Lucious, Lashaine, Sheretha, Cernitha, Kwabena, Tiffonia, Lesma, Ketchia, Letrecia, Tabeeka, Cawanna, Lucrelia, and Jamesia  &mdash;  likewise suggest that sub-Saharan genetics are involved.</p>
<p>It was overwhelmingly Atlanta and other majority-black counties that showed testing irregularities.</p>
<p>Still, anyone who&rsquo;s sat in front of a TV for the past forty years knows that America&rsquo;s dumbest and most primitive humans, our brave nation&rsquo;s primary impediments to truly meaningful progress, are the drooling, banjo-plucking rural hillbillies.</p>
<p>Wait  &mdash;  wasn&rsquo;t Deliverance filmed in Georgia?</p>
<p>Yes, it was  &mdash;  way up in Rabun County.</p>
<p>For comparison&rsquo;s sake, I selected an elementary school at random from Rabun County and one from Atlanta that had been featured in the governor&rsquo;s report. The hilljack school is as overwhelmingly white as the Atlanta school is black. Their respective zip codes&rsquo; median household income is roughly the same, although the blacks earned a trifle more skrilla in 2009  &mdash;  the year before the governor sent in monitors to oversee the testing.</p>
<p>Fifth-graders in both schools scored almost identically in 2009&rsquo;s standardized tests. The only two major statistical differences were that the inner-city black kids received nearly $3,000 more yearly in educational funding than the rural Deliverance kids, and 51.4% of the black classrooms were flagged for high wrong-to-right testing irregularities, while the trailer-trash kiddies&rsquo; tests showed zero cheating. So in order to achieve testing parity with those toothless inbred hillbabies, Atlanta&rsquo;s black kids needed an extra $3,000 in funding and had to cheat their goddamned asses off.</p>
<p>Happy now?</p>

We do love the ebonics names that Afros give dey churrin.  Anything that blacks do that voluntarily emancipates them from Anglo civilization is a good thing.   The more Afro they can be in all aspects, the more they distinguish themselves from us.</p>
<p>We want them as distinct and as different as possible.  Anything that reverts them back to Afrodom makes it harder for our liberal elites to prove that Diversity is our strength.</p>

		<p>I am a former teacher and I think the problem is far larger than most people think.  </p>
<p>I actually think that most school districts in metro areas are cheating because the compete with each other for students.  Some of the private school scores are also way to high to believe.  They cheat too. </p>

<p>   &mdash;   This author has obviously not taught in an inner city school filled with blacks and latinos who are, ahem, not the brightest lights in the sky.  I HAVE and lament for the future of our nation.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  - All the black teachers named in this article had female-type names.  Does this mean that black women are untrustworthy in large numbers?  I hope not because it looks bad here.</p>

		<p>Well, Fartelle and LaTwatta and Obeesha have come home to roost!! (These ARE the names of my chickens&hellip;.they&rsquo;re dark brown&hellip;.)  As a former teacher, I understand how important it is to teachers and to administrators for their kids to perform well on the tests.  If they don&rsquo;t it can mean your job.  So in a way, all these so called educators were simply protecting their employment.  No Child Left Behind has created many more problems than it solved, and cheating is a biggie.  There&rsquo;s more incentive to cheat than not to cheat; especially if you&rsquo;re in an under-performing school.  But, since we know miracles don&rsquo;t happen in school testing, SOMEBODY should have taken a closer look long before they did&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I say shame on these so called teachers and principals. They KNOW these kids don&rsquo;t have a clue yet they pass them along anyway knowing they don&rsquo;t have what it takes to make the next grade. Apparently, they don&rsquo;t care that they are sending their own out into the world, well, pretty much stupid. Nothing will ever change until they admit they have a serious problem and work honestly to fix it.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a young black girl in my daughters 6th grade class some years back who kept asking her the time despite there being a clock on the wall. When my daughter pointed to the clock, she admitted not knowing how to tell time. I don&rsquo;t know which feeder school this young girl came from, but they did her no favors by continuing to pass her along. The same thing is happening to these students, and if their parents give 2 cents, they will demand better even if it means teaching them at even more basic levels. I won&rsquo;t hold my breath on those parents though.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;d you expect? You have a certain race of &#8220;administrators&#8221; and management that proclaims to &#8220;manage&#8221; others of a certain race. Those &#8220;admins&#8221; are fully aware that their own kind are completely incapable of meeting white standards; the result is cheating, lying and downright corruption for their fifteen minutes of fame as a &#8220;great administrator&#8221; or teacher. Mind you, these same AA appointees are making (notice I didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;earning&#8221;) more than most of you for their deeds.</p>
<p>None of this should be news to anyone. When whites excel, and they usually do, blacks do whatever they possibly can to somehow cheat their way to a similar level. Of course, even WITH the cheating, they still lose by a landslide. You can take them out of the jungle, but you can&rsquo;t take the jungle out of them;; they simply weren&rsquo;t born with the same capacity that you and I have.</p>
<p>Another thing is that these black managers lie to the point where it no longer fools much of anyone; guess low IQ will do that to you. Practically everyone, even the most liberal of liberals, knows that blacks can not possibly perform at the same level as whites. Unfortunately, they take solace in their weekly paycheck and are willing to sell their souls for as much.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  - With all due respect, and in principle I agree with you, but the problem is that we are teaching &#8216;white people&rsquo; knowledge to people of different cultures who see and construct the world differently than our kind.  (We are a &#8216;multicultural&rsquo; nation now, after all!)</p>
<p>Little Shaquanda and DeVaun do not have white, middle class values.  They have NO IDEA what it means to live like a white person, rich or poor.  They also haven&rsquo;t a care about white culture, and they look upon white people in the same way we might look upon someone from Nepal.  There&rsquo;s just no commonality there.</p>
<p>Their heroes are basketball stars, gangsta rappas, screechy, attitude-filled divas who &#8216;roll their heads, shoulders and eyes for everything.&rsquo;  Their &#8216;scholars&rsquo; are their race hustlers and race-obsessed activists like Malcolm X, Maya Angelou, Sharpton, MLK, etc.  </p>
<p>They have different priorities, likes and interests.  They have a kind of &#8216;black knowledge&rsquo; that neithr you nor I can decipher.  </p>
<p>Their rythmn and way of life is so different from ours.  They like action, emotion, drama and explosive physical force.  (Breakdancing, Hip Hop dancing, sports, gang fights, hoochie dancing, mob and rob - all symptoms of their cultural rythmn.)</p>
<p>When they are forced out of their ghettos and &#8216;hoods into big, cold buildings filled with desks, rules, books and barking adults &#8216;who don&rsquo;t look or talk like them,&rsquo; what do any of us expect?  We are trying to transform them into a version of &#8216;us&rsquo; in the same way that the Indian boarding schools of the last century tried to unmake the American Indian.  It just doesn&rsquo;t work.  Culture is that powerful.</p>
<p>So if Delanita and Raashawn can&rsquo;t master the material, it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s alien to them.  Unreal.  Not &#8216;relevant&rsquo; to life on the mean streets.  Then when &#8216;reformers&rsquo; who think we&rsquo;re all the same (just with different skin colors) come in and say, &#8220;You lousy teachers, we&rsquo;ll use tests to weed you out,&#8221; well then we will be less inclined to hold black and brown students to white standards, because it&rsquo;s a recipe for getting fired.  I have seen this many times.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it is.  I personally hold my own children to high standards, and if I find any students who are receptive I do everything I can to open the doors to my culture&rsquo;s knowledge.  But there is a huge segment of the black and brown population for whom all of this is gibberish.</p>
<p>Our hands are tied, and no &#8216;reform&rsquo; of the last 75 years has worked to close the achievement &#8216;gap.&rsquo;  Think on that for a moment.</p>

		<p>The larger scandal - as Pat Buchanan explains in his most recent column - is that the entire so-called &#8220;black middle class&#8221; consists of low achieving blacks who have soft, well-paying jobs in the public sector, which pays huge salaries and benefits relative to what they could possibly make in the private sector. </p>
<p>So-called black middle class was created through this gargantuan disguised welfare program, and this entailed growing federal and state governments to Frankenstein proportions in order to accommodate blacks.</p>
<p>But healthcare, education, and other private sectors are also involved.</p>
<p>So half of our blacks are working for the government, and the other half were left behind, they are the dangerous blacks who riot in the slums.</p>
<p>The decision to allow tens of millions of low IQ Hispanics in the US has made it impossible - even purely theoretically - to provide blacks with the simpler jobs suited to their talents at living wages.</p>
<p>Now that the federal government has to trillions in spending, the wheels are coming off this crazy jalopy, and one of the side effects will be that absolutely incredible levels of black violence, crime, and dysfunction in the US rise will markedly.</p>
<p>Even though blacks are bitterly disappointed with their black Messiah, things will be even worse when we have another white in the White House.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that blacks are simply not competitive (nor are &#8220;Hispanics&#8221;, meaning, basically Indian/mestizos from Mexico) in any modern society.</p>
<p>The brilliant plan of keeping the worst blacks in jail, the next to worst on welfare or menial jobs, and the passable blacks in fake government jobs only worked as long as we could waste trillions of dollars. </p>
<p>Turns out all that money was borrowed from the Chinese.</p>
<p>Whoops!!!</p>

		<p>Yesterday, I happened to see a link to an article that appeared here:   </p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/KD2qf" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/KD2qf</a></p>
<p>The writer of the article was Peter Hitchens, and it was one of the typical kind of liberal denial and avoidance essays whereby Hitchens was bemoaning the catastrophic degree of decline that has visited itself upon the late, formerly great city of Detroit, Michigan.  Hitchens, in the typical liberal devious fashion, was blaming everything under the sun for why Detroit has been transformed into a crime-infested sewer - but never was the subject of RACE cited as the primarily reason for the ruination of Detroit.    I offered a comment that provided the delusional readers of this liberal rag with the demographic statistical breakdown for the city of Detroit:</p>
<p>* Black alone - 689,965 (75.7%)<br>
    * White alone - 120,891 (13.3%)<br>
    * Hispanic - 67,361 (7.4%)<br>
    * Asian alone - 15,184 (1.7%)<br>
    * Two or more races - 13,548 (1.5%)<br>
    * American alone - 1,831 (0.2%)<br>
    * Other race alone - 2,068 (0.2%)</p>
<p>And, firmly posited the question to Hitchens that it was past time for White European people to come to grips with the realities of race - and stated that European nations cannot maintain or preserve their First World nation status when they allow millions of third world caliber losers to flood into their nations and dispossess their native White European populations.</p>
<p>Checked back this morning - my comment was not approved for posting.     Big surprise.    </p>
<p>This Atlanta test cheating, test result rigging scandal is - as other posters have stated - just the tip of the iceberg.   These anti-White, hate-filled, Cultural Marxists who are behind this insane and obviously delusional ideology of &#8216;egalitarianism&rsquo; - these subversives are not stupid, and I believe that they know the score on racial differences between whites and many of the non-white groups.  So, why do they still continue to push this insanity?</p>
<p>Answer: It has to do with hate.   Hatred of White, Western, European people and of White Western Civilization.  The destruction of the White European race and the eradication of White Western Civilization is all that matters to these Cultural Marxists.  </p>
<p>On Western Voices World News recently, there appeared a story titled:  &#8220;Fourteen Year Old Gang-Raped by Africans in Norway&#8221;.   This is happening all over Europe, as well as all over America, friends.   Blacks are gang raping, and often killing white females - some of them race mixing, trashy white women, and some of them who were not race mixers and just innocent victims of these  black or mestizo gang rape predators.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m here to tell you that our sick, mentally twisted Cultural Marxist enemies get a huge thrill out of reading about these acts of  violence being directed at our white race.    This is a critical component of their program to literally genocide our race.    The crime statistics that relate to the commission of violent crimes by specific racial groups are well known and well documented by our ruling elites - and therefore, when we see our so-called &#8216;leaders&rsquo; creating refugee or asylum programs that result in the deliberate importation of unskilled, uneducated, uncivilized people from Africa - and then these ruling elites use those nosy questions about race on the census forms to find out which areas of America whites are fleeing to - and then THAT is where our ruling elites decide to deposit these Africans   &mdash;   what sort of white moron cannot manage to connect the dots on this and reach the conclusion that our elites WANT to unleash these violent prone blacks on formerly safe white communities in hopes that these &#8216;refugees&rsquo; will rape, rob, terrorize and likely kill white people?  </p>

<p>I am a Southerner, and I moved from a big Southern city to a rural Southern area that was 98% white five years ago.  In the last couple of years, I have seen Hispanics move in, and more recently, I have seen mulatto children with their white parents and grandparents, as well as some black adults.  Very sad to see this area become diverse.</p>
<p>If you must stay in America, at least stay in the big city.  Some people in small towns will accept you, and I don&rsquo;t blame you for wanting a safe place to raise your children, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want my children to marry your children, and I don&rsquo;t want any additional foreigners moving to my area.  Even if your children are bright and hard-working, nobody here would want to see them take honors and scholarship money away from local children.  There are lots of areas of India that are 100% Indian.  Why can&rsquo;t there be parts of the world that are 100% white?  Why can&rsquo;t we have a little corner of the world without diversity?</p>

<p>Please don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I hear what you are saying and know that it&rsquo;s true. When I say shame on those teachers, and that they need to admit they have a serious problem and need to work honestly to fix it, much of what you are saying is what they need to be honest about. I just don&rsquo;t think these kids can be taught the same way whites are taught, and it&rsquo;s been proven over and over again. Believe me, I really feel for the teacher that has a class full of minorities: After all, there is only so much they can do.</p>

		<p>More about this &#8216;Atlanta Public School cheating scandal&rsquo; (as it has been coined by the local media) later, right now I have a message for #2 Sureesh:</p>
<p>I live out in the country, in rural Georgia. Just last week our local old community store/gas station that has been family owned for over 40 years and was a landmark and gathering place for the locals was bought by an Indian family. As soon as word got out, the parking lot, which was always full of coming and going community members, was virtually vacant and has been since.</p>
<p>Indians, boosted by their obscene tax breaks, incentives and low interest rates offered only to THEM as foreigners - not the Americans who have lived, worked and paid taxes here all their lives - offered the owner a ridiculous price no American could, and took over one more [formerly] unique American insitution. The new Indian owners immediately fired every one of the workers, who were long time employees, loved and treated well by their bosses, who were also their friends, and replaced them with family members.</p>
<p>THAT is why we don&rsquo;t like you. Not because you&rsquo;re stupid, but because you feel no shame in shaking down an entire country for your gain. You have an automatic advantage over America&rsquo;s own people the instant you set foot in this country, and I, for one, resent the daylights out of you and yours.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cooking the books&#8221; has a deadlier dimension that merely <br>
erasing and changing answers on test answer sheets.  In a mode<br>
of &#8220;school reform&#8221; that explicitly contrasted its urban successes with &#8220;Jensenism&#8221;, a bright and brainy building posited that Jensen&rsquo;s findings were true and then set about to search into the cracks and crevices to see how the diminished Black/White performance gap may have been attained.  Among the<br>
predicted findings: group &#8220;learning&#8221; and &#8220;responding&#8221; by way of which mixed ability small group instuction was  supposed to perform to the advantage of each student at the table, in fact functioned in a Robin Hood way to put ceilings on the motivation, performance of abler students at the marginal benefit of slower students; special education students (in most<br>
categories disproportionately minority ) were evaluated separately from others and results disaggregated.  Etc. Etc.<br>
What one would have hypothesized to have existed off stage in the fashion of hidden &#8220;gears and pulleys&#8221; did in fact exist.  The simple &#8220;boys will be boys&#8221; fraud of altering answer sheets is just barnyard fun compared to the larger fraud of desecrating the whole system.     </p>

		<p>This appears to be a result of a very successful affirmative action program.  I remember about 25 - 30 years ago when the great hue and cry was that children in the inner city needed teachers that looked like them&hellip;to serve as&#8221;role models&#8221;.  So the state colleges turn out all these illiterates with teaching credentials, and the cities snatch them up&hellip;flssh forward a number of years&hellip;the inmates by now have taken over the asylum&hellip;they run it all&hellip;and this is what we get for our good intentions and tax dollars&hellip;</p>
<p>Plus, folks like to say that it&rsquo;s the children who suffer, but that&rsquo;s probably not the half of it&hellip;why would the teachers bother to even try to teach them anything when they know they&rsquo;re just going to fake the results at the end?</p>
<p>Plus also, I would bet anyone out there all the money in my pocket that everyone of these children would exhibit more self-esteem than a van full of Little Miss Sunshines.</p>
<p>Good God&hellip;We are doomed.</p>
