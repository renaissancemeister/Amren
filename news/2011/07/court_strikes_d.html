<h1>Court Strikes Down Michigan Ban on Race in College Admissions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Chambers and Oralandar Brand-Williams, The Detroit News, July 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Michigan&rsquo;s ban on using race and gender as a factor in admission to public colleges and universities was overturned today by a federal appeals court, which said the voter-approved measure harms minorities and is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The 2-1 decision struck down Proposal 2, the 2006 law that had forced the University of Michigan and other state schools to revise their admission policies. The judges ruled that the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Proposal 2 reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests,&#8221; judges R. Guy Cole Jr. and Martha Craig Daughtrey said.</p>
<p>The ban, passed with 58 percent of the vote nearly five years ago, affected government hiring as well as college admissions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>George Washington, the chief attorney for the law&rsquo;s opponents, applauded the decision today.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a great victory. It means affirmative action is legal again in college admissions. It means that thousands of talented black, Latino and Native Americans can go to our public universities,&#8221; Washington said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, the ruling could be appealed, Washington said, to the U.S. Supreme Court or the entire panel of the 6th Circuit Appeals Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ward Connerly, a former University of California regent who was a major backer of Proposal 2 and California&rsquo;s similar Proposition 209, said the ruling means the people have no right to govern their own institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s saying the people have no right to insist that everyone be treated equality. It places the ultimate decision in the hands of the university  &mdash;  that they are supreme ones,&#8221; Connerly said by phone from California. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a terrible, terrible decision that will not stand.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Opponents of Proposal 2 blamed the measure for declines in the percentage of minorities in U-M&rsquo;s freshman classes in the years immediately after the ruling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The activist group By Any Means Necessary, which pursued the lawsuit to overturn Proposal 2, scheduled news conferences at 2 p.m. at the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor and 4 p.m. at 645 Griswold in Detroit to discuss the ruling. The Detroit Branch of the NAACP also scheduled a news conference at 3:30 p.m. to address the decision.</p>

		<p>If the 14th Amendment clause provides for equal protection, then if you give preference to a group then a member of another group loses. The interpretation misses the point of equal protection to compete, it is not equal outcomes regardless of your ability to compete.  <br>
Of course this would be thrown into chaos of Asia kids were deemed minority, as they would displace most other minorities in all intellectual tests short of basketball.  And if it is truly minorities, then do whites qualify when they are in the minority?  I thought not.  </p>

		<p>I think the state of Michigan should take a very different approach to this.  One of state sovereignty.  The court is overstepping its bounds, and quite severely.  If even one state on even one major issue like this, simply says one of two things, they could stop this nonsense permanently.</p>
<p>Either, they should correctly point out that no, neither the 14th amendment nor any Constitution says any such thing (quite the opposite in fact) and they should correctly identify the court as making illegal decisions&hellip;and ignore them.  This would put in place the VERY reasonable benchmark that a judge would have to successfully offer a legal argument to back up his ruling or it would be ignored&hellip;.preferably followed by that judge&rsquo;s dismissal for malfeasance.  In other words, if only a reasonable person reading the Constitution would come to the same conclusion as the judge, then a ruling of that type would take effect.  But if not, states would simply ignore it.</p>
<p>Or, they should simply point out that NOTHING gives ANY court, even the Supreme Court and authority whatsoever to decide such things.  Who told the courts they were allowed to measure laws by any yardstick, let alone a constitutional one.  Nobody.  They simply started acting as if they had that power one day.  They do not.  And they have no enforcement mechanism.</p>

<p>OK, I will be the first one to ask the obvious question: </p>
<p>If they are so talented why can&rsquo;t they get in without affirmative action?</p>
<p>Could anyone tell me if Mr. Washington was asked this question, and if so, what his answer was?</p>

		<p>Wow. Do you all read they hypocritical comments?</p>
<p>So, if I DO NOT use race as a criteria, I am racist. If I DO use race, it is equality? Hmmmmm.</p>
<p>I love the comment: &#8220;It means that thousands of talented black, Latino and Native Americans can go to our public universities,&rdquo; Washington said. Uh, what was keeping them out? Since when does ANY University keep out &#8220;talented&#8221; blacks? </p>
<p>Affirmative Action is used since they are NOT talented. They can&rsquo;t pass the tests. They don&rsquo;t have the ability THUS, they are let in due to the color of their skin ( an admission blacks are less intelligent than whites.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The judges ruled that the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment&#8221;  Equal protection means EQUAL treatment. So, if I consider the skin color of my next employee, that is ok? Good. I will only hire whites people since I don&rsquo;t want to violate the equal protection clause. </p>
<p>My head hurts.</p>

		<p>How does this law place special burdens on minorties?  The Court has it backwards as to the equal protection clause.  That clause says people will be treated equally, not some getting special consideration.</p>

<p>Photo and bio of Judge R. Guy Cole Jr.:</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Cole believes that his personal experiences of living in Birmingham through the most turbulent periods of the civil rights struggle prepared him for his current position as Circuit Judge. His interest in the justice system and equal rights were nurtured by those experiences, and he also developed a respect for the importance of a just and fair legal system.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/Loc8W" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/Loc8W</a></p>
<p>From bio of Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey:</p>
<p>&#8220;She is especially proud of the accomplishments of their daughter, Carran <br>
(&#8216;Carrie&rsquo;), who is an assistant United States attorney in Nashville.  In addition, Carrie,  who found herself still single at 35, recently chose to adopt an 11-month-old girl from an orphanage in China.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t wait until we see some real &#8220;harm done minorities.&#8221; With each ruling like this, they teach us the law means nothing, poltiics means nothing, voting means nothing. Eventually we will learn enough not to waste our time on these diversions. Then the real &#8220;racism&#8221; will begin&hellip;.only it will well justified by a half century of teaching us that peaceful means will only be overturned and ignored. They did it to themsevles. We tried to play by the rules and they just changed the rules whenever we got even the smallest victory.</p>

		<p>*The judges ruled that the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>Now let me get this straight - these &#8220;judges&#8221; think that a law BANNING the use of race and gender VIOLATES the equal protection clause! How does that make sense? Its really frightening to think that these mentally deranged idiots make decisions that affect millions of people.</p>
<p>*It means that thousands of talented black, Latino and Native Americans can go to our public universities,&rdquo; Washington said.</p>
<p>Well if they&rsquo;re so &#8220;talented&#8221; they shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem getting in NOW. Once they&rsquo;re in it will take THOUSANDS of hours of extra tutoring to bring these &#8220;talents&#8221; out, if ever!</p>
<p>*The ban, passed with 58 percent of the vote nearly five years ago,-</p>
<p>If we live in a democracy, how is it that acouple judges can invalidate\overule the votes of the majority of voters? This is done all the time and is one of THE main reasons we&rsquo;re in the fix we&rsquo;re in now. I remember years ago the voters of California voted to cut the benefits of illegals ( which might have saved them ) only to be overturned by a judge, and look at that state now. I&rsquo;ve never understood how that could be legal.  </p>

<p>===</p>
<p>No. It is not &#8220;Michigan&rsquo;s ban on using race and gender as a factor in admission to public colleges and universities&#8221; that places special burdens on minority interests.&#8221;  It is &#8220;the combination of well-documented racial differences in cognitive ability,&#8221; to quote Amy L. Wax of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, that imposes &#8220;burdens on minority interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wax continues: &#8220;&hellip;the consistent link between ability and job performance [substitute academic performance] generates a pattern that experts term &#8216;the validity-diversity tradeoff&rsquo;: job [admissions] selection devices that best predict future job [academic] performance generate the smallest number of minority hires in a broad range of positions &hellip; </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.pronounced differences in the background distribution of skill and human capital, not arbitrary hurdles imposed by employers [admissions criteria], are the principle factor behind racial imbalances in most jobs [admissions]. Moreover, blacks lag behind whites in actual on-the-job [in-the-classroom] performance, which indicates that employers [universities] are not unfairly excluding minorities from the workforce but rather BENDING OVER BACKWARDS TO INCLUDE THEM [my all-caps].&#8221; </p>

 <br>
If those blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans are so talented, why do they need affirmative action? <br>
 <br>
Liberals should be embarrassed to promote affirmative action policies because they draw attention of the fact that racial differences in average intelligence are significant and persistent. <br>
 <br>
Affirmative action policies do not create opportunities. They take them from those who deserve them and give them to those who do not. <br>
     <br>
Affirmative action policies reinforce prejudice because they advance members of politically favored minorities to positions where they are not able to perform adequately. </p>

<p>Well, at least Judge Cole (and possibly Judge Daughtrey) isn&rsquo;t being a hypocrite.  He got his law school admission and appointment to the bench because of his skin color, who is he to deny the privilege to someone else?              </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t think for a second a school like Michigan isn&rsquo;t still practicing some form of Affirmative Action.  Otherwise the following wouldn&rsquo;t be possible: <i>However, last fall, U-M reported its minority freshman enrollment had rebounded to 10.6 percent.</i></p>
<p>UM is subject to intense competition for spots from top-students all over the country and overseas.  Black enrollment would fail to break 1% under true race-neutral policies.  I recall reading about the rebound in minority-enrollment at the University of Florida a few years after the state (purportedly) ended Affirmative Action there.  One administrator was quoted as attributing the rise to &#8220;creative-recruitment.&#8221;  And Jeb Bush didn&rsquo;t pass up an opportunity to take credit for his idea working (by circumventing the original concept)  You better believe that Michigan&rsquo;s admission committee is working frenetically to push as many minority students through the back-door as possible.  What this ruling does is it makes it even easier for UM admit under-qualified minorities and far more difficult for shafted White and Asian students to sue. <br>

		<p>I pray this one gets appealed to the Supreme Court.  We NEED to go back to admissions on the basis of merit or ability, period end of report.  This level playing field garbage has destroyed education in America.  The races for the most part are NOT equal, and continuing to pretend that this emperor isn&rsquo;t butt-nekkid is destroying our country.</p>

<p>This &#8216;argument&rsquo;, that lack of intelligence burdens minorities, falls right into the hands of the left? It&rsquo;s an acknowledgement that groups have rights, and that the case is not about individual rights, or individuals who&rsquo;s rights have been infringed upon, and that groups of people have at least some special rights. Basically, it&rsquo;s dividing people into two classes of people. </p>
<p>You can guarantee, this same law school, and the same state of Michigan will teach students whites all have &#8216;white privilege&rsquo;. But it seems to me, whites have the privilege of being insulted and disparaged. All of them. </p>
<p>Since groups all have special rights, what special rights will this law school and these jurists, and the state of Michigan, bestow upon whites? I&rsquo;d be quite curious to know their nature. </p>

		<p>There is a very easy cost efficient way of solving this problem that makes everybody happy. Invite all the black/latino applicants for a particular degree program to a lecture explaining what the degree is all about. At the end of the lecture ask if everybody understood. Most will say so, the rest will soon learn. Give everybody who says they understand the degree in question. They&rsquo;ll have their precious degree, the state has saved a fortune in tuition fees and the real students can get on with learning.</p>

		<p>#16 Michigan Resident&rsquo;s was the only comment that looked back even briefly.</p>
<p>In 1954 and for many years after, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka Kansas was hailed by liberals and the main stream media as perhaps the greatest supreme court decision in American history.  That was the decision that overthrew racial discrimination and segregation in America. </p>
<p>Separate but equal was out.  Separate schools, separate anything based on race, were inherently unequal.  There were to be no more black schools and white schools.  Just schools. </p>
<p>Martin Luther King echoed that idea when he spoke of judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the point: the enemies of the white race speak out of both sides of their mouth. Heads they win;tails we lose.  Good intentions and lofty ideals are being used to displace and destroy white people. </p>
<p>Just look at the record.</p>

		<p>It is quite rare when you get so many excellent posts on any subject.  All of the above posters hit it over the wall.  This high-handed opinion can find absolutely no support in the Constitution. This all started in the Michigan Law school case of Grutter v. Bollinger when the Supremes upheld the affirmative action admissions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. The 5-4 decision was announced on June 23, 2003.<br>
Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor wrote the majority and basically said that &#8220;diversity&#8221; was so important that it trumped the Equal Amendment Clause of the 14th Amendment.  O&rsquo;Connor basically wrote that we would only have to violate that clause for 25 years or so.  <br>
Also, as stated above, where does the court get off ignoring the vote of the people? Another classic opinion in that regard is when one gay federal judge overruled the overwhelming vote of the people of California who voted to ban gay marriage.<br>
Just think about it, the courts have declared that abortion is a Constitutional right and have banned any mention or image of God in a public place. </p>

		<p>Interesting how &#8220;thousands of talented blacks and Latinos&#8221; can&rsquo;t get into public colleges.  Yup, no doubt of it, the admissions committees consist of K members, neo-Nazis, and ignorant and bigoted rednecks who try to limit admissions to WASPs only.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It means that thousands of talented black, Latino and Native Americans can go to our public universities,&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>If they are talented, why do they need affirmative action? Why can&rsquo;t they gain admission on their own merit? Is something keeping them out, like the schools practicing racial discrimination?</p>

		<p>Fine.  Let the minorities have ALL the spots in colleges.  Most degrees nowadays are useless wastes of money, except perhaps in engineering and medicine.  Once these &#8220;talented students&#8221; have been given their unearned diplomas, they will find employment only in government.  However, thank God, the system which pays these wastes of space is now collapsing under its own weight.</p>

		<p>The new uderclass is now &#8220;boys.&#8221; This bodes well for men.  Statistics are showing fewer and fewer young boys, white and black, are enrolled in college .. and fewer are finishing. With the overemphasis on women in other areas, all boys have suffered&hellip;.. They are over represented in &#8220;special education,&#8221; remediation, Ritalin use&hellip;..underrepresented in colleges, honor societies, graduate studies, class office&hellip;.. the fems have seemed to emasculated the all boys while young black boys have been chemically castrated with &#8220;learning drugs&#8221; by the do gooder liberal educational elite.</p>

		<p>If Africans and Latinos are so talented they wouldn&rsquo;t need any affirmative action to help them get into schools. Their test scores would be enough.</p>
<p>Aiding specific groups with target outcomes for representation isn&rsquo;t racist? Then I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>

		<p>If this does go to the Surpreme Court, I&rsquo;m not sure the right decision will be made.  The 14th Amendment was written AGAINST white people and for black people.  Anyone who thinks that amendment covers whites is mistaken.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Did anyone think that a black judge and a white woman homosexual judge would vote differently?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to this, treating people the same violates an &#8216;equal protection&rsquo; law that requires everyone to be treated the same. It&rsquo;s like being in college again.</p>

		<p>What this indicates   &mdash;   among other things   &mdash;   is that the Civil Rights Movement was not about equality, but rather using the law to displace white people. It really came down to a battle for who will dominate the institutions. </p>
<p>Another thing to consider: we have had some 50 years of liberal civil rights laws, yet they still claim that certain minorities can not compete equally. Does this mean that liberalism has been a failure? </p>

		<p>Remember always that the left wing, regardless if they wear a robe or not will always side with left wing issues. The law, constitution, or just plain fairness has nothing to do with it. The &#8220;ends justify the means&#8221; always. We shouldn&rsquo;t be naive to think otherwise. </p>
<p>People, vote with your feet - go to an Asian doctor, a White dentist and deal with qualified people in business who you know didn&rsquo;t get special treatment. That&rsquo;s the only way to water down their phoney diplomas that they &#8220;don&rsquo;t&#8221; work so hard for. It&rsquo;s only fair. </p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t they just amend the constitution, instead of continuing to lie about it? The constitution has certainly been amended before. In fact, this is an argument about a constitutional amendment.</p>

		<p>The court decision is an open admission that minorities are inferior in intelligence and without affirmative action they cannot compete with whites.  How long whites will put up with being shafted as official policy is the question.  Qualified whites are being passed over to admit or hire inferior people on the basis of race.  When will whites stop being ducks and fight this open discrimination</p>

		<p>I never realized how sensitive blacks were until recently.<br>
They must be Super Sensitive if something that took place hundreds of years ago still causes them such mental anguish?</p>
<p>Yet they do not seem one bit ashamed of the fact that they have been offered Special Hep since 1961 and they still for the most part can&rsquo;t seem to make it on their own.<br>
I am wondering if it really is racism as they love to say causing this or if there is any possibility they just lack the mental ammunition to be successful Without Special Hep?</p>
<p>If FIFTY YEARS of Affirmative Action hasn&rsquo;t made them self sufficient how will adding another Fifty do anymore?</p>

		<p>the decision by the court is an open admission that minorities are inferior mentally and cannot compete with whites openly.  It is also obvious that the white folk are allowing themselves to be ripped off by the courts in open discrimination,  Yet white folk do nothing.</p>

		<p>The ruling is brazenly Orwellian. The 14th amendment prohibits discrimination. And now these clowns are saying that you violate the 14th amendment if you don&rsquo;t discriminate.</p>
<p>It is said that it is easier to remember the truth than to have to build an elaborate superstructure of more and more complex lies. Likewise, the left has to manufacture an artificial reality to maintain the edifice of lies. So if unqualified people get preferences to enter college the left must then also coerce employment through quotas and preferences to hire incompetents. Manufactured reality from cradle to grave.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Opponents of Proposal 2 blamed the measure for declines in the percentage of minorities in U-M&rsquo;s freshman classes in the years immediately after the ruling.&#8221;</p>
<p>So in other words you just admitted that they can not compete on an equal playing field and are therefor inferior.</p>
