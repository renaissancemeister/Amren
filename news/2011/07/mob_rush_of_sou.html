<h1>Mob Rush of South Oak Cliff Store Caught on Camera</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jason Whitely, WFAA (Dallas), July 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The upkeep and cleanliness of Sam Farah&rsquo;s convenience store could rival any in North Dallas.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t think this store is in Oak Cliff,&#8221; Farah said proudly of his investment.</p>
<p>But, crime is crippling his investment in the 3000 block of East Illinois Ave.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said it costs him about $3,000 a month.</p>
<p>{snip} Last week, a mob of people descended on his store all at once after midnight .</p>
<p>&#8220;They start trashing the store [and] eating,&#8221; Farah said while watching surveillance video of the incident. &#8220;It&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re robbing the store.&#8221;</p>
<p>While several paid, the rest ate, drink and stole before police could get there, Farah said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Farah estimated he lost up to $500 that night.</p>
<p>Shoplifting is common. {snip}</p>
<p>Customers have also attacked employees, according to video reviewed by News 8.</p>
<p>Plus, cashiers are seeing more counterfeit money. Someone passed a $100 bill recently that had a watermark of Abraham Lincoln, meaning it&rsquo;s really a $5 bill.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dallas police said officers have responded to 26 calls for help from his store this year, most coming within the last month for crimes like shoplifting, disorderly conduct and even aggravated assault.</p>
<p>DPD has made seven arrests. But, Farah wants zero tolerance and even posted a &#8220;Wall of Shame&#8221; outside his store that shows crooks his cameras caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked hard,&#8221; Farah explained. &#8220;I worked very hard to cut down on these crimes. I want somebody else to work with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Sunday, another store owner was murdered across the street from Farah&rsquo;s property. Police arrested one suspect and are still looking for two others.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This an extremely effective way for blacks to rob stores - get instant gratification. they are too quick for police - even if one officer was there, he wouldn&rsquo;t /couldn&rsquo;t use lethal force. Security would be overwhelmed. </p>
<p>We all know the left welcomes further disintegration and chaos because they will call for more government control.</p>
<p><br>
The only thing that will stop this the right to bear arms and use lethal force- and the left will fight tooth and nail to prevent that. </p>
<p>two other points that other posters have made but bear repeating.</p>
<p>a. a laptop for every child- remember that&rsquo;s what was holding blacks back - we now see what they do with internet access.<br>
b. i can&rsquo;t help but think that they feel emboldened by Obama and Eric Holder in particular - even if they don&rsquo;t know who he is -his &#8216;attitude&rsquo; has probably trickled down to law enforcement - the message - arrest too many blacks and YOU, law officer, will be prosecuted. </p>

		<p>This video, like so many others is a perfect example of the &#8216;800 lb. gorilla&rsquo; in the room.  Anytime we see this sort of thing in a video on Youtube or elsewhere, the one common denominator is the fact that the perpetrators are almost always Black.  The news anchors don&rsquo;t mention race however.  One would have to be quite conditioned though, not to have this register in some area of their brain.  Once it does, it&rsquo;s quite difficult to separate the racial aspects.  The bottom line is - Blacks commit a majority of the street crime, and it&rsquo;s not due to &#8220;social conditions&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s due to race.</p>

What a miserable life, trying to run a business near &#8220;apartments&#8221; with lots of suspects.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t have open counters. Put the merchandise BEHIND shatter proof plastic &#8220;windows&#8221; where only he can get the merchandise. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t them then in. He could have a &#8220;foyer&#8221; in the front where only one or two people at a time can get in. The outer door locks and then he unlocks the inner door. By doing this he can let in only 2 at a time.</p>
<p>This guy seems surprised. How many times does he  have to realize HE is in the wrong place. Maybe his racists attitude is causing these youths to steal? He needs to look at himself and his part in the legacy of slavery. Maybe the store owner is racist and the blacks have to steal stuff since he won&rsquo;t sell it to them.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but think there is a little poetic justice here.  I bet the path between a native born white American owning this gas station and someone named &#8220;Farah&#8221; owning it involved some sort of the usual Patel-style scam of bilking the SBA for bigger and bigger loans as various family members buy and sell the station to each other.</p>
<p><i>But, Farah wants zero tolerance and even posted a &ldquo;Wall of Shame&rdquo; outside his store that shows crooks his cameras caught.</i></p>
<p>The cameras were there, and the mob knew it, but that didn&rsquo;t shame them.  Why should a wall of pictures be expected to work any better?  Besides you saw in the video that several housing projects surround this station, and putting these &#8220;yoots&#8221; and their faces on a &#8220;wall of shame&#8221; will engender a vicious negative reaction from &#8220;the community.&#8221;  Quannell X might even ride up from Houston to lead a protest.</p>
<p>I have noticed that more and more you&rsquo;re seeing these automated gas stations, e.g. Fuelman, where there are no convenience stores and you have to use a credit or debit card or the company credit card to buy gas.  I predict you&rsquo;re going to see more and more of these things as these sort of black mobs get more and more brazen.</p>

		<p>How sad. Going by the name, Mr. Farah is probably a member of the Arab Christian community. Many if not most of these people came here looking for freedom and the opportunity to succeed. But I really wonder whether it&rsquo;s even worth trying to in a neighborhood like this.</p>
<p>If Mr. Farah&rsquo;s smart, he&rsquo;ll move his business to an affluent white neighborhood and leave these &#8220;youths&#8221; to figure out why they have to drive miles to buy food.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how about a security shotgun and doors that shut and lock at the press of a button?</p>

<p>Agree. Whites are not allowed to criticize blacks or to suggest policies addressing the wave of crime engulfing the black community-such policy prescriptions are the sole prerogative of black community &#8220;leaders&#8221;. Unfortunately, these &#8220;leaders&#8221; seem only interested in extorting money from white people. It is necessary to hold them accountable for the actions of people who they claim the exclusive right to represent and counsel.</p>

<p>Not FN likely since Christian Arabs are not allowed in America. They are required to stay in their respective muslim countries until they can be murdered by muslims. BET he is a muslims so no compassion here. If I am right, he should gun down the blacks and he would get away with it being a muslim.</p>

		<p>When businesses close in South Central (Los Angeles) the Leftists scream &#8220;racism&#8221; when it is only self preservation - business close because they cannot afford to keep losing their goods and their lives to &#8220;youths&#8221;. Also major big-box stores would not even think about moving into a high-crime neighborhood. How about blacks policing their own &#8220;community&#8221; and stop blaming Whitey? Too difficult, I guess&hellip;</p>

		<p>You know the stereotype of the Indian immigrant owing a 7-11 (think of Apu on the Simpsons)? They usually bring in family to help them run the store so they don&rsquo;t have to pay wages staff outside the household so hiring a security guard is not an option. (yes, criticize us for NOT giving whites jobs if you want.)</p>
<p>EVERY single Indian convenience store owner/worker that I know HAS been robbed by Blacks! I do know of an 18 year old kid (son of parents who owned the 7-11) who shot the three black thugs causing injury. He was NOT charged as the police accepted the fact that he was shooting them in self defense.</p>
<p>An honest question is, if the 18 year old had been white, would he have been charged with a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; for shooting the black thugs? Honestly let me know. </p>

		<p>What does this race traitor expect?  He invested his wealth in providing services to blacks.  And now they are doing what they always do&hellip;..victimizing those who take care of them.</p>
<p>He should shut his store down and find a nice white community to serve.</p>
<p>This is something most people, even racially aware people, don&rsquo;t get.  From the farmers in south africa to the 7-11 clerks in the ghetto, making money is only an intended effect of the main reason these institutions were built&hellip;..to serve black people.  Black people are evil and it is wrong to serve them.   It&rsquo;s wrong to grow food for them.  It&rsquo;s wrong to clothe them.  To house them.  And it&rsquo;s extremely wicked to arm them.</p>
<p>These are not just moral judgements&hellip;.they are&hellip;.laws of nature with predictable, even immutable consequences.  There are no exceptions.  Not anyplace on earth today.  Not at any time in history.  </p>
<p>How serious is this?  It skirts the line between enabling (well meaning but dysfunctional and self-destructive) and aiding and abetting (knowingly empowering them to harm others).  The consequences are grim&hellip;.but those suffering them are not victims.  They are victimizers.  They know something bad will result but just don&rsquo;t want that bad to happen to them.  The worst don&rsquo;t even care if bad stuff happens to them and will operate at a loss, to keep serving their beloved blacks.  Most of the holdouts in south africa are of this mind.  They hang on because they don&rsquo;t want their beloved blacks to become unemployed.  Meanwhile, those exact same people, plot their horrible deaths.  It is tough to feel sorry for them once you examine their motives and look closely at their behavior.</p>
<p>The guy running this store knows that blacks harm people.  And he knows the existence of his store is part of the reason that community of blacks can exist where it is.  He does not care that they then go on to rape, rob and murder his fellow whites and ethnically cleanse them from the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>He only cares that they are victimizing him now.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Swarming&#8221; incidents like this are the new wave of crime among blacks, even if caught, their individual acts are so minor they will get off while the mob they come in with gets away with thousands of dollars of merchandise.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually an amazing example of thinking on their part.</p>

		<p>This guy should install a couple of cages containing rattlesnakes.  If groups of blacks come in and begin misbehaving he could threaten to turn them loose - there&rsquo;s nothing American blacks are more terrified of than snakes, and they rarely can make the distinction between those which are venomous and non-venomous. Even a couple of harmless blacksnakes would do.</p>

<p>What a ridiculous set of statements!  Racist attitudes whenever or wherever are not a justification for crimes.  These types are happening everywhere and 2011 is too late to be claiming the same old excuses.  This guy is from the Middle East, so his family was not here in the days of slavery.  Nor are any whites alive today.  It is past and well over compensated for, so get over it.  There is nothing to blame but the propensity of blacks to act like what they are genetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;An honest question is, if the 18 year old had been white, would he have been charged with a &lsquo;hate crime&rsquo; for shooting the black thugs? Honestly let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Probably. He may have a chance if there were cameras, but if not, don&rsquo;t count on it.</p>
<p>In an age where killing, raping, and beating someone, due to racism is justifiable, we are in very bad position.</p>

		<p>@12 - no, he&rsquo;s got an accent; not American-reared. Not that there&rsquo;s any point to my saying so other than pedantry. </p>

		<p>Post #26-Great reply to #6 (Black Hat), whose post makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>How is this man racist?  He opened the store in a decidedly black area, perhaps thinking the region was under-served.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of seeing foreign owned businesses, but it&rsquo;s hard not to give credit to someone who works 6 or even 7 days trying to make a success of his enterprise.  These mobs have increased in the last 2 years or so, partly because their strategy is successful.  A few may be caught but the majority will get away with the goods and the crime.  And law enforcement comes too late to successfully deal with the situation appropriately.  Some new strategies must be developed to deal with this ever increasing type of crime.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I can&rsquo;t help but think there is a little poetic justice here. I bet the path between a native born white American owning this gas station and someone named &ldquo;Farah&rdquo; owning it involved some sort of the usual Patel-style scam of bilking the SBA for bigger and bigger loans as various family members buy and sell the station to each other.</p>
<p>But, Farah wants zero tolerance and even posted a &ldquo;Wall of Shame&rdquo; outside his store that shows crooks his cameras caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>A &#8221; Wall of Shame&#8221; is simply a futile gesture. These prims have NO shame. One needs to have a conscience in order to be ashamed. They have no souls.</p>
