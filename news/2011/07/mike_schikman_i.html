		<p>Jared Taylor really needs to be on radio and television more often.  Especially television.  I especially like it when he goes up against people who don&rsquo;t agree with him, like that black lawyer on BET who you could tell was about to implode due to what Jared was saying(see link below).<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s also down right hilarious how mad his opponents get.</p>

		<p>Given what Jared Taylor was saying about the educational expectations for the races, this might fit in nicely:</p>
<p>Spelling Bee Champ</p>
<p>My name be Eboneesha Hernandez, a African-Hispanic-American Girl who jus got a award for bein the bess speler in class.  I gots a 67% on the spelin text and 30 points for being black, 5 points for not bringin drugs to class, 5 points for not bringin guns to class, and 5 points for not gettin pregnut during the cemester.<br>
 <br>
It be hard to beat a score of 120%.  White dude who sit nex to me is McGee from Jaxon Mizipy.  He got a 94% on the text but no extra points on acount of he have the same skin color as the opressirs of 150 years ago.  Granny ax me to thank all Dimocrafts and Liberuls for suportin afermative axion.  You be showin da way to true eqwallity.<br>
 <br>
I be gittin in medical skool nex an mabe I be yo doctor when Barrac take over da healfcare in dis contry.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Jared said nothing about the race-replacement issue..which just so happens to be the number one issue facing Native Born White Americans. Barack Obama is the face of race-replacement..this is exactly what the Yale Professor meant by Barack Obama being transformative. </p>
<p>Jared should focused with laser beam intensity on the very nasty consequences of race-replacement..followed up with the question&#8221;why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of being race-replaced?&#8221; </p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand why the issue of race-replaement is not made front and center in every MSM appearance by Native Born White American Patriots.</p>
<p>A for as Blacks and Barack Obama go, there is only one thing that needs to be said:in voting enthusiastically for Barack Obamma, they voted for his economic policies. The have no grounds for complaining about a lack of economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Every MSM appearance by Jared Taylor is great opportunity for Jared Taylor to put the issue of race-replacement right before his fellow Native Born White Americans. He must explain in a very detailed way just what Native Born White Americans are going to have to give up for racial-minority status within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;. Do not deal with the race-replacement in a round-about way&hellip;it&rsquo;s one midnight before midnight for Native Born White Americans within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;. On the most fundamental level, Barack Obama is about the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority.<br>

		<p>The mild nature of the interview, although frustrating, is to be expected from such a mainstream venue. The most important point came at the end, when Mr. Taylor was able to get in a mention of the website and his new book. Notice how this guy Schikman went out of his way to slight the title. Paved with Good Intentions may be a good one but White Identity is exactly the kind of title we want mainstream whites to be looking into nowadays. The message does keep advancing. Who knows what a radio interview will sound like two years from now? </p>

<p>I totally agree. Even the most dumbed down, ignorant White neocon and lefty in this country might identify with being race replaced.</p>

		<p>I expected a lot of Obama bashing. Instead Jared Taylor pointed out that whites are not responsible for the persistence of racial problems in America, and he explained why we are not.  </p>

<p>It was sent to me and I have to conclude that it was satirical, however I would advise everyone to be afraid. There are hundreds of thousands of Eboneeshas out there.</p>

		<p>To #3 Jupiter7, I agree with everything you write.  The only person with access to the MSM that comes close is Pat Buchanan and we all know what the neocons and mainstream cons did to him.  I loved watching him say that Obamacare and the cuts to Medicare are basically the taking from whites and giving to minorities, especially hispanics.  </p>

		<p>LOL@The Ebonisha&rsquo;s spelling bee jokes&hellip;.</p>
<p>Actually, whites are underrepresented in the national spelling bee-  no it&rsquo;s not because of affirmative action Blacks but because of brainiac Indian kids who outstudy whites by a large margin-<br>

		<p>Hey they kept talking about Rodney King in the televised interview.Here is some food for thought.</p>
<p>Rodney King was resisting arrest he was lucky he wasn&rsquo;t shot. He was so doped up the police couldn&rsquo;t taze him. </p>
<p>Rodney King pushed a female police officer to the ground when she confronted him. </p>
<p>Rodney King got a $40,000,000 judgement against the city of LA.</p>
<p>Rodney King has had numerous dui violations since he won his award. $40,000,000 will buy a lot of crack and booze. </p>
<p>There was no injustice committed at  all. All the cops were trying to do was cuff this creep. </p>

<p>Actually he&rsquo;s said that before or at least the media attributed this quote to him in the past&hellip; &#8220;Why should whites be expected to celebrate their declining influence and numbers&#8221;?</p>
