<h1>CA Commission Considers Gutting African-American Political Stronghold</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>New American Media, July 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Fourth of July holiday weekend, when Americans were taking the time to celebrate democracy, the California Redistricting Commission (CRC) was considering a move that would cripple African American political power.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CRC&rsquo;s process as they develop the next round of maps would divide South Los Angeles, dissolving years of hard-won African-American voting power and multi-racial unity,&#8221; said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, of the African-American Redistricting Collaborative (AARC).</p>
<p>It would effectively and completely cut out a long-time African-American stronghold of political power  &mdash;  eviscerating the African American population in the 33rd Congressional District, a seat currently held by Congresswoman Karen Bass and previously, the Hon. Diane Watson, and the late Congressman Julian Dixon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The AARC worked with the Asian Pacific American Legal Center (APALC) and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) to produce and submit a set of &#8220;Unity Maps&#8221; to the CRC. The &#8220;Unity Maps&#8221; reached a compromise that appeased African American, Asian American and Latino citizen groups when it came to district lines.</p>
<p>The CRC&rsquo;s visualization instead, divides South L.A., pitting African-American interests against Latino interests. The CRC should not continue on this course. Especially if it is predicated on undisclosed reports and data.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the commission&rsquo;s best intentions, as represented in its first mapping proposals, African Americans appear to come up short, are neutered politically in their strongest areas and are faced with the reality that such plans are not invested in thriving Black Los Angeles.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If people of good will, including Blacks, do not respond to this threat to &#8220;our&#8221; collective political power, then &#8220;we&#8221; cannot complain or rush to sue when the final maps leave Blacks divided, attached to unfriendly neighbors and without leadership that will respond to &#8220;our&#8221; concerns.</p>

		<p>Part of the reason is that Hispanics have driven a huge percentage of blacks out of the neighborhood formerly known as South Central.  Eventually, the San Gabriel basin will have so few blacks that there will be no more black politicians elected out of there to statewide or Federal legislative offices.  Maxine Waters (native St. Louisan, please accept my apology) only hangs on because of incumbent name recognition.</p>

<p>LOL! </p>
<p>Are you kidding me? &#8220;Thriving&#8221;? </p>
<p>I guess if using taxpayer money to pay for your Section 8 apartment, your EBT card, your WIC, your MediCal, your day care, is considered &#8220;thriving&#8221; ?</p>

		<p>This will play out more and more on a national level as the Hispanic population steadily increases.  The black gravy train installed by delusional whites is slowly coming to an end.  At the same time, the white population will be decreasing causing less tax dollars to be passed out.  As the whites become the minority, the path to the end of this once great country is ensured.  What a shame.</p>

		<p>Ironically, this just might help blacks. Gerrymandering a black district in Georgia to ensure a black got elected helped elect Newt Gingrich to the House because it took Democratic voters from his district. Blacks vote overwhelmingly [like 95%] Democratic, but it takes only 50% plus 1 vote to win an election, so approximately 45% of their votes are wasted. If, on the other hand, blacks were spread out in multiple districts, ALL their votes can go to help elect candidates who are sympathetic to their cause anyway. They just might not happen to be black.</p>

		<p>What the afro-Americans haven&rsquo;t grasped is the latinos are over running them and are far more racist than the white devils ever were.<br>
This is the dilemma for blacks, other minorities are out competing them and/or could care less about their legacy of slavery.  And it will be a whole lot harder to invoke the analog of white guilt among fellow minorities.</p>

		<p>Blacks are in for a rude awakening once Mexicans are entrenched and Whites are numerically insignificant. Then they will find out that the White Left doesn&rsquo;t care about them, they were only using them against other Whites.</p>
<p><br>
All this &#8220;multi-racial unity&#8221; was a joke, because its foundation was the hatred and dispossession of Whites. With that accomplished, the charade will be dropped, and Mexicans will not shy from voting their own interests. There is nothing the Blacks can do about this.</p>

		<p><em>&#8220;Losing our African-American political power would not only harm the African and African-American population, it would also threaten the civil rights or every cultural group in the state, especially those who have long suffered from under-representation.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Replace African-American w/ European-American and read it again.</p>
<p>Ps. The link to the original article isn&rsquo;t working. There&rsquo;s a typo near the end, inside the three dashes.</p>

		<p>Multi-racial UNITY???  Are you kidding me???  Good God, Marqueece (who has a twin named Pharteece)   &mdash;   the racial DISunity here is so bad that people are LEAVING more than they&rsquo;re coming here, for the first time ever!!!  I myself am leaving the LA area, where I&rsquo;ve spent most of my life.  (And, hey, y&rsquo;all, didja notice they said SOUTH Los Angeles instead of the more accurate but un-PC &#8220;South CENTRAL Los Angeles&#8221;???  Tsk. What a crock.  Southern CA is now an area full of places you can&rsquo;t go if you&rsquo;re white (unless you want to commit suicide).  If it isn&rsquo;t Tijuanita (Little Tijuana), it&rsquo;s Watermelon &amp; Chitlins City, with a few white areas in between.  Not the ideal place for somebody like me.  I&rsquo;m an old lady and I want to live in peace and safety.</p>

		<p>&#8220;pitting African-American interests against Latino interests. &#8220;</p>
<p>Wait, I thought diversity was a strength, and that &#8216;we&rsquo;re all just the same&rsquo; and that minorities share a common history and interests.</p>

		<p>These complaints will have little impact. The Latinos do not suffer any white guilt and when their interests conflict with black interests the blacks will find themselves bulldozed over.</p>
<p>Tough luck,  they never realised how good they had it, sponging of the whites and now they are going to get a shock when the Latinos take over in California.</p>
