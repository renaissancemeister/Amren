		<p>Typical.  This is so predictable.  Maybe it isn&rsquo;t news to the media. Maybe they EXPECT blacks to behave this way so it really isn&rsquo;t news worthy.</p>
<p>Now, when WHITES do this (so rare) it IS news and the media is all over it. Since whites are more civilized, there is more interest and more shock when we do this. It is expected of blacks, so where is the shock anymore?</p>
<p>When I read any story about &#8220;gang&#8221; violence or rape, I automatically assume BLACKS are involved. The media doesn&rsquo;t have to mention it. They know we know.  wink wink.</p>

		<p>While white liberals are often truly naive about race, those tweets show that blacks know the truth as much as any AR reader. They just don&rsquo;t like it when non-blacks notice too.</p>

		<p>This is an AR post for the ages.  I&rsquo;ve always said that nobody knows black people better than other blacks.  Black people who have political and governing responsibility over other black people, even if the governing blacks are proud of their careers opposing Jim Crow, segregation and apartheid, will salami slice their way back to Jim Crow and seggy and apartheid one law and ordinance at a time.  </p>
<p>For some reason I&rsquo;ll never know, some up and coming rapper on Twitter decided to follow me awhile back.  I told him to look at my tweets and my blog to make sure he knew who I was all about and the kind of &#8220;bigot&#8221; I am, but he told me that he knew and didn&rsquo;t care.  So I followed him to be cordial, but my eyes usually skip his tweets.  A few weeks ago, after the &#8220;Coventry&#8221; black wildings in Cleveland (he&rsquo;s in Cleveland), he tweeted something along the lines of &#8220;black people don&rsquo;t know how to act SMH&#8221; in reaction.</p>
<p>Notice urban politicos always trot out more cops and more cameras as the be all and end all solution to violent crime.  They didn&rsquo;t do very well in this instance.</p>

		<p> Yet another exhibit for the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t let &#8216;em gather in a mob&#8221; series on blacks. I&rsquo;d never heard of that website before, and will bookmark it as obviously I&rsquo;ve already done with AmRen.</p>
<p> Baltimore is yet another of those eastern cities plagued by senseless, often deadly violence committed almost entirely by blacks. Perhaps if websites like this one and the one bearing this article keep publishing the details that the mainstream media wants to hide, White America will finally wake up to the peril it faces.</p>

		<p>Wow! Are those tweets for real? I find it hard to believe that many Blacks have that attitude about their own AND willing to advertise it. If these are for real, then there is hope. It is these people who follow the Whites but would be quite capable of running their own communities. <br>
 This is a topic that needs more reporting and research. This could be part of a major breakthrough in race realism. </p>

<p>Brilliant blogging by Unamusement Park   &mdash;   whom I am glad to see getting recognized by AR. But then, it&rsquo;s a mutual admiration society between Unamusement Park and AR: the former&rsquo;s home page carries a picture of Jared Taylor (along with other Race Realist luminaries as Darwin, Galton, Arthur Jensen, VDare&rsquo;s Peter Brimelow, and, uh, the late Amy Biehl. </p>

		<p>Until things shake out, to put it one way, whites will need to use their resources and intelligence to avoid this sort of horror. I&rsquo;ve already seen it occurring. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p>For the the July 4th weekend fireworks my girlfriend and I avoided the &#8220;public&#8221; displays. We live in a large midwestern city - and not a place known for civilized black crowd behavior. But this applies to any city. </p>
<p>First, avoid all publicly (read: FREE) sponsored events. Whether it&rsquo;s July 4th or Memorial Day or whatever. Avoid close-in suburbs and any place near a bus or train line.</p>
<p>Next, find a pay-to-enter event. We went a large race track that had an excellent fireworks display (set to music) but it costs $10 to get in. They easily had 10,000 plus in attendance - it was 98%+ white. Not one problem despite 40 minutes of loud noise and bright colors.</p>
<p>Essentially, move all these events to less accessible areas and charge to get in. That is a guaranteed way to virtually eliminate black problems.</p>
<p>I know the inherent concerns. First, we pay for these &#8220;public&#8221; events we can&rsquo;t use. Also, this comes down to a &#8220;black-free&#8221; tax we have to pay. But in the current climate it remains both necessary and legal. Lastly, some less well off whites will suffer. We have to acknowledge that fact and help in some way</p>
<p>All city festivals should be gated and have an entrance fee. If the city doesn&rsquo;t go along, then have the group(s) sponsoring the event hold it privately.</p>
<p>This should become the norm.</p>
<p>What will happen is that the cities will eventually find these &#8220;festivals&#8221; to be more trouble than they are worth - simply excuses for black barbaric behavior. Blacks couldn&rsquo;t care one iota for what is being celebrated - July 4th being a good example. If something is free and is touted as a &#8220;celebration&#8221; they show up. </p>
<p>Furthermore, whites should stop attending or tacitly promoting these city festivals that draw black crime or where it is known that large numbers of blacks turn out. That means less money to vendors, etc&hellip;and the market itself will force these little uprisings out of business.</p>
<p>Whites have way more may power than we care to admit. The NAACP cannot respond to all of these changes at once and certainly not to one-off events like fireworks displays. By the time they figure out what to do the event is over. In addition, the NAACP and their enablers only have so much money. We can bleed them dry as they yell and scream because it will cost $15 to get into Irish-Fest when it used to be free. </p>
<p>It may be a new form of Jim Crow so I propose we call it Dr. James Crow, II - it sounds better and has a more moneyed ring to it.</p>

		<p>There seems to be a panic/sense of hopelessness on AMREN that the White race is headed for extinction because it won&rsquo;t fight back against black violence. But as one black girl said to me in 1989  &mdash;  &#8220;Black people don&rsquo;t stick together.&#8221; The tweets in this story prove her right. Blacks aren&rsquo;t a tight, organized force marching toward victory; rather they&rsquo;re a disorganized mob (distrustful of each other) with no strategic plan.</p>

		<p>Many ordinary black people  &mdash;  unlike their leaders and unlike most white people  &mdash;  are willing to say what we should all be thinking: black people, compared to white people, are innately violent and criminal, and you can&rsquo;t put too many of them in the same place without someone getting killed. Harsh, I know, but this is the only theory that fits the data.</p>
<p>When the media won&rsquo;t tell you the facts about black crime, go straight to the source: black people who are fed up with it themselves.<br>

<p>Areas where poor Southern Whites reside (unless it is more than 5% black) are some of the safest in the United States (eg., Appalachia).  All racially-conscious whites &#8220;should&#8221; already be aware of this!</p>
<p>And I am sick and tired of this liberal nonsense that poverty is to blame for crime.  During the Great Depression, when people were truly broke and starving, and the government welfare train had not yet pulled out of the station, White Americans (and even most blacks but probably for different reasons like Whitey didn&rsquo;t tolerate bad black behavior back then) did not resort to crime (perhaps an occasional petty theft incident but certainly no assault or worse)!  Eventually excuses become reasons.<br>

		<p>I cannot help but feel that many (if not all) of these mob attacks are being covertly organized by someone outside the &#8220;community&#8221;. It seems to me that if the local constabulary picked up a bunch of the agitators that an investigation into their phone records might prove to be revealing. I&rsquo;d be genuinely surprised if they all turned out to have blister-packed pay-as-you-go untraceable throwaways. The Yutes usually have too much concern for status to have an inexpensive, no-contract phone.</p>
<p>But then again, good luck finding a police organization willing to risk the racial profiling accusation. </p>
<p>  As for avoiding these mobs..something tells me that as HUD and Section 8 have been used as hammers on safe, white neighborhoods, your enemies will find a way to get these criminals into these &#8220;safe&#8221; events. A lot of the &#8220;charitable&#8221; &#8220;youf&#8221; organizations in other counties neighboring mine fill huge, extended Ford and Chevy vans with &#8220;youfs&#8221;, in full gangland regalia and haul them here to shakedown white shoppers for donations to various anti-gang (oh suuurre!) activities leagues.</p>
<p> Some of the patter these kids give out with is hilarious. One asked me if was concerned with kids getting into gangs, and was I wiling to help. I told him that no, I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of gangs..I was afraid of being legally prevented from defending myself from them. I got a knowing look and polite farewell.</p>
<p>  Moving away from this will soon be off the options list. What&rsquo;s left us? The poles? The Yukon territories? Mars? </p>

<p>One just has to be smart about these things.  We drove to Boulder to spend the holiday with my mother.  For the fireworks at Folsom Field, we slathered up with insect repellant and then walked 1/2 mile to a park in the quiet suburban neighborhood where mom lives, and watched while sitting on the benches.  We were the only ones there.</p>
<p>No rowdy drunks, no police sobriety checkpoints, no violent blacks or Chicanos, and no traffic jams trying to drive back across town.  We could also see fireworks over the Lafayette/Louisville area from where we sat; two displays for the hassle of none!</p>

<p>Many blacks among themselves &#8220;tell it like it is.&#8221; Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t have an open dialog about these persistent racial problems, outside of &#8220;fringe&#8221; publications/websites like AR, without being shut down by the controlled media.

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
When I read any story about &ldquo;gang&rdquo; violence or rape, I automatically assume BLACKS are involved. The media doesn&rsquo;t have to mention it. They know we know. wink wink.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The problem with this is that nobody &#8216;wink-winks&rsquo; at the 30-40,000 dollars a year it takes to lock up 3-5% of the population (Black Males, 14-44) and nobody &#8216;nudge-nudges&rsquo; the reality that 32% of all blacks born after 2001 will spend at least part of their lives in jail.</p>
<p>This from a group which, while forming 13% of the population overall, is so rejected as a group from the polite company of other races that Unconstitutional Race Laws (let me repeat that: _bigoted_ race profiling legislation) has to be enforced to ensure that they have enough money and privilege to be considered able to participate in our society.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go for shock tactics as the alternative.  Because that just hyperbolizes and melodramaticizes the obvious.  But Code-Speak is also wrong because it lulls you to sleep, safe in the belief that you &#8216;know&rsquo; what is wrong.  When you really don&rsquo;t.  </p>

I lived in downtown San Jose, California when the area was engulfed by an influx of impoverished Vietnamese war refugees. I would often get off work at 10:00 pm, and walk three miles through the downtown area to get home. Nothing ever happened to me. I would risk my life if I tried that at my present location. </p>

		<p>Blacks are the real problem for the US, just as Muslims are the real problem for western Europe. Dealing with our problem is harder, because they belong here, unlike Europe&rsquo;s Muslims, who are overwhelmingly recent immigrants, and can conceivably be sent home.</p>
<p>The only immediate private solutions I see are: gated residential communities, private schools, suburbanization of office space&hellip; all stuff that&rsquo;s been going on for a while.</p>
<p>Political solutions would be the shutting down of welfare, building more prisons, getting smarter about policing. None of that is on the horizon  &mdash;  an illustration of just how muddle-headed our politicians are.</p>
<p>Many of you might wish for the revolution, but it won&rsquo;t happen, and that  &mdash;  IMO  &mdash;  is a good thing.</p>

<p>I agree- San Jose is VERY despite being over 50 percent minority because we are low on Blacks and high on Asians. Can I ask where you live now? I live in Cupertino which is now about 70 percent &#8220;minority&#8221; of which 99 percent are Asian.</p>
<p>I also agree tend to think some of the twitter posts may be for real as &#8220;decent&#8221; Blacks are more likely to acknowledge their races&rsquo; pathologies in private. </p>
<p>Heck; I can even tell you that we Indians are also in two minds about our race as well. I often hear Indians at parties talking about how Americans have &#8220;poor family values&#8221; due to high divorce rate, putting elders in nursing homes, and less commitment to family than Asians. They also talk about how whites don&rsquo;t do as well as Indians in math and science in America. They talk about how fast and how much India&rsquo;s economy has grown in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>However, every once in a while an Indian will privately admit that only whites can create modern industrialized nations with human rights. Whites invented math, science, and technology and while Indian immigrants may make good workers in those fields, whites are the ones originally responsible for Silicon Valley&rsquo;s technology. Jobs are being outsourced to India now and some people will say the only reason India&rsquo;s economy has grown is due to WHITE countries outsourcing jobs there. While Indians can &#8220;behave&#8221; when in white nations (unlike Africans), only whites can create nations with high standards of living and run a smooth, fair, and just economy.</p>
<p>Only whites care about human rights that extend beyond their immediate kin. Indians may have &#8220;family values&#8221; in sense that divorce is low, parents and kids stay together for life, etc. but people have few individual rights. Parents have the right to beat up their kids for not doing well in school and people are expected to stay in miserable marriages to avoid bringing family shame. There is no concept of individualism, humanity, and freedom in India.</p>
<p>I, myself, am two minds about race- sometimes I will come on here talking about how well behaved and smart Indian immigrants are and that we commit fewer crimes and have higher SAT scores than whites.</p>
<p>Other times, I will stand up for white nationalists thinking wishing they would accept me as an honorary white person.</p>
<p>If I can be in two minds like this, I think some Blacks may be as well.</p>
<p>Just my two cents from a rambling Indian.<br>

<p>Actually the counties nearer Delaware are pretty good. Cecil county where the new Hollywood Casino in Perryville and also Harford County where Havre de Grace is. I have relative who lives in Havre de Grace. She describes Cecil County as rather &#8220;Rednecky&#8221; but says that she feels pretty safe there. Cecil county is one of the poorest in the State but has really nice down to earth White Folks. Yes, the once great city of Baltimore is now pretty much an &#8220;inner city. We were at the Harbor two weeks ago during the day and on the way back to HdG drove through a good stretch of the city. Very depressing! Except for the Italian section with restaurants it&rsquo;s big time Afro.<br>
Can anyone name one once great city on the Eastern Seaboard that&rsquo;s still great? Manhattan for the most part is still OK due to the very strong NYPD presence that began under Giuliani. Brooklyn, The Bronx and Queens ain&rsquo;t what they used to be. Even Boston is now plagued with B &amp; H gangs who make the Irish look like a bunch of altar boys. </p>

I certainly appreciate your views on this, and your candor. <br>
It&rsquo;s not easy for anyone of any group which is culpable (and ALL groups are culpable for something), to admit it, and then sort it all out, whilst keeping their self - esteem intact. But that&rsquo;s what highly developed individuals do.<br>
Thanks. <br>
 You are indeed an &#8220;Honorary White Person,&#8221; at least in my book. No insult intended!<br>
Of course, the best of India has always been very good, and the best of India need pay tribute to no one.</p>

<p>  Once again a post of yours has prompted me to set aside my misgivings about my marginal language skills, my lack of coherent, objective opinions and my threadbare education and respond.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m not even sure you&rsquo;re a Dravidian-the people most Westerners associate with India.,white people of liberal leaning DO at times put on an anonymous &#8220;ethnic&#8221; persona to combat what they see as, or rather, what they&rsquo;ve been inculcated to see as, &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>India WAS (from the available evidence) a major Aryan stronghold many thousands of years ago, and like every white empire it seems, wound up trod in the dust. Do not modern Hindus to this day wait for a saviour with blue eyes and blonde hair? </p>
<p>  I know many Indian and Pakistani business people that are appalled at white passivity in the face of our present problems and many have confided in me that they will return to their countries of origin if it looks like the White folk will lose complete control of this nation. Many have told me of their disgust with the behavior of other non-whites and they fear living under the tyranny of a government like South Africa&rsquo;s, for example. They appreciate my candor as I appreciate theirs..it&rsquo;s not often that unalike peoples can share common ground. </p>
<p>    You have value on your own, and in yourself. And I think you understand that. It&rsquo;s my folk that are barren of an identity and the self-respect that goes with it. It&rsquo;s going to be a long, hard climb back home for us. </p>

		<p>Poster #29 - you got it right.  My own spiritual teacher is Hindu, and there is none better.</p>
<p>I AM MOVING to a close-to-all-white area.  I&rsquo;ve found some places there that I like, and as soon as I get business here taken care of, I&rsquo;m on my way.  I&rsquo;m not saying where because I don&rsquo;t want there to be a white stampede to there - it&rsquo;s sort of rural and I like it that way - but fellow whites, look around.  You can find places where you&rsquo;re relatively safe.  They DO exist.  If a 66 year old widow can find such a spot, YOU can.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is there any place good to live in Maryland or is it all like Baltimore?&#8221;</p>
<p>As with everything, check the percentage of black populace in a given area and you will know where the crime is. The safest areas are surely the ones in the north and the east, both farther away from the cities. There are some safer areas to the west of DC that mostly have a white population due to housing prices in those areas, however, blacks tend to commit their crimes wherever they can reach easily and liberal policies in Montgomery County make it hard to defend yourself without being punished for doing so. The entire strip between DC and Baltimore (Price Georges County) is a crime-ridden hellhole, much like DC or Baltimore and sometimes even worse.</p>
<p>I live in one of the white parts (&gt;90% white, household income &gt;$100k) but close to a city and I can&rsquo;t wait to move. While it&rsquo;s convenient to live, the influx of crime from the black parts makes it not worthwhile, especially since police don&rsquo;t really do anything and if they do, the judges have a rather expansive &#8220;do not send the black to jail, do not cash $4000&#8221; policy. </p>

		<p>I manage a Hotel in downtown Baltimore, I work over night and deal with this stuff daily.</p>
<p>I maintain a very high standard and keep my great guest&rsquo;s happy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the locals have sent shock waves of fear through the out of town visitors.</p>
<p>I find it hard to be truthful when they ask me is it safe here?</p>
<p>You cant lie but you have to when it comes to keeping business.</p>
<p>The local clubs that have opened up in the past few years spitefully close to our hotels, host crowds of violent, confrontational and uncontrollable crowds, these people, and i use that term loosely are not at all afraid of intimidating visitors and defying the Police.</p>
<p>Baltimore is one of the scariest cities I have seen in years.</p>
<p>The Police here have there hands tied by the NAACP and ACLU this weakens them in the eyes of the average criminal.</p>

<p>But when are whites going to realize that running away isn&rsquo;t the answer.  They follow us everywhere we go.  When will we be strong and say, &#8220;Enough!  Stop following us.  We don&rsquo;t want you.  You are not welcome here&#8221;?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many blacks among themselves &ldquo;tell it like it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they are talking about one of their own, they slander &#8220;triflin&#8221; blacks for being lazy and sucking the resources produced by working people and say &#8220;actin&rsquo; a fool&#8221; about blacks engaging in violent criminal behavior. I listen to black talk radio to hear what they are saying and thinking, and when they forget that white people might be listening they often call out the screw-ups within their own community with fiery language in the same vein as Chris Rock&rsquo;s famous &#8220;I Love Black People, but I hate&hellip;&#8221; routine.  </p>
<p>Of course they go right back to ranting in support of their own racial victimology, but every so often they go off on fellow blacks in a frank way that may surprise many white people, particularly liberals.     </p>

		<p>Unamusement Park seems to be with a new generation of white people who are not afraid to speak up. And he does so in an intelligent and sometimes amusing manner. It&rsquo;s worth checking out his website. </p>
