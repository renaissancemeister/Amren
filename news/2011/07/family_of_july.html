			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Baltimore, July 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Baltimore is still dealing with the fallout of Independence Day crime in the Inner Harbor. The shooting of a 4-year-old boy and the fatal stabbing of a tourist remain unexplained.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WJZ spoke to the family of the man who was murdered, stabbed in the neck with a bottle. They say he&rsquo;s the type of man Baltimore wants to attract to the Inner Harbor  &mdash;  a tourist there to spend money. They are outraged and have definite concerns over security.</p>
<p>Joseph Calo&rsquo;s family is still reeling from his murder. The 26-year-old was visiting Baltimore for the Independence Day fireworks at the Inner Harbor when police say a man stabbed him to death with a broken bottle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what?&#8221; his ex-girlfriend Lyndsey Reilly said with tears. &#8220;I was there when his mother found out, and my little girl is not going to have a dad. She had him for a year. That&rsquo;s not long enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His killing was part of a string of violence incidents that included a shooting of 4-year-old Kavin Benson by a stray bullet that hit him in the leg.</p>
<p>Baltimore City Police are still looking for the person who shot Benson. His father sent pictures to WJZ; one shows the two walking on Light Street just before the boy was struck.</p>

		<p>I listened to this story unfold in real time on my scanner instead of going to the Harbor . Baltimore local news took 3 days to acknowledge that both victims were white. The police commissioner continues to say Baltimore is safe. I live here. It&rsquo;s not safe for white people.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s sad is, you can see what kind of household the kid who was shot is being raised in. There he is, in the hospital, and when he sees a camera about to take his picture, he already knows enough to throw gang signs. And the photographer/reporter/editor are too damn stupid to suggest that it&rsquo;s inappropriate   &mdash;   and that it perpetuates the cycle by making the thug life &#8220;cool,&#8221; even for 4-year-old kids who have just been shot.</p>
<p>NOTHING will make the common culture come out against the thug/rap/ghetto culture, will it? </p>

		<p>The video refers to these crimes as &#8220;senseless.&#8221;  I hear that bromide all the time, and I&rsquo;m tired of it.  This wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;senseless violence,&#8221; because this wasn&rsquo;t a crowd of schizophrenics or mental patients.  There was a definite motive, a definite racial motive.</p>

		<p>If I was going to a celebration and saw what looked like a sea of blacks there I would immediately start walking the other way.  If I was constantly worried about the inevitable violence that was going to happen, how could one enjoy himself?  Which begs the question, is violence and mayhem HOW blacks enjoy themselves?</p>

		<p>My mother is a DIEHARD liberal working for an Obama appointee in DC; nothing will ever pop her reality-denying colorblind bubble.  She&rsquo;s constantly telling my husband and I to move to downtown Baltimore with our children because &#8220;it&rsquo;s become such a great place for young families!&#8221;  I tell her about news items like this, and she assures me that violence is only in the &#8220;bad neighborhood&#8221; (as if there is only one little bad spot).  </p>
<p>My husband thinks it&rsquo;s hilarious, having lived in DC area all his life and knowing exactly how awful Baltimore is.  Of course, Mom also advised me back when I was single to move to Detroit because it was supposedly &#8220;a great place for young professionals&#8221;.  She thought I should buy a downtown Detroit condo (?) because of this amazing urban revival she&rsquo;d heard Detroit was going through.  </p>
<p>How can even a party operative Democrat be that blind?  What sort of fantasies must her co-workers spread around the water cooler?!  I love my mother, and she&rsquo;s very book smart, but after a lifetime of listening to her I&rsquo;m more shocked by her liberal delusions than ever.  </p>
<p>Multiculti race-denial gets worse as racial reality gets worse.  Logic just isn&rsquo;t part of the equation.  <br/>

These stories have the same template:</p>
<p>&#8216;Senseless violence against people in the wrong place at the wrong time. It&rsquo; could have happened to anyone, anywhere. A tragic chain of events.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our local &#8216;angry black man&rsquo; radio talk show host was ranting about &#8216;senseless black on black violence&rsquo; this Tuesday. He brought up a shooting that happened last fall in which a black man shot 8 people, killing 4 at a downtown bar.</p>
<p>The incident allegedly happened because someone spilled champagne on the shooter who then shot up the place.</p>
<p>Our angry black radio host explained that real the reason it happened was because of the indignities the shooter experienced everyday at the hands of &#8220;THE MAN&#8221;. I&rsquo;ll go out on a limb here and assume he meant White Man.</p>
<p>So you see, there is a reason behind black violence by blacks against blacks and blacks against whites; it&rsquo;s &#8220;THE MAN&#8221;.<br/>

		<p>Do not go to Baltimore  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m in the nearby suburbs, and I haven&rsquo;t been downtown in years. If I want to see fish, I don&rsquo;t have to go to the National Aquarium. I can go to Petsmart and look in their tanks. This stuff happens all the time  &mdash;  Easter is another big gangsta fashion-show/rumble. </p>
<p>Baltimore used to be a great city. It was fun, and, (almost) safe in the 50s. It has been sliding down ever since the Great Society happened. *sigh* </p>

		<p>Baltimore was rough in the 90&rsquo;s when I last visited there, but people still lived in the homes above businesses. Now entire blocks are red boarded, and crumbling. The city has made the shift from heavily black &amp; barely functional, to nearly entirely black, and not functional. No matter how much the realtors try to promote the harbor area to move white people back in, most of them wont stay as soon as they have children because of the property crime, the violence, and open racial intimidation. The harbor attack is just an extension of that last item, and it will be swept under the rug as soon as the news media forgets about it. </p>
<p>The true costs of having a growing black population in our county is not just the losses to productivity, income losses to whites due to AA in schools, and businesses   &mdash;   but it is the loss of nearly every American city, and the decline of civility as a culture. Ultimately, it will be the decline of our civilization entirely. Black culture is simply not compatible with civilization. The 15-20% who *can* make it here, and actually contribute in a meaningful way are not enough to offset the 80-85% who are out causing problems, and more than 40% that are severely criminal. When you have too many problem creators, versus problem solvers the situation becomes unworkable. </p>

		<p>we as white men are targets. I suggest all white men who stand down the middle and on the right take self defense. It only takes 6 months to a year to know some real stuff in boxing and mma. Carry mace and get the first punch in and the last one.<br/>
Blacks think we are weak and they do grow white men weak in Ca. sorry if that ticks you off but truth can lead to change.<br/>
Any body know of a white brotherhood thats not racists or of skinhead fame. Cant stabnd those weak punks.<br/>
Things are bad for us and we need to unite as white brothers in the cause of fair play.</p>

		<p>The question that should be asked of one of these knucklehead reporter&rsquo;s when they describe these murder&rsquo;s and other mayhem as senseless is, I see this one is senseless but could you please tell me which of the one&rsquo;s you have covered make sense? The press should be challenged when they claim the reason they don&rsquo;t mention race in black on white crime is because it has no bearing on the incident, why then in automobile mishap&rsquo;s are they forever describing a vehicle involved as an SUV, as if that fact has any bearing on the accident. </p>

		<p>By now it should be clear to everyone that this continuous violence is a low-level war. My advice to Whites is to avoid the possibility of any kind of confrontation by avoiding, at all costs, crowds which include the possibility of large numbers of blacks.</p>
<p>The victim, in the above case, bought the advertising that the Inner Harbor in B&rsquo;more is safe; obviously it is not. The advertising is just that, an attempt to get tourists to visit and spend money as the article says. This tourist paid with his life!! </p>
<p>While there are many &#8220;things&#8221; I would like to see in some of our formerly great cities, I think I will forego such trips, and stick to the smaller towns and the country. Sad.</p>
<p>The &#8220;fix&#8221; for the problem we face will probably not occur in my lifetime unfortunately as I would dearly love to be part of the solution. </p>

		<p>The system has declared war against its white citizens. We are scheduled for ethnic cleansing. Non-whites are their shock-troops. Observe the casual reaction to black mob violence by the authorities and the MSM! Witness the &#8220;anarcho&#8221; aspect of anarcho-tyranny! &#8220;Tyranny&#8221; will arrive in the form of further abrogation of the constitution, particularly the systems&rsquo; wet dream, firearms confiscation. If we allow ourselves to be disarmed peacefully we will be at the (nonexistent) mercy of the lesser races. Resist, resist, resist!</p>

		<p>The coverup of black on white crime in order to keep white tourism coming to dangerous areas is a reality I saw when I lived in Beaufort, South Carolina from 2005-2007. Beaufort is a pretty place, and is fairly safe due to the Parris Island Marine base nearby, but there is a dangerous underclass of rowdy and criminal blacks who live in this coastal region. When a few rapes of white women by black males occurred during the summer of 2006, the local newspaper didn&rsquo;t publish the race of the perpetrator so as not to scare off tourists who like to come and stay at local hotels and go to restaurants. The almighty dollar rules, and the local businesses would rather have whites risk their lives needlessly than to have them more aware and less likely to hang around night spots that had become dangerous due to black on white crime.</p>
<p>So while small, southern towns with high percentages of black populations are certainly still safer than a city like Baltimore, there is really no safe place when it comes to whites living around blacks in today&rsquo;s U.S. society.</p>

<p>Whites have no sense of solidarity because of 40 years of brainwashing by the Cultural Marxist govt and media. Even if some &#8220;retrograde&#8221; whites act try to make some blacks act in a civilized manner they are likely to be charged with &#8220;hate crimes.&#8221; And even hard-core white bikers probably think twice about touching a black because of the prospect of spending 10 years in federal prison as a result of what would be just be a forgettable minor scuffle if he had hit a white guy.   </p>

<p>I live in Detroit and am involved in real estate.  There are some yuppies moving to a limited number of areas in Detroit.  However, it is still very unsafe&hellip; especially for whites.  I carry a gun and constantly warn the liberal yuppies of the danger.  I would love to know the crime stats on those folks.  The crack-head blacks in the area must have a feeding frenzy on them. </p>

		<p>Noneknown- you need to realize that what you consider &#8220;smaller towns and the country&#8221; is no longer as white as you may think. I am appalled that more and more of what I consider small towns in America are getting more and more black chiefs of police, mayors and other elected officials. Even small burgs now are to be surveilled prior to entering. What a damn shame. </p>

		<p>I have big problems with kids that young being up and out, that late.  I have similar issues with white people thinking they are safe amongst other races in less than equal numbered groups of their own.</p>
<p>I _know_ that one of the reasons we have such a low crime rate is because we walk our own paths rather than follow the stampede.</p>
<p>We lived cheap.  On the Fourth when I grew up, we would put a ladder up against the gutters and I when I was the age of the victim, I would get a piggy back ride to see the whole show, horizon to horizon, complete with popcorn and a glass of milk because it was bed right after and soda pop made me too hard to catch.</p>
<p>Best seats in the house.</p>
<p>I have no idea about the tourist.  I would suggest that if he was serious about his girlfriend and her daughter, he wouldn&rsquo;t feel the need to be in a strange city, &#8216;taking in the sights&rsquo;, without them.</p>

		<p>The mainstream media (MSM)works by creating &#8220;superstories&#8221; and then fitting facts and events into them. To the MSM, violence is always a cycle in which both side are equally culpable because both side equally lack conflict resolution skills.</p>
<p>In a place like the Middle East, this idea can be made to seems to have at least the barest degree of plausibility (even though it actually doesn&rsquo;t) because the Israelis sometime do retaliate against Palestinian violence.</p>
<p>In America, the idea has no plausibility at least with respect to blacks and whites. It has been literally ages since there has been significant white violence against blacks, yet the media persists in talking about racially motivated violence as if it were a cycle in which there were &#8220;flareups&#8221; and &#8220;instances&#8221;.</p>
<p>Over several generations, whites who are confronted by minority populations and the inevitable conflict they know they will face, have simply moved. Whites do this because they do not want to become xenophobic and aggressive, not because they do want to be that way or are that way. They move because they are not that way and do not want to become that way.</p>
<p>One may note, when a town or neighborhood &#8220;changes&#8221; and becomes a multiracial slum, one group of people that may stay behind are motorcycle gang members and people who are simply ruffians. These are people who are unafraid of being frightening to others and who are willing to defend themselves even at the expense of incarceration. Overall, their educational aspirations for their children may be lower so that they also are more willing to accept the inevitable decline in the public schools.</p>

I disagree, if I were to take a guess I would say Calo is a Italian American. He looks about as European as someone can look. To say &#8220;he is not white he is Hispanic&#8221; is absolutely absurd to me. My intentions here are not in insult anyone. However from time to find I will find a post that is beyond ridiculous.

<p>My mother is a DIEHARD liberal working for an Obama appointee in DC; nothing will ever pop her reality-denying colorblind bubble. She&rsquo;s constantly telling my husband and I to move to downtown Baltimore with our children because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s become such a great place for young families!&rdquo; I tell her about news items like this, and she assures me that violence is only in the &ldquo;bad neighborhood&rdquo; (as if there is only one little bad spot).</p>
<p>My husband thinks it&rsquo;s hilarious, having lived in DC area all his life and knowing exactly how awful Baltimore is. Of course, Mom also advised me back when I was single to move to Detroit because it was supposedly &ldquo;a great place for young professionals&rdquo;. She thought I should buy a downtown Detroit condo (?) because of this amazing urban revival she&rsquo;d heard Detroit was going through.</p>
<p>How can even a party operative Democrat be that blind? What sort of fantasies must her co-workers spread around the water cooler?! I love my mother, and she&rsquo;s very book smart, but after a lifetime of listening to her I&rsquo;m more shocked by her liberal delusions than ever.</p>
<p>Multiculti race-denial gets worse as racial reality gets worse. Logic just isn&rsquo;t part of the equation. <br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br/>
It gives me no pleasure to say that I really believe mental illness is a large factor in super- Liberal, Multicultural belief systems. My education is in Psychology (which I took very seriously). I was once a Liberal (by virtue of my youth). I detest party politics, and I try to be objective (although, I&rsquo;m more interested in a USEABLE, PRACTICAL truth in these matters, than infinite hair- splitting).<br/>
So here goes: </p>
<p>I had a girlfriend who had a history of bipolar disorder. She was a DIE-HARD multiculturalist, even though she had some sense in her, and she did show some resentment of PC. She also had some healthy fear and loathing of browns, but like someone drawn hypnotically to danger, she kept bad company sometimes&hellip;she had been educated to think it was good, spiritually. </p>
<p>This, by her mother, who, though kind, was also bipolar. And of very, very poor judgement. Smart, as were they all, but profoundly unwise. </p>
<p>Experience seemed to foster in them exactly the opposite conclusions it might in a balanced person. </p>
<p>And I have a sister who is bipolar. She is a DIEHARD multiculturalist, despite the fact that she has been seriously victimized by blacks and browns her whole life. I mean chased, beaten, threatened with rape, etc.  When confronted about the realities about race, she gets angry, and demands the discussion END.  She cannot bring herself to discuss the reality. For some reason it pains her more than the violence she faces every day. </p>
<p>I know it has always been common for sociopolitical antagonists to label each other as &#8220;mad,&#8221; or &#8220;unbalanced.&#8221; </p>
<p>But I have a sincere belief that Liberalism as it is today, most notably injected with the most strong tonic of MULTICULTURALISM, and all that entails, is a straw for emotionally and mentally unstable people to clutch at. </p>
<p>It moors them, giving them SOME sense of rightness. A sense of moral decency is very important to bipolar people who are also intelligent&hellip;who also had a decent upbringing, and who value hard work, sacrifice, decency. </p>
<p>Because these unfortunate people are often at severe odds with themselves- fighting to establish or restore their sense of self, and self worth (after the continued ravages of their illness, and the intense toll it takes on their self- esteem), Multicultural love just gives them something to hold to, for it is most assuredly a religion.  And they still get the bonus zing of being &#8220;heretical&#8221; religious people. After all, they pretend they are fighting the good fight against a bad, or at least backward society. So They&rsquo;re like superheroes, and members of a church flock at the same time. </p>
<p>Women are so particularly susceptible to this sad belief system. And so many males are feminized, they fall prey in droves, too. It is so strange to witness a religious movement like this. It has grown into a worldwide faith in my time; I have watched the generation just behind me get swept up into it. It is so common, one might say &#8220;why does anyone have to be mentally ill to be a part of it?&#8221; True, up to a point; people naturally must, by and large, follow popular trends, to get ahead. But the most ardent of this movement seem mentally unwell.</p>
<p>Does your mother fit this bill?<br/>

		<p>@21: I understand your point. I live in Pennsylvania and if you research where I live on epodunk, you will find that my county is around 99% White as is much of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>My advice to people who are contemplating moving to safer areas is to research the area through the internet at sites like epodunk as a first step. Very, very informative.</p>
<p>There are still areas, mostly in the northern tier, that I call The Great White North; most people think, sadly, that I am talking about snow!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;First off, Calo isn&rsquo;t white, he is Hispanic. Second off he gets his girlfriend pregnant and never marries her. I wouldn&rsquo;t want him as a poster child for white victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calo isn&rsquo;t white?  The photos sure make him look white to me. His kid certainly is white (not mixed looking.)  More importantly, is southern hoosier saying that it&rsquo;s permissible for a white to be the murder victim of black racist violence because he is not married to his the mother of his child?  What kind of bone-headed thinking is that?</p>

<p>Your mother advised you to live in Detroit and then Baltimore <i>with your children?</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d check to see if &#8220;mom&#8221; has taken out any insurance policies on you and your children.</p>

		<p>Two months ago a young white lady was moving her items into her new rental in Mount Vernon, Baltimore City. A black man walking by shoved her into the apartment and raped her. From the sun online. Welcome to Baltimore.</p>

		<p> &#8220;If I  constantly worried about the inevitable violence that was going to happen, how could one enjoy himself? Which begs the question, is violence and mayhem HOW blacks enjoy themselves?&#8221;  - Eric<br/>
