<h1>Security Tightened for July Fourth in Charlotte</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Times News, June 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Leaders in Charlotte are making plans to ensure the city&rsquo;s Fourth of July celebration doesn&rsquo;t wind up with fistfights and gang scuffles like those that left one person dead on Memorial Day.</p>
<p>The Charlotte Observer reported Thursday that stepped-up crowd-control tactics will be used during holiday activities, including a strong police presence and surveillance measures.</p>
<p>Mayor Anthony Foxx says the city&rsquo;s 11 p.m. curfew will be enforced for children under 16 not accompanied by an adult. Foxx says businesses near the problem areas for Memorial Day&rsquo; will close early to discourage loitering.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Officials say Charlotte needs to demonstrate it can handle large events uptown to reassure Democrats planning to stage their national convention in the city next year.</p>

		<p>They say this every year, but the problem gets worse with each big event. On Memorial Day it included a &#8216;flash mob&rsquo; attack on at least one store. It will be interesting to see the &#8216;fireworks&rsquo; this year. With the new light rail system in Charlotte, it&rsquo;s quick and easy for thugs to hop the Cats line and vanish into the night.  Light rail was the best thing that ever happened for Charlotte hoodlums and low-lifes.</p>

<p><br>
Translation: Charlotte needs to demonstrate it can control the majority black population in the city, so they don&rsquo;t embarrass these &#8220;officials&#8221; and show the country what Charlotte is REALLY like.</p>

		<p>Hopefully we&rsquo;ll have plenty of citizen reporters on patrol during these festivities with video cameras - rest assured that any violence or thuggery that goes down will barely, if at all, be reported in the Charlotte &#8216;news&rsquo; media, which is wholly owned and operated by the democrat-dominated local government, sports franchises, and black special interest groups.</p>

		<p>I know Charlotte all to well and SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;..all efforts at any sort of control over the 4th will fail and there will be multiple shootings (fortunately the black thugs can&rsquo;t seem to shoot straight because of the thuggish way they hold the weapons) with a few actual killings. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m from Charlotte and there have been problems at every single at Independence Day event for the past several years. The problems don&rsquo;t usually happen during the fireworks show, but after as people start to go home. Large groups of Blacks, obviously excited from seeing brightly colored explosions and hearing the thunderous booms, go crazy and run around harassing the people trying to walk back to their cars. After all the families leave, the Blacks loiter around, still worked up from the fireworks, then inevitably get into a group brawl or jump someone. And it&rsquo;s only been getting worse throughout the years as more northern Blacks migrate down here and bring their inner city behavior here.</p>
<p>This upcoming 4th, we&rsquo;re bound to see tribal Black insanity along these lines or worse:</p>

		<p>As a lifelong native, Charlotte has become a pretty miserable place.  It&rsquo;s a city that has grown way too big for its britches so to speak.  It used to be a charming place before it grew too large and &#8216;diversity&rsquo; took over.</p>

		<p>Why am I also certain that they are concerned with a whole lot more than mere &#8220;fistfights? and &#8220;scuffles?&#8221; Well, as other have noted, what&rsquo;s a few &#8220;gang&#8221; murders and such - at least they don&rsquo;t have well-behaved and polite White people coming there to peacefully discuss the issues facing their race to worry about. Whew&hellip;really dodged a bullet there Charlotte!!  </p>

		<p>Knowledgeable folks should avoid these gatherings at all costs. It seems that, for awhile now, any large gathering of blacks ends with violence. I recall a large meeting of &#8220;professional&#8221; musicians in Arlington, Virginia a couple of years ago at an upscale hotel which ended in a riot. The vast majority of attendees were black. </p>
<p>It appears now that ANY large gathering of blacks, meeting for anything, results in violence. Stay away!!!</p>

		<p>Going forward, I think I know how the other side is going to obfuscate the issue.  We have already had a hint of it.</p>
<p>Last summer, there was a concert in New York City, the two big acts were Hanson (a teeny bopper white pop group with one hit in 1997 or so), and Drake (a mulatto-Canadian rapper whose previous career was acting on one of those dime-a-dozen filmed-in-Canada teenybopper sitcoms).  There was the obligatory riot, and the media splashed with &#8220;Riot at Hanson concert.&#8221;  Obviously, it wasn&rsquo;t the crowd there to see Hanson that was doing the rioting.</p>
<p>The scam is going to be scheduling white acts along side black acts at the same concert, so that when the blacks there to see the black acts misbehave (i.e. sun comes up in the east, water is wet, death, taxes, politicians lie), the media can blame the white audience there to see the white act.</p>

		<p>A racist is someone whose says what everyone else is thinking. I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that the majority of the leftist types here are incapable of expressing themselves without the liberal use of obscenities and vulgarity instead of rational ideas.  So many of the statements and replies here are totally incomprehensible as though they were from patients in a mental institution. </p>
<p>When you have no argument shut the HELL up and stop using the word racist as though it were some kind of a trump card that stifles all rational debate about an issue. Try something more original and and intelligent without vulgar references to male and female genitalia. Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer and nothing else.</p>
<p>There are incidents of Black attacking Whites all over this country and are becoming more organized lately.</p>
<p>I grew up in North Philadelphia about three blocks from Connie Mack stadium. Many of my neighbors owned firearms brought back from either WWII or the Korean &#8220;Conflict&#8221;. The hardware store up the street sold shotgun shells for hunting season. In all the years I lived in that neighborhood I never heard a gunshot nor do I remember any incident of a violent crime. On hot summer nights people who didn&rsquo;t have air conditioning would sleep on their front porch furniture. Things changed abruptly when Blacks arrived.  Most people fled the area due to the danger presented by the newcomers. There were numerous assaults, rapes and yes finally gunfire. Some of those older people who weren&rsquo;t able to move were routinely victimized including an 80+ woman who was gang raped and beaten by an intruder. She died soon after as a result of her injuries. one thing has changed. Most of our major cities are Hell holes, as evidenced by what happened over the last few days, our once great urban public school systems are a shambles where a successful teacher&rsquo;s or  conscientious student&rsquo;s day is one in which you haven&rsquo;t been assaulted or killed..  Forget about trying to educate anyone.</p>
<p>The only thing that has been achieved is the building of a vast underclass that is dependent on the largesse of the government via the backs of the productive segment of the society generally those &#8220;evil troll racist White people&rsquo; that you self loathers  love to beat up. As long as the underclass is maintained the politicians stay in power.</p>
<p>You are either stupid or blind if you can&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s going on around you. A few months back a boy in West Philly was killed by a hit and run driver while riding his bike. A &#8220;prayer memorial&#8221; was held a few evenings later in the intersection where he was killed. </p>
<p>The evening ended with shot being fired and several attendees wounded.</p>
<p>A public beach in Chicago had to be closed due to assaults on people by mobs of Blacks who also urinated and defecated openly on the Beach. In Miami&rsquo;s South Beach a Black event had to be curtailed due to riotous behavior and gun play.</p>
<p>Myrtle Beach SC had another round of unruly behavior on the part of Black Bikers who hold their event there. It happens every year and many of the businesses close down during that week but the City threatened them with stiff fines if they didn&rsquo;t stay open. Restaurants reported crowds of Blacks dining then running out without paying the check. The same thing occurred during the opening week of a Golden Corral in Atlantic County NJ. </p>
<p>The Mardi Gras celebration on Philly&rsquo;s Street was ended a few years ago by what the Press called &#8220;unruly behavior&#8221;. The video showed gangs of Blacks running along the street and sucker punching Whites. Gay men in San Francisco&rsquo;s Castro district have taken to carrying bats to protect themselves after numerous incidents of Black men attacking and sodomizing them.</p>
<p>The so called &#8216;main stream media&#8221; spares no effort in hiding the identity of violent criminals if they are Black. Suspects are described by the clothing that they wear, or by a cursory physical description such as height and weight but never race. The same treatment is not given to suspects who are White, Hispanic or Asian (very rare).</p>
<p>The only exception is the cases in which there is obvious surveillance video in retail businesses.</p>
<p>The criminal element of the Black community has apparently taken the election of President Obama as a &#8220;carte blanche&#8221; to do anything that strikes their fancy up to and including atrocious assaults against White people who seem to have lost the natural instinct to defend themselves. It would be encouraging to see President Obama speaking out on this matter but being a typical politician, he&rsquo;ll be loath to do that and possibly lose many of his Black votes. The silence on the part of many of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Black news anchors is also deafening,</p>
<p>This is the way it is in the so called &#8220;post racial&#8221; era and the only finale will most likely be open armed conflict.  At some points White will have had enough and will begin to strike back and perhaps the partition of the US along racial lines will be the tragic solution.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This post above of mine was originally written for posting on a Philadelphia website that reported on the mob attacks on a group of White people a few days ago. Of course it wasn&rsquo;t posted on that other website due to the truth of what I wrote. I thought that I had deleted the first part of the posting since it pertained to the self hating liberal Whites who infest Philadelphia and who when posting feel the need to use the most vile language possible along with the old, totally archaic leftist labels against any Whites who speak their mind. I hope that AR will post this correction. My apologies to all our AMREN readers for the error. <br>

		<p>There is a serious problem in American language today.   It can be seen by the fact that a gang of vicious and violent black racists is called a &#8220;flash mob&rsquo; while a gang of vicious and violent white racists is called a &#8220;gang of vicious and violent white racists&#8221;.   In fact, even a group of Tea Party members on a picnic is called a &#8220;gang of vicious and violent white racists&#8221;.    But blacks could burn down Washington DC, and it would be called a &#8220;Nathan Bedford Forrest&#8221; fire. </p>

		<p>I live within a couple hours driving distance of Charlotte. I don&rsquo;t travel to Charlotte, it&rsquo;s been over fifteen years since I have been there.<br>
For reasons stated above, I will not risk harm to myself or my friends by traveling to Charlotte. And for most big cities, the black crime problem will only increase.<br>
The press, for the most part is ignoring the crime problem in large cities because the overwhelming portion is committed by blacks.<br>
In a few years, most of the large cities will be as barren as Detroit; abandoned by business&rsquo;,deserted by whites, and inherited by a welfare class that just can&rsquo;t understand why everyone left them behind. </p>

		<p>SBPDL has an article stating that a Birmingham paper put a photo of white teens alongside a piece about several of the black rampages that have recently occurred.  If I were rich, I would start and fund an organization comparable to the NAACP to defend whites against unfair attacks!  And, of course, such tactics are not only defamatory; they put people in danger if they believe the peril in Birmingham and other cities is WHITE youth!  Most likely, almost all Americans know better, but what about foreigners and rural whites who actually don&rsquo;t?  The newspaper could have simply shown no photo at all.  Certainly, the whites they exhibited were not any of the particular rampagers mentioned.  <br>
I personally wouldn&rsquo;t attend any event where significant numbers of blacks were likely to be.  If businesses start losing money, or white-majority municipalities get only black attendance (meaning major crime, trash, and destruction), action might just be taken to either control the blacks or dissuade them from coming.  </p>

<p>This brings up  a good point. Why is there no White equivalent to the NAACP, MALDEF, etc? You&rsquo;d think that someone could start one? What about race realist attorneys banding together to start such an organization? Or perhaps some young race realists going into law school or media work with the intent of banding together to form a political advocacy group for Whites? </p>
<p>Might as well try this while we still have something left of the First Amendment. </p>

		<p> They&rsquo;re worried about &#8220;fistfights and scuffles&#8221; ? Get a thousand or so people of any race together and add a fair amount of alcohol and you&rsquo;re likely to have a few fistfights/scuffles. But that&rsquo;s not what the Mau Maus engage in. They engage in mob violence against their own, and anyone else who is in range. They shoot, stab, and bludgeon. They beat others unconscious or to death, with five or more on one. Those aren&rsquo;t scuffles.  It should be addressed accordingly.</p>

		<p>Haha. It is hilarious that they  &mdash;  the good people of Charlotte  &mdash;  want the Democratic Convention there; they have a dense population of blacks, therefore it would behoove them to have it there. I believe that it is a bunch of crap. If people would love the country, they would not tarnish its holiday by shooting each other up and causing overall distress and destruction.</p>
<p>But then again, look what got us this holiday  &mdash;  wars upon wars upon wars, supposedly fought for the freedom we cherish. So the government and city officials should not dissuade them from violence; it will happen regardless of precautions taken. So, why don&rsquo;t they just praise the day for its worth, and not burden the people with warnings of gunfire and murder? It is the chief principle that this country runs on  &mdash;  fear. It  &mdash;  not only the country itself, America, but also the politicians and other benefactors of the money pit it has turned in to  &mdash;  wants the people to use caution upon enjoying the festivities, instilling the fact that we NEED the government; we need their man power, their weapons, and the sharp tongues to save us from killing each other.</p>
<p>Yes, in the end, it looks good that they are reinforcing their security measures, but this small adaptation will not prevent one person from concealing a weapon and firing off 10 rounds before the armed guards even are able to react. This, like the SNIP says, is for reassurance; it merely represents an avenue that the city of Charlotte will take in order to gain some semblance of a city  &mdash;  an appearance of order and respect. The frivolous attempt to stop the disillusioned attackers is almost as preposterous as the Democratic party. But that is not saying much, is it?    </p>

		<p>#12 - The criminal element of the Black community has apparently taken the election of President Obama as a &ldquo;carte blanche&rdquo; to do anything</p>
<p>This statement shows that you don&rsquo;t really understand some important realities with regard to blacks.  Over 50% of all black males commit serious felonies over their lifetime.  Roughly a third of black males end up in prion.  These are only the worst of the worst.</p>
<p>There is no criminal element of the black community (and no black community either, for that matter).  Your average black, given the opportunity, would rape, rob and murder.  Let me say that again, because all whites need to get this.  Your AVERAGE black, given the opportunity would rape, rob and murder.</p>
<p>A handful of blacks can keep it together long enough to enter white neighborhoods and jobs and pretend to be normal.  But remember&hellip;..given the opportunity (happens ALOT to whites who don&rsquo;t know better).</p>
<p>A normal, non-psychopathic black person is extremely rare.  It is only through segregation worse than anything during Jim Crow, worse than any apartheid, that such an obvious thing is kept from people.  And it is actively kept from people.  That handful of blacks that can put forth a face of normality are given big bucks to live in white communities and, well, ACT normal.  They may have a job (where they do almost no work) but their real job is acting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1dHabjH3k" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1dHabjH3k</a></p>
<p>Few whites have contact, at all, with real blacks&hellip;.until they are targeted for victimization that is.</p>
<p>And that is the bottom line with regard to &#8220;crime&#8221;.  Crime implies a deviancy from the normal and a rejection by your society.  Neither of these conditions exists among blacks.  A black person taking a victim is acting just like virtually all other blacks and far from being rejected, such behavior earns a black person respect (if it doesn&rsquo;t earn him a bullet, that is).</p>
<p>For nearly the entire time blacks have been in contact with whites, they have targeted us AS A GROUP for violence.  Only in the last few decades has that been met with anything less than brutality by whites.  When we stopped treating such incidents as group behavior and started insisting that these are individual crimes, the number and brutality of these incidents exploded.  Most important white areas were ethnically cleansed (a very important topic of discussion for another time is who helped them).</p>
<p>There is a word for all this, and it isn&rsquo;t crime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s war.</p>

		<p>What is being covered up by the city is that in May during &#8220;white&#8221; Speed Street for the Memorial Day NASCAR 600 where the entire downtown is transformed into a social event for the upcoming race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. This year although there was a major disturbance disruption by organized gangs with hundreds of black teens and of course shootings with a death and other injuries. </p>
<p>This &#8220;white&#8221; race festivity is complete with food vendors race cars and country bands meaning this was undoubtedly an intentional act by these hundreds of black teens to clearly disrupt a so called &#8220;white&#8221; event. It is difficult to believe the black police chief and others who run the show in such a liberal city could have not known this would have occurred through police daily informants etc. Did Rodney Monroe allow this to occur and act dumb? That wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard for him.<br>
Also the new 150 million dollar national NASCAR Hall of Fame objected too is located downtown and way under attendance projections as whites nationwide refuse to visit due to security reasons or the perception. </p>
<p>In the same token the new downtown NBA arena cost 500 million for a single team and the owner is black. The 150 million racing Hall of Fame is a one of a kind national museum. Both were paid for with taxes but big difference.</p>
<p>Could it be that the open minded &#8220;diversity&#8221; &#8220;multicultural&#8221; blacks running the city with the 2012 DNC coming with their messiah savior as police and mayor etc are trying to get rid of anything white and especially the hated NASCAR and its white crowds and hope to scare away any future white racing crowds and hurt the racing museum? </p>
<p>Whites better awaken. You are being systematically eradicated.</p>
<p>On a more deeper sinister note the blacks and their gangs who suddenly appeared seemed to appear out of nowhere by the hundreds roving around in bands could have been pre-mediated by the black city leaders authorities and officials to make certain this white race event would never occur again. </p>
<p>Oddly enough even lib whites who run the Observer were the biggest supporters of the securing of the NASCAR museum and events for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>This says a lot about these so called white libs. </p>
<p>When Jared Taylor came to town these same black leaders were ready for him and as we know called the Sheraton and pre warned them that is unethical. They also had lib college whites hired with TV crew. </p>
<p>Meanwhile other whites wanted to appear socially superior such as those on so called conservative talk radio WBT rejecting AMREN. </p>
<p>Do ignorant whites really think this works? They play directly into the enemy hands. </p>

I watched the first video and it was hilarious. It&rsquo;s just a shame that edited that. The other one I saw was obviously staged and probably after the &#8220;filmographers&#8221; had seen the original. All news reporters have the station logo on their mics. This Mau Mau didn&rsquo;t and his wig was super muthaf  &mdash;  -in&rsquo; bad.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Black Violence Plagues US Cities on Fourth of July Holiday Weekend&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saw this headline posted this morning, July 5th   &mdash;   as I had expected. Have to admit, I was at a gathering last night and had just a moment of fear myself at a fireworks show last night.</p>
<p>Four or five shirtleass black &#8220;youths&#8221; jogged through the crowd, one of them talking into a cell phone as the others glanced furvitively around. And for a minute, I thought to myself, &#8220;Sure hope they&rsquo;re not calling their homies to come join them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it only lasted a second. Fortunately, I was at a heartland country music and fireworks show, with a crowd of &#8220;rednecks&#8221; and &#8220;hillbillies&#8221; listening to a band called Confederate Railroad as we waited for a conservative talk show host to come onstage to speak. I don&rsquo;t think the &#8220;youths&#8221; felt too emboldened in a situation like that, outnumbered about 500 to 1 as they were.</p>
<p>It occured to me, how nice it was, to see a group of black kids come by and not even have to worry. I felt perfectly safe. Too bad our cities aren&rsquo;t like that.     <br>

Gee what a coincidence. The negro mayor and police chief and all other negros who run that city are congratulating and patting themselves on the back after the quiet 4th downtown activity and making sure the DNC sees this along with the media negros who run the local newspaper Observer. Thats because they didnt call in their thugs and gangs to disrupt as now they are all on the same page.</p>
<p>Non-naive whites are now fully aware the white Speed Street rioting for NASCAR was a planned staged rig to cleanse the white race crowd out and they are also doing this to starve the NASCAR museum so it will die and leave. This was alll rigged by these same negro leaders of the city who also ran off AMREN in premeditation.<br>

<p>Did you go where I think you went?  If so, is that tea of his as good as advertised?  </p>
<p>I find it ironic that he would want to appear on the same stage as a country music band, (albeit a forgotten two-hit wonder from the early 1990s) with &#8220;Confederate&#8221; in its name.  You may be amazed to know this, but while Rush Limbaugh is to the right of the American political center, he&rsquo;s actually a liberal in his own family.  The Limbaughs, Southeast Missouri&rsquo;s most prominent family of lawyers, is full of John Birch Society members and people who, thanks to Southeast Missouri being mostly Mississippi Delta and physiographically and culturally like the Deep South, cotton country, too, are definitely hard-core racialists.  However, many of them keep that a closely guarded secret in order to suck up to enough important Republican politicians both statewide and nationally in order to get sinecures, judicial appointments (A Limbaugh once handled the St. Louis inter-district deseg matter, and thankfully permitted it to wind down), and what not.  Rush Limbaugh himself bashes the John Birch Society, I think mainly because he&rsquo;s projecting his own inter-family hostilities, because like I said, a lot of Limbaughs are Birchers, and Rush himself was the non-lawyer non-college educated &#8220;black sheep&#8221; of the family for a very long time, and in spite of his success and money, still is to a great degree.  He bashes JBS b/c he hates his own Bircher relatives for their ostracizing him.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too different than the intra-family affairs of the Chandler family that founded and ran the Los Angeles Times.  Otis Chandler, who ran and published the LAT during its peak years of profitability, hated the JBS, ran a long &#8220;expose&#8221; of it in the LAT in the 1960s, but ONLY because he hated many of the Chandler family trust members who were Birchers.  They would have dumped him as publisher in an instant, save whatever he was doing meant the LAT was making money hand over fist.</p>
<p>Never discount &#8220;family feuds&#8221; as a motivation for what people say and do about seemingly unrelated matters.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t much care for NASCAR, but I do know that in the last several years, NASCAR&rsquo;s top flight racing circuit eliminated their race in Rockingham, N.C., in order to have two races in Charlotte and two elsewhere.  Because of that, the track in Rockingham closed down.  So they spit on some of the most loyal NASCAR fans in order to have two races in black-run Charlotte.</p>
