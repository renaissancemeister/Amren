<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/17/population-control-beckham-family">Beckhams a &#8216;Bad Example&rsquo; for Families</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tracy McVeigh, Guardian (London), July 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>David and Victoria Beckham may have been overjoyed to welcome their new daughter, Harper Seven, last week but, according to a growing group of campaigners, the birth of their fourth child make the couple bad role models and environmentally irresponsible.</p>
<p>As the world&rsquo;s population is due to hit seven billion at some point in the next few days, there is an increasing call for the UK to open a public debate about how many children people have.</p>
<p>Now the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, has joined other leading environmentalists in calling for the smashing of what TV zoologist SirDavid Attenborough has called the &#8220;absurd taboo&#8221; in discussing family size in the UK.</p>
<p>Lucas said: &#8220;We need to have a far greater public debate about population, whether it focuses on improving family planning or reducing global inequality  &mdash;  and looking again at how we address the strain on our natural resources. The absence of an open and honest discussion about this issue means most people don&rsquo;t give much thought to the scale of global population growth in recent years. In 1930, just one or two generations ago, the world&rsquo;s population stood at around two billion. Today it is around seven billion, and by 2050 it is projected to rise by a third to 9 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live as if we have three planets instead of just one. It is interesting that public figures, environmental groups and NGOs in general have tended to steer away from population to the extent that it&rsquo;s become a taboo issue. The horrific consequences of China&rsquo;s one-child policy and of other draconian efforts to regulate procreation have, for many, rendered discussion of the subject completely unpalatable. Yet as long as an issue remains a taboo subject where no one talks about it, then there&rsquo;s very little chance of finding the solutions we need.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a view that is being pushed by the UK-based Optimum Population Trust, whose chief executive, Simon Ross, is calling for the government to tackle the UK&rsquo;s high rates of accidental pregnancy and to give child benefits and tax credits only for the first two children. &#8220;That would send a clear signal that the government will support sustainable families, but after that you are on your own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a big issue there, family planning is cheap, yet many people don&rsquo;t use it properly and accidental pregnancy rates are very high. We need to change the incentives to make the environmental case that one or two children are fine but three or four are just being selfish.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Beckhams, and others like London mayor Boris Johnson, are very bad role models with their large families. There&rsquo;s no point in people trying to reduce their carbon emissions and then increasing them 100% by having another child,&#8221; he said. &#8220;England is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and the fastest-growing in population terms in Europe. In 15 years we&rsquo;ll have an extra 10 million people here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attenborough has attacked the last two UN climate summits in Cancún and Copenhagen for ducking the population issue. Giving the President&rsquo;s Lecture at the Royal Society of Arts in March, he made a passionate speech about how the world&rsquo;s baby-making was damaging the planet and called for every country to have a population policy. &#8220;The sooner we stabilise our numbers the sooner we stop running up the down escalator,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifty years ago there were about 3 billion people on Earth. Now there are almost 7 billion  &mdash;  almost double  &mdash;  and every one of them needing space. There cannot be more people on this Earth than can be fed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The population debate has often been overshadowed by what is seen as the disastrous and often inhumane experiment by China, with its notorious one-child policy, and with sensitivity about being seen to criticise birthrates in underdeveloped countries. But campaigners point to the fact that it is the populations of the developed world who use the vast majority of the world&rsquo;s resources.</p>
<p>Lucas said the Green party was not afraid to raise the subject because it was &#8220;fundamental&#8221; to wellbeing. &#8220;The lesson to be learned from China is surely that efforts to curb population growth in a way that restricts individual liberty are dangerous and come at huge human cost,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Policies that focus on increasing access to birth control for all who want it, reducing poverty and inequality, improving food security and tackling environmental degradation are where we should be focusing our attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;At its heart, this is a debate about poverty and inequality, as well as about sustainability  &mdash;  and we believe that strong policies to reduce the yawning gulf between rich and poor should underpin every effort to address it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe that government incentives or laws to that effect are what we need. As a richer country, we face different challenges when it comes to population than those in the developing world, where high birth rates are linked to dire poverty and inequality. It&rsquo;s an equally important issue for both richer and poorer nations  &mdash;  this is a global debate which affects us all.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Could the Guardian&rsquo;s liberal hypocrisy be any more blatant? They condemn two attractive White people for having four kids, but say nothing about the London Somalians having 5-7 kids. The average White woman in England probably has 1.5 kids in her lifetime, compared to 3+ for &#8220;minorities&#8221;. Give me a break.</p>

		<p>Balderdash. Almost ALL population growth in the developed world is due to spillover immigration from the third world. White populations are stable or decreasing and have been since 1970. ANY and ALL discussion on population control must be solely directed at NONWHITE populations both in the developed and third worlds. The very few white families who have a fourth or fifth child are more than offset by the white families who have one child or no child. Until some of this population control rhetoric is directed at the brown populations it falls on deaf ears as shallow anti-white political rhetoric. </p>

		<p>Nobody &#8220;does&#8221; race-treason with the smug panache of the Brits. Maybe a few hundred years of dhimmitude will restore their souls&hellip;if the Saracens even allow the wretches to live.  I feel some sympathy for my racial comrades over there, but for decades, the working class voted in the reddest scoundrels that they could find&hellip;in a buyers market! Their passionately supported unions destroyed British industries without any assistance from banksters or greedy corporate lobbyists&hellip;so the prolos could sit on their bums in housing estates and shoot heroin&hellip;waiting for the revolution, or not. Their only hope, the BNP is going down for the third time. Well, their collective chickens have come home to roost, from the top to the bottom, they are rotten to the core. Great Britain brutalized and bullied the world for centuries. They dragged us into two fratricidal wars and have now decided that racial suicide is the way to go. After you, Old Sport! Drool Britannia!  </p>

		<p>Speaking of taboos, notably absent is any criticism of immigration, or its relation to resource consumption.  </p>
<p>The Beckham&rsquo;s 4 children are easily offset by all the whites who will have no children.  Ending immigration makes room for whites to acceptably have 2-4 children per family.</p>

		<p>The Greens and White environmentalists in addition to being fake environmentalist are also genocidal maniacs. And their genocidal intents are directed towards European people. If they were serious about overpopulation in the UK  the would at  minimum call for a complete shutdown of all Hindu,Sihk,Muslim,Carribean and Afican immigration to the UK. But why does the Native English,Scottish and Welsh population of the UK have the full burden of population reduction placed fully on them? Because the Greens and White Environmentalists want to  replace the Native European population of the UK with high fertility nonwhites. The Greens and White Environmentalists are big fakers who don&rsquo;t give a hoot about the UK&rsquo;s environment-ecology. Behind their phony environmentalism is a vicious race war against the Native European population of the UK. They are demanding that the Native European population of the UK commit racial suicide within the borders of the UK.</p>
<p>If the Native Born White American birthate began to go upwards the fake Environmentalists would scream bloody murder.</p>
<p>The Native English,Scottish and Welsh population of the UK have lost living space to high fertility nonwhites. They are justified in reclaiming this precious living space&hellip;this will require a complete shutdown of nonwhite immigration and mass deportations of nonwhites&hellip;either they do this or the native population of the UK will collapse at some point in time. The same thing will happen in America and Canada. The population collapse of the European populations of the UK,US,and Canada will be preceded by a major ecological collapse in each of these nations. This is the ultimate fate of all three Native populations if nonwhite immigration is not completely shutdown.</p>

		<p>God and nature have a way of seeking and maintaining balance.  Every time man tries to do better, things just get worse.  China, to use his example.  Now men can&rsquo;t find women, because due to the one child law, everybody wanted a male heir.  The fact is that when population gets beyond what can be sustained, it is brought back into balance by famine, plague, war, a self imposed reduction in bringing children into the world beyond what can be provided for, etc.  The problem today is that Whites are NOT bringing children into the world, while all other races are breeding and consuming and expecting the once prosperous White nations to spend all our capital and resources taking care of THEM.  One thing you can universally say about the Third World - they have NO impulse control and NO ability to plan beyond tomorrow.  Nor any real civilized effort to feed themselves - the black given a White Boer&rsquo;s farm, just sitting there thinking seeds plant themselves until the jungle or grassland reclaims the farm, for example.</p>

The Beckham&rsquo;s seem to have been in the news for quite some time.</p>
<p>Victoria applied a smutty connotation as a member of the Spice Girls to raising a large family and David Beckham seems to want to keep the momentum behind his fame going for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Togeather they are the ambassadors of race mixing and money for the third world family.</p>
<p>Its not a good example for a nation to follow be it first or third.</p>
<p>Governments can positively affect over population and it is easier done than said when people control their government.</p>
<p>But that change begins with the white world.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re complaining about a white family that just had their fourth child.  But you will never hear the left complain about a black, Mestizo, or Asian family that has eight children.  Even while Great Britain is being flooded by immigrants from high birth rate countries who themselves continue to have high birth rates the left insists that it is the few white couples with more than two children who are the environmental problem.<br>

<p>We all know that if the British would throw out the muslims in all their forms, Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshi and blacks in all their forms, Carribean, African and muslims, there would be plenty of room and resources for the native born White English to have families of any size the wanted. Also, I BET these people will not DARE to tell the Nigerians, Somalis or other muslims they need to have fewer children, the muslims would simply BLOW SH** UP and begin their usual riots and murders until they got their way.</p>

		<p>The Beckhams can easily provide food and other necessities for their four children. Why isn&rsquo;t the left-wing Guardian complaining about the out of control fertility rate in Sub-Saharan Africa? In the majority of its countries the average woman gives birth to more than 4 kids, this despite widespread malnutrition, lack of clean water, and no modern medicine. If they&rsquo;re woried about the rapid growth of population, black Africa is the place to start. With the exception of a few mid eastern countries like Afghanistan and Yemen, the epicenter of &#8220;indiscriminate spawning&#8221; is Africa. Just go to the CIAs website and run down the list of nations based on fertility rates.</p>

<p>The white population of the world, on the other hand, is not increasing.  Of course, nowhere in the article does it state that the white fertility rate is below replacement.  Thus, the Beckhams are doing a wonderful thing by improving the average in a small way.  Does the article simply want white people to disappear from the earth?  I thought that was called genocide.</p>

But the local St. Louis media in recent years do stories about:  (A) A black man who had over 50 children by over 30 women, and (B) A young black man who had AIDS and spread it to over 100 girls and women some as young as 12, without their knowledge, and he didn&rsquo;t even know he had AIDS, as it turns out, he was (at the time of his being murdered) one of his mother&rsquo;s 21 children, who had in turn begat 105 grandchildren who themselves in turn had begat 110 great-grandchildren.  (Surely those figured are higher by now, this story was in 1998.)  In both stories, the prodigious procreation was mentioned only in passing as gravy for the larger story line.</p>

		<p>Is it so bad for the white race to have children that will be smart and help the planet in the long run,verse the moral and downing of what makes us strong.All whites should try to have 3 to 4 children and help the WORLD from the over throw of us.The USA is so close to a civil uprising.very close.!!</p>

<p>Well Mr. Ross, why in the hell is the English government still allowing fecund third world immigrants to colonize England in large numbers?  According to Professor Richard Lynn, birth rates are as follows:  Whites 1.6, Indians 2.3, Pakis 2.3, Somalis 5.0.</p>
<p>But, you wouldn&rsquo;t <i>dare</i> question the high birth rates of Indians, Pakis or Somalis, would you Mr. Ross?  Only Whites are subjected to criticism about birth rates because you, like the English and American governments, wish to flood White homelands with non-Whites in order to eradicate Native Born Whites.</p>
<p>White birthrates are already below replacement levels; calling for further restrictions of White births (while ignoring massive immigration rates of high-fertility non-White) is promoting White genocide.</p>
<p><i>The 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article II states genocide means any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnic, racial or religious group as such:</i></p>
<p><i>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group</i></p>
<p>The English government, Ross, Green MP, Caroline Lucas, and &#8220;other leading environmentalists&#8221; need to be called out for what they are:  advocates of White genocide. </p>

<p><i>To deny White citizens of White nations the right to preserve themselves - biologically, ethnically, and culturally - is the true example of racism and hatred.</i></p>

The facts are these:<br>
Never mind the Beckhams.As far as Whites are concerned the Beckhams are statisical outliers, far from typical of average White fetility which is well below replacement.They can be ignored in the greater scheme of things, and besides they are wealthy enough to support their own children.<br>
 No. The real problem with &#8216;excess fertility&rsquo; is in the third world and in particular black Africa.But of course the pea-brained trendy lefty jerk who wrote the piece knows this, but daren&rsquo;t mention it, but the Beckhams (a complete irrelevance on a global scale), are &#8216;fair game&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t  believe my eyes when I saw this headline in the Guardian the other day. A successful, affluent, two-parent family being given a hard time in a national newspaper for having too many children? The amount of income tax the Beckhams have, I&rsquo;m sure, paid in England in the years they lived there supported many, many, single parent, non English, non white, non integrating, non earning &#8220;cultural enrichers&#8221;. The whole thing is staggeringly racist- the newspaper would never run a similar headline about a &#8220;family of color&#8221;. Luckily, however, plently of people thought the same- in the &#8220;comments&#8221; section after the piece, many English people pointed this out. You cannot hide from the Internet - in too many reasonable, decent (Anglo) ears, the anti white bell has been rung in the media one too many times, and established  outlets are being called on it daily. The west&rsquo;s awake, it seems, finally.</p>

		<p>I happened to catch &#8220;Bono&#8221; on the Letterman show last night.  He went to great lengths to lionize himself (and GW Bush) for saving 5 million Africans from AIDS over the past ten years.  There was no mention of how the world would benefit from this act.  As far as I can tell, these Africans will go on having sex, making babies they can&rsquo;t feed and requiring more Western intervention to assist them,while they make even more dependent babies.  </p>
<p>Bono is the perfect example of the shortsighted, self-congratulatory liberal.  All I could wonder was why he wasn&rsquo;t help save Irish kids from poverty, or even save his own people by helping some of those Africans back to their beloved nations IN AFRICA?  The answer is ego, of course.  How much adulation could he get from actually helping his own people?  Not nearly as much as he can get through comparing himself to black character myths, such as MLK and Nelson Mandela.  He and people like him have invested in hype of racial mythology for years and will not dispense with it no matter how obviously falsely hyped those myths might be.</p>
