<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/may/18/ethnic-population-england-wales">The Ethnic Population of England and Wales Broken Down by Local Authority</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Guardian (London), May 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What is the ethnic population breakdown of the 54m people in England and Wales? Now we have an answer, right down to local authority level.</p>
<p>The non-white British population has grown from 6.6m in 2001 to 9.1m in 2009  &mdash;  or nearly one in six. The figures were published this week in an &#8220;experimental&#8221; data release from the Office for National Statistics, which also show that there are now a million mixed-race people in the two countries.</p>
<p>The white British population has stayed the same since 2001  &mdash;  because even though there has been an increase in births, there has also been a similar number of people migrating. The non-white British population has grown by 4.1% a year, or a total of 2.5m over the whole period, or 37.4%.</p>
<p>In fact, the only group to actually shrink is the white Irish population, down from 646,600 in 2001 to 574,200 now due to falling birthrates and migration. A rise in the &#8220;other white&#8221; population from 1.4m to 1.9m is not simply due to Eastern Europeans moving to the UK, said the ONS statistician responsible for the report, but also people from the old Commonwealth  &mdash;  countries like Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The mixed-race population has neared a million for the first time  &mdash;  from 672,000 in 2001 to 986,600 in 2009, an increase of nearly 50%. A third are mixed Afro-Caribbean and white, followed by Asian/white. The ONS statistician said this is not a result of increasing birth rates but more that we are becoming less divided: &#8220;the population is mixing up more&#8221;. The highest proportion are in Haringey, London, where 4.4% are mixed.</p>
<p>The numbers report the ethnic breakdown of every local authority area (which we&rsquo;ve mapped using Google Fusion Tables above), which show that in 225 of them, the white population comprises over 90% of local people. That figure is highest in Wales and the North east of England  &mdash;  the whitest borough is Blanaeu Gwent in Wales, where 96.5% of the population is white British, followed by Copeland in Cumbria, where only 2% of the population are not white.</p>
<p>In contrast, Brent, in London, is the most ethnically diverse borough in the country  &mdash;  just over a third of its population counts as white British, with large mixed race, Asian, Black and Irish communities making up the rest.</p>
<p>These figures, published for the third year running, are the most detailed available on the ethnic breakdown of the country before the results of the 2011 census in a year&rsquo;s time  &mdash;  the ONS estimates them by combining data from the 2001 census, the Labour Force Survey and the Annual Population Survey. The figures are not compiled for Scotland.</p>

<p>I used this map of England to check on the racial demographics in and around Birmingham.  Whaddaya know, heavily black.  No wonder guns have a hard time behaving themselves in that city, such that:</p>

		<p>The GrauniadÂ´s (sic) denial of racial differences knows no bounds - why it even extends it to map colour-coding..!  Their determination to ignore or trivialise race or pretend it doesnt exist except in the evil imagination of racists shines like a beacon here. </p>
<p>Any sensible person creating a map designed to illustrate the ethnic composition of a country would use DARKER shades for the DARKER-skinned areas and LIGHTER shades for the LIGHTER-skinned areas. But then that would mean that even they noticed the physical difference between the races and good liberal citizens must all be colour-blind, thank you very Marx.</p>
<p>But on their map (or is it a govt map?) the DARKER-skinned districts are illustrated in the LIGHTEST shade, exactly the opposite of what one would expect and quite confusing at least to me. But I suppose it would be racist to recognise reality?</p>
<p>The Guardianistas really do live in an inverted world.  </p>

<p>The government has foisted invasion and colonization on the nation. And it was all done against the will of the people. What is the punishment for treason?</p>

		<p>I grew up in England, left after college .  All of the neighborhoods I lived in are now &#8221; no go areas &#8221; for whites . So in forty years England went from white to non-white just as Enoch Powell predicted. If I went back to my last home I probably would be killed, because I am white and English. No whites Ever go there, for any reason . This includes coppers and they only go there to arrest whites who stray into town. The multi culti crowd really did a number on Britain. An entire culture was wiped away for ever.</p>

		<p>Speaking of England and Islam:  </p>
<p>&#8220;Islamic extremists have launched a poster campaign across the UK proclaiming areas where Sharia law enforcement zones have been set up.</p>
<p>Communities have been bombarded with the posters, which read: &lsquo;You are entering a Sharia-controlled zone â Islamic rules enforced.&#8221;</p>

		<p>On the original article so many people (the sensitive and &#8216;sensible&rsquo; people I suppose) are commenting that we&rsquo;re all mixed anyway and that &#8216;it doesn&rsquo;t matter what color you are&rsquo;. I wonder if that goes for when you look for a job, a school, or for government housing or when looking for those we should be sensitive to?</p>

		<p>I am shocked by the scarcity of purely White-British areas shown by the data. </p>
<p>It appears that the Volag system used in the USA to drop Third-World refugees into White towns has not been used against the Brits. Most of the rural areas have foreign populations mainly of Asians and white Others; people who, with some exceptions (I.E.: the Ugandan Indian resettlement), are able to reach the UK on their own or through treasonous businesses and universities. </p>
<p>Thus, most of the Blacks are concentrated in cities, as is fairly usual. </p>
<p>A good question is though, who counts as &#8220;other White&#8221;? Is it like in the USA where Arabs are counted as white? What of people of mixed British and Slavic ancestry? And I know there are white people born as British in former colonies who sometimes have serious trouble attempting to return to Britain. See here:</p>
<p>https://www.vdare.com/misc/090623_kurtagic.htm</p>
<p>Anyway, Britain is more or less a land of madness, I am convinced. It is bad enough to have mass immigration, but to criminalize self-defense and free speech? No wonder so many are leaving. </p>

		<p>Great Britain, England really, is a textbook case in how to destroy and subvert a nation from within. Allow the Marxist culture pushers to take over the schools and academia, spread their propaganda and then demographically flood the area with alien people. Result? Culture and country eliminated forever.</p>

		<p>The English and Welsh have not experienced the loss of political power that goes along with loss of territory. Awareness will arive one day. You can bet on it. The realization that what you want depends on the opinion of outsiders will feel like a gut hit. And the feeling of opportunity loss will drive many whites to despair. </p>

		<p>I travel the country with my job.</p>
<p>I visit Birmingham/Luton and Bradford often.</p>
<p>I just do not belive those figures. I have worked in Bradford all day without seeing a single white face.</p>
<p>Its long been known that for various reasons ethnic minorities do not always fill out forms. For instance if you have a very large extended family in one house if they declare them all they may be liable for council tax.</p>
<p>Not to mention all the illegal Asians. something tells me those figures are too low.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;just over a third of its population counts as white British, with large mixed race, Asian, Black and Irish communities making up the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why are the Irish lumped in with Asians and Blacks?  If they were born and raised in Britain, that makes them British white.  And how many of those British whites are in fact light-skinned Indians who were not included with dark-skinned Pakistani &#8220;Asians?&#8221;</p>

		<p>A couple years ago I saw an excellent British film at the local arthouse cinema called &#8220;Brick Road.&#8221;  It was based on a novel of several years earlier.  The whole cast, and everyone in the neighborhood scenes, were first- and second-generation immigrants from Bangladesh.  I kept rubbing my eyes and asking:  Is this London?  Actually, it was.  </p>
<p>The movie, however unwittingly, summarized all that has happened to Great Britain over the last several decades.  If demographic trends keep up, the UK shall cease to exist in any meaningful sense.  Enoch Powell would have been proven right, and if anything, perhaps a bit behind schedule.  </p>
