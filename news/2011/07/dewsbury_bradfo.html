			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), July 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Islamic extremists have called on British Muslims to establish three independent states within the UK.</p>
<p>The notorious Muslims Against the Crusades (MAC) group have named Yorkshire towns Bradford and Dewsbury and Tower Hamlets in East London as testbeds for blanket sharia rule.</p>
<p>The medieval &#8216;emirates&rsquo; would operate entirely outside British law, according to a document on the MAC website.</p>
<p>The MAC group, led by Abu Assadullah, was set up last year and has become notorious because of its violent protests, most provocatively burning poppies during the Remembrance Day silence.</p>
<p>Under the heading &#8216;Muslims should set up Islamic emirates in the UK&rsquo;, MAC says: &#8216;We suggest it is time that areas with large Muslim populations declare an emirate delineating that Muslims trying to live within this area are trying to live by the sharia as much as possible with their own courts and community watch and schools and even self sufficient trade.</p>
<p>&#8216;Likely areas for these projects might be Dewsbury or Bradford or Tower Hamlets to begin with. </p>
<p>&#8216;In time we can envisage that the whole of the sharia might one day be implemented starting with these enclaves.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The call is likely to cause anger among moderate Muslims and community leaders in the areas concerned.</p>
<p>Ian Greenwood, leader of Bradford Council, said people would &#8216;not allow extremists to provoke them into violence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>London 7/7 bomber Mohammad Sidique Khan lived in Dewsbury, which has battled to diffuse extremism in recent years. In 2007, it was alleged that a number of Muslims in Dewsbury were running an illegal Islamic court from a school and similar claims have been made in Tower Hamlets and Bradford. </p>
<p>Tower Hamlets council was last year accused of falling under the control of extremist groups following a documentary by the Daily Telegraph journalist Andrew Gilligan.</p>
<p>The plan is part of the MAC&rsquo;s response to the government&rsquo;s revised Prevent strategy to combat Islamic extremism.</p>
<p>In its document, called Islamic Prevent, the fanatics also call for an end to CCTV cameras in and around mosques. </p>
<p>It says: &#8216;Muslims must get rid of all CCTV cameras from Muslim institutions. Sadly many mosques have today adopted CCTV cameras to spy on Muslims on behalf of the police and local authorities.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Other inflammatory instructions include demanding the release of all Muslim prisoners, a ban on Muslims joining the police or armed forces and a rejection of British democracy.</p>
<p>The document ends: &#8216;We can conclude that measures by the UK government are nothing more than an attempt by them to strip the Muslim community of their Islamic identity and to integrate them into the non-Islamic way of life.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The revised Prevent programme, announced last month, is aimed at tackling home-grown terrorism and radicalisation of students. </p>
<p>It demands stricter controls on extremist literature and a more proactive approach by universities to prevent extremism. </p>
<p>Councillor Greenwood added: &#8216;Extremism is less likely to emerge when people get the opportunity to come together.</p>
<p>&#8216;Local voluntary, community and faith groups, the council, and other public and private sector partners, all work together in Bradford to strengthen community relations and encourage better understanding and respect between all our communities.</p>
<p>&#8216;We believe that this is one of the best ways to build a tolerant society in which extremism plays no part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tower Hamlets and Kirklees Council, the local authority for Dewsbury, refused to comment.</p>

		<p>*&lsquo;In time we can envisage that the whole of the sharia might one day be implemented starting with these enclaves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the most chilling statement for me. Notice they say &#8220;starting&#8221; with these enclaves. The average Briton sees whats going on but are &#8216;muzzeled&rsquo;, just as we are here in the U.S., and they have a sizable population of liberal Whites thats in charge of tightening the muzzel and bashing - sometimes literately - the BNP. Here they OPENLY state their refusal to become &#8220;British&#8221; and their intent of taking over and all this useful idiot - Ian Greenwood -  has to say is &#8220;people would &lsquo;not allow extremists to provoke them into violence&rsquo;&#8221;! Are you serious? I&rsquo;ve got news for you Ian, you&rsquo;ll be one of the first they&rsquo;ll slaughter when the time comes. I&rsquo;m sure your eyes will finally be open wide as they put that sword against your neck, but then it&rsquo;ll be too late.<br>
As I&rsquo;ve said before, its looking very likely that I will live to see the day that Buckingham Palace is overrun and burnt to the ground and the &#8216;royals&rsquo; drug out and beheaded in the street. Also look how easy it was for those &#8220;students&#8221; to attack and damage the limo carring Charles and Camilla - big supporters of muslims by the way -  awhile back. Next time it might not be students and they could possibly be kidnapped and/or killed.        <br>

<p>These people still don&rsquo;t get it, there IS NO MODERATE muslim, there is only islam and it is violent, blood thirsty and intolerant. And THIS fool &#8220;Councillor Greenwood added: &lsquo;Extremism is less likely to emerge when people get the opportunity to come together.&#8221; Should be executed at the first opportunity. It is already to late for the British OR Americans to &#8220;throw muslims out&#8221; only violence, bloodshed and religiouscide will work now and it will be ugly. Facts must be faced, muslims are more than willing to inflice horrendous violence on non muslims and we non muslims must be willing to do the same to muslims till the eviction is complete. It is going to be THEM or US&hellip;.take your pick.</p>

		<p>It might be good strategy to support the separatist Muslims. If they can establish Islamic enclaves, it would set a precedent. Not now, but in a near future, with the U.K. in chaos, it might facilitate White men setting up Western enclaves. </p>

		<p>And yet liberals like Chris Matthews scoff at the idea that some Americans fear the institution of Sharia courts!  What nation&rsquo;s legal system is the basis of ours?  England&rsquo;s, of course!  And anything that occurs legally in any Commonwealth country can potentially have ramifications here.  <br>
Many liberals, of course, would love the idea of Sharia courts in the U.S.  Anything to break down Judeo-Christian traditions!  How the lefties would feel when adulterers and homosexuals are executed can only be guessed.</p>

		<p>Tablighi Jamaat was founded in 1926, in India, by a Deobandi scholar, Muhammad Ilyas, who wanted to raise Islamic awareness among rural Muslims in south Asia. He promised them that by obeying Islamic laws and following the example of the Prophet Muhammad in their personal lives they would one day &ldquo;dominate over non-believers&rdquo; and become &ldquo;masters of everything on this earth&rdquo;.  Ishaq Patel, Tablighi Jamaat&rsquo;s first amir (leader) in Britain, is said to have been on pilgrimage in Mecca when Ilyas&rsquo;s successor gave him a long-term mission to win &ldquo;the whole of Britain to Islam&rdquo;. Yoginder Sikand, a Muslim expert on the movement, says that its ethos of &ldquo;social and cultural separatism and insularity&rdquo; seeks &ldquo;to minimise contacts with people of other faiths&rdquo;. The self-segregation that this encourages is evident in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, where the group has its European headquarters. The Tablighi Jamaat complex – housing its large Markazi mosque and a Deobandi seminary called the Islamic Institute of Education - is based in the Savile Town area, which has an 88 per cent Asian population. The overwhelming majority of its 5,000 residents are Muslims from Pakistan or the Gujarat region of India and some, at home and at work, have little contact with non Muslims. It was on the advice of a Tablighi Jamaat scholar that Aishah Azmi, a Dewsbury teaching assistant, refused to remove her full-face veil in the class-room while helping young children who were learning to speak English. One of the suicide bombers who attacked London in July 2005, Shehzad Tanweer, studied at the Deobandi seminary in Dewsbury and Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 terror plot, was a regular worshipper at the adjoining mosque. Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, was said to have been influenced by Tablighi Jamaat, several of whose adherents were also among those arrested last year over an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic airliners. Shabbir Daji, a trustee and secretary of the Tablighi Jamaat mosque in Dewsbury, told The Times that the movement&rsquo;s aim was &ldquo;unity among all humanity&rdquo;. He said that it had no hidden agenda. &ldquo;We never come out on demonstrations against the Government,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our aim is to make each and everyone &hellip; a better Muslim.&rdquo;  Irfan al Alawi, international director of the Centre for Islamic Pluralism, says the missionary work of Tablighi Jamaat acts as &ldquo;a recruitment agency for jihad&rdquo; in Afghanistan, the occupied territories and Iraq. &ldquo;They go around deprived areas of British towns and cities, knocking on doors and urging young Muslims to come to their gatherings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The mega-mosque complex would become a flagship for Tablighi Jamaat&rsquo;s mission to indoctrinate Muslims with a hatred of the West and the kuffar [non-Mulims].&rdquo;  Tabligh Jamaat has already submitted a formal planning application to construct a new huge  mosque in West Ham, a district in London.<br>

		<p>Anonymous @#5, you miss the point. Once these Muslims have successfully established Sharia in their &#8220;enclaves&#8221; they will push for it to be extended to the whole society - Muslim AND non-Muslim.(I was going to write &#8220;Muslim and non-Muslim alike&#8221;, but this would be misleading, since Sharia treats members of the two categories very differently.) </p>
<p>This is an important element in the overall programme of Islam, which is one of unconditional conquest and subjugation.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>i.e. The end of the Nation State as run by law, not decree and protected by the ability to replace those who fail to enforce that law, fairly.  Which is what those trying to -escape- the Middle Eastern corrupted oligarchies came to England to enjoy the freedom and security of. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The document ends: &lsquo;We can conclude that measures by the UK government are nothing more than an attempt by them to strip the Muslim community of their Islamic identity and to integrate them into the non-Islamic way of life.&rsquo; <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Well _duh_.  If you don&rsquo;t like where you&rsquo;re at and you come to an already established nation to find a different way of life, why would you necessarily expect them to change so that you can reestablish what is broken in your own lands?</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
It demands stricter controls on extremist literature and a more proactive approach by universities to prevent extremism. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is where the cure gets to be worse than the ill.  Because freedom of speech should never be lost at Universities and the the way the Government looks to eliminate &#8216;radicalism&rsquo; is to stamp everyone into cookie cutter outlines.</p>
<p>This is what racial and social integration by economic decree means.  You take such a long leap sideways that to step back from the precipice means losing more than you stood to gain to begin with.  And precedence attaches as a means to make loss of rights for one group apply to all others who were not causing problems.</p>
<p>England is finished as a homeland for whites.  They simply haven&rsquo;t got the depth of country to absorb Balkanization like this.<br>

<p>True enough, but consider; the Kaiser was on the losing side of the great war. Unlike Britain, Germany had no victory to squander. Nor was West Germany in much of a position to refuse the arrival of Turks and others after WW2. The American government put very great pressure on Bonn at the time. Plus there was the stigma of the holocaust. In contrast nobody forced the British to begin their genetic and cultural self-destruction in 1948. Finally I still think the situation in Britain, especially England, is much worse then in Germany. I believe the Kaiser would recognize Berlin more then Churchill would recognize London.</p>

		<p>Anonymous No. 16 - Would not say the situation in England was &#8216;much&rsquo; worse than Germany.  I believe the hugely successful book by Thilo Sarrazin would back me up.  Not an expert in this but after the war the Germans refused German nationality to the Turkish workers and families, but that is not the case now I believe - the EU again!!.  I occasionally follow a German weblog (English version) and it seems as though things are just as bad as here<br>
  </p>
<p>Immigration into England began slowly with West Indians after the war as you say, but the last 15/20 years it has turned into a flood.  We feel it here more than the Germans as their country is twice the size of ours.  If Turkey joins the EU they will catch up big time.</p>
<p>Finally I am intrigued by your statement that the American Government &#8216;put very great pressure on Bonn&rsquo; to admit the Turks.  I always thought they were brought in to repair the massive amount of war damage and were tolerated because of this.  Did not realise America was &#8216;involved&rsquo;.</p>

<p> Sir, your country, the Republic of India, does allow Muslims to access Sharia courts if they so desire. Non Muslims dont have this right.<br>
 The Indian government also pays for Indian Muslims to make the pilgramage to Mecca [Haj]. Non Muslims dont recieve this subsidy.</p>

<p>This is a common misconception.  The &#8220;guest workers&#8221; came in the 60&rsquo;s long after all the damage from the war had been repaired and when West Germany was booming economically.  Foreign labor was brought in to artificially lower wages so that the rich wouldn&rsquo;t have to share their money with other whites.  It&rsquo;s the same motivation for the importation of black slaves, Asian coolies and now Mexicans into the USA.  The greed of the rich is our biggest enemy.  </p>
