<h1><a href="http://newsone.com/nation/associatedpress4/michele-bachmann-black-farmers-selletment/">Michele Bachmann Bashes the Black Farmer Settlement</a></h1>
 

<p>NewsOne, July 19, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann pointed to one program in particular Monday when talking about wasteful government spending: a multibillion dollar settlement paid to black farmers, who claim the federal government discriminated against them for decades in awarding loans and other aid.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two [Michele Bachmann and Rep. Steve King] responded by criticizing a 1999 settlement in what is known as the Pigford case, after the original plaintiff, North Carolina farmer Timothy Pigford. Late last year, President Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing a new, nearly $1.2 billion settlement for people who were denied payments in the earlier one because they missed deadlines for filing.</p>
<p>King has likened the Pigford settlement to &#8220;modern-day reparations&#8221; for African-Americans. He said Monday a large percentage of the settlement &#8220;was just paid out in fraudulent claims&#8221; and criticized the Obama administration&rsquo;s plan to resolve separate lawsuits filed by Hispanic and female farmers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bachmann seconded King&rsquo;s criticism, saying, &#8220;When money is diverted to inefficient projects, like the Pigford project, where there seems to be proof-positive of fraud, we can&rsquo;t afford $2 billion in potentially fraudulent claims when that money can be used to benefit the people along the Mississippi River and the Missouri River.&#8221;</p>
