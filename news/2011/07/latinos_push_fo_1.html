<h1>Latinos Push for Political Influence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Costantini and Susanna Capelouto, CNN, June 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Armed with fresh census data, Latinos around the country are flexing their political muscle. From state legislatures to Congress, the Hispanic vote is getting a voice.</p>
<p>Twelve million Hispanics are expected to vote in next year&rsquo;s elections, according to a survey the National Association of Latino Elected Officials released last week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>These findings come after census numbers show that Hispanics make up 16.3% of the U.S. population and are now the country&rsquo;s largest minority group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The battle over Latinos and new political maps also is playing out in Texas, which is gaining four new congressional seats. More than 37% of Texans are Latino.</p>
<p>And though they tend to lean Democratic, their preference is far from one-sided.</p>
<p>Mark Braden, a Republican attorney in Washington who advises the party on redistricting issues, says he&rsquo;s optimistic. He says he believes the GOP can make inroads with some Hispanic immigrant groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;Central Americans, I think, tend to be more socially conservative  &mdash;  traditional Catholics, large families, some people would say more entrepreneurial, and I think have been and likely to continue to be more Republican,&#8221; Braden says.</p>
<p>President George W. Bush got 40% of the Hispanic vote in his 2004 re-election bid. But in 2008, 67% of the Latino vote went to Barack Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are more than 50 million Hispanics in the United States, and the census shows that their continued influx and domestic birth rate accounts for more than half the nation&rsquo;s overall growth this past decade. It&rsquo;s a new reality all politicians will need to deal with come election time.</p>

		<p>All this article actually say is that more Hispanics are voting.  It doesn&rsquo;t say they are voting en bloc, though they probably are to some extent.  The headline is therefore sensationalizing things.</p>

		<p>Central Americans tend to enact street policies of demographic displacement.</p>
<p>Many Mestizos are aware that international corporations guided by our politicians are most likely to side with them over whites.</p>
<p>That is why Mestizos often prey on whites.</p>

		<p>The only way these brown invaders will flex their muscle will be murder, rapes, and other acts of terrorism and genocide against white Americans such as kidnapping and drug trafficking. Many of them are too illiterate to even read a ballot form.</p>

		<p>I have also read where Latinos will register to vote but never show up at the polls to vote. But then again, most of the illegals are Latino and they are not supposed to vote but how many of them actually do?</p>

		<p>The article states that there are more than 50 million Hispanics in the US. Does that figure include or exclude the ones here illegally? And I&rsquo;m sure they account for more than half this country&rsquo;s birth rate - but would they if their Section 8, EBT cards and free medical were denied? Doubt it. No wonder they won&rsquo;t go back to where they came from.</p>

		<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s true that Central and South Americans are more conservative, and Mexicans more liberal.  However, B.O. did not do for the Hispanics what he promised he&rsquo;d do (what a surprise), so many of the Hispanics are disillusioned with him and may vote for a different party/candidate.  I hope they turn more conservative, but it&rsquo;s way too early to tell.  I saw a news clip of an obviously ignorant older black woman at a B.O. rally prior to the 2008 election, and she was screaming, &#8220;Barack gonna gib me money!&#8221; over and over again.  Someone asked her where the money would come from, and she said, &#8220;Ah doan know and Ah doan keer - all Ah want is fo B.O. to gib me mah money!&#8221;  I believe the Hispanics had rather the same attitude toward B.O., but he did NOT &#8220;gib dem der money&#8221; - and is unlikely to in the future - so who knows how they&rsquo;ll vote in the next election!</p>

		<p>The leftist media never ceases to crow about the marginalization of whites in their own countries.  Unfortunately, we really don&rsquo;t know what the real status of our disposession is because the last cencus was rigged against whites.  White numbers were inflated because Middle Easterners and North African and Indians were all counted as white.  The only saving grace might be that a significant number of Hispanics are actually white.  We must never forget that Spain is a European country, and Spanish is a European language. Had the census been honest, there should have been choices for Middle Eastern, North African, Indian, mestizo, and mulatto. </p>

		<p>From what I understand, religion may influence the Latino vote. Those Hispanics that attend Pentecostal churches tend to be more conservative and vote the same way that the Religious right adherents do. The Catholic Hispanics may vote against abortion but tend to vote democractic on other issues.</p>

<p>What exactly does political influence mean? Latino leaders are pushing for control over the process for taxing whites so they can create lots of public benefits and make-work jobs for Mestizos. As with the blacks, this is their only path to the middle class.</p>

		<p>Hispanics in California tend to vote for socialism, but are vehemently against abortion and gay marriage. The black and hispanic vote passed a gay marriage ban in California. That stunned white liberals. They advocated their mass immigration, and they can&rsquo;t comprehend that minorities aren&rsquo;t actually liberal. They vote for socialism and displacement of whites&hellip;but machismo and religion prevent them from becoming true liberals.</p>
