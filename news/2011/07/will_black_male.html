<h1><a href="http://newsone.com/newsone-original/jothomas/bridging-the-balck-male-achievement-gap-with-programs/">Will Black Male Achievement Programs Help Bridge the Gap?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Johan Thomas, NewsOne, July 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Last week, the San Diego Unified School District unveiled its plan to bring Black students up to speed. Its course of action   &mdash;   a $3.5 million effort that incorporates college-preparation, parent workshops and centers, and faculty members that serve as liaisons for families of Black students.</p>
<p>The district&rsquo;s program is one of many springing up around the nation focusing on bridging the Black student achievement gap.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The disparity is quite evident in San Diego.  During the 2009-2010 school year Black students, who make up a mere 12 percent of the district&rsquo;s students, accounted for 21.5 percent of suspensions compared to white students who accounted for only four percent.</p>
<p>The numbers provide insight into similar statistics on California&rsquo;s and the nation&rsquo;s prison population. Blacks make up about 7 percent of California&rsquo;s population, and make up 32 percent of its prison inmates. Nationally, Blacks account for about 13 percent of the population and nearly 40 percent of those incarcerated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics say these programs are not only ineffective, but that the achievement gap is a myth diverting funds in a racially exclusive way from other students who could use the same support.</p>
<p>The Council For Greater Schools is a leading advocate on bridging the gap. It&rsquo;s latest report &#8220;A Call For Change: The Social and Educational Factors Contributing to the Outcomes of Black Males in Urban Schools,&#8221; is a thorough examination of the crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black males continue to perform lower than their peers throughout the country on almost every indicator,&#8221; the report reads, outlining a host of factors that contribute to the disparity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The data shows the lack of opportunity starts from the earliest years. Black males are more likely to grow up in poverty, raised in homes where fathers are absent or unemployed, and mothers detached or chronically depressed.</p>
<p>According to the CGCS, Black children are three times more likely than white children to live in single-parent homes. They are twice as likely as their white peers to live in homes where no parent has a full-time or year-round job. And only a third of Black children grow up in homes where a parent has a high school diploma.</p>
<p>Iheoma Iruka, Researcher at The Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute at the University of NorthCarolina, evaluates the disparities in Black boys as they emerge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s hard to assess kids in their early years, but as early as 24 months, a gap in cognitive development begins to emerge,&#8221; she said. This means that by the time Black boys reach the age of two, they are already behind white males of the same age when it comes to things like responding to orders and language development.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics say it is reasonable to accept the different outcomes across ethnicity  &mdash;  for as far as they are concerned  &mdash;  the correlation between race and achievement has more to do with genetics than socioeconomic factors. It&rsquo;s an argument that has long existed in American society, used to justify colonialism and slavery. The idea gained steam ever since IQ testing became popular early in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Historically, Blacks score lower on IQ tests than whites. {snip}</p>
<p>If critics are correct, this would mean programs to boost Black male performance in schools are fighting a losing battle and draining districts of money and resources that can better serve the entire student populous.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At any rate, no one is denying that the effort is a mighty task. In San Diego, $3.5 million may not be enough to significantly improve the gap between the 33 percent of African-American students who scored proficient or better on state math tests, compared with 64 percent of white students and 69 percent of Asians.</p>

<p>This is a very good piece of evidence that Rushton&rsquo;s contention that black children are cognitively ahead of white children during the Pre-K &#8220;Head Start&#8221; years is incorrect, even though in terms of non-mental physical development, they may be.  Since this research came out of a university we&rsquo;ve all heard of, and the institute is probably liberal-run, that only makes the finding of racial differences even more credible.</p>

		<p>For an MSM platform, this report is a remarkably candid discussion of potential reasons for racial differences in cognitive performance for an MSM platform.  I hope the reporter and his editor do not pay a the usual terrible price for presenting as a plausible option for &#8220;criticts&#8221; that the &#8220;gap&#8221; has &#8220;more to do with genetics than socioeconomic factors.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Just what is the achievement gap in the context of K-12 schooling?  The most succinct definition was furnished by Education Trust:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Education Trust, &ldquo;Closing the Achievement Gap,&rdquo; National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>
http://tinyurl.com/2d6sayq</p>
<p>Note the conditional &ldquo;if they do so [reach 12th grade] at all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Those words means that the black-white achievement gap is &ldquo;four years&rdquo; for the above-average contingent of black students still in school by 12th grade. The below-average contingent of black students (half of the age cohort) have already dropped out. </p>

<p>Huh? The concept of genetics only became known in the 20th century - after slavery and most colonialism had ended.</p>

It&rsquo;d be nice if we could give blacks the intelligence boost they need with a special IQ-zapper enema, but that isn&rsquo;t going to happen either!  They flat aren&rsquo;t going to get it, folks; it&rsquo;d be kinder to just relegate these people to areas where they CAN succeed instead of trying to force them to achieve in areas where they don&rsquo;t have a chance.</p>

		<p>For an article from NewsOne, a website centered around Black interests, I was surprised that the article even mentioned the possibility of a genetic deficit in Blacks. And not only did they mention it, they actually speculated what it would mean for Blacks. This is far fairer reporting than I&rsquo;ve ever seen from mainstream news sources. Then again, the only ones allowed to speak frankly about Black problems are Blacks themselves. </p>

		<p>Data from the Department of Energy and other agencies suggest that those technically poor in the US have no shortage of appliances.  Thus, to say that many black males grow up &#8220;in poverty&#8221; [Mr. Thomas&rsquo; words] may miss the point.  It would be more correct to say they grow up &#8220;impoverished,&#8221; which is an important difference.  The culture wide impoverishment of young black males cannot be made the fault of whites.</p>

		<p>Good God, how many times do we have to launch these initiatives in the face of what everyone knows:  Blacks are the least intelligent of all major races, there are no instances of black political, economic, social, of industrial success.  Anywhere, not now or in the past.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that they can&rsquo;t contribute to a society, but it does mean that they won&rsquo;t be represented among the upper strata in accomplishment, wealth accumulation, social development, or living standards.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not an &#8220;IQ fundamentalist&#8221;, i.e. I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s of such an importance it is almost consensually being thought of. One of the best 20th century physicists, Richard Feynman, has had IQ measured to be 125 (which is above average, but nothing spectacular &amp; completely incommensurable with his achievements). More, the great French mathematician, Henri Poincare, one of the 10-15 greatest mathematicians in history &amp; last, along with Gottingen-based German David Hilbert, mathematical universalist - got IQ somewhere around 100, maybe below, due to peculiarities of his intellect. I mean- IQ is not negligible, but also not *the* indicator of one&rsquo;s achievement. <br>
As for blacks, they seem to be, all around globe, from the US, the Caribbean, Brazil, Africa&hellip;.simply not possessing traits leading to any kind of mental achievement- drive, motivation, fascination with the relatively abstract subject, passion for discovery, continual hard mental work. Even their best literature - I&rsquo;ve read novels of James Baldwin, Ralph Ellison, &hellip;poetry of Aime Cesaire, L. Sedar Senghor- cannot compare with the stuff written by their white peers. Genes and culture, I don&rsquo;t know which takes precedence, but the combination is, without question- paralyzing.  </p>

<p>They need to remove the irrelevant words &#8220;in poverty&#8221;, which only distract from the issue.  It isn&rsquo;t a matter of nature vs nurture, it&rsquo;s BOTH.  There is a almost certainly a genetic difference, and the parental and peer quality does the rest.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s even generous to say that black 17-year-olds are comparable with white 13-year-olds, from a cognitive standpoint.  I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s more like white 10-year-olds.<br>

		<p>Will Black Male Achievement Programs Help Bridge the Gap?</p>
<p>THE ANSWER IS NO!<br>
blacks have no desire to be like whites or to live like them.<br>
blacks should have been left alone to live the jungle style life they seem to crave.<br>
When I hear black adult males speaking in that ebo jibberish and dressed like a naughty 12 year old with his pants hanging below his buttocks, I know these people Were Never and Will Never mix with ANY civilized race on the planet.<br>

<p>So why is this OUR problem? Wheres all those &#8220;strong black men&#8221; that went to the &#8220;Million thug - oops - Man March&#8221; back in &#8216;95 and promised to clean up their &#8220;communities&#8221;? In the SIXTEEN YEARS since that march, their communities should&rsquo;ve been Mayberry by now. As usual all that blacks seem to be able to run is their mouths. Always all talk and no results - ALWAYS! Whatever results they do make is because of Whites. You&rsquo;ll notice that blacks are ONLY successful in White countries. Why is that? Throw THAT in you liberal friends face and dare them to prove you wrong.  <br>

<p>At this point is it important to know how much of the gap is genetic vs. environmental?</p>
<p>If the gap were going to close, it would&rsquo;ve done so by now after billions spent on uplift programs, preferential admissions to college and countless conferences.</p>
<p>The same holds true for our problems with Latinos: Long after the usual 3 generations to assimilation they&rsquo;re a disaster and there is no reason to believe it will suddenly reverse course.</p>

		<p>So, here we have again the old saw about Europeans and white Americans making up a myth about black inferiority to justify colonialism and slavery.  Realization of black intellectual deficiency occurred when Arabs traveled into Africa and brought back slaves.  Until the latter half of the twentieth century, no one was trying to push the idea that blacks are mental equals of whites.  People realized for centuries that mulattoes were often smarter than pure blacks, but every culture in the world recognized that blacks were below whites, Asians, and Native Americans in learning ability.  <br>
As federal money peters out, the only thing left to do will be to shuttle the majority of blacks off into their own school districts, with their own black teachers and administrators, and their own curricula and testing.  </p>

		<p>They keep comparing whites to blacks in order to keep the white whipping boy front and center, tacitly implying that black incompetence is somehow the fault of whites even in areas like this one where whites are a minority.</p>
<p>Where is the comparison between blacks and Hispanics?  Blacks and Asians?  Blacks are behind them also, but the only comparisons we are ever shown is between blacks and whites.</p>
<p>Of course the reason for this is because the media, academia and the left, don&rsquo;t want to shift attention away from their continuing demonization and intimidation of whites, nor do they want to stress the fact that blacks are behind everybody.</p>

<p>Where is Rushton&rsquo;s contention that black children are cognitively ahead of white children during the Pre-K &#8220;Head Start&#8221; years?  I have come across no evidence of Rushton having ever made this claim.</p>
<p>However, <b>Rushton</b> and Jensen write in  <i>Thirty Years of Research on Race Difference in Cognitive Ability</i> (2005)  http://goo.gl/cvmtF:</p>
<p><i>Racial-group differences in IQ appear early. For example, the Black and the<br>
White 3-year-old children in the standardization sample of the Stanford–Binet IV<br>
show a 1 standard deviation mean difference after being matched on gender, birth<br>
order, and maternal education. Similarly,   Black and the White 21⁄2- to 6-year-old children in the U.S. standardization sample of the Differential Aptitude Scale have a 1 standard deviation mean difference.</i> </p>
<p><i>The size of the average Black–White difference does not change significantly over the developmental period from 3 years of age and beyond.</i></p>
<p>Hope that clears up any misunderstandings.<br>

		<p>Hey, wait a minute&hellip; bussing back in the 1970s was supposed to fix them.  What happened?</p>
<p>I remember when they started busing to my school.  Went from great to good lord in a few short years!  All the whites moved out to escape bussing and today that entire neighborhood is a disaster. There have been dozens of cures since busing.  </p>
<p>So, now we have &#8220;cure 2012&#8221; for the black folks to get fixed so they can be like whites.  I am sure this one will work!  Something has to work, they can&rsquo;t milk that slavery cow forever&hellip; or can they?. </p>

		<p>One dainty fact of contemporary science is that both Whites and Blacks would benefit significantly, but not dramatically, by<br>
gender segregation shortly before the (racially varied ) onset of puberty and throughout most of the high school years.  The<br>
advantage would probably be greatest to the achievement of Black<br>
males.  The lust-laden sexual hedonism of the larger society wreaks a lot of havoc and especially upon Black males in early<br>
adolescence.  </p>

		<p>In the early 90&rsquo;s some promising studies were carried out <br>
showing that nutritional supplementation could boost IQ quite<br>
a bit for certain individuals and overall could boost IQ<br>
significantly in controlled group studies.  However, it appears<br>
efforts at replication have taken the wind out of these sails.<br>
The fact remains, however, that apparently the supplementation<br>
did impressively boost the intellectual performance of some individuals  &mdash;  what incidence? 01 out of 10? 01 out of 15?  &mdash;  by several IQ points.  I am puzzled as to why efforts were not made to follow up each individual case of significant improvement with anecdotal studies just to try to ferret out who can be helped quite a bit even if most can&rsquo;t be.There seems to be a disdain for anecdotal evidence and a total commitment to group studies. The major impetus for these studies in the early 90&rsquo;s was the late and great Dr. Hans Eysenck  &mdash;  mentor to such figures as Art Jensen,Phil Rushton, Chris Brand, and so many others.  Prof. Rushton has attempted further work in this field.  </p>

		<p>The impoverishment of black males was defitely caused by do good whites and by black leaders who expected special treatment because of past mistakes. I saw the same crap going on in India a few decades prior to its starting over here. Teach a man to fish and all of that. Does anyone really give a damn? The best and the brighest adventurese whites came here first followed by the enslaved bottom of the rung blacks, as they say in animal breeding, difference in genetic stock. Genetically that is where the inborn difference starts from. The brighter black women are not producing while the lower IQ blacks are. Go figure.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Black students, who make up a mere 12 percent of the district&rsquo;s students, accounted for 21.5 percent of suspensions compared to white students who accounted for only four percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>If whites and blacks together are 25.5% of suspensions then who makes up the other 74.5%? Hispanics? If so, where are the stats on them? They may be better or worse than the blacks, but shouldn&rsquo;t we see? There&rsquo;s enough of a gap in these figures that some other group may be doing much worse than black males but no one&rsquo;s suggesting a multi-million dollar program for them.</p>

IQ Scores of Blacks and Whites Regress toward the Averages of Their Race. Parents pass on only some exceptional genes to offspring so parents with very high IQs tend to have more average children. Black and White children with parents of IQ 115 move to different averages  &mdash;  Blacks toward 85 and Whites to 100.<br>

		<p>Uptown makes an interesting point, the distinction between material poverty and mental impoverishment.</p>
<p>US blacks have access to material wealth, medical care, schooling, housing, gadgetry, appliances, telephones, etc., that would have left white Americans who grew up in the 20s and 30s staggered.</p>
<p>What did a school room look like in a middle-class white American community in 1875? No computers, electricity, no gadgets, but students still managed to learn foreign languages, history, science, and math.</p>
<p>We have allowed ourselves to become distracted by the sideshow of black academic failure (a permanent and unchangeable condition) instead of paying attention to white academic failure, which is eminently reversible. </p>
<p>It is cruel and stupid to expect blacks to perform at white levels, they should not be allowed to drop out of school. </p>
<p>Everyone - of all races - should be tracked, according to mental ability into programs designed for their level. </p>
<p>This is the European system and it is quite sensible (although it too has been deformed by political correctness, so that far too many people are attending university, wasting years fiddling with ideas above their heads instead of learning practical trades).</p>
<p>Instead, once they have stopped absorbing knowledge, they should be given simple training and placed in jobs they can perform. </p>
<p>For many blacks, and a few whites, this will happen around age 12 or 13. A job would give them income, keep them off the streets, spare them the excruciating boredom and frustration of trying to learn, and allow them to help their families.</p>
<p>White academic failure is a bit trickier, because it reflects a collapse of values, a loss of purpose, and an absence of pride in our own civilization and its achievements.</p>

		<p>China at work on finding the IQ genes. And then what?<br>
Although gene sequencing was born in America, and indeed Houston played a seminal role in its development, the future may be in China.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the large Asian country is positioning itself to be the leader in the field of genomics.</p>
<p><br>
The llumina HiSeq 2000 can output data up to 200 G/run. (BGI)<br>
As seen in some science fiction movies, like Gattaca, genetics could become a powerful tool to control societies when fully realized.</p>
<p>With that in mind, consider this recent article in the South China Morning Post, tranlated by physicist Steve Hsu:</p>
<p>Some of the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputers are being set up in Hong Kong to address the age-old mystery of human intelligence.</p>
<p>The study of intelligence quotient (IQ) is being conducted by BGI Hong Kong, [formerly] known as the Beijing Genomics Institute. It will survey DNA samples from 1,000 child prodigies from China&rsquo;s best high schools, comparing them with samples from 1,000 children of average intelligence, searching for genetic variations.</p>
<p>The study will examine protein coding genes of the extremely smart children, many of whom are expected to enroll at Harvard, Yale or Cambridge. The results will be correlated with each youngster&rsquo;s school test scores, in hopes of learning how specific genetic variations affect intelligence.</p>
<p>The study, which started in 2009 in Shenzhen, is moving to a new facility in Tai Po. By the end of this month, 115 of the world&rsquo;s fastest sequencers – the HiSeq 2000 – will have relocated to the city. They will be able to sequence the equivalent of 1,000 human genomes a day, and soon surpass the entire sequencing output of the United States to become the world&rsquo;s largest sequencing centre.</p>
<p>The study by BGI, which receives strong financial backing from the Shenzhen and mainland governments, will be the largest-scale examination of its kind. Ethical and privacy concerns have hindered such work in America and Europe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting study precisely because studies linking IQs to specific genes has largely been taboo in the United States.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how far along China is with this work, nor what the intent of the project really is. But one can easily speculate how it might be used.</p>
<p>So have at it.</p>

<p>I think it would be better to relegate them back to the continent from which their ancestors originated. They&rsquo;ll always be a burden on society. While doing things in which they can achieve, they&rsquo;ll still be out there raping, assaulting, murdering and blaming White people for THEIR genetic deficiencies.<br>
It just isn&rsquo;t going to work. The seventy year experiment has failed. Even in Communist countries where there is a Black component you don&rsquo;t see many if any Blacks in important positions in the government; the exception being SA &amp; Zim where government is in  total disarray while they exterminate the last of the White people who made SA &amp; Rhodesia the bread basket of the African continent.<br>
This genocide will escalate and the blood of these people will be on the hands of the West who looked the other way. The British PM returned from a visit to SA due to the Murdoch scandal, He was there for some trade talks. How can he sit at a conference table with these mass murderers while as he speaks, Boer and Brit farm families are being raped and murdered?  The US and Europe import thousands of people from countries that despise us and these people contribute to the already high rate of criminal violence but we ignore the plight of the White S, Africans who have skills that could contribute to the society. Why? Because they&rsquo;re White. Our leaders can&rsquo;t openly exterminate the indigenous White population quite yet . They leave that to the Black underclass that they&rsquo;ve created.</p>

		<p><i>It would be more correct to say they grow up &ldquo;impoverished,&rdquo; which is an important difference.</i></p>
<p>Yes, and I would also say they grow up depraved and amoral as well.</p>
<p>You would be <i>shocked</i> at the material possessions these poor &#8220;students&#8221; have   &mdash;   Dr. Dre headphones (the $299 version!), the latest 4G smart phones with full internet access,  $250 iPods, the latest $250 basketball shoes   &mdash;   and these are just the things they bring to school!</p>
<p>This as they are dropped off at school, usually tardy,  in large, gas-guzzling, late-model Cadillac or Lincoln SUVs  &mdash;  just in time for the free breakfast that the government says they&rsquo;re entitled to!</p>
<p>I frequently attend teachers&rsquo; meetings in the midst of one of the most violent, degenerate housing projects in LA   &mdash;    one with late model cars parked behind security gates in the Section 8-only parking lot and each unit featuring its own satellite dish on top.  Heat wave?  Don&rsquo;t think these units are fully air conditioned   &mdash;   it would be &#8220;racist&#8221; if they weren&rsquo;t.  City workers are always there cutting the grass, trimming the trees, re-paving the streets, painting the units   &mdash;    while sections of &#8220;wealthy&#8221; LA wait 40 years for the street pavers to come by.</p>
<p>Newer Section 8 housing in LA consists of 24-hour, guard-gated developments with swimming pools, child care centers and outdoor play areas (&#8220;study centers&#8221; for the older miscreants   &mdash;   complete with computers sporting the latest high speed Internet connections), basketball courts staffed by coaches, frequent field trips to local amusement parks, free meals for everyone, full support services like tutoring, mental health care, legal aid, social workers, job support services   &mdash;   all of it free, of course, <i>for them</i>, not for you!  </p>
<p>I should know, I work near one of these &#8220;blighted ghettos&#8221; where the &#8220;poor are forced to live.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, every once in a while you may have to dodge a bullet or two but other than that, it&rsquo;s not a bad life!  Keep the benefits rolling! Or&hellip;??</p>
<p>This is why I believe when the EBT cards stop working, services are cut off, the entire system crashes in upon itself, when the government has &#8220;run out of other people&rsquo;s money&#8221; as is fast happening in California and elsewhere and massive, seething numbers of welfare parasites are left high and dry   &mdash;   there will be unspeakable violence, and lots of   &mdash;    directed at Whites, who are being systematically dehumanized and scapegoated by the educational system and media as responsible for ALL poverty.  They got rich on the backs of the poor, don&rsquo;t you know!</p>
<p>In fact, this seems to already be happening across the country as I read (on the Internet, not in the newspapers) about flash mobs, riots and increasing numbers of attacks on lone Whites   &mdash;   with blacks cheering the attackers on.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think Hispanics won&rsquo;t become violent when their benefits are cut off!  Ha! They believe Whites are living on land stolen from them, that everything we Whites have rightfully belongs to them.  </p>

		<p>I think Bon&rsquo;s comments are &#8220;on the money.&#8221; I live in New York and more and more random violence is going on, mostly blacks against whites. The subways are like &#8220;jungle paths&#8221; in some cases. (I tend to like the 7 line because it goes through mostly Hispanic and Asian neighborhoods with a low percentage of blacks riding on it.)</p>
<p>I agree that when the economic collapse comes for the United States, as I&rsquo;m sure it will since we&rsquo;re not much different than Greece in the final analysis, that the black on white violence will get more and more out of control. On the other hand, I think the reaction of the Hispanic poor will be less exteme, even though I understand that following the Rodney King verdict in the early 1990&rsquo;s there were plenty of rioting Hispanics taking advanting of the opportunites for looting.</p>

<p>I do know that the left once touted Head Start as a great academic success, because it supposedly showed black Pre-K students doing well.  Until very recently, I though it was purely a function of Head Start being applied to black children at the rare ages when they are about on par or maybe a bit ahead of white children of the same age in terms of brain development.  Now that we know that whites &gt; blacks at all ages, that can&rsquo;t be true.  Perhaps there was some Atlanta-style cheating going on.  Perhaps head start administrators and teachers and instructors fibbed on their progress reports, which is not beyond the realm of possibility   &mdash;   After all, whoever heard of a recipient of Federal funds lying to keep the Federal funds flowing their way?</p>

<p>Just happened to catch a documentary on Lincoln the other night, while surfing.  Lincoln&rsquo;s intention was to compensate the owners in the South for their slaves and then return them to Africa (Liberia)and/or a colony in Brazil.  But because the South was just about to defeat the Union in 1862, he had to change his tune to satisfy the Abolitionist Movement&rsquo;s call for emancipation.  The moral tone and sound of immediacy won him over to the more politically expedient idea.  Of course, most of us here know this, but I found it interesting that this more cynical view of Lincoln was being presented on PBS.</p>
<p>I find this ironic, that the South fired the first shot, (egged on of course), and the fact of their martial skill determined the future of an America tormented and likely ultimately destroyed by blacks and the resulting politics they caused.  How would it have been if the South had taken Lincoln&rsquo;s Olive Branch and settled without so much military involvement?  If we are honest, we know that they South was itching for a fight, a chance to humiliate the North.  And the North resented those &#8220;Southern Gentlemen.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I believe it goes all the way back to the English Civil War.  The Nobles settled in Virginia and the hard-headed, bleak,Puritans and the type settled in the North.  Their cultures became generalized.  Slavery was just an excuse to have another fight.  We must stop this white on white hatred!</p>
<p>Sorry for digressing a bit here.</p>

		<p>The interest in IQ testing in China became manifest in deeds in<br>
the early 80&rsquo;s and resulted in the standardization of the Raven<br>
Progressive Matrices under the direction of the Vice President of the Chinese Psychological Society.  The reversals in China at the end of that decade probably put some damper on things.  However, the work of Arthur Jensen received heavy endorsement<br>
in terms of the empahsis upon &#8220;g&#8221; factor, and his STRAIGHT TALK\<br>
ABOUT MENTAL TESTS was translated ( China was not then bound by international copyright restraints ), at least in many photocopy editions.  Some cognizance of this awakening, not perhaps mentioning these specific instances, was given in MANKIND QUARTERLY.  The Chinese in the awakening of the 80&rsquo;s had a keen,if largely unwhispered, appreciation of the planned obsolesence that has been the favorite indoor $port of the American test publshing biz, leading firms of which have a profit margin that with less hyperbole than the expression suggets, &#8220;would be the envy of every Latin American  cocaine cartel&#8221;  If more choice reaction time studies and Inspection Time studies could be made of the maturational stages of adequate samples of Black and White children, we&rsquo;d have less quibble fodder.  It will be interesting if the Chinese &#8220;leap frog&#8221; the USA in matters of scientific applications in mental ability assessment and in the biological aspects of individual differences and group overlapping differences along dimensions of social class, race, and gender.  I&rsquo;d bet heavily they will, if they are already not in fact doing so. An obvious underlying issue that cries out for treatment by political scientists and sociologists is why why nations professedly embracing Marxism for decades denied, denied, denied the scientific merits and practical efficay of mental tests.  Apparently again and again in the former USSR the issue of IQ tests and of biological underpinnings to troubling group overlapping differences came up within the scientific recesses  of the CP USSR only to be stepped upon over and over  &mdash;  this well after the 1935 official written ban (there was, incidentally, no official ban on IQ tests in the misguided German anti-Marxian fanatical counterrevolution of 1933 ff.)  The most haunting aspect of the tragedy of Black underattainment is that a tough-minded confrontation of the possibility of biological-evolutionary  underpinnings could likely produce realistic mitigation of this gap.  Denial of reality has exacerbated it.  Chris Brand in his depublished book THE &#8220;G&#8221; FACTOR and in interviews attendant to the book,  dealt directly with concepts like an ungraded, seamless smorgasbord of curriculum along which students would interface at their level of attainment.  He also mentioned apropos the time, the possibility of nutritional supplementation and of Black sexual eugenics.  His book survives in a fragile way in being accessible free online, so that these realistic mitigation factors can be witnessed in actual print, and if someone is incredulous that such commentary has ever been printed, bet them a pitcher of beer about it and then lead them to the print, they cold sober.  <br>

		<p>Reply to #46:</p>
<p>The south was not about to defeat the union in 1862. There were no southern armies in the north. No northern city had fallen to the south or was being besieged by them. No northern seaport had been captured by the confederate navy. In fact the reverse was true. Lincoln&rsquo;s motivation was to turn the CSA into an international pariah and forestall European recognition.</p>

		<p>Apropos Post #49/#30.  The Vice-President of the Chinese Psychological Society in the mid-80&rsquo;s expressed high regard for the work of Hans Eysenck and the London School. She had met Dr. Eysenck at an international conference.  After learning of her<br>
praise for the primer value of Prof. Arthur Jensen&rsquo;s STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT MENTAL TESTS, for helping build a Chinese approach to psychology,  Dr. Eysenck agreed to send her in quantities of six<br>
(six packs! ) many of his major books  &mdash;   each of what he sent went to one of six satellite university programs within China working to lay the groundwork of a PRC approach to psychological science.  Among the books received was THE INEQUALITY OF MAN.  The Chinese have the good sense  &mdash;  perhaps inspired by the quiet analysis of the weaknesses of psychology as it has burgeoned in the USA?  &mdash;  to assume that realism is the basis for decent and sustainable social policies.  </p>

They all but admit the differences are genetic, yet let&rsquo;s throw more money at it?<br>

		<p>&#8220;The data shows the lack of opportunity starts from the earliest years. Black males are more likely to grow up in poverty, raised in homes where fathers are absent or unemployed, and mothers detached or chronically depressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Absolute hogwash.</p>
<p>My best childhood friend had two sisters and their father died when he was 8. In those days there wasn&rsquo;t all this guvment booty floating around. They were as poor as one could be and not actually be dead from starvation.</p>
<p>We were in not very good shape either, but my mother had them over for dinner and holidays as much as we possibly could to help without insulting them and she would leave anonymous packages for them.</p>
<p>We had lots of fruit trees and my mother would can preserves and have me help deliver baskets at 3 in the morning so they would never know who did it.<br>
My friend ran two paper routes all year, the mother worked at a church to pay for their tuition.</p>
<p>Later in their life she got cancer and worked even harder while ignoring her condition so she would not bankrupt the family. If dying of cancer isn&rsquo;t depressing I can&rsquo;t imagine what is.</p>
<p>I never met a tougher human being in my life than his mother and having served and been around a lot of tough special ops guys that is saying quite a bit.</p>
<p>The upshot is all the kids turned out okay and are reasonably successful and now enjoy a life that they could only have dreamed about as children.</p>
<p>Her cancer went into remission on it&rsquo;s own, she was simply too strong for it and beat it to death. She died in her late nineties and was the closest I&rsquo;ll ever get to a saint.</p>
<p>Not once did this woman dying of cancer ever ask for help and when we dropped off food and baskets etc she was the first one to turn around and donate half of it at church to help those that she said &#8220;Didn&rsquo;t have it as good as she did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guvment booty won&rsquo;t help.</p>
