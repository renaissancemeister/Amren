			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Orange, Telegraph (London), July 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mukhtar Ablyazov fled Kazakhstan in 2009 as BTA Bank, the bank that he chaired, was nationalised. He rented a house in The Bishop&rsquo;s Avenue, the Hampstead street known as Billionaire&rsquo;s Row.</p>
<p>The bank is now pursuing claims against him totalling £2.4bn in one of the biggest fraud cases ever heard at the London High Court.</p>
<p>Mr Ablyazov on Tuesday received official documentation from the Home Office informing him that his application for asylum had been successful, confirming unofficial information received last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;On 7 July 2011 the UK Home Office confirmed that Mr Ablyazov will be granted Refugee Status and that his wife and children have been permitted to remain in the UK,&#8221; a press statement from Mr Ablyazov read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Ablyazov&rsquo;s application for political asylum was based on the fact that if he were to return to Kazakhstan he would be persecuted because of his political opinions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision is certain to enrage Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose law authorities called again this year for Mr Ablyazov to be extradited to face organised crime charges.</p>
<p>Mr Ablyazov says he is being persecuted for his political opposition to Mr Nazarbayev, who has ruled the oil-rich republic with an iron fist since the dying days of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>He claims that the fraud has been fabricated by the Kazakh authorities to discredit him and justify what he describes as the &#8220;forced nationalisation&#8221; of his bank.</p>
<p>Mr Ablyazov was jailed for a year in 2002 after co-founding Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan, an opposition pro-business party, with other senior businessmen and bureaucrats, fleeing to exile in Moscow on his release in 2003.</p>
<p>He returned to Kazakhstan in 2005 after promising to limit his activities to business.</p>
<p>But BTA Bank was badly hit when the financial crisis struck in 2008 and Mr Ablyazov fled the country shortly before the Kazakh government took majority control in March 2009.</p>
<p>The bank&rsquo;s new management claims that Mr Ablyazov siphoned off billions of the bank&rsquo;s assets though a series of fake transactions in the years prior to his departure.</p>
<p>The London High Court in December put Mr Ablyazov&rsquo;s assets into receivership after he sold assets in breach of a freezing order. It has also chided him for failing to fully disclose his assets.</p>
<p>Mr Ablyazov has sought to destabilise the country from exile, issuing a steady stream of statements in support of the oil workers&rsquo; strikes that have been raging in the country&rsquo;s West since May.</p>
<p>When Sting the British singer pulled out of a concert in Astana in protest at the workers&rsquo; treatment, Askar Balzhanov, the chief executive of strike-hit oil company KMG EP hinted that Ablyazov was behind the move.</p>
<p>Last month Ablyazov issued a statement calling for Mr Nazarbayev to step aside and make way for a parliamentary republic.</p>
<p>Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC were among the banks that last year agreed to write off a combined $6.8bn (£4.3bn) in loans to BTA.</p>
<p>The banks stand to receive back up to 50 per cent of any funds BTA Bank recovers from Mr Ablyazov in the High Court.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s basically the pro-Muslim multiculty elites in London paying back one of their biggest would-be-puppets after he failed to oust the pro-Putin president and instigate a scenario like in the Middle East. </p>

		<p>The British should at least demand 50% of that fortune for asylum.</p>
<p>The British have to pay for so many asylum seekers already. Isn&rsquo;t it fair to make the rich ones pay their fair share?</p>
<p>(Note: I don&rsquo;t know if he is really wanted for bank-fraud or if it&rsquo;s political as I don&rsquo;t really trust either side so I withhold judgement on the validity and wisdom of the decision in the first place.)</p>

		<p>OK, so now all you have to do is commit a crime in another country and then go to the UK and escape punishment and they&rsquo;ll take you in? When one of us do that, it&rsquo;s called &#8220;harboring a fugitive&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The UK shelters so many ex-dictators, crooks and financial scam artists.  Can anyone explain why this is?  The government seems to want the Mukhtar Ablyazovs of this world to all settle in their country.  </p>
