<h1>Rodney King Out on Bail After DUI Arrest</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chicago Tribune, July 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rodney King has been released on bail after being arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 46-year-old was reportedly driving a 1994 Mitsubishi when officers observed him committing &#8220;multiple infractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>King, who lives in Rialto, was taken into custody and was eventually arrested and booked on suspicion of driving under the influence at the Robert Presley Detention Center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 1991, King became a symbol of police brutality after being beaten by four LAPD officers after a police chase through the San Fernando Valley.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The video caused outrage across Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Four officers involved in the incident were tried and acquitted, sparking the Los Angeles riots of 1992 which lasted four days and left 55 people dead.</p>
<p>Two of them were later charged with violating King&rsquo;s federal civil rights and served time in prison.</p>
<p>King has not been a stranger to law enforcement or substance abuse in the years since the incident.</p>
<p>In May 1991, he was arrested on suspicion of trying to run over a vice officer who allegedly found him with a transvestite prostitute in Hollywood, but no charges were filed.</p>
<p>In 1992, King was arrested for DUI, but again no charges were filed.</p>
<p>In 1993, King entered an alcohol rehabilitation program and was placed on probation after crashing his vehicle into a block wall in downtown Los Angeles with a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit.</p>
<p>He was arrested for DUI again in May 1995 in Pennsylvania. He was tried and acquitted.</p>
<p>In July 1995, he was arrested by Alhambra police, who alleged that he hit his wife with his car, knocking her to the ground.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In, September 2001 King was arrested in Claremont and charged with being under the influence of the psychedelic drug PCP.</p>
<p>He was also arrested in 2005 after he allegedly threatening his daughter and ex-girlfriend.</p>

		<p>Rodney King again, huh?  Oh yeah, he was the hapless black victim of LA police brutality when it took something like five LA officers to subdue this 280 pound stoned and out-of-control African thug who said touchingly into the camera, &#8220;Why can&rsquo;t we all jus&rsquo; get along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Great question, Rodney!  All we white folks just love being mugged, robbed, and having our neighborhoods trashed by you and your African fellow citizens. Why can&rsquo;t we learn to enjoy this?</p>

		<p>Rodney King is still alive?  That&rsquo;s very surprising. Usually, blacks given a large lump sum of money, don&rsquo;t live very long.</p>

		<p>Rodney Glenn! I am actually surprised that Rodney Glenn is still alive and well. Thought by now that he might have killed in some sort of dispute with a fellow black over a parking space, a cigarette, a quarter, etc. The typical type of argument that the Bantu get into over a minor triviality that quickly becomes &#8220;heated&#8221; and soon one is dead. A situation, an exchange of &#8220;words&#8221; and then guns or knives drawn and bingo, one less Rodney Glenn!</p>
<p>HEY, whatever happened to that $3 million Rodney Glenn got as his settlement for trying to kill the cops after doing the Folsom Roll? THE FOLSOM ROLL: http://www.actionfightingarts.com/newsletter5.htm</p>

		<p>Did anyone else notice that Rodney seems to have had absolutely no desire to resist arrest ever since those four L.A. officers gave him that roadside counselling that he was crying out for?</p>

		<p>&#8220;King has not been a stranger to law enforcement and substance abuse since the incident&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually King has NEVER been a stranger to either. He had a substantial criminal record BEFORE the incident and hasn&rsquo;t done a very good job of staying out of trouble since despite receiving millions in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Also it is most unlikely he was caught every single time he drove under the influence. He&rsquo;s probably done it many more times but didn&rsquo;t get caught.</p>

		<p>He was given nearly $4 million as a settlement, but he&rsquo;s driving a 1994 Mitsubishi and living in the ghetto in Rialto?  Sounds like someone went broke again!  It would be interesting to know how he spent his windfall&hellip;  </p>

		<p> While I don&rsquo;t excuse his excessive beating, Rodney King was a habitual criminal who was resisting arrest after a 100 mile an hour car chase by police. Mr. King has evidently continued his personal crime wave after being awarded millions for pain and suffering brought on by the police beating.

<p>Well&hellip;the misunderstood one is living in Rialto and driving a 1994 Mitsubishi. Apparently however, he still has money for drugs, booze and gas. Since he&rsquo;s such a law abiding citizen, I&rsquo;m sure he had proper insurance and registration as well.  </p>
<p>I think this is what this guy does for a living. Continuing to operate a vehicle while high and drunk, yearning no doubt to recapture that long ago day when resisting arrest and endangering the lives of others would in a million dollar pay day. <br>
So far, he has been unable to duplicate such a pay day. But based his rap sheet, clearly, it&rsquo;s not from any lack of effort on his part.</p>

		<p>AGAIN, Rodney?  Sheesh.  Every time I turn around, this dude is drunk and arrested again.  Does the judge ever send him to AA?  A sentence of 4 meetings per week for a year might do what years of court battles haven&rsquo;t.  I think this guy is probably just rum-dumb by now; alcohol kills brain cells over time, and you can bet that Rodney hasn&rsquo;t had that many sober hours over the years.</p>

		<p>With the (in my opinion ill-gotten) financial settlement he obtained, King should have been more then comfortably set for life. He seems to have squandered the money. To the extent he &#8220;invested&#8221; it, he put it into a rap company/singer or some such nonsense. One common denominator I have noticed among blacks is they seem to have no money sense at all and spend their money on the most ridiculous things. </p>

		<p>Somebody should fix Rodney King up with Crystal Gayle Mangum, and then give the couple their own reality show.  Now that would be entertaining.</p>

<p>How excessive was his beating?  About an hour after he was treated at the hospital he was standing behind a bank of microphones holding a press conference.</p>
