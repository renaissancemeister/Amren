<p>David Gardner, Daily Mail (London), August 17, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Japanese citizens have shown incredible honesty in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami that brought the country to its knees.</p>
<p>It emerged yesterday that the Japanese returned almost $78million in cash found in the quake rubble.</p>
<p>In the five months since the disaster struck, people have turned in thousands of wallets and purses found in the debris, containing nearly $30 million in cash.</p>
<p>More than 5,700 safes that washed ashore along the coastline have also been hauled to police stations by volunteers and rescue crews.</p>
<p>Inside the safes officials found about $30million in cash. In one safe alone, there was the equivalent of $1,000,000.</p>
<p>Other contained gold bars, antiques and other valuables.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s National Police Agency said nearly all the money found in the areas worst hit by the tsunami has been returned to its owners.</p>
<p>Most people kept bankbooks or land rights documents with their names and addresses in their safes.</p>
<p>At one point, there were so many safes handed in to police that they had difficulty finding room to store them.</p>
<p>Even now, Koetsu Saiki, of the Miyagi Prefectural Police, said a handful of safes are handed in every week.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for the Japanese to keep large amounts of money at home and at offices, particularly in the coastal regions where fisheries companies prefer to deal with cash transactions.</p>
<p>From early April to late July, Ofunato Police Station hired three safe specialists to help open the safes it had recovered.</p>
<p>&#8216;In most cases, the keyholes on these safes were filled with mud,&#8221; said Mr Saiki.</p>
<p>&#8216;We had to start by cutting apart the metal doors with grinders and other tools.</p>
<p>&#8216;The fact that these safes were washed away, meant the homes were washed away too.</p>
<p>&#8216;We had to first determine if the owners were alive, then find where they had evacuated to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;There must be some safes that were stolen after the quake.</p>
<p>&#8216;But the fact that a hefty 2.3 billion yen in cash has been returned to its owners shows the high level of ethical awareness in the Japanese people,&rsquo; said Ryuji Ito, professor emeritus at Yokohama City University.</p>
