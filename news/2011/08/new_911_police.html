<h1>New 911 Police Tapes from Wisconsin State Fair Released</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Mullen, City Pages, August 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A huge fresh batch of 911 tapes has been released by the West Allis Police Department, shedding new light on the racially-fraught crime wave that gripped the Wisconsin State Fair last Thursday.</p>
<p>Call after call came in to the 911 dispatcher, each sounding similar but adding a new story: </p>
<p>&#8220;Hi I&rsquo;m calling because my kids came from the state fair and they were attacked by a group of black people that opened the car door and started punching them,&#8221; one woman tells the dispatcher. </p>
<p>Then, another caller: </p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, uhm, there was like 25 black kids that were trying to jump a State Fair park worker,&#8221; a woman says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the tapes, which were obtained by WTMJ, sound like echoes of each other.</p>
<p>One caller just after 11:30 said he &#8220;just wanted to make sure somebody got to the kid who was getting, just, pummeled on the side of the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The African Americans that were beating the hell out of him pulled him up off the sidewalk into the bush,&#8221; he says. And then: &#8220;And the security guard, the African American lady that was working that gate, her ass needs to be fired, because she didn&rsquo;t do a damn thing. She just stood there and watched.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another tape, a man who sounds drunk or dizzy tells the dispatcher he was jumped and beaten, and eventually turns his rage on her. </p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Yeah, there&rsquo;s a group of African Americans that are walking down 75th Street, going north, that thought it was okay to have a law abiding citizen walking by &hellip;  and they just jump me, what?&#8221;
<p>&#8220;Do you need an ambulance, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No I don&rsquo;t need an ambulance. I&rsquo;m bleeding but I don&rsquo;t give a shit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want an ambulance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No I don&rsquo;t want a fucking ambulance. Send some squads, arrest these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have squads all over the area you&rsquo;re going to have to walk up to an officer and find one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk up to an officer? I don&rsquo;t see an officer anywhere what are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have about 20 squads all around the general area.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean this is what I gotta go through, I pay taxes and I&rsquo;m walking down the fucking street  &mdash;  really?  &mdash;  and this is what the fuck happens, some stupid fucking black motherfuckers, they think they can just punch people, really?&#8221;</blockquote></p>

		<p>Police: Arrest Made in Wisconsin State Fair Violence <br>
The investigation into 11 of the violent incidents on the opening night of the Wisconsin State Fair has resulted in the arrest of a 16-year-old African-American who reportedly told investigators he targeted whites.</p>
<p>West Allis police said Thursday the teen was arrested late Wednesday. The Milwaukee teen was booked on suspicion of attempted robbery and robbery. Police recommend that he face additional penalties for hate crimes.</p>
<p>Police say the teen told investigators whites were chosen because he considered them &#8220;easy targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>On opening night of the fair last week, 31 people were arrested and at least 11 people were hurt. The West Allis Police Department has said race was a factor in the 11 violent incidents it&rsquo;s investigating.</p>
<p>The State Fair has stepped up security since the attacks.</p>

		<p>Some of the 911 operators sound callous and arrogant.</p>
<p>Also the callers sometimes just say he/she was attacked by &#8220;some people&#8221;   Clearly they are under the influence of political correctness.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been to countless community meeting with the police and they always advise us to &#8216;call 911&rsquo;. I can tell you from personal experience that calling 911 is like talking to a brick wall.</p>
<p>Notice the second caller and how the 911 operator responds, &#8216;That&rsquo;s not coming back as us&rsquo;. Not, &#8216;we have a officer check it our&rsquo; or &#8216;we&rsquo;ll re-direct your call&rsquo;. No, the response is &#8216;that&rsquo;s not coming back as us. Call someone else&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t ever believe you can count on 911 because you can&rsquo;t. The questions the operator will ask you are detached from the situation. &#8216;How old was the guy who was beaten?&rsquo; Why would you ask that question? The question should be &#8216;can you describe the assailants and which direction they were headed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;Sorry we can&rsquo;t help you, please call someone else&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Notice the reactions of the whites as well. Beaten and bloody, they refuse treatment. Blacks would be demanding an ambulance ASAP and preparing a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Infuriating.</p>

		<p>Wow, the attack was much larger than the media reported.  </p>
<p>This is far worse than the media reported, and it was obviously racial.  </p>
<p>911, the police and the media clearly can not deal with this.  Self-defence is your best defence.</p>
<p>Wow, listen to the end it is just deplorable (&#8220;have a good night&#8221; the 911 operator says).</p>

		<p>First thing: like military intelligence, African American Lady is a true oxymoron. Second thing: at approx 14:45 into the tape, a Sheriff no less, calls 911 and reports 25 youths doing some sort of mischief but he does not even give their ethnicity, even though it was apparent that a huge disturbance was in process. Gutless for a lead law enforcement officer like a sheriff to not even give a proper description.</p>

		<p>Can there be any doubt?  These black no-accounts are getting together to engage in the &#8220;sport&#8221; of white-hunting.  The objective is to seriously injure as many whites as possible and either not get caught OR have the police assert the motive wasn&rsquo;t racial and ergo non-hate crime&hellip;.  How long are we going to put up with this, folks?</p>

		<p>#3 you are dead on.  I noticed that, too.  She asks how old the victim was but never asked for a description of the assailants.</p>
<p>It really is frustrating to listen to.   You really can&rsquo;t rely on 911, the police, the media and certainly not the politicians.  These attacks will be covered up as quickly as possible by the aforementioned.</p>

		<p>White folk need to organize for self defense since they are being attacked as easy meat.  It is a terrible situation but it is being forced on us.  Self defense is legal.  Learn to defend yourself and your family by firearms and hand to hand.  Use of firearms is legal in the proper situations.  Watching your wife or kids being beat by a mob for fun is a strong motivation to self defense  Stop being professional victims for black folks or any other criminals</p>

		<p>You all may think this is really bad. It is not.<br>
Our race are stuffing popcorn in their lazy mouths while they watch the birthright of their children being stolen.<br>
If these lazy people need a good kicking to get them off the sofa then so be it.<br>
I want to see lots more if this. I want it to get much much worse. I want these lazy people to see their people being pummeled out of their car windows. I want them to be too scared to get out of their cars to help. I want the fact that they didn&rsquo;t help to eat them up. We need the deep anger to build up to a point so that people collectively reach a critical mass whereby they are ready to follow a leader,</p>

<p>Gentlemen, The Saxon needs to begin to Hate:</p>
<p>THE WRATH OF THE AWAKENED SAXON<br>
by Rudyard Kipling</p>
<p>It was not part of their blood,<br>
It came to them very late,<br>
With long arrears to make good,<br>
When the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>They were not easily moved,<br>
They were icy   &mdash;   willing to wait<br>
Till every count should be proved,<br>
Ere the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>Their voices were even and low.<br>
Their eyes were level and straight.<br>
There was neither sign nor show<br>
When the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>It was not preached to the crowd.<br>
It was not taught by the state.<br>
No man spoke it aloud<br>
When the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>It was not suddenly bred.<br>
It will not swiftly abate.<br>
Through the chilled years ahead,<br>
When Time shall count from the date<br>
That the Saxon began to hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This destiny does not tire, nor can it be broken, and its mantle of<br>
strength descends upon those in its service.&#8221; - Francis Parker Yockey, IMPERIUM</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that all these riots and flash mobs are just the beginning.  Soon they will be the norm.  What will wimpy whites do then?  When are people of courage going to take charge of the situation before our whole nation looks like Africa?</p>

		<p>Living in Northern WI, I&rsquo;m thankful to deal with very few minorities most days.  Up here, our main problem is Hispanic illegals milking the system and taking advantage of &#8220;don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell&#8221; local police policies, blacks &#8220;breeding up&#8221; our White women to start riding the benefits train, and a small amount of Asian and Somali gang activity.</p>
<p>But I live with the full knowledge that they will keep coming at us, even up here in the Northwoods, with more babies-on-benefits, white-girls-misguided, liberal-professors-rabble-rousing, violence-that-isn&rsquo;t-answered-with-deadly-force, and on and on and on until we, too, are overrun with their entitlements and lawlessness and disregard for classic Nordic and Western European and Judeo-Christian values&hellip;</p>
<p>The entire &#8220;majority&#8221; nation needs to stop giving away the store.</p>

		<p>Race and 911 calls&hellip;IMO, white people know that the tapes will be released and will be used against them or the victims.  Full descriptions of the perpetrators would be problematic. <br>
