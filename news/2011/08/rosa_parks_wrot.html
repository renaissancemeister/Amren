			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, July 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Discovered among Rosa Parks&rsquo; estate, which is currently at a New York auction house, is a six-page, handwritten essay in which a white man nearly rapes a black housekeeper. Because the essay is in the first person, some have concluded that Rosa Parks herself faced the rape attempt; others who knew her say that Parks often wrote fiction, and that this is one of her stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;This six-page essay we believe is a work of fiction,&#8221; Steven G. Cohen, a lawyer for the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development in Detroit, told the Associated Press. &#8220;We believe that Mrs. Parks meant for the story to be private. It never should have been part of the memorabilia collection.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many have taken the first-person story to be nonfiction. &#8220;Rosa Parks&rsquo; Archived Writing Reveals Attempted Rape,&#8221; writes <em>Time Magazine</em>. &#8220;Rosa Parks, civil rights heroine&rsquo;s essay reveals rape attempt by white neighbor,&#8221; says the <em>NY Daily News</em>. &#8220;Rosa Parks details attempted rape as teenager,&#8221; declares an Associated Press video posted at the <em>Washington Post</em>.</p>
<p>As the Associated Press notes, Parks did not recount the incident in either of her autobiographies.</p>
<p>{snip} If it is fiction, we should probably call it a &#8220;story,&#8221; not an &#8220;essay.&#8221; But we may never know how to read these six pages.  Parks died in 2005 at the age of 92.</p>

		<p>Hard to believe this. If what I have seen in the last few years is true, black women are raped by male relatives. Oprah says so, Maya Angelou says so. So I suspect this was just a fiction story she wrote to maybe make some money. Or if it stuck to the wall, then have something else to blame on the evil white man.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if it were fiction. After all, look at Crystal Mangum in the Duke University Rape hoax or the Tawana Brawley hoax and the mess she caused in New York by lying. That this too may be a hoax is very plausible.</p>
<p>In my practice, I have noticed many black women who indulge in some sick fantasies about interracial rape where they are the victim and a white male - someone they know or have contact with - is the aggressor. </p>
<p>They play this fantasy out in their minds but then they feel they must immediately atone for it by making up outright lies or by viciously attacking white males in Internet settings such as blogs or chat rooms or on news sites. </p>
<p>This behavior is more common than you would think among black women. </p>
<p>From my perspective, I would advise white males to stay as far away from black females as possible, as most of them are not mentally stable and are powder kegs looking for any excuse they can to go after a white male. </p>

		<p>Note the Rosa Parks&rsquo; estate lawyer indicates this is most likely fictional writing.  That said, the likelihood of a black being raped by a white is very small when compared to a white being raped by a black.  The only difference is how the press amplifies the former and the courts punish white offender more harshly.</p>

		<p>Like Gypsies, Aborigines, Albanians and White Liberal extremists, the Blacks lie a lot, often for sport even when there is little to gain but when there&rsquo;s lots to gain then they&rsquo;re that much more tempted to lie. BLACKNESS isn&rsquo;t so much a racial category as it is a degenerate state of mind like with Rosa Parks.</p>

		<p>Yeah, here&rsquo;s the story of another attempted rape featuring a famous black personality from the past.  I&rsquo;m sure it will shock the editors of <i>Time</i>, the <i>Wash Post</i>, etc.  From <i>Look</i> magazine:</p>
<p>&#8220;He entered the store, alone, stopped at the candy case. Carolyn was behind the counter; Bobo in front. He asked for two cents&rsquo; worth of bubble gum. She handed it to him. He squeezed her hand and said: &#8220;How about a date, baby?&#8221;</p>
<p>She jerked away and started for Juanita Milam. At the break between counters, Bobo jumped in front of her, perhaps caught her at the waist, and said: &#8220;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid o&rsquo; me, Baby. I been with white girls before.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point, a cousin ran in, grabbed Bobo and began pulling him out of the store. Carolyn now ran, not for Juanita, but out the front, and got the pistol from the Milam car.</p>
<p>Outside, with Bobo being ushered off by his cousins, and with Carolyn getting the gun, Bobo executed the &#8220;wolf whistle&#8221; which gave the case its name&#8221;</p>

		<p>It funny - when this story surfaced, virtually EVERY comment, response or observation made at any of the White-oriented message-boards I frequent was absolute disbelief. There was NO question in anyone&rsquo;s mind that this was nonsense. No doubt, each one of us would be denounced as a &#8220;hate monger&#8221; &#8220;racist&#8221; or all the usual epithets so many love to toss around, for daring to question the validity this Saint Parks artifact.</p>
<p>And then the truth dribbles out. What do you know, we were right&hellip;AGAIN!! As if it wasn&rsquo;t obvious to anyone capable of even a little critical thinking. </p>

		<p>A number of people who have researched Rosa Parks life stated that she often wrote fiction sotries. This is what this appears to be. Six pages. No big deal. </p>
<p>It is not a crime to write fiction. She probably had no idea that people would be talking about such a trivial matter in 2011. </p>

White men are taking time to discuss the actions (or delusions) of an African dimwit? (No, I&rsquo;m not referring to Eric Holder!)<br>
Huh&hellip;<br>
kind of explains in a nutshell why we&rsquo;re in sorry shape, and Am Ren  must be experiencing a slow news day.</p>
<p>Like trying to call out the Liberals for them trying to smear nationalists with Breivik&rsquo;s  little murder spree, this is a needless exercise. You don&rsquo;t try to explain, or distance yourself from the actions of a NUTJOB. <br>
Similarly, you NEVER try to discredit the reputation of a meaningless speck who never had credibility to begin with.<br>
It should be beneath you to waste two words on the subject, except to say&hellip;&#8221;Rosie WHO?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Either way, of course, it&rsquo;s not attempted rape.  But, as I previously pointed out, any pre-civil-rights sex between a white man and black woman was, in the liberal worldview, rape.  So, a white man trying to seduce a black woman was attempting rape.<br>
If anything approaching rape has occurred, the victim is the mind of America.  Civil-rights organizers set up the whole scenario on the bus and handpicked light-skinned Parks as their symbol.  Whenever I think of her, I picture a plastic woman whose intellect is unknown to me.  Even a potential short story penned by her cannot be recognized as such, because she can&rsquo;t be seen as a real person.</p>

Make <i>them</i> justify their actions.</p>

		<p>Given the long-established FBI stats for highly prolific black on white rape and the near-zero incidence of white on black rape, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that Rosa Parks&rsquo; tale of being raped by a white man are purest fiction.</p>

		<p>Just my opinion but I think Rosa Parks was a &#8220;terrorist&#8221;. Look at the resluts now, if White just riding in a city bus in downtown Detroit, New Orleans, D.C., Miami, ETC. after 8 PM (or noon for that matter). One good thing about this is the blacks that followed her home 25(?) years ago that robbed and almost beat her to death were not denied their civil rights and were allowed to sit up front in the bus as they stalked her.</p>

		<p> When I was in graduate school I had to take a black history class.  </p>
<p>The black professor told our entire class that the Rosa Parks bus incident was a set up.  It was planned ahead of time. </p>
<p>The true story was that a pregnant unwed black woman with no job would not give up her seat to a white man.  THAT gave the NAACP the idea to put Rosa Parks up to doing the same thing.  </p>
<p>A slight of hand which changes the story and image of Rosa significantly. </p>
<p>Reminds me of the Amazing Randi. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think anyone here doubts that there WERE a number of cases where white men forced unwanted attentions on black women during the years when slavery was legal in this country. There have always been men of every color who were less than honorable. HOWEVER, LEGALIZED BLACK SLAVERY ENDED NEARLY 150 YEARS AGO IN THIS COUNTRY! How long do we as a race have to go on paying in every imaginable way for the sins of as handful of rascals who may or may not have been our ancestors? We who DID NOT own slaves. We who DID NOT rape black women. We who DID NOT oppress the &#8220;noble victims&#8221; of the purported outrages we hear about daily. Furthermore, the contemporary so-called &#8220;victims&#8221; DID NOT suffer these outrages, their ancestors (maybe) did. </p>
<p>As an additional thought: while I DO consider the ownership of another human being as chattel to be an abomination; whatever else the slave owners of the past may have been, they were NOT stupid. A slave cost money, and if one was damaged or killed he or she had to be replaced. A plantation owner would no more string up a valuable, trained slave and beat or torture it for fun, than he would string up and beat or torture a valuable, trained saddle horse. The sheer economical cost of such a practice would have been a powerful deterrent, if simple humanity wasn&rsquo;t. </p>

<p>The woman originally chosen to stage the &#8220;incident&#8221; was actually a teenager but she had a foul mouth and was accustomed to swearing a lot and would have not made a good image. So she was removed from the project and a much more sedate woman was chosen for the &#8220;role&#8221;. Rosa was that woman. That famous photo of Rosa on a bus with a white man sitting nearby was a posed photo too. The whole episode was and unqualified NOT spontaneous.</p>

		<p><b>I absolutely do not believe for a minute that Rosa Parks was raped,</b> as the number of white-on-black rapes are so shockingly low due to their general unattractiveness and obesity. &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;<i>but I have no doubt that she and her manipulators would fabricate such nonsense and spring it on a guilt-afflicted media.</i></p>
<p>If moderates during the civil rights era could have seen the violence of flash mobs, the Wichita massacre, the L.A. riots and the murders of White South African farmers, then would have kicked Rosa&rsquo;s behind off that bus and made her walk. </p>
