<p class="articleSource">James Barron, New York Times, August 11, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Only the name has changed. The ingredients remain the same: wild freshwater crawfish, mayonnaise, celery, salt and sugar.</p>
<p>For at least 15 years, Zabar&rsquo;s, the Upper West Side grocery with the big crowds and even bigger prices, sold that as lobster salad-thousands and thousands of pounds of it, by itself in a plastic tub or on a bagel or a roll. Apparently no one noticed.</p>
<p>Then Doug MacCash, a reporter from The Times-Picayune of New Orleans, stopped at Zabar&rsquo;s while vacationing in Manhattan last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lobster salad on a bagel: Why not?&#8221; he wrote on Aug. 1 on the newspaper&rsquo;s Web site. &#8220;It was delicious, but the pink/orange tails seemed somehow familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He checked the label. &#8220;Wild fresh water crayfish?&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Really? At $16.95 per pound?&#8221; He photographed the label, just to be sure.</p>
<p>Mr. MacCash had discovered a fact of New York culinary life that New Yorkers had not: There was no lobster in the lobster salad at Zabar&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But if others were troubled by what seemed like a case of misrepresentation, Saul Zabar, the 83-year-old president and co-owner of Zabar&rsquo;s, was not.</p>
<p>Selling lobsterless lobster salad, he insisted, was not dishonest.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you go to Wikipedia,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will find that crawfish in many parts of the country is referred to as lobster.&#8221;</p>
<p>He read aloud the beginning of the Wikipedia entry for crawfish: &#8220;Crayfish, crawfish, or crawdads-members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea-are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related.&#8221;</p>
<p>By that definition, he said, he could call a product in which the main ingredient-actually, the only seafood ingredient-was crawfish, &#8220;lobster salad.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But amid the contretemps about crustaceans, Mr. Zabar said, he never considered replacing the crawfish with actual lobster. &#8220;Maine lobster is much chewier,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a nicer texture. It has a very nice flavor. If we used Maine lobster meat, it would be much more expensive.&#8221;</p>
