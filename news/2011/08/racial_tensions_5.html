<h1><a href="https://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15340203,00.html">Racial Tensions Rise in Czech Republic After Roma Attacks on Whites</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deutsche Welle, August 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The region of Sluknovsky vybezek is a crooked finger of land protruding from the northern reaches of Bohemia into Germany, not far from the city of Dresden. The inhabitants of the small towns in this remote region are an eclectic mix of Czechs, Romanies and Vietnamese traders  &mdash;  very different from the tightly-knit Sudeten German community who lived here until 1945.</p>
<p>Ethnic tension now appears to be growing in the region after two violent attacks by Roma youths on white people. The latest incident in the main town of Rumburk saw 20 Roma youths attack six white men with nightsticks after leaving a disco.</p>
<p>&#8220;They started beating us with truncheons and telescopic nightsticks,&#8221; Michal Nemecek, one of the victims, told Deutsche Welle. &#8220;They shouted &#8216;you white bastards&rsquo; at us. We definitely weren&rsquo;t the ones who provoked the attack  &mdash;  six against 20? We would have been crazy. They were just walking along the street and we were the first ones they ran into.&#8221;</p>
<p>Police say at least one man has been charged with racially motivated assault and battery and could face up to 12 years in prison. Charges are being prepared against a second detainee, and the remainder are being tracked down.</p>
<p>The Rumburk attack follows an incident in the nearby town of Novy Bor, in which a group of five Roma youths attacked three white men in a bar with a machete, leaving one of them seriously injured. This attack is also being treated as racially motivated.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Fear on the streets</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Our citizens simply don&rsquo;t feel safe in the streets of their own town,&#8221; said Jaroslav Sykacek, the mayor of Rumburk. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve heard that next year the Czech police are going to make 2,500 people redundant, and by 2013 the number of officers is supposed to fall by another 10,000,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I ask you this  &mdash;  who is supposed to protect our people? Who is supposed to maintain law and order?&#8221;</p>
<p>Observers have warned of serious racial tensions in the area, which is already suffering high levels of unemployment and poverty. There have been reports that real estate agents have been relocating Roma families to the region from elsewhere in the country after buying up their apartments, concentrating a large number of poor, poorly educated and unemployed people in one area.</p>
<p>The far-right Worker&rsquo;s Party has already vowed to march through Novy Bor in September to protest against the attacks, which Roma leaders themselves have condemned. Community leaders have appealed for calm, but the tensions certainly have the potential to boil over into new violence.</p>

		<p>My Father just got back from Slovakia &amp; Poland and he wa a disgusted about the gypsies, and also about his own kind, the Whites over there. He said that on the Slovak side of the border it was very unclean and litter everywhere. On the Poland side everything was well kept and tidy. Perhaps the Whites are settling into the lower caste behavior of gypsies. What a shame.</p>

<p>I lived in Slovenia in the late 90s and I think that perhaps I can shed some light on what your father saw.  In these once communist, Eastern European countries, the communities had people who cleaned up periodically.  I always noticed trash on streets, parks and even some countryside dumping accumulating, and then crews come out and clean it all up.  I thought this was ridiculous and it taught the people to behave like slobs, depending on the government to pick up their litter.  Slavs are litterbugs, period.  But when you have a breakdown of services as you do in Slovakia, the money disappears and these jobs end. It could also be part of the transition to private waste services.  So I am saying that the trashiness of what your father saw was likely due to this, PLUS what the Romas do anyway, which is to leave a trail of trash wherever they go.  The reason Poland was cleaner is probably that they are more influenced by Germany, which has always been a neat, clean culture.  Plus Poland is located nearer to other Scandinavian countries so their example would influence them sooner as well.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Czechs!! You (or more precisely, your national &#8220;hero&#8221; Edward Benes and his communist apparatchiks) committed one of the greatest atrocities in history of Europe by ethnically cleansing and massacring the millions of Sudetenland Germans after WWII, and subsequently repopulating the Sudetenland with gypsies that were imported from Romania and Slovakia for that purpose. And as such, I hope you will all continue to eat the post-war multi-racial diversity until you explode.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;What business do the Vietnamese have being there?&#8221;</p>
<p>To pay off enormous debts owed the Soviets from the era of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese government sent tens of thousand of Vietnamese men to work on labor projects in the old Soviet Union and East Germany.  Hard pick and shovel and back breaking GULAG style labor on all sorts of &#8220;works&#8221; projects. Those Vietnamese decided to stay and voila&rsquo;, now you have them. </p>

		<p>I also was taken aback about the vietnamese.  In the czech republic of all place?  Romania didn&rsquo;t want the gypsies, so they encourage them immigrate.  They bring trouble everywhere they go.  I read a report once by a social justice activist who reported that his organization donated hundreds of nice winter coats to gypsies, only to find a few weeks later that all the gypsies were still wearing their raggedy old coats.  They had all sold their nice coats for drug money!  The activist expressed surprise and regret.</p>

		<p>I lived in Hungary six months. Gypsy population is about to explode all across Central Europe. Nobody has invited them, their tribal, nomadic culture is ultimately incompatible with Europe. They have actually no right to be in Europe. They were not invited, they were not colonized by Europeans, they have no ties to those countries.</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know how did they end up in East-Central Europe and I can&rsquo;t understand how few progress they have made to become civilized.</p>

		<p>But don&rsquo;t the Roma have the right to attack white people for the terrors they endured in the Holocaust?<br>
 It seems every race that is non white is supposed to be able to rape and murder as they please so long as they can tie their actions to whatever oppression they can trace the whites to no matter how tenuous.</p>

		<p>You see the same thing in Spain, especially in Andalucía. They&rsquo;re always &#8220;up to something&rsquo; and always have been.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago on a student trip to Spain from a Catholic High School in Philadelphia, one of our students was walking down a street in Sevilla when a gypsy woman ran up to him thrust a baby wrapped in a blanket at him. The kid reflexively took the baby whereupon&#8221; la gitana&#8221; took off running. The kid walked to where our group was and declared &#8220;Some woman just handed me a baby&#8221;. We took the infant to the nearest Guardia Civil post.</p>
<p>In future trips to Spain the Gitanos always seemed to be engaged in annoying people. The kids would surround you and poke at you and while you were occupied were very skillful at relieving you of your wallet and sometimes even your watch. <br>
The one thing that they feared during the Franco years was the Guardia Civil. That&rsquo;s when Spain was a place where you could walk in the Retiro Park which was Madrid&rsquo;s equivalent of Central Park (except much safer then) at any time of day or night because Los Guardias were always on patrol. When &#8220;democracy&#8221; hit Spain everything changed. A maitre d&rsquo; at a hotel went on a rant about the immigration from S. America and how violent the Peruvians and Ecuadorians were.  He actually expressed his nostalgia for the Franco days when Spain was safe.  <br>
The last time I was there we got into a cab in Madrid and there was a Lexan barrier between us and the driver. It had small holes so that we could communicate but there was none of the back and forth banter between passengers and driver. Also the fair was paid via a sliding drawer like the one at the drive up bank window.<br>
Very sad</p>

<p>They were invited in out of Communist solidarity back when the Iron Curtain was still in place. But once it came down, more came in via chain migration.</p>

<p>A while back I wrote a comment that when I lived in Spain the gypsies hadn&rsquo;t been a problem. I should have written a correction. After thinking about it I realized that the gypsies weren&rsquo;t a problem because when I lived in Spain Franco was in charge. </p>
<p>I read some nationalist blogs from Spain and I have no desire to visit Spain again. I prefer to remember it as the safe civilized country that I knew back then. I&rsquo;ve also noticed in news photos from Spain that the population is getting darker.     </p>

<p>I remember when gypsies came to town. Women rushed to take the laundry off the line, lock up the chickens, call in the children.  Lean a broom outside next to the door. Supposedly they would not come to that house. Some kind of superstition.<br>

		<p>Cid Campeador - I know someone from Spain who echoes your comments. She says the Roma kids regularly steal purses, wallets, etc. The adults send the little kids in to do the dirty jobs, and if you grab hold of the little demon, heaven help you - here comes the child abuse charges. Pathetic what has happened. Of course with the low Spanish birth rate, I don&rsquo;t see them being around for long. I just wonder will any country (Russia, Germany, Australia, etc) ever put it&rsquo;s foot down and encourage people of European lineage to move there. I&rsquo;m sure things would have to get much worse, but the US is quickly getting to the point where it simply is not our nation anymore.</p>

		<p>The back and forth about the GNSWP and its leader, and what Europe would have been like had Germany won that war, and what White civilization would have been like&hellip;the &#8220;what-if&#8221; history conversation fascinates me from an abstract angle.</p>
<p>I once bought a book about &#8220;what if&#8221; hypothetical history stories.  I put it in storage next to my bottle of snake oil, my feather light duster mop that makes my floors shiny and clean as new, and the doohickey which gives me rock solid abs if I use it 5 minutes a day 3 days a week.  </p>
<p>There are just way too many variables in human civilization to say for sure what would have happened but for a certain event or changing the outcome of a certain event.  All we know for sure is what did happen in our real world (in as much as we can read between the lines of what leftist historians want us to know).</p>

The Guardia Civil stood for no nonsense and kept the Gypsies under tight control.  Spain was very safe, and the Spainiards (not Gypises) were  respectful and very honest people.  My first encounters with Gypsies were in Spain.  I was young,  without bias, and had an open mind. I knew nothing about Gypsies,  but I earned about them very quickly, from personal experience.  </p>
<p>I can endorse everything you have said above.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s much more that could be said. At least then, the problem could be discussed. Now, with Multi-racialism, Ethnic Diversity, and Political Correctness ruling us as the new official ideologies, the whole subject is being made undiscussable, a thought-crime that in some countries could bankrupt you and land you in prison. </p>

<p>PS.  Excellent comment above  from Roger!   Right on the mark.</p>

What business do the Vietnamese have being there? True, they do not seem to have caused any violence here, but why FURTHER COMPLICATE a racial issue? As for the Roma they have been nothing but a plague on Europe for centuries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its obvious you&rsquo;ve never been to the Pacific coast states where there are violent gangs of Vietnamese. just as there are Hispanics, Blacks, Filipinos. Samoans and others.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was my observation back in around 1975-76, that when the first Vietnamese settled there, street gangs came with them.  IMO, this is what stimulated the Mexicans and blacks in the LA area to form gangs and gave birth to the huge gang problem that continues to do incalculable harm to America (and Mexico).</p>
<p>War always causes huge and culture changing effects.  The historian can see the link between our corrupt war in Vietnam and the culture it produced that was eventually imported to our shores.  Only the nonobjective and biased would deny this undesirable and plainly true consequence.</p>

		<p>I recall visiting a liberal woman I know a few years back. She bought an expensive, upscale house in Hollywood, CA. It was very close to a Russian neighborhood. The Russians would brazenly picnic on her front lawn and simply leave their trash everywhere. It wasn&rsquo;t a stray wrapper or two, but they left all of their trash. These folks were not of color, they were white with blond hair, etc. Many Russians and Ukranians are nice folks, but they have problems, as well as criminal gangs that exceed the brutality of the black and hispanic gangs. Some of the white immigrants aren&rsquo;t so wonderful either. </p>

		<p>Poster number 6, I don&rsquo;t know where you got your impression of Slavs as slobs, but I&rsquo;m of Polish ancestry and the neighborhood that my parents were raised in was so neat and tidy you could almost eat off the sidewalks. This had nothing to do with being influenced by the Germans or Scandanavians, but more by morals, standards, and the same Judeo-Christian ethic most European peoples were raised with, which equated cleanliness with Godliness. </p>

		<p>&#8220;And there&rsquo;s much more that could be said. At least then, the problem could be discussed. Now, with Multi-racialism, Ethnic Diversity, and Political Correctness ruling us as the new official ideologies, the whole subject is being made undiscussable, a thought-crime that in some countries could bankrupt you and land you in prison&#8221; <br>
This was a comment above referring to Franco&rsquo;s Spain. This is what scares me, when people get oppressed like Whites in the USA. Why do I say that in reference to the Franco lovefest above. Because I as a White tourist in Franco&rsquo;s Spain was picked by mistake as a suspect in a crime in Seville. To get me to confess I had my nose broken, all my toes and fingers broken. I went to the U.S embassy, they told me if I complain I would probably have drugs planted on me. Please my fellow Whites despite our current predicament, do not wish for such a situation. Our founding fathers knew what they were doing. Later generations blew it by horrible amendments. But I do not want to be tortured again, like the 18 year old kid who lost his innocence on that horrible day in august 1975.</p>

<p>Thanks for introducing me to something I&rsquo;ve never heard of. I guess an entire culture can be completely reversed in only a couple of generations.</p>

		<p>About ten years ago my sister was in Venice where there are quite a few Gypsies. She was riding on the Vaporetto which I guess you might describe as an aquatic bus.  Upon arriving at their hotel one of her traveling companions discovered that the entire bottom of her shoulder tote bag had been sliced open and her travelers checks, her passport, camera and other items were gone.  The Vaporetti are generally crowed and there&rsquo;s a lot of jostling going on which provides a perfect environment for such larcenous surgery. The majority of the offenders are usually gypsies according to the Carabinieri. Unlike our home grown &#8220;youths&#8221;, they employ stealth rather than physical violence to accomplish their mission.</p>

		<p>A single male Dr friend lives near the bar and club neighborhood.</p>
<p>Several times a week he goes to the bars.  Gypsy women come in the bars and sell roses.  He got aquainted with one.  She told him she had a disabled daughter and would he exam her, they had medicaid for the 15 year old.</p>
<p>They came and wanted him to classify her as severely retarded and disabled. He told them no.  They offered hin $3,000 cash which they brought with them to diagnose her as disabled.  He refused.  Finally they left.</p>
<p>Next day he gets a call from the local police.  We&rsquo;re coming over today to talk to you.  Seems the parents and 15 year old daughter went directly to the nearest police station and told them that he had molested the daughter right there in his office with the parents watching.</p>
<p>The police came over, asked him what happened and dropped the case.  They were nice enough to write that the accusation was totally unfounded in their report.</p>
<p>The detectives said that gypsies are constantly making false police reports against each other.</p>
<p>Our city is plagued by gypsies who rob wealthy homes in which elderly, really elderly I mean 85, not 65 year old women live alone. The usual practice is a gypsy woman and 2 or 3 pitiful little kids knock on the door &#8220;our car broke down can we use the phone&#8221;.</p>
<p>Come in.  </p>
<p>By the way, can the kids use the bathroom?  Certainly.<br>
The kids then charge around and steal everything they can.  If the woman tries to stop them they knock her down.  Not much an 85 year old can do against an adult and kids.</p>
<p>Usually the home is robbed of big items like TVs, computers, anything saleable a few days later.  While going to the bathroom the kids find an out of the way window and unlock it.</p>
<p>It is very obvious that the gypsies stake out these homes in advance.  They never rob homes in which people under the age of 60 live and never rob homes with more than 1 person living in it.</p>

		<p>Currently working in Brno, the other side of Czech. Relations here between Czechs and Gypsies are peaceful but it&rsquo;t noticeable that in the Gypsy parts of town like Trnita dilapidated and filthy with ragged children playing on the streets. The difference between the Gypsy areas and the white areas is like night and day. They&rsquo;re certainly good at one thing and that&rsquo;s having children.</p>

Its like women and men aren&rsquo;t fascinated unless it is one thing to accomplish with Lady gaga! Your own stuffs excellent. Always maintain it up!</p>
