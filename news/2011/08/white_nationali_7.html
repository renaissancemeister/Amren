<h1>White Nationalists as the New Queers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Weissberg, American Renaissance, August 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>I was dismayed when Frank Borzellieri was <a href="/news/2011/08/cowards_in_the.html">fired</a> as principal of Our Lady of Mount Carmel School over his ties to a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; group. Not only did the newspaper account that led to his dismissal wrongly call <em>American Renaissance</em> &#8220;white supremacist&#8221; but his firing violates a core principle of American law: &#8220;bad thoughts&#8221; are not yet a crime. No one even suggested that he had harmed the black and Hispanic students in his care. The article concerned only Frank&rsquo;s past writings, not his current behavior. Just being a white &#8220;racist,&#8221; which was never defined, was sufficient grounds for dismissal. Even more surprising was how this obscure incident was widely picked up by the press  &mdash;  even in England  &mdash;  though it lacked any sex or violence, the usual elements that bring notoriety.   </p>
<p>A day later, however, I experienced a Eureka moment and not only grasped the significance of Frank&rsquo;s firing but understood it in the context of the recent upsurge in anti-&#8220;white nationalism&#8221; campaigns. Examples would include AR&rsquo;s troubles with its conferences, the coolness of mainstream publishers towards &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; books etc. etc.  (I use &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; for lack a better term. As <a href="/news/2011/08/what_is_white_n.html">Jared Taylor </a>points out, much of what today&rsquo;s &#8220;racists&#8221; say was broadly accepted until recently, and there was no word for what was then mainstream thinking.)</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the insight: &#8220;white nationalism&#8221; has replaced homosexuality in America&rsquo;s Pantheon of Horrific Sins. Just as adults once sought to protect children from homosexuals, who were assumed to be irrepressible child molesters, the great new fear is exposure to white &#8220;racists&#8221; who might corrupt impressionable youngsters by warning them about the dangers of diversity or, heaven forbid, teach them that race really does exist and that not all racial groups are equally talented. Out with the old, in with the new. The headline of the article that got Frank fired could have been &#8220;Pervert Found Teaching Young Children.&#8221; </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this incident occurred in a Catholic school. The nervous local Archbishop probably imagined future lawsuits in which adults would come forward with lurid tales of how Father Frank instilled racial hate and inflicted permanent psychological damage: &#8220;I still dread talking to African Americans and thus cannot get a job in today&rsquo;s workforce.&#8221; There could be yet more million-dollar settlements and parish bankruptcies. </p>
<p>All societies ensure social cohesion by establishing &#8220;official&#8221; sins and stigmatizing offenders. Sanctioned hate objects may be foreigners or unsavory subgroups, such as Gypsies, but front and center are moral strictures regarding good and evil. Moral orthodoxy is the essence of religion, and without strictures society is impossible. To be sure, the sin catalogue varies from place to place and shifts over time. </p>
<p>As we all know, except among certain religious fundamentalists, homosexuality has gone from being a vile, legally punishable sin to a mere preference, even one celebrated by the <em>New York Times</em>. This transformation is hardly atypical. Alcoholism, illegitimacy, sloth, promiscuity, gluttony, adultery, pre-marital sex, pornography, habitual mendacity, and fornication, to name just a few, have all been downgraded from grave moral violations to treatable illnesses or just harmless personal life choices. You can now buy books on how to masturbate. Some past unacceptable behaviors, such as public begging and public profanity, are now legally protected rights. </p>
<p>Our stock of moral offenses is declining, and social cohesion requires that we find new ones. Even in an age of moral relativism there must be something, <em>something</em> that indisputably offends the orthodoxy. And what better choice in today&rsquo;s times of ethnic/racial turmoil than &#8220;white nationalism,&#8221; &#8220;hate,&#8221; and all their variants? </p>
<p>I do not exaggerate: to be accused of &#8220;white nationalism&#8221; or white &#8220;racism&#8221; is quickly becoming the equivalent of being charged with atheism in 16th century Europe or being a communist during the Cold War. It is the perfect candidate for demonization because &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; do not riot when persecuted, lack any powerful lobbying group that could get them included in the latest hate crime law, and never insist that school textbooks highlight their contributions to American history. Can you imagine a 9th grade US history textbook claiming that a &#8220;race realist&#8221; wrote the Declaration of Independence?   </p>
<p>This designation as a moral evil is full of consequences. Choices regarding policy permit rational debate. One can, for example, safely discuss tax policy; by contrast, debates over moral issues are emotional and are settled by a quick, &#8220;That&rsquo;s just bad!&#8221; Imagine someone trying to defend gay marriage in 1955. Such a person, no matter how plausible his arguments, would not only be judged wrong but mentally ill, a threat to society, or worse. Today, of course, the opposite is true in some settings. </p>
<p>It is not a question of bad information or incorrect analysis. Those who defend certified evils are bad people to the core, not just misinformed. Would you buy a used car from a white &#8220;racist?&#8221; Frank Borzellieri&rsquo;s lack of respect for Martin Luther King, Jr. demonstrated an inability to teach black and Hispanic children. Those who doubt this &#8220;fact&#8221; have only to read his evil books. Once he was tagged a &#8220;racist,&#8221; Frank could have said that 2+2 equals 4, and many educators would disagree.</p>
<p>That today&rsquo;s &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; are treated like homosexuals when homosexuality was a criminalized sin does, however, offer some useful parallels. Most depressingly, it means it is pointless to try to refute moral judgments with facts. It is the equivalent of bringing up the biological basis of homosexuality at a time when sodomy was a capital offense. Second, many &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; have to learn how to cover up, just as gays did. They may decorate their offices with multicultural books, or take a page from the anti-immigration, anti-Catholic Know Nothing Party of the mid-19th century: When asked about the party, members were told to say, &#8220;I know nothing.&#8221; It may also help to become a skilled liar and toss around false accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; to demonstrate commitment to multiculturalism.  </p>
<p>But even if you are outed, there is hope. Just admit that, &#8220;Yes, I am a white nationalist, a racist, even a white supremacist, but this is because my kindergarten teacher read <em>American Renaissance</em> and now I&rsquo;m undergoing therapy, and my therapist says that in a few years I&rsquo;ll be normal.&#8221; Don&rsquo;t laugh  &mdash;  this was the Catholic Church&rsquo;s approach to homosexual priests who molested children: push them into therapy and then get a certificate certifying a cure. Counseling also rehabilitates Hollywood celebrities caught shoplifting or taking drugs. </p>
<p>It is essential to make a confession, beg for forgiveness, and repent. No doubt, if Frank had apologized, gone into therapy, and confessed to Reverend Eric Rapaglia who hired him, he would be rehabilitated within a year. He would be back on the job, announcing that all of his students were going to Harvard.   </p>
<p>Be optimistic. Perhaps in time &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; and &#8220;racists&#8221; will be able to hold teaching jobs. Some day they may even be able to marry, and their engagements will be prominently featured in the <em>New York Times</em>. And, naturally, people will be shocked to see how many of them come out of the closet.   </p>

		<p>Anti-smoking, the last refuge of the moral instinct in America. And it&rsquo;s the only thing I &#8220;do&#8221;. - Allan Bloom</p>
<p>Yes, today smoke-free gay weddings are the norm.  Witness Michael Bloomberg, who embodies every progressive impulse and opinion under one roof.  He banned smoking in bars, parks and beaches and later presided over the wedding of two late middle-aged men, all in the presence of young girls - precisely the demographic he means to protect from &#8220;secondhand smoke.&#8221;  I suppose a cigarette smoking &#8220;racist&#8221; would be the greatest public evil today.</p>
<p>There has been a revolutionary inversion in public morality.  I&rsquo;m actually surprised Mr. Borzellieri survived this long in a NYC school.  </p>

		<p>Well, we do have an image problem sometimes.  The white skinheads do us no favors as a white people simply trying to hold on to our traditions and culture.  Certain redneck types also are problematic.</p>
<p>I promote simple American civility such as was practiced until the 1950s.  After that, it was all down hill with too much immorality and loose living.  Those of us who remember how our grandparents were - generally respectful, reserved and industrious - though there were always some bad apples - can appreciate how much our culture has changed with lady gaga setting the standard.</p>

		<p>I think whites suffer from failure to organize along racial lines.  Al Sharpton has a show on MSNBC even though he has a controversial past.  Sharpton runs something called the National Action Network.  That is what we need.  We need a network of white protestors, legal consultants, activists, etc.   It has to be organized along racial lines, just as La Raza, NAACP, NAN, etc.  But whites are too busy worrying about how they will be perceived.  </p>

		<p>Here in the Bible Belt, most folks still believe homosexuality is wrong, and they believe race-realism is right.  Because of the power of the elite left in establishing political correctness, however, they keep their opinions to themselves while at work or in social gatherings.  White people from the top eschelon to the lowest play it safe and say nothing that could be construed as making even the merest, most innocent reference to race or to blacks per se.  Thus, whites are uncomfortable around blacks, and the two ethnic groups are wider apart than they ever were.  <br>
In private, though, these same whites speak plainly about their feelings regarding homosexuals and blacks.  The only difference I see anymore is that some folks think homosexuality might be inborn  &mdash;  like a birth defect, mind you  &mdash;  instead of being a mental aberration that developed during socialization.   </p>

		<p> This story brings to mind the holocaust in Sweden. The Nazis after taking over demanded that all jews in the country sew a yellow star of David on their clothes so they could be identified.<br>
 The next day the King of Sweden took his normal morning walk with a Star sewn prominently on his jacket and by nightfall all the citizens were wearing stars of David.<br>
  Maybe as a sign of oppression we should wear the not equal greater than math symbol sewn on our clothes.</p>

		<p>This off the topic but I haven&rsquo;t seen mention of an important recent event on this website: the recent helicopter tragedy in Afghanistan. The tragic deaths involved 30 of America&rsquo;s finest and bravest. It appears from a slide show I saw today on the anti-White Washington Post website that 28 or 29 of the 30 are clearly White Americans.<br>
Also, after about 60 comments the Post shut down commenting which is highly unusual for such a news item. I suspect people started noticing and mentioning this fact: the Tip of the Spear is overwhelmingly White! Yet blacks are over-represented in the military relative to their numbers in the general population. </p>

		<p>White nationalism is the new *witchcraft!* In 17th century Western societies thousands were burned at the stake as witches.<br>
Who defined witchcraft? A self-appointed body of leading citizens.<br>
Who were designated as witches? Anyone considered offensive to society by this same unelected body.<br>
How serious a crime was witchcraft? It was the worst offense known to God and man.<br>
How could people recognize witches? They were pointed out by those who considered themselves qualified to do so.<br>
How pernicious was witchcraft? It was considered as the root cause of almost every misfortune that could be encountered.<br>
Control over something considered as witchcraft amounted to control over the whole of society. The &#8216;epidemic&rsquo; of witchcraft only ended, in New England at least, when members of society&rsquo;s elite began to find themselves accused of this heinous offense. <br>
We have the same thing today. We are demonized by invented accusations intended to put us on the defensive and then on the retreat. This can only be countered by making our accusers and their audiences aware of just how self-serving these accusations are. There are plenty of modern-day &#8216;witch-hunters.&rsquo; All are following their own anti-white agendas and we need to show the world that these particular emperors do not have any clothes.</p>

		<p>The Church&rsquo;s approach to Homosexual Clergy, at one time, was to do everything possible to ensure that they did not enter the Seminaries. Vatican II changed alot of things, none for the better. </p>
<p>Also, remember that with the Cultural Marxists, they vowed to enter, and then destroy, all of our Institutions that were at the center of White American Christian life in the US. </p>
<p>The Marxists got into the Public High Schools and Colleges and warped young American minds, as far back as the 1950s, but it really showed itself during the 1960s.</p>
<p>Also, what was big beginning in the 1960s was &#8220;Liberation Theology&#8221;, that took hold in all of Latin America, and Africa. This is a denigration of the true faith. </p>
<p>Both Protestant Churches and their Missionaries, along with this newly twisted Catholic &#8220;Liberation Theology&#8221; minded Seminarians or Missionaries, did its work at eating at the core of both Protestant and Catholic Churches.</p>
<p>Would you care to take a guess at how many Methodist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran Churches I pass in a day, among many others, that have large signs in English and Spanish, or Korean? All of them. </p>
<p>If they want to Evangelize to these people, and bring the Gospels to them, that&rsquo;s wonderful, but can&rsquo;t these people remain in their own countries and be saved?  </p>

		<p>I might quibble on some of the details, but in essence Dr. Weissberg is exactly right.</p>
<p><i> All societies ensure social cohesion by establishing &ldquo;official&rdquo; sins and stigmatizing offenders. </i> </p>
<p>This is exactly what happened in the 60&rsquo;s.  At the sexual revolution, when all forms of sexual &#8220;expression&#8221; were deemed acceptable, there had to be <i>some</i> official &#8220;sin&#8221; to replace the ones that were now deemed OK, and &#8220;racism&#8221; became the one sin that was unforgivable. It was a neat little inversion of reality, a nice example of societal mind control. </p>
<p>The amazing thing about it was that this complete inversion of hundreds (thousands?) of years of accepted reality took place within the span of just a single decade, and by the 70&rsquo;s the orthodoxy was almost as entrenched as it is today.</p>

		<p>Good article, Dr. Weissberg!</p>
<p>As the old Chinese saying goes, The nail that sticks up is the first to get hammered!</p>
<p>However, integrity demands that one stand up!</p>
<p>As you state, though, there is no harm in saying that you are re-evaluating your perceptions (a good thing to do, occasionally), and are in the counsel of a wise and compassionate confidant (also good). Just don&rsquo;t mention that the confidant is Jared Taylor! </p>
<p>Conservatives need to stop being so stiff, to learn to dance, to bob and weave, to put out the fog!</p>
<p>That is why conservatives need the counsel of &#8220;intuitive&#8221; people. Stop looking down on us. We are the artistic types. We know the big picture. We can push the boundaries, make them more pliable, while still maintaining our integrity. </p>
<p>We startle you; you think we are not moral. You are largely wrong. We just see things in new and living categories. </p>

		<p>A few years ago my young nephew told me that all of his friends were getting their bikes stolen&hellip;.he paused and looked around and whispered, &#8220;and black kids are the ones stealing them.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It occured to me the media had convinced my nephew and others that THEY were the bad ones if they noticed that the person stealing from them, beating them, or robbing them was black.</p>
<p>This is the result of brain washing in the form of political correctness over a 50 year period.  We are too civilized for our own good.   </p>

		<p>Homosexuals have one advantage over white identity people. There is a job market for polite gay men to serve wealthy women as shoe salesmen, waiters and hair dressers. Women like being served by such men. It is fun chatting with men when there are no clumsy sexual advances. Often gaytown is adjacent to the rich boutique district of a city. </p>

		<p>I always wonder who in the world comes up with these titles?</p>
<p>Gay meant happy, and a lot of homosexuals are not happy.</p>
<p>Black means (black) not some shade of brown.</p>
<p>Queer or homosexual seems right with queer meaning not quite on the everyday track being a little different, what the problem with that?</p>
<p>Blacks can never seem to get it right or make up their minds as to what they want to be called over any length of time, doesn&rsquo;t a word like colored or even &#8220;negro&#8221; which means black in Spanish be more accurate?</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s funny.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen, <i>pedophilia</i> is the new homosexuality.  The idea being to make homosexuality itself look ever so much acceptable by comparison.</p>
<p>Racism is the new <i>Communism</i>, and the entire leftist governmedia apparatus is the new House Un-american Activities Committee, to which there is no appeal.  <br>

		<p>Re #13:<br>
Homosexuals/Gays/Queers had another advantage: they helped each other. I observed in the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s, before they became a legal Minority, the way they would cooperate with each other in matters of protection, employment, and housing. Their sexual preference was a great uniting factor, overriding religious, politics, income, etc. </p>
<p>If White Nationalists are the &#8220;new queers&#8221;, they would be wise to emulate the &#8220;old queers&#8221; solidarity.</p>

		<p>I live on a small barrier island near a resort city. There is one bridge to my island. One frequently sees Black &#8220;youths&#8221; riding their bikes over the bridge, each one bearing two &#8220;youths&#8221;. People testify that shortly afterward these &#8220;youths&#8221; are seen going back over the bridge with each one on a bike. The audacity and arrogance of these people is unbelievable. </p>

<p>I wonder apout the proliferation of &#8216;gay-friendly &rsquo; entertainers, I think it&rsquo;s more of a marketing ploy. If a gaggle of gays like your &#8216;music&rsquo;, they&rsquo;ll spend every last cent on all of your silly merchandise. Lady Gaga certainly knows what side of the bread the butter goes on.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This story brings to mind the holocaust in Sweden. The Nazis after taking over demanded that all jews in the country sew a yellow star of David on their clothes so they could be identified.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hate to be pedantic but this was Denmark and not Sweden. And of course the King was not afraid to do so because he knew the Nazi would not touch him.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Women like being served by such men.&#8221;  Yuck, I don&rsquo;t.  I don&rsquo;t like guys who hit up on me   &mdash;   one of my many problems with non-Whites, but homosexual men give me the creeps.  This is true whether they are &#8220;feminine&#8221; or are the ultra &#8220;macho&#8221; types.  I have no real objections to what anyone does in the bedroom as long as all parties agree, but once it gets out of the bedroom and into the street, I object.  And the fact is that many male homosexuals enjoy being exhibitionists and <b>like</b> offending people.</p>
<p>As for the Catholic Church, they are one of the major supporters of illegal Mexicans after all.  They have always appeared to be &ldquo;anti-racist&rdquo; and pro-multiculti to me.  I am surprised Frank Borzellieri wasn&rsquo;t fired years ago.<br>

		<p>The men I prefer as shoe salesmen or whatever are heterosexual men in happy, committed relationships with a female.  No crude advances and no being ticked off at me because I remind them of the wife or girlfriend they are in in bad relationship with (or because I remind them of their ex).  And because he is in a good relationship, he is going to be in a better mood generally.  Also he is going to understand women and their tastes and temperaments far better than some homosexual man.</p>

		<p>All of these comments and the entire angst of this forum have to do with our defeat by our leftist opponents. We in western countries have been defeated because we held FREEDOM above all other concerns.  As the old Getty Oil Company ad once said, &#8220;Freedom is our most prescious possession.&#8221;  However, when freedom is held more vital than survival, we wind up dead and unfree too.  We have given freedom to our enemies, to moral perverts, to subversives, to thieves, and they used that freedom to subvert and overthrow us.  Now we are powerless to defend ourselves, and our prescious freedom.  Angst is exactly the right feeling for those starring at their extinction.   </p>

		<p>It is absolutely crucial that Native Born White Americans define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;. We have to make the race-replacement issue the fundamental issue that frames the &#8220;debate&#8221;. It is impossible to halt and reverse race-replacement unless we do this.</p>
<p>We must staty away from issues that sidetrack away from the race-replacement issue. The open justification for post-1965 immigration policy is the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority. If we define the terms of the debate this way, we will-with 100 percent certainty-raise the racial conciousness of our fellow Native Born White Americans. And when this happens, it is going to be much more difficult for the race-replacement enthusiasts to harm our very brave comrades such as Frank Borzellieri&hellip;there is safety in members!!!</p>
<p>Gasoline has been poured into the basement of America for 40 years. Recent events in Europe and America now make it clear beyond a shadow of doubt that the ignition of the gasoline has occured. We are being given an opportunity to raise Native Born White American Racial Conciousness about race-replacement&hellip;don&rsquo;t blow..take the ball and run with it!!! The most foolish thing that could be done now is to sidetrack the race-replacemenet issue with an eyes-glaze-over-mind-numbing discussion about IQ and race psychometric babble. You will never raise Native Born White American Racial Conciousness if you raise this issue..it is just completely irrelevant to the fundamental issue.</p>
<p>One last point. I think a much better term than &#8220;White Nationalism&#8221; is &#8220;Native Born White American Patriot Movement&#8221;. Every post-1965-high fertility nonwhite racial&hellip;and in our faces within the borders of America. We must do the same..Racial Nationalism is the only game in town for millions of Native Born White Americans..and it is, the only way that we are going to be able to protect very brave Native Born White American Men such as Frank Borzellieri.</p>
<p>Frank is the Frankish name for spear. Frank is the most important name in European History. It is a warrior&rsquo;s name.</p>

		<p>Yes, the article is true - racially conscious/loyal Whites are now treated as the deviants/sinners of society.</p>
<p>This is why we must go away from &#8220;conservative&#8221; ways of thinking and acting. The system - the powers that be are not ours. We don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;conserve&#8221; the status quo.</p>
<p>Our options must be those used effectively by groups that are out of power, that are on the margins. We should look at successful groups like the Amish who do not try to participate in the mainstream society.</p>
<p>Gays were once shunned and persecuted - they managed to find ways to survive - so must we.</p>

		<p>I disagree somewhat.  I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as unacceptable today to say something &#8220;racist&#8221; in the presence of other Whites as it was in 1955 to express support for gay marriage.  Indeed, in 1955 it was probably true that most Americans believed that gay marriage was immoral or otherwise unacceptable; whereas today it is probably not reciprocally true that most White Americans honestly believe that diversity is a strength, or that Whites and Blacks are essentially similar in their behavior. </p>
<p>I think the media has failed in fooling Whites into believing that diversity is positive and enriches their lives. It has, however, succeeded in creating a sense of paranoia among Whites that expressing their racial beliefs openly may harm their careers and/or harm their social relations (it may). </p>

		<p>I live in California where many gays come to settle. They&rsquo;re everywhere here.  It&rsquo;s more open here than anywhere in the country. Yes, there are gays that have those stupid parades and radical politics..who are whiny, feminine, etc. You think they are all like that, because those are the ones you see. That is wrong. Gays are everywhere to a certain percentage. Many are quite moderate to conservative, even racially aware&hellip;especially ones with money. There are also several on the police force and military. </p>
<p>Gays are often successful and  typically physically fit&hellip;only interested in the same. I see so many people in hysterics, ranting and raving&hellip;&#8221;I&rsquo;m so afraid of gays hitting on me or my kids&#8221;. Like any human, they have there own private bedroom interests. They have NO physical interest in the average person nor children (whom they generally find obnoxious and annoying). </p>
<p>To illustrate my point, a good friend of mine from Arkansas, heterosexual, is about 300 lbs and covered with a skin disease.  He claims, &#8220;I have no problem with gays, as long as they stay away from me&#8221;.  Don&rsquo;t worry, bubba, it&rsquo;s not going to happen. Many of you here have the same irrational fear as he does. If you knew anything about gays, you wouldn&rsquo;t worry. Many just want to work, survive, and have some kind of life&hellip;they have no physical interest in you.</p>
<p>By they way, most pedophiles do not have an adult sexual identity. The very few who do are mostly heterosexual. Father Porter, who molested hundreds of boys and girls, was eventually married to a woman. He hated homosexuals/gays. That is common. The vast majority of studies done over the years prove this. Do an internet search, if you are disagree or are concerned. Also, if you have a daughter or niece, you will notice plenty of weirdos staring at her. I have to clutch my daughter&rsquo;s hand like a vice grip, whenever we are at the train station. I often notice perverted freaks staring at her. Does that mean every heterosexual man is a predator or pedophile? I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>

		<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_X_of_Denmark" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>:<br>
<p><br>
<p><br>
On November 22, 1942 The Washington Post published a photograph of Christian X; calling him, ironically, a victim of Hitler. The idea was to show that Denmark was not opposing Nazism. It became then important for Danish Americans to prove the contrary, and a number of stories were invented in the turmoil of the war. The most successful of these were the <b>legend of the king wearing the yellow star in order to support the Jews. </b>. The story became extremely well-known through its retelling in Leon Uris&rsquo;s 1958 novel of the founding of Israel, Exodus and the film. Many people still believe it, but it is not a true story. The facts are, that the yellow badge was never introduced in Denmark, and when the Jews were finally arrested there is no record of a protest from the king (though he had earlier made his opinion that &#8220;one Dane is as good as another&#8221; quite clear). </p></p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve known many gays as a doctor working in the San Francisco Bay area in the past.  Many were as you say, just normal people looking to live some kind of normal life.  This is true of men.  Lesbians are typically hateful towards males.  See, male homosexuals LIKE men, whereas Lesbians hate men, yet the &#8220;butch&#8221; dominant ones act out their interpretation of the worst male attributes.  Women&rsquo;s Weekends in a West Sonoma town well known as a gay resort, would not allow any female to even bring a male baby into their compounds, so great is the hatred of males.  Those same weekends also saw the Sheriff department overwhelming with policing the numerous fights over girlfriends and other drunken mayhem of the lesbians.  </p>
<p>The gay men are far different.  They usually have a great sense of humor, even making fun of themselves.  Even so, I must put in that even the males typically engage in risky behaviors and often have hard break ups.  You may not have appealed to them, but I can tell you from my own experience that ever since I was 16, gay men have hit on me.  When I was 20 and traveling across the country, I got hit up by gays every where I went.  They seemed to be waiting at every train and bus station.  As a doctor, gay men came to me because of the attraction factor, I am convinced.  Most of them always wanted a hug.  More than one asked me &#8220;out.&#8221;  In one memorable case, a very wealthy gay man proposed to me.  He had AIDS, so I guess he felt okay about dragging me to death with him.  Still, I was good friends with several, who attracted me with their intellects, great senses of humor,and courtesy in general.  The greatest one of all was a bisexual cowboy from Wyoming who was hilarious and showed great personal courage while he died of AIDS. I&rsquo;m not kidding, I used to refer to myself as queer-bait, even though I haven&rsquo;t got a gay bone in me.</p>

		<p>I agree with Mr. Weissberg&rsquo;s assessment.  As I stated in a previous post, I was a teacher in New York City who was fired in 1996.  My point was that I was in a hostile environment for two reasons:  1)  The State was going to take over the School, so the Board of Ed created a hostile environment to turn over the staff; and, 2)  Education in general is an environment hostile to conservative and libertarian ideas.  The persecution was palbable, and the Stockholm Syndrome took hold of all of the fighting groups of people in the school.<br>
To put this in something more resembling Mr. Weissberg&rsquo;s context, what I see is a Culture of Nihilism where the traditional morality dies out with the old guard, and what was once perverse now becomes sacred and vice-versa.  Simone de Beauviour, in her book &#8220;The Ethics Of Ambiguity,&#8221; written in the 1950s, I believe, looked forward to a day when &#8220;crimes against the individual won&rsquo;t matter as much as crimes against the collective,&#8221; as an example.  Think of Mick Jagger singing &#8220;Sympathy For The Devil.&#8221;<br>
But what I cannot formulate into a hypothesis yet is HOW this nihilism gets started, WHAT are its phases, what phase we are in now, and WHAT is the END-GAME.  This is of the utmost importance:  The Left knows how to agit-prop.  They are expert at it.  We traditional people had better come up with a program to counteract their evil, or we will be defeated  &mdash;  -and forgotten.</p>

		<p>@32 - &#8220;Gays are &hellip; typically physically fit &hellip;&#8221;  Once in a while AR posts HIV data. You find very different results for gays, in a bad way, than for straights; especially with black men. Something very different is going on among gays and blacks. The debate is whether this is innate or the result of a prejudiced society. Both are involved but I insist that the innate portion is large. </p>
<p>I also raise concern about the effect of gays on straight values. The gay lifestyle is usually very different than that of straight families. Including both within the same institution is bound to dilute the power of it, like marriage. Who is more important here anyway, families raising their children of gays?</p>
<p>Anyway, a famous psychology professor in California says whites will set aside issues about gays in the interests of racial solidarity. So I&rsquo;ll go along with that. </p>

		<p>Psst, there are still some of us in education.</p>
<p>The young white people are not all falling for their indoctrination.</p>
<p>A female student complained to me about her racist grandfather(guardian)  one day. &#8220;He says to stay away from black guys, he&rsquo;s so racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I quietly told her, &#8220;You didn&rsquo;t hear this from me, but I say the same thing to my daughter. You do know about the STD risk and the nine times greater risk of violence, don&rsquo;t you? He just loves you and wants you to be safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes got real big. She was shocked that I didn&rsquo;t give her the PC party line.</p>
<p>That was all I said. Never another word about it.<br>
I overheard her about a week later warning another girl about being a &#8220;snicker-licker.&#8221; I never heard that term in my life.</p>
<p>The way I see it, part of my job as a teacher is to back parents up. As a parent myself, that&rsquo;s what I would want.</p>
<p>If I did not know the parent was concerned I would have said NOTHING. I have no desire for martyrdom. Talk to your kids. <br>
If you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t expect anyone else to.</p>
<p>I ain&rsquo;t building a bridge to nowhere.<br>

<p>1 - &#8220;Many of you here have the same irrational fear as he does.&#8221;.  Such fear may well be irrational in the case of your 300lb, skin diseased good friend, but I have been involved in the legal proceedings which concerned a gay who committed overt sexual assault against another male. So, the fear is of being sexually assaulted, similar I would think to the fear any woman may have of being sexually assaulted by any male. I do not see where such fear is irrational for most people, especially given the added-humiliation that ensues when pursuing justice via our legal system.  Otherwise, I believe those here on AMREN who view differences between the races is justified based upon long-term, documented evidence, whereas your condemnation of &#8220;Many of you here&hellip;&#8221;, is based upon your own ill-informed, anti-White-male prejudice.</p>
<p>2 - As to your last comment: &#8220;Also, if you have a daughter or niece, you will notice plenty of weirdos staring at her. I have to clutch my daughter&rsquo;s hand like a vice grip, whenever we are at the train station. I often notice perverted freaks staring at her.

Well, heaven forbid. Granted, I would wonder about any such person if they should make any unusual advance or should they being to salivate in public, but for heterosexual males, the switch for the sexual thought process is, for the most part, always &#8220;on&#8221; so to speak.  It may at times be in the background, but it isn&rsquo;t something that can be turned off. For men to view women, even those who are young, to me seems quite normal. Extended gawking is out of place, but I question your use of the descriptors as again, it appears you hold a bias against White males.</p>

<p>and taking into consideration previously reported mean numbers of victims per offender group, the ratio of heterosexual to homosexual pedophiles was calculated to be approximately 11:1. </p>
<p>This suggests that the resulting proportion of true pedophiles among persons with a homosexual erotic development is greater than that in persons who develop heterosexually. <br>

&#8220;It is convenient for SODOMY ADVOCATES to blame a &#8216;culture of secrecy&rsquo; on the molestation of hundreds of boys at the hands of homosexual priests, but the truth is obvious to any rational person: A man who molests a preteen or teenage boy is engaging IN homosexual behavior. To say that he is a &#8216;pedophile&rsquo; and not a homosexual is thoroughly dishonest.</p>
<p>If members of the media wish to cover this story accurately, they should stop using the term &#8216;pedophile&rsquo; to describe priests who molest teen-agers, because &#8216;pedophile&rsquo; (in legal and clinical terms) refers to a person who is fixated on having sexual relations with boys or girls younger than 13 years old. A pedophile priest is engaging in homosexual behavior just as a priest who sodomizes a teen-age boy is engaged in homosexual assault. You can&rsquo;t separate homosexuality from the horrid conduct of these priests.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Not all gays molest adolescent males. But (next to) all adolescents molested were males. THEREFORE, it IS a homosexual issue. It is also not really pedophilia, but rather the quite common homosexual desire for young men taken to a more extreme level (not illegal in most EU countries though, where the age of consent is usually 14, sometimes 12). Youth is the MOST important draw in the gay community.&#8221;<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;Homosexual activists routinely claim that most child molesters are &#8216;heterosexual&rsquo; males, thus shifting the focus away from their own very high rates of molestation. Since 98-99% of the population is heterosexual, it is technically correct to say that most molestations are done by heterosexuals. However, statistics indicate that homosexuals pose a far more serious threat to children than do heterosexuals&hellip;</p>
<p>For example: In 1987&hellip; a ten-state study of sex abuse cases involving school teachers [found that] 32 percent of those child molestation cases involved homosexuals. Nearly a third of these cases come from only 1-2% of the population.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is no doubt that liberal poison has infected our society at every level. Our nation has degenerated incredibly since the 1960s. Moral relativism has wreaked havoc in our republic. There will never be any real progress in dealing with racial issues until we all face reality. It&rsquo;s amazing to me how many whites are terrified to speak the truth, other than in private with trusted family members or friends!</p>

Jackson, Sharpton and others of their ilk are fading. Voters may get intimidated in Philly during one election due to the surprise element but won&rsquo;t be for long.

		<p>I hesitate to say this for it might not be understood, yet those who understand comprehend the totality of what I will write&hellip;</p>
<p>The very fact that the topic of *homosexuality* is being discussed here with regard to the topic of this article is in essence why pride in Caucasian heritage has become a non-issue in America.</p>
<p>The topic should provoke a discussion about why it is necessary  to create solidarity among *white people* of the earth.</p>
<p>The writer of this article is using homosexuality as a mere point of comparison.  Did the writer intend his audience to use his article as a tool for discussing the pros and cons of homosexuality? Did he wish his audience to take precious time to argue for or against the rights of homosexuals? How individual *feel* about homosexuals?</p>
<p>It has always been the intent of those determined to destroy the so-called white race concept&hellip; to fragment it in as many ways as possible.  </p>
<p>To get caught up in the snars of *discussion* over as many topics as possible.</p>
<p>It does not matter if we accept homosexuality or not.  </p>
<p>It is a non-issue to cause fraction between the men and women of the white race.  </p>
<p>It is a tool for friction, fragmentation among the men and women of the white race&hellip;another tool to keep us at each others throats&hellip;to divide us.</p>
<p>Talk about the insight the article provides for the possibilities of unification for the men and women of the white race&hellip;it can be fun to talk about abortion, gun control, religious persecution, race crimes against whites as long as we do not allow ourselves too much energy discussing our individual *views* on those topics because all those topics have already been chosen for us as vehicles to use to divide the white race, confuse us, cause us to argue among ourselves over a non-issue rather then use our energy to come up with viable ways in which to unify the white race&hellip;before we are all dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be optimistic. Perhaps in time &ldquo;white nationalists&rdquo; and &ldquo;racists&rdquo; will be able to hold teaching jobs. Some day they may even be able to marry, and their engagements will be prominently featured in the New York Times. And, naturally, people will be shocked to see how many of them come out of the closet.&#8221; </p>
<p>Dr. Weissberg </p>
<p>It will be a long cruel season before this happens&hellip;many will have to die, even as they are being targeted and dying now at the hands of those who hate white people&hellip;who are intent upon the total destruction of the  VALIDITY of the *white race*&hellip;indeed, we already know it has been determined that we must be erased from the face of the earth.  We have been watching it happen to us for decades&hellip;beware the effects of the *non-issues*&hellip;</p>

No, you are dead wrong my friend. Whites have not been defeated, they are not being defeated and they will not be defeated. If you have any education you will know that whites excell in those areas that the problems are the toughest! Today whites are victims of injustice and repression there is no disputing this. But it is a mistake to imagine this will lead to extinction of whites. If it does then those who are advocating racial equality, indeed racial inferiority of whites would be proven right!<br>
The climate in which we are living today will awaken our survival instincts. View this as an opportunity for growth. Defeat is simply not an option for the whites. It is just a phase in our development and we will overcome it in the end.<br>
&gt;&gt; 29<br>
I agree with you. And may I add that getting into racial comparison is perhaps the only thing that can shake a white nationalist&rsquo;s self assertiveness. In one of amren articles I noted how misinformed people praised Sikhs for defending &#8220;territories&#8221; that they have &#8220;conquered&#8221; from the British in London! They praised Sikhs for being generally peaceful. Honestly I do not want to insult any racial group but my experiences in the middle east have proved to me that Asians and middleeasterns might show a very different temperament when they are met in large numbers. During world war ii people in the West were amazed when they witnessed unbelievable largescale attrocities and brutalities of the Japanese whom they had come to view as quiet and civilized. Again I am not here to insult any racial group but I want to point out that apparent temperaments and IQ scores and school grades cannot be relied on to justify replcing whites with nonwhites. Asians can get as many straight A&rsquo;s in Asia as they please, but their supposed smartness is nothing to be excited about, nor is it ever going to replace white creativity.<br>
&gt;&gt; 32<br>
I strongly disagree with you. You should go out more often. For one thing my experience shows that homosexual men show a very strong reaction when in the presence of young and teenage boys. I am sure you fail to see the implications of this. This unwanted attention is, psychologically, very different from the unwanted attention that girls receive. A young girl will eventually have to choose to respond with these attentions, with discretion of course, and this attention will develope into a strong bond and bring a lot of happiness to her. A homosexual attention that a boy reveives is a completely different story and will leave a psychological scar and also unreconcilable hostility. I have lived in societies in which homosexuality is traditionally widespread to such an extent that it is taken for granted that all male in those societies are bisexual. People there are as worried for their boys as they are for their girls even more! It is very difficult for young men to work without accepting some degree of malestation. Needless to say this lowers the moral and the little productivity they might have had.<br>
&gt;&gt; 36<br>
The program you are talking about is exactly what we are doing now. Whites are by nature peaceful and respectful of all those who walk on two legs. Today the whites are beginning to learn how to live among radically different people and still preserve their identity even though they are banned from expressing themselves. Sure there are those whites who are suckes into the pop culture, drugs, or interracial relationships but I hardly miss their company as they were not proud of their identity in the first place. If there is one opportunity to improve white race I believe this is it.<br>
&gt;&gt; 38<br>
Organizations are for those who cannot think for themselves and have to be provided with a fictional agenda. Do you need an organization to help you breath? Or eat? Preserving white heritage does not need an organization. It is part of being white. White heritage is not fictional. It is the drawing your child makes, it is her or his creativity. We do not need to shoot people or mug them to prove who we are. We do not need peaceful demonstrations to prove who we are. The intellectual food like what amren is providing us with certainly plays a crucial role in informing us.<br>
The whole world depends on the white race for its existance. That is our identity and it is very tangible.<br>
&gt;&gt; 42<br>
Sure, children can always use good guidance especially when they are so overwhelmed with antiwhite propaganda, they might feel hopeless and submit to selfdestruction. Giving them hope will obviously help to keep them confident. Most whites are able to fully figure this out by themselves and they are intelligent enough to avoid circumstances that are degrading to their heritage. If this understanding is lacking in some whites, I strongly doubt they could contribute to the white race in any serious manner, so we are not really losing them.</p>

I can see that all of us have estimated correctly the scale of the problem and the perils the white race faces today. However it is a mistake to suppose every single white individual can contribute to the fight for our survival. Do you want a bunch of drunk rabble on our side? I agree with you that some issues are given undue significance in order to distract us from vital issue. But I does not necessarly need to be a bad thing. The racial awareness must be integrated into our core thinking first. We must view and analyse and talk about everything with the interest of the white race as out fundamental concern. In that case talking and discussing anything and every thing contributed positively to our cause. We are not isolating groups or fragmenting the white race. Homosexuals are infact a tiny percentage of the white race while in some other racial groups they are indeed the majority. I would rather see white homosexuals rather than nonwhite homosexuals. Taking your point to the extreme, I personaly would prefer to have white criminals in white societies rather than nonwhite criminals because then we would have fewer criminals overall! You see, with the race at the top of our priorities, every issue will look different from what it is made to be. But still when we talk about white homosexuals that shows people are, if anything, paying a lot of attention to the conditions of this group, notice people citing HIV statistics. No one suggested we should pillory homosexuals nor we should deal with homosexuals of other racial groups. We show concern for white homosexuals and that is why we talk about them! This is part of our unity.</p>

<p>-Good idea, and partly right about worrying about how they will be perceived. I&rsquo;d say more to the point, they are worrying about keeping their jobs. And another problem- most are simply too busy with work and with being responsible parents to have time to spend on political organizations.

		<p>To those who argue that anti-homosexual statements divide whites:<br>
The homosexual agenda divides itself from most whites by supporting  &mdash;  and, in many cases, driving  &mdash;  the agenda of the far left.  Prominent homosexuals often condemn religion, traditional values, and Southern culture.  They are an intricate part of the anti-white left that espouses that all whites are racists and blameworthy for all the troubles of non-whites.  <br>
I&rsquo;m aware that not all homosexuals think this way, but, if not, they need to be more vocal in opposing this radical agenda.</p>

		<p>Mr Weissberg&rsquo;s comments would have more force, and would be more rational, if he would not have tried to make us have sympathy with that most unnamable of perversions, homosexuality.</p>
<p>This site has been dedicated to an honest discussion of race, a thing quite refreshing in these days of cowardly discourse, but judging by some of the responses (inspired by Mr Weissberg&rsquo;s apparent symapthy for homosexuals) our society is even worse off than even I thought.  That someone could speak so calmly about sodomy is simply beyond my comprehension, and, worse, the apparent acceptance of it by some, even readers of this site, is terrifying.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr Weissberg and some of those who have responded do not read the newspapers.  Apparently they are unaware of the fact that the Catholic Church has been suffering from an infestation of homosexuals into its priesthood unprecedented in its entire 2,000 year history.  And what is the result of that infestation?  Mr Weissberg would probably be shocked to learn that the buggering of adolescent boys by male sodomites is the result because, as Mr Weissberg doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand, homosexuals prey on adolescent boys.  Seven thousand years of recorded history on this point hasn&rsquo;t seemed to penetrate his thinking.</p>
<p>If we are going to face the real problems of racial difficulties, let us face them square on and not try to bring in our own personal hobby-horse.  And if we are going to talk honestly about homosexual perversion, let us stop raping that perfectly innocent word &#8220;gay&#8221; when describing these pitiful wretches.  There is nothing gay, as Joe Sobran famously said, about one man placing his generative organ into another man&rsquo;s execratory one.</p>
<p>Advice to Mr Weissberg: just stae the facts and leave your prejudices to yourself.    </p>

<p>You obviously know very little about Alfred Kinsey. He was (and is) one of the most widely respected individuals in the field of sexuality. Long afterhis death in 1956, there have been many panels and tributes to his legacy. In fact, Indiana University established The Kinsey Institute in his honor. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if anonymous has a &#8220;gay agneda&#8221; or not, but I do know that your opinions of the late Dr.Kinsey are very misguided. </p>

The links you provide are from a foundation established during the 1980s by the Reagan administration in their supposed &#8220;war on pornography.&#8221; Many of these people it turned out were adulterers, alcoholics, sexist, bigots, xenophobes, closet gays, anti-semites and sexual perverts themselves. They hired Juidth Reisman, a jewish woman herself in an effort to deflect any charges of anti-semitism.</p>

		<p>Some time yesterday at Atlantic Cape Community College in S. Jersey a Black employee in his sixties leaving for home was walking through the campus when he saw a Black male ( apparently a &#8220;bawfrain&#8221; of a &#8220;student there) playing with a golf cart used by the grounds crew. He advised the &#8220;Youf&#8221; not to touch it whereupon the Mau Mau hit him and then flung him to the ground so hard that he hit his head and is now on life support and not expected to survive. <br>
The victim was a long time employee who was planning to retire. It just never ends.<br>
An elderly White man was beaten into a coma two weeks ago while walking home from a restaurant in AC in the early morning hours. The &#8220;youf&#8221; who was one of a group frequently seen hanging out on a corner drinking and smoking, first hit the elderly man with a shopping cart and when he fell proceeded to kick him in the head repeatedly. He was taken to a hospital where he died a few days later.</p>

No, you are dead wrong my friend. Whites have not been defeated, they are not being defeated and they will not be defeated. If you have any education you will know that whites excell in those areas that the problems are the toughest! Today whites are victims of injustice and repression there is no disputing this. But it is a mistake to imagine this will lead to extinction of whites. If it does then those who are advocating racial equality, indeed racial inferiority of whites would be proven right!<br>
The climate in which we are living today will awaken our survival instincts. View this as an opportunity for growth. Defeat is simply not an option for the whites. It is just a phase in our development and we will overcome it in the end.<br>
&gt;&gt; 29<br>
I agree with you. And may I add that getting into racial comparison is perhaps the only thing that can shake a white nationalist&rsquo;s self assertiveness. In one of amren articles I noted how misinformed people praised Sikhs for defending &ldquo;territories&rdquo; that they have &ldquo;conquered&rdquo; from the British in London! They praised Sikhs for being generally peaceful. Honestly I do not want to insult any racial group but my experiences in the middle east have proved to me that Asians and middleeasterns might show a very different temperament when they are met in large numbers. During world war ii people in the West were amazed when they witnessed unbelievable largescale attrocities and brutalities of the Japanese whom they had come to view as quiet and civilized. Again I am not here to insult any racial group but I want to point out that apparent temperaments and IQ scores and school grades cannot be relied on to justify replcing whites with nonwhites. Asians can get as many straight A&rsquo;s in Asia as they please, but their supposed smartness is nothing to be excited about, nor is it ever going to replace white creativity.<br>
&gt;&gt; 32<br>
I strongly disagree with you. You should go out more often. For one thing my experience shows that homosexual men show a very strong reaction when in the presence of young and teenage boys. I am sure you fail to see the implications of this. This unwanted attention is, psychologically, very different from the unwanted attention that girls receive. A young girl will eventually have to choose to respond with these attentions, with discretion of course, and this attention will develope into a strong bond and bring a lot of happiness to her. A homosexual attention that a boy reveives is a completely different story and will leave a psychological scar and also unreconcilable hostility. I have lived in societies in which homosexuality is traditionally widespread to such an extent that it is taken for granted that all male in those societies are bisexual. People there are as worried for their boys as they are for their girls even more! It is very difficult for young men to work without accepting some degree of malestation. Needless to say this lowers the moral and the little productivity they might have had.<br>
&gt;&gt; 36<br>
The program you are talking about is exactly what we are doing now. Whites are by nature peaceful and respectful of all those who walk on two legs. Today the whites are beginning to learn how to live among radically different people and still preserve their identity even though they are banned from expressing themselves. Sure there are those whites who are suckes into the pop culture, drugs, or interracial relationships but I hardly miss their company as they were not proud of their identity in the first place. If there is one opportunity to improve white race I believe this is it.<br>
&gt;&gt; 38<br>
Organizations are for those who cannot think for themselves and have to be provided with a fictional agenda. Do you need an organization to help you breath? Or eat? Preserving white heritage does not need an organization. It is part of being white. White heritage is not fictional. It is the drawing your child makes, it is her or his creativity. We do not need to shoot people or mug them to prove who we are. We do not need peaceful demonstrations to prove who we are. The intellectual food like what amren is providing us with certainly plays a crucial role in informing us.<br>
The whole world depends on the white race for its existance. That is our identity and it is very tangible.<br>
&gt;&gt; 42<br>
Sure, children can always use good guidance especially when they are so overwhelmed with antiwhite propaganda, they might feel hopeless and submit to selfdestruction. Giving them hope will obviously help to keep them confident. Most whites are able to fully figure this out by themselves and they are intelligent enough to avoid circumstances that are degrading to their heritage. If this understanding is lacking in some whites, I strongly doubt they could contribute to the white race in any serious manner, so we are not really losing them.</p>

I am intimately familiar with the middle eastern cultures and can speak their language, having lived among them and observed them for a long time. In the middle east men are considered to be bisexual as a rule. There are of course exceptions, theoretically. The literature of Persia is filled with pederasty. Young men are seduced by older men and as they grow up they become predators themselves, according to the customs. In the old literature of Persia this homosexual relationship is exalted and given a very romantic colour. Islam has no role in this development and it is still a prominant sexual preference even with the ready availability of the opposite sex. Turks are also considered bisexual as a rule. To the East, Afghans are actually renowned for their bisexuality and they even consider it as a source of great pride. There is an Afghan poetic verse in which this homosexuality is depicted as the greatest &#8220;knowledge&#8221; and &#8220;taste&#8221; of Afghans living in Kabul. Turks are very active homosexuals and their pederasty is taken for granted. Boys with white skin are considered a great &#8220;prize&#8221; and their families live in constant terror of their malestation. I am not exagerating in anyway and I didn&rsquo;t want to name spesific racial groups. People in the middle eastern cultures are traditionally incredibly rude and use very graphic and almost always violant language when they talk about sex, especially homosexual activities. They might show some reserve when communicating in western languages but their native languages are traditionally much more robust when it comes to sexual matters, sodomy, oral sex and above all sadism.</p>

<p>Did you watch the youtube video?  It is a KNOWN fact that Kinsey was a sexual and LIED about all his &#8220;findings and research&#8221;..He was a sick disgusting human being.  </p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t care about those who discredit those who disagree about Kinsey. I guess you think that these &#8220;scholars&#8221; are really reputable and don&rsquo;t have their own agendas? Same with scientists.  They usually have their own agendas, just as homosexual have their agendas. Remember when mental health experts &#8220;changed&#8221; their stance on homosexuality? They used to say it was a mental health problem. Then all of a sudden, lo and behold, they got rid of that old fashioned idea. Right? Gee, I wonder why that was.</p>
<p> BTW, WHO and What discredited what I linked? There is much credited documentation on Kinsey and his fraudulent &#8220;studies&#8221;. As for &#8220;sex therapists&#8221; they aren&rsquo;t any better. They are just filling peoples heads with false information and making $$$$ off their own stupidity.</p>
<p>The sex industry (including the homosexual industry) is nothing but an attack on Christianity and the moral values most hold dear. This country was NEVER formed for, nor built by the Kinsey&rsquo;s of this world. Thank God!</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a Christian to have the common sense of knowing what is a lie.</p>

I apologise if my comment sounded insulting to those concerned whites who want to activily be involved in organized movements against the repression of the white race. What I meant was that in practice such organizations will be quickly demonized and their members identified and persecuted. Martyrdom is not an answer to our urgent problems. It might do some good in the shape of awakening the whites against the evil of antiwhite forces but it is not an answer in itself. I am myself a white man with extensive cross-cultural experience with knowledge of both eastern and western languages and cultures. My experience proves that nonwhites need to be &#8220;assimilated&#8221; into an organization in order to function and they lack those white qualities that makes white people individualist thinkers. I have also witnessed the hostility and racism of nonwhites and their readiness to harm white people. So if people are worried that they might loose their jobs or feel threatened, it does not mean they cannot contribute to the prowhite movement just because they are not cardholder of a prowhite organization. There is no excuse for average whites not to show support for the future of the white race when they find a safe opportunity.</p>

I have no idea what you mean. I am not old enough to remember what things really were like in 19th century Britain but I can read the literature of that period. I remeber I once came across a &#8220;history&#8221; book published by Routledge with a lot of information on incest in 19th century Britain, giving the impression that incest was a widespread practice! Never had much faith in these &#8220;scholarly&#8221; works.</p>

		<p>#79, I think of different levels of pro-white involvement. First there is implicit whiteness such as Republican, NASCAR, Christian, country music. Next up, one can get involved in immigration reform through organizations like FAIR or Numbers USA which are not pro-white but well worth supporting by whites. Next, one can be paleo-conservative and support Pat Buchanan and his group. These levels are things whites can do without getting into trouble.</p>
<p>If a person can&rsquo;t be explicitly pro-white like joining AmRen, maybe do it through grandma or some other family member who is independent. If she agrees, sign up granny to a bunch of organizations. It does sound funny but camouflage is needed sometimes in life. This just points out the extra responsibility independent/wealthy whites should assume for the many whites who have to remain under cover.</p>
<p>At one time gays were in the closet. Now it&rsquo;s whites&rsquo; turn. </p>

Poster #76 says,</p>
<p>It is VERY IRRESPONSIBLE to equate all gay men with pedophiles. In fact, statistics indicate that the majority of pedophiles are heterosexual men who molest young girls. The homophobia of some of our posters is alarming.<br>

<p>Can&rsquo;t you read? There is plenty of evidence to the contrary&hellip; Pedophiles are mostly gay men! You know as well as anyone that homosexuals just &ldquo;love&rdquo; little boys and they even have a NAME for it. NAMBLA! Do you see such an organization for heterosexual men? </p>

Your post is pure NONSENSE! There is no such evidence of gays being pedophiles any more than non gays! Get over your homophobia! </p>

<p>What is your definition of &#8220;White&#8221;&hellip;One with white &#8220;skin&#8221;? If so, I suggest Joshua, that your comment is insanely foolish and that you do more research on homosexuality.</p>

<p>Really? Guess you haven&rsquo;t read all the  well documented research.  What is the PER RATIO of the gay population to the heterosexual population? There are FAR more gays who are pedophiles in their (what, 3% or 5%), of the population than in the heterosexual population, PER RATIO.</p>
<p>Gee, you have to name call someone a &#8220;homophobe&#8221;? </p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t you heard those who have to resort to slurs, etc. have already lost the argument. Sorry, you lose.</p>

Correction: in 1955 there was no significant opposition to gay marriage, because the idea of gay marriage was simply unthinkable. For 6,000 years of recorded human history (and probably for a half-million unrecorded years before that), it was unthinkable. Even as recently as the mid-1970&rsquo;s, in the film Dog Day Afternoon, the idea of a man calling another man his &#8216;wife&rsquo; is thrust at the audience suddenly for humourous purposes. I saw the film in the theatre on its first release remember the audience bursting out in surprised laughter. </p>

		<p>This article would really be more appropriately titled, &#8220;Pro-Whites are the New Queers.&#8221; Anyone that expresses pro-white sentiment of any variety - be he a &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; or not - is considered a threat to society as queers were 50 years ago.</p>
