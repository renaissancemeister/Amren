			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Allison Steele and Mike Newall, Philadelphia Inquirer, August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man who crossed paths with a group of teenagers Friday afternoon in Old City ended up in the hospital with broken teeth and a wired jaw after the youths attacked him at Fourth and Walnut Streets.</p>
<p>Seven hours later, a crowd of young people cut a path of destruction through several Center City blocks, assaulting four other men, apparently at random, and leaving one unconscious and bleeding from the head. Of the four people arrested in those attacks, one is an 11-year-old boy.</p>
<p>On Monday, city officials promised to come down hard on anyone caught committing such acts of violence. They also said they were developing a &#8220;coordinated response&#8221; to deal with random youth attacks, a problem for more than a year despite increased patrols and a shift toward stricter punishments for offenders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Police Department on Monday also announced the launch of SafeCam, an online program that allows residents and businesses to register their security cameras with the city, to help police apprehend suspects quickly.</p>
<p>For police, the problem of so-called flash mobs or &#8220;wilding&#8221; youths has proved frustrating. The city gained national attention last year for stories about large packs of teenagers tearing down sidewalks, knocking over pedestrians, fighting, and vandalizing the Macy&rsquo;s store in Center City.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the most recent attacks, a 36-year-old man was jumped by a group of youths at Fourth and Walnut about 2 p.m. Friday. According to one witness, who asked not to be identified, the man walked by a group of teenagers who suddenly began punching and kicking him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The man was taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital with jaw and tooth injuries, police said.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the afternoon attack had any connection to the later violence. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About 9 p.m., teenagers swarmed the sidewalk near 15th and Sansom Streets and punched a 33-year-old man in the face. An 11-year-old boy tried to grab the man&rsquo;s bag, according to a police report, but was not successful.</p>
<p>As the teens ran toward Walnut Street, police said, they punched another man they passed, knocking him to the ground. {snip}</p>
<p>The mob then ran to Locust Street, where it descended on another person. One attacker snatched a wallet and cellphone from the victim and held it in the air as others in the group tried to snatch it away, witnesses said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can all get your own cellphone on the next person we get,&#8221; the teen told his friends, according to a police report.</p>
<p>At Juniper Street and Walnut, the group surrounded a 59-year-old man, punched and kicked him unconscious, and left him in the street, bleeding from the head. The teenagers fled as police arrived, but officers caught four of them, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Saturday, Raymond Gatling, 19, and three juveniles, ages 11, 16, and 17, were charged with conspiracy, aggravated assault, and recklessly endangering another person. {snip}</p>

		<p>Pennsylvania has a very good concealed carry permit law.  Philadelphia does NOT.<br/>
In fact, Philadelphia refuses to recognize the State permit and continues to declare Philly a gun free city.  Gee.  I wonder if there is any correlation between the arrogance of Philly&rsquo;s &#8220;youths&#8221; and the fact they can be assured that anybody they beat down randomly will NOT be allowed to exercise his State right to carry in the &#8220;City of Brotherly Love&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Gee, we are really sorry to hear that the black Freedmen are running wild and dangerous up there in Philly.  </p>
<p>Sounds like somebody named Lincoln made a serious miscalculation back in 1863.</p>
<p>In honor of Thaddeus Stevens, Pennsylvania Representative, Occupier and Reconstructor of the defeated and prostrate South, we urge these &#8220;urban teens,&#8221; these &#8220;black youth,&#8221; these &#8220;oppressed, marginalized, vulnerable, and at risk young African Americans,&#8221; these who &#8220;struggle against systemic bias and institutional racism,&#8221; these &#8220;for whom the American Dream has been too long delayed,&#8221; these who are &#8220;victims of our unearned and racist White privilege,&#8221; these who &#8220;have brought the blessings of Diversity into our lives with their contributions of vibrant and authentic culture,&#8221; these for whom &#8220;we have more work to do,&#8221; we urge you to please, please, please just keep on keep&rsquo;n it real.</p>
<p>Every time you make life miserable for those who &#8220;saved the Union and freed a race,&#8221; those who shouted &#8220;the battle cry of freedom&#8221; while they &#8220;crushed the Rebellion,&#8221; you vindicate and acquit our Rebel ancestors.</p>
<p>Thank you, and please keep up the good work!<br/>

		<p>While the details are the usual - sneak punching to the face, then kicking once the victim is on the ground -, the big difference this time is that the black punks were CAUGHT.  This is the perfect opportunity to punish them severely for their behavior, to send a message.  Put them away for many years, please, and end any welfare payments to their families (i.e. young mothers).</p>

		<p>Lawless blacks now believe they can act with impunity.  One of their brothers is the Attorney General, and he&rsquo;s made it abundantly clear that blacks are free to commit hate crimes against whites.  The black President makes no comment whatsoever concerning the epidemic of black-on-white violence that has besieged major cities.  <br/>
Give these people an inch, and they will attempt to take a mile.  After the slaves were freed, after civil rights passage, and now after the election of a black Prez, they believe they have the green light to get back at whitey.  And the violence will surely escalate until a severe crackdown occurs.  <br/>
Obama is now worried that he won&rsquo;t again receive the huge turnout of blacks he did in 2008.  Criticism of his actions is becoming louder among black commentators, and polls show support among blacks dropping.  As he does in many matters, he&rsquo;s trying to ride the fence and say nothing.  <br/>
Hopefully, there will be an enormous turnout of white voters and a large police presence, which usually scares many ghetto blacks away.</p>

		<p>Now, there is going to be a lot of enraged talk here about how these wilding persons should all be arrested and spend lots of time in prison, because that is where criminals belong.  Wrong.  Wilding youth are not criminals.  They are insurgents.  Think about it.  </p>

		<p> There will come a tipping point with all this violence. The question is, when? I am truly ashamed of white response to this. The white dominated media purposely ignores and diminishes the level of violence. Most of the victims are quick to diminish the racial angle, even when racial epithets are thrown. Many &#8220;feel badly&#8221; for the poor misguided youth that just stomped thier faces in. It is truly disgusting.<br/>
 Im a white guy and I want to stomp thier weak liberal skulls. </p>

		<p>This is just a glimpse of the future. When the economy hits the skids, you can expect more of this kind of behavior. Note that they are &#8216;youths&rsquo; or &#8216;teenagers&rsquo;&hellip; every YouTube video of flash robberies show groups of black kids smiling and laughing while they steal and trash everything in their path. They are the Id in action and no one is holding them accountable or will. Once the police try to restore order it&rsquo;ll be &#8220;racial profiling&#8221; etc. etc. etc&hellip; seen this movie before.</p>

		<p>If the africans put the same amount of planning and effort into cleaning up their ghettos and helping out in their communities what a wonderful world it would be.  But apparently those pursuits hold no interest for the african mentality.  As ever its all about senseless crime, violence and stupidity.  What a truly worthless species they are.  And it never ceases to amaze me how they continue to find new ways to globally distinguish themselves as the Earths most valueless &#8220;human citizens.&#8221;  Give them access to technology and they turn in into a weapon of mass criminality. They will claim a few rotten apples doesn&rsquo;t spoil the barrel but a barrel 90% filled with rotten apples does, which is the unfortunate truth.</p>

		<p>I am totally disgusted at the way these attacks are being covered in the media, and also how it is being addressed by government, authorities, etc. Can you imagine if groups of white youths were roaming the streets, attacking innocent minorities? This country would be turned upside down. It&rsquo;s time to call a duck, a duck.  I have given my family box cutters (which are legal to carry) just in case, a group of &#8220;misguided youths&#8221; notice the pale color of our skin. I refuse to be the next &#8220;random victim&#8221; I strongly suggest that we ensure that we can protect ourselves, since they authorities seem to be more concerned with racial profiling, than for our physical safety.  Meeting fire with fire, might just save your life, and will send a much needed message to these punks.    </p>

		<p>What we have is a nationwide low level black guerilla war against white people.  Most whites in Philadelphia are more concerned with stories about the black players on the Eagles football team than they are about the danger that whites face.  Hoiw else could the whites in Philadelphia vote for Obama?</p>
<p>The Philadelphia news media is mainly concerned with find naive people who tell them that they are not afraid to visit Center City.  The safety of white people is of no concern to the media.</p>

		<p><i>Wilding youth are not criminals. They are insurgents. Think about it.</i></p>
<p>Are you Maxine Waters?</p>
<p>I gave it a nano-second of thought like you asked and here is my conclusion:</p>
<p>You are wrong.  These wilding youth are violent mindless criminals looking to &#8220;jack&#8221; whatever they can as far as loot, booty, gold chains, rimz, booze, potato chips and cash.  The definition of insurgent is <i>a rebel of revolutionary</i></p>
<p>Those with sub 100 IQs as revolutionaries?  Ha Ha! </p>
<p>Do you think they planning to &#8220;take over&#8221; the government?</p>
<p>And uneducated, black rioters as rebels?  Against what?  A White America that has lavished them with money, rights and privileges over their own children?  An America that has promoted them beyond their abilities, allowed them entry into colleges and corporations where they have no business, given them every chance possible to succeed (as far as one with an IQ of 80 can possibly succeed)?  Allowed them to attack whites with impunity while claiming they are &#8220;victims of oppressions and institutional racism?&#8221;  </p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s mindless violence, particularly violence aimed at whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up to My Neck in California&#8221; has the ONLY viable solution:</p>
<p>The ONLY thing that will stop these wildings is deadly force wielded by average citizens.  It is a given that the PO-lice won&rsquo;t come to our rescue, especially if the force is majority &#8220;of color.&#8221; The ONLY solution, as Up to My Neck wrote, is to allow everyone to carry arms and respond to these attacks with the violence necessary to stop them.  These pea brains will get the message quickly that whites will not be victimized by violent blacks.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t let this pass:</p>
<p><i>Obama is now worried that he won&rsquo;t again receive the huge turnout of blacks he did in 2008. Criticism of his actions is becoming louder among black commentators, and polls show support among blacks dropping. As he does in many matters, he&rsquo;s trying to ride the fence and say nothing.</i></p>
<p>Obama is worried about no such thing!  His handlers well know that voting (for non-whites, that is) breaks along racial lines.  Those &#8220;loud&#8221; activists and &#8220;commentators&#8221; and &#8220;polls&#8221; are nothing but garbage.  NO black will vote for a white candidate over a black candidate, ever   &mdash;   and this includes Tom Sowell and Clarence Thomas. </p>
<p>Would that we whites would do the same thing!</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to read all the &#8220;they were good church going boys!&#8221; and &#8220;my son wouldnt hurt a fly!&#8221; comments from the black single mothers.  A measure of satisfaction which, while it might be slightly petty, will no doubt feel oh so sweet.</p>

		<p>4th and Walnut is (or used to be) prime real estate  &mdash;  Society Hill/tourist attraction. Time for Philly to be off the conventioneers&rsquo; destiinations for a while&hellip;..let Philly pols and cops figure it out: when revenues fall, no one sitting at outdoor cafes, no one wandering down to South Street, then there might be some action taken. Many parts of Philadelphia have never been a treat, but 4th and Walnut/Chestnut/Spruce etc. were always okay!</p>

		<p>Philly is the next Detroit. The percentage of blacks is rising in Philly (as opposed to many other big cities). This, of course, brings the usual jump in crime, drugs, flash mobs, vandalism, property damage, gang attacks ..etc.</p>
<p>The black Philly leadership is just like the &#8220;leadership&#8221; of Coleman Young - the openly racist black mayor who destroyed Detroit.</p>

		<p>Abraham Lincoln confronted pioneers of the flash mob. It seems these pioneers accomplished this even before granted civil right of tax payer subsidized cell phone&rsquo;s . (Do not be confused by author&rsquo;s use of the term &#8220;black men&#8221; instead of corrected term &#8220;teens&#8221; in use by Today&rsquo;s modern media.)</p>
<p>&#8220;1828 - On January 20th, his married sister, Sarah, dies while giving birth. In April, Abe, now 19, and Allen Gentry take a flatboat containing a cargo of farm produce to New Orleans. During the trip they fight off a robbery attack by seven black men. &#8220;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania has a very good concealed carry permit law. Philadelphia does NOT.<br/>
In fact, Philadelphia refuses to recognize the State permit and continues to declare Philly a gun free city. Gee. I wonder if there is any correlation between the arrogance of Philly&rsquo;s &ldquo;youths&rdquo; and the fact they can be assured that anybody they beat down randomly will NOT be allowed to exercise his State right to carry in the &ldquo;City of Brotherly Love&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is irrelevant.  Blacks will act this way whatever the gun laws are.  They are not afraid of guns.  They have guns too and if they think the victim is armed, they will shoot first and then rob the corpse.  </p>
<p>Bringing up gun laws in these cases is a distraction from the real issue:  race.  It&rsquo;s bad enough that mainstream conservatives are always trying to avoid discussing race, we don&rsquo;t need that kind of thinking here too.  </p>

		<p>In their stories about the black flash mobs and black-on-white wildings that are an ongoing occurrence in American cities, the liberal media conscientiously exclude any reference to race, by speaking blandly of the violent mobs as &ldquo;teens&rdquo; and &ldquo;youths&rdquo; instead of as &ldquo;black teens,&rdquo; &ldquo;black youths,&rdquo; or (heaven forbid) &ldquo;black flash mobs&rdquo; (see previous entry). But at least one black publication, UhuruNews.com, an organ of the International People&rsquo;s Democratic Uhuru Movement (InPDUM), has had it with the white liberals&rsquo; euphemisms. In fact, they seem to be offended that the &ldquo;white ruling class media&rdquo; conceal the blackness of the flash mobs &mdash; mobs that, from InPDUM&rsquo;s point of view, are not doing anything wrong but are simply demanding justice from an oppressive white system.</p>
<p>African youth in Philadelphia threaten to shut city down &mdash; InPDUM demands hands off the so-called &ldquo;flash mobs&rdquo; (African youth)<br/>
UhuruNews<br/>
Published Mar 26, 2010</p>
<p>Philadelphia, PA &mdash; Since February there have been occurrences of what the white ruling class media are calling &ldquo;flash mobs.&rdquo; In reality they are gatherings of young African people, male and female, who have come together to demonstrate their rejection of neocolonialist authority and rule.</p>
<p>First it was in Center City. Then it happened on South Street.</p>
<p>These large groups of African youth are actually rising up, coming together to show their unity and resistance against a city that attacks African people.</p>
<p>Reports state these defiant youths are organized primarily through cell phone text messaging, Facebook, Twitter and other social networks. One message sent travels through thousands of cell phones &mdash; resulting in thousands of African youth converging on a central location in the city.</p>
<p>The last gathering that occurred on South Street &mdash; a gentrified section of South Philly &mdash; had the white people too scared to leave the trendy restaurants they were dining in. [LA replies: So Uhuru.com acknowledges that the blacks were terrorizing whites.] The city has responded to these uprisings with arrests of dozens of young Africans and a media campaign to criminalize all African youth, thus the term flash mobs.</p>
<p>But every black person in this country knows that the term mob refers to the gangsters in Chicago and Philadelphia or white lynch mobs who have historically and continue to terrorize our people. [LA replies: The author seems to have forgotten that in the previous paragraph he said that blacks were behaving in ways that made whites afraid to walk on the street.]</p>
<p>Currently 11 African teenagers have been wrongfully convicted of rioting and given sentences ranging from probation to imprisonment in a juvenile prison. [LA replies: Of course, from the African perspective, no African is ever rightfully convicted of a crime.]</p>
<p>Youth uprisings trying to achieve consciousness &mdash; response to Philadelphia war on African community</p>
<p>One article in the Philadelphia Daily News reported that the Africans who stormed on South Street were chanting &ldquo;Burn the city down!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black boys! Black boys!&rdquo; During the February 16th near rebellion in front of the Macy&rsquo;s department store, Africans started throwing all sorts of objects at the police.</p>
<p>It is clear that young Africans as a whole are resisting the oppressive conditions being imposed on our community by the real flash mob &mdash; City Hall. The contradictions between the government and the African community is growing sharper by the day &mdash; as Africans continue to have no confidence and no respect for a system that only can imprison them and shoot them down in the streets. No jobs and no future is the reality in this present system.</p>
<p>On May 5, 2008, three young African men were stopped and viciously beaten by a gang of at least nine police. The beating looked like the one Rodney King received before the African community rose up in rebellion demanding justice.</p>
<p>The entire world saw the beating on a FOX News video camera. However, in July 2009, a grand jury investigation under former district attorney Lynn Abraham found that the cops who beat these brothers did not commit any crime!</p>
<p>Now, the American Arbitration Association has announced that the pigs who brutalized these brothers are going to get their jobs back &mdash; with back pay!</p>
<p>That is just one of many examples of the terror against African people being funded by the City of Philadelphia. However, everywhere we go in Philly Africans are faced with poverty, police brutality and powerlessness.</p>
<p>The city spends 25 percent ($1.1 billion) of its budget on police, prisons and courts that keep Africans separated from our resources.</p>
<p>Only 7 percent ($300 million) is spent on education. That funding which does go towards education is spent on a school system that is anti-African. Our youth are taught white nationalist curriculum and attacked by police, faculty and staff.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there is no economic development. Fifty percent of African youth are unemployed and students have no job market to look forward to after graduation. The only option is the illegitimate drug economy which the government uses as a means of trapping the masses in prison. Forty percent of the African community lives in poverty.</p>
<p>It is not just the government that participates in our oppression and exploitation however. Parasites like Macy&rsquo;s and the stores on South Street, the targets of the outrage, take resources from the African community everyday but they don&rsquo;t do anything for the community. This blood sucking relationship is the real crime in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The war on African youth is a war on the African community</p>
<p>The State is using our youth as an excuse to criminalize African people the same way it uses &ldquo;the war on terror&rdquo; as an excuse to invade Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>While he portrays African youth as a threat to the public&rsquo;s safety, Philadelphia police chief Charles Ramsey makes announcements to intensify the police presence in the city. However, Ramsey had nothing to say when the white people tore up South Street after the Phillies won the World Series, or when the white boys got drunk on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and ran wild through Center City.</p>
<p>If Charles Ramsey, Michael Nutter, Seth Williams and the black judge who sentenced the young Africans involved in the February 11 police attack represented the black community&rsquo;s interests they would prosecute the real flash mobs: the police who murder, brutalize and violate the rights of African people and the city administration that steals African resources.</p>
<p>The fact is that the white man put these thugs in office as part of a strategy to convince Africans that the government is helping us by locking up our youth. As long as the black community thinks these forces represent power then we won&rsquo;t demand real black power. Black power is when the African working class achieves the ability to be self-governing &mdash; in control of our own government.</p>
<p>Only revolutionary organization will fulfill true purpose of youth resistance</p>
<p>The State fears large groups of Africans gathering because it is only a matter of time before these gatherings become politically conscious of their power and aspirations. This is why the youth are starting to resist. We must not unite with the government&rsquo;s attack on us.</p>
<p>Philadelphia InPDUM leader Diop Olugbala conducting outreach on South Street to organize the youth for black power.</p>
<p>The International People&rsquo;s Democratic Uhuru Movement has been on the ground in Philly struggling to forward the Revolutionary National Democratic Program (RNDP) calling for reparations and independence for African people.</p>
<p>We support the African youth disobedience to a criminal government. We believe Africans have a right to resist. We also believe that the uprisings will only realize their full significance when they are fighting for the self-determination for the African community.</p>
<p>At the same time, InPDUM will only reach its full significance when we have successfully organized the masses of Africans in their own interests. Only when the masses are organized to take power we will solve the problem.</p>
<p>We are calling on these same young Africans to reach their full potential as freedom fighters by joining InPDUM and fighting for the following demands derived from our RNDP:</p>
<p>1. Hands off the Philly African youth gatherings: drop all trumped-up charges against those Africans rounded up in the Center City and South Street incidents.</p>
<p>2. Reparations to the African community: $1.1 billion for community-controlled education, housing and economic development &mdash; not police containment.</p>

 The attitude by this newspaper only encourages this sort of behavior. If the media would crack down on these thugs as they do on Michele Bachmann these creeps would be pressured by their communities to knock it off. It&rsquo;s almost as if these newspaper ghouls want this sort of behavior to continue.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Wilding&#8221; is not a real word.  When the central park jogger was raped in the late 80&rsquo;s, the &#8220;youths&#8221; who were attacking people in the park told the police that they were &#8220;wilin&rsquo;&#8221;   &mdash;   a slang word meaning &#8220;going wild,&#8221; but not specifically referring to assaulting people but rather general crazy behavior.  The clueless morons in the media kept repeating this term   &mdash;   pronounced in an inappropriately proper way   &mdash;   as if this was a common term on the street.</p>
