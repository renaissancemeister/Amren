			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sheena Goodyear, CNews, August 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A U.S. woman has launched a class-action lawsuit against her former high school for racial discrimination after students there celebrated &#8216;Wednesday Wigger Day&rsquo; during the school&rsquo;s spirit week.</p>
<p>While the event was not officially sanctioned, the lawsuit alleged it was widely practiced and that authorities were well aware of it.</p>
<p>The lawsuit describes the term &#8216;wigger&rsquo; as &#8220;a pejorative slang term for a white person who emulates the mannerisms, language and fashions associated with African-American culture.&#8221; It&rsquo;s meant as a portmanteau of the words &#8216;white&rsquo; and the pejorative term for black people, &#8216;n  &mdash;    &mdash;  -.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quera Pruitt, a young black woman, attended Red Wing High School in Minneapolis, Minn., between 2008 and 2009. During that time, the school council held an annual spirit week, where students would don costumes based on specific themes. Sept. 30 was officially called &#8216;Tropical Day&rsquo;, but the student population called it Wigger Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The students who participated in Wigger or Wangsta Day wore clothes that, from their perspective, mimicked black culture. These costumes included oversized sports jerseys, low-slung pants, baseball hats cocked to the side, and &#8216;doo rags&rsquo; on their heads. Some of the students displayed gang signs,&#8221; reads the lawsuit filed on July 29.</p>

		<p>A black female student once WON several thousand dollars because a few white students,in the year book, put together an anti black sentence that was broken into about four pieces, each part was written into the names of the white students final comments. One would have to look VERY CLOSELY to notice it.</p>

		<p>It might be instructive to look at Tinker vs. DesMoine Independent Community School District, the 1968 Supreme Court case dealing with students wearing black armbands protesting the Viet Nam War and the school authority prohibition thereof.  There, by a 7-2 margin, the court stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order for the State in the person of school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint. Certainly where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in the forbidden conduct would &lsquo;materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,&rsquo; the prohibition cannot be sustained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One could easily argue that the &ldquo;Wigger Day&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wangsta Day&rdquo; participants at Red Wing HS were engaged in expressive conduct.</p>

		<p>First of all, why is Queera complaining three years after the fact? The time to cash in on this racial justice lottery is long gone. She who hesitates is lost. But also, there was no discrimination or harassment. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then these White kids were acknowledging the superiority of black culture, and Queera should have felt a tribute was being paid to her. </p>
<p>You simply can&rsquo;t please blacks; they&rsquo;re going to feel insulted or inferior no matter what one does. </p>

<p>1.  Like &#8220;the N word&#8221;  wigger is a word that only whites should be able to say.  Whites can say it and no others!  It is racist if others say it.   </p>

		<p>Interesting story, but confusing. Is she suing on behalf of the White kids who are ensnared in the rap culture, or is she suing because of the White kids ensnared in the rap culture? In a demented.& twisted way, if she sues for the Whites she will be labeled a &#8220;sell out&#8221; by her own community. But if she sues to strike back at those same White kids who imitate this black subculture, she will be branded as a racist by those same White kids will wonder why it&rsquo;s okay for her to wear clothes conducive to black subculture, but they can&rsquo;t. Well White kids&hellip; This at one time WAS a free country. </p>

<p>Encourage whites to celebrate black culture and when they do, condemn them as racists.</p>

		<p>So lets see, a black guy actually acting &#8220;ghetto&#8221;, no problem for blacks, but a white guy acting ghetto becomes a traumatic experience for blacks. And of course the PC Nazis at the SPLC have their big noses stuck in this, gee how much money are they getting out of this? </p>

		<p>I would like to chalk this up as a prank, but unfortunately too many white adolescents willingly adopt this W-word culture in their real day-to-day persona.  The schools and the popular dominant culture have made black &#8220;cool,&#8221; so acting black is what all the cool kids do.</p>

		<p>Pruitt says she suffered from depression and loss of sleep, and was forced to quit a number of school activities. For her, school was a &#8220;hostile environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then go back to your ghetto school &#8220;Quera&#8221;! Nobody is making you stay there! This is typical of blacks - they &#8216;bully&rsquo; their way into a White environment, then immediately start the &#8220;day all be racisss up in here&#8221; nonsense and start demanding &#8216;changes&rsquo;. If its that bad, why do they never leave! Thousands of White kids are physically assaulted at black schools and have been run out of those schools and Quera &#8216;ghetto lottery&rsquo; Pruitt is &#8220;depressed&#8221; about a wigger day!</p>
<p>This wigger day gets me depressed also, but in a very different way, can I sue too?    </p>

		<p>I can remember just 13 years ago in middle school. I was one of a dozen or so people who dressed up in blackface and grass skirts for Halloween. Not a conservative kind of place, definitely not very liberal either. No one said a thing. Amazing how sensitive we&rsquo;ve (they&rsquo;ve)become.</p>

		<p>Where I live, there are lots of wiggers.  I&rsquo;m talking the hard core, think-they&rsquo;re-gangstas&rsquo; types.  It is sad to see.  I just want to slap them, they act so dumb.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered what the parents think about this.  One can imagine what conversations go on in the home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now junior, you were in the church choir, used to be an &#8220;A&#8221; student, and used to have hobbies.  Now you&rsquo;re runnin&rsquo; with snoopy dogg and little wayne, wearing a cap sideways and showing your boxers to the world.  What happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>You certainly should sue. White kids often jokingly (but not usually to make fun of blacks) adopt mannerism of vibrant persons of color. They do it because they feel adopting these words or mannerisms will allow them to also intimidate whites and hold the moral high ground. Negative behavior has been elevated to the highest position. Those who do right are being physically and then also morally intimidated.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea! Black students could have an &#8220;Uncle Tom Day&#8221;. They could wear their pants hiked up around their waist, speak in coherent sentences, and actually pay attention in class. And they&hellip; What? Aaahh, you&rsquo;re right.

		<p>I must admit, this is pretty funny! </p>
<p>This is the first time I&rsquo;ve heard of having a lawsuit over an informal spirit day theme. Unless the judge is really crazy, she won&rsquo;t win. </p>
<p>Maybe the plaintiff should think about what this says about her culture. If the black students had arrived in polo shirts and canary dresses, I doubt anyone would have been ashamed to link it with their own culture.</p>

		<p>Red Wing is the home of Red Wing shoes. It lies on the Mississippi River, and is largely white, blue-collar, regular people who go to church, shop locally, maybe have a brewski, and hunt in the autumn, and snowmobile in the depths of winter.</p>
<p>All of which are demographics AT ODDS with any non-white&hellip;. period!<br>
When I last was in RW, I was ASTOUNDED to see &#8216;persons of color&rsquo; - even a Muslim Somali (everywhere- they are blasted everywhere). It was then that I realized that there is a CONSCIOUS EFFORT to INFILTRATE ALL AREAS of white majority, to &#8216;diversify&rsquo; the population, with NO CONSIDERATION for the White, Anglo-Saxon Christian&rsquo;s already residing in these areas!!</p>
<p>It is merely the &#8216;vanguard action&rsquo; of the social engineers, acting as a &#8216;fifth column&rsquo; for the [eventual, planned, and orchestrated] Genocide of the White Race. This woman is merely a prop in the Kulturkampf. It would behoove the city to stand firm. We just did it to Liberal Gov. Dayton,&hellip;. and look what WHite Republicans can do, if we aren&rsquo;t swayed by appeals to &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; but think first and foremost of OUR OWN interests! As it should be&hellip;..</p>

<p>Certainly no one cares if you dress up a person of color in the movies as white. It&rsquo;s quite the norm for black comedians to speak as if they are white during part of their routine in order to make a joke. It&rsquo;s practically their routine. It&rsquo;s fighting against stereo-types, don&rsquo;t you know. </p>

		<p>To the Moderator:</p>
<p>You completely misunderstood my post.</p>
<p>First of all, when I said, &ldquo;<i><b>These people</b> have no problem using the word w****r, but censoring the word n****r.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;These people&rsquo; (and the next sentence) were referring to the ORIGINAL article, NOT AmRen&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
<p>Secondly (as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before endlessly on here), I&rsquo;ve been on this site since way before you went interactive and have had a subscription to the hard copy of AR since almost the beginning. I&rsquo;ve promoted this site to more people than I could ever count. I&rsquo;ve sent Jared&rsquo;s books to him directly to be autographed and sent back to my address. Continuing with my &lsquo;bona fides&rsquo; would be superfluous, so I&rsquo;ll leave it at that. The point is, you&rsquo;re attacking the wrong person.</p>
<p>Third - I&rsquo;m 100% fully aware of what Jared Taylor - and others - have gone through and continue to go through because of their public positions and how they are publicly ostracized. And for that, I respect all of them immensely and always have. However, I have unfortunately, lost one job in the past where I made the same positions known publicly and I do not intend to lose another. I&rsquo;ve always posted under this UserID. (At one point in the past on here, I was mistaken for another Mike B., who I believe spoke at one of your bi-annual conferences. I corrected that mistake on your board as soon as I saw it.) To the best of my knowledge, I&rsquo;m the only poster who has ever used this UserID, <i>except</i> once, a long time ago. When I saw it, I posted a comment below his, asking him not to use the same UserID and I let people know that wasn&rsquo;t me. If someone else has used it since then, I haven&rsquo;t personally seen it - but <i>if</i> there was and I happened to have seen it, I would&rsquo;ve posted the same, aforementioned message to him.</p>
<p>Fourth - and most importantly - you mistook the tone of my post. I was <b>agreeing</b> with your standards, NOT disagreeing with them:<br>
&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve always respected and understood AmRen&rsquo;s credos:</i>&rdquo;<br>
When I said, &ldquo;<i>just for the hell of it.</i>&rdquo;, I didn&rsquo;t mean I would actually DO it (and I <b>never have</b>). I meant that it would be TEMPTING to do it. All people are tempted to do something at one point or another in their lives, but most people don&rsquo;t because we like to think of ourselves as civilized, but after we take a deep breath, we don&rsquo;t act out on our temptations. (Well, <b>some</b> people do, but they&rsquo;re usually the subjects of AmRen&rsquo;s articles and comments.)</p>
