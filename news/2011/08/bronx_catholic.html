			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corinne Lestch, NY Daily News, August 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The principal of a Bronx Catholic school was fired Tuesday after the <em>Daily News</em> exposed his ties to a white supremacist group and his controversial writings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank Borzellieri has been relieved of his position as principal of Our Lady of Mount Carmel School,&#8221; said Joe Zwilling, spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York. </p>
<p>&#8220;This decision was reached following a thorough internal review of his opinions and beliefs as expressed in his books and columns, and a discussion with Mr. Borzellieri himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 48-year-old, who was named principal at the mostly black and Latino school two years ago, had pushed in the past to ban a biography of martyred civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King.</p>
<p>He wrote a 2004 book which maintained &#8220;diversity is a weakness,&#8221; and was a frequent contributor to the white supremacist publication <em>American Renaissance</em>.</p>
<p>As a Queens school board member, he tried to bar &#8220;anti-American&#8221; literature  &mdash;  including the King book  &mdash;  from school libraries and remove a gay teacher from the classroom.</p>
<p>Zwilling said the opinions expressed by Borzellieri in his writings &#8220;were found to be incompatible with the philosophy and practices&#8221; of the school and the archdiocese.</p>

		<p>And what about the black supremacist whitey hating racist Leonard Jeffries, who gloated about the 1986 Space Shuttle Disaster, because now Whitey cannot spread his Filth through the Universe?  Why didn&rsquo;t he lose his job, which is with the PUBLIC school system? Why didn&rsquo;t this publication say anything about that comment? The double standard just keeps getting worse, not better.  Decent New Yorkers should begin an immediate boycott of this publication.</p>

		<p>Ah, racist &#8220;ties.&#8221;  Almost anyone can be covered.  If I said &#8220;hi&#8221; to Jared Taylor, conceivably that could qualify as a &#8220;connection&#8221; to a Hate Group.  Eek.  </p>
<p>So much for academic freedom, by the way, including within the Catholic Church. </p>

		<p>I just had a history professor who was also one of the heads of the NAACP. In his class, he told us that the Greeks stole all their knowledge from Black philosophers, and that it was these blacks who really created Western Civilization. When I&rsquo;d complained about it, I was told &#8220;You don&rsquo;t have to agree with somebody politically to learn from them.&#8221; I was told to &#8220;Shut-up.&#8221; and perhaps I&rsquo;d learn from the man. Go look at the Huffpo message boards, or the NY Daily News  boards, and see how many people are willing to be so charitable to Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s beliefs, and educational offerings. It is also notable that there hasn&rsquo;t been a single complaint about his job performance.    </p>

<p>EVERY person and EVERY race is racist. It is hardwired into our DNA. FOR A REASON! Survival of one&rsquo;s own racial line.</p>
<p>But, it is only the nonwhite races that has the privilege of being vocal about it and to promote their own racial interests, WHY?  Because we, Whites, let them get away with it while demonizing ourselves for even feeling racist! </p>

		<p>The comments section of this article are just incredible, or incredulous I should say. The few trying to defend Mr. Borzellieri are being called worse things than this man ever said. I&rsquo;ll bet half of them have never read a thing he wrote, or ever heard a word he&rsquo;s said about racial issues.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to Jared Taylor when the last AR conference was cancelled in Charlotte. The newspapers and news sites here were full of comments from ignorant posters who admitted they had never heard of Mr. Taylor or AR, but were quick to call him names and condemn him. The difference was, those fools were outnumbered at least 4 to 1 by people who like myself spent hours and even days on these sites defending AR and Mr. Taylor.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t respond to the one guy who has posted stats and spoke the cold hard truth defending Mr. Borzellieri, and when they do, it&rsquo;s just more typical name calling and insults they resort to when they can&rsquo;t counter an argument with any kind of intelligent debate. Of course, what are they left with&hellip; really?</p>

		<p>It really is a new state-sponsored religion. This one teaches that those who believe that man was created in God&rsquo;s image are &lsquo;rednecks&rsquo; (the unwashed) and that those who believe that man was formed by the environments of their ancestors are &lsquo;racists&rsquo; (the heretics).</p>
<p>The Believers teach us that evolution in man magically stopped 30,000 years ago, with the exception of outward physical appearances as these are too hard to deny. And like all good state-sponsored religions, the unwashed must be shunned and the heretics must be silenced. For now this silencing is limited to economic boycotts. Best of luck to Mr. Borzellieri.</p>

		<p>The only thing about Borzellieri&rsquo;s viewpoints and writings was that so many people silently agreed with his positions. </p>
<p>This is another case of the politically correct enforcing their ideology on everyone else. It is totally hypocritical of the Catholic Church officials in New York to claim that no one knew about Borzellieri&rsquo;s books and articles. He was probably doing a good job as the school principal, but the weaklings chose to throw him under the bus rather than to be accused of racism. </p>
<p>Prepare yourselves, in the run up to 2012, the left will be playing the race card more and more often.</p>

		<p>It seems like the right to prefer your own race needs to be included in human rights laws. Add an amendment to the constitution. That would guarantee that these actions by the RCC would end up in official government courts. Does the church want that? Government rulings over church affairs? Try this one on; government licenses for priests. That should give extra protection to boys. Please explain why you don&rsquo;t want government licensing for priests.  </p>

<p>Leonard Jeffries once taught that black genes have been augmented by the value system of the sun, and that white people are &#8220;ice people, dirty, dastardly, devilish, devious, diabolical folks&#8221; Jeffries probably thinks school books need to focus more on African Americans (of course, not on any bad things about them), while Borzellieri seems to feel these books are too Afrocentric and anti-white already. If one were to believe in an objective reality, only one of these two men can be right.  </p>

<p>That very phrase says that the White race wants to control and rule over the other races (nonwhites). WN&rsquo;s do not want any such thing. They don&rsquo;t want to be ruled over by over races!</p>
<p>WE want to be FREE in our OWN lands, free FROM people of color and control our own racial destiny. We don&rsquo;t care how the nonwhites rule themselves or live, as long as it is IN THEIR OWN LANDS. It is called White survival and controlling our own destiny, not letting other races control it for us. We have seen how that has worked out, haven&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>Just in case y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t know, the Catholic Church has jumped onto the &#8220;social justice&#8221; bandwagon with both feet and their hands too.  In other words, the Church has turned from a staunch anti-marxist organization to a pro-marxist one.  I just found out that my own priest (who has since been reassigned to a church even more prestigious than ours, which is pretty high up) was HIDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS in housing that was supposed to be designated for priests.  Obviously he was rewarded for that bit of illegal activity.  So, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that this principal was fired.  The Church is now so pro-liberal and PC that it would fit right in in ANY Communist country.  I don&rsquo;t give them money any more - they don&rsquo;t deserve any of mine.</p>
