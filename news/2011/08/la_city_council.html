<p>  &mdash;  QD</p>
<p>La Raza will NEVER rest as long as there are Whites to shake down!!  May 5th is the large drunken holiday, Cinco De La Raza  (all White Angelenos KNOW to stay off the roads that day) and September contains LA&rsquo;s MOST important holiday:  mexican independence day!!</p>
<p>Last year there was a huge parade in September for Mexican Independence Day, down (what else?) Cesar Chavez Blvd. (formerly Sunset Blvd.), featuring Mayor VivaLaRaza and Jerry Brown.  No English allowed!!  This, in the same city that called off the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade in perpetuity due to a lack of funds. </p>
<p>Yet, LA somehow found the $$$ to send City Councilman Cardenas&rsquo;s sister and brother-in-law to Mexico to exhibit low- rider cars at a cost of $50,370!</p>
<p><i>The City of Los Angeles is home to at least 1.6 million immigrants or 40% of the population.   August is immigrant pride month.</i></p>
<p>Los Angeles is an impoverished Mexican outpost!!  How much do these destitute immigrants cost LA?  Add it up!! ALL of it   &mdash;     $600 million for welfare and food stamps; $500 million for public safety (mostly jail) $500 million for health care.  That is $1.6 billion per year not including the billions spend futilely trying to educate illegal immigrant children and anchor babies.</p>
<p>Or as Walter Moore puts it:  While you are laboring to pay taxes that go straight to illegal immigrants, the illegals are laboring in hospitals to pump out more welfare ATMs that you fund.</p>
<p>Yeah, why would I want to leave California?  Why would I want to go to a place without a Car Tax, a State Income Tax, lower property taxes, lower sales taxes, lower utiltiy fees, and no state gains/inheritance taxes?   What would I do with the extra $$$$?</p>
<p>SOMEONE has to pay for EBT cards so mexicans can eat out at fast food joints and drive with impunity on our highways drunk, without insurance, a license or registration while Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck makes sure his officers do not tow the cars of illegal immigrant drivers just because they don&rsquo;t have driver&rsquo;s licenses.  Chief Beck, making LA safer, said: &#8220;it&rsquo;s the right thing to do!&#8221;  </p>
<p>When/if I do leave the Beholden State, I won&rsquo;t bother to turn off the lights   &mdash;  in fact, on my way out I plan to throw the switch on every light and electrical vampire I can find and open up every water spigot full blast.</p>
<p>The question is this:  where would I go?  The entire country seems to be the &#8220;New LA&#8221;, there&rsquo;s NO escaping!!</p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>That being said, I&rsquo;m all for declaring a moratorium on immigration, and let in extreme cases  &mdash;  like Boers getting out of South Africa.  Then after the dust settles, go back to a pre-1965 policy.</p>

		<p>I was born in Los Angeles and have lived here all my life.  It&rsquo;s true the place is loaded with immigrants - in fact my parents immigrated here after the second world war.  But I would argue that these immigrants maintain the enormous wealth generated by those lucky enough or smart enough to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Los Angeles is an impoverished Mexican outpost&#8221;  Hardly.  If Los Angeles were a country it would be the 16th largest economy in the world.  I live in a modest neighborhood in the heart of it all - where the average home price is 1.2 million.  Los Angeles has the 2nd highest number of millionaires in the country who call this place their home. Not really the picture of destitution some people want to believe.  <br>
  <br>
The sense of devastation felt by many whites is irrational.  In fact, I would attribute most of white bitterness to an inability to compete.  As manufacturing jobs left the county, the easy money was not to be found. Enter the entrepreneurial immigrant; the Korean store owner, the Latino produce vendor, the Chinese restaurant owner etc&hellip;  These people work 16-18 hours a day, 6 days a week, if not 7. These people add to the economy by paying rent, eating food, and buying gas etc&hellip; The wealth of Los Angeles is generated not by overfed white collar workers in search of a comfortable desk job, but by business owners and landlords who need  a growing population, even an illegal one, to sustain them. </p>
<p>In addition, there is an enormous amount of family wealth that has been generated and passed on to subsequent generations through real estate.  As one drives through Los Angeles, each apartment, office building, medical complex etc. represents a family who is continuously profiting from one of the largest real estate developments in the world - backed by an ever increasing population of immigrants. </p>
<p>As for the cost?  Let&rsquo;s work with the number of a previous comment:  There are 1.6 million illegals who receive 1.6 billion of services.  I don&rsquo;t know if these numbers are accurate but let&rsquo;s assume they are.  1.6 billion divided by 1.6 million is $1,000.00 annually per immigrant.</p>
<p>If an immigrant receives $1000.00, it is likely they spend much more than that in their community.  For example, if a person receives food stamps, they spend it in their grocery store. The owner of the store pays employees, property taxes, rent, utilities etc. At the end of the day food stamps are in fact a government subsidy to grocery stores, restaurants, and their landlords. Any other money an immigrant has goes to rent, gas, utilities - expenditures which benefit the asset owning class of society.</p>
<p>I can understand how many whites feel left out. But most of them were looking for the safe haven of a secure,risk free,life-time job. Now that those jobs have evaporated, this same segment of society feels undermined and displaced. I have come to the conclusion that those who feel left out of the economy of Los Angeles never took the risks to be apart of it, and are not beneficiaries of it.</p>
<p>Those of you who feel that immigrants are a plague are not fortunate enough to receive an income from them.  Those of us who benefit from an immigrant community do completely understand the value which they represent.</p>
<p>Immigrants will continue coming to this country and they are not going to leave.  Doesn&rsquo;t it make more sense to become a beneficiary of this phenomenon rather than a frustrated victim who does not know where to go?</p>

		<p>SloppyVomit, your comment is a pile of sloppy vomit.  The rich foreigners you praise are making money off the backs of poor foreigners.  And thanks to having &#8220;protected status,&#8221; no native dares to confront their slave mongering unless they want to be branded &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be leaving L.A. in less than a month.  You can keep this &#8220;immigrant&#8221; paradise all to yourself.  I&rsquo;ll have a good belly laugh when California crumbles into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>White inability to compete? </p>
<p>Compete with hoards of low IQd, uneducated immigrants for 10/hour jobs?   &mdash;    jobs that used to pay a lot more before immigrants flooded into California?  Yeah, right. </p>
<p><i>Few if any new jobs are created that require only a high school degree or less, yet most immigrants are either high school dropouts or have a high school education.</i> </p>
<p>As for high-paying jobs,  Whites are being pushed out, not left out, by greedy companies that hire lower-paid, lower quality H-1b visa holders from Asia.  Don&rsquo;t tell me these Asians are necessary.  We Whites put a man on the moon and invented the modern world without any help from Asians.</p>
<p>Here is a list of companies ruined or almost ruined by low-quality H-1b holders: Comment #13:  https://goo.gl/weoGg</p>
<p><i>But most of them were looking for the safe haven of a secure,risk free,life-time job.</i></p>
<p>Nope. Immigrants, legal and illegal, are looking for Free White Money. This will become increasingly difficult as California&rsquo;s tax base continues to shrink.</p>
<p><i>In cash-strapped California, higher taxes have just stifled the private sector, motivated corporations to leave and strangled job growth. The economic pain is not shared equally. While private-sector workers have lost over a million California jobs since the recession began, California government employment has increased by 1,200 jobs.</i></p>
<p><i>California now has more a million fewer taxpayers, many of whom have seen their incomes compromised.</i></p>
<p><br>
<i>These people add to the economy by paying rent, eating food, and buying gas etc&hellip; </i></p>
<p>These types of activities do not grow the economy.  Immigrants, legal and illegal take out FAR more than they put into the system, not including the FACT that many work under the table for cash and then collect fat benefits on top of it!:</p>
<p><i>Thanks to a careful and exhaustive research report by Steve Camarota, Director of Research at the Center for Immigration  Studies, entitled &#8216;Immigrants in the United States, 2007: A profile of America&rsquo;s Foreign-Born Population&rsquo; we learn that</i></p>
<p><i>Of adult immigrants, 31 percent have not completed high school, compared to 8 percent of natives. Since 2000, immigration increased the number of workers without a high school diploma by 14 percent, and all other workers by 3 percent.</i></p>
<p><i>The proportion of immigrant-headed households using at least one major welfare program is 33 percent, compared to 19 percent for native households.</i></p>
<p><i>The poverty rate for immigrants and their U.S.-born children (under 18) is 17 percent, nearly 50 percent higher than the rate for natives and their children.</i></p>
<p><i>34 percent of immigrants lack health insurance, compared to 13 percent of natives. Immigrants and their U.S.-born children account for 71 percent of the increase in the uninsured since 1989.</i></p>
<p>If California&rsquo;s economy were thriving and California offered a &#8220;wonderful, educated, &#8216;diverse&rsquo; workforce&#8221; why are businesses fleeing the state instead of rushing in to set up business here?</p>
<p>Dateline June 2011:</p>
<p><i>Companies are leaving the &#8216;Golden State&rsquo; in record numbers this year. In just the last two years, the number of companies leaving California has accelerated more than five-fold, from one per week in 2009 to 5.4 per week this year, according to California relocation expert Joe Vranich.</i></p>
<p><i>The state of California is becoming legendary for creating the most anti-business climate in the country because of its high taxes, excessive regulations, forced unionism, and bloated public sector.</i></p>
<p>Here are a few of the &#8220;joys&#8221; dirt poor, uneducated, low IQd immigrants have brought to Southern California:</p>
<p>*Carnage from uninsured, unlicensed, drunk drivers on our highways.</p>
<p>*Gangs, the vast majority of which are composed of hispanics, many illegal:</p>
<p><i>A substantial percentage of young illegal immigrants end up in gangs.  U.S. authorities say that there are now over 1 million members of criminal gangs operating inside the United States. According to federal statistics, these 1 million gang members are responsible for up to 80% of the violent crimes committed in the U.S. each year.  Latino gangs made up primarily of illegal aliens are responsible for much of this violence&hellip;According to the Center for Immigration Studies, some of the most notorious gangs in the country are made up almost entirely of illegal immigrants&hellip;.</i></p>
<p>*Hospital closures   &mdash;   84 so far as hispanics use emergency rooms as primary care<br>
 <br>
California now ranks dead last out of all 50 states in the number of emergency rooms per million people.</p>
<p>*Ruined schools that are mandated to provide bi-lingual services to illegal immigrants:</p>
<p><i>The larger educational gap in California is caused primarily by the high concentration of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, who tend to have much lower levels of educational attainment than other immigrant groups.</i></p>
<p><i>This high concentration of low-education immigrants in the state has supplied California&rsquo;s businesses with a large pool of unskilled labor. Few if any new jobs are created that require only a high school degree or less, yet most immigrants are either high school dropouts or have a high school education.</i> </p>
<p>There is also the quality of life issue as California&rsquo;s is deteriorating every year.  </p>
