<h1>Are Flash Mobs Abrogating the Treaty?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Kay, American Renaissance, August 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Twitter and Facebook aside, groups of young blacks who violently harass whites and Asians (&#8220;flash mobs&#8221;) are hardly new. In the 1960s this was called &#8220;wilding,&#8221; and for over a decade New York City subways (and probably much public transportation elsewhere) became almost unusable thanks to black teenagers who moved from car to car terrorizing hapless white riders. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, today&rsquo;s flash mobs (for a listing of attacks, see <a href="http://violentflashmobs.com/">http://violentflashmobs.com/</a>) are disturbing beyond the immediate violence. In the context of contemporary race relations, this growing epidemic of anti-white mayhem was not supposed to happen. Blacks attacking whites <em>because they are white</em> represents an abrogation of a decades-long treaty between whites and blacks. Not a treaty in the formal sense, but an &#8220;understanding&#8221; that might as well be a legal contract. Let me explain.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw widespread black violence, much of it explicitly anti-white. This ranged from week-long urban riots to individual blacks killing or raping whites opportunistically. Many victims were chosen only because of race. The government&rsquo;s response was both enhanced policing and, of the utmost relevance, today&rsquo;s racial spoils system: affirmative action, set asides, massive anti-poverty spending, Justice Department decrees to help blacks get elected, dumbed down civil service standards, easy home mortgages  and sundry other &#8220;help blacks&#8221; programs. You can also add race-driven political correctness: banning &#8220;offensive&#8221; words (e.g., colored), exaggerating the role of blacks in American history, glowing media portrayals, downplaying black-on-white violent crime, and everything else designed to massage black egos. And for good measure, add hate crime laws, speech codes, and draconian punishment for those who spoke the truth on race. This is the price white America now pays for public safety.</p>
<p>The Treaty&rsquo;s aim was to stop the underclass from running wild by creating a black middle class who would, it was assumed, keep a lid on things out of economic self-interest. A newly appointed affirmative-action $125,000-a-year black school principal might not boost test scores but he would not encourage pupils to seek economic justice &#8220;by any means necessary.&#8221;  Better to have potential rabble-rousers toiling as corporate vice-presidents for diversity than stirring up the brothers.</p>
<p>Endless failed policies have not undermined the Treaty. In education, for example, Head Start and school meals funding is still growing despite disappointing outcomes. Armies of support staff now fill largely black schools even though academic performance remains unchanged. Clearly, this lavishness can be understood only as a pay-off to sustain racial peace. </p>
<p>The Treaty is sacrosanct across the ideological spectrum, and even admitting its existence is verboten. Nobody dare ask, for example, if all the affirmative action hires or government set-a-sides that guarantee domestic tranquility actually yield economic benefits. No struggling black university student worries that flunking out will endanger affirmative action; a dreadful drop-out rate will only bring more government largess.  </p>
<p>Since the 1960s, with scant exceptions, this pay-off has been amazingly successful. Once common &#8220;race war&#8221; rhetoric (burn baby burn, the fire next time etc.) has virtually vanished. Urban riots have gone from once a week to once a decade. Black militancy has largely reverted to its pre-1960s form of litigation and legislative demands. White mayors no longer walk the streets to keep the peace during the &#8220;long hot summer&#8221; or plead for Washington money so they can hire community-activist firebrands. Yes, black crime persists, black-run cities like Newark and Detroit sink into Third-World depravity, and whites are sometimes the victims of black crime, but 1960s style anti-white mayhem (and revolutionary oratory) has, at least until very recently, almost vanished. </p>
<p>The key question is whether these flash mobs are the first inklings of a soon-to-be broken Treaty (recall how the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; began with a single, seemingly innocuous incident). It is not inconceivable that America could return to 1960s-style racial upheaval. It is this possibility, not the criminality per se, that makes proliferating flash mobs especially frightening. Aggressive policing in response could prompt a vintage urban riot, and rioting is often contagious. Fiscal cutbacks might end millions of government &#8220;make work&#8221; jobs for blacks, and many of the slots blacks used to fill are now taken by Hispanic immigrants. Our former $125,000-a-year principal will no longer have an incentive to keep the peace.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that no black under the age of 40 remembers the pre-Treaty days, a world without the lucrative spoils system and ego-enhancing PC. For them, all the keep-the-peace benefits bestowed by a white-dominated government are normal, a justly deserved arrangement with no expiration date.</p>
<p>Can anything be done if matters begin reverting to pre-Treaty days? Probably not much beyond more aggressive policing, a risky tactic that might exacerbate violence. The Treaty cannot be amended to provide even more benefits for blacks. Pressuring American firms to hire more unqualified African Americans or upping the penalties for alleged racial discrimination will just push businesses to North Dakota or Asia. It is hard to imagine America becoming even more PC on race. Admitting more unqualified blacks to colleges would just boost the drop-out rate. And forget about more generous welfare at a time when cities and states already have budget shortfalls. If anything, the tide seems to be turning to renegotiate the Treaty to cut benefits for blacks. State bans on racial preferences  &mdash;  never legislated by elected representatives but forced on them by voters  &mdash;  are a good example of how ordinary people are thinking. </p>
<p>In short, the Treaty may be expiring but the spoils system  &mdash;  even if the benefits are a little leaner  &mdash;  is probably forever.</p>

		<p>I was just thinking that something fundamental has changed. </p>
<p>On Thursday evening we had a black president doing the &#8216;electric slide&rsquo; with his hip-hop friends at a private White House event&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;while white fairgoers were beaten by a black mob in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, didn&rsquo;t we elect a black president to help keep the peace? </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the unspoken agreement: we vote for Obama and his liberal policies and he helps unite the country and help African-American stay cool?</p>
<p>Instead he parties, privately, with his friends while ordinary whites are beaten in the streets by black mobs. </p>
<p>Some very deep, unspoken agreements in this society have indeed been broken. </p>

		<p>American blacks have now seen a brother become &#8220;the most powerful man in the world&#8221;, yet there are no reparations in sight, and whitey still holds most of the political and economic power.  What hope is left?  The cops and courts are still filling up the jails and prisons with black men, Hispanics are taking formerly black jobs, the cities are collapsing into ruin, and colleges are refusing to admit many low-performing blacks and even expelling sports recruits who are bad actors.  Black males are mad because some white women are refusing their advances, and black females are mad because black men want white women and white men generally don&rsquo;t want black women.  The dream has turned sour.</p>

<p>Well, never heard of such a treaty and I bet that almost none of the blacks have heard of it either. Preposterous and absurd even to consider such notion. Ever since I was a kid in the 1950&rsquo;s my perception is that the blacks have been after white blood and have never ever ceased in their desire to attack whites whenever possible. Not ameliorated in any sense at all by a &#8220;treaty&#8221;, whatever that was!</p>

		<p>Finally, somebody is saying it.  Let&rsquo;s do all we can to push this into the mainstream.  Jared Taylor should get American Thinker to publish it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve heard that every time a black robs, rapes, and murders another White, we are collectively acquitted for all the slavery, segregation, and racism of the past.</p>
<p>Black violence against Whites proves that &#8220;historical injustices&#8221; weren&rsquo;t injustice- they were self-preservation.  Social justice is not justice- it is surrender.</p>
<p>The best we can hope for at the moment is for a politician to start talking about black violence and rhetorically connect it to all that Whites have done for blacks, and start Whites to wondering if they&rsquo;ve been had by a big scam.  </p>
<p>Liberation from the horrors of Africa, liberation from work through Emancipation, integration,  civil rights, affirmative action, diversity preferences, unearned privileges, and all of it given to them for Free!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope the flash mob violence continues.  </p>
<p>Whites need to start asking &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the gratitude?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without black stopping the violence (won&rsquo;t happen), we have no moral compulsion to do anything more for them, other than them all the contempt they&rsquo;ve earned.</p>
<p>We need to hold the Civil Rights community accountable.  Every time the mobs flash, White reporters must show up at the NAACP office and Holder&rsquo;s DOJ, and start asking hard questions:</p>
<p>Where these &#8220;youth&#8221; benefited in any way from the Civil Rights Act?  Why didn&rsquo;t they improve?  </p>
<p>Black violence discredits all black demands.  We must learn how to spread the discrediting.  This article is a good first step.<br>

		<p>Good article. I would wonder if these flash mobs, which are now all over the internet, won&rsquo;t simply serve to harden the hearts of Whites? Back in the 1960s through most of the 1990s there was no internet so such attacks were usually a local phenomenon. Now we find out about them within a few hours after they occur. The blacks themselves will proudly post videos on youtube that get thousands of hits. It is not the same world that was once filtered through the big three-ABC, CBS, NBC. The alternative media might be a game-changer in our favor.</p>

		<p>This is an awesome essay.  Thank you, Mr. Kay.  This needs to be read widely.</p>
<p>I personally view the Unspoken Treaty as yet another &#8220;deferral of issues&#8221; with a lifespan lasting from 1960s American to our imminent crisis climax in the 2010s.  Like other social issues, it was kept at bay for over 40 years, but no longer.  Something finally has to give, thus I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with your concluding comments.<br>

		<p>The problem with Mr. Kay&rsquo;s theory is that some whites recognized their end of this informal treaty, but most blacks didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><i>A newly appointed affirmative-action $125,000-a-year black school principal might not boost test scores but he would not encourage pupils to seek economic justice &ldquo;by any means necessary.&rdquo; Better to have potential rabble-rousers toiling as corporate vice-presidents for diversity than stirring up the brothers.</i></p>
<p>The hard reality is that the $125,000 a year black principals usually are encouraging or excusing the anti-white violence of black students, and the corporate VPs for diversity are stirring up the brothers.  Even if the principal and the VP don&rsquo;t literally engage in agitation or propaganda, a black in &#8220;power&#8221; only emboldens other blacks to be hateful and violent.   Even disregarding Sarah Palin, whom I wanted to have a political future (and she mostly spoiled it), I would have voted &#8220;for&#8221; John McCain (drinking heavily both before and after voting) just to keep Obama from becoming President, for that very reason.  It will be why will vote &#8220;for&#8221; whatever white person the Republicans nominate, to get Obama out.</p>
<p><i>Nobody dare ask, for example, if all the affirmative action hires or government set-a-sides that guarantee domestic tranquility actually yield economic benefits.</i></p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t guarantee peace either.  The main reason is that black women are largely the beneficiaries of AA, while black men riot and wild and mob and commit run-of-the-mill street crimes.</p>
<p><i>Once common &ldquo;race war&rdquo; rhetoric (burn baby burn, the fire next time etc.) has virtually vanished. Urban riots have gone from once a week to once a decade. Black militancy has largely reverted to its pre-1960s form of litigation and legislative demands.</i></p>
<p>That vanishing act is largely an illusion.  The media that a long time ago peddled it largely changed tactics and covered it up because it was generating too much credible and effective white reaction.</p>
<p><i>White mayors no longer walk the streets to keep the peace during the &ldquo;long hot summer&rdquo; or plead for Washington money so they can hire community-activist firebrands.</i></p>
<p>Some still are, and to the extent they are not, it is because those cities now have black mayors that want Washington to give them money to hire community activist firebrands.</p>
<p><i>It is not inconceivable that America could return to 1960s-style racial upheaval.</i></p>
<p>Remember, Mr. Kay, for every action, there can be a powerful and not so equal reaction.  Like I said above, the untold story of 1960s politics was white racial reaction to black revelry.  I noted in this post at Jew Among You&rsquo;s blog (http://goo.gl/d5eFY) that the only biannual election cycle in the 1960s that could be interpreted as a liberal sweep was 1964, ONLY because of lingering JFK sympathy.</p>

		<p>I doubt the liberals believe any of their absurd propaganda. I mean, how else do they explain that the Vietnamese boat refuges came here with literally just the clothes on their back and not speaking a word of English and now they are highly successful professionals who do better on academic tests than whites and also are less taxpayer dependent than whites.</p>
<p>I predict within the next ten years one of the following will happen: 1) Whites will wake up en masses and fight back in this race war which means that me, being a dark skinned Indian immigrant, will either have to live in an all-Indian enclave in the U.S. or return to India, to protect myself and my family from Black violence and chaos since whites will no longer let me live around them.  2) America will continue to deteriorate into a third world chaos and become like Brazil where the elite live in enclaves surrounded by electric fence and the masses rule the street with thuggery and violence much like Brazil. We will have mostly white enclaves as well as a few Indian and Chinese enclaves. </p>
<p>Either way, liberalism is gonna die and I am facing the reality that my 25+ years in the first world nation of the U.S. may be over and I may have to prepare my U.S. raised kids for a return to India (much to their chagrin). But what can I do? I&rsquo;m not white but I feel that more of us Indians &#8220;get it&#8221; compared to the brainwashed white liberals out there.</p>

		<p>Excuse me if I post Before I read the article but what&rsquo;s the &#8216;treaty&rsquo; here being broken? That it&rsquo;s Ok to say, or do anything to any number of whites including maiming injuries, as long as it does not result in death or murder? Or course even if you do murder, the treaty requires that even the murderer be considered the true-victim even though remaining behind bars for a time? After the murders, that&rsquo;s when you break out the &#8216;black on black crime&rsquo; seminars. </p>

<p>As fine as this article was, are you sure the author is an academic, as in university professor? The revolution is now part of the mainstream curriculum. It&rsquo;s taught more now than ever, tho it is preached and promoted in mostly non-violent terms. Why shouldn&rsquo;t it be? The radicals are now in charge. The entire leftists agenda (often further left than the radicals back then) is accepted as a given. It&rsquo;s almost unthinkable to oppose it. It would certainly be &#8216;insensitive&rsquo;. The revolution doesn&rsquo;t need to be spelled out. It&rsquo;s succeeded.    </p>

		<p>Anyone with much experience with blacks knows that they will always take your kindness as weakness, and on an instinctual level, they are absolutely correct. The electing of Obama was the ultimate weakness on white America&rsquo;s part, and the blacks know it. Peace offerings are always offered by the weaker side. In South Africa, the freeing of Mandela, the legalizing of the ANC and the electing of Mandela as president were not appreciated by that country&rsquo;s blacks as anything but complete surrender. They think we threw in the towel just to avoid the knockout. Not a strong bargaining position for us, and the blacks know it.</p>
<p>A slight correction on this article: Since the &#8216;60&rsquo;s, blacks have in fact been allowed to target whites for racial violence, but only if done in a way to more easily allow white liberals (and police) to describe it as robbing or mugging, i.e. economic crimes that were in no way racially motivated. This current wave of jubilant, celebratory attacks on whites will make it difficult for the apologists to wave away as the justified cries for help of angry, deprived black children with no hope.</p>

<p>Yes, your lucidity is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>The bottom line is : diversity could have been a strength if a few, select percent of highly-skilled, hard-working immigrants had been allowed to become Americans ; instead we never solved the black problem and meanwhile opened the gates wide to the ceaseless flow of Mexicans (and now Africans and Arabs). </p>
<p>By doing so we lost all hope of actually profiting from the clever immigration policies we used to have (mostly prior to 1930) and must now renounce ALL immigration / non-white presence. </p>
<p>A terrible shame really. But probably an opportunity for countries like India who will very much need people like you.</p>

		<p>A message to my fellow Amren readers:</p>
<p>Having been in high school within the last decade, obtained several degrees, have one more semester of graduate school and taught middle and high school, subbing at several different districts with multiple social and economic classes, I will say that whites (youth) ARE waking up.</p>
<p>As for my generation, the echo boomers (20-30ish) they are a lost cause and the end result of hippie love-ins.  But the next generation, the grand children of the baby boomers and the children of the Yuppies and not as naive.</p>
<p>It is theorized, and I believe this to an extent, that there are really only two generations in the the U.S. and they keep flip flopping, the hippies and the yuppies.  My generation put Obama into office, the next will not I believe.</p>
<p>Too many kids from too many areas and classes were all too racially aware.  I would constantly get questions pertained to an NAAWP and young girls saying things like &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care if you think I am racist, I&rsquo;m not going out with you.&#8221;  To blacks and the like.</p>
<p>The generation born from &#8216;93ish - 2000&rsquo;s will be the best hope we will have for a racial awakening, or what I like to call reality.</p>
<p>And as for 9, Sureesh:</p>
<p>Yes, move.  That is not a threat or me being mean, it is good advice.  Within the next few years start looking for property in India because when it does happen you will have millions of Indians with Western money going back there in droves, real estate will sky rocket.  Same goes for everyone, really.</p>
<p>As for the Indian enclaves, Don&rsquo;t assume there will be any.  Hispanics will attack anyone that is not hispanic, blacks will attack you because you are dark skinned and helping out whitey so you are a traitor.  Your only hope is to have whites protect you.  And that is if they can and/or want to at that point.  So have a plan B.  I do and I&rsquo;m white and was born in the U.S.</p>

		<p>Sureesh, your comment reveals another very distressing aspect of the &#8220;black&#8221; problem.  The Hindus and Sikhs I&rsquo;ve met here are the soul of courtesy, good nature, industry, and competence who vindicate every argument one can make about the benefit of immigration.  Our resident Africans, by way of contrast, leave a path of pain, destruction, and squalor and they may create precisely the danger to yourself you describe if whites ever get fed up.  The self-delusion of whites is the saddest thing of all to see throughout the educated classes.</p>
<p>I still adamantly insist that the U.S. is a white, Christian nation and the earlier 90% majority white share needs to be reestablished.  That still leaves a lot of room for quality immigrants.</p>

Ever since I was a kid in the 1950&rsquo;s my perception is that the blacks have been after white blood and have never ever ceased in their desire to attack whites whenever possible. Not ameliorated in any sense at all by a &ldquo;treaty&rdquo;, whatever that was!</i> </p>
<p>I think what the author meant is that while black mayhem has certainly been bad continuously throughout the past several decades, it has not been nearly as bad as it could be  &mdash;  or as bad as it once was. It has ben sort of a &#8220;low-grade simmering&#8221; rather than a &#8220;full-scale boiling over.&#8221;</p>
<p>As stated in the article, &#8220;Urban riots have gone from once a week [in the 1960s] to once a decade.&#8221; Black riots once a decade are still intolerable to any right-thinking society, but it&rsquo;s not as bad as it was in the 1960s.</p>
<p>What the author may also have meant (and should perhaps have explicitly stated) is that whites have performed the ultimate pandering to blacks in electing a &#8220;black&#8221; president, but this has still not appeased blacks, who are now misbehaving <i>more</i> with their &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; than they did before Obama was elected.</p>
<p>I think the author does make an interesting point that these &#8220;flash riots&#8221; could be a precursor to &#8220;1960s-style racial upheaval,&#8221; at which point a lot of whites could reawaken. We will have to wait and see.</p>

		<p>This article is a fine contribution to the understanding of modern America. There are a few random points that occurred to me.</p>
<p>1-Police in the urban areas that experienced black mob violence in the 1960&rsquo;s developed the tactics to deal with it. As one cop told me, &#8220;Control the rooftops, and you can control the ******s.&#8221; At that time the police had communications capabilities that the youths did not. Also, these riots were confined to black neighbourhoods; sorties into white areas were dangerous and unprofitable.</p>
<p>2-Blacks in 1960&rsquo;s to the early 1990s were the only beloved Minority. Now they have to compete with Hispanics, Asians, Indians (imported), Africans (imported), etc., etc. for goodies. Perhaps they&rsquo;re releasing their African aggression on the only group they can.</p>
<p>3-As I remember the situation, white men thought that each caving in to African demands would be the final one, e.g.  the Civil Rights act of 1965, Affirmative Action, the King holiday. If white men had been resolute and at some point taken the position that blacks had gotten all they would ever get, the situation would be different. But for 50 years, white men have not been resolute, each caving in followed by another caving in.</p>
<p>This point ties in with #2. I believe that the black-white conflicts could have been settled more or less peacefully by 1970, with the vast majority on both sides satisfied. America would have been in position to face the economic, environmental and geopolitical challenges of the post Vietnam war period. But this (for whatever reasons) did not happen. Now it&rsquo;s no longer a two group conflict, but a many group conflict. I wonder if any non-chaotic outcome is possible</p>

		<p>&#8220;I would wonder if these flash mobs, which are now all over the internet, won&rsquo;t simply serve to harden the hearts of Whites? Back in the 1960s through most of the 1990s there was no internet so such attacks were usually a local phenomenon. Now we find out about them within a few hours after they occur. The blacks themselves will proudly post videos on youtube that get thousands of hits. It is not the same world that was once filtered through the big three-ABC, CBS, NBC. The alternative media might be a game-changer in our favor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. It definitely is a different ball game now. I have an RSS feed that showers me all day 24/7 with every news item that the establishment media would never dare touch with a ten foot pole, lest the general public catch a whiff of what The Rock is really cookin&rsquo; (so to speak). Some days I need to take a Xanax just to keep my head from exploding. One can only tolerate so much harsh-reality in one sitting these days. I can only imagine how quickly other Whites are being de-programmed on the Internet.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is what to do about it. As we all just witnessed with the debt-ceiling &#8220;compromise&#8221;, there is no voting it away&hellip; Oh it was a &#8220;compromise&#8221; all right. The establishment felt some genuine political resistance from the waning White majority via these freshman Tea Party congressmen, like Rand Paul, and what did they do? They created a Star Chamber-like &#8220;Super Congress&#8221; to more adequately insulate themselves from White voters.</p>
<p>The media&rsquo;s against us.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s against us.</p>
<p>The non-white welfare recipients are definitely against us.</p>
<p>Even many Whites who haven&rsquo;t had a taste of the establishment&rsquo;s bitter-sweet Diversity Wine(tm) are unaccountably against us.</p>
<p>I know that sounds defeatist, grim, melodramatic, etc (I woke up to *YET ANOTHER* Milwaukee Fair &#8216;Beat Whitey to a Pulp&rsquo; story)&hellip; but that&rsquo;s what is most disconcerting about the situation. There seems to be no rational recourse&hellip; legally, politically, socially, can&rsquo;t vote it away, can&rsquo;t reason w/ it&hellip; hell, in some Scandinavian countries there are little White girls whom, after being systematically gang raped by swarthy emissaries of 3rd world diversity, get their court cases thrown out because the govt. can&rsquo;t allow the public to know the true cost of diversity.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t something where we can just throw our hands up and say, &#8220;Well, whadda ya gonna do?&#8221; and then flip on a &#8216;reality&rsquo; show. This IS reality&hellip; and we&rsquo;re all neck deep in it now whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>Not that anyone here is unaware of these things&hellip; I&rsquo;m just more frustrated than usually today.</p>
<p>Ugh&hellip; what a complete and utter mess we&rsquo;re in. No wonder White people never have kids anymore!</p>

		<p>Well, nothing lasts forever.  The truth cannot be covered up forever.</p>
<p>What does one suspect the current anti-government, uber-libertarian nature of the opposition is really about?  Government and public sectors have been so corrupted by substandard minority incompetents that even good ideas that save money like universal health care (we spend almost 15% of GDP on health care, live 78.2 years, no civilized country in the world spends more than 10% GDP while all live several months to a few years longer) are shelved for two eminently understandable reasons.</p>
<p>1.  They would be (mis)administered by incompetent minorities.</p>
<p>2.  They would disproportionately benefit those already obnoxiously sponging off the productive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets VERY interesting.  Whites are waking up.  The critical group of whites are those who wish to have a functional government but are increasingly making the connection between black incompetence and&hellip;</p>
<p>1.  Wasted resources that frustrate desire for functional governance, and&hellip;</p>
<p>2.  Legitimate white disgust at being forever threatened with violence and shaken down by incompetent violent blacks.</p>
<p>The new white nationalism will not be simply a rubber stamp anarchic corporatism.  That garbage results in white middle class exploitation by a purely profit driven system that sells them downriver as surely as does affirmative action appeasement socialism.  It also results in cultural degradation where any degenerate, trivial, pop-cultural lobotomizing fad enriches and glorifies the stupidest, most debased, lowest human common denominator.</p>
<p>No, American whites, along with many Asians and some Hispanics want a third option, a third way.  A new form of folk fascism with democratic urges, where globe gallivanting forever wars are increasingly replaced with government/private great projects (mega-engineering schemes, space exploration and colonization, etc - great projects a people can be proud of that create employment while building something lasting and useful), where a qualified merit based civil service replaces the set-aside incompetence of our current system&hellip;</p>
<p>This is what white (and, largely, non-black) Americans will come to increasingly want and demand.</p>
<p>And with every outrage perpetrated on our sons and daughters by these oversexed, low IQ, violence prone blacks, non-black America sees blacks as increasingly increasingly unworthy of sympathy&hellip;</p>
<p>Until finally the notion of some kind of a &#8220;race war&#8221; that results in a better society becomes preferable to the inevitable societal collapse of duck speak multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Out of this will indeed arise a more or less Caucasian &#8220;American race&#8221; that will include some Hispanic, Asian, and even &#8220;ten percenter&#8221; African blood.  Like it or not, the new American race will ultimately include some non-Caucasian input, but will be no less white than modern Italians, who at an average IQ of 103, are the smartest in Europe.  </p>
<p>Vestigial communities of others will likely remain in geographically distinct areas and as long as they follow the rules and keep problems to themselves, who will care?  </p>
<p>Ultimately the most important evolutionary struggle will not be between races so much as  between &#8220;homo superior&#8221; and &#8220;homo inferior&#8221;, although obviously those members of races more likely to possess traits amenable to survival and progress will be among those more likely to survive and thrive as homo superior rather than languish or perish as homo inferior.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africans and those descended from them will be hard pressed indeed.</p>

		<p>Sureesh, white Americans do not hate people of color.  Indians are respected for their culture and civility.  I assume that you are Indian and I apologize if I am incorrect.  We hate incivility and disorder, something that blacks are known for.  Whites will appreciate and even like respectable and honest black people.  But unfortunately, the majority of them lack these traits.  Most blacks feel that we are responsible for their plight and demand reparations from us for slavery.  Instead of feeling greatful that their lineage escape the horrible plight of Africa, they maintain grievance over what happened hundreds of years ago and remain unaware of the great gains that they have made in terms of equality in American life.  It is better in their minds to remain ignorant and blame whitey for their problems.  Their is no accountability to their way of thinking.  It has been this way for decades.  Muslims are viewed with suspicion since no Islamic religious figure has condemned the September 11 attacks and most Muslims are quiet about what happened then.  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about living here.  Be an American asset, not a liability.</p>

		<p>Another factor is that we can no longer afford affirmative action or other hand outs. It is time for blacks to stand on their own two feet. Since they have not prepared for this, thinking that the hand outs will never end, the backlash will be severe. Mexicans and orientals hate the blacks and will not hold back their hatred. </p>

		<p>The black ghetto rioters were emboldened by the civil rights legislation, the War on Poverty, and the decline in incarceration that happened during the 1960s.<br>
 <br>
The riots were ended by the election of Richard Nixon, and a return to a harsher approach to crime in general and black crime in particular.<br>
 <br>
From 1980 to 2000 the prison population nearly tripled. From 1980 to 2009 the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants declined from 5,950.0 to 3,465.5. <br>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not white but I feel that more of us Indians &#8220;get it&#8221; compared to the brainwashed white liberals out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is SO true. Most Indian guys I&rsquo;ve talked to are WAY more aware and practical about the politics and race situation in this country than native-born Whites. They don&rsquo;t seem to have that (typically White) knee-jerk rationalization and self-delusion about racial issues.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m speculating wildly, but that&rsquo;s probably a genetically-born character trait in Whites&hellip; the &#8216;just get along&rsquo; gene (so to speak) that developed early on in northern Europe. Now that trait is being exploited by racially adversarial political predators (to spectacular effect).</p>
<p>What is so frustrating about this liberal politically correct establishment is that they themselves have made it nearly intolerable for ANYONE, no matter what their race or national original, to live a healthy productive life in this country. In their insane pursuit of *absolute equality* they can not and will not &#8220;discriminate&#8221; between an immigrant who would be a great benefit to this country or one who will most likely become a life-long welfare recipient w/ virtually no skill set to offer. They are somehow both &#8220;equal&#8221; in their eyes.</p>
<p>It seems that the establishment wants fewer Indian doctors and engineers and more AK-47 welding Somali welfare thugs and gang-rapists. That&rsquo;s just terrible for everybody involved&hellip; Well, everybody with an IQ and a work ethic at least.</p>
<p>No matter what their goal might have been initially, it seems as though multiculturalism will inevitably result in multi-mono-culturalism and self-segregation (as you predict).   &mdash;   Leave it to ham-fisted liberal White morons to ruin it for everyone (while accusing everyone else of &#8216;racism&rsquo;, etc). God, I can&rsquo;t stand those people&hellip; I really, really can&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re on my last nerve at this point. The sheer insanity and narcissism of the modern &#8220;progressive&#8221; just defies all rational explanation&hellip;</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re at a turning point in history.  The current budget problems (which will only get worse, since the first baby boomers turn 65 this year) will force cutbacks that differentially affect minorities.  The silver lining is that some percentage of Mexicans will go back home as low-skill employment disappears.</p>
<p>These flash mobs are the first generation of black youths who&rsquo;ve been raised their whole lives under an educational system that teaches that oppression is the DOMINANT theme of American history.  They truly believe they&rsquo;ve been driven to violence by a white racist society, and have as much right to do so as the blacks who sat at segregated lunch counters in the 50s.  This will turn around when city tourism departments start losing all white business, and will really hit the fan when a white celebrity relative is killed by a mob. </p>

		<p>This is a good article, but I would add one covenant to the Treaty:<br>
Incarceration.</p>
<p>The benefits of this silent treaty has been not only that you co-opt the firebrands for oft-meaningless symbolism, but also that a larger and larger share of violent, often young, black men are sent into the prisons for ridiculous charges. This is to keep them off the street where they will often attack whites in due time simply because they are filled with such hate.</p>
<p>The U.S. has the most inmates of all democracies by a wide margin per capita. This isn&rsquo;t a coincidence. </p>
<p>As the Age of Austerity settles further and further, I think that the final hour of this nation will be decided. Either some sort of fundamental shift, which I still find unlikely but nonetheless the likelier by the day, or a double-down on the diversity. This double-down would be short lived and afterwards we would wound up with a Brazil-like situation. Everyone&rsquo;s on their own and the brown, increasingly desperate and violent, underclass which has by that time (or perhaps already) become too large to contain has to be appeased. </p>
<p>Exodus will ultimately ensue. To Europe, Canada, Australia and perhaps even parts of Latin America, Asia and/or very minor parts of Africa like Botswana.</p>

		<p>The age of the internet and the proliferation of the African violence videos are the best thing to happened to race relations in this country for a while.  Regardless of all of the PC rhetoric and romantic idealism, people believe and know a truth they can see with their own eyes.  It will likely be the emerging generations of white American citizens who will be the most enlightened about the true nature of African Americans.  And hopefully knowing the truth and with the passage of the ultra-deluded-hippie-liberal generations from power they can turn the tide away from propagating the myth and employ more constructive social actions.  That is of course predicated on their ability to see past the African indoctrination nonsense that is so prevalent in today&rsquo;s educational systems.   </p>

It isn&rsquo;t dark skin that&rsquo;s the problem.  It&rsquo;s the behavior of people of sub-Saharan heritage, whether their skin is light or dark.  Most Americans, IMO, can readily ascertain that Indians are not what are called &#8220;blacks&#8221; in America.  <br>
The problem that some Americans have with Indians has to do with immigration, and this attitude has been worsened greatly by the illegal immigration of south-of-the-borderites.  Also, some people believe that all Indians are Moslems.  <br>
I don&rsquo;t know, of course, if you really believe that things might become as bad for Indians as you sometimes indicate.  But I personally don&rsquo;t believe anti-black sentiments have anything to do with anyone with blacks.  </p>

<p>Sureesh, I don&rsquo;t believe these claims, show me the evidence, where are the statistics. And don&rsquo;t confuse Chinese with Vietnamese.</p>
<p>Also whites need to get one thing straight in their heads. We are not just talking about being out numbered by nonwhites, we are talking about, in a democratic system, being RULED by nonwhites. And since nonwhites expend so much effort trying to be around whites, they will probably make &#8220;white enclaves&#8221; illegal.</p>

		<p>Whites have been judging blacks by the content of their character years before MLK ever conceived of using that punch line in a speech  &mdash;  what else could adequately explain White flight on such a scale as exist in the US? Whites need to physically remove themselves from and boycott those businesses and venues that cater to large numbers of blacks. Boycotting businesses perceived as catering to the black demographic, such as McDonalds, and avoiding &#8220;community events&#8221; held in cities with large black populations is not only in the interest of the safety of your family and yourself, it is the most powerful and potent weapon yet available to Whites.  </p>

		<p>The financial part of this &#8220;treaty&#8221; was a Ponzi scheme from the get-go.  White taxpayers were expected for 50 years to subsidize black fecundity by paying for programs that increased black birthrates and also more deeply entrenched every sort of social malaise among them.  Today, we are in the position of having to borrow endlessly increasing amounts of money from China in order to operate a system that was never workable and is now quite unsustainable.</p>
<p>The inherent fault with the &#8220;treaty&#8221; is that the Johnson administration assumed - with the &#8220;Great Society&#8221; alphabet soup collection of welfare programs - that paying people who&rsquo;s average IQ is approximately 80 to behave would eventually (magic?) turn them into civilized European whites.</p>

<p>Either way, liberalism is gonna die and I am facing the reality that my 25+ years in the first world nation of the U.S. may be over and I may have to prepare my U.S. raised kids for a return to India (much to their chagrin). But what can I do? I&rsquo;m not white but I feel that more of us Indians &ldquo;get it&rdquo; compared to the brainwashed white liberals out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sureesh is an individual who I&rsquo;d dearly like to sit down and share 3 or 4 beers with on a leisurely afternoon - where we both had a real heart-to-heart, open discussion about race and about this subject of whether White European people are entitled and justified to be concerned about the efforts on the part of our hostile ruling elites to subject us to race replacement, racial dispossession and eventually racial genocide inside our own native homelands.   And, make no mistake - that IS exactly what is at stake here.    </p>
<p>Sureesh has been in the USA for over 25 years.   From his comments, I get the faint idea that he understands what the Cultural Marxists on both the left and the right have been trying to engineer and has the view that it is morally wrong and will certainly lead to the destruction and deconstruction of America.    He&rsquo;s concerned for his future and for the future of his kids, which is understandable.   But, how many other non-European immigrants share his view?   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say not many.   I read articles written all the time by non-white journalists - Fareed Zakaria, Reuben Navarette - are two that come immediately to mind.  These non-white journalists never, not ever - concede that the United States of America was founded, settled and tamed by 100 percent White European men and women.  They never concede that the &#8216;posterity&rsquo; of our Founding Fathers were and still are, the direct White European genetic descendants of those 100 percent White European Founders - and are NOT a conglomeration of various non-European aliens from every third world failure of a nation on Earth. </p>
<p>Instead, these journalists write their columns where they literally salivate over their dreams of seizing control of America, of stealing the birthright of those European descendants who were bequeathed this nation by their 100 percent White European Founders.    To these non-white journalists - its as though they are living inside a dream fantasy world and the 1860 Homestead Act has been redeclared and the entire North American continent has been put up for grabs and isn&rsquo;t owned or claimed by anyone - and most particularly not by the White European descendants of our 100 percent White European Founding Fathers.   Perhaps this is because Whites haven&rsquo;t been acting and behaving like they are owners?    Our people, our race, and  our progeny are the rightful &#8216;owners&rsquo; of these lands in North America - because these lands are our BIRTHRIGHT.    Non-European people who have been allowed to come here and prosper need to understand and accept the fact that they are here only due to our generosity.  They are invited guests and such guests should be expected to not become arrogant and start getting the idea that they are going to take this nation away from it&rsquo;s rightful owners.    They should show the proper respect towards their hosts.  But, this is not the way the vast majority of non-Europeans in the USA act or think or behave today, in 2011.  <br>
They are kicking the homeowner out of the master bedroom and telling him to move into the guest bedroom, and not to get too comfortable in there, because it won&rsquo;t be too much longer before the homeowner is going to be kicked out of the house ompletely.  </p>

<p>&#8220;I still adamantly insist that the U.S. is a white, Christian nation and the earlier 90% majority white share needs to be reestablished. That still leaves a lot of room for quality immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish this could be done.   I would support it 100 percent.  However, it would require whites to rediscover their racial pride, solidarity, and backbone and to cure themselves of this limp-wristed, nauseating, disgusting tendency to be silenced and intimidated by minority race hustlers and the one tiny minority group who pulls their strings.  There is far, far too many whites today who are brainwashed and infected with media induced white guilt and white self-loathing and whites who fit this description do not have the guts to stand up and reassert <br>
themselves and reclaim their rightful position as a 90 percent majority.</p>
<p>Therefore, Sureesh&rsquo;s predictions are likely going to come true - America has been effectively destroyed and ethno-states will be the future.   Here is a quote from a poster on another website that I saw earlier today and it fits this situation perfectly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are facing is pure racial hatred and jealousy–because they covet our territory, because they see us as rivals for resources and jobs, because they want our pretty toys. &#8221;   </p>
<p>And, also our pretty women, might I add.   That turns it into a war where our entire genetic future is in jeopardy and the stakes can&rsquo;t get any higher than that.  </p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m speculating wildly, but that&rsquo;s probably a genetically-born character trait in Whites&hellip; the &lsquo;just get along&rsquo; gene (so to speak) that developed early on in northern Europe. Now that trait is being exploited by racially adversarial political predators (to spectacular effect).&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, you are speculating wildly.  Whites have genetics that led them to invent the modern world, while their other genetics allowed them to conquer the world, while warring with one another.  There is nothing in European history that provides for an extraordinary tendency to &#8220;get along&#8221; other than a funny combination of Marxism and Christianity, in their most recent Western manifestations.  &#8220;Get along gene, indeed.</p>

<p>Sureesh, white Americans do not hate people of color. Indians are respected for their culture and civility. I assume that you are Indian and I apologize if I am incorrect. We hate incivility and disorder, something that blacks are known for. Whites will appreciate and even like respectable and honest black people. But unfortunately, the majority of them lack these traits. Most blacks feel that we are responsible for their plight and demand reparations from us for slavery. Instead of feeling greatful that their lineage escape the horrible plight of Africa, they maintain grievance over what happened hundreds of years ago and remain unaware of the great gains that they have made in terms of equality in American life. It is better in their minds to remain ignorant and blame whitey for their problems. Their is no accountability to their way of thinking. It has been this way for decades. Muslims are viewed with suspicion since no Islamic religious figure has condemned the September 11 attacks and most Muslims are quiet about what happened then.</p>

<p>There are over 3,000,000 East Indians in the US, they are fiercely nationalistic and have no qualms about stealing white collar jobs from whites, and have the same propensity to impose their cultural values on people of European descent, whom they view as inferior to themselves (see link). <a href="http://goo.gl/jnD4i" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/jnD4i</a></p>

<p>I am writing to join the others here in saying that what most whites are against is the behavior. No one would mind living next to Bill Cosby or Johnny Mathis! But we live in a time when the &#8220;president&#8221; pals around with gangsta rappers (Jay-Z at the White House again last night; Common), and we hate that the uncivilized, brutish ways of the ghetto have now been accepted as not only mainstream, but something to strive for! (Talk about Defining Deviancy Down! The glorification of pimps, of all people?)</p>
<p>We have a special relationship with Indians because they knew and suffered through the moslim invaasions and insurrections long before 9-11. Also, India is a democracy with high-tech universities and centers we relate to. They are our natural allies (in addition to that, their borders are &#8220;bloody&#8221; from touching those of the &#8220;stans&#8221; and other moslem countries; geographically, they are important to us, a barrer to Russia and China.)</p>
<p>Most of us are not against skin color. We are against the behavior that too often goes with it. When 93% of blacks are so tribal that they vote for obama based only on his (fraudulent) &#8220;blackness&#8221; (He is mostely arab/white), and more and more are joining BLT churches and the nation of islam, when black brawling in the streets become common&hellip;Well, that&rsquo;s what we are fighting, not you.</p>
<p>We need to be like the English Defence League, that welcomes members of all ethnicities IF they are willing to assimilate, adopt the culture, work, and not ask for hand-outs (all of which includes dropping the &#8220;black only&#8221; dialect, the black-only clothing labels, different languages and holidays, the &#8220;hip-hop culture,&#8221; etc.) But nobody living in the 7th century and no indigenous people who think they are &#8220;owed&#8221; anything by those who built this world are welcome.  </p>

		<p>Sureesh:  I think you are right that America might well end up with so much ethnic conflict that you and all the other Indians might have to leave.  If only a small number of non-whites had been allowed to immigrate post-1965, then the present situation might be manageable, and you and your children might have been able to stay here for a lifetime.</p>
<p>But, just as &#8220;compassion fatigue&#8221; sets in among white people who have given generously for African famine relief two or three times, only to find that a new famine has broken out in Africa, white people are now experiencing &#8220;immigrant fatigue.&#8221;  We are sick of newcomers, sick of people with foreign accents, sick of exotic religions demanding accommodation, and sick of people DEMANDING to come over here and then DEMANDING affirmative action and special financial handouts reserved for nonwhites (but paid for by whites.)  All of the older white people in my family wistfully remember the all-white communities of their childhood, and are incredibly angry that it is now impossible to escape from diversity.  Even in rural areas it is no longer possible to get away from foreigners.  </p>
<p>I agree with the above poster who advised you to acquire assets in India so that you and your children will have something when you have to return there.  Most white people don&rsquo;t see you as an asset.  They see you and your children as parasites who take job and educational opportunities away from them and from their own children.  When the violence gets bad enough to put you and your children at risk, white people will worrying about taking care of themselves during the period of chaos.  The conservatives will feel that you never belonged here in the first place.  The liberals may wring their hands over the death of diversity and the multi-culti dream, but they, too, will be focused on their own safety and not on yours.</p>

<p>#29 Brazil-like situation: everyone&rsquo;s on their own and the brown, increasingly desperate and violent, underclass has to be appeased!</p>
<p>I live very well in a Brazilian big city and in my condo, as our neighbors, there isn&rsquo;t any &ldquo;electric fence&rdquo; despite the fact that a sizeable favela is not far way. We do take some protection against violence and violence in Brazil has a race aspect for sure, but it is mainly profit motivated. Thuggery is a problem but it does not &#8220;rule the streets&#8221;.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;an increasingly desperate and violent brown underclass that has to be appeased&rdquo; forget about it! To the very contrary: our large brown people make a very effective buffer against black on white violence. They testify that &#8220;whitening&#8221; is a possible way up on the social scale for Brazilian blacks. This is the Brazilian way, you do not like it, but in some aspects it works better than yours. </p>
<p>Finally, I agree with #43. I do not know any Brazilian who would really like to live in India.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t want foreigners, Indian or otherwise, taking our jobs, whether those be doctors and engineers or low-pay blue-collar ones. America does not &#8220;need&#8221; imported PhDs when we have so many homegrown ones out of work.</p>
<p>That said, there&rsquo;s a way to express these opinions without sounding like you&rsquo;re going to snap. Without sounding like you&rsquo;re HOPING for racial violence to erupt on a massive scale so that some non-white guy you&rsquo;re disgruntled with because of something he said on the Internet will be caught between violent blacks and unsympathetic whites. As upset as I am about outsourcing and H1B, I recognize that the dark-skinned people who are unfairly benefiting from these policies did not engineer said policies, nor did they (with a few exceptions) slip in here like thieves in the night. They were invited in by traitorous white elites within the government, and it is those traitors who should be the targets of our disgust.</p>
<p>There are millions of white Americans who have had it with black mob violence and Obama&rsquo;s extremism. Millions of white men and women who could potentially join our cause. And why don&rsquo;t they? Because a small number of loudmouths with a severe lack of self-control keep turning them off. There are some things that will never appeal to anyone other than a tiny fringe, and will keep scaring fence-sitters away. These include but are not limited to: Glorifying violence, ranting about ZOG/JOG, calling for fascism instead of limited government, Northwest Fronting, one-percenting (the ultimate in self-defeating ideologies), wanting to ally with radical Muslims, obsession with ceremony and regalia, lionizing has-been WN politicians, and whining that &#8220;everyone else&#8221; is a &#8220;stupid sheep&#8221; that needs to be told what to do &#8220;for their own good&#8221; by Internet Tough Guys. We&rsquo;d all do well to remember that a proud, unapologetic, and free White nation was what we had a mere 60 years ago, it was accepted by the vast majority of the population (including some non-whites), and it was all done without jackboots or funny hats. Until we (race realists) can provide a *pragmatic* (read: non-kooky) alternative to the status quo, voters will keep running back to the neocons.</p>

		<p>So we&rsquo;ve basically had to bribe an appallingly large segment of the black population with material goodies in an effort to keep them from acting on their natural genetic instincts. </p>
<p>When one looks at black crime stats since the &rsquo;60s that&rsquo;s only worked to a certain degree. They still commit an alarmingly high rate of savage crime.</p>
<p>We always hear how if you take someone out of a bad environment and place them in a better environment they&rsquo;ll behave better. We&rsquo;re told the reasons for rampant black criminal behavior are because of poverty, &#8216;racism&rsquo;, lack of opportunity, lack of a father in the home, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>David Duke once remarked that blacks are like children. Well, children can only be appeased for so long before they start throwing their tantrums again. But black tantrums don&rsquo;t result in thrown and broken toys and lots of yelling, screaming, kicking and crying. Black tantrums result in destroyed innocent lives and play a disproportionate role in the destruction of the society in which they&rsquo;re allowed to roam freely and unchecked. I believe the overwhelming majority of blacks can&rsquo;t handle freedom. For them, &#8216;freedom&rsquo; means the right to rob, rape, assault, murder and act with crude, reckless abandon.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Savagery is locked into the unchangeable black genetic code. And no one or no environment can change that fact.</p>
<p>Racial separation is the only real solution to the race problem. Nothing else will ever truly work.</p>

It&rsquo;s this very tendency towards egalitarianism that has resulted in the mess we&rsquo;re in today.  Those that want to &#8220;embrace&#8221; the Sureesh&rsquo;s of the world have been brainwashed into having and are still carrying that old nemesis &#8220;white guilt&#8221;.  Sureesh, do us all a favor and take not only your family but all your countrymen as well and go somewhere other that here.  I&rsquo;ve had many dealings with you and your kin over the years and have found you all arrogant, condescending jerks.  Do not delude yourself that simply because you have an IQ higher than room temperature and naturally straight hair that we&rsquo;re some sort of &#8220;home boys&#8221; because we&rsquo;re most assuredly not.  Here&rsquo;s a code more readers here should adopt and implement if they haven&rsquo;t already. When dealing with &#8220;people of color&#8221; and  all religions other than Christianity; avoid them when you can, tolerate them only when you have to and never, ever trust them.  An earlier poster said that &#8220;whites&#8221; don&rsquo;t hate.  Excuse me.  An attitude like this is again what gets us (whites) in trouble.  Love your folk, save some hate for everyone else.  It&rsquo;s only natural.  </p>

		<p>Yes, something has changed. In the 60&rsquo;s there were also white flash mobs. They were called student &#8220;protests.&#8221; The flash mobs were made up of white liberal spoiled little brats. The flash mob of the 60&rsquo;s are busy running the country today. They don&rsquo;t have time to go out an play like they use to. Instead they send their children out to play, the Black flash mobs. And like doting parents, the white flash mobs of the 60&rsquo;s look after and encourage the Black flash mobs of today.</p>

		<p> The Federal Government will completely destroy any white uprising of any kind.<br>
 They will put it down hard, fast,deadly and final. All rights will be suspended until the threat is neutralized.They will not stop until they have eliminated a very large percentage of the white race. The Federal Government has enacted laws to thin out the white race since the 1960&rsquo;s and will not stop once we fully understand just what they are doing. The big difference will be how they go about it. Think ; Jew&rsquo;s, Nazi-Germany 1933-1945.</p>

		<p>Mr. Kay seem like a defeatist in that he opines that there is no solution to the violent black flash mobs that are sweeping the nation.  So I guess we&rsquo;re supposed to sit back and let our fellow whites get maimed or killed until feral blacks grow tired of it all and decide to move on to something else?</p>
<p>This will not stop until whites begin organizing and physically confronting blacks mobs.  The police brass obviously have no intention of preventing more attacks other than to beg black race hustlers to control their own people. At a steep price, of course. Police officers who do wish to do something know that if they enforce the law that they will be at the center of a nationwide media firestorm over so called police brutality, which will destroy their lives and their livelihood. </p>
<p>The burden falls on each and every one of us.  However, given the chronic shortage of testosterone and bravery among white men I don&rsquo;t expect much.  So, I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to endure stories of more whites getting their brains beaten in and publish more books about white identity.     </p>

		<p>There was never any treaty.  Black on white violence has maintained at high levels during all that time.  The only thing that happened and which made a difference was the quite conscious decision on the part of the mainstream media to ignore, downplay, and memory-hole that violence.</p>
<p>In the trenches   &mdash;   in neighborhoods that undergo what sociologists amusingly call demographic transition, but which in reality is ethnic cleansing   &mdash;   there never has been anything remotely like said treaty.  Whites move out, not because of white flight, but because they have no means of successfully fighting back.  The government sure does not support us, and we instinctively know that it is not at all either representative or committed to justice.<br>

		<p>Well, nothing lasts forever. The truth cannot be covered up forever.</p>
<p>What does one suspect the current anti-government, uber-libertarian nature of the opposition is really about? Government and public sectors have been so corrupted by substandard minority incompetents that even good ideas that save money like universal health care (we spend almost 15% of GDP on health care, live 78.2 years, no civilized country in the world spends more than 10% GDP while all live several months to a few years longer) are shelved for two eminently understandable reasons.</p>
<p>1. They would be (mis)administered by incompetent minorities.</p>
<p>2. They would disproportionately benefit those already obnoxiously sponging off the productive.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s where it gets VERY interesting. Whites are waking up. The critical group of whites are those who wish to have a functional government but are increasingly making the connection between black incompetence and&hellip;</p>
<p>1. Wasted resources that frustrate desire for functional governance, and&hellip;</p>
<p>2. Legitimate white disgust at being forever threatened with violence and shaken down by incompetent violent blacks.</p>
<p>The new white nationalism will not be simply a rubber stamp anarchic corporatism. That garbage results in white middle class exploitation by a purely profit driven system that sells them downriver as surely as does affirmative action appeasement socialism. It also results in cultural degradation where any degenerate, trivial, pop-cultural lobotomizing fad enriches and glorifies the stupidest, most debased, lowest human common denominator.</p>
<p>No, American whites, along with many Asians and some Hispanics want a third option, a third way. A new form of folk fascism with democratic urges, where globe gallivanting forever wars are increasingly replaced with government/private great projects (mega-engineering schemes, space exploration and colonization, etc - great projects a people can be proud of that create employment while building something lasting and useful), where a qualified merit based civil service replaces the set-aside incompetence of our current system&hellip;</p>
<p>This is what white (and, largely, non-black) Americans will come to increasingly want and demand.</p>
<p>And with every outrage perpetrated on our sons and daughters by these oversexed, low IQ, violence prone blacks, non-black America sees blacks as increasingly increasingly unworthy of sympathy&hellip;</p>
<p>Until finally the notion of some kind of a &ldquo;race war&rdquo; that results in a better society becomes preferable to the inevitable societal collapse of duck speak multiculturalism.</p>
<p>Out of this will indeed arise a more or less Caucasian &ldquo;American race&rdquo; that will include some Hispanic, Asian, and even &ldquo;ten percenter&rdquo; African blood. Like it or not, the new American race will ultimately include some non-Caucasian input, but will be no less white than modern Italians, who at an average IQ of 103, are the smartest in Europe.</p>
<p>Vestigial communities of others will likely remain in geographically distinct areas and as long as they follow the rules and keep problems to themselves, who will care?</p>
<p>Ultimately the most important evolutionary struggle will not be between races so much as between &ldquo;homo superior&rdquo; and &ldquo;homo inferior&rdquo;, although obviously those members of races more likely to possess traits amenable to survival and progress will be among those more likely to survive and thrive as homo superior rather than languish or perish as homo inferior.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africans and those descended from them will be hard pressed indeed.</p>

		<p>RE 9 Sureesh&rsquo;s comment:<br>
Most likely there will be an increase in police state tactics done in a stealth mode, unreported by the MSM, which will get steadily less truthful and more ignored than ever. Gated community living will become the norm, in those unlucky places where blacks are a factor. Exurbs will be the last place of refuge for most. There will be no uprising by whites or other non black types simply because it would be repressed immediately.<br>
I think the South African experience ( I have never been there so I am simply guessing ) wherein crime is suppressed piecemeal and people live more or less on the edge all of the time, is in store for us.<br>
There may be a political sea change, however, if the ethos of China or Japan takes hold. A society, such as China&rsquo;s,  clearly leading the way into the next century carries a lot of weight in the manners and mores department. Societies, such as ours, headed towards permanent funk due to multicultural mindlessness, may start to seriously consider adopting a &#8220;homogeniety is where it&rsquo;s at&#8221; life style.<br>
Look for &#8220;People&#8221; magazine to change its name to &#8220;White People&#8221; or &#8220;People Just Like Us&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I disagree with the premise of this article.  Black violence against whites has been constant since the 1960&rsquo;s.  If it dropped at any point in a particular place, it was mainly because white flight made it harder for blacks to find victims as whites ceded public spaces and whole cities.  </p>
<p>The only thing that changed was the black nationalist ideology was no longer taken seriously.  By the 80&rsquo;s, black racist thugs were back to being nihilists. </p>
<p>NYC is somewhat different than the rest of the country because the rich leftists who live there demand that the police use harsh tactics against blacks that would never be tolerated anywhere else in the country.  </p>

<p>-  I wonder if enough are waking up, and how fast, because from where I&rsquo;m at, every other white girl is dating a black guy or dancing to hip hop like a hoochie, and at least 30-40% of the white boys imitate the hip hop/ black sports star idol thing.</p>
<p>I was at the mall yesterday and I saw so many white boys of all ages dressed in those fancy NBA sports clothes that ghetto thugs wear, replete with vacant stares, the socks with flip flops thing and even some of the mannerisms.</p>

		<p>Sadly, basic premises in this article are wrong. For example: </p>
<p>&#8220;Since the 1960s, with scant exceptions, this pay-off has been amazingly successful. Once common &ldquo;race war&rdquo; rhetoric (burn baby burn, the fire next time etc.) has virtually vanished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Umm NO. Have you ever heard of Rap &#8220;music&#8221;? This website contains a very long list of the type of violence that has been drummed into blacks&rsquo; dim brains for years. Police Assassination, killing of White babies, shooting White homeowners in home invasions, rape as a tool of war, wholesale murder of the type in the Rwanda genocide, etc. are all general themes in this form of black entertainment. The hate was right there in our faces, except that many of us didn&rsquo;t speak &#8220;Jive&#8221; so we did not know that the &#8220;Boom, Boom&#8221; from the hooptie next to us at the light was talking about killing crackers.</p>
<p>Then there is the White/black Rape rate, at 37,000 to zero. 37,000 is a big number, about the number of US dead in all the Vietnam war or the number of dead in Automobile Accidents in the USA in a year. About 100 per day. That is an amazing number. It is not an accident, it is policy. War Policy. Psychologists like to say that rape is anger and desire to control. Well, Black rape of our women is anger and the desire to control White Women.</p>
<p>It is my belief that a underground civil war has been brewing for the last 50 years, with academia and the media doing everything it can to cover the facts, distorting statistics and vilifying anyone who speaks up. The great change has been the internet. People believe their eyes and the cop videos and security feeds are appalling. White guilt, so long taught, is burning away leaving a rage.</p>

Now that blacks have experienced greater given opportunities they have become dishonorable in pursuit of decadence and have abandoned their own offspring leaving behind a tribal menace.<br>
It is time to come to terms with the genetic shortcomings of blacks so that future generations of Americans will not be exposed to senseless violence on American soil.<br>
If blacks continue to tailor their culture and racial pathologies to white culture, America will continue facing random and cyclical acts of violence only to place the next generation of productive white citizens in harms way.<br>
It is time for the world to come together and create a new way of thinking for blacks and one that is tailored to their biology so that Africans will one say be influenced to be self-sufficient and responsible for the maintainence of African civilization.</p>

		<p>Interesting premise, but what the hell does the author mean by nothing can be done re this violence? What cowardice is that!!!!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what can be done:</p>
<p>Eliminate flash mobs - in two ways. A white president can state publicly that he will issue immediate presidential pardons to any person using lethal violence to defend himself against mob &#8216;hate&rsquo; attacks. That will encourage persons to violate gun bans and a few good defense responses will go viral on the internet.</p>
<p>Second, we can push for legislation to bring back the death penalty for murder, and also for criminal mob attacks. Good public hangings will send salutary messages.</p>
<p>All white men must heavily arm themselves. Race war will not be initiated by us, but it will be directed at us. The coming war will be one of pure good vs pure evil. Be prepared.</p>

<p>I believe this as well. However, the last 2-3 decades has added another element: The Mexicans. <br>
I believe there will be decades of increased race wars between blacks and Latinos. For the Whites, we have a number of choices to make. We can join the blacks (that won&rsquo;t happen), join the Mexicans (I will and others will who believe as I do), or stand to the side/hide away (many will be doing that). <br>
This country is done either way. Due to population alone, it&rsquo;s not possible to reverse itself REALISTICALLY. <br>
As I&rsquo;ve said many times, at least the Mexicans will give blacks a taste of their own medicine, as they have been doing to them since the early 90s. Blacks were going to take over without question (thanks to the White liberals of course). <br>
In another 100-200 years I predict this country will indeed be an ongoing country-wide race war zone between blacks and Latinos. Also, by the time most/all of the liberals wake up, it will be too late. <br>
Only the richest of Whites will be okay, if hidden far enough away with large electrical fences and guards on the premises.<br>
Until then, all we can honestly do is live where we believe we will be safest. <br>

<p>I am sick to death of trying to make Rajneesh (or his family) at the Dairy Queen understand that I want a chocolate covered strawberry blizzard. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. So I no longer allow myself that tiny luxury. I&rsquo;m livid at trying to make Pramod (or his family) understand that I have an ink stain in my favorite wool jacket I want cleaned. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;m furious at trying to check in a motel and have to make Kalpesh (or his family) understand that I want a king bed. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. So I go down the street to the next one. I&rsquo;m infuriated at trying to make Bhadresh (or his family) understand the difference between a bell pepper and a banana pepper at a Subway, so I won&rsquo;t patronize them anymore. I&rsquo;m beyond disgusted at trying to find a gas station/convenience store that is owned by an American, and not Jaldeep or his family members.</p>
<p>And the reason all this grates on me is: This is MY country. I&rsquo;M THE ONE who should be eligible for low interest business loans and tax exemptions that allow me to purchase a business cheaper than you or Pramod or Bhadresh. The unfairness of the benefits your residency here gives you makes you my business competition, with me at a distinct and extreme disadvantage the moment you set foot in MY country. I detest it and I WILL NOT reward your people and cut my own throat by patronizing their businesses.</p>

<p>How right you are.  My uncle built his own house in Miami in 1955.  It was a beautiful white neighborhood with children everywhere, playing and enjoying the liberty to roam about.  I know, I grew up there.  As the march of blacks from miles away came towards this neighborhood, my parents moved out of their house in 1959 that was one block away from my uncle.  They saw it coming.  My uncle, stubborn in that it was his house, stayed into the 1970s.  All the while, most of the folks that I knew in that neighborhood moved out.  Blacks started moving in, buoyed by lending programs, church and charity handouts.  Houses that never had locked doors were now being broken into, bicycles that had previously were left out overnight were either locked all the time or went missing, vandalism, never known before became an everyday event. Then came the verbal threats to get out of &#8220;their hood&#8221; and shortly after, the physical attacks.  First it was the old whites and then the young children, ripe for beatdowns, then everyone white was a target.  In the meantime, rapes for the first time ever, began.  It was beyond disgusting, it was frightening.  The police were not any help, beyond telling white people to leave.  Finally, my brother being a realtor, got a nice house for my aunt and uncle to live in, some 20 miles north in a white neighborhood.  His house was sold and he moved out just in time.  His neighbor in back was murdered the day he sold his house.</p>
<p>Not enough space here to tell the dozens of stories of other whites who were robbed, beaten, threatened and terrorized but Scott you are right, it&rsquo;s ethnic cleansing full throttle.  And rather than get this monster under control, we are feeding it, encouraging it to grow all the while ignoring its greater and greater crimes.  </p>

<p>Given that the radicals are Leftist/communist, it should be no surprise that they follow Chairman Mao&rsquo;s dictum on Revolution and War. They are not going to come out into the open until they are confident of winning. We need them to overplay their hand so we can reasonably deal with them with sufficient and effective force. Events are rapidly enabling them to believe that they are ridding a rising wave and that wave will be unopposed.</p>
<p>Personally, I am glad that the &#8220;treaty&#8221; is broken. Perhaps now we will stop keeping our end of the bad bargain too. Resolve the matter directly and historically, in the same way that such matters have always and ultimately and finally resolved. </p>
<p>The sooner the better.</p>
<p>Cut off the gimmies and the giveaways and build barricades to stand behind. In a few wild days, the problem will be over.<br>

<p>#62 10mm AUTO - &ldquo;It is my belief that a underground civil war has been brewing for the last 50 years&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this as well. However, the last 2-3 decades has added another element: The Mexicans.<br>
I believe there will be decades of increased race wars between blacks and Latinos. For the Whites, we have a number of choices to make. We can join the blacks (that won&rsquo;t happen), join the Mexicans (I will and others will who believe as I do), or stand to the side/hide away (many will be doing that).<br>
This country is done either way. Due to population alone, it&rsquo;s not possible to reverse itself REALISTICALLY.<br>
As I&rsquo;ve said many times, at least the Mexicans will give blacks a taste of their own medicine, as they have been doing to them since the early 90s. Blacks were going to take over without question (thanks to the White liberals of course).<br>
In another 100-200 years I predict this country will indeed be an ongoing country-wide race war zone between blacks and Latinos. Also, by the time most/all of the liberals wake up, it will be too late.<br>
Only the richest of Whites will be okay, if hidden far enough away with large electrical fences and guards on the premises.<br>
Until then, all we can honestly do is live where we believe we will be safest. &#8220;</p>
<p>There has been an on again, off again, war by Mexicans against whites for a long, long time.  Look up the San Diego Plan of 1915 for a start.  Review the race riots during WW2 that occurred all over the country, as well as gang activities from then on like the Pachucos, Chichanos, etc.  I grew up in the SW and there has always been an anti-white element in Mexicans and Hispanics in general, even if there was some moderation of it among some individuals along with it.  (I mean that I had a few Mexican friends growing up who were really okay, there are just too many now).  As numbers have increased, civil attacks against whites have increased, but the tendency has long existed for political and racial reasons.</p>
<p>I think you are both too optimistic and deferential regarding the future.  I don&rsquo;t think this country will last another 100 years, nor will the world be as it is now.  There won&rsquo;t be electricity for those electric fences of the rich.  A generation or two of people will have to learn how survive without computers or even cell phones.  No matter how you feel about this issues around global warming, the oceans are acidifying quicker, human population crises is growing quickly, the inevitable economic world wide crash that we are only getting glimpse of today (because it is inevitable), will result in chaos and wars soon.  Hospitals won&rsquo;t be able to handle the fallout and epidemics and pandemics will cause massive panic and deaths, right at home and in your face.  </p>
<p>This hasn&rsquo;t been predicted by me alone, but by some of the world&rsquo;s leading scientists for a long time, like Issac Asimov in 1980.  Their predictions have only been confirmed so far, and they are based on mathematical certainties.  If any human life makes it through the resultant biological grind, it will be small and its survival dependent upon basic living skills, like farming, along with the ability to cooperate with others.  (I&rsquo;ve met guys who think that they will go into the hills and live by hunting.  All they will do is end up shooting each other).  This time the smartest (and best prepared) will survive.</p>

Sharpton (nice gig at MSNBC!) has encouraged violence and riots in the past in NYC.  The vile NYC councilman Charles Barron is a radical revolutionary.

		<p>79; I believe that your estimate is off by a magnitude of at least ten if not one hundred. I do not think we have even 100 months before something slips. </p>
<p>Imagine this; Aug. 11, 2012 -by this time it will be obvious that Obama is not going to be re-elected and -after a second long summer of ever increasing &#8216;flash-mob&rsquo; violence, something happens. It will not take much, like for example three LAPD officers shoot an armed mexican national, aged 15 years and a member of MS-13 -who has shot at them and led them on pursuit in a stolen car. Naturally, the brown berets take to the streets in &#8216;protest&rsquo;. Aug 12, shortly after midnight ethnic violence flares up in Watts or some other contested ghetto/colonia, leading into full blown &#8216;flash-riots&rsquo; as social media is used by both sides to co-ordinate attacks against eachother and other enclaves (like Korean merchants or walled, gated communities &#8216;where all de money at&rsquo;) <br>
Aug 12, Governor Jerry Brown calls out the Calif Natnl Guard, but they encounter barricades and overwhelming resistance as the mexican cartels flood the area with supplies and weapons for their co-nationals. Street to street fighting ensues, covered live on CNN as the mayhem starts to spread nationally. Beverly Hills is besieged and/or looted, with firefights reported on Rodeo Drive and Disney Stores across the nation.<br>
Aug 13, Obama declares a state of national emergency, &#8216;temporarily&rsquo; voiding posse commitatus and the bill of rights, while using the power of the Patriot Act to suspend all local and national elections until the &#8216;emergency&rsquo; is over.<br>
Aug. 13, 14:17; CNN shows ethnic minority Police in Newark or Orlando actively participating in the looting of local businesses, while store owners try to defend their meager inventories from the rooftops. An officer interviewed states &#8220;dey&rsquo;s shootin&rsquo; at us, and we&rsquo;s the Po-lice, it&rsquo;s just lawless here&hellip;&#8221; before pushing his shopping cart of TV&rsquo;s and high dollar shoes toward a waiting patrol car.</p>
<p>Just a scenario, purely hypothetical&hellip;</p>

		<p>i notice a lot of comments where people mention ccw permits etc. this tells me whites are more fearful of being prosecuted for defending oneself with deadly force than an actual attack itself. i feel this is wrongheaded and whites should defend themselves and not worry about being charged. also i hear its better to use deadly force because assault carries heaver penalties than manslaughter if you were charged. just saying </p>

<p>Can you name the source? If it is true, it is most likely because the cream of Indians migrate to the US, followed by UK and Canada. Those who cannot make it to those emmigrate to Australia/NZ, in other words, the bottom of the barrel. They are invariably from rural Punjab, an Indian state with a population with Scythian lineage, known for their nutty and sometimes hot-headed behavior.</p>

<p>Sureesh, again, let me enlighten you:</p>
<p>I am sick to death of trying to make Rajneesh (or his family) at the Dairy Queen understand that I want a chocolate covered strawberry blizzard. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. So I no longer allow myself that tiny luxury. I&rsquo;m livid at trying to make Pramod (or his family) understand that I have an ink stain in my favorite wool jacket I want cleaned. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. I&rsquo;m furious at trying to check in a motel and have to make Kalpesh (or his family) understand that I want a king bed. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. So I go down the street to the next one. I&rsquo;m infuriated at trying to make Bhadresh (or his family) understand the difference between a bell pepper and a banana pepper at a Subway, so I won&rsquo;t patronize them anymore. I&rsquo;m beyond disgusted at trying to find a gas station/convenience store that is owned by an American, and not Jaldeep or his family members.</p>
<p>And the reason all this grates on me is: This is MY country. I&rsquo;M THE ONE who should be eligible for low interest business loans and tax exemptions that allow me to purchase a business cheaper than you or Pramod or Bhadresh. The unfairness of the benefits your residency here gives you makes you my business competition, with me at a distinct and extreme disadvantage the moment you set foot in MY country. I detest it and I WILL NOT reward your people and cut my own throat by patronizing their businesses.</p>
<p>If you are correct and your people are so industrious, so well educated and such wonderful people to live among, why aren&rsquo;t you busy building and enjoying your own country? You&rsquo;re costing me and my fellow Americans millions of dollars, and I don&rsquo;t appreciate it or you one bit.<br>

<p>I agree 100%!!! </p>
<p>They will never go back to their own countries and build a decent civilization because they don&rsquo;t know how, it&rsquo;s not in their DNA. They aren&rsquo;t that smart, as Sureesh constantly tries to tells us they are. </p>
<p>Have you seen the areas they move into and the ONCE nice homes they have destroyed? Landscaping is in shambles with weeds and dried out lawns now dotting their front and back yards.</p>
<p>NO nonwhite will voluntarily leave America, they will have to be forced. They have it way too good here feeding off our race and OUR civilization. We are stupid to even allow it in the first place.</p>
<p>I also NEVER give any nonwhite my business. There is one old White man that still has his service station and even comes out to the car and puts the gas in and cleans the windows and checks the air, water and oil! That is on the &#8220;self serve&#8221; side.</p>
<p>Remember the good ole days where they would fix you car and pump your gas?  ALL White owned, of course, when America was 90% White.</p>

<p>Beer summits over race are always phoney. Haven&rsquo;t we already witnessed one before?&#8221;</p>
<p>It appears that quite a few posters misinterpreted my stated interest in sitting down with Sureesh and sharing a few beers.</p>
<p>The main point of such a gesture would be to have the opportunity to hear a non-white (Indian in this case) try, with a straight face,  to explain to a white male descendant of the Founding Stock of this nation how he and his fellow non-white invaders of our homelands could develop, form, and hold the opinion that Whites should not be allowed or expected to resist having their nation stolen from them.   Believe me, as I&rsquo;ve said before - this attitude is pervasive among the hordes of non-whites who&rsquo;ve been allowed to flood into our nation since 1965.    Fareed Zakaria and Reuben Navarrette, two non-white journalists, spout this line of arrogant baloney all the time in their columns that touch on the immigration topic.  </p>
<p>I truly am curious as to where this attitude and mentally twisted frame of mind originates, and I would really like to hear one of these non-whites who think this way to explain to me how they managed to arrive at this opinion.  </p>
<p>This is equivalent to having a homeless bum break into your home - and because you feel a little sorry for him, don&rsquo;t kick him out right away and change the locks on your doors.  Instead,<br>
you allow your misplaced feelings of altruism and decency to persuade you to let this bum hang around for a few months.    And, along about month number 6 or so, you arrive home from work one day and the bum has changed the locks on the doors to your home, has his name plate attached to your mailbox - and greets you at the door and announces that you no longer have a right to claim ownership of your home and property, and now he is the new owner.   </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the kind of mental gymnastics I would like to hear explained to me by Sureesh. </p>

		<p>To be blunt, many of these non-whites our racial and political enemies in Washinton flooded into our nation will never leave on their own. They won&rsquo;t as long as there is wealth for them to steal, or whites to rape, rob and kill. Nor will their home nations ever take them back, the governments there pushed them off on us. That leaves only two choices, when the racial civil wars start here. One is to kill every one of them who will not leave through war or ethnic cleanising. Two is to break up the U.S. into mutually hostile ethnostates, which will then be vulnerable to attack from China, the Islamic world, or both. It will be forced upon us with no other options possible.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure there are Hispanics who have attacked Whites. Too bad all I here about or see is black attacking Whites, Hispanics and Asains. Go on youtube and you&rsquo;ll see a lot of various races who have attacked one another lol.<br>

		<p>Logically, all this should indicate that liberalism has been an abject failure. We have seen every last liberal program implemented over the last five decades, and yet we end up with massive dysfunction in the black community and a new wave of urban guerrilla warfare against whites. </p>
<p>The issue is: are the flash mobs politically motivated? Are they part of a more general offensive against white people? Is the situation akin to that in the new rainbow nation of South Africa with its farm attacks and chanting of &#8220;Kill the Boer, kill the farmer?&#8221; How much of this is the result or multicultist media, academia and race hustlers stirring up blacks against whites? <br>
  <br>
This is why we need to look not at simply defending against black on white mob violence, but discrediting the ideologues behind it. One suspects that the multicultists <i>want  </i> whites and blacks to duke it out in the streets, because it then justifies more liberal programs and power. Liberalism, as the reigning ideology in the Western world, has gotta go!</p>
<p><i>At that time the police had communications capabilities that the youths did not.</i></p>
<p>Cell phones, the internet, et alia give networked insurgents an edge over traditionally organized government forces. This has been a real dilemma in the war on terror. It&rsquo;s also a factor in the ability of urban rioters and flash mobsters to organize. They can &#8220;move&#8221; faster than the police. Whether or not this will lead to further urban insurgency remains to be seen. But it ought to be a lesson learned for people who want to organize defense against urban violence. </p>

<p>To me, it&rsquo;s just following my instincts and feeling the most danger warning alarms when I&rsquo;m in the company of blacks. I rarely sense the same level of hostility from Hispanics or whomever.</p>
<p>But, I now that they bring their own customs with them and I don&rsquo;t want the U.S. to be United States of Mexico either. I&rsquo;ve met some that are pretty good people, but they aren&rsquo;t what I know and value the most.</p>

<p>No, I don&rsquo;t &#8220;hate&#8221; all nonwhites. I even know a couple that I like and speak with. BUT, as a different RACIAL GROUP (a collective) when they are in my country by the millions and climbing, then I can say I am close to &#8220;hating&#8221; them. Gee, don&rsquo;t you ever READ the Bible about love and hate? You know, &#8220;a time to love and a time to hate, a time to be born and a time to die&#8221;?  You think we are &#8220;suppose&#8221; to &#8220;love everybody&#8221; and those that are hurting us and OUR nation?  Even God Almighty &#8220;hates&#8221; if you will read your Bible correctly.</p>
<p>It is time for YOU, not me, to face reality. I faced it about 30 years ago. </p>
<p>Too bad you don&rsquo;t live where I do and watch the local news everyday. You might change your mind about the so-called &#8220;hispanics&#8221;. Too bad you didn&rsquo;t watch the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; protesting in the streets and yelling racial slurs at Whitey and flipping them off, pounding on their cars in traffic, and saying they are taking &#8220;their&#8221; land back. Too bad you don&rsquo;t go and sit at the welfare office on any given day and &#8220;see&#8221; what goes on.  </p>
<p>BTW, I know a lot of Italians. Grew up around them and the ones I know sure do not feel as you do about the &#8220;hispanics&#8221;. </p>

		<p>103 Anonymous - I know there are too many Hispanics in this country. I never said otherwise. I just haven&rsquo;t experienced what certain people have and vica versa. For me, reality is this country has changed, so how do we go about things. As for us Italians, we don&rsquo;t have a love for Hispanics and us Italians used to pick on the Puerto Ricans here in NY back in the 80s. Guess what though, they don&rsquo;t bother us any. Guess who&rsquo;s still a BIG problem? Blacks. Oh, and the Mexicans over here cause no trouble either. I know they are different over on the West, but they also hates blacks so I think it gives us some kind of fighting chance. Again, we&rsquo;re not doing anything about it, that&rsquo;s for sure. <br>
It all doesn&rsquo;t matter. Whatever happens will happens in the end. I just know there will be many future race wars between blacks and Hispanics and I&rsquo;ll be rooting for the Hispanics (and ANY other non black race). Others can do no rooting or root for the blacks. It won&rsquo;t change the outcome of it anyhow. </p>

<p>I will root for neither group. I only concentrate on my own race, kindred, tribe as it was meant to be from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>I could care less what blacks/browns do to each other. I want both groups out of this country. If not, then this country will not be worth living in any longer and it surely will become a scenario of Mad Max and worse for White people.</p>
<p>You are lucky you do not live around all these Mexicans YET. They are spreading out all across America in high numbers. They will be pouring in where you live also, then you will get a true picture of who and what they are. I believe Amren had an article on here not long ago about this very thing.</p>

		<p>Sureesh, the reason you get it is two fold.</p>
<p>One, far market reasons, our immigrants from India have been heavily selected for intelligence.</p>
<p>Two, there aren&rsquo;t enough South Asians in the US  to from a &#8220;critical mass&#8221; of a separate community.  When you&rsquo;re a small enough minority it&rsquo;s much more likely you&rsquo;ll conform.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Anonymous 97, nope, nice try. I&rsquo;m not Hispanic. Sono Italiano Americano :O) (I&rsquo;m an Italian American) who doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with Hispanics, Asians, etc. If you read all my posts you&rsquo;d get that. I&rsquo;m guessing you hate every single non white person. Maybe even Italians (American born) like me?? <br>
I bet you have one of those genius, realistic plans of fighting &ldquo;every non white person and taking back this country&rdquo;. <br>
I&rsquo;m sure there are Hispanics who have attacked Whites. Too bad all I here about or see is black attacking Whites, Hispanics and Asains. Go on youtube and you&rsquo;ll see a lot of various races who have attacked one another lol.<br>
I&rsquo;m focusing on the majority of attacks that are not interracial and it&rsquo;s the SAME pattern as it has been for DECADES now.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no place in the pro-white movement for people who don&rsquo;t like blacks but otherwise think massive immigration of non-whites is okay. </p>

		<p>ATBOTL and Anon 105 - I do understand. I just know two things for certain: <br>
1) The Hispanics, who ARE way too many without question, are here to stay. So, I try to look at any positives. One of those positives would be how they are doing to the blacks as the blacks have done to us. Sorry but that makes happy. I just wish we would follow suit. I wish we would stand up for ourselves more. I wish we would file law suits against blacks just as the Hispanics have (against blacks) in LA when they realized blacks had all the city-held positions even though they did not make up the majority of the population (with the shifts in population over the years). We should be doing the same!<br>
2) Blacks attack or kill one of us at least once a day, everyday somewhere around the country. Besides everything else, these flash mob attacks, etc make blacks a far worse threat than any other group as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. </p>
<p>Again, all of it doesn&rsquo;t matter anyway. This country is done and the NUMBER ONE reason is liberals. </p>
