<p>Isaac Arnsdorf, Washington Post, August 18, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>President Obama on Thursday issued an executive order requiring government agencies to develop plans for improving federal workforce diversity.</p>
<p>The administration has had diversity on its radar for a while and last year said it would take steps to build a more varied workforce. In fiscal 2009, according the federal government, white men held more than 61 percent of senior pay-level positions among workers. The long-awaited executive order marks the highest-profile response to what has been a perennial concern.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The details of the initiative have yet to be worked out. Instead of creating a new administrative body, as did Obama&rsquo;s 2009 executive order on veterans&rsquo; employment, the diversity initiative will lean on a council of deputy agency chiefs, along with the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p>That group will be responsible for creating a government-wide plan within 90 days. According to the order, after the government-wide plan is released, each agency must present its own specific plan for diversity within 120 days. {snip}</p>
