			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), August 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police have released video from a McDonald&rsquo;s security camera that shows a police officer&rsquo;s final act of kindness shortly before he was killed in a random act of violence.</p>
<p>The video clip shows Officer Jeremy Henwood paying for a 10-year-old boy&rsquo;s meal at a McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant in the San Diego, California, neighbourhood that he patrolled. </p>
<p>Several minutes after Mr Henwood left the McDonald&rsquo;s, 23-year-old Dejon White pulled up behind his patrol car in a black Audi and flashed his lights.</p>
<p>Mr Henwood pulled over and White pulled alongside, rolled down his passenger-side window and shot the officer in the head with a shotgun.</p>
<p>The incident happened on Saturday August 6.</p>
<p>Mr Henwood died from his injuries the next day, Fox 5 San Diego reports.</p>
<p>At a candlelight memorial for Mr Henwood last Thursday night, San Diego Police Chief William Lansdowne told attendees that Henwood&rsquo;s last act of kindness showed what sort of man he was.</p>
<p>Mr Lansdowne said: &#8216;The boy had some coins in his hand. Jeremy couldn&rsquo;t make out how much, but it was clear that he didn&rsquo;t have enough for the food that he wanted.</p>
<p>&#8216;Without a word a word being spoken, Jeremy bought the food and handed it to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>White fled after mortally wounding Henwood, but police tracked him down a short time later and killed him when he tried to flee.</p>
<p>After searching White&rsquo;s apartment, police said that they found a two-page suicide note.</p>
<p>Investigators have said that they can determine no motive for the shooting of the police officer.</p>
<p>Before the weekend&rsquo;s shooting White was described as a &#8216;petty criminal&rsquo;, and he had previously resisted arrest and performed minor thefts.</p>
<p>The suicide letter did not inform readers as to how he was going to kill himself, or for what reasons, however he was linked to another shooting on Saturday  &mdash;  before Mr Henwood was shot dead.</p>
<p>Outside an In-N-Out Burger restaurant located in El Cajon, 14 miles away from where the police officer was gunned down, Martin Hanna was shot at point-blank range  &mdash;  while in his car sitting with his girlfriend  &mdash;  with a shotgun.</p>
<p>Police were trying to determine whether there was any link between White and Mr Hanna, who is expected to recover, though he is still in a critical condition.</p>
<p>The alleged shooter is then believed to have sped away in an Audi car and he was travelling so quickly that he caught the attention of a patrol car, who gave chase yet was unable to keep up with the vehicle, which was reported to have been moving at over 100 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Witnesses to Mr Henwood&rsquo;s shooting used the dying officer&rsquo;s radio to call for assistance and performed first aid until paramedics arrived and took him to hospital.</p>
<p>Mr Henwood, who leaves behind his parents, a brother and a sister, was also a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and had recently returned from a one-year deployment to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>He had been serving in the police force for four years and was the second San Diego officers to die in action in only 10 months.</p>
<p>In October last year Christopher Wilson, a 17-year department veteran, was killed in a shoot-out, along with two other people.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old father-of-two was the first San Diego officer to be killed in the line of duty in more than six years.</p>

		<p>Not sure why the article says &#8220;without a word being spoken&#8221; the black child stands next to the police officer at the counter while the officer is ordering and they are talking to each other. The black kid was probably intentionally trying to get the officer to buy his meal.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of my own close encounter with a couple of pint-sized black thugs about a year ago. I was walking down Juniper Street in Center City Philadelphia - not far from City Hall - in broad daylight when two giggling pubescents jumped out from behind a parked van, pointed a nickel-plated revolver at me, and demanded my wallet. These two rugrats looked about 12 at most but I could tell that their gun was very real. I handed over a wallet devoid of credit cards, personal ID, or anything but about 6 one-dollar bills. They took it and ran off. I honestly think that I was more stunned by their youth than I was scared about the hold-up itself. Only the worst was yet to come. When I found  two black police officers in City Hall courtyard a few minutes later and told them what had happened, they gave me looks that clearly read, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t bother me. I&rsquo;m busy&#8221; One of them actually smirked and said, &#8220;So what you&rsquo;re telling me is, you lost six bucks.&#8221; THIS felt like a worse violation than the stick-up! I just muttered &#8220;Forget it!&#8221; and walked away. I could hear them laughing behind me as I walked off and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever felt more outraged or humiliated in my life. To this day, I don&rsquo;t know what I did wrong in this situation or how I could have handled it better.<br>
   No wonder smart people avoid Philadelphia!</p>

		<p>The recent spate of white cop killings by black thugs began a couple of years ago with the four officers murdered in the coffee shop near Seattle.  </p>
<p>I believe that Die-versity training contributed greatly to the  killing of these four white cops, and to the deaths of other white officers across the country.  This training has the effect of brainwashing street cops to ignore the greater criminal threat posed by blacks.</p>
<p>Cop training consists of hours of instruction on the equality of man twaddle.  Couple this with the disgusting training influence by the $PLC which distributes anti-hate courses and propaganda to LE; state, local and Federal. Police chiefs and supervisors eat this up as a way to show the &#8220;minority&#8221; community that they really love blacks and Mexicans. </p>
<p>All this influences cops to develop a non-racial profiling view that causes them to ignore obvious threats from thug blacks. Those cops who know better likely avoid blacks as much as possible and make their bones on hapless and non-threatening whites, all the way to fat retirement.  They know that messing with blacks is a zero-zero game.</p>
<p>The poor cop in this article got a double dose of Die-versity brainwashing, what with being in the modern day corrected Marine Corps. Undoubtedly at his eulogy there were fine words spoken about his love for his fellowman and belief in the inherent goodness of all people. </p>
<p>Of course this murder will be held as having nothing to do with race whatsoever. Dejon was just a misguided yoooot and great afleak who couldn&rsquo;t catch a break, or even have success with white girls which he so much deserved. Then there were those pesky racist tests in school that prevented his success&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The black community in the area where this killing happened will view it as a strike against the &#8220;oppressors&#8221;. In all these killings the black community stands in solidarity with the murderers.  In the Seattle cop killings blacks were uncooperative and refused to help police find the killer. They even actively hid him. </p>
<p>But black leaders (extortionists) will howl about the non-enforcement of laws in the black parts of the city. Demands will go forth about the need for more black cops and &#8220;monies&#8221; for community rebuilding and bringing opportunity to disadvantaged yoophs.  </p>
<p>Oakland CA is a case in point.  Not too long ago a white transit cop accidentally shot and killed a black yooph who was creating a disturbance on the subway. Blacks went crazy over this and now Oakland is without cop services except in the most extreme crimes. Auto thief? Petty burglary? Forget about it.  Murder? Maybe the cops with answer. I can guarantee the investigation will be haphazard.            </p>
<p>Dejon White would have been sentenced to death had he not died in a shootout. But since it&rsquo;s California he would have croaked of old age on death row, that is if a thug in black robes didn&rsquo;t free him first.  </p>
<p>If this happened in Texas, and had Dejon lived, he would have been executed within five to ten years.   </p>
<p>White people&rsquo;s answer to black racist criminality?  Hold  candle light vigils. <br>

		<p>To most White people, the officer&rsquo;s last action was seen as an act of kindness, but Blacks won&rsquo;t see it that way. They never do. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many acts of generosity we show to Blacks, they don&rsquo;t appreciate it. They just see it as something that Whites are supposed to do. </p>
<p>Every time I&rsquo;m in a Black neighborhood, I inevitably get hit up for money by Blacks and it&rsquo;s gotten to the point that they don&rsquo;t even ask nicely; they demand it. &#8220;Give me a dolla!&#8221; When you say no, they act shocked and angered. &#8220;It&rsquo;s jus a dolla! You don&rsquo;t have a dolla?!&#8221; </p>
<p>What this good hearted officer did may seem kindly, but all he did was train a future thug to expect free things from Whitey.</p>

		<p>Gunfire deaths of American cops are up by 21% this year. To discover the assailant&rsquo;s race, I often google the particulars, then click google &#8220;images&#8221;, if the newspaper accounts have omitted photos.</p>
<p>Blacks are disproportionately noted as the killers of white cops, from the little research I&rsquo;ve completed.</p>
<p>116 on-duty cop deaths have occurred since Jan. 2011, and it&rsquo;s only August. You can easily find this information at the <a href="http://www.odmp.org/search/year/2011?ref=sidebar" rel="nofollow">Officer Down Memorial Page</a> for any year.</p>

<p>I have to sit through that nonsense before the end of the year. It makes me gag from the stench. But I only have six months to retirement. So I will smile, tug the forelock, and <i>never, ever</i> trust another black person for the rest of my life. Not that I have,anyway.</p>

		<p>I attended the officer&rsquo;s memorial service outdoors, along with over a thousand other people. Everything was translated into Spanish, because there were at least as many hispanics there as whites. The PA system used by the main speakers was poor, but the translations were loud and clear so that&rsquo;s how I heard the story about the encounter at McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Outrage that such a valuable member of the community had had his life taken by such a worthless piece of excrement was palpable. There were perhaps half a dozen blacks at the service, aside from police officers, and I got the distinct feeling that they weren&rsquo;t welcome. Not sure why there was such a large enthusiastic hispanic presence, or how much to read into it, but aside from the obnoxious pauses for translation into Spanish it was beautiful to see.</p>

<p><br>
Prejudice is not ugly.  Prejudice is beautiful. Prejudice is good.  Prejudice is life saving<br>
<p><br>
Intelligent people are prejudice.  What the enemies of White people are fabricating is an anti-White people prejudice that runs counter to our healthy natural prejudice.<br>
<p><br>
Yes we have a natural Prejudice against Blacks and other non-Whites, but what the police and American Renaissance readers have is no longer a prejudice, but a logical conclusion drawn from facts and valid premises.<br>

		<p>I stopped giving money to pathetic little black kids around 1958 when I was about 16 years old.  I lived in the rural suburbs of Chicago. There were no nice clothing stores, so we shopped in Chicago.</p>
<p>About age 16 I sometimes went alone, taking the train that connected to the Chicago subway and getting out on State street where all the big department stores were.  I would also walk to Michigan Ave and other shopping areas. A pathetic little black kid asked me for a quarter for bus fare home so I gave it to him.  </p>
<p>I soon noticed that downtown was full of pathetic little black kids as young as 7 asking White people for 25 cents bus fare home.  As soon as I noticed that I never gave anything to black kids again although I was always asked.</p>
<p>I knew that bus and subway fare was 25 cents.  I didn&rsquo;t realize that children under 12 like those begging kids paid only 5 cents at the time.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that pathetic little black kid pulls that trick all the time.</p>

		<p>This story, in fact, every story on this site&hellip; no, just about everything in American life right now points to the terrible question pointed to by Michael Levin in 1995. </p>
<p>Are the various races all equally capable of morality? This, even more than intelligence, is the question. </p>
<p>If the answer is yes, America needs to double down, tough it out, and continue on its present course. </p>
<p>If the answer is no, then that course will result in our utter destruction. </p>

		<p>Post 14 &#8220;Not sure why there was such a large enthusiastic hispanic presence,&#8221;</p>
<p>Hispanics are on the front lines. Remember, starting in the 1980&rsquo;s they had no choice but to move into black ghettoes.  They were abused in schools and in danger all the time.</p>
<p>Now those neighborhoods are mostly hispanic and they are reasonably safe and civilized.  The older ones did very well in real estate.  They bought almost worthless houses and even with the real estate disaster their houses are worth much, much more than they were when the hispanics first moved in.</p>
<p>Hispanics always side with Whites and others against blacks.</p>

		<p>Just like in South Africa, when the whites start looking soft the blacks will start acting up.  Unfortunately, whites take abuses silently when it comes to racial issues.  As such, blacks are now protected species under the so called anti-hate laws.</p>

<p>But the thing, is it is NOT ever good for any White to offer anything to a black or any other NONwhite. Altruism is a White trait meant FOR Whites only. Problem is Whites have spread their altruism and kindness throughout the whole world. That is total suicide. </p>
<p> I believe there is something in the archives here at amren about this very thing.  </p>

<p>Hispanics are on the front lines. Remember, starting in the 1980&rsquo;s they had no choice but to move into black ghettoes. They were abused in schools and in danger all the time.</p>
<p>Now those neighborhoods are mostly hispanic and they are reasonably safe and civilized. The older ones did very well in real estate. They bought almost worthless houses and even with the real estate disaster their houses are worth much, much more than they were when the hispanics first moved in.</p>
<p>Hispanics always side with Whites and others against blacks.<br>

<p>When will this nonsense stop? &#8220;hispanics&#8221; are our enemy also and I don&rsquo;t buy what you are saying. I sure must see a different side of hispanics than you do. There are plenty of crimes that hispanics commit every day and their gangs are so out of control that I have to wonder about these posters here who seem to elevate hispanics &#8220;as good for Whites&#8221; when in reality they are not. </p>
<p>Maybe some of the older ones who have been here for generations may be okay, but I still don&rsquo;t want them in my country. They can go to Mexico and show them how to create a civilization from what they have learned from US. </p>
<p>Have you not read here on amren about the &#8220;hispanics&#8221;? </p>

		<p>  In my experience cops, at least the Southern ones are among the most race conscious segment of our society. After all, it is their sacred duty to flush the toilet of criminally harmful elements, so that the criminals go down the sewer, rather than onto the floor of our society. </p>
<p>Do some cops abuse their powers? Of course, some do, but most don&rsquo;t.  Compared to the corrupt and prehensile Latin America police, most of our regular cops are models of honesty and trustworthiness. Some big city cops, like N.O. and Philadelphia, resemble their slippery Latin cousins much more than your average medium size city or small town Southern, Middle American policeman. <br>

<p>Whites &amp; Hispanics regularly form temporary alliances against blacks in prisons. The term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is in fact very broadly used. There are white Hispanics, brown Hispanics &amp; black Hispanics. The problem in the Southwest US is that way too many illegal immigrants are coming in from Mexico and not assimilating into Americans. On the other hand, Cuban Americans in South Florida, have largely assimilated and identify as Americans. The problem in America right now is black thug culture. I will welcome anyone as an ally  who wishes to preserve the greatness of Western Civilization &amp; Culture. That includes Whites, some Asians, some Hispanics and even a few conservative blacks. There are probably as many self-loathing white liberals in America as there are blacks &amp; Hispanics who long to destroy the greatness of Western Civilization. There is an old saying that goes &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Terrible story.</p>
<p>One good news contained here and other places - police officers, police departments are now operating under a policy that NW cop killers are to be tracked down and killed - all know the criminal justice system doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>For some reason, Blacks in America tend to get more upset if (White) police officers beat Black criminals with night sticks than if they simply shoot them dead.</p>

<p>Hispanics are not our friends.  But the average hispanic does not hate us they way blacks do.  The hispanic leadership is part of the anti White coalition, just as White feminazis, White gays, most White Judges and White environmentalists are.</p>
<p>But the average hispanic, even the hispanic leadership that appears in ADL/SPLC sponsored hate Whitey rally with  blacks doesn&rsquo;t like blacks.</p>
<p>Having been a prison guard, I can tell you that whenever there is a fight the hispanics always side with the Whites against the blacks.  The best thing about hispanics is that they are colonizing the black ghettos of the cities.</p>
<p>Black crime is moving to the suburbs and rural areas as a result of the hispanic takeover of city ghettos.  That is bad.  But it is good is that spreading the blacks out around the countryside breaks the power of the black reverends and poverty pimp leadership.  Their power base was always in the black churches in the ghettos.</p>
<p>The poverty pimps will never be able to re-build their power base with the scattered suburban and rural blacks.</p>

<p>There is probably much that we agree on. But consider this; suppose your children were at a public park and a group of 6 to 8 black thugs were about rob and assault them. Would you not want a group of young male Asians or Hispanics to intercede on behalf of your children and run the black thugs off? Whites are often the primary targets of blacks, but law abiding Asians &amp; Hispanics are frequently secondary targets. </p>
