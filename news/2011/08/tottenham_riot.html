	<p>Patrol cars, a double-decker bus and shops were set alight after a crowd of more than 300 people clashed with officers near Tottenham police station.</p>
<p>Missiles, including Molotov cocktails, fireworks, rocks and fire extinguishers, were thrown at the police. Scotland Yard said at least one of the officers had suffered head injuries.</p>
<p>Trouble flared after members of the community took to the streets on Saturday night to demand &#8220;justice&#8221;, after Mark Duggan, 29, was shot dead on Thursday.</p>
<p>After sections of Tottenham High Road were cleared of protesters, &#8220;pockets of trouble&#8221; continue to flare in nearby areas, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.</p>
<p>Two vans were reported to have been set ablaze in nearby Rheola Close, and Sky News said that its reporter and cameraman had to withdraw from the area over safety fears.</p>
<p>There were also reports of looting in Tottenham Hale Retail Park.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for London Ambulance Service said paramedics had treated 10 people, and nine were taken to hospital.</p>
<p>The violence erupted after around 120 people marched from the local Broadwater Farm area to Tottenham police station on Saturday, forcing officers to close the High Road and put traffic diversions in place.</p>
<p>After night fell, two police cars parked about 200 yards from the police station were set upon.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard said in a statement: &#8220;Two police cars had parked up at Forster Road/ High Road while their officers conducted traffic patrols on foot. This is about 200 yards north of Tottenham Police Station.</p>
<p>&#8220;At approximately 8.20pm a number of bottles were thrown at these two cars. One was set alight and the second was pushed into the middle of the High Road. It was subsequently set alight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The officers were not in the vehicles and were unhurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Officers from the Territorial Support Group have been deployed to disperse the crowd. They are deployed to the north and south of Tottenham Police Station in the High Road, and are subject to bottles and other missiles being thrown at them by the crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>A family friend of Mr Duggan, who gave her name only as Nikki, 53, said the man&rsquo;s friends and relatives had organised the protest because &#8220;something has to be done&#8221; and the marchers wanted &#8220;justice for the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of those involved lay in the road to make their point, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re making their presence known because people are not happy,&#8221; she added. &#8220;This guy was not violent. Yes, he was involved in things but he was not an aggressive person. He had never hurt anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the scenes of violence escalated, local MP David Lammy appealed for calm, saying in a statement that the events were &#8220;not representative of the vast majority of people in Tottenham&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Those who remember the destructive conflicts of the past will be determined not to go back to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We already have one grieving family in our community and further violence will not heal that pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;True justice can only follow a thorough investigation of the facts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tottenham community and Mark Duggan&rsquo;s family and friends need to understand what happened on Thursday evening when Mark lost his life. To understand those facts, we must have calm.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Mayor of London Boris Johnson urged those involved in the violence to &#8220;respect the rule of the law&#8221;, adding that &#8220;violence and destruction of property will do nothing to facilitate this investigation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commander Stephen Watson of the Metropolitan Police, which has set up a gold command room in Lambeth to oversee the incident, stressed that &#8220;a significant number of police officers&#8221; had been deployed to the scene, telling BBC News: &#8220;Our people are very well trained and led. We are exercising contingency plans which are well rehearsed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Our intention is to restore calm and normality to the area as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said there would be arrests for criminal offences, but that they came second to preserving public safety.</p>
<p>Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne, of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said in a statement: &#8220;I understand the distress that the shooting of Mark Duggan has caused to his family and in the community and that people need answers about what happened to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the IPCC yesterday supported 14 family members and friends in formally identifying Mr Duggan&rsquo;s body, and would have further meetings with his family today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still gathering evidence and will release further details about our progress with the investigation as soon as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Friday, it emerged that Mr Duggan had been travelling in a minicab and was gunned down after an apparent exchange of fire.</p>
<p>A police officer&rsquo;s radio was found to have a bullet lodged in it afterwards, suggesting they may have narrowly escaped being struck.</p>
<p>Officers had been attempting to carry out an arrest under the Trident operational command unit, which deals with gun crime in the black community, according to the IPCC.</p>
<p>The troubles evoked memories of 1985, when a police officer, Pc Keith Blakelock, was hacked to death following a riot in Broadwater Farm, where the marchers set off from on Saturday.</p>

						<p><small><em>The Sun (London), August 7, 2011</em></small></p>
<p><br>
Eight police officers were hospitalised following rioting in North London last night.</p>
<p>Cop cars were torched, shops looted and a bus burned out as hundreds rampaged through Tottenham.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard said at least one officer had received a head injury, but all were discharged this afternoon.</p>
<p>There were also fears dead bodies could be inside the wreckage of fire ravaged homes.</p>
<p>The violence followed local anger over the fatal shooting of a suspected gangster Mark Duggan by police.</p>
<p>Police said 26 cops had been injured and 55 people had so far been arrested.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the police version of events at Thursday&rsquo;s shooting of Duggan was challenged. They said he was shot after firing at a cop, who was saved by the bullet hitting his radio.</p>
<p>But tests on a bullet lodged in the radio are said to show it was police issue, not from the handgun Duggan was carrying.</p>
<p>In a separate incident tonight, youths vandalised a police car and smashed two windows on Enfield High Street in North London.</p>
<p>Groups of hooded teenagers, some numbering 30 or so, were running around the town centre, many with their faces covered and some carrying sticks and other weapons.</p>
<p>They were repeatedly chased away from shops by mounted police officers and dog handlers, although the troublemakers were said to have managed to break into a few stores.</p>
<p>Lines of riot police were readying themselves tonight in Enfield in case the trouble escalates.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard said it had an operation in place across the capital tonight, with &#8220;high visibility&#8221; patrols being carried out.</p>
<p>Additional officers will be stationed in Tottenham throughout the night.</p>
<p>An initially-peaceful demonstration had been held outside a police station on the area&rsquo;s High Road from about 5pm last night, where locals called for &#8220;justice&#8221; after 29-year-old Mark Duggan was killed on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Police had stopped a taxi he was travelling in, but the situation exploded when he was said to have shot at an officer  &mdash;  prompting them to fatally gun him down.</p>
<p>Anger over his death turned to violence yesterday as hundreds more protesters appeared on the scene  &mdash;  apparently alerted by people using Twitter.</p>
<p>Late this afternoon Mr Duggan&rsquo;s family called for an end to the rioting, saying any violence was not in his name.</p>
<p>His older brother Shaun Hall said the idea he had shot at a cop was &#8220;rubbish&#8221;.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;My brother&rsquo;s not that kind of person, he&rsquo;s not stupid.</p>
<p>&#8220;To shoot after the police, that&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re all devastated to hear about the mishap, we don&rsquo;t actually know what has happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the worst thing at the moment is that nobody has actually come forward and said this is what has taken place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether we believe what they&rsquo;re saying or whether we don&rsquo;t, there should be somebody here putting my parents&rsquo; mind at rest about what is actually going on.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole family&rsquo;s devastated. We don&rsquo;t want Mark portrayed as some kind of gangster.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a family man as you see from the true pictures that you see of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know people are frustrated, they are angry out there at the moment, but I please try hold it down.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not condoning any kind of actions like that at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&rsquo;t make this about my brother&rsquo;s life  &mdash;  my brother is a good man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cops, who had apparently been expecting trouble, responded to last night&rsquo;s violence with hundreds of heavily-protected riot officers as well as mounted police while fire crews struggled to get near the blazes.</p>
<p>It is not believed that any officers were inside the police cars when they were attacked and set on fire.</p>
<p>Looters hurried away from wrecked stores in nearby Tottenham Hale Retail Park with trolleys loaded with stolen goods.</p>
<p>Today Stafford Scott, described as a leading member of the community, said the initial protest was sparked because people thought police had not thought about Mr Duggan&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Up until now they hadn&rsquo;t come to help and advise them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were absolutely disgusted by that so we decided we needed to go to Tottenham Police Station.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted someone senior from the police service to come and explain to us what was happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eventually they sent for a superintendent but by then it was too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am telling you, had they dealt with us early in the day we would have removed ourselves from this area.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those people that tell you it is not the same as 1985 were not here in 1985  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s exactly the same as 1985.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Scott also made claims about Mr Duggan&rsquo;s gun at odds with the currently accepted version of events.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We don&rsquo;t believe that Mark was bad enough or mad enough to come out of a car and want to shoot at armed police officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our information is telling us that the gun that was found there was actually found in a sock, meaning that it wasn&rsquo;t prepared for action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking earlier today Commander Adrian Hanstock said the disorder had been completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The behaviour by a criminal minority put police officers, fire brigade personnel and the public at significant risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The death of Mr Duggan is extremely regrettable and will be the subject of an independent investigation by the IPCC.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is absolutely tragic that someone has died, but that does not give a criminal minority the right to destroy businesses and people&rsquo;s livelihoods and steal from their local community.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no indication that the protest would deteriorate into the levels of criminal and violent disorder that we saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that certain elements, who were not involved with the vigil, took the opportunity to commit disorder and physically attack police officers, verbally abuse fire brigade personnel and destroy vehicles and buildings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our officers were subjected to bottles, petrol bombs and other missiles being thrown at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have recovered excellent CCTV and those who committed disorder and criminal acts will be identified and held account for their actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Live TV pictures from last night showed a double-decker bus first emitting clouds of smoke where Tottenham High Road meets Brook St. It then burst into flames which quickly gutted the vehicle, as its fuel tanks exploded.</p>
<p>The trouble erupted near the Broadwater Farm estate where PC Keith Blakelock was hacked to death by rioters in October 1985.</p>
<p>Labour MP David Lammy said: &#8220;What happened here raised huge questions and we need answers, but the response to that is not to loot, to rob.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are homeless people standing back there. We don&rsquo;t know if there are fatalities within some of those homes and flats which are now burned out.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a large crowd was on the streets last night but not all the onlookers were involved in the disorder.</p>
<p>The spokesman added: &#8220;A number of bottles were thrown at two police cars  &mdash;  one was set alight and the second was pushed into the middle of the High Road. It was subsequently set alight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local resident Maria Robinson told the BBC the situation was &#8220;absolutely manic&#8221;. She said some rioters were &#8220;making bottle bombs&#8221; and starting fires.</p>
<p>Another resident, David Akinsanya, 46, said shop windows were smashed. He said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s really bad. I&rsquo;m feeling unsafe. It looks like it&rsquo;s going to get very tasty. I saw a guy getting attacked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;There was a line of about 15 riot police in front of the police station on the north side and then there were loads of uniformed officers on the south side of the police station.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&rsquo;t making any effort to go into the crowd. Every now and again they would rush the crowd and the crowd would run.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stuart Radose had to flee his flat above a Carpetright shop last night as a fire ravaged the building.</p>
<p>Describing the scenes, he said: &#8220;We live on the top floor. We could see the rioters coming closer. Aldi was on fire and barricades were being made by rioters. It was really scary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Radose, who went to stay at his father&rsquo;s house ten minutes away, added: &#8220;We&rsquo;ve gone back this morning and it&rsquo;s a complete shell. Everything we had is gone. It&rsquo;s just mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;So many people have lost everything. It&rsquo;s just crazy. It looks like its the the Second World War. It looks like the Blitz where we were living.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Radose said he his wife had thought the situation was beginning to calm down at about midnight, but he then saw from his balcony that &#8220;things were getting worse and worse&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;There didn&rsquo;t seem to be a police presence at all. Buildings seemed to be allowed to burn. I guess they couldn&rsquo;t get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I think we&rsquo;ve probably spent our last night Tottenham. We&rsquo;re just in shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman said paramedics had treated a total of 11 people, ten of whom were taken to hospital.</p>
<p>Two of the injured police officers needed attention from ambulance crews, but it is not yet clear whether the others were dealt with by the ambulance service.</p>
<p>The London Fire Brigade said today: &#8220;At the moment all the fires are under control. We are still at the scene of some of them to damp them down and make sure everything is out.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for 10 Downing Street said: &#8220;The rioting in Tottenham last night was utterly unacceptable.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no justification for the aggression the police and the public faced, or for the damage to property.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is now a police investigation into the rioting and we should let that process happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Home Secretary Theresa May also blasted the violence, saying: &#8220;I condemn utterly the violence in Tottenham last night. Such disregard for public safety and property will not be tolerated, and the Metropolitan Police have my full support in restoring order.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to pay tribute to the officers who put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m appalled at the scenes of violence and destruction in Tottenham.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Acting Commissioner has assured me that the police are doing everything they can to resolve this situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events leading to these disturbances are rightly being investigated by the IPCC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harming people and property will do nothing to facilitate the investigation, it will only make the situation worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor for policing in London Kit Malthouse this morning said officers had coped well with the riot.</p>
<p>But he admitted no-one predicted the level of violence, arson and looting that was going to take place.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Nobody thought that the protest would necessarily degenerate into that kind of activity and there&rsquo;s no reason why they should have done.</p>
<p>&#8220;The critical thing is, were we able to mobilise forces fast enough to deal with what did arise?</p>
<p>&#8220;We did get a significant number of officers out there to deal with it in good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission is probing the shooting of Mr Duggan. Police say a handgun was found at the scene and a bullet was later found stuck in an officer&rsquo;s radio.<br>

		<p>First, it is good to note that the digital divide has been narrowed, and apparently not only in the United States. </p>
<p>We are taught that one reason children of color have struggled in schools up to this point is that they have been denied access to personal computers and social networking sites. This has clearly changed. So when the smoke clears from London after a third round of fires, or however many subsequent rounds of fires that it might take, money being no object, we can look forward to improved math scores from the children of those communities constituting the most vulnerable among us.</p>
<p>And then this next round of Olympics will be gloriously diverse, and a sight to behold from a great distance.</p>

		<p>As if anyone could have thought blacks would engage in this sort of behavior in the Western world outside the U.S.  Positively amazing.</p>
<p>As an aside, Tottenham is the section of North London from which one my fave bands of the Sixties, the Dave Clark Five, hailed.  Their music, in fact, was known throughout England as the &#8220;Tottenham sound.&#8221;  From &#8220;Glad All Over&#8221; to this   &mdash;   another reminder of why this green and pleasant land is on the road to oblivion.  The Monarchy, as usual, is silent.  </p>

		<p>From the Deputy Mayor: &#8220;But he admitted no-one predicted the level of violence, arson and looting that was going to take place.&#8221;: Yes. It has been predicted, but he and others like him just can&rsquo;t believe they could be so wrong. I wonder just how many Britons think things will ever get better? What, maybe once they import enough Sub-Saharan Africans to intermix with all the Whites, then maybe?  Or maybe once the minorities become the majority and the Whites are cowed into submission while being exterminated over time as in South Africa?  The British will either turn to the BNP or they will turn to dust.  It is their choice.</p>

		<p>Always the same story - whatever country you are in! The poor, innocent, benevolent if &#8220;troubled&#8221; Black somehow, yes SOMEHOW manages to find himself in the gunsights of police officers, despite being a veritable pillar of the community would never harm another human being. Strangely, this almost NEVER seems to happen to other peoples - one rarely sees this scenario involving anyone BUT Blacks - even if the cops are Black as well!! Why is that exactly? How do these perfectly innocent Blacks manage to somehow be in a position to even be draw-upon, let alone shot by police with such frequency?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s THEM do you? Could it be the way THEY behave, the way THEY conduct themselves in a civilized society?</p>
<p>No, it couldn&rsquo;t be that, could it? It&rsquo;s just can&rsquo;t be&hellip;for that would be &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Only one action will stop rampaging blacks, and that is brute force.  Whites have understood this for centuries, but they stopped applying it in the 60&rsquo;s.  Now the Western world is being subjected to an onslaught that it&rsquo;s unwilling to contain.  <br>
How much longer will authorities allow this to continue and, no doubt, worsen?  When wealthy celebs are attacked in their homes?  When the halls of Congress are invaded by black mobs?  <br>
One simple action is necessary  &mdash;  fire live rounds at the rampagers.  They will disperse, and after another couple of such incidents, the ghetto will be as quiet as it was under Jim Crow.<br>
It&rsquo;s unlikely, of course, that this will happen.  The police and national guard will work piecemeal to contain the violence.  Confrontations between blacks and whites will become more numerous, and civil order will gradually break down.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s very frightening what&rsquo;s happening with the London riots but the harsh truth is we may look back on these days with some nostalgia as things get worse. Right now it seems to be just kids out there &#8216;protesting&rsquo; but as the political and police responses become increasingly hysterical and overbearing - special powers aren&rsquo;t needed, just maintain the already present laws - you&rsquo;ll soon have Mr &amp; Mrs Middle Class out there in the streets looting and burning. Who will the authorities have to blame? No-one but themselves. </p>

London is ruined, England, near extinction as anything but a sink hole of humanity.

		<p>Britain, France and Germany heavily criticized the US over Katrina with the photo of a big fat lady on the cover of one of their magazines, standing knee deep in water with an anguished look on her face, as if she had endured months of neglect and oppression.  Of course, that&rsquo;s what the European socialists wanted the world to think.  </p>
<p>Now, as luck would have it, they&rsquo;re going into what looks to be a long period of civil disobedience from blacks and Muslims.  Remember the Muslims who protested in Britain the day British military dead were honored, and the Muslims carried signs saying they got what they deserved for killing Muslims?  Well, that will only get worse, right along with rioting against austerity measures, because all of Europe is coming apart financially.</p>
<p>When the freebies stop for lack of funds, both the blacks and Muslims will be rioting all across Europe, just as they are now doing in London.</p>
<p>I wonder if they&rsquo;re glad now they opted for diversity to make them stronger.</p>
<p>And I wonder if they think all their nutty social engineering laws designed to keep whites in their place might have been better directed at the third world perps to keep them in line.</p>
<p>As the economy continues its downward spiral, so too will the social fabric go right along with it, and eventually many parts of Europe will closely resemble Bagdad.  It couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch of leftist nut cases.<br>

		<p>Well, the big, black, lie becomes less tenable every year.  What?  Four, five decades of stupid, pathetic white self flagellation and handouts now?  And yet year after year the same old story.  Blacks given jobs they can&rsquo;t get on their own merits, tossed increasingly worthless pieces of paper disguised as degrees, fed, housed, allowed to emigrate from their backwards hellholes and given the opportunity to live in a civilized society, put up with&hellip;</p>
<p>Warning.  The white worm is about to turn, and none too soon.  The big, black lie is untenable.  The cost is white bloodshed, humiliation, and extinction.</p>
<p>Kudos to you, Jared Taylor, for your erudite civility, ceaseless dedication to calmly telling and fostering the truth, but the truth is this&hellip;</p>
<p>In this, the second great worldwide depression, whites are beginning to wake up only to realize they are living in a nightmarish reality foisted upon them largely by their own utopian stupidity.  They face death and destruction as a direct result of their own high minded tolerance and noble foolishness.</p>
<p>And they are beginning to get furious.  </p>
<p>Good.  Its long past time.  Don&rsquo;t count the white race out just yet.  Things will and must get ugly before they will get better.  Give this evil stupidity a little more time to sink in and consider protecting yourself, because apparently the suicidally liberalized police can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The British cops should be using live ammunition, and if they don&rsquo;t have the will to, the military should be called in and take over.  And if the military, shackled by suicidally sick leftist multiculturalist traitors and cowards, won&rsquo;t do what need be done, the white British population needs to arm itself and take the initiative.</p>
<p>Because this isn&rsquo;t a series of riots - its the beginning of an all out race war.</p>

		<p>Look at the Daily Mail, it&rsquo;s done extensive coverage from the very beginning showing exactly who is doing it but every so often you are unable to access the comments section, then when you are able to  access them there seems to be no mention of &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; immigration or &#8216;young black&rsquo;( or anything to  define what it is or who  is doing it). It is like they&rsquo;re now filtering out these words.  Plenty of talking from black leaders though like Lee Jasper and white leftwing apologists for their savagery. We need marital law in these areas and for a curfew put on all blacks after six PM. Then set up special courts to make an example of them. Recently they put a a number of  white middleclass students away merely for high jinks and where nothing was stolen or looted and the only charge  showing disrespect to the police by throwing plastic bottles at them.  What will these blacks thugs get if caught. Truth is  even without hoodies and scarves CCTVT is useless for  identifying young  blacks  when in crowds and we all know it. Racism doesnt even come into it.</p>

		<p>What we are seeing is a world wide war on the white race.  It is taking place on several fronts.  Economics are being used to destroy the stable white middle class of Europe, the US, Canada and Austalia.  Racial violence is another front where non whites seem to be free to attack whites at will.  immigration of foreign peoples is an attempt to breed out the white race once and for all and with it the biggest civilizing influence of history.  A dark age of ignorance, reverse racism and social destruction is rapidly spread over the world.  The speed of this plague is picking up as the white race sits and stares immobilized with indecision depending on the fools who started this to solve the problem  In the US Erick Holder has openly said he will not investigate hate crimes by &#8220;his people&#8221;  the white citizens of the US accepted this shocking admission of racial prejudice without a single protest by any organized group.  A people that will not fight for its survival will fall.</p>

		<p>&gt;&ldquo;But he admitted no-one predicted the level of violence, arson and looting that was going to take place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Enoch Powell (16 June 1912 - 8 February 1998), English politician who served as a Conservative Party MP from 1950–1974, sure saw it coming.  From his &#8220;Rivers of Blood Speech&#8221; (1968):</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependants, who are for the most part the material of the future growth of the immigrant descended population. It is like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre. So insane are we that we actually permit unmarried persons to immigrate for the purpose of founding a family with spouses and fiancées whom they have never seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And further:</p>
<p>&#8220;As I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding. Like the Roman, I seem to see &#8216;the River Tiber foaming with much blood.&rsquo; That tragic and intractable phenomenon which we watch with horror on the other side of the Atlantic but which there is interwoven with the history and existence of the States itself, is coming upon us here by our own volition and our own neglect. Indeed, it has all but come. In numerical terms, it will be of American proportions long before the end of the century. Only resolute and urgent action will avert it even now. Whether there will be the public will to demand and obtain that action, I do not know. All I know is that to see, and not to speak, would be the great betrayal.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What will put a stop to these riots are rioters getting literally ripped apart by hails of bullets, grenades and other weapons. Then the wounded that are still alive being finished off with gunshots to the head, fired by heavily armed and armored soldiers and police sent to crush these insurrections and uprisings. That is what these riots really are, insurrections. This is more than a police problem, this is a run up to a civil war not only in England but in every western nation which has a large population of violent, third world non-whites. Otherwise these insurrectionists are only going to get bolder, well armed and begin murdering and raping native citizens wholesale like the people they really are.</p>

		<p>Of course this riot has nothing to do with a socio-political statement or an injustice protest.  It is simply the african criminal opportunist, mayhem and chaos loving mentality seizing an excuse to do what is genetically intrinsic.  If you don&rsquo;t give them what they think they are entitled to (which is everything for nothing)and they haven&rsquo;t earned they resort to their most defining attribute, violent criminality.  As long as the white ruling class continue to foolishly perpetuate the equality fantasy and attempt to placate and pacify the africans this will be the result.  The reality is they will never be satisfied and all attempts to do so will only enable and embolden them.  All concessions will only be perceived as weakness and lead to more unreasonable demands.  Such is the opportunistic, animal-like nature of the african.  </p>

		<p>OK, I was thinking here. Blacks have 40%! Yes 40% of all state-Federal jobs in the USA..and this is why the government is not effective..And all over the West they get jobs via affirmative action. Now with the riots&hellip;etc..and the imagine blacks are giving..When AA falls by the way..latter this decade. I expect blacks to be in the highest category of welfare bums and unemployed. No one will hire them, except dumb liberals. This will add to the violence of blacks everywhere. But on the 2nd phase of post peak oil the fall of society..They will have zero money, and zero to offer.</p>
<p>When the great famine hits the West this will play to their disadvantage. I have read about many famines in the past..from the Russian famine of the 1920s to the holodomor. Even about the Warsaw ghetto famines. One thing in common is wealth. The wealthy lived the poor starved. Take the Warsaw Ghetto for example the Jews had about 1 million Jews in the Ghetto..about 1/3rd were well off, 1/3rd medium class, and 1/3rd poor.. At the hey day of food shortage the poor were dieing..the poor Jews who lived worked in the ghetto just for basic foods. The Germans allocated 150g a day bread to the Jews there each man.That&rsquo;s about one slice of thin bread. During the UA Holodomor, the Ukraine people who ate were the ones who worked at the collective farms. They had work and ate. Now these were state induced famines..lets look at a real non state induced famine..Lets look at Scandinavia late 1700s. About 20% of the population died. Again who died? The bottom class or the poor unemployed.</p>
<p>Look at Africa now, even with massive food aid and help&hellip;who is dieing the bottom class.</p>
<p>So when the great famine comes &#8220;I predict 2020-2030 decade&#8221; the blacks will as a race in the west by this time have no welfare, no SSI, no savings &#8220;blacks dont save&rsquo; and NO ONE will hire them! They will be the poorest class.<br>
Now just do your math on how this will play out by historic facts on famines. </p>

Even if this person was White (doubtful), 99 percent of these rioters are non-Whites based on video I&rsquo;ve seen.

These rampages are not &#8220;just kids out there protesting&#8221;.  This is the same thing that always happens in black communities when law and order break down.  It occurred after the South lost control of freed slaves, after civil rights were granted, and after Katrina.  Blacks run rampant, looting and burning.  If whites aren&rsquo;t able (or refuse) to immediately respond with force, blacks move into white areas and prey on the residents there.  The reports of whites being robbed of the clothes on their backs reminds me of the public stripping of whites that followed black uprisings in Kenya.  Now, these actions are filmed by the looters, to be repeatedly celebrated.  </p>

Great Britain never had widespread slavery based on race or the legacy of &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; discrimination that we had in the United States. Now by importing the same people of color, they have the same problems. Are we doomed to never learn from the past?</p>

		<p>&gt;What will put a stop to these riots are rioters getting literally ripped apart by hails of bullets, grenades and other weapons. That is what these riots really are, insurrections. This is more than a police problem, this is a run up to a civil war not only in England but in every western nation which has a large population of violent, third world non-whites.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Periapsis  </p>
<p>This is a great comment!!</p>
<p>You nailed it exactly right: There are more than riots, they are insurrections.  They are an extension of the Greek riots from last year and are spreading worldwide with no end in sight.  The elite are losing control of the masses as  economies are beginning to collapse, as socialism fails.  I expect soon to see an increase in more powerful weaponry among the rioters; this will spread here to the US.</p>
<p>England is a police state.  The elites in control have done their level best to disarm and emasculate the native population and flood their homeland with hostile non-Whites from the Third World.</p>
<p>O, how far the land of the Magna Carta, Rule of Law, the Industrial Revolution, the land of  Locke, Hume, Mill and Hayek has fallen!  The people who generated the profound LIBERAL idea that everyone has an equal right to life, liberty and property now live in a police state.</p>
<p>Since &#8220;New Labor&#8221; won the election in 1997, England has undergone a revolution brought about by the new government and media and beholden to the odious, bureaucratic -driven European Union:</p>
<p><i>Since 1997, England has had a bewildering 4,000 new criminal offences created &mdash; many dealing with censorship of speech and publication. They are usually enforced by a summary &mdash; and often arbitrary and even corrupt &mdash; process.</i></p>
<p>The English have been disarmed, rendering them unable to defend themselves with deadly force as immigrant crime, violence and rioting is increasing. </p>
<p>Jerks like former PM Brown urged the population to reject the notion of self-defense, even promoting the confiscation of knives! </p>
<p><i>Young people are thinking it&rsquo;s acceptable, fashionable, necessary for them to protect themselves, to carry a knife.. carrying a knife puts people at greater danger of violence than not carrying one. Just like we made guns unacceptable, we should make knives unacceptable.</i></p>
<p><i>In America it is acceptable for many people to carry guns, it&rsquo;s not in Britain. We&rsquo;ve got to make it as unacceptable to carry knives. Most decent people would want to do that and I think what you will see.. led not just by government but people in the country is, &#8216;get knives off our streets.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Wonder what the pensioners must be thinking, those who lost loved ones in WW II or risked their lives to defend England?:</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;Our country has been given away to foreigners while we, the generation who fought for freedom, are having to sell our homes for care and are being refused medical services because incomers come first.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Current PM David Cameron&rsquo;s suggestion?  Hug a hoodie!!</p>
<p>Beneath contempt! </p>
<p>I wonder if it is too late for England?  Will anyone there remember the Dave Clark Five?  Will anyone in the future be <i>allowed</i> to listen to the Dave Clark Five?</p>
<p>Those who did this to England and the Native Born White Population should be met with pitchforks and torches and hanged from lampposts!</p>

		<p>Just saw on Drudge where the police have lost control of the streets,and that the rioters are now spreading into middle class neighborhoods.  Since the Brits have voluntarily disarmed themselves, and with the police unable to control the situation, whites are in danger. </p>
<p>British PC politicians are far too cowardly to call in what is left of their army to stop the situation.  You see, it is much better in the eyes of these gutless &#8220;leaders&#8221; for white Brits to be killed and burned out than to shoot a noble &#8220;yooooth&#8221;. That would be sooo raycist.   </p>
<p>The situation currently developing in Britain should illustrate to the dumbest leftist American the value of the second amendment.  Even in mild mannered white bread America, blacks know that there will come a point of no return when the white population will begin shooting back.  </p>
<p>Where I live, many whites are begging for the same situation that is occurring in Britain to happen here. They  have taken crap from blacks and their enablers for so many years, the boiling point is near. </p>
<p>A few years ago in my county, blacks burned the center of a major village.  They torched police cars, attacked police, and burned several businesses.  During this mess, you could almost hear gun cabinets open and the oiling up and working of rifle bolts. I&rsquo;m sure that blacks heard it also. </p>

		<p>Agree with 28, that the point of no return has been passed and we are now looking at a small war. The &#8220;chattering  classes&#8221; ( love that Britishism describing airheaded liberal commentary ) are several days behind the gathering momentum of both the leaders of the insurrection and the military authorities; probably what is in our country the CIA/FBI complex has already been in conference about how to kill off the snake. The leaders of the insurrection are also probably talking about how to lay low and regroup. The rioters are being led by Marxist/Anarchist/Black Power agitators. British authorities should deploy something like Blackwater ( if they have it) and simply start killing priority targets.</p>

		<p>Also agree with 43, Bon.<br>
England has been a police state frequently in its history; for example, Elizabethan England was one,long internal war because of  Catholic / Protestant conflict.<br>
 England used it DORA act to inititiate police state policies during the twentieth century and it may well again. I think though the dirty work, if it were to be done, will be done by mercs, as it is here.<br>
But maybe not. I can unfortunately see something approaching a dead ended capitulation, paralysis plus eternal dithering. The insurrectionists have a mass following that is too large to be dispelled without a Franco style counter-move, and England has pretty effectively crushed such sentiment. <br>
Does anyone notice how the statements of the so-called leaders reflect a small shopkeeper mentality? It could be that I am misreading all of this, and that it is not such a big deal after all. A few nights of looting, a few years of committees, armies of social workers dispatched to find out &#8220;answers&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I live in London and have seen first hand, some of the damage that has been wrought by this youthful hi-jinks.</p>
<p>I had to leave work early due to the disruptions by the &#8216;disaffected, disadvantaged and socially isolated urban youth&rsquo;.  Getting back home, I noted that all the supermarkets and bars were shut down for fear of the contagion spreading. Believe me, after 10 years in this area, I can assure you that the contagion has been spreading for almost as long as I have been here. Unpleasant cesspits like Norwood Junction and Thornton Heath are even wrose and decidedly menacing.</p>
<p>The looters are predominantly black, but we cannot deny that (an admittedly low-level of white trash), have been copying their role models in the ghetto community. To do so would be to play into the hands of the print and broadcast media who by and large vet every single photograph or video frame to maximise the numbers of white underclass yobs they can portray. Having said all that, I cannot help but believe that without the initiative being taken by predominantly black looters in London, the corpulent, slug-like white underclass would have stuck to their drugs and alcohol and been only a nuisance to themselves.</p>
<p>The gutless press and broadcast media have barely been able to mention the racial angle in all this; the euphemism of &#8216;youth&rsquo; is generally employed, as socialists generally prefer to manufacture and exploit a schism between younger people and older people.  Added to this, a great  number of the looters are hardly &#8216;youth&rsquo; by anyone&rsquo;s reckoning; they are in their 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s and sometimes even older.</p>
<p>The media participation in all this is the endless reformulation of sociological &#8216;justifications&rsquo; for this large-scale armed robbery. It is only the Daily Mail that mentioned bystanders being mugged and the likely targeting of White people by the black hooligans. The &#8216;quality&rsquo; broadsheets were handwringing about the aforementioned sociological rationalisations for a shortcut to new iPhones and flat-screen television sets.</p>
<p>The alleged catalyst for all this - the killing of a thug who was brandishing a gun at police officers - hardly seems to stand up as yesterday at Hackney, the police conducted a &#8216;stop and search&rsquo; operation which subsequently used as justification for another night of violence stretching from Zone 2 London  to Bromley, Croydon, Enfield, Ealing (Zones 4 &amp; 5 and, Birmingham, Bristol and Nottingham (entirely separate cities).</p>
<p>The police have been diffident in their response to the disorder and even now, I doubt very much if they will actually step up to the plate and do what really needs doing.</p>
<p>There is much claimed for multi-culturalism by the liberal apologists for this travesty of social engineering, but if it is not possible for the ethnics to be effectively policed by people outside their own race, then doesn&rsquo;t that lend the lie to all this liberal claptrap?</p>

		<p>Ok, just for the sake of argument (which is absolute nonsense; but let&rsquo;s just give them - one more time - this freebie), say the police DID unfairly (I know, but stay with me a sec) shoot the black man sitting in the car. Is the answer to one unfair  (which we know it&rsquo;s not) shooting by authorities cause for mass insurrection, rioting, senseless destruction and killing? Really? That&rsquo;s the way logical (choke!) people should react? That&rsquo;s the way reasonable, civilized people should respond to one event?</p>
<p>For the life of me I can&rsquo;t recall an incident which unfairly caused death or injury to a white person (of which take place on a regular basis) that has resulted in white rioting, killing, looting and destruction of innocent people&rsquo;s businesses and property as a response.</p>
<p>The initial incident isn&rsquo;t the problem; the REACTION to it is the problem. And that violent, animalistic reaction to virtually everything is the difference between whites and blacks. In their savage, twisted minds the tiniest thing can be absolute justification for war. As long as they are living among whites, they will bring us war.</p>

Here in Stockholm @ 8PM, there are already reports of new rioting starting up  tonight, in half a dozen British cities   &mdash;   the fourth night in a row. (I wonder if/when it will spread to Europe?)  However, the weather report predicts rain and cold moving in on the British Isles.  That may dampen it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Swedish TV and they are saying that 16,000 police have been deployed in London and that THIS  TIME the police are going to get tough and will have zero tolerance for riotous behaviour  (acknowledging that they were too weak previously).  I had been unaware of any such  news until this morning, when I saw the front-page headlines of the Swedish papers proclaining  &#8220;Chaos reigns in London&#8221;,  and  &#8220;London out of control&#8221;.  That was complete news to me.</p>
<p>Well,  it was coming. Enoch Powell predicted it, and  any Amren reader would have known the same.</p>
<p>I turned on the TV and saw a  financial report about panic in the Asian markets and that Wall Street has fallen 20% in the last 2 weeks. Also, S&P; has downgraded US securities. Oh boy!</p>
<p>According to Huffington Post, the rioting of these  (ahem)  &#8220;young people&#8221;   in England is due to the desperate financial situation  of the government and to  severe cut-backs in social services and welfare   &mdash;    $130 BILLION of cuts!!!  (But not a word about race.)</p>
<p>Just wait til they cut the  welfare in the US!  There will be millions of  &#8220;Young People&#8221; rioting all across America.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just been watching  the Swedish and CNN news reports.  Very interesting (how little they tell you!, and how they manage to tell you the news while NOT telling you the news). </p>
<p>They showed film of  &#8220;Young People&#8221; in London  being stopped and frisked    &mdash;   ALL white.  They showed scenes of crowds in the streets and  milling behind police barriers   &mdash;    ALL white, taken  in obviously white areas!  There seemed to be NOTHING filmed in Brixton or Tottenham or Notting Hill  or the other  black/West Indian areas&hellip;. not a black face in sight.</p>
<p>Then CNN did show a scene of  &#8220;a kid&#8221;   [that&rsquo;s a quote!] being stopped and questioned, then struggling and being subdued by the police (quite violently).  It was filmed from a distance, across the street, and his face was almost always kept obscured, but occasionally you could get a glimpse that he was black (and no Briton).  This &#8220;kid&#8221; looked to be about 30, and the general impression was of the  brutality of the police.  After all, whatever had  this poor deprived  &#8220;kid&#8221; done that it took a dozen cops to violently subdue and arrest him?</p>
<p>NOWHERE, in any of the reporting, is there any mention of race;  and you would get the impression that it is all  being done by violent, desperate, white  &#8220;Young People&#8221; who are burning England down.</p>
<p>Btw, as a follow-up  to this reporting, just to  make sure that no one might get any  strange  or original ideas about this  &#8220;mindless rioting&#8221; of  &#8220;idle young people&#8221;  who have been  &#8220;deprived of opportunity&#8221;  and who &#8220;have no future&#8221;,  CNN followed  it up with a program about  a Nazi massacre in Italy.  That should keep the masses in line and suitably scared about the jackboots who  are coming to get you, if you don&rsquo;t watch out.</p>

<p> &#8220;I don&rsquo;t call it rioting. I call it an insurrection of the masses of the people. It is happening in Syria, it is happening in Clapham.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Greetings from London. And if you&rsquo;d like a report from the ground - not from the left-liberal BBC - yes, the rioters and looters are about 90% black, I estimate. Some Asians have joined them - although a lot of Asians, e.g. Turks in North London, and Sikhs in Southall, South West London - promptly armed themselves and defended their own territory against the looters. Most Asians have a pretty low view of black Africans. Ah, the joys of multi-culturalism! Left-wing politicians have blamed the rioting on our very necessary government cutbacks. It is social deprivation, you know, that is making these poor, suffering people go out at night, set fire to cars and steal plasma screen TVs. Hilarious. <br>
The poorest borough of all, Tower Hamlets, in East London - one of the poorest boroughs in Europe, depending on how you read the statistics - has seen no rioting at all. Why not? Because it&rsquo;s very traditional Asian, mostly Bangladeshi, and Muslim conservative, with strong families (and honour killings, of course), no alcohol, strict discipline and so on. Complicated though, isn&rsquo;t it? Muslims may cause other problems, but they tend not to loot, or take grinning delight in total social breakdown and chaos, like certain other racial groups we could mention &hellip;<br>

		<p><i>What we are seeing is a world wide war on the white race. It is taking place on several fronts. Economics are being used to destroy the stable white middle class of Europe, the US, Canada and Australia.</i></p>
<p>Same old story. Elites use the underclass as muscle against the middle. Then they proceed to loot their own countries. <br>
 </p>
<p><i>the euphemism of &lsquo;youth&rsquo; is generally employed, as socialists generally prefer to manufacture and exploit a schism between younger people and older people. Added to this, a great number of the looters are hardly &lsquo;youth&rsquo; by anyone&rsquo;s reckoning; they are in their 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s and sometimes even older.</i></p>
<p>Interesting point. One wonders if the tendency to use the word &#8220;youth&#8221; comes from over the hill 1960s leftists who want to spark a new Age of Aquarius? Or more cynically, want to play off young against old in a replay of their own glory days? Or maybe to minimize what they realize deep down to be a potential insurgent situation in their own cities?</p>

<p>No doubt!</p>

		<p>What plagues me is that the wastage wrought on GB because of WW1 and 2 is showing. The backbone which is missing, as one poster above stated, could be found as skeletal remains at Verdun, the Somme, North Africa, or any of a hundred other battlefields.<br>
The current handwringing about the rightness or wrongness of curtailing rioters with force seems to me caused by the collective loss of pride aggravated by Marxist sympathies for the accursed underdog -  forever beatified by them. Whatever good came out of the lower classes historically came from militant nationalism. Internationalist poison has killed that movement off, and we are left with aimless frightened dregs. What is terrible and comical is how causeless these people are. They are rioting and looting for free electronic trash.<br>
Or something. </p>

		<p>@ No 65 Shawn (the female)</p>
<p>So far in South Africa since majority black rule and &#8220;freedom&#8221; in 1994, about 40,000 white people have been randomly slain by blacks through &#8220;crime&#8221;</p>
<p>Within that figure are nearly 4,000 white mainly Afrikaner farmers who have been brutally murdered.</p>
<p>So far whites have responded by using the instruments of state and following the rule of law. About 1 in 10 murders results in prosecution</p>
<p>Is this tolerance and civilised behaviour of plain stupidity?<br>
has the time come for vigilante groups and kangaroo courts?</p>
