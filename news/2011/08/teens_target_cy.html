<h1>Teens Target Cyclists in &#8216;Knockout&rsquo; Game</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS (St. Louis), August 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>There&rsquo;s an alert out about recent assaults on bike riders in south St. Louis.</p>
<p>Trailnet.org, an organization that promotes hiking and biking, is cautioning riders to be on the alert for roving bands of teenagers who swarm and attack riders.</p>
<p>Trailnet says the latest attack was last Thursday (8/25) afternoon near Missouri Botanical Garden where a group of 10 to 15 African-American teens charged and attacked a cyclist.</p>
<p>&#8220;They weren&rsquo;t really interested in robbing me. It just seemed like they wanted to beat me up,&#8221; says assault victim Cheech Ramirez. &#8220;They weren&rsquo;t interested in letting me get off the ground and having a fair fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ramirez says he and his friends returned to the scene minutes later to help another bicyclist who was being beaten.</p>
<p>Police say there have been other, similar attacks in the city, and they believe all the victims are picked at random.</p>

		<p>It was only a matter of time before something like this happened in this particular St. Louis neighborhood.  It is anchored by the city&rsquo;s botanical gardens, but it long ago went black.  In the gentrification craze of the last decade, it was probably the only city area that had gone heavily black that the white yuppies tried to turn back, mostly to no avail.  (Most of the gentrification took place in neighborhoods that had not yet turned black.)  But there are now more whites there as of 2010 compared to 2000, so this only created more targets to the neighborhood&rsquo;s usual thug population.</p>

		<p>Trailnet.org is &#8220;warning&#8221; riders to beware. Needless to say, they do not mention the word &#8220;Black&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, all of us here already feel generally the same way about this one. So why don&rsquo;t we all go to their website and post some polite but firmly informative comments for them?</p>
<p>ONE new convert to right thinking is worth 10,000 comments in an echo chamber. Let&rsquo;s see some activism here people!</p>

		<p>All the pretty banners, and a few nicer places to eat cannot reverse the demographic changes of &#8220;The Grove&#8221;. There are still quite a few White people there, plus a fair collection of Italian holdouts that try to imagine they can bar the gates a little while longer, but while the botanical garden is nice, and Tower Grove Park is pretty   &mdash;   most of the streets around it are scary as all hell at night. Arsenal on both sides of it is not exactly a friendly walk; even 10 years ago I used to have to walk that area in groups, and usually armed with something obvious to avoid problems. Flad is very scary at night, and not a place you would want to make a wrong turn into. There are still some nice houses in the area on Hartford, Magnolia, and if you got a little further up on Utah. The city has tried to revive the South Grand area, but if you venture the slightest bit off the beaten path you make yourself a target. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know anyone who has stayed in that area who hasn&rsquo;t had: At least one car stolen, their place broken into at least once, and been threatened at night just going about their business by black thugs. There is a Taco Bell in the area that has this revolving bulletproof carousel to do business through for the drive thru. Its resistant to about 50 caliber for a reason. Those pretty banners didn&rsquo;t make them take down their glass for protection. Nor should you let those banners influence you to drop your guard. </p>
<p>The Gangster Disciplines have open air drug markets there, and their customers are more than willing to hit you over the head with a bottle, or anything else just to take your money. A sign of the times: Many houses have steel cages welded around their air conditioning units. Black youth there are openly hostile to whites, and I honestly think the whites out riding at night by themselves are being naive to the dangers there. Until liberals learn the value of guns, get a CCW, and actually start a shooting war with the thugs this area will not improve. Anyone foolish enough to ride their bikes in that area at night is playing a game of roulette that eventually will land on black. </p>

<p>You are correct!  They DESERVED what they got and more. They will never wake up to the race problem and they will forever remain pro-minority. Karma has come home to roost. Isn&rsquo;t this what is called, the Stockholm Syndrome&#8221;? </p>
<p> Wonder how many of them are really &#8220;White&#8221; though. White has become a catch-all phrase. </p>

		<p>hey #15, can you point out some good places for me to drop off my stupid, liberal son in law from Germany? He thinks we are evil racists, and how racist this country is to have blacks live in ghettos, and has called me a racist several times.  He needs the wind of reality to blow around his nose. A good work over by some of his nice friends might not make sense to him, but it would serve him right. I thought of taking him for a night out in Memphis, but have never been there.<br>
My equally stupid daughter thought that vouchers to put blacks in white neighborhoods is a good idea.You spread them out thin so they will not be in contact with their own rotten eggs and the effect will wear off and they will become like whites. <br>

		<p>Every so often, there is a report of an attack on a bicyclist or walker on the Monon Trail (an old RR line from downtown to Carmel, Indiana). I suspect that all of these attacks are not reported as the IMPD has been beaten down by the &#8220;concerned ministers&#8221;. The local fishwrap &#8220;aka The Indianapolis Star&#8221; and the talking heads go ballistic every time some not too bright individual gets his bell rung by the cops. </p>
<p>It would be great if somebody dispatched one of these poor oppressed youths who is trying to relieve you of your bike and wallet. Fortunately, Indiana has wonderful CCW laws and reciprocity with most states. If you come for a visit and decide to walk on the Monon, make sure you can legally carry. </p>

<p>I feel for you. How have so many Whites and Germans became so poisoned against their own racial kindred? </p>
<p>The only thing I can figure out is that they did experimental (evil race based) injections into White babies many decades ago and in some it &#8220;took&#8221; and others, like yourself and me, it didn&rsquo;t take.</p>
<p> Before you think I am crazy, hear me out&hellip; WE have ALL  been brainwashed and filled with the same propaganda throughout the years, yet there are many White racialists who for some reason &#8220;rejected&#8221; that poison. Why?</p>

		<p>I am left wondering about this phenomenon of Black mob violence- obviously organized- and the recent unhinged race rhetoric directed by Black congressional &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; against the &ldquo;Tea Party&rdquo; (code for &ldquo;White people&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Certainly Black politicians are working under orders from the Obama white house to demonize &ldquo;Tea Party&rdquo; people&hellip; Who&rsquo;s directing the mobs?</p>

Every city or town I have ever lived in (I am 63 and travel a LOT) there are &#8220;community&#8221; centers, BLACKSETBALL courts, game rooms, social activities (arranged by evil YT) and STILL they do these sorts of things, the problem is THEY ARE BLACK and THAT IS WHAT BLACKS DO!!!

<p>Well, I would say it&rsquo;s the result of a few things having to do with first-hand, hard core experience with blacks such as:</p>
<p>1. Living in close proximity to black neighborhoods.</p>
<p>2.  Being forced to work around blacks, supervising them or being lorded over by them in your workplace.</p>
<p>3.  Your children attend a school or ride a bus that is more than about 3% black.</p>
<p>4.  Being robbed, beaten up, attacked or raped by blacks; someone you loved killed by blacks for no reason other than that your loved one was White with the police telling you &#8220;race had nothing to do with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>5.  Media lies that tell you black poverty and failure is due to White racism and oppression yet you see blacks using EBT cards at the supermarket while carrying the latest expensive electronic gadgetry and wearing $200 kicks.</p>
<p>6.  Being assigned as a teacher to a black school.</p>
<p>The media keep telling you that &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221; while reality shows you otherwise.  Blacks are more violent, impulsive and dangerous to be around than Whites.  So who are you going to believe?  The lying media?  Or your very own eyes?</p>
<p>IWO, it is the reality of every day life that makes for race realists; the awareness that everything the media, schools and government have told you about blacks is a lie, and a damned one at that.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

<p>Found this on STL Cop Talk.  This was a weekend overnight a few weekends ago.  If this would have developed into an actual hurricane and headed a bit north and a bit west, it would have slammed right into the white yuppie loft and party district, during the closing time of all the bars and clubs, and encountering all the departing yuppies.</p>
