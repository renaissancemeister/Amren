<h1><a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2011/08/09/third-flash-mob-attack-reported/">Group of Teens Randomly Attack Man on Kelly Drive</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS Philly, August 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On the same weekend that two men were beaten by violent mobs of teenagers in Center City spurring a police crackdown, another man now says he was randomly attacked on Kelly Drive.</p>
<p>Christopher Dean says he was biking along the drive around 6 p.m. on Sunday evening, July 31. It was a sunny day and plenty of people were out. He was between Boathouse Row and the Girard Avenue bridge heading west, he says, when he saw a group of four or five teenage boys standing by the side of the path. Suddenly, one of them stepped out toward his bicycle and punched him in the face.</p>
<p>Dean was hit so hard, he says he blacked out. Dean says the teens appeared to be between 15 and 18.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt literally like a blunt force nose of an airplane smacking into me full force. I think it was as hard as he could possibly hit somebody,&#8221; Dean said. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s hit you when something like that happens. It takes me three or four seconds probably to realize I&rsquo;ve just been punched.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dean says he managed to pedal another hundred yards before he was helped by two people having a picnic. Pictures show his face bleeding profusely. He needed stitches and his skull was fractured in three places, he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctors &hellip; said that&rsquo;s brass knuckles, the only way your skin can be opened up that way, that&rsquo;s brass knuckles,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dean&rsquo;s incident happened just two days after two other violent attacks by teenagers in Center City. On Friday night, July 29, one man was beaten at Walnut and Juniper, and another man was attacked at 15th and Sansom.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Monday, Mayor Nutter laid out a plan to prevent the so-called flash mobs, mostly by imposing a tougher curfew in Center City and University City on Friday and Saturday nights. The city is also keeping 20 recreation centers open later on those evenings to give kids something to do.</p>
<p>But none of that would have prevented Dean&rsquo;s incident, which occurred early in the evening and outside the new curfew zone.</p>

						<p><small><em>David Chang, NBC Philadelphia, August 11, 2011</em></small></p>
<p><br>
Three juveniles involved in a flash mob attack back in July turned themselves in on Wednesday, according to police.</p>
<p>On July 29, around 2 p.m., police say three Philadelphia teens attacked a 30-year-old man on 4th and Walnut.</p>
<p>The attack was captured on surveillance video. The video shows one student punching the man in the head and the others punching and kicking him. The attackers then fled and the man went to the hospital where he was treated for jaw injuries.</p>
<p>Police say that the teens are summer school students at Mastery Charter, located only a few blocks away from the attack. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two of the attackers surrendered to Central Detectives around 9 a.m. on Wednesday. The third attacker turned himself in Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s hardly original to say so, but Nutter&rsquo;s name fits him like a do-rag.  Does anyone seriously believe that normal human beings run out and beat someone half to death simply because they don&rsquo;t have &#8220;something to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, these <i>aren&rsquo;t</i> normal human beings.  They&rsquo;re Africans, and calling them &#8220;kids&#8221; or &#8220;teens&#8221; or &#8220;youths&#8221; isn&rsquo;t fooling anyone any more.<br>

<p>Seems like they didn&rsquo;t heed Mayor Nutter&rsquo;s sermon this past Sunday.  Gee, I wonder who predicted that?  Oh yeah, I know, everyone with a three digit IQ.  None of this will stop Nutter from becoming the new &#8220;conservative&#8221; hero!</p>

		<p>What was the name of the black prize winning journalist that in his autobigrahy admitted to running with his friends after a white bicyclist that had strayed into their neighborhood and beat the white man half to death. </p>
<p> Maybe these attacks on white people are merely preludes to future jobs in American journalism.</p>

		<p>RANDOM?  Not exactly.  This man was beaten up because he was white, and the perpetrators were black.  Brass knuckles have been around for decades - nothing new about that.  But if a perp is wearing them, then you know that premeditated violence is about to happen; otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t be wearing the knucks.  So here we have black youths premeditating severe violence against whites, and wearing weapons that will increase the severity of the deliberately targeted beatings.  Is there something I missed?</p>

		<p>this story takes it to another level. this is a state of war. i suggest to my fellow white people that they purchase a handgun and carry it. many might say well there is no ccw etc. i would say to them carry anyway because its better that you face some charge than to be disabled crippled disfigured permanant eye damage paralysis etc. i have been in jail and it is not so bad actually it was fun even though it was 10 to one blacks here in baltimore. even goetz only did 6 months and hes a skinny kind of nerdy looking engineer and he did ok. </p>

		<p>When I saw the first article yesterday, there were 173 comments at the time, much of which weren&rsquo;t very kind to blacks.  I notice that the comments section have now been removed.  The media refuses to allow Whites to demonstrate any solidarity of thought unless those thoughts are pro-minority in general and pro-black specifically.  Whites tend to follow trends.  If they think the &#8220;in thing&#8221; is to glorify black culture then that is what they will do.  If they see that it is no longer trendy then they will abandon the wagon en mass.  From what I saw, the comments found in the first article (while they were up) were showing that many Whites are losing patience with blacks.  Therefore, in my opinion, CBS Philly shut down the comments section to prevent impressionable Whites from seeing that other Whites, in huge numbers, are no longer willing to make excuses for their anti-White violence and intimidation tactics.  It might become trendy to show solidarity with their White race. </p>

		<p>They were male and teens?  If they are going to mention sex and age&hellip;.um, why not mention race?</p>
<p>Leaving out facts is a lie of omission.  Big brother don&rsquo;t want us to think bad thoughts.  Seriously, this is a form thought control   </p>

		<p>Where is Obama&rsquo;s Dept. of Justice to throw in &#8220;hate crime&#8221; charges?  Oh, I forgot, among liberals, only whites can hate.  Why does the video not show the faces of the criminals?  First the media lie by trying to avoid calling the Black perps Black.  Then they choose not to show their faces.  I worked in a court and we could not openly call the names of the juveniles accused.  We should not expose them as the criminals they are.   </p>

<p>I know that this will never get posted but the only solution is going to be that White intended victims need to defend themselves.<br>
We need body counts people!!! Anyone who attacks you on the street has the potential to disable you for life or kill you.  Stay alert if someone appears to be sneaking up behind you or appears ready to sucker punch you as you pass by, have your gun at the ready and take him out. Aim for the body mass and keep firing until the threat is ended. Just be careful not to hit any pain in the a  &mdash;   innocent bystanders.<br>
We have to play by the rules established by the Mau Mau. This is a guerrilla war and we need to &#8220;neutralize&#8221; the gorillas!  Oops! I meant, you know, the above word.</p>

		<p>The journalist&rsquo;s name is Nathan Mcall, and his autobiogrphy is titled &#8221; Makes Me Wanna Holler&#8221;. In this book Nathan Mcall boasts of hunting and assaulting whites and pounding them into the sidewalks during his young manhood. He doesn&rsquo;t change his attitude either as he grows older.<br>
Late in the book Nathan Mcall runs into one of his old buddies and the two black gentlemen,  now well dressed and well employed with Nathan having received awards in journalism for his work over his career, have a nice dinner in a popular restaurant. The topic of the conversation? How good it really felt to pound on the whites back in the day. <br>
This book is a must read for any white person; the first page will draw you in like a real life horror novel. Nathan Mcall writes well too, he is intelligent and industrious and one would never guess his past, or his true, racist nature.  </p>

<p> A white pharmacist in Oklahoma did exactly as you propose, while being robbed at gun point in his place of business. I believe he&rsquo;s now doing 20 to life after being found guilty of 2nd degree murder by a jury of his peers. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t agree with you, I do. However as whites, we are apparently held to a different standard in this &#8220;post-racial&#8221; America, even when defending our very lives from these people. <br>
