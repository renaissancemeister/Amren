<h1>Gangs in Small-Town Central Washington</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Claudia Rowe, Seattle Times, July 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Take a casual stroll through this Central Washington farm town and you&rsquo;d never guess what&rsquo;s going on. The streets are quiet. Men take leisurely afternoons to get their beards trimmed at the barbershop downtown. Motorists driving through, past fields of alfalfa and spearmint, are welcomed with a huge sign proclaiming Quincy the embodiment of &#8220;Opportunities Unlimited.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet this homespun place of 6,700 souls is also where a 25-year-old man was gunned down in broad daylight on a busy thoroughfare last spring, where cops had found a crowd of teenagers hiding a sawed-off shotgun in a couch several months earlier, and where the chief of police says a teenage girl was recently gang raped.</p>
<p>Nearby in Moses Lake last summer, U.S. marshals rounded up 50 suspected gang members  &mdash;  many of them with alleged ties to the Mexican Mafia.</p>
<p>Here is small-town Americana, a land of wide-open spaces, church socials and, increasingly, gang warfare.</p>
<p>Grant County, with a population hovering around 89,000, hardly dominates the national radar as a center for such activity. Yet the area logged nearly 100 robberies and shootings last year, all of them gang-related  &mdash;  including a 10-year-old boy shot in the head when his parents&rsquo; trailer was riddled with bullets, and a 13-year-old girl injured in a drive-by while she sat in her living room.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think this is a big, safe community, but it&rsquo;s all under the surface,&#8221; says Creeper, a 20-year-old high-school dropout from Moses Lake, and sometime member of the Marijuanos 13 set. &#8220;Believe it  &mdash;  we&rsquo;ve got PL, LVL, Florencia, Marijuanos, Nortenos. You got everything out here in Moses Lake you can think of.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} At the annual Moses Lake Spring Festival, held Memorial Day weekend, Deputy Joe Harris was stunned at the number of young people brazenly displaying their gang colors.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a city that doesn&rsquo;t have a gang problem, there sure were a lot of gang members walking around  &mdash;  just these packs of eight or 10 of them,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was eye-opening.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;You see these kids,&#8221; says Grinch, a Marijuanos O.G. [Original Gangster] in his 30s, gesturing at a crowd that had gathered in Quincy last winter to watch Creeper get his sixth tattoo. &#8220;They see us rap, drink. They all want in. All I have to do is ask, and they&rsquo;ll kill. It&rsquo;s that easy. Because this is not a choice for us. This is life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>We are on a rapid descent into anarchy.  Mark my words.  I mourn for the America that once was - up until just 20 years ago!  Liberals (race traitors) and conservatives (seekers of cheap labor) collided together to destroy the &#8220;City on a Hill.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s only a matter of time (2-3 decades at most).</p>

		<p>Several years ago, we had so many Bloods vs Crips at the school where I work, that everybody  &mdash;  including staff and teachers  &mdash;  could not wear &#8220;gang colors&#8221;. Ridiculous, because gangs change their colors frequently. So, no blue. No red. Than, no purple. No orange. Then, all the gangbangers started wearing white. So the principal said, to heck with it. We still have the gangs at school. Our population is mainly black, but when we get a hispanic kid, he&rsquo;s in a gang. This is in a nice suburb. Nice. Mostly white. Golf course.<br>
Adults: keep your eyes open for wierd graffitti, and report it. Your local cops probably have a cop (or a whole squad) dedicated to gangs  &mdash;  graffitti is a way to keep gang members informed. Secret language, symbols, codes&hellip;it&rsquo;s already in your neighborhood, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>

		<p> Small-town America needs a backlash against the gang/_____ (fill-in the blank) invasion. Any suggestions on how to make this type of activity disappear? How can it be eradicated to make rural America safe? It is easier to reclaim counties like the one described than to do it in Liberal Urban America. The will and the means is there in the Real America.</p>

		<p>If not for all these Mexicans and Guatemalans, inland Washington state would be emptying out like all the rest of the agricultural sectors of America.</p>
<p>The difference here in WA is the welfare benefits are second to none, all you need to get a drivers&rsquo; license is a pulse, and the Democrats are killing themselves trying to send illegal Mexican kids to our state colleges.  So they come here in droves.  Now the ones who actually do work make it impossible for a white man to make any money harvesting apples in the inland part of the state, and they&rsquo;ve done the same west of the mountains in the mushroom and brush-picking industry. </p>
<p>No matter, Washington state politics is all about facilitating the decline of the white man, be it in the apple orchards of Wenatchee, the forests of Shelton, or the marine waters where Judge Boldt found that the phrase &#8220;in common with&#8221; in an 1850s native treaty meant that Indians (who make up roughly two percent of WA fishermen) get to harvest half of the salmon, therefore destroying the white fishing industry in this state.  They are also the only fishermen allowed to extend their nets all the way across rivers.  And nobody can figure out what&rsquo;s happened to all the salmon&hellip;.</p>
<p>Last time I went camping in Wenatchee I was told that the &#8220;laborers&#8221; coming to Lincoln Rock State Park to play soccer were locked out of the restrooms because they just refuse to flush their toilet paper with their feces like civilized people and insist on throwing it in the trash like they do in the old country.</p>
<p>So their solution to the lockout was to defecate on the ground outside the door.  Oh diversity, how vibrant and enriching it is, with its rural gang violence and toilet habits hundreds of years behind Europeans.</p>

		<p>This article truly sickened me.  It&rsquo;s not what is happening in Quincy or Moses Lake, bad enough, it&rsquo;s that we are probably past the tipping point for the nation.  In 1997 the southern city that I live in wanted to be progressive and therefore it was necessary to hire a black police chief.  In the ten years he was in office there were indications of gang activity, i.e. spray paint gang signs, etc.  All during this time, he enacted policies that denied experienced, white males any chance of promotion, intentionally hired lesbians and foreign born staff, and in general, rising crime statistics seemed to be downplayed.  Many were puzzled by the lack of cooperation when calling the PD to report crimes and found that it was discouraged.  In time this man was promoted by the governor of the state to head the corrections system.  He has since been fired but not before his actions provided a warm and inviting environment for many gangs.  The citizens of my city are now afraid to be out at night, to go to the malls, and to walk alone in but a few neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Is this what is happening in other states?  Or are we all being held captive to a much larger and more insidious activity?  We all can guess and rant about our dark future but if you ask many in my city they will tell you that that future is today.  And will it soon be too late to travel America to see the sights, the historical places, and to enjoy a family vacation?  I feel as if this is but the tip of the iceberg and much worse awaits all of us.</p>

		<p>The hispanics have organizations that will look out for them and take care of problems.  The native born whites have Erick Holder and that is about it.  Which is to say they have nothing or worse than nothing since Holder is supporting the illegals against state immigration laws and will not enforce national laws against illegals.  If white gangs walked around in recognizable colors the Feds would be all over them and it would be international news.  Walking around in recognizable gang colors is a form of intimidation and projecting power.  it is only a question of time before open war as in Mexico breaks out in the US.  Playing kissy kissy with the illegals will not prevent that happening.  The utter spinelessness of the Feds is treason.  They allow a low scale invasion of the country by a foreign people and subject the US citizens to intimidation and crime by that foreign people.  Treason is the only term for it.</p>

		<p>To the poster who asked if this is happeneing in other small towns in other states - you betcha!  I have seen amerindian gangbangers in the whitest, most rural of places where there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be any reason for them to be there.  I drop my jaw continually and say, &#8220;Here too?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is the revenge of the Indians.  Our ancestors from Jamestown and Plymouth gradually fought the scattered Indians of this sparsely populated continent and pushed them out onto small reservations.  Now when our civilization has grown fat and lazy, their Indian cousins (amerindians from south of the border) are now invading us and pushing us aside.</p>

<p>No, poster 12. It isn&rsquo;t the &#8220;revenge&#8221; of the Indians. It is the deep hatred of our race from those who control (behind the scenes) the USA and Europe, not to mention Canada.</p>

		<p>The last few weeks of this, the youuutts running loose, have convinced me that only, and I mean ONLY, extreme measures will stop this madness.</p>
<p>It is getting worse. NOBODY other than people like us know it, discuss it. And, we all know there is ONLY one solution: Segregation.</p>
<p>The Blacks will not go back to that. They love being in the white world (would YOU want to go back to an all black world?).  Thus the outcome will require force of a nature that I dare not describe.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s sad to hear about Latino gangs which end up hurting or taking the lives of White people. Most of their crime is on each other or blacks. As I&rsquo;ve posted elsewhere, gangs aside I think most Latinos are honest, hard-working people. <br>
Unfortunately, they come here often with little or no money and our ultra-liberal government is waiting with hand-outs. Naturally, though still wrong, these immigrants take advantage of that. This is a terrible drain on our economy, but it&rsquo;s ultimately our liberal government&rsquo;s fault. <br>
I still say that we (Whites) should do what we can to align ourselves with the Latinos. They&rsquo;re not going away and they hate blacks with a passion for the most part.<br>
I also predict (quite obviously) major race wars between Latinos and blacks for decades to come as blacks continue to see &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhood get flooded with Mexicans, etc. <br>
What&rsquo;s been happening (Latino-black tension) in L.A. for quite sometime is spreading and will continue to. These two groups will keep battling more and more. It&rsquo;s not a matter of if but when and where.<br>
I know most on here disagree but reality must be weighed. Do we align ourselves with Latinos or &#8220;take on&#8221; every non-White? <br>
Sorry but I think blacks (and liberals) are, for the most part, the true threat/enemy, as they&rsquo;ve been for umpteen years. <br>
I will gladly align myself with Latinos, Asians, etc as they have no love, or respect, for blacks. These other groups have no white guilt and don&rsquo;t take any *hit. <br>
Bottom line: I think we have enough enemies between the blacks and the DISGUSTING white liberals. <br>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if &#8220;most&#8221; Latinos are hard working, I cannot agree about &#8220;honest&#8221; or any other moderating adjective.  </p>
<p>Latinos (or Hispanics) fill the police reports of most western state&rsquo;s communities.  Amren recently ran a story featuring the top ten most wanted by the FBI.  Listed as &#8220;white&#8221; they ere obviously Hispanic and had Spanish names.  My mind is filled with memories of frauds, burglaries, beatings of white children by Hispanics at schools, rapes, even murders of whites in Northern California, where I used to live.  However hard working they are, their labor isn&rsquo;t worth the price, economically or otherwise.</p>

		<p>I grew up in Yakima, WA. Attended public high school there in the early 1970&rsquo;s. Yakima was a pool then, and it is hopeless now. It is so bad that even the ghetto blacks have moved out in droves. The parts of town that used to be called &#8220;felony flats&#8221; and were completely black neighborhoods, are now wall-to-wall Mexicans, with nary a black face to be seen. The blacks were bad enough, but the Mexicans, with a sprinkling of central and South Americans added, are just unimaginably worse.</p>

		<p>the obama admin wants illegals here for the democrat votes so they wont stop the latino gangs. him identifying himself as black along with holder are on the side of the black gangs so posters calling for ins raids or national guard are not thinking clearly the police and authorities federal and otherwise are not a friend to the white man</p>

		<p>Hispanics (especially the illegal invading kind from Mexico) hate whites almost as much as they hate blacks. Aligning with a group who doesn&rsquo;t respect the sovereignty of the United States makes little sense, especially to those of white European stock. </p>
<p>Hispanics as a group are a corrosive force that will never be good for this country. They are like an invasive species, destroying everything in their path when they settle in large numbers. I know of no city with a large Hispanic population that does not look like ciudad de Tijuana. Who in their right mind would align with that? Has it come that that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard working Hispanics&rdquo; is a euphemism served up by the open borders advocates and their allies, in order to make their active invasion against this country seem more benign than it actually is. Breeding recklessly (hard work?)  while expecting tax payers to foot the bill is hardly a group I would want to associate with.  </p>
<p>We own nothing to Hispanics and they can in fact &#8220;go away&#8221; if we ever get a government willing to enforce immigration law, which I will not be holding my breath for anytime soon.<br>

		<p>18 - It&rsquo;s interesting to hear that Mexicans, as you see it, are even worse than the blacks.<br>
I&rsquo;ve had the opposite experience, so it&rsquo;s strange to hear that.<br>
Where I am (Staten Island, NY), the Mexicans have pushed blacks out of previously black areas and those neighborhoods have taken a turn for the better in every way imaginable. Crime went down, first and foremost.<br>
There&rsquo;s never Mexican on White crime. We don&rsquo;t get hateful looks either. <br>
I taught in all black schools and Mexican schools. It&rsquo;s like night and day. The Mexican students are really good and the parents are not ghetto (including the ones who speak English just fine).<br>
Perhaps it&rsquo;s very different in the West but that does surprise me and isn&rsquo;t consistent with other races/cultures. Blacks are blacks no matter where, just as Koreans are Koreans no matter where (I have no problem with Asians, however, or any other race except for blacks).<br>
I hate to come across as so doubtful, I&rsquo;m just surprised from my experiences here on the East.</p>

		<p>What I Believe @17:</p>
<p><b>I still say that we (Whites) should do what we can to align ourselves with the Latinos. They&rsquo;re not going away and they hate blacks with a passion for the most part.</b></p>
<p>Are you kidding?   They hate whites with a passion.</p>
<p>Have you seen neighborhoods in California that have been taken over by Hispanics?  The sidewalks are ripped apart, medians torn up, trees uprooted and gone, the dilapidated homes falling apart, old rusted cars up on blocks parked on dirt lawns, barnyard animals running around, used diapers strewn around, fast food wrappers littering the streets.  They are filthy and disgusting!</p>
<p>Why would I want to align with such a people who would just as soon kill me as look at me because I&rsquo;m white?  They covet what I have and will steal it to get it   &mdash;   lawn ornaments, Christmas decorations, yard fountains, all of these things will disappear from your yard when Hispanics move in, next will be your car!!</p>
<p>Hispanics only care about their own people and if you are white you are an enemy living on their land, is how they see it and what their activists tell them.  These low IQ&rsquo;d people are ethno-centric and will NEVER support whites.  When they have enough political power, starting in California, land WILL be redistributed from white owners to hispanics without possibility of compensation because they believe, after all, the land belonged to them in the fist place.</p>
<p>Yes, I do think it will come down to US against THEM, all others.  They hold deep grudges against our people, all of them, which they are taught by the media and schools.</p>

		<p>Well, obviously I have a very different experience with the Mexican population here in NY. <br>
Regardless, all I can say is this: Our country will obviously continue to go down the tubes. Our people are losing the battle which began with the blacks. Mexicans are certainly taking over and that will continue. <br>
The only bright side I can hang onto is that the blacks will go down as well. At least our great people will not go down alone. The blacks, who started the downward spiral of this once great country, will fall as well with this Mexican take over. <br>
I think the most unfortunate part of it all is there realistically nothing that can be done about it. <br>
Keep in mind that whether you see Mexicans as far worse than blacks or not even close to being as bad as blacks (as I see it), this country is/was going down regardless because of BLACKS. <br>
Despite your views on Mexicans, for me it&rsquo;s poetic justice to see blacks get a dose of their own medicine before this country crumbles away. <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time lately examining a demographic map I found on an article about segregation a few months ago, and it shocked me to find that there are some small counties in heavily-white states, such as Washington and Kansas, that are in fact heavily Hispanic.  Hispanics make up 41% of Yakima County, WA&rsquo;s population, 55% of Adams County, WA, are over 30% of the total in three rural Nebraska counties, and account for 40% or more in four rural counties in western Kansas (including 51% of Seward County&rsquo;s 22,000 residents).  They are also have a very strong presence in the Texas Panhandle, an area historically very white, making up 63% of the total of one small county.  And there are pockets of them in plenty more places you&rsquo;d never think to look, such as Dalton, GA (48% Hispanic), Lawrence, MA (74%), and Reading, PA (37-56%).</p>
<p>So, clearly, Hispanic immigrants no longer move only into big-city barrios.  They also go to the smaller cities, towns, and even rural areas of our country.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in looking at the map youself, it really is quite interesting and detailed, and invaluable if you&rsquo;re considering moving and want to find a good neighborhood (as it breaks down these statistics by census tract, an area usually containing no more than a few thousand people).  The map can be found at (http://projects.nytimes.com/census/2010/explorer).</p>
