<h1>California&rsquo;s Redistricting Plan Creates, Empowers Segregation</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dan Walters, San Francisco Examiner, July 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We Californians have been less willing to discuss a particularly sensitive aspect of that diversity  &mdash;  the emergence of what can only be called segregation.</p>
<p>Although the state long ago abolished legal segregation, we nevertheless tend to collect ourselves into enclaves, sometimes due to economic necessity but more often reflecting personal preferences to live among others with similar cultural, economic, linguistic, ethnic, generational or even political traits.</p>
<p>The geographic dividing lines among what are euphemistically called &#8220;communities&#8221; can be very stark, especially in densely populated urban areas, reaching an extreme level in the block-by-block turf wars of street gangs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s new redistricting commission fully embraced the &#8220;community of interest&#8221; concept and during countless hours of line-drawing, which reached a semifinal stage over last weekend, they bent over backward to accommodate demands from what its members called COIs.</p>
<p>To some extent, they had no choice. The federal Voting Rights Act, as interpreted by their legal adviser, required them to create a certain number of &#8220;majority minority&#8221; districts to maximize Latino political clout and to protect the interests of other ethnic groups. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The commission was created to stop politicians from drawing districts to benefit themselves and/or their parties, but in doing so, it gerrymandered another way. It gave official sanction to California&rsquo;s evolution  &mdash;  or deterioration  &mdash;  from a coherent society with a core of common values into an incoherent collection of clans.</p>

		<p>We are segregated ANYWAY   &mdash;   everybody who lives here knows what neighborhoods s/he can safely travel in, and which ones to stay away from.  It&rsquo;s de facto segregation all the way here, and always has been.  The difference is that now, unlike 40 years ago, some neighborhoods are so dangerous you can get killed if you aren&rsquo;t from there; there is a viciousness now that was never present in LA when I was coming up.  In the 1960&rsquo;s I could go (and did) to any neighborhood in the city, including ELA and Watts, and never fear for my life.  Now, I don&rsquo;t go to either of those places; I avoid Pacoima, Van Nuys, South Central, Inglewood   &mdash;   a whole lot of places.  Some of them are corridors to places I&rsquo;d like to go, but if I can&rsquo;t find another route I don&rsquo;t go there any more.  So if they&rsquo;re redistricting to emphasize the separation between the &#8216;hoods, they are only being honest about the way things are and have been for a long time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;California&rsquo;s evolution &mdash; or deterioration &mdash; from a coherent society with a core of common values into an incoherent collection of clans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coherent society:</p>
<p>California: 1960 percent non-Hispanic white: 92 <br/>
See 1960 Census data for California; scroll to Table 14:<br/>
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2bvoy3a" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2bvoy3a</a><br/>
[Calculation: White population  (14,455,230) divided by Total population (15,717,204) = 92 percent] </p>
<p>Incoherent collection of clans:</p>
<p>California: 2010 percent non-Hispanic white - 41<br/>
<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=california+demographics+2010+ethnicity" rel="nofollow">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=california+demographics+2010+ethnicity</a></p>
<p>The radical demographic transformation of California, against the will of its citizens, is one of the great triumphs of the federal judiciary (Plyler v. Doe in 1982, the nullification of Proposition 187 in 1995, automatic birthright citizenship for children of illegal alien parents) AND of the American Congress and Presidency (The Hart-Celler Immigration Act of 1965, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986) and countless smaller measures aimed the heart of America.</p>
<p>California is a harbinger.  The federal government will not rest until it has destroyed every state.  Just today the Obama launched a lawsuit against Alabama for seeking to enforce U. S. immigration laws. </p>

<p>That ship sailed when we got the amnesty and open borders you all demanded.  We got the diversity they wanted, then these white liberals act shocked when diversity does what it does, i.e. demand legislative gerrymanders.  Maybe the reason a writer for a Bay Area media outlet can have this opinion is because it costs nothing in terms of partisan politics   &mdash;   Almost everyone votes Democrat in the Bay Area, so partisan gerrymanders in the Bay Area are moot, and white liberals in the Bay Area don&rsquo;t have to worry about any Republicans winning anything in that region of California.</p>

		<p>So for decades we were bombarded with this vision of all races holding hands, singing kumbaya in glorious diversity and harmony. It was a vision used to justify all kinds of aggressive, expensive, usually unpopular desegregation schemes aimed at whites.</p>
<p>Now that they&rsquo;ve succeeded in turning large parts of the country into truly diverse, multi-ethnic societies where whites are no longer a majority, they&rsquo;re suddenly willing to embrace the idea of community separateness. They&rsquo;re willing to look on non-judgmentally as all of these different groups decide they prefer the company of their own kind.  </p>
<p>Amazing how attitudes change. It&rsquo;s almost as if, all along, the target wasn&rsquo;t so much &#8220;segregation&#8221; as it was simply white people and white communities. </p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t talk  about segregation? You need a hearing aid. All I ever hear about is how segregated we are and how it&rsquo;s one of the greatest evils in the world.</p>
<p><i>we nevertheless tend to collect ourselves into enclaves</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about that. Maybe people like to self-segregate. Maybe people like being with their own people. WHY is that seen as a BAD thing?</p>
<p><i>The geographic dividing lines among what are euphemistically called &ldquo;communities&rdquo; can be very stark, especially in densely populated urban areas, reaching an extreme level in the block-by-block turf wars of street gangs.</i></p>
<p>Oh I get it. It&rsquo;s the DENSITY that is the problem. Does that mean your solution to desegregation will include decreasing the density of communities or just certain groups in those communities?</p>
<p>More bleeding-heart liberal dreck on why we&rsquo;re supposed to feel guilty for not caring enough.  </p>

		<p>This fool acknowledges that people inately want to live by others similar to them, yet somehow concludes this is wrong and communities must be engineered to full diversity. <br/>
 Does &#8220;YUGOSLAVIA&#8221; mean anything to this guy? People forced into diversity will soon explode in violence most savage. Can we say &#8220;RWANDA&#8221;? Lets try &#8220;RUSSIA&#8221;. Does anybody remember the Austro-Hungarian empire?..neither do they.<br/>
 Different groups of people get along best when they are separate from each other. The safest countries are the most homogenous. We here all know what is coming not too far down the road. We will be fully Balkanized within 2 generations.</p>

		<p> The writer sounds like another White liberal, made extremely uncomfortable and wringing his hands because the state probably won&rsquo;t force law-abiding (White and Asian, mostly) people to live cheek-by-jowl with urban thugs (black and Hispanic, mostly).</p>
<p> But it just underlines a fact of human nature: Birds of a feather, flock together. Like prefers like. We prefer to live near, and associate mostly with, people who look, sound and act like us.</p>
<p> The multi-culti people don&rsquo;t like that, with their pipe dreams of a &#8220;glorious tapestry of diversity,&#8221; but there it is: A fact of human nature.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve spent 60 + years twisting and turning the voting lines in an effort to maximize minority participation and increase the number of elected officials of color, and only for persons of color. What a coincidence, they&rsquo;ve spent the last 60 + years WRITING and TEACHING us that people of color are being disenfrancised, by the very efforts made to increase the impact of the minority vote. </p>

		<p><i>districts to maximize Latino political clout and to protect the interests of other ethnic groups.</i></p>
<p>Nonsense.  The idea was to break up the so-called white power structure using blacks and latinos as battering rams.  Do you think white ethnic interests were considered by the redistricting commission when the new voting districts were being formed? <br/>
I&rsquo;ll give you a hint:   NO</p>
<p><i>It gave official sanction to California&rsquo;s evolution &mdash; or deterioration &mdash; from a coherent society with a core of common values into an incoherent collection of clans.</i></p>
<p>California has been dissolving and devolving into madness since 1965, since the borders were thrown open allowing poor, destitute Mexican to flood into the state in massive numbers closing hospitals, destroying the once first world school system,  overburdening the welfare system, bringing in an increase in violence, all without end.</p>
<p>What common values?  California hasn&rsquo;t had &#8220;common values&#8221; in almost 50 years and Mr. Walters knows it.</p>
<p><i> the state probably won&rsquo;t force law-abiding (White and Asian, mostly) people to live cheek-by-jowl with urban thugs (black and Hispanic, mostly).</i></p>
<p>Wayne:  The state has already been doing this for years by shoe-horning Section 8 housing into nice white areas.  I am seeing an increase in this lately.  The once-white inland empire has been destroyed by this insidious process. Other foremerly white, nice neighborhoods, block by block, are being torn up and destroyed from forced &#8220;low income housing.&#8221;  One of many reasons whites and businesses are fleeing the state in droves   &mdash;   and one of THE main reasons California is destitute and on the brink of bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>What did the evil politicians think was going to happen after productive whites are driven out of the state?  But then maybe a violent, majority-minority state and bankruptcy were the plans all along.</p>
<p>Dan Walters, BTW,  works out of Sacramento, his home paper is the Sac Bee.  His columns are carried by 50 local news outlets all the way to the Mexican border.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really matter anymore. CA is so liberal now redistricting is a moot point. It is on its way to becoming a latino state, sprinkled with other exotic races, and liberal whites. Districting shouldn&rsquo;t really mean anything.</p>
<p>IMHO, whites should be required to be out of CA by a certain date. That&rsquo;s for their own safety. Eventually the Mexicans will force others out anyways. Me - I&rsquo;m outta here next year when I retire. </p>

		<p>Poster #2 - actually, before the census of 1970, the only census in which Hispanics were considered non-white was the census of 1930 (when anyone putting &#8220;Mexican&#8221; was removed from the white category).  California in 1960 was not 92% non-Hispanic white, but rather 92% white, including white Hispanics.  But I would guess it was still at least 70 or 80% non-Hispanic white at that time.</p>
