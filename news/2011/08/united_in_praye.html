<h1>United in prayer: March honors legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Scott Carroll, Commercial Appeal, August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Standing near the entrance to Downtown&rsquo;s Clayborn Temple Sunday evening, Nina Tayloe grabbed the hands of 75-year-old Brown Berry, dropped to her knees and cried out for forgiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Forgive me on behalf of my family for the ugliness of that time &hellip; but praise God, we have a beautiful Lord who brings about hope and restoration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berry, a young black man in Memphis during the civil rights movement and sanitation workers strike, nodded his head in acceptance and embraced the 59-year-old white woman.</p>
<p>Before the crumbling steps of a shuttered church closely associated with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., more than two dozen people  &mdash;  including clergy from Christian denominations across Memphis  &mdash;  gathered at 6 p.m. for a prayer march remembering his legacy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prayers were focused on family, church, education and the upcoming &#8220;Great Day of the Dreamers,&#8221; an event commemorating the 48th anniversary of King&rsquo;s &#8220;I Have a Dream Speech,&#8221; as well as the dedication of a memorial in his honor in Washington.</p>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s OK for whites to apologize (read admit guilt) for something their ancestors did 300-200 years ago, then it must be okay for society to blame all blacks for the chronic crime and failure committed by such a large percentage of their race.</p>

		<p>I looked at the prominent photo on the original article.  Needless to say, I wasn&rsquo;t pleased.  Because AR has standards, I won&rsquo;t give my metaphorical interpretation of the photograph.  Just my saying that should be an indicator to what I&rsquo;m thinking.</p>
<p>Did Nina Tayloe murder Martin Luther King?  Did she have any criminal culpability in the series of events that led to his assassination?  The way this article is written, all white Memphis might as well assassinated him, when in &#8220;reality,&#8221; (supposedly and officially), an escapee from the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City and an on-again off-again St. Louisan who somehow was able to live on the lam for more than a year was able to plan the assassination, follow MLK around, do the deed, escape, cross into Canada, then afford airfare from a Canadian city to London and again from London to Rhodesia, (he was arrested in London), in the days when any airline ticket was expensive, much more two long international flights not booked in advance.  Definitely something fishy about that &#8220;official&#8221; story.</p>

		<p>What a disgusting sight. A so-called &#8220;white&#8221; person on her knees to a black asking forgiveness. It&rsquo;s no wonder that many think White Christians are crazy. </p>
<p>This PC nonsense that poses as Christianity today, will most certainly destroy the White race. Even &#8220;conservative&#8221; Christians believe all this nonsense that their pastors/churches have been telling them for decades now. </p>
<p>Thank God, (I am a true White Christian) I do not believe one lick of what they are preaching as I know they are following the false one. </p>
<p>The Church has been infiltrated and taken over just as our government, military, our schools, our institutions, media, etc. has been. </p>
<p>Does anyone really think that the Church wouldn&rsquo;t be infiltrated? They were the first on the list, so as to get Whitey through their faith, and fill their heads with love everybody, pray for your enemy, turn the other cheek, be nice, don&rsquo;t offend anyone, take care of the whole world, we are all the same, and the list just goes on and on.</p>
<p>This is why we have that &#8220;white&#8221; person on her knees asking forgiveness to some black guy! Wonder what God is thinking right now.   </p>

		<p>As a white woman, I can&rsquo;t even begin to explain how the photo of that woman on her knees makes me feel, so I won&rsquo;t even try. It&rsquo;s a feeling only another female race realist can understand. </p>

		<p>If blacks were honest with themselves they would be THANKING White America for giving them the highest standard of living for blacks in the World. Even the poorest black lives like an African King would in the motherland.</p>
<p>Blacks have received more than the reparations they are trying to weasel out of the government many times more over the last 200 years.</p>
<p>Will these blacks ever wake up and learn to do for themselves?</p>

		<p>The only disgust I have for my ancestors is that they didn&rsquo;t win the Southern War for Independence.  </p>
<p>This misguided fool Nina has gotten herself so lathered up and  emotional on (fake) Christianity that she&rsquo;s defenseless against any harebrained suggestion.  </p>
<p>Nina Tayloe reminds me of the white aid worker who was gang raped by blacks in Haiti.  Through god awful circuitous logic she found a way to blame the white man for it. </p>
<p>Bet old Nina regularly drives to Starbucks in her electric car plastered with Obama stickers to sip expensive hot water and cackle on and on with like minded fools about The One.</p>
<p>Tayloe&rsquo;s emotional display reminds me of a Southern Baptist convention back in the 90&rsquo;s where white men came up on stage and washed the feet of black men as atonement for white sins against Africans. Made me want to vomit; the white men&rsquo;s actions and the thought of the stinky feet.   </p>
<p>In the good old days the Baptists, the K, and the law were all one happy organization.  Wrong? Perhaps.  But at least white people of that era didn&rsquo;t feel the need for CCW as they do now. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Men of the Valley&hellip;..The Lincoln administration required us to raise three regiments&hellip;&hellip;Tell him we have done so&#8221;</i>. Gods and Generals, Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s speech. </p>

		<p>You know, it&rsquo;s funny to see that woman, in that position, in front of that black man. MLK, being the whoremonger that he was, would have enjoyed seeing that as an honoring to his name. </p>
<p>She is obviously a mentally ill woman bowing down before her black god. She worships at the church of white guilt. It is sad to see an adult acting that silly. </p>

  <br>
&ldquo;Before the crumbling steps of a shuttered church closely associated with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., more than two dozen people &mdash; including clergy from Christian denominations across Memphis &mdash; gathered at 6 p.m. for a prayer march remembering his legacy.&rdquo;  Any and everything that is associated with &ldquo;The Good Doctor&rdquo; seems to be in a state of falling apart, crumbling, collapse, and deterioration.  Case in point: this country&rsquo;s government and its agencies fall all over themselves vomiting platitudes to this man.  </p>
<p>What does the article have to do with the essence of Christianity?  One must ask the question, was the European American/European person better-off before or after the arrival to prominence of Dr. Martin Luther King?  Before the arrival of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a White person would, certainly, not bow down before one.  What would possess a White person, with any pride and character, to represent him or herself in such a submissive way?<br>

******************************</p>
<p>I remember that and it made me sick to my stomach that ANY White man would do such blasphemy. Especially so-called Christians. </p>
<p>That is when I really KNEW that we are living in the age of fake Christianity. I quit &#8220;church&#8221; a long time ago because of their racial insanity and brotherhood of man&hellip; I read and listen to my online Church. It is all that keeps my sanity in this upside down America and all White nations have succumbed to.</p>
<p>I bet those black guys got a big laugh out of that later. </p>

		<p>I am not very familiar with the details of American history, so I wonder: how long has it been since Lincoln freed the Black slaves?</p>
<p>Does the Black community expect things such as affirmative action and White guilt trips such as this one, to go on until, I don&rsquo;t know.. maybe the year 2311, three hundred years from now? Just how many generations of Whites must apologize to please the Blacks? </p>
<p>The kinds of judicial systems we have in the West, do not consider the children of an offender to be responsible for the crimes of their father (or mother), so I am convinced this just has to end, at some point. </p>

		<p>At anon 3:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to hear your church is focused on short-term political issues rather than the truths of the gospel.  Whereas I&rsquo;ve not experienced that problem personally, it appears that too many churches have lost focus on essential doctrines for whatever political message is in vogue  &mdash;  a shallow and self-defeating strategy.  </p>
<p>It is pathetic people feel responsible for the actions of their ancestors.  It is not only illogical (people unborn cannot do anything about the past), but it is counterproductive.  Slavery was experienced by zero blacks today, but they continue on feeling this &#8220;pain&#8221; only because a complicit white population continues to play along.  Like veterans returning home from the traumas of war only to live out the scenarios again in &#8220;counseling sessions,&#8221; dwelling on past racial-relations does not &#8220;heal&#8221; any wounds&hellip;it only creates them.</p>
<p>Futhermore, we here at AmRen all know about MLK.  It is amazing his legacy continues  &mdash;  despite the affairs, the swearing, the socialism, the plagarism, etc.  The worse thing that could have happened was that he was assassinated and became a martyr.  </p>

		<p>A more despicable sight, I have never seen. <br>
Even worse, the kind sick and twisted psyche this woman has can only germinate in a sick and twisted society.<br>
How many other people with this diseased mindset are spread throughout America, as well as other western countries?<br>
I&rsquo;m not sure who it was that said it first; paraphrasing: we can survive an Obama presidency, but can we survive a people who elected him?</p>
