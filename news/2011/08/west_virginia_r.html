<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><em>William Johnson is chairman of American Third Position, a political party that is pledged to support &#8220;elected representatives necessary to return our nation to its rightful owners.&#8221; American Third Position wanted to buy radio ads for its candidate for governor of West Virginia, Harry Bertram.

Vote Harry Bertram for Governor, the American Third Position Candidate. The Democratic party and the Republican Party have both failed us.

		<p>Amazing.  The Black Caucus, The Black Panthers, hard to list all the organizations and ads and speeches that mention Black America. CNN runs a series called &#8220;Black in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>How did it ever get to this?  The use of the term &#8220;white&#8221; is forbidden in public to describe whites, except if it is for some criticism of whites or as a pejorative.  </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re cowards, plain and simple.  People like that are the root cause of why this nation is in such a mess.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d omit the word white and run the ad.  I think that the message will still get through big time (do not omit multiculturalism or massive immigration).  Sometimes, we must take a step back to take two steps forward.<br>

		<p>I would think that clearly falls under discrimination by race civil rights laws. That said I believe I would have just chosen the word conservative over white and picked up more votes and less hassle, most whites would have gotten the more subtle point anyway.</p>

		<p>I grew up in WV and now live just across the Ohio River.  I&rsquo;m gratified to know that a gubernatorial candidate believes it&rsquo;s a good political strategy to appeal to white people in WV  &mdash;  because IT IS.  The state has only a small minority of blacks and few Hispanics, but even there people can see the writing on the wall.<br>
If I still lived in WV, Mr. Bertram would have my vote for certain.</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all. Those on the right allowed the left to turn &#8220;white&#8221; into a dirty word a long time ago, when they made the terms &#8220;white consciousness&#8221; or, God forbid, &#8220;white pride&#8221; synonymous with the term &#8220;white supremacy.&#8221; </p>
<p>Part of the reason this happened is that the right refused to bring up the IQ issue back in the 1960s when they had a chance and when thinkers like Charleton Putnam were urging them to, leaving the only explanation for nonwhite failure as white &#8220;oppression&#8221; and white &#8220;bigotry.&#8221;</p>

		<p>How about &#8220;European America&#8221; in the place of &#8220;White America&#8221;?</p>
<p>If the radio station would accept that, it might soften up prejudice enough to say &#8220;White America&#8221; later.</p>
<p>But I hope A3P can first make a big enough stink about their ad being rejected in its present form that plenty of West Virginians will hear about the A3P party.</p>
<p>Hey, the party has already succeeded in getting mentioned in Amren! :)</p>
<p>A3P is a very exciting effort directed by some top notch people. Here&rsquo;s its website:</p>

		<p>It fine for La Raza and the NAACP to make direct references to their color and ethnicity, but whites can&rsquo;t.  There is the Hispanic community, the black community but the recognition of a white community is offensive to the press.  Now that is a story all by itself.</p>

		<p>I imagine the A3P party realized there was a very high probability that the ad would be rejected. But by wording it as they did, they can maybe bargain down to something slightly &#8220;milder&#8221; that might not have been accepted if they had led with it. And also, as I said, hopefully they can use the rejection to generate publicity.</p>
<p>The A3P party is very determined to avoid divisive internal squabbles of the sort that have hampered previous white political efforts, and is determined to &#8220;mix it up&#8221; in mainstream politics and give our movement a true political presence.</p>
<p>I believe we are all welcome to get on board!</p>

		<p>I have felt for some time that the biggest strategic error made by the A3P was that they came out as explicitly being a party for White people.  They could have had exactly the same positions on all the issues but avoided the explicit pro-white talk and they&rsquo;d be a respectable party.  As it is A3P must fight a terrible uphill battle.  Not only do they have the same problems of access that all non-Republicrat parties have, but they constantly have to fight the &#8220;Nazi&#8221; label and get denied air time for daring to be pro-white.  Yes, I am recommending a degree of subterfuge but let&rsquo;s face it, our opponents have been damn sneaky lying bastards for decades.  As in Great Britain, a lot of people are desperately seeking a party that will slash immigration, but are easily scared away by the &#8220;Nazi&#8221; and &#8220;White supremacist&#8221; labels slapped on by the media.</p>

		<p>I just heard the commercial today on the Alex Jones show and it was slick sounding but also seamlessly blended in with other Patriot movement related advertising. Jones will keep it on until he gets enough heat from listeners or other sponsors, just like he did with the Scriptures for America ads. Although he talks realistically about tribal loyalty and allegiances being normal and healthy, that is as far as he is willing to go along that sort of reasoning.   </p>

		<p>Maybe West Virginia law is different, but at least under federal law as I understand it, a media outlet is required to take any paid advertisement from a political candidate. A few years ago there were some particularly disturbing scenes in an ad run by a pro-life candidate (in South Carolina, if memory serves me right). The ads were run, but the station provided advance notice of them so that anyone who wanted to avoid seeing them could do so. I would think the same kind of thing might apply here. Looks to me like Harry Bertram has a case.</p>

<p>TLDR version: Victory is not getting a bigger piece of the pie through advancing the Euro-American cause. Victory is defeating the racial spoils system,aa,wealth redistrubution, etc and then letting our inherent advantages regain all that was &#8220;taxed&#8221; away from us through participation in a true free market economy.</p>

<p>So what? What is wrong with WN and the 14 words? You are afraid of stereotypes? This is the reason so many Whites will never get it or make any headway. We have to be strong and HONEST in our purpose and by watering down the word, White, is a sure way to defeat our cause. Haven&rsquo;t we been doing this for decades now, so as not to &#8220;offend&#8221; others sensibilities? </p>
<p>As for your suggestion, &#8220;&ldquo;We must find a way to preserve America and American values for the sake of posterity.&rdquo; is ridiculous. </p>
<p>This has been said many times before and the &#8220;America&#8221; you refer to consists of any nonwhite with the name &#8220;American&#8221; after his race! So you think that most Whites will pick up on that?  </p>
<p>Nope.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a bit stunned at all the posts above that seem to agree that use of the word &#8220;white&#8221; was a mistake. One poster even called it &#8220;low brow sensationalism,&#8221; which I hope was a bit of brilliant irony.</p>
<p>We must put forward the word &#8220;white&#8221; at every opportunity, and fight for the right to do so (and I regret if my posts above gave the opposite impression). The fight we are engaged in is explicitly a racial fight, and using the word &#8220;white&#8221; will impress that fact on the only minds that don&rsquo;t already get it, the minds of whites.</p>
<p>Subterfuge (as one poster recommended) may occasionally be necessary, but its adoption as a general policy saps the spirit of an organization and leads to confusion and sell-out.</p>

		<p>White Indo European people have never been free to say or think what they want - in the Middle Ages you could get arrested and tortured for saying that the earth revolves around the Sun, instead of the way we know it to be now. Under Communism - socialism, Whites in Eastern Europe had to watch what they said - that&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>We have similar situations today - and it just takes some finesse. This ad would work fine by using &#8220;Americans&#8221; instead of &#8220;White Americans&#8221; - the audience would get what was being said.</p>
<p>The key to our success is implicit White nationalism - just make a few adjustments to taylor our message to different audiences. Try to resist the urge to tell the WHOLE TRUTH in a 30 second advert.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no reason to give them the rope to hang you with. Besides, the message is more powerful without that last line. It denounces Republicrats, outsourcing, national debt, multiculturalism and immigration. That&rsquo;s a powerful message. There&rsquo;s no need to say anything more. People will get it.</p>
<p>Just say this&hellip;</p>
<p><i>Vote Harry Bertram for Governor, the American Third Position Candidate. The Democratic party and the Republican Party have both failed us. Corporations export our jobs overseas; America is insolvent. Multiculturalism and massive immigration are destroying America&rsquo;s heritage. Reject the Republicans; reject the Democrats.

Amazing. The Black Caucus, The Black Panthers, hard to list all the organizations and ads and speeches that mention Black America. CNN runs a series called &ldquo;Black in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did it ever get to this? The use of the term &ldquo;white&rdquo; is forbidden in public to describe whites, except if it is for some criticism of whites or as a pejorative. </p>
<p>How did it get to this?  I&rsquo;ll answer that.  50 years of brainwashing by leftist.  I also blame World War II and the Nazi Party.  Ever since the Third Reich, the rest of the world gets nervous when white men with guns get together to talk about change. In other words, there has been an opposite and equal reaction to what they did.   <br>

		<p>I agree with Harumphty Dumpty, if you mean white americans say so. Or is it every time one hears the term Americans in the main stream media all whites are supposed to wink and say, those main stream media-always-on-our-side guys mean us whites?</p>
<p>The problem is, the Ad begins with, &#8220;(both parties) have failed us&#8221; </p>
<p>Meaning americans of all hues and colors&hellip; and then it ends with &#8220;we must secure a future for white america and our children&#8221; </p>
<p>But what can you expect from the third way, a group the left paints as neo-nazi influenced? a group arguably worse than the main-stream media themselves? </p>
<p>Of course, as anyone knows who followed Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8216;Banned in Halifax&rsquo; appearance, the media wont run the paid ad no matter what it says. </p>

		<p>The radio station seem to be pretty obviously thumbing its nose at the law:<br>
http://www.broadcastlawblog.com/tags/fcc-political-advertising-rule/<br>
<i>While it is not illegal for a station to run a state or local candidate&rsquo;s ad when the ad does not have a candidates voice in it, there are important ramifications for the station if the spot is not a &#8220;use&#8221;.</i><br>
(&hellip;)<br>
<i>Most importantly for the stations, if the spot does not have the candidates voice or picture in it, the spot is not covered by the &#8216;No censorship&#8221; provision of Section 315 of the Communications Act.  That provision prohibits a station from rejecting a candidate&rsquo;s ad based on its content.  But, because the station can&rsquo;t reject the ad based on its content, the station has no liability for the contents of the ad.</i></p>

		<p>He should just substitute White for Caucasian or western or occidental, Anglo-Saxon, or European descendants. Its just semantics, not a big deal really, White is rather unscientific anyway, kind of in line with the notion that race is just color anyway.
