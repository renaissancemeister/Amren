<h1>From Lynwood to Florida, Saggy Pants Under Assault</h1>
  
<p>Steve Schmadeke and Dennis Sullivan, Chicago Tribune, August 23, 2011</p>

</div> 


<p>When police arrived outside a Lynwood party last month to check for curfew violators, Bowen High School student Cantrell Tremble, 18, wasn&rsquo;t worried about getting a ticket. So he was surprised when police cited him for the way he wore his pants.</p>
<p>&#8220;(The officer) looked and saw &hellip; I was sagging,&#8221; Tremble said recently. &#8220;It&rsquo;s very unfair. Everybody dresses the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the case against Tremble was dropped after the ticketing officer didn&rsquo;t appear at a hearing, a Tribune review of police records found that south suburban Lynwood is assessing fines as high as $750 for those caught wearing sagging pants in public. Police, who say the $750 fines were made in error, more commonly assessed fines of $50 to $250.</p>
<p>In 2008, Lynwood was the first Chicago suburb to enact a ban on low-hanging pants, but others have followed suit. The most recent was neighboring Sauk Village, which in March outlawed pants that hang more than 4 inches off the hip. Last month, Collinsville, just east of St. Louis, narrowly approved its own saggy-pants ordinance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Illinois American Civil Liberties Union criticized the ordinance as racial profiling when it was enacted but has yet to challenge it in court. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Lynwood leaders, the ordinance is a way to take a stand against a fashion many find offensive or indecent. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Florida recently enacted a &#8220;Pull Up Your Pants&#8221; bill, requiring school districts in the Sunshine State to discipline students who wear &#8220;clothing that exposes underwear.&#8221; Pastors have reportedly marched the streets of Winston-Salem, N.C., urging residents to &#8220;pull them up,&#8221; and a South Carolina man recently released a children&rsquo;s book titled &#8220;Oliver Vance Pull Up Your Pants!&#8221;</p>
