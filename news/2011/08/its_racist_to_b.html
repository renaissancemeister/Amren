Meet the Indian Husband in Immigration Battle Who Refuses to Learn English and Is Calling on Others to Join Him</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sanjay Jha and David Williams, Daily Mail (London), August 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Indian man challenging immigration laws which block non-English speakers from coming to live in Britain said yesterday he hopes &#8216;many other people&rsquo; will come if he wins.</p>
<p>Talking about his case for the first time, Vali Chapti, a farmer who wants to join his wife in Leicester, also insisted that he would never learn English.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Daily Mail in his remote village, he said he could easily &#8216;get by&rsquo; without English because there were many Gujarati speakers in Leicester and it would be the main language where he would live.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old also branded Britain&rsquo;s immigration system &#8216;racist and discriminatory&rsquo; and said his human rights had been breached in a &#8216;disgraceful way&rsquo; by rules introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May requiring immigrants to have a basic command of English.</p>
<p>His wife Rashida, 54, has begun a court challenge funded by legal aid against the rules, which are aimed at ensuring immigrants can integrate into British society.</p>
<p>Mr Chapti said he was confident his case would be successful and added that hoped to bring one of his sons with him to the UK.</p>
<p> &#8216;How can the British Government deny me the right to live with my wife at this late stage of my life because I am unable to speak the language?&rsquo; asked Mr Chapti, who has been married for 37 years.</p>
<p>He said several of their seven children had previously applied for visas to join their mother but they too had been turned down.</p>
<p>Mr Chapti, who has seen his wife once in the past six years, said: &#8216;I have faith in the right of a husband and wife to be together. I want to come as soon as I can to England.</p>
<p>&#8216;However long it takes we will fight until we receive justice in this case. If we are rejected, we will appeal again and again for our human rights to be respected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he claimed that if the challenge is successful, it will set a precedent that will &#8216;open the gates&rsquo; for other spouses around the world kept apart by the rules introduced as part of the Government&rsquo;s attempts to curb net immigration.</p>
<p>&#8216;My wife may be fighting for me, however when we win the victory it will help so many other people who want to come to the UK but can&rsquo;t due to the present immigration law making English mandatory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Chapti said he had dropped out of school aged nine  &mdash;  he can barely read or write in his mother tongue, Gujarati  &mdash;  and has no intention of trying to learn English.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s not easy to learn a foreign language late in life especially when I have not even finished my proper education at school in India and, except Gujarati, I don&rsquo;t speak any other language properly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The High Court challenge last week provoked widespread debate, with Mrs Chapti claiming that even though her husband would not learn the language if he was given permission to join her at the home she shares with relatives in Leicester, he would be able to work in the clothes factory where she is a machinist.</p>
<p>She moved to the UK with her parents six years ago, travelling on a British protected passport first issued when the family lived in Malawi, Africa, then a British colony.</p>
<p>Later, Mrs Chapti successfully applied for naturalisation as a British citizen, then attempted to &#8216;send for&rsquo; her husband and youngest child.</p>
<p>Manjit Gill, QC, representing Mrs Chapti, told the High Court in Birmingham the challenge to the new rules was based on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which protects the right to a &#8216;private and family life&rsquo;, and Article 12, the right to marry.</p>
<p>The case also argues that the language tests for non-EU migrants discriminate on race grounds against migrants from India, Pakistan and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Throughout the debate one crucial voice had been missing  &mdash;  that of Mr Chapti. Yesterday the Mail traced him to the farming area of Valan, some 250 miles from Mumbai.</p>
<p>The community of 15,000 is dominated by seven mosques and has strong ties to Leicester and Blackburn, with families regularly sending money back to loved ones. Unlike many similar towns, there is no English language learning centre. </p>
<p>Of his lack of English, Mr Chapti said: &#8216;I do not think it will be any kind of problem for me  &mdash;  my wife can speak and understand some English and relatives speak it very well. Why should it be a problem?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Chapti, a deeply devout Muslim who prays five times a day at the mosque, divides his time in Valan between his family farm and religious work, teaching the virtues of Islam and spending 45 days each year touring religious shrines.</p>
<p>He follows a strict Islamic lifestyle and unlike neighbours has no TV in the three-bedroomed mud-brick home with a flat tile roof that he shares with six family members.</p>
<p>His income of around £4 a week, made working the family&rsquo;s eight acres of land, is augmented by money sent from two sons living in Africa.</p>
<p>Of the Chaptis&rsquo; five sons and two daughters, only one has visited their mother in the UK. &#8216;We don&rsquo;t ask my wife for any money as she is struggling to save money from her meagre salary of a machine operator in a hosiery factory,&rsquo; Mr Chapti said.</p>
<p>She earns around £200 a week, but also works part-time as a machinist at a second factory when work is available, which adds around £400 a month to her income. Her monthly rent amounts to £525. </p>
<p>So determined are the Chaptis to save money to buy visas that Mrs Chapti did not return home four months ago for the marriage of one of her sons, Javed.</p>
<p>&#8216;I missed my mother at the most important function of my life but I guess she is busy in fighting for our rights,&rsquo; said Javed at his shop at the main market in Valan.</p>
<p>He said the whole family first applied for visas in 2008 but were refused. </p>
<p>They applied the following year with the same result. &#8216;We have spent a lot of money in all this process and feel disappointed at not getting a favourable result,&rsquo; said Javed.</p>
<p>The family see Mrs Chapti as a &#8216;champion of human rights&rsquo; and are confident she will win the case.</p>
<p>Another son, Juned, said: &#8216;My mother is a very brave lady and fighting this case to bring justice for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last night Mrs Chapti said: &#8216;If we win this case, others in India and other countries will also benefit. I am fighting for my husband and all those other people too, who deserve the chance to come to the UK to be with their partners.</p>
<p>&#8216;If I lose, I can take the case to a higher court  &mdash;  the European Court of Human Rights.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>If they charge him with a crime there would be no ethical problem separating him from the larger society, or keeping him away from the British. It may very well be a moral crime, him wanting to move to England.</p>

<p>Besides the usual hue and cry of &#8216;racism&rsquo; found in every story in the world, the British Government isn&rsquo;t denying him anything. All Mr. Illiterate needs to do is scrape up enough money to get his wife a one-way ticket back to the Ganges River.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s partly right  &mdash;  it IS hard to learn another language late in life. However he has been married to a British woman for 37 years, since he was 20 years old (if he&rsquo;s 57 now) and he was certainly young enough to learn a new language then. If he has no intention of even trying to learn to speak English, he doesn&rsquo;t need to live in England. Seems he and his wife have been managing their marriage quite well for the past 37 years, (how?) so just keep on doing what you&rsquo;ve been doing in the past, no need to move now.</p>

		<p>And since he&rsquo;s so &#8220;late&#8221; in his life what does he plan on doing in England to support himself and his family? I&rsquo;m guessing nothing, because in this fools mind to deny him welfare is &#8220;racist&#8221; too.</p>

		<p>Balderdash!  It is NOT this man&rsquo;s (or anyone&rsquo;s) RIGHT to immigrate to any country.  If he&rsquo;s not willing to play by the rules, then he doesn&rsquo;t get to play.  That is the correct procedure in my book.  If he is too lazy and/or stupid to learn English, then he certainly won&rsquo;t be a positive asset to England; rather, he&rsquo;ll be a liability.  And England, like all European countries, does NOT need any more liabilities right now.  I say keep the creep in India until he straightens up and does what&rsquo;s required.  If he chooses not to, he stays in India.  And if that&rsquo;s &#8220;racist,&#8221; well, TOUGH.</p>

		<p><i>&lsquo;How can the British Government deny me the right to live with my wife at this late stage of my life because I am unable to speak the language?&rsquo; asked Mr Chapti</i></p>
<p>The only person denying him the right to live with his wife is his wife. She could go live with him anytime she likes.</p>
<p><i>And he claimed that if the challenge is successful, it will set a precedent that will &lsquo;open the gates&rsquo; for other spouses around the world kept apart by the rules introduced as part of the Government&rsquo;s attempts to curb net immigration.</i></p>
<p>Then let us hope the challenge is unsuccessful. These clowns shouldn&rsquo;t even have access to the courts.</p>
<p><i>Later, Mrs Chapti successfully applied for naturalisation as a British citizen, then attempted to &lsquo;send for&rsquo; her husband and youngest child.</i></p>
<p>Someone needs to close that loophole.</p>
<p><i>The case also argues that the language tests for non-EU migrants discriminate on race grounds against migrants from India, Pakistan and the Middle East.</i></p>
<p>I can only hope.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;If I lose, I can take the case to a higher court &mdash; the European Court of Human Rights.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Ah, yes. The unelected court in Brussels. Get a ruling from some foreign court that has managed to hold indigenous Europeans hostage and then the EU can ram millions more foreigners down their throats. I&rsquo;ll bet that was the goal all along. And I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if someone behind the scenes was funding the whole thing, too.</p>

<p>If he actually does go to work where his wife works, he will be taking a job away from a natural-born Englishman. If he doesn&rsquo;t work, he will be on the dole, paid for by English taxpayers. Either way, he will not be an asset to England, and had best stay home.</p>

		<p>This is the same sob story we hear from Mexicans in the U.S.  If he wants to be with his wife so bad, she can go back to India.  At 57, the real reason he wants to go to England is the free health care.  </p>

<p>Exactly. The British too have lost their sovereignty, at least part of it or perhaps mostly in whole, to the EU and the devil in the process. It USED to be that the Law Lords and parliament were the final say with regard to law in England. NOT NOW! But the English do have that welfare state now and we Americans are just so envious. The &#8220;Law Lords&#8221;. Well, they probably like the welfare state too!</p>

<p>Now THAT explains it. No Hindu Gujarati would be foolish enough to not learn English and suffer a social and business handicap because of it. Gujaratis are a very enterprising community and the first thing their ex-pats do is learn the local language so that they can set up businesses in the local community.</p>
<p>In the US, almost all the Patels who own motels are Gujarati.</p>

		<p>Let me guess. MRS Chapti has been living comfortably in England for years on welfare provided by working white taxpaying racists. Now,impressed by what He&rsquo;s seen, MR Chapti wants to join the British welfare gravy train as well. Not only should they not let this loser in. They should boot HER welfare-grubbing butt out as well.</p>

		<p>These immigrants to Western nations don&rsquo;t consider our laws as binding on them.  Who taught them to yell racism?  India and its caste system that still exists are far more racist.  They use our own laws, sympathies, culture and civilization against us.  How is there a &#8220;right&#8221; to go to another country against the rules of that country?</p>

<p>And almost all of them are fraudsters, one way or another. The first thing they do is lower the quality of these motels. It was these motel owning Patels who tried to rip off victims of Katrina [?] and were fined heavily. Anyway I agree with your assessment regarding reasons for this fellows intransigence &amp; pointless allegations - He&rsquo;s a Muslim.</p>

		<p>I am surprised that our friend Sureesh has not commented on this thread.  No doubt he agrees that all 1.2 billion Indians   &mdash;   hard workers and so, so smart!   &mdash;   should be allowed to immigrate to Western countries where they can get good educations in schools built by whites, and start new businesses funded by the Small Business Administration, and get Affirmative Action jobs at various government agencies because they have dark skin.  </p>

<p>YES! That is the truth. EVERY motel is now owned by these people and they are all filthy and run down. They charge high rates and do nothing to improve those motels. Even when traveling in Idaho from Mexifornia, I was shocked that every motel was run by these people, even in Idaho! They ignore you when you request something from them. You can&rsquo;t understand their &#8220;english&#8221;. I was so glad to get HOME!</p>

<p>So, out of a family of nine, eight of you still live in India, and their idea to re-unite the family is to sue the British government and move the other eight to Britain?  Why doesn&rsquo;t the wife just move back?  That way, not only does the family win, but so do the British people.</p>

		<p>Many of the Gujarati Indians (Patel, Shah, Mehta, Modi are last names associated with Gujaratis) I know claim that their religion, primarily Hinduism though their are some muslims like Chapti, and their culture are far superior to White Christianity and culture. Gujarati Indians think that they are far more intelligent than white people. I always have to remind them that their people are the ones trying to immigrate to White nations. No white person wants to immigrate to India or Gujarat.</p>
<p>Gujarati Indians, such as Patels, need to show respect to White people and our culture. They need to fix their own country or at least Gujarat and stop trying to invade our nations!</p>
