<h1>Xbox Addict &#8216;Dies from Blood Clot&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, July 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The family of a budding computer programmer have on Saturday launched a campaign to raise awareness about the health risks of playing online computer games after their son died following a marathon session on his Xbox.</p>
<p>A post-mortem revealed that 20-year-old Chris Staniforth  &mdash;  who was offered a place to study Game Design at Leicester University  &mdash;  was killed by a pulmonary embolism, which can occur if someone sits in the same position for several hours.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Staniforth&rsquo;s distraught father said his son would spend up to 12 hours playing on his Xbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got sucked in playing Halo online against people from all over the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reports of gamers collapsing after spending 15 hours in front of video games are fairly common throughout Asia.</p>
<p>In 2005, a South Korean gamer died after playing online games for three days without taking a break.</p>

		<p>Does the inclusion of this article show that whites are matching Asians in video game enthusiasm?  Including this one really seems out of place.</p>

		<p>Considering Asians&rsquo; low levels of testosterone and the extent of internet/gaming addiction among them, White addicts likely suffer from low testosterone as well</p>

<p>Well, guess what? These whites and Asians spending so many hours playing video games are equally stupid. </p>

		<p>Sexual degeneracy and addiction are the curses of high IQ. Idiots clearly have a more natural understanding of sex, and can&rsquo;t pay attention long enough to anything to develop an addiction.</p>
<p>Video games are the opium that is ruining the best of this generation. Gambling goes back a very long time in Asian culture, though, but exposure to modern media might just be too much. In the future, it might be seen as similar to the American Indian&rsquo;s experience with alcohol.</p>

		<p>Not a big suprise here.  I recall one of the reporters covering our invasion of Iraq dying of a pulmonary embolism for the same basic reason; he had been sitting in the same position in a vehicle for days on end, keeping up with the army&rsquo;s advance.</p>
<p>While interactive gaming is certainly an improvement over television - a totally passive form of entertainment - there are obviously more productive and healthier things to do with one&rsquo;s time, especially when the weather is nice.  Why on earth was this guy playing games 12 hours a day during the summer?  The exercise or lack thereof one gets when young will affect one&rsquo;s health for a lifetime; you&rsquo;ll either develop a good reserve of cardio-pulmonary strength, or you won&rsquo;t - as studies done on identical twins have shown.</p>

<p>And so the Japanese phenomenon of the &#8220;Otaku&rsquo;   &mdash;   obsessed (and usually virginal) computer nerds so addicted to the Internet that they never leave the house   &mdash;   goes West. </p>
<p>I loved every Toyota, Honda and Nissan I&rsquo;ve ever owned, but this is one Japanese import I can do without. </p>

		<p>I tried a few cigarettes but did not bother ever again, I do enjoy playing computer games like a little five year old kid every now and then, but I am not addicted (maybe my IQ is not very high) </p>
<p>but anyways there is no excuse ever, and nobody else to blame, if some people suffer death caused by video game addictions.  I do feel sorry for the Korean gamer but he has no one else to blame.  </p>
<p>I just can&rsquo;t do anything consecutively for two or three days in a row.  I am sure I won&rsquo;t die, ever, because of playing games excessively.  </p>
<p>Gambling&hellip;. I majored computer science web development while I was doing my undergraduate and I learned how to program those gambling slot machines&hellip;. and here is a fact that I am not really supposed to tell anyone but, the slot machines are programmed in the way that whoever plays the game can never win.  The slot machines are programmed in the way that it will always make people lose money.  (Imagine what will happen if the slot machines ever let people win money over and over again) If you ever want to play slot machines, then you are welcome to go ahead, but please remember to play the slot machines for fun, without any expectation to make money out of the slot machines.  As for the type of gambling that does not involve any machinery&hellip;. then that is a different issue that I have nothing to say about.  </p>
<p>And lastly, not being able to focus on one specific subject for an extended period of time, might actually mean that that person is very creative and his extreme creativity is the direct factor that is preventing the person from focusing on one specific subject&hellip;.  his or her brain is designed in the way that it constantly wants to learn, or deal with, different or brand new subjects after a period of time.  His or her brain just cannot stand dealing with the same thing over and over again.  His or her brain will feel stressful if it is ever forced to do the same thing over and over again.  But that is not necessarily a constantly positive thing either because there are times in our lives when we do need to focus on a specific subject for a while.</p>
<p>One last thing I noticed about the connection between me and computer games&hellip;.  I am extremely untalented.  I always lose to the Chinese boys.  I am often bewildered, saying, &#8220;How did that Chinese guy just do that?&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Sounds like a similar situation with the dangers of long plane flights. I myself had a run in with Deep Vein Thrombosis on a trip to Australia years ago. I&rsquo;m tall and my legs were cramped up, difficult to get up and out past other passengers (I was in the window seat), and as I had been awake for over 24 hours straight already, I slept for most of a long leg of the trip. Big mistake. I was quite lucky that it didn&rsquo;t end badly.</p>
<p>All subsequent flights, I get up every couple of hours to walk about the cabin. Even if its an overnight trip. </p>

		<p>I have a trick for that on long plane flights, Denny J.  Between the US and Sydney, Australia, I always flew All Nippon Air (via Japan.)  The price was the same as a direct flight, but with an overnight stop at Narita (the airfare included the hotel and meals).  This broke up the trip into two shorter, more tolerable parts.  In addition, the agents at the ANA counter were extremly nice, and would always ask me if I wanted an emergency escape aisle seat - because I&rsquo;m fairly tall.  The extra legroom helped.</p>
<p>Back in those days (late 1990s) All Nippon Air was a Japanese domestic airline new to international flights, so they were eager to make a good reputation for themselves; service was excellent.  That may not be the case today, but with terrorism now a consideration, it is fair to ask what Islamic group would attack a Japanese target.  The Japanese Red Army used to do that, but those tended to be hostage-for-ransom or hostage-for-inmate release situations in which none of the airliner passengers were hurt.</p>
