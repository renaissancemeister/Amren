			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), August 5, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An entire 20-man police force has resigned in a northern Mexican town following a series of attacks that killed the police chief and five officers over the last three months.</p>
<p>The officers&rsquo; desertion on Thursday left the 13,000 people of Ascension without local police services, Chihuahua state chief prosecutor Carlos Manuel Salas said. </p>
<p>The mass walk-out appeared to be in protest to a Tuesday attack by gunmen that killed three of the town&rsquo;s officers, Mr Salas said.</p>
<p>State and federal police have moved in to take over police work.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t the first deadly attack on the police department this year.</p>
<p>In mid-May, police chief Manuel Martinez, who had been in office just seven months, was gunned down with two other officers on a nearby highway.</p>
<p>The three had been kidnapped a day before police found their bodies blasted with bullets in the back seat of a car.</p>
<p>The town&rsquo;s police force was relatively new when the bloody attacks on the officers.</p>
<p>The previous force had been accused by angry residents of helping drug gangs and had been forced to leave.</p>
<p>Furious residents had led authorities to replace the entire force last September after the mob killings of two teenagers who had allegedly kidnapped a girl from a seafood restaurant.</p>
<p>Martinez, with his new police force, had said he wanted to end the kidnappings and extortions that have terrorized the town where people grow green chilli and cotton.</p>
<p>They took drastic measures to try and rid the town of the rife crime.</p>
<p>The new police in Ascension had installed a telescopic camera in the town&rsquo;s plaza that rotated, giving officers at the station the ability to zoom on a site as far as the outskirts of town.</p>
<p>In addition, townspeople helped police dig a broad ditch around the town to try and thwart criminals from escaping on back roads.</p>
<p>Ascension is south west of Ciudad Juarez, the border city across from El Paso, Texas, that is one of Mexico&rsquo;s most violent cities. </p>
<p>The state of Chihuahua has had the most homicides blamed on organized crime and drug trafficking since the government&rsquo;s anti-drug offensive began in December 2006.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Defence Department announced that a 19-day offensive in northern states against the Zetas drug cartel had resulted in the shooting deaths of 30 alleged criminals and a soldier.</p>
<p>The army said that among those killed was Jorge Luis de la Pena, the Zetas boss for Nuevo Laredo, the city across the Rio Grande from Laredo, Texas.</p>
<p>Troops also detained 196 people in different cities during operation &#8216;North Lynx.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zetas gang, known for its viciousness, has been fighting its former ally, the Gulf cartel, in Mexico&rsquo;s north since early 2010.</p>
<p>Near the northern industrial hub of Monterrey, police found the bodies of two men each hanging by an ankle from a pedestrian bridge. Officers said a witness reported that gunmen strung up the men alive and then shot them.</p>
<p>Such grisly displays at bridges have become common in and around Monterrey as well as in other Mexican cities torn by drug violence.</p>

		<p>This article is obviously racist propaganda and full of lies.  </p>
<p>We all know from La Raza that Mexicans are, in reality, hard-working, family-oriented, God-fearing, peaceful, intelligent, and capable people who have built up Mexico into the crown jewel of the North American continent  &mdash;  and they are now working hard to bring the USA up to those same lofty Mexican standards.</p>

		<p>By contrast, a farming town with only 13,000 people in Austria or Wyoming would probably be a very pleasant place in which to live.</p>
