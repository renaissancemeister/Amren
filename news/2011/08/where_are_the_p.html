			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Lovitt, MSNBC, August 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Park system is often called &#8220;America&rsquo;s Best Idea,&#8221; but according to a new report, it remains more like terra incognita for many people of color.</p>
<p>Released Wednesday, &#8220;The National Park System Comprehensive Survey of the American Public,&#8221; conducted by the Wyoming Survey &amp; Analysis Center at the University of Wyoming, is a follow-up to a much-cited report on race/ethnicity among park visitors conducted in 2000.</p>
<p>Taken together, the two surveys show that while the American public has grown increasingly diverse in the last decade, black and Hispanic-Americans remain underrepresented in visits to the 394 National Park Service (NPS) properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite efforts by the National Park Service and its partners to engage underserved populations,&#8221; wrote the researchers, &#8220;visitation differences by race/ethnic group seem not to have changed much over the past decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conducted by telephone in 2009, the survey queried 4,103 respondents across the U.S. The results showed that non-Hispanic whites comprised 78 percent of park visitors in 2008  &mdash;  2009. By comparison, Hispanics accounted for 9 percent of visitors, while African-Americans were 7 percent of visitors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The national parks represent the American story, and there are groups of people who don&rsquo;t identify with that,&#8221; said Carolyn Finney, assistant professor in the College of Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley. &#8220;For some people, there&rsquo;s a sense that the parks are pretty white.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visitation figures are skewed even further when the visits in question are to parks that showcase wilderness and outdoor recreation. For example, at Yosemite National Park in California, a 2009 visitation survey showed that African Americans totaled just 1 percent of visitors, compared to 77 percent white and 11 percent each for Hispanics and Asians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In roughly 40 years, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that non-white minorities will constitute at least half of the American population, up from roughly one-third in 2008.</p>
<p>And, as numbers in the new report reiterate, the impending majority tends to engage less with the national parks than the existing one, for a whole host of reasons, ranging from the obvious  &mdash;  such as cost and accessibility  &mdash;  to more subtle ones dealing with imagery, identity and what constitutes the &#8220;appropriate&#8221; way to experience the parks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In fact, given the ongoing shift in the nation&rsquo;s demographics, the true significance of that ownership has less to do with the parks&rsquo; past than with their future. Equal opportunity is not just a good thing; it&rsquo;s also the key to the parks&rsquo; continued survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the Park Service going to do in 2050 if the potential stewards (such as legislators and the people who vote them into office) have no sense of ownership or connection to the national parks?&#8221; asked [black Yosemite park ranger Shelton] Johnson.</p>
<p>Or, as [black park visitor Audrey] Peterman put it, &#8220;Even if the entire white population was bent on environmental protection, it won&rsquo;t work if the other half of the population is not involved.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This same story surfaces periodically.  Blacks simply do not enjoy being out of the city.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some national parks are increasingly full of Mexicans - planting secret marijuana fields, or running drug operations.</p>

		<p>Illegal Mexicans have apparently made parts of Yosemite unsafe, as they use the park to grow drugs. But there are National parks that are still lovely, including the southern Utah sites such as Zion &amp; Arches. And Acadia in Maine is spectacular &amp; all white. It is a pleasure to walk, hike, or bike in these places and see only courteous white people. No loudmouths, no attitude. A rule of the parks is to &#8220;pack out&#8221;  &mdash;  take your litter &amp; trash with you when you leave. Minorities love to leave as much garbage behind as possible, so they find such rules uncomfortable.</p>

		<p>This story sure is an indictment of blacks in particular.  What constitutes the &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; way to experience the parks?  Put fast food and a mall in the parks, I presume, with rap music blaring across the landscapes.</p>
<p>Blacks are not increasing vis-a-vis whites.  The real story is whether Hispanics care about visiting the very land that they say whites &#8220;stole&#8221; from them, i.e. all the Southwest national parks.  You&rsquo;d think that they would be proud to frequent their &#8220;ancestral homelands&#8221;, and their absence speaks volumes.</p>

		<p>Wyoming is a long way from large black communities, therefore, so as to prevent the Whites who visit the park from remaining unmonitored for Racism and the Happiness of White Privilege, we should tax White Humanity and create a NAACP managed fund to pay the expenses of all blacks who want to visit and do their part in the &#8220;continuing struggle for Civil Rights&#8221;.</p>

		<p>You know, no matter how hard I try, I just don&rsquo;t understand the logic behind these sort of stories! Seriously Why is this an issue?</p>
<p>OK well I do sort of, that our government and media have entirely become a one trick pony. Everything, every issue has to be about race.</p>
<p>So this issue will now eventually generate concern in Washington DC. and soon taxpayers will be footing the bill for minorities to take trips to national parks? Or is this disparity the result of &#8220;do the wilderness be racist?&#8221; &#8220;Sarcasm off&#8221;</p>

		<p>If only one percent of National Park tourists are black, it would explain why the National Parks have stayed so nice! </p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t value things like National Parks. Open land, open space and the majesty of the wilderness are things that are cherished more by White Americans, European tourists, Asians and some Hispanics - but not blacks! </p>
<p>If blacks had their way, they would shut the National Park System down and use the money formerly allocated to it to increase their welfare payments, funding affirmative action programs and things like &#8220;midnight basketball&#8221;. </p>

		<p>It is very important to put a news story such as this in context which I shall now do.</p>
<p>Always remember this: the fundamental issue is race-replacement. MSNBC is viciously and openly promoting race-replacement. MSNBC is owned by GE. GE is the Military Industrial Complex whose racket is making $ from war (death and destruction) and keeping the wages of Native Born White Americans as low as possible..which they do by buying Republican and Democratic Politicians (puppets for GE).</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans pose a very serious problem for GE because they have funny ideas in their heads about having a high wage economy. This enraged former GE CEO Jack Welch to the point that he wrote in his autobiography that he believes in a labor policy of squeezing and squeezing American Labor-&#8220;like a grape&#8221; he writes in his book-to the point of serf-like submission.</p>
<p>So far, so good..everyone is following right along. So here is the problem that GE-the owner of MSNBC-faces:  how does it justify such a criminal and treasonous business practice that 1) threatens the human species and life itself on the planet earth - GE designs and builds nuclear weapons (weapons of mass destruction) - and 2) transfers billions of dollars in wealth away from millions of  Ordinary Native Born White Americans to the White Liberal Corporate Greedy Cheating Class..to guys, such as ..well..Jack Welch? Enter the ideology of the &#8220;blessings of diversity&#8221; . You see Ladies and Gentleman, the ideology of the &#8220;blessings of diversity&#8221; is the &#8220;kind and caring and very humane&#8221; ideological cover for a great crime. A high wage economy for millions of Native Born White Americans would require a complete shutdown of all post-1965 nonwhite immigration to 0&hellip;and the expulsion of the Mexican, Muslim and Asian fifth columns that are now deeply entrenched in our America&hellip;doing this would induce a severe labor scarcity which would drive up the nearly 40 years of stagnant and declining real wages for millions of Native Born White Americans. In fact, if the 1965 Immigration Reform  Act had never been passed, and all nonwhite white legal immigration has been shut down to 0 in 1965&hellip;with very high probability, the real wage would have never have gone done for the past 40 years.</p>
<p>So the low wage labor strategy of GE requires a complete demonization of the Native Born White Majority which as I mentioned previously has funny ideas in its head about having a high, real wage economy. And if you watch MSNBC there is a complete demonization of Conservative Native Born White America. Just look at the new promo-commercials featuring the very nasty transsexual Rachel Maddow who in these promo-commercials is standing in front of some iconic symbol of Americana..Hoover Dam for example..where she lectures us about traditional American values..I mean it&rsquo;s truly bizarre.</p>
<p>This news story about the National Parks being too White is more vicious demonization of Native Born White America by GE (the Military Industrial Complex) which owns MSNBC..along with MSNC co-owner-and  low wage enthusiast and  billionaire-Bill Gates.  What I have written is all you need to know.</p>

		<p>OK, I&rsquo;ve got this figured out. I know a way to get more blacks into National Parks. NO, I don&rsquo;t  mean pay them to come.(Don&rsquo;t have enough money for that anymore.) We need a new national trail, a black-friendly counterpart to the Appalachian Trail or the Pacific Crest Trail. It might be called the &#8220;Black Pride Trail&#8221; or the &#8220;White Shame Trail.&#8221; The trick is to not make the blacks actually walk on the trail - that would remind them of their pre-Cadillac days or even slavery times, so making a black person walk is racist.</p>
<p>Instead let&rsquo;s sign-up a bunch of white volunteers from the Sierra Club (almost all white, btw), who will carry the blacks who come visit the Black Pride Trail in sedan chairs. This will be physically demanding for the whites, but as we all know they are inferior to blacks physically so they need the exercise. As they carry the blacks to various scenic points along the trail, a white tour guide will recall all the terrible things white people have done to black people for the past 500 years, apologize, and then move on to the next scenic stop, where they will continue the process until the white tour guide has finished apologizing for everything bad the racist white man has done.</p>
<p>This should take about 1,000 miles. Then the whites carrying the sedan chair blacks will turn around and take the blacks back to the starting point, stopping along the way on the return journey to praise blacks for inventing things like civilization, the pyramids, boats, airplanes, jazz, Seal Team 6, etc., etc. By journey&rsquo;s end, everyone will feel much better about themselves, and blacks will have had an authentically &#8220;black&#8221; national park / outdoor experience.</p>
<p>I realize the wear and tear on the whites carrying the blacks will be pretty high. But actually it should be even higher to make it a truly righteous experience for all. So let&rsquo;s add some &#8220;stations of the cross&#8221; type flagellation of the sedan chair bearers at each stop to increase the moral goodness of the exercise, which should really attract more blacks to our national parks.</p>

		<p>One of the first reasons that blacks here in California do not go camping,rafting, hiking in our parks is because they don&rsquo;t know where they are in the first place. The Feds will have to bus them there because they have a right to enjoy nature also. </p>
<p>Once they get there,they&rsquo;ll just see  what they&rsquo;ve been missing, whites to rob, rape, kill, there a reason why you can now carry a weapon in a national park, to protect your family and self.</p>

<p> And what pray tell will make them &#8220;sense&#8221; the parks are more brown? Throw up a few dozen 7 elevens for them to flash rob? Put a drug dealer behind every other tree? Invite rival gangs for an annual shoot out?</p>

<p>Meaning that Whites will soon be extinct in this country. As for &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; the only thing blacks and hispanics understand that to be is only when they get something from Whitey that is free and comes in the form of money.</p>
<p>I hope they NEVER start visiting the Parks! It is the only place left in America that is still segregated. I don&rsquo;t want to camp or hike in the parks or mountains among blacks and browns. We know our lives would surely be in danger. Isn&rsquo;t it bad enough that they have taken over all community parks to where Whites cannot even go any longer. </p>
<p>I am so sick of this push for diversity in every area of American life. White life, that is.</p>

		<p>Blacks like things loud. Loud talking. Loud laughing. Loud yelling. Loud hootin&rsquo; &#8216;n&rsquo; hollerin&rsquo;. The louder the better.</p>
<p>Blacks aren&rsquo;t attracted to the solitude and silence of nature. </p>
<p>Bringing blacks to a national park would be like blacks moving in anywhere. They would bring their obnoxious loudness with them, turn it into the hole they left, and drive whites away.</p>
<p>The environment best suited to the black man is the urban jungle as it provides a mix of both; urban and jungle.<br>

		<p>The American nature writer and environmentalist and a man I respect quite a bit, Edward Abbey wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be wise for us, as American citizens, to consider calling a halt to the mass influx of even more millions of hungry, ignorant, unskilled, and culturally-morally-genetically, impoverished people&hellip;Why not [support immigration]? Because we prefer democratic government, for one thing; because we still hope for an open, spacious, uncrowded, and beautiful  &mdash;  yes beautiful!  &mdash;  society, for another. The alternative, in the squalor, cruelty and corruption of Latin America, is plain for all to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, Abbey&rsquo;s racial musings have been largely dismissed by the liberal elite as a personal shortcoming at best, and vile racism at worst.  Abbey will likely be proven 100% correct long before the mid-point of the century, but by then luxuries like the National Parks will hardly matter to most Americans, with so many people shouting and pointing fingers at one-another that we&rsquo;ll scarcely be able to make who supported this multi-culturalism experiment in the first place.   </p>
<p>Sure, equal-opportunity, outreach programs, field-trips for inner city youth; those are the keys to preserving the National Parks problem for posterity.  That sort of thing is certain to succeed at encouraging inner-city Blacks and Latinos to develop the same tastes, proclivities, and appreciations as Whites, just as it has worked so well before.</p>

		<p>The two Whitest places I&rsquo;ve been this year have been the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, and a U2 concert in St Louis, Missouri. Both of those had at least 99.1% observed white attendance. Although there were some blacks from Tennessee, Georgia, and Kentucky in the resort we stayed in in Sevierville, Tennessee, the surrounding areas of Gattlinburg, and Pigeon Forge were almost as absent of blacks as the National Park. I didn&rsquo;t go to Dolly World, but I am betting that would be a pretty good pick as well for a vacation. </p>
<p>The culture divide of where America vacations is even wider than just National Parks.  </p>

		<p>There is one activity that blacks are great at: complaining. If blacks wanted to spend time in national parks, and blacks thought that something prevented them, blacks would complain loud and long. Blacks have no problem, why are the liberals trying to create one?</p>
<p>When the &#8220;minorities&#8221; take over the US, national parks will be developed or destroyed, depending on which minorities are in control. </p>

		<p>Years ago when I listened to Pacifica Radio I noticed something: when there was a protest march and very few whites showed up the radio hosts would rip into whites for being a no-show.</p>
<p>Then when there was a protest march and only whites showed up the hosts would then rip into whites- for not doing enough &#8220;outreach&#8221; to &#8220;people of color&#8221; so that they would attend.  </p>
<p>So before I read the article I just knew there would be no criticism of blacks for ignoring our national parks; instead there would be lots of soul-searching about what&rsquo;s keeping these wonderful people away.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons I enjoy visiting our national parks is because I do not have to endure the endless ghettoization of said parks. No loud rap, ranchero or graffiti to contend with.  No mothers pushing strollers with their anchor spawn in tow. Here in CA, it&rsquo;s impossible to go to a local park on a national holiday. The illegal invaders from Mexico have already seized those for themselves. </p>
<p>Honestly, is there anything left that we whites will be able to keep for ourselves without the multiculturalists and diversity hawks taking it from us?</p>
<p>For goodness sakes!<br>

		<p>It would appear as if YSNP is wallowing in a diversity-free buffer zone, with the nearest bastions of blessed diversity being Salt Lake City (give or take 350 miles), Denver (600), Spokane (450), and Calgary (call it 500). In the Pacific Northwest, even those major regional hubs are still predominantly white.</p>
<p>YSNP&rsquo;s remoteness, and the fact that most blacks seem to prefer vacations spent either at home (free, and you know where the liquor store is) or in chintzy places like Las Vegas or Miami Beach (subsidized flights, vice), each seem to contribute the the demographics of park attendees.</p>
<p>As George Constanza once said, &#8220;I&rsquo;m BASKIN&rsquo; IN THE BUFFER BABY!&#8221;</p>

		<p>White Americans are the descendents of pioneers and settlers.  Experiencing the wide open spaces is in our DNA.  Blacks and Hispanics have no such experience.  Being in an isolated natural area is symbolic of being independent and self-reliant.  Blacks and Hispanics are the least self-reliant people on the planet.  </p>

		<p>Another almost black-free place is any museum devoted to anything not African or black.  I recently went to the Huntington in Pasadena and the Art Institute of Chicago.  </p>
<p>There were thousands of people at the Huntington and it suddenly occurred to me that I had not seen any blacks there.  So I started counting.  Out of a very large crowd spread out over large gardens, a conservatory, indoor sculpture and painting galleries I saw three blacks.  I don&rsquo;t remember seeing any at the Art Institute aside from the lady who sold me a ticket.</p>

		<p>Not enough blacks in American parks?? That must be rectified immediately. I would suggest taxing White&rsquo;s even more than they already are and using these funds to attract blacks to state and national parks. Perhaps hip hop festivals or other activities that attract blacks could be scheduled in these parks. That would increase diversity and multiculturalism in parks and everyone then wins.

		<p>This article/report seems to be some sort of official admission that White Americans will be the minority in their own country by 2050.</p>
<p>The report also suggests that National Parks will not be a priority when the US is Black/Hispanic.</p>
<p>When I visit a national park I like to know that the only fellow hikers that I meet will be people who are there to enjoy the great outdoors. I would hate to meet up with park visitors (of any colour) who had been bused in and were totally bored, looking for or wanting to cause trouble and would rather be back home playng video games or be in a skate board park.</p>
<p>Can the PC do-gooders please leave our national parks alone!</p>
<p>PS Some nature reserves here are in the hands of indigenous &#8220;Traditional Owners&#8221;. On more than one occasion and in an act of total hypocricy  they have wanted to sell these lands to property developers!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The national parks represent the American story, and there are groups of people who don&rsquo;t identify with that,&rdquo; said Carolyn Finney, assistant professor in the College of Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley. &ldquo;For some people, there&rsquo;s a sense that the parks are pretty white.&rdquo;<br>
This is a specious comment.  Of course there are groups that don&rsquo;t identify with parks, and the parks are pretty white.  But so what.  The parks are open to all, and the incidents of white-on-black crime non-existent.  This is not about fear or being welcome, its about personal preferences.   One could ask is it blacks don&rsquo;t like whites or things that whites like?</p>

		<p>Just so happens that Carolynn Finney is&hellip;black. And she is another black who is cheerleading the race-replacement of the Native Born White Americans Majority at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. What Finney is clearly stating is that environmentalism-ecology requires racially cleansing America of the Native Born White American Majority.</p>
<p>Carolynn Finney is another fake enivornmentlaist. She is an enthusiastic supporter of post-1965 legal immigration policy which floods our American with thousasnds of high-fetility post-1965 nonwhites who are a massive force of overpopulation. Post-1965 nonwhite generated population growth is massive force of environmental and ecolgical detruction within the borders of America. And quite frankly, we may have reached the point where it is irreversible&hellip;until the point of complete ecological collapse. Chinese and Korean legal immigrants have introduced various subspieces of the Asian snakehead fish into rivers in Virginia setting into motion large-scale ecocide in the riparian ecosystems of Vrginia.</p>
<p>Keep this on mind, the last thing in the world that Carolynn Finney would want to see is Native Born White American fertility  increase to four -five per Native Born White American Women. Because if this ever happend, it would throw a monkey wrench into her plans for race-replacing the Native Born American Majority..big time.  So, since Carolynn Finney is so obvioulsy a fake environmentalist and a black racist&hellip;ask her if she would be happy to see a large increase in Native Born White America fertility.</p>
<p>If nonwhites started to flood into the great National and State Parks, millions of Native Born White Americans will finally learn the hard way that there are no more safety valves to which they can run away to and flee from post-1965 nonwhites and blacks&hellip;then the process of reclaiming Native Born White Ameican living space will commence.</p>
<p>If aything is obviously true it is this:posst-1965 nonwhites re the number one threat to Ameeica&rsquo;s great National and State Parks.</p>

		<p>The article states that 7% of visitors to parks overall are black.  Given that blacks are less than 13% of the population, that seems reasonable.  A huge proportion of blacks live in large cities, and, after living and working in two of these for over a dozen years, I&rsquo;ve found that most blacks don&rsquo;t like getting out of municipal areas.  They&rsquo;re afraid of rural whites, of being away from other blacks, of dogs, etc.  Many travel long distances on buses, where they&rsquo;re securely around other blacks.  <br>
Most blacks are happiest in a black world.  It&rsquo;s liberal whites who try to force them into the white world.</p>

		<p>Thank God there&rsquo;s &#8216;stuff black people don&rsquo;t like&rsquo;. Such as our national parks. The things blacks don&rsquo;t like about them are pages long. Just a sample might be:</p>
<p>Actually moving your body in the act of walking. No air conditioning. No electric plug-ins for charging your cell phone and video games. No large groups of other blacks. Nothing blitzing, flashing and jumping across a video screen. Actually having to plan ahead and organize and pack what to bring, what you&rsquo;ll need and how to bring it - oh my God, how does one DO that? ((e.g., Katrina). What to do when you get there, and how do you know when you actually ARE &#8216;there&rsquo;. After all, what IS &#8216;there&rsquo; - and  how will you know when you find &#8216;it&rsquo;?  No ATM&rsquo;s. What&rsquo;s interesting about a waterfall? There are bugs, wild animals and their noises. No convenience stores selling beer. Lots of whites.</p>
<p>The mind boggles. This would be a massive, foreign undertaking for a group of people even though they had jungle living in their genes. There is absolutely nothing about nature that appeals to blacks. Thank God.</p>

		<p>The principle reason that blacks do not camp or enjoy the great outdoors is that they are deathly afraid of the dark and the animals (real and imaginary) that dwell in it. Along with their bodies-of-water avoidance, these instincts were life-sustaining in deepest, darkest Africa. You can take the African out the jungle, but you cannot take the jungle our of the African&hellip;ever. </p>

		<p>How could the authors and most of you cement heads get it so wrong. It has nothing to do with blacks liking rap or their personal short commings. It is pure tradition. My great great grand father fought in the Corn Field at Antitum and in front of the entrenchments at Cold Harbor. My great grand father took my grand father by train to Richmond so he could view the battlefieds; my grand father took my father to the same places; do you suppose there is a power on Earth that would keep me from being with my son when he walks the corn field with my grand son? Since Yankee liberals have destroyed the black family there are few legacies passed down. You would think that Ft. Wagner South Carolina would be a sacred place for African Americans. Last year less than 20,000 black people visited it even though there is a mass grave where 500 black heroes were buried with their white commander. 160,000 black men fought against slavery and 65 thousand were killed or wounded,4 times the white rate. Since no black kid knows who from his family line were among them,why would they visit their battlefields. Most who tour the parks are rvers. Since blacks are not living in intact familes they won`t be found crammed into a Road Trek with their mommy,daddy and dog.I can trace my roots back to 12th century Scotland.I can do this because we all venerated the folks who were before us and we live to honor them so we in turn will be honored by our children`s children. I can`t concieve what it must be like to not have 13 generations of grand fathers looking over my shoulder and telling me to behave with class and guts.<br>

		<p>One of our major activities for family outings is to visit the Indiana State Parks. Almost all of them are in rural areas with little to no black populations. Once you leave Indy, Fort Wayne and Gary, there are very few minorities in the sticks (yes, I know there are way too many illegals in some areas.) While I have no desire to sleep out in the woods, it is great to go hiking, boating, etc. From time to time, I take my kids to the (Indianapolis) Indians (AAA baseball) game. The crowds are 95+% white. As much as possible, we gear our activities to minimize contact with blacks. They haven&rsquo;t started flash mobs at state and national parks, yet! </p>

		<p>Who needs blacks in national parks? Do we really want tagged trees, white hiker beatdowns and muggings, trash everywhere, hootin&rsquo; an&rsquo; hollerin&rsquo; ruining nature&rsquo;s beauty and solitude? I think not. They have no appreciation or respect for the natural world. Better to keep them confined in da hoods&hellip;.</p>

<p>I think your plan will work.  I would add one thing to the itinerary:  A stop at the Yosemite Village store where a team of volunteers can insert sandwiches into the mouths of the visitors, while a Parks Services &#8220;Mastication Team&#8221; moves the visitors&rsquo; jaws up-and-down and massages the neck to facilitate chewing and swallowing.</p>

		<p>For blacks to thoroughly enjoy the National Parks, a welfare camp must be set up at the entrance for blacks only.</p>
<p>This will provide them with their food, camping items, and general things needed to enjoy the experience. The park would also have all other racial groups and animals cordoned off to another section of the Park, so as to ward off any negative feelings or offences that may be occurred by blacks.  All they would have to do is show up, and be reimbursed gas money, naturally, lest it be considered racist.</p>
<p>This is obviously sarcasm, but watch it happen. </p>

<p> Calolynn Finney and others of her ilk (i.e.,blacks) will be the first ones ethnically cleansed through violence by those high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already happening in California because Hispanics, Asians and those from the Middle East despise blacks, won&rsquo;t hire them and want them out of their children&rsquo;s schools.  They are impervious to black whining and crying about past injustices or historical grievances..  They won&rsquo;t stand for black wilding around their businesses and families and will meet black violence with twice the violence.  Blacks will be denied free housing, food and medical care by their new masters.</p>
<p>People of color in the National Parks?  Sure they are, setting out of control wildfires.<br>

		<p>Blacks have a heightened sense of fear of nature.  You&rsquo;ll hear black comics making statements such as &#8220;white people are crazy wanting to get near the lions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disregard the issue that blacks don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;travel&#8221; long distances to visit these parks.  They also avoid the beaches in their own cities, such as my home town in San Diego.  Blacks will congregate in the grass or parking lot adjacent to the beach, but never set foot on the sand or in the water.  They would rather hang out at the basketball courts near the beach with a heavy police presence, than on beach.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Visitation figures are skewed even further when the visits in question are to parks that showcase wilderness and outdoor recreation. For example, at Yosemite National Park in California, a 2009 visitation survey showed that African Americans totaled just 1 percent of visitors, compared to 77 percent white and 11 percent each for Hispanics and Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, it is a black problem and not a &#8220;people of color&#8221; problem. Asians and Hispanics are well represented.</p>

		<p>Hey, let&rsquo;s be realistic here.   The #1 reason that I like to camp and enjoy the outdoors and National Parks is because that is one of the only places or activities that I can go or engage in where I am almost 100 percent guaranteed not to see any non-whites.</p>
<p>I told a friend of mine once, who likes to hike the Grand Canyon every year - that when, and if, the day comes where what used to be called &#8216;America&rsquo; was being run by a majority of blacks and mestizos, the Grand Canyon he loved so much would be filled to the rim with discarded KFC chicken bones and empty cans of Mexican beer.</p>
<p>Get real.  The only race of people on this planet that gives two cents about the environment and nature are White Europeans.</p>
<p>Excepting those white morons who used to sit on trains crossing the frontier and shoot buffalo out of the windows, who&rsquo;d rot where they dropped and not feed anyone.    My father taught me as a hunter - never shoot any game that you aren&rsquo;t going to eat, and that&rsquo;s the rule that all whites should abide by.</p>

<p>The article stated that people of color  overall were underrepresented in visit to the park since they accounted for 22 percent of the visitors in 2009 (but about 35 percent of the population). Asian visitors likely were not underrepresented since black and Hispanic were 17 percent of the visitors in 2009, thus the remaining five percent were Asians or Native Americans similar to their share of the US population.<br>

		<p>A few years back I went to a nearby state park during a holiday.  This wasn&rsquo;t a vast wilderness like our national parks, but it was a pleasant mixture of woods and lawns and a good place to have a picnic.</p>
<p>Except&hellip; Plenty of blacks had discovered this park, and were picnicking with their families.  What&rsquo;s wrong with that?  Well, every one had a boom box as was playing the loud thumping music that black people like.  When white people have a picnic they don&rsquo;t find it necessary to be accompanied by obnoxious noise.</p>
<p>So I sure hope that blacks continue to stay away from our national parks.<br>

		<p>Eventually, when America becomes overwhelmingly non-White, the National Parks should be appropriated by Whites as the new United White States of America.  Since non-Whites really have no interest in the park system, what loss would it be to them?  </p>
<p>In fact, they&rsquo;d have a lot more money to spend on their welfare system if they don&rsquo;t have to maintain the parks anymore.  Whites, of course, would be happy because they&rsquo;d be safely tucked away in regions of the country that are not easily accessible via the subway, city buses, and taxis.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t anyone remember when Oprah and her sidekick went to Yosemite to encourage more blacks to visit the park and camp out? The one black male park ranger felt so bad that blacks do not frequent the parks. Of course he had to fill everyone in on how it was blacks that has contributed so much to our history and more falsehoods of their heroic deeds. </p>
<p>Oprah and sidekick set up their trailer in a campground with (all White campers) and of course the White campers were thrilled. They all sounded like a bunch of guilty Whites that would welcome more black campers to the park. What a joke. Of course NO White could ever say what they truly felt. It was all staged.</p>

		<p>In the State Parks of the state I live in, this same demographic<br>
is also obvious.  An interesting element of it may be that basic arrangements do not easily incline to Blacks getting a camp site that is near camp sites occupied by other Blacks  &mdash;  unless, of course, a group of Black families makes reservations in advance.<br>
Since most camping is rather improvised (weather, menstrual cycle, family harmony level, payday, etc. ) the odds are slim for a particular Black family having other Blacks in proximity of where they camp.  More basically, of course, Blacks have not evolved from an exploring / hunting / tradition typical of Northern European evolution.  Camping probably taps into a sort of &#8220;racial memory&#8221; of Euro-Americans?   </p>

		<p>I once went camping in a California national park. Most of the vistors were white. There was a significant number of Mexicans and ONE black group. The blacks were a family. They were actually nice and invited us to dinner.  Some of the Mexicans were ok, some left trash. The whites were mostly ok, but some of them were rowdy biker types and through lit cigarettes into the virgin forest. Mostly white is better, but not all whites are perfect.</p>
