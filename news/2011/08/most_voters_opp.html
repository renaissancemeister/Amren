<p class="articleSource">Rasmussen, August 23, 2011</p>

<p>{snip} But a majority of voters remain opposed to giving the children of illegal immigrants the same educational opportunities as those who are here legally.</p>
<p>The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that only 32% of Likely U.S. Voters believe children of parents in this country illegally should be allowed to attend public school here. Fifty-three percent (53%) do not believe those young illegal immigrants should be allowed to attend public school. Fifteen percent (15%) are undecided. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy-two percent (72%) of voters believe parents should be required to prove they are legal residents of the United States when registering their child for public school. Twenty-one percent (21%) oppose such a requirement.</p>
<p>Several states have made illegal immigrants eligible for lower in-state tuition at colleges and universities, but 81% of voters oppose such a move in their state. Just 12% think illegal immigrants should be eligible for these tuition breaks in their home state. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some states also have authorized the issuance of driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal immigrants. Just 18% of voters believe illegal immigrants should be allowed to obtain U.S. driver&rsquo;s licenses. Seventy-four percent (74%) are opposed to driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegals. {snip}</p>
<p>Tea Party voters are more strongly opposed than non-members to any beneficial moves on behalf of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Only 32% of voters now believe a child born in this country to an illegal immigrant should automatically become a U.S. citizen, as is the current practice. That&rsquo;s generally consistent with findings since April 2006.</p>
<p>Sixty-seven percent (67%) think a state should have the right to enforce immigration laws if it believes the federal government is not enforcing them. {snip}</p>
