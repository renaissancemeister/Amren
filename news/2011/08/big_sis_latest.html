	                	<p>Despite causing controversy last month with a video that portrayed white middle class Americans as the most likely terrorists, the Department of Homeland Security has released yet another PSA that depicts an attempt to bomb a subway station not by Al-Qaeda Muslims, but well-dressed white people.</p>
<p>A new Public Service Announcement entitled &#8216;The Drop Off-If You See Something, Say Something&rsquo; was unveiled by none other than Big Sis herself, Janet Napolitano, on the Homeland Security website today.</p>
<p>The PSA, which will be played on television and radio stations, shows a well dressed attractive white woman exiting a taxi before walking into a subway station. The taxi driver-a white man-then makes a phone call and sets a timer on a device in the trunk of the car. The woman then leaves her bag in the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see something, say something-report suspicious activity to local authorities,&#8221; states the voiceover as the clip ends with other commuters reporting the incident to a black security guard and a black police officer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As we highlighted last month, a longer PSA recently produced by the DHS overwhelmingly went to significant lengths to portray white Americans as the most likely terrorists, despite the fact that the 126 people who were indicted on terrorist-related charges in the United States over the last two years were all Muslim.</p>
<p>Bizarrely, the majority of the people shown reporting suspicious activity to authorities were portrayed as non-whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite the DHS&rsquo; claims to the contrary, many saw the ad as being deliberately racially motivated. Some concluded that this was merely a nod to political correctness while others viewed it as part of a pattern of demonizing white middle class Americans-many of whom are furious with the federal government for all manner of different reasons-as the DHS increasingly targets its anti-terror apparatus against politically motivated citizens.</p>
