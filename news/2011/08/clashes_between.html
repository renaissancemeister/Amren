			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least 30 people, including 20 policemen, were injured in the southern Italian city of Bari on Monday in clashes between immigrants seeking asylum and police, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Immigrants angry at delays in getting asylum set fire to trash cans and tires early in the morning, and threw stones at police who intervened to break up the protest, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Some immigrants blocked a railway track, and others blocked traffic on a local highway.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Long-simmering tensions have risen to the fore in recent years after Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s conservative government cracked down on illegal immmigration and tightened procedures for obtaining legal residence in the country.</p>

		<p>Out of 30 injured people, 20 were Italian cops?? That certainly doesn&rsquo;t square up with the contemporary narrative that the Italians are fed up with illegal immigration. (especially sub-Saharan Africans and Gypsies) I think even the police force in Lake Wobegone, Michigan under the leadership of Garrison Keillor would have come out better under a similar scenario.</p>

		<p>Acting up like this in the southern part of Italy can get the attention of a certain group of people who generally act outside of the law but are very effective in getting their message across. Use &#8220;muscle&#8221; to enforce the norms of civil behavior as they see it. &#8220;Muscle&#8221; as wielded in the style of Vito Corleone. Those &#8220;protesters had better watch themselves.</p>

		<p>The sheer arrogance and stupidity of these African invaders is breathtaking.<br>
 The point is, that if you are a stranger seeking hospitality on a stranger&rsquo;s land, you must behave at your best and humblest - not only is this in your self interest, as you need to recommend yourself, it is merely a common courtesy.<br>
 But these African invaders can&rsquo;t even see that.<br>
On the other hand, there is a bonus in that the Italians (some of whom might have beeb naively well-disposed towards the invaders), are now warned as to what the real character and behavior of the invaders is.And believe me what they have just seen is only the merest glimpse.</p>

		<p>Welcome to the new Italy!</p>
<p>From my scratchy Italian I could deduce that the local people were extremely afraid at the situation.If African illegal immigration continues scenes like this will be much more commonplace..the good news is that many Italians are aware of this and looking for their politicians to enforce the necessary laws..certainly this footage<br>
doesn&rsquo;t portray the Africans in a favorable light and will hopefully harden sentiment towards them..it reminds me of the `asylum` seekers here in Australia that keep burning down the centres here in the hope that they will get permanent residency&hellip;the acts of violence they commit can only convince the majority of decent people of shapes of things to come once they gain a stronger foothold a la Camps if the Saints !        </p>

<p>So the invaders are not getting their way quick enough and they behave accordingly! Just what I would want from an invader, proving its worth prior to being given &ldquo;asylum.&rdquo; If that is the preview of coming attractions, God knows what to expect once they are given &ldquo;asylum&rdquo; and realize they haven&rsquo;t been magically turned into Italians; burning homes and cars and thrown statues should be taken for granted at that point, right?</p>
<p>Of course, if the trains just &ldquo;moved&rdquo; the blocking &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; out of the way and the police &ldquo;redirected&rdquo; the rest into the sea, so much diversity would be lost&hellip; </p>
<p>&hellip;.What a pity that!</p>

<p>They should NEVER get asylum whatsoever in any White nation!  I hate that word and I hate the word, refugee. All they mean is forcing their way into any White nation, period. They all need to be deported and go back where they BELONG. WE all need to stop this insanity of allowing these kinds of people in our countries. ENFORCE the borders and shoot to kill. Otherwise, all White and civilized nations will cease to exist and so will the White race that BUILT those nations for themselves and their posterity.</p>

<p>Let me remind you that this has already happened.  In one case, it resulted in murder and an American woman, Amanda Knox, got framed as the murderer.  Didn&rsquo;t we know all along that it was the black West African that did it?  Now there is a retrial set and it is turning out that the prosecutions forensics were completely bogus.  I hope Amanda gets home and helps influence young people to not only be more careful abroad, but NEVER associate with blacks from anywhere.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine is Italian and recently went back to Italy to see family. I asked her if she enjoyed her trip. Se replied that there were blacks everywhere and she did not even recognize her beautiful country. She said she might never go back. I am half-Greek. When we went to Athens many years ago  there  were only Greeks and other Whites  &mdash;  no blacks, no browns. Now there are illegals there too. The Greeks, though, do not take this stuff in their country lightly. </p>

		<p>Notice that all these so-called &#8220;refugees&#8221; are males?  In all the weepy news reports I&rsquo;ve seen of hordes of blacks coming ashore from their leaky boats in the Spanish Canary Islands and now Pantellaria (Italy) and Malta - never a single woman..! Could it be because women daren&rsquo;t get aboard those boats for fear of rape? So with whom do you think these Africans are going to satisfy their sexual urges in Europe?       </p>

<p>That Europe that our ancestors left in some cases generations ago is gone forever.</p>
<p>And the EU is the devil that the various nations of Europe have made a pact with. The EU sends these refugees, what they call them, to all parts of the &#8220;Union&#8221;. So no part of the &#8220;Union&#8221; remains unscathed. Everyone must share in the misery that is being created. So Norway gets some, Lithuania gets some, Greece and Italy get some, Ireland gets some, etc. When you make a pact with the devil to guarantee bank bailouts and a continuation of the welfare state, the devil in due course wants his payment for services rendered. In this case, the devil wants to mix people that should not be mixed. Enjoy before the chaos really gets worse. </p>

		<p>&#8220;How the hell can they be &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221;?? They don&rsquo;t know any political system? They live in the jungle or desert? Words like system and politics are Greek to them&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>These words were from Muammar Qaddafi a few years ago as he agreed on stopping illegal immigrants coming via Libya to Italy (of course not free of charge but it went good). All illegals captured in Italy were sent back to Libya and subsequently to the south from there. It seemed to be working.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://goo.gl/89XFA" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/89XFA</a></p>
<p>Relations between Italy and Libya has become worse due to the ongoing war there (I still don&rsquo;t know why Italy was one of the first European countries to bomb Libya) and Kaddafi seems to have reopened sub-saharan pipelines to Europe. Not very long ago, he threatened Europe to fill it with blacks.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://goo.gl/67TLD" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/67TLD</a></p>
<p>If you noticed, there is not a single Arab-looking guy (let alone the non-existence of women). </p>
<p>By the way, what happened to the &#8220;guido&#8221; type Italians (mentioned in another article on Amren) who kept parts of American cities quite safe? When will Italian people wake up and realize that this is not immigration but an invasion?</p>
<p>Finally: They fight on ITALIAN SOIL against ITALIAN POLICE and injure them although they were even not allowed to set foot on? Wasn&rsquo;t this kinda declaration of war?</p>

		<p>Knowing the Italians, I hardly think these illegal immigrants will get away with this.  Remember, it was Italy that arranged a deal with a hated Muslim dictator (Gadhafi) to stem the flow of illegals into their country.  I suspect Italy will crackdown on immigration even further in the coming months.</p>
