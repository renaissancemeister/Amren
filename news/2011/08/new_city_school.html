Among those values are self-control, respect toward elders and giving back to community.</p><p>The school is the first with an African focus in the St. Louis public school system, a district where about 80 percent of the students are black. {snip}</p><p>{snip}</p><p>But others contend that the African-centered approach is too narrowly focused on one racial group.</p><p>&#8220;I have never had a high regard for any form of ethnic, racial or religious-themed schools,&#8221; said Diane Ravitch, a prominent education historian and author at New York University. &#8220;The purpose of public education is to develop American citizens who are prepared to make their way in the world and to collaborate with others to improve our democracy.&#8221;</p><p>Earlier this year, a few people raised similar concerns at public meetings. They also questioned why the district was opening two schools where girls and boys now attend classes separately-another growing trend in urban education.</p><p>{snip}</p><p>Pamoja-Swahili for &#8220;together&#8221;-is modeled after similar programs in Kansas City, Detroit and Los Angeles, where African-centered schools have been popular and are growing.</p><p>{snip}</p><p>Since the adoption of No Child Left Behind, states and school districts have been under increasing pressure to close the achievement gap between black and white students. {snip}</p><p>&#8220;We say that gap is not an intelligence gap,&#8221; said Kevin Bullard, executive director of the Afrikan Centered Education Collegium Campus in Kansas City, where about 1,200 students in preschool through 12th grade are enrolled in that district&rsquo;s African-centered program. &#8220;Often it&rsquo;s a teacher gap, in terms of teachers being able to address the learning needs of students within those environments.&#8221;</p><p>{snip}</p><p>Students will learn about the contributions that Africans and African-Americans have made in the subject areas they are learning about, from math to science to music to literature.</p><p>{snip}</p><p>&#8220;We want children to learn all that they can to be great and be competitive in this world,&#8221; said Sean Nichols, principal at the school. &#8220;We also want them to understand there are contributions by Africans and African Americans, and that the world is connected.&#8221;</p><p>Students will learn that black history began long before slavery-and that slavery in the United States was just a sliver of the African experience.</p><p>{snip}</p><p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not about race,&#8221; Nichols added. &#8220;It&rsquo;s about culture.&#8221;</p><p>{snip}</p><p>Parent Mika Williams said she was unaware that Cole Elementary had transformed into Pamoja until Monday morning, when she walked her fourth-grade son and sixth-grade daughter into the school. She is excited about the change.</p><p>&#8220;It gives them a chance to see another culture and where they came from,&#8221; she said.</p><!-- #bbinclude "footer.incl" -->
