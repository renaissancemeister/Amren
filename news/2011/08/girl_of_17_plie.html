			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Greenwood and Jaya Narain, Daily Mail (London), August 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A young woman lured two white teenage girls to be raped by three Asian men with the promise of a night out.</p>
<p>Stephanie Knight, then 17, told the pair they were going clubbing but instead plied them with vodka and drugs before forcing them to have sex with &#8216;her boys&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After persuading them into her car she was heard to say &#8216;got them&rsquo; over her mobile phone as they travelled to a derelict house.</p>
<p>The two 16-year-old victims were then subjected to an appalling ordeal in which both were threatened and subjected to vile sex attacks.</p>
<p>The case is the latest featuring Asian sex attackers who preyed on vulnerable young white girls. A damning report published recently revealed one in four men accused of street grooming young girls for sex is Asian.</p>
<p>Politicians and police have repeatedly clashed over how best to tackle what some suspect is a potentially incendiary hidden crime wave.</p>
<p>Jack Straw, former home secretary, has accused some Pakistani men in Britain of seeing white girls as &#8216;easy meat&rsquo; for sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Knight, now aged 19, sobbed as she was convicted of conspiracy to rape at Burnley Crown Court yesterday.</p>
<p>At the time she was in council care and had taken the victims to a supermarket car park where they drank vodka and coke and smoked drugs in December 2009.</p>
<p>One girl later said she was &#8216;feeling smashed&rsquo; and the other said that on a scale of one to ten of drunkenness she rated a ten. </p>
<p>They were then taken to a dark and empty terraced house in Accrington, Lancashire, with no electricity where one of the attackers once lived.</p>
<p>Knight threatened one girl and ordered her to perform a sex act on one man before holding her back as the other girl screamed for help as she was raped nearby.</p>
<p>As the screaming continued, she told the girl her friend would suffer even more if she did not comply and said &#8216;she is chilling with my boys&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The second girl was pulled into a number of rooms by the men who took turns to rape her throughout the night. One man used a wardrobe to barricade her inside.</p>
<p>Both girls were then raped again as one of the men, whose partner was due to give birth at the time, drove them home to Blackburn. He threatened them with a knife.</p>
<p>Three men, brothers Amjad Hussain, 34, and Shahid Hussain, 37, and their cousin father-of-four Tanveer Butt, 39, were all convicted of rape.</p>
<p>The victims had only known Knight for a week and had not met any of their attackers before, the court heard.</p>
<p>Knight, who has been in care since the age of 11, first met Amjad Hussain when he pulled up in his car beside her six months earlier and asked for her number.</p>
<p>They went on to have a sexual relationship and Knight, who said she fell in love with him, also performed sex acts on his brother and cousin.</p>
<p>Following the arrest of the defendants, one of the victims was asked by police what she knew of Knight. She replied: &#8216;She hangs around with a load of Asian lads.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Knight had been left traumatised after witnessing a man being kicked to death three months earlier. </p>
<p>Friends said Asian men would lavish her with attention, pay for her meals and take her for rides in their cars.</p>
<p>One source said she was &#8216;plasticine in their hands&rsquo; and had been living on the streets and sofas for six months before the rapes.</p>
<p>The Hussain brothers, who argued the sex was consensual, shouted that they were innocent as they were led from the dock on their conviction.</p>
<p>Judge Beverley Lunt warned the men they will receive &#8216;long prison sentences&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The report into street grooming was ordered after the ring-leaders of a Derby gang, which subjected a string of vulnerable girls to sex attacks, were jailed earlier this year. </p>
<p>Several police forces have investigations currently going on into gangs suspected of abusing young girls.</p>
<p>It found 2,379 offenders are suspected of attempting to lure vulnerable victims, often using drugs and alcohol, over the past three years. </p>
<p>A disproportionate 28 per cent of them were found to be Asian, in those cases where ethnicity was recorded. The ethnic group makes up just 6 per cent of the UK population.</p>
<p>In the Derby case, a gang of nine men cruised the streets of the town, picking victims who they plied with vodka and cocaine before attacking them.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s Minister Tim Loughton has suggested that closed Asian communities have turned a blind eye to child sex grooming by gangs of men. </p>
<p>He said criminals had escaped detection because of attitudes within their communities as well as political correctness and racial sensitivities of the authorities.</p>
<p>In January, Mr Straw urged the Pakistani community to think about the problem of young men targeting vulnerable young white girls.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;These young men are fizzing and popping with testosterone, they want some outlet for that, but Pakistani-heritage girls are off limits and they are expected to marry a Pakistani girl from Pakistan, typically.</p>
<p>&#8216;So they seek other avenues and see these young women, white girls who are vulnerable, some of them in care, who they think are easy meat.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The Government will publish an action plan in the autumn, detailing how it will respond to concerns about child sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>Amjad Hussain, of Accrington, Shahid Hussain, of Rochdale, and Butt, of Rochdale, were all convicted of rape and other sexual offences. They and Knight will all be sentenced at Preston Crown Court on September 2.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s incendiary, not because Asians are targeting whites for rape but because prosecuting this could be, even covering this in the news could be, well, incendiary. </p>

		<p>I would recommend this to our Canadian cousins and readers, as they have a very large Pakistani community, possibly of similar bent, in the Toronto area.  (Don&rsquo;t know if any of you go up there, but for the past 5-10 years, many of the public areas of the Toronto suburbs seem like the subcontinent.  A number of Liberal politicians are of Pakistani origin, as well.))</p>

		<p>I really wish they wouldn&rsquo;t call these perps just &#8220;Asians.&#8221; Most Americans, when they think of Asians, think of Japanese, Chinese, or Koreans   &mdash;   East or perhaps SE Asians, not Pakis, Indians or other Southern Asians, who are quite different physically, religiously, and culturally from East Asians. </p>
<p>And when they write, &#8220;Pakistani-heritage girls are off limits and they are expected to marry a Pakistani girl from Pakistan&#8221; they&rsquo;re really talking about Muslim women are off limits for pre-marital sex, so go kidnap &amp; rape white women of the formerly Christian UK.</p>
<p>In college, I was friends w/an Iranian guy, super good looking, like a tan Elvis, who dated and fornicated w/nothing but good looking blonds. I asked him which one he&rsquo;d want to marry. He said he, being a good Muslim, could only marry a Muslim virgin. But until then, he&rsquo;d use American women. This was back in 1979. Nothing has changed. Whites, and esp young white women, are still a naive fools. </p>

		<p>The three moslem rapists and their vile little accomplice all look retarded. But they were clever enough to drug and rape two innocent girls so they&rsquo;re clever enough to go to prison. </p>
<p>This is what the Lib/Lab/Con has done to the country. They&rsquo;ve turned the island into a foreign colony for those who hate them and rape their children. Don&rsquo;t forget to vote BNP.</p>

		<p>&hellip; I should add: a couple of years before that, a black manual laborer I knew on the job said &#8220;white women are so stupid they actually believe what you tell them.&#8221; He could have easily been talking about Stephanie Knight. Nothing changes. White fathers and mothers just send their unprotected daughters hundreds or thousands of miles away to college by themselves, and then wonder why so many of them return &#8220;damaged goods.&#8221; Insane!</p>

		<p>The title of this piece is misleading.  These thugs aren&rsquo;t Asian, they are Pakistani and probably Muslims.  Pakistanis and Indians are generally referred to as &#8220;East Asians.&#8221;  Regular Asians traditionally have had a very low crime rate.</p>

		<p>Sadly, this is partially the result of &#8220;White flight&#8221; which leaves a White underclass behined to face &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; alone and without the means to resist. </p>
<p>They have lost moral values since the politically correct culture has already been deconstructed  whatever they may have had in the way of religion and there are few succesfull Whites around to provide a role model.</p>
<p>Any sense of Britishness, pride and history that might provide a framework and moral sense has also been deculturated deliberatly.</p>
<p>What is hideous is that 3 men in their late thirties took advantage of this girl and then used her as bait to lure and rape two more.   Most normal White men of the same age, being of the same race and religious culture would be far more likely to take a patriarchal and protective attitude.   Common Muslim cultural attitudes to the moral inferiority of &#8220;kaffirs&#8221; surely drives such behaviour.  </p>
<p>They simply don&rsquo;t care about us.  Welcome to Britains multicultural dystopia.</p>

		<p>I see what seems like a never-ending series of stories like this, happening all over the world - inside every White European nation, and aside from being angered and repulsed by the animal like behavior of the non-white perpetrators, there is something else that always troubles my mind.</p>
<p>It is this:  Why aren&rsquo;t White females the most hardcore white nationalists?   Why aren&rsquo;t White females the most dedicated, the most committed, the most vocal white nationalists?  And, more importantly, why do White females seem to harbor such a deep-seated, antagonistic, irrational dislike for White men who are White nationalists and race realists - since it is we, and no one else, who are fighting to save our women from having to be subjected to this sort of predatory abuse?</p>

		<p>They get it from their rubbish parents and the local schools &#8216;Diversity is Strength&rsquo; curriculum. My kids have hated me  for drumming these fear facts into them over the years. But it&rsquo;s worked. I only hope they carry on after me. I have grandchildren now and my daughter (tolerant but sensible) has white flighted for the first time. Only on each occasion I have come to pick up the children for her I&rsquo;ve noticed one more of the invader creeping in. Nowhere it seems, nowadays, is far enough to be gone from it entirely, because our govt in England seems to have a covert dispersal policy. In that no towns and cities here must be seemingly too  white   </p>

<p>Luke, I am a White woman and very WN. But I agree with you that far too many White women are fools. The brainwashing against White males has worked. I also have a great dislike of White men who date/marry outside their own race. Seems women go by their &#8220;emotions&#8221; and feel sorry for the underdog. Any nonwhite male in their blind eyes is an &#8220;underdog&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.some of us though are wide awake when it comes to race and will support you WN White males.</p>
<p> I, for one, want to thank all you WN White males. You are the only ones who care about what has happened to the foolish White women. You WN&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t beat around the bush like so many others do and you say what you mean, no matter the consequences in this corrupted anti-White world. Stay strong!</p>

		<p>Poster #5- I see that you use the word &#8220;kaffir&#8221; when speaking of how the Muslims view the Brits. I&rsquo;ve almost always heard that used when speaking of blacks. In South Africa, the Boers refer to the blacks as kaffirs. Maybe it&rsquo;s a regional slang. </p>
<p>I agree that these aren&rsquo;t Asians in any sense I know of. But again, in America for those of Middle Eastern descent, I use the term &#8220;Arab&#8221; or lighter-skinned people as &#8220;Turks&#8221;. At any rate you won&rsquo;t get too confused if you hold up a pic of a guy from China &amp; a guy from Pakistan. They may share a border at K2 in the Himalayas, but that&rsquo;s about all folks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Stogie&#8221; and &#8220;Colorblind&#8221;  In the UK, They are considered Asian. I don&rsquo;t know what they call Japanese, Chinese, etc. to be honest, but whenever I&rsquo;ve heard the term &#8220;Asian&#8221; used from the UK it was Pakis, Bangladeshis, etc. they were speaking of.  </p>

		<p>This sort of thing does take place in Canada, but &#8216;drugs&rsquo; are usually blamed.  </p>
<p>Girls who accept drugs from Middle Eastern men are being primed for sex, but seldom does this ever become news.  In the Middle Eastern/Pakistani/Arab community, white girls who have sex with Arab men are considered to be lower than dirt.  </p>
<p>Arab women especially hold white women in contempt.</p>

		<p>If I were to walk on the ledge of a skyscraper and fall to my death, wouldn&rsquo;t you say I had it coming?</p>
<p>If I were to go for a walk in the worst area of Compton or Harlem and get robbed and possibly killed, wouldn&rsquo;t you say I had it coming?</p>
<p>If I were a tourist who visited a cartel-infested area of Mexico and got kidnapped, wouldn&rsquo;t you say I had it coming?</p>
<p>I do not in the least bit condone the rape and sexual defilement of this girl. I condemn it severely. But if a girl is dating older Muslims from the Third World and something horrific like this happens, she had it coming to herself. She should have known better.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;Asian&#8221; is used differently in America.  In London when they say Asian they are usually talking about Pakistani or Indian.  In America when it says Asian, we think Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc.</p>
<p>Those guys would be described as Middle Eastern in America.</p>

		<p>I only partially blame the girls, the Pakistanis, and multi-culturalism.  In the end, British men are the problem.  These women were foolish, yes, but it is a society&rsquo;s men who are responsible for protecting the women and defending their culture.  British men are AWOL. They are geldings.  They are wimps of the highest magnitude.  THEY should have never allowed multi-culturalism to take over their country. These girls have to have brothers and/or fathers.  Where are they?  What are they going to do about this?  Cry in a corner probably, if that.  </p>

		<p>To those who said these guys look &#8220;slow&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve heard that alot of Pakistanis keep their marriages w/in the blood lines. That is a powder keg of genetic defects and learning disabilities waiting to explode. Not to mention several anti-social character defects and criminal tendencies. Then add to that a fanatical religion of hypocrisy and you end up with the 3rd world dredges of today. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend like I know everything that God expects out of me, but I know that he doesn&rsquo;t want me to &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; &amp; be a pushover like this naive White girl is. She would be called a Hajji-lover over here, but that&rsquo;s what racial indoctrination is all about. I can love my genetic makeup without hating someone else&rsquo;s. Only a liberal moron or corporate global extremist would think otherwise. <br>

<p>This is a story out of the UK. In British English, &#8220;Asian&#8221; unqualified refers not to East/Northeast Asians but to &#8220;south Asians&#8221; (Hindus, Sikhs, Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, and Bangladeshis). Pakistanis are the worst (by far), it seems. </p>
<p>NE Asians in the UK are normally denoted by nationality. </p>

		<p>I have to disagree with #18, &#8220;In the end British men are the problem&#8221;, I don&rsquo;t think western men have abdicated their roles as protectors, it&rsquo;s the women in the past few decades who are asserting their independance. I don&rsquo;t know about the UK, however, in the US 16yrs is the magical number, it is when you get you drivers license. Teen pregnancy rates are good indicators of such independence.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad the article wasn&rsquo;t shy about race.  The terms &#8220;Asian attacker&#8221; and &#8220;white girls&#8221; must have appeared a dozen times.  The overall tone of the article indicates to me an increasingly disgruntled attitude towards immigrants among native Brits.</p>
<p>This sounds like a terrible epidemic to me, and I only hope and pray that the British people will not allow their daughters and sisters to be abused like this any longer.</p>
