<p>Justin Gray, My Fox (Atlanta), August 10, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Anger and frustration from dozens of Clayton County parents who say their children are going hungry after their food stamps were suddenly cut off.</p>
<p>State officials admit that something went wrong down in Clayton County at the office that administers food stamps and Medicaid but they&rsquo;re still not sure what.</p>
<p>Parents say they can&rsquo;t buy food without those food stamps.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no telling my kids we can&rsquo;t eat. I&rsquo;m not taking no. We don&rsquo;t deserve that. Nobody should go hungry here in Georgia,&#8221; said Terry Clark.</p>
<p>State officials say the office was overwhelmed Tuesday with dozens of families facing a similar problem. The food stamps are just not there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me and my kids they haven&rsquo;t ate since this morning. I was supposed to get my food stamps yesterday and I got nothing,&#8221; said a mother.</p>
<p>A state spokesperson says what happened was out of the ordinary and unexpected but she said they don&rsquo;t know yet what went wrong-what was the glitch that lead to this mess?</p>
<p>&#8220;Our budgets have not been increased, they&rsquo;ve been decreased,&#8221; said one official.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement, a state spokesperson says, &#8220;We have both state and county staff working to understand the cause of the problem today. We are working to ensure people receive their food stamps as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
