<p>Dean Nelson, Telegraph (London), August 12, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>The film, &#8220;Aarakshan&#8221; or Reservation, starring Bollywood&rsquo;s biggest star Amithabh Bachchan, has been accused of being &#8220;anti-Dalit&#8221; by groups which represent India&rsquo;s estimated 500 million people of Untouchable and Backward castes.</p>
<p>Despite being approved by India&rsquo;s censors for unrestricted release, it has been banned in Uttar Pradesh, India&rsquo;s most populous state, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. There have also been calls for the film to be banned in Bihar and Maharashtra.</p>
<p>The film touches a raw nerve among India&rsquo;s higher caste middle classes whose children must reach pass rates higher than 90 per cent to win college places, while a 49 per cent quota means &#8220;backward caste&#8221; pupils can secure places on much lower grades.</p>
<p>In the film, a private college principal, played by Amithabh Bachchan, is forced to resign over his support for reservations and is replaced by his high-caste, anti-quota deputy. He establishes a free tuition centre for poor students opposite the college, and the debate on one of India&rsquo;s most divisive issues rages between them.</p>
<p>Low-caste groups have protested at dialogue they regard as offensive and the casting of major Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan as a bright Dalit boy because he is the son of a nabob, an Indian aristocrat, the legendary former cricket captain Tiger Pataudi.</p>
<p>They objected to one scene where an upper caste vice principal tells Mr Khan&rsquo;s character: &#8220;Our kids study day and night and you people get the maximum seats,&#8221; and another where an upper caste student complains: &#8220;Now we have to do their work, we have to polish shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Resentment among higher castes has increased since 2006 when the government increased reservations to 49.5 per cent to include the so-called &#8220;Other Backward Castes.&#8221; It has coincided with increasingly high pass requirements for India&rsquo;s most sought-after universities. In June one Delhi University college demanded pass rates of 100 per cent for the first time.</p>
<p>The attempt to ban the film however has caused outrage throughout India&rsquo;s film industry. Amitabh Bachchan, India&rsquo;s most celebrated actor, said a ban on the film would undermine India&rsquo;s democracy and mean its people were living in &#8220;a most unfortunate fascist conditioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leading Indian film director Jag Mundra said the film had been exploited for political reasons by those who oppose a debate on caste reservations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to ask these people: &#8216;If you loved one was in a hospital and needed a life-saving operation, and you knew the surgeon came in on a reservation, would you want that person to operate? How long do we make people suffer now to right the wrongs of the past?&#8221; he asked.</p>
