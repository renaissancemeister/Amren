			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Murray Williams, IOL News, August 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu has called for a &#8220;wealth tax&#8221; to be imposed on all white South Africans.</p>
<p>The former archbishop of Cape Town and former head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) also called on members of President Jacob Zuma&rsquo;s cabinet to sell their &#8220;expensive cars&#8221;, &#8220;to show you care&#8221; about the poor in South Africa.</p>
<p>Tutu said apartheid had left South Africans riddled with &#8220;self-hate&#8221;, and it was directly to blame for the country&rsquo;s vicious crime rate and road carnage.</p>
<p>He made the calls on Thursday night during a book launch at Stellenbosch University&rsquo;s Institute for Advanced Study.</p>
<p>The book, The Humanist Imperative in South Africa, contains 26 essays by leading academics and public figures and is edited by Professor John de Gruchy.</p>
<p>As guest of honour, Tutu recounted the myriad ways apartheid had dehumanised South Africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apartheid damaged us all; not a single one of us has escaped.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a break from his prepared speech, Tutu said a &#8220;wealth tax&#8221; had been suggested during the TRC process, and had enjoyed support at the time.</p>
<p>Moments earlier, he had told the whites in the conference room: &#8220;You all benefited from apartheid. Your children went to fancy schools, you lived in posh suburbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stressed, however, that this did not mean all whites had supported apartheid.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Cape Argus after his speech, Tutu expanded on his wealth tax call.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were many in the white community who were ready for this (at the time of the TRC process).</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be quite piffling, maybe 1 percent of their stock exchange holdings. It&rsquo;s nothing. But it could have helped &hellip;  maybe building new homes, and that would have been an extraordinary symbol of their readiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether he was again calling for a &#8220;wealth tax&#8221;, Tutu said: &#8220;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>He then laughed: &#8220;What were you doing in there (the conference centre)? Were you listening?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tutu did not say how he wished the tax to be implemented, but said he hoped whites themselves would &#8220;agitate&#8221; for it to be imposed upon them.</p>
<p>Throughout his speech, Tutu cited numerous examples of what he saw as apartheid&rsquo;s impact, which had fundamentally been an &#8220;erosion of self-esteem&#8221; and the advent of &#8220;self-hate&#8221;. He blamed South Africa&rsquo;s high crime rate on this, saying: &#8220;Thus we must not be surprised at the staggering statistics of violent crime, murder, rape.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you suffer from self-hate you project it on to those who look like you and so we have so-called black-on-black violence, where the victim of a hijacking is shot even when she has surrendered her car keys.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another example, Tutu said black South Africans continued to litter as a result of apartheid.</p>
<p>&#8220;The disgrace of littering &hellip;  is not a function of poverty. Our parents were poor but our surroundings were scrupulously clean because apartheid had not yet done its pernicious work.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;work&#8221;, this eventual impact of apartheid&rsquo;s policies, had left black South Africans feeling: &#8220;I am nothing, I am rubbish and so it does not matter that I live among all this rubbish which reflects what I think of myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tutu said another manifestation of the effect of apartheid was the nation&rsquo;s road death rate, which was regularly one of the highest in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We show it how we drive recklessly, inconsiderately, aggressively&hellip; because deep down we are angry and so the appalling carnage on our roads during the holidays&hellip; horrendous statistics we just accept.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are wounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking about the cabinet ministers&rsquo; cars, Tutu challenged them: &#8220;Your handbook permits you to buy very expensive cars and most of you have done so. In the spirit of ubuntu, to show that you care, that you are compassionate, please sell your expensive cars and replace them with slightly less pricey cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your humanity depends upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tutu said he drove a BMW, which aides described as &#8220;a very old three-series&#8221;.</p>

<p>Tutu said South Africa had become notorious for the gap between rich and poor.</p>

		<p>They will tax the productive human assets until there are no more.  Sadly there are many African nations that have already proven that route a mistake.  You can shear a sheep regularly, but you can eat mutton only once. Shameful discrimination and the destruction of a nation.  The wealth of the average person will go down.</p>

  This &ldquo;work&rdquo;, this eventual impact of apartheid&rsquo;s policies</p>
<p>  This guy is insane. An excuse can me made (and blamed on Whites) for any disfunctional behaviour. <br>
 Does he at least recognize there was more proper behaviour by blacks pre-apartheid? Perhaps it was a &#8220;positive good&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Interesting. Tutu has some vague notion that white people should pay over (to whom?) a portion of their wealth because he has self-esteem doubts.  Somehow the rampant, out-of-control violence that permeates South Africa, and perpetrated by youngsters too young to have recalled apartheid is the fault of that system, which created the only functional first-world nation on the entire continent, one that MILLIONS of blacks fled INTO while apartheid was in effect. Even their inability to drive safely is the result of long-ago racism. Huh???  (I&rsquo;m sure the rest of black Africa wishes they had the problem of enough cars and roads to drive dangerously.)  Another so-called black leader looking for excuses for black dysfunction.  This will go on for another 1000 more years, long after the last white has been driven out of SA.</p>

		<p>If every white were taxed of all but the most meager essentials of life, and all of the proceeds were given to blacks, within less than a generation, most of the blacks that are now broke would be so again. Most of the whites who are now well off would likewise be well off again. Change all of the rules, make them even more biased against whites than they are now - same thing! It would make no difference. </p>
<p>The ruling plutocracy here in the U.S. has been trying in a sneaky way to accomplish just that. Result? Blacks are far worse off than they were a generation ago. Saps like Warren Buffet and many others of his ilk are all but calling for open confiscation of white wealth. It isn&rsquo;t working. We are still out-achieving blacks. It will never change. Whites need only to stop feeling guilty about their wealth and start enjoying it. It is not their fault that blacks can&rsquo;t achieve, nor is it their fault that they are successful. To the victor go the spoils! These wealthy, guilt-ridden plutocrats should shut up and enjoy their wealth, or just shut up! They are aiding and abetting the needless destruction of their own race. Human nature and innate ability decide how things get sorted out in the real world. It is only because millions of brave, long-suffering whites came here and made the best of things that the Buffets, Gateses, Soroses, Rockefellers, etc. are able to live high above their fellows  and cast aspersions down on them, that we are even reading the words of the likes of Desmond Tutu today. If it were the reverse, I doubt that a black would give a damn about their poor white &#8220;brothers&#8221;. </p>
<p>White people! Live! Love! Laugh! Breed! Stop listening to these saps and apologists for failure! Enjoy life and take back what you&rsquo;ve earned! You have nothing too feel guilty about! </p>

<p>Yes, because they stupidly thought that if they paid the extortion they would be let off the hook. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. Once you start paying, you go on paying. Once they know they have the power to make you give up your wealth, that you will not fight back, then the real fun begins. One thing I learned a long time ago about black culture: they would much rather scare you into giving them what they want than try and take it from you. If you show some will to fight, they will usually go on and look for the easy target.</p>

		<p>Tutu is just Mugabe with a smiley face. Confiscating the hard earned wealth of whites, to give to thuggish corrupt black politicians will only exacerbate white evacuation from the country. Any revenue from a &#8220;Wealth Tax&#8221; will be more than offset by whites fleeing to greener pastures.</p>

		<p>This is why it is impossible to have a functioning society with blacks. They will always blame others for all their problems.</p>
<p>This buffoon blames whites for the fact that blacks litter and drive recklessly.</p>

<p>Let me see if I understand this.</p>
<p>Under apartheid, black communities were clean. However, post-apartheid black communities are NOW covered in litter because of the pernicious affects of apartheid.</p>

		<p>I never respected Des. Tutu.  Every time I&rsquo;ve heard him speak, I thought to myself, &#8220;People only like him in the West because he has that thick, rolling &#8216;r&rsquo; accent that is so reminiscent of a scottish brogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of substance, he says the PC thing and that&rsquo;s about it.  To propose taxing an entire race to support another race that, in his wrods, is wounded - as a total group - is insulting to blacks and discriminatory to whites.</p>
<p>When will S.A. whites declare independence in the Western half of the country and leave all non-whites behind?</p>

		<p>Only separation of Black and White people can end this.</p>
<p>It begins, in a socialist model of society, with these lower achievers either living ever more off the work of others or requiring mandated jobs through pro-blackracism, which makes them natural socialists and communists btw. Marxists naturally want to immigrate such people for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Or, you end with the genocide of Whites and typical black 3rd world poverty and corruption, as in Haiti, Rhodesia and most of Africa, and now in progress in South Africa. This expands the number of potential emigrants to any remaining 1st world States stupid enough to let them in (not China, Japan or Korea, for sure!). </p>
<p>Therefore, any remaining White nations must urgently scrutinise any groups calling for black and also Moslem immigration as potential traitors.</p>
<p>Or thirdly, you get the &#8220;Portugal effect&#8221;, where the black gene is merged with the White gene to produce a lower IQ nation, perfect sheep for the NWO, the Marxist&rsquo;s &#8220;new man&#8221;, incidentally, or not.</p>

		<p>I agree that Tutu is nothing but a fraud with a religious collar. This gives him the patina of virtuosity and religious nobility (like Jackson, Sharpton) which allows him to get away with endorsing fools and saying the most ridiculous, stupid things. Like Mandela, he can say virtually anything and get away with it. </p>

<p>An ant and a grasshopper lived in the same field. During the summer, the ant works all day and night bringing supplies for the winter and he prepares his home to keep him warm during the cold winter months ahead. Meanwhile the grasshopper hops and sings and eats all the grass he wants and procreates.</p>
<p>Come winter, the grass dies and it is bitterly cold. The ant is well fed and warm in his house, but the grasshopper has not prepared for the winter, so he dies, leaving a whole horde of little grasshoppers without food or shelter. The moral of the story is that one should work hard to ensure that you can take care of yourself.</p>
<p>The South African Version</p>
<p>The first part is the same, but because it happens in South Africa there are a few complications&hellip;</p>
<p>The starving, shivering offspring of the grasshopper demand to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while right next door they are living in terrible conditions, without food or proper clothing. A TV crew shows up and broadcasts footage of the poor grasshoppers, contrasting this footage with the ant, snug in his comfortable home with a pantry full of food. The public is stunned.</p>
<p>How can it be, in this beautiful field, that the poor grasshoppers are allowed to suffer so while the ant lives in the lap of luxury.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, SAGU (South African Grasshopper Union) is formed. They charge the ant with &ldquo;species bias&rdquo;, and claim that the grasshoppers are victims of 30 Million years of green oppression. The stage a protest in front of the ant&rsquo;s house and trash the street. The TV crew interviews them, and they state that if all their demands are not met, they will be forced into a life of crime. Just for practice they loot the TV crew&rsquo;s luggage and Hijack their van.</p>
<p>The TRC (Take and Redistribute Commission) justifies their behaviour by saying that this is a legacy of the ant&rsquo;s discrimination and oppression of the grasshoppers. They demand that the ant apologies to the grasshopper for what they have done, and that he make amends for all the other ants in history that have done the same thing to the grasshoppers. PAGAD (People against Grasshopper Abuse and Distress) state that they are starting a holy war against the ants.</p>
<p>The president appears on the 8 o clock news, and says he will do everything for the grasshoppers that have been denied the prosperity they deserve by those who have benefited unfairly during the summer. The government drafts the EEGAD (Economic Equity for Greens and Disadvantaged) act retrospective to the beginning of the summer. The ant is fined for failing to employ a proportionate number of green insects, and, having nothing left to pay his taxes, his home is confiscated by the government for redistribution.</p>
<p>The story ends as we see a grasshopper finishing off the last of the ants food while the government house he is in (which happens to be the ants old house) crumbles around him because he does not know how to maintain it.</p>
<p>Showing on the TV (which he and a couple of friends stole from another ant) the president is standing before a group of wildly singing and dancing grasshoppers announcing that the new era of &ldquo;equality&rdquo; has dawned on the field.</p>
<p>The ant, meanwhile, is not allowed to work, because he has historically benefited from the field. In his place, ten grasshoppers have been appointed to harvest the grass for the winter, but the grasshoppers only work 2 hours a day and steal half of what they actually harvest.</p>
<p>When winter comes again and not enough food has been harvested they strike and demand an 150% increase in their wages so that they can buy food, which now has to be imported because the grasshoppers are not productive enough to produce enough food locally.</p>
<p>The ant packs his things, and immigrates to another field where he starts a highly successful food company, and becomes a millionaire by selling food to the field where he came from</p>

		<p>Blacks blame others, be it whites, asians or latinos, if the nonblack groups are better off than them.

		<p>No, the blacks in South Africa have a &#8220;vicious&#8221; crime rate because they&rsquo;re black. Nothing more needs to be said. Blacks don&rsquo;t suffer from self-hatred. In fact, blacks may have the most collectively overinflated egos of any race on earth.</p>

		<p>First of all I believe that this shows some sort of severe pathology of this &#8220;respected&#8221; man. First off all how does he explain the severe littering in every African city on the continent. It was only under control in one country in Africa, S.Africa. That is because Blacks were forced to do what Whites told them to do.as far as crime, what about the insane crime rates of Lagos,Nairobi,Dakar,Abidjan,Luanda etc&hellip;Other African hell holes with no history of Apartheid. Blacks appear to be not only dumb but are pathetic in their ability to excuse their own behavior.</p>
<p>Also &#8220;Saps like Warren Buffet and many others of his ilk are all but calling for open confiscation of white wealth&#8221;<br>
No you are dead wrong&#8221; he is pointing out that he pays lower taxes than is hard working secretary&#8221; if you believe that is bad. I really do not believe you want to see the state that most White realists want to see. One where speculators like Buffet are not even allowed to accumulate so much percentage of a nations wealth, while not even doing one honest days work. I can think of some groups (not White) that believe in such a system. Maybe you would like to convert. Or turn on Rush Limbaugh tomorrow morning!<br>

<p>The problem with your theory is that we are then brainwashed into believing the parasitical stock speculator is the higher achiever than the plumber or Engineer.

<p>Because he and Mandela are the best they have got.</p>
<p>The liberals in their desperation to assuage their white guilt and topple white control in Southern Africa clutched at whatever straws came their way.</p>
<p>Let us not forget the British Parliament actually recommended to the Queen that Robert Mugabe become a Knight of the realm and was bestowed the title of Sir Robert Mugabe (subsequently quietly repealed), and a number of UK universities conferred honourary degrees on him.</p>
<p>What goes around comes around.<br>
Black appreciation payback hit the UK big time last week in the form of the riots which began in London<br>
Now what?<br>
It remains to be seen how they will slither out of the self inflicted mess the British have created for themselves.</p>

<p>You may have a point, but Warren Buffett is not a good example.  If he wants to pay more taxes, he should just write a check.  And for good reason   &mdash;   A good chunk of his fortune has been a direct or indirect result of a big government that either spends a lot or enacts a lot of convoluted tax rules.  When the Feds bailed out Goldman Sachs, he personally made $1 billion in earnest.  He also makes a lot off estate planning, people hiring fancy lawyers to circumvent the complicated Federal tax code.  Warren Buffett is personally invested in big spending and big regulating government.</p>
<p>Warren Buffett wants non-parastic wealth earners to pay more in taxes because he&rsquo;ll benefit from it.</p>
<p>The old phrase goes that behind every great fortune is a great crime.  That&rsquo;s probably not true all of the time - I think the better and more accurate way to phrase that mentality is that behind almost every great fortune is almost always some combination of out and out right criminality, immorality, perfidy, and/or just plain luck.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Tutu did not say how he wished the tax to be implemented, but said he hoped whites themselves would &ldquo;agitate&rdquo; for it to be imposed upon them.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a way, he&rsquo;s part right; the only agitating done by whites is a group of whites agitating against all other whites.</p>

You still have many things going for you, for example the first amendment, a higher white population than South Africa (thus theoretical more sane people within that population), many pockets of civilization (secession).</p>
<p>The USA also has got its ANC government but it goes by another, foreign, name. It has to cut that connection, and very fast. That Hydra has to be decapitated before white America can become healthy once more. I cannot understand that fascination with that Hydra, it is less than 3% of your population.</p>

<p>The western press, the celebrities, the UN and the world leaders were in the frontline to bring about the change in South Africa and make this state of affairs possible.<br>
They were persuaded by the silver tongued Tutus and Mandelas to put the boot into the white man. There is no chance of them ( especially the white liberals) admitting they were wrong. They will just have too much egg on their face.</p>
<p>More to the point, with apartheid gone, they now have no career building causes to gain them publicity. So they turn to adopting African children, removing them from their people, language, culture and traditions and transplanting them to the west.<br>
Not a lot different to keeping pretty Polly the parrot in a cage.   <br>

		<p>There are Whites who stay in South Africa because, despite all the efforts made by the government to dispossess them, they can still make money. The genius of White people is to generate wealth. The wealth can be taken away, but not the means by which it was made.</p>

<p>You are correct, there still is money to burn, but:</p>
<p>1) Money is no bullet-proof vest<br>
2) Is it in the best interest of their descendants. The parents must not only think of themselves.<br>
3) Money is not the ultimate value system. There is a price to pay with you conscience if your wealth is built on the corpse of your own race by pandering to the whims of the A.N.C. Even in Zimbabwe I hear there are vulture capitalists that still make a lot of money. </p>
