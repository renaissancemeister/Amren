<h1>$2.5M Medicare Fraud Trial Starts in Baton Rouge</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chron, August 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A doctor, two former ministers and a medical equipment company owner are being tried in federal court for allegedly stealing $2.5 million from Medicare.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Dr. Sofjan M. Lamid of Mandeville allegedly prescribed unneeded equipment provided by Nnanta Felix Ngari&rsquo;s company, Unique Medical Solutions Inc., to patients attracted to church health fairs by Henry Lamont Jones, of Zachary and Ernest Payne, of Houston.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were all working together in a greedy fashion to rip off Medicare,&#8221; federal prosecutor Ben Curtis said during opening arguments Monday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The men were charged in April with conspiring to commit health-care fraud and to pay kickbacks from December 2003 through March 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Curtis said Unique Medical Solution of Prairieville provided power wheelchairs to hundreds of people who didn&rsquo;t need them. Each prescription, Curtis said, was worth thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Lamid was getting paid not to be a doctor, but to write these prescriptions,&#8221; Curtis told jurors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Holthaus and Andre Belanger, who represents Ngari, told jurors not to believe Simmons. She hasn&rsquo;t been sentenced, and &#8220;is after the richest reward of all  &mdash;  freedom,&#8221; Holthaus said.</p>
<p>Belanger said his client, a naturalized immigrant from Nigeria, does honest work. &#8220;Felix Ngari never forged a prescription. Felix Ngari never paid Dr. Lamid or any other doctors to write medically unnecessary prescriptions,&#8221; Belanger said.</p>

<p>And of course the government let this go on for 6 YEARS. Don&rsquo;t tell me it is that hard to audit these foreign &#8220;doctors&#8221; and their suppliers&hellip;.I have read many cases where they (foreigners) fraud the government in Medicare and medicaid. </p>
<p>Yet we are told that they are going to make drastic cuts in our SSA and Medicare for us seniors and disabled? Maybe, if our government did it&rsquo;s job and stopped these 3rd worlders from even coming into our country, we seniors who worked for decades and paid our taxes would be left alone. There would be plenty of SSA monies if our own government kept their hands off it over all these years. If our government would kick all these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; off SSA who come here and never pay a dime into the system and they (immigrants) cheat us on top of that and make millions???  </p>

		<p>I, unfortunately, take Medicare in my practice. I&rsquo;ve known for 30 years it is very, very, very easy to rip off the system if one really sets their mind to it.</p>
<p>I believe Miami Fl is the #1 spot for Medicare fraud due to all the Cubans and Haitians that work it like a family business. Millions upon Millions is easily stolen.</p>
<p>Just get elderly relatives and their friends to come in 3,4 times year, pay them cash, etc, work Little Havana and take the stupid gringo fools for all you can.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take Medicaid for ONE REASON. I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish and just about every African, Mexican, Cuban and other &#8220;Latinos&#8221; has a Medicaid card, 3-4 kids, iPhones and the huge car when they drive up. And they are jingling and jangling gold jewelry.</p>
<p>You white people are complete and total fools and deserve the hell that awaits you. You feed and finance those who hate your guts and your strut around thinking you are sooooooo wonderful with your &#8220;equality&#8221; and &#8220;all God&rsquo;s children&#8221; nonsense.</p>
<p>Re-read your Bible. God was a RACIST, segregationist and separatist. If you don&rsquo;t become that, you will be exterminated by the wonderful people of color.</p>

<p>I suspect you come to these conclusions from reading the Old Testament, which is the Torah, of and about the Hebrew, Jewish people.  Christianity is not supposed to draw its lessons and rules form that, but from the New Testament, which expounds the exact opposite of what you claim.</p>
<p>Scholars understand that the OT or Torah was a tribal style creation theory with a tribal style pseudo historical story of national origin.  In parts, God (Yaweh) is indistinguishable from a war god.  He is later revealed with emotions and demands not very different from Zeus or any other contemporary god of the polytheists.  Exclusiveness was necessary for the formation of the religion because many proto-Jews were polytheists, with little to distinguish themselves from their neighbors.  The Old Testament also reveals the history of a groups transition from one that favored human sacrifice as a means of appeal to the same god.  Christianity repeats that theme with the symbolic human sacrifice, and later even recalls cannibalism with the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Give it up.  Christianity will continue to be the Achilles Heel of white nationalists/separatists, and race realists.  We are better off with a real white war gods like Odin and Thor, who actually have a far older and truer European origin than Christianity.</p>

		<p>Once again the most notable export from Nigeria apart from oil is crime.  Now acknowledged as fraudsters with their 419 fraud, and many international drug dealing, Nigeria is a prime example of what happens to an African country when the European settlers/colonisers are evicted.</p>

		<p>S. California is full of Armenian, Asian, Russian, Indian, Arab, Persian  and Israeli Drs and medical supply houses that do the same thing.  It goes on and on.  I think these at least half these Drs immigrate to the Us just so they can rip off medicare and medicaid.</p>
<p>Aremenian business districts are full of tiny, shabby medical supply stores that are only open about 6 hours a day but gain millions in profit per year from selling those $10,000 or more motor wheel chairs to able bodied people with bogus prescriptions.  The wheelchairs are turned back in to the store by the receipients.  Sometimes the receipients don&rsquo;t even take delivery, the chairs just stay in the stores and are turned over many times.  Often the chairs do not exist, just the bogus rescription and a bogus billing statement.</p>
<p>Few of these immigrant Drs take private insurance plans because private insurance won&rsquo;t use these frauds and private insurance companies watch every penny before it goes out.  Medicare waits years to investigate.</p>

<p>Miami Cubans Escape to Dear Homeland after Medicare Fraud</p>
<p>[Brenda Walker]</p>
<p>Sixty Minutes reported in 2009 that Medicare fraud was &ldquo;A $60 Billion Crime&rdquo;. The segment didn&rsquo;t exactly mention the diversity/immigration aspect, but did observe, &ldquo;If you want to find Medicare fraud, the first place you should look is South Florida.&rdquo; Hint, hint.</p>
<p>South Florida was poisoned 30 years ago by the Mariel Boatlift, which allowed Fidel Castro to rid Cuba of thousands of criminals when President Jimmy Carter welcomed the worst of Cuban society. So the nice American city of Miami was transformed over a few months into a Spanish-speaking, foreign, more criminal place.</p>
<p>In addition, Cubans brought the practice of slaughtering other people&rsquo;s horses (to eat!) to South Florida.</p>
<p>Does anyone in bankrupt Washington care about mega medical fraud? Or is $60 billion in theft too small-fry to get the attention of Beltway brains?</p>
<p>Anyway, the FBI has been trying to chase down some of the worst offenders, who can easily avoid capture by escaping to Cuba. But it&rsquo;s worse than that: there are indications that the Cuban government is willing to welcome big-money Medicare fraudsters, providing they pay a nice fee to the ruling commie criminals.</p>

		<p>The biggest medicare medicaid fraud in history was perpetrated by a Russian/Israeli Dr in Orange County Ca about 7 years ago.</p>
<p>He did not even speak English but in just one year, one year he stole more than 1 billion dollars from medicare and medicaid.</p>
<p>They come with the intention of ripping off the medical system.<br>
They spend years in med and dental school so they can rip off the system.  Or they spend about 5,000 US dollars to buy an authentic medical school transcript and diploma from a credentialed foreign medical school.</p>
<p>Here is how it works.  Get your contact at the medical school.  The clerks and administrators will split the $5,000.  Write a back dated letter asking for application forms.  Fillout the back dated application forms.  </p>
<p>The clerks will then create both a computer and paper file on you as a student. Application forms, letter of acceptance, tuition payments, housing arrangements, classes taken and credits accumulated.  Diploma.</p>
<p>So if anyone actually investigates there is a complete record that you attended and passed classes and clinical training and got your diploma.</p>
<p>Enter the US on a tourist visa, never leave and pay a professional test taker to take the exam of the state you want to practice in.  Put up a sign &#8220;medicare and medicaid accepted&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently in the news in Los Angeles is a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon who set up a liposuction clinic.  He damaged a patient who sued for malpractice.  Plaintiff had the money to hire a private investigator.</p>
<p>The Drs. name is Mohammad.  Turns out he is an illegal alien.  Turns out he never took the California physician licensing exam.</p>
<p>More and more California medicine is taken over by these diversity affirmative action frauds every day.</p>
<p>The University of California hospitals are the very worst in diversity hiring.  Only women and non White minorities, preferably from the most corrupt nations in the world will be hired.  The ideal university of California DR is of course a female from one of the most corrupt nations in the world.</p>
<p>Older people or people who have health problems even diabetes, bronchitis, high blood pressure should seriously think of leaving California due to the critical mass of immigrant Drs who not only rip off medicare and medicaid but may not be Drs at all.</p>

<p>I remember that. Did he get any time in prison for that crime? Did he have to pay anything back?  I doubt it. We White Americans who pay most of the taxes, are a bunch of fools. </p>
<p>So what does our government do? They slash 500 billion from medicare to make up for these foreigners who rip us off daily. Yeah, more 3rd world immigration is the answer. We get all these &#8220;great, competent doctors&#8221; while our government makes sure that more incompetent blacks get into our medical schools. We are most certainly on the losing end in more ways than one. </p>

		<p>Our problem is two pronged. One being medicine being run by the government, when have bureaucrats ever run anything efficiently? The second big problem is an abundance of lawyers who first make complicated open ended laws as legislators then practice it as prosecutors and defense attorneys getting people off on technicalities etc, etc, etc. If medicine were run as any other business without govt involvement, medical costs would be much lower, customer would control costs. If we reform our tort laws it may help tremendously without frivolous law suits also. <br>
I am not in the least bit defending the dirty cheaters just pointing out that we have created the situation, crooks abound all over the world and information about golden geese spreads like wild fire. </p>
<p>Oops! I was wrong there is a third prong. Our education is not as good as it used to be particularly in the sciences top that off with AA.</p>
