<h1>Elizabeth Wright Dies</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, American Renaissance, August 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Elizabeth Wright, the editor of <em>Issues and Views</em>, has died. The Booker T. Washington Society posted a brief notice of her death, but I know of no other mention, in paper or on the Internet, of the passing of this remarkable woman. </p>
<p>On June 20, she had posted an <a href="http://issuesviews.blogspot.com/2011/06/to-all-those-friends-i-never-met.html">ominous notice</a> on her blog, in which she wrote that &#8220;If all goes according to plan, I shall be entering a hospice for cancer care.&#8221; I wrote to her usual e-mail address, asking for more details about her health, but got no reply. It pained me that her final blog notice was titled, &#8220;To All Those Friends I Never Met.&#8221;  I was one of those friends she never met.</p>
<p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that I have been fascinated by Elizabeth Wright ever since I became aware of her many years ago, when <em>Issues and Views</em> was still a paper publication. I discovered that Elizabeth had a piercingly clear understanding of race, and wrote in an uncompromising style. We corresponded, and AR posted several of her essays  &mdash;  and yet I never really knew her. Elizabeth wanted it that way. </p>
<p>We spoke on the phone only a few times, and she spoke as she wrote  &mdash;  clearly and vigorously. And yet she kept me at a distance. The last time we spoke I was in New York City, where she lived, and I practically begged her to let me meet her. She declined. She wasn&rsquo;t keen on meeting people, she said. </p>
<p>There was a great deal I wanted to know about Elizabeth Wright. How did a black woman arrive at a view of race so similar to my own? There is usually a story about how whites become dissenters. There must be a whole book about her. And who were her friends? What did her family think of her views? Whenever I asked in passing about her personal life in our e-mail correspondence, she politely deflected my questions. </p>
<p>I therefore know almost nothing about this remarkable and very private woman. I don&rsquo;t know how old she was, whether she was married or had children, what kind of education she had, or what her interests were aside from smashing taboos. And I know nothing of the price she paid  &mdash;  it must have been very high  &mdash;  for her uncompromising defense of what she held to be true.</p>
<p>Anyone who could write and think as Elizabeth did could have achieved prominence, but that would have required her to bow to convention. Instead, she did that old-fashioned thing now so rare it comes almost as a shock; she put principle first. </p>
<p>Perhaps if I had tried harder, Elizabeth would have let me into her life. But perhaps not. I knocked, but she kept the door closed. </p>
<p>Therefore, much as I admired Elizabeth Wright, I knew her only through her writing, and in tribute to her I can offer readers nothing more than a selection from some of her columns. I think that is what she would have wanted.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Elizabeth. Your friends you never met  &mdash;  and I am sure I am one of a great many  &mdash;  will be poorer without you.</p>
<p>On April 4, 2007, radio host Don Imus referred to the largely black Rutgers women&rsquo;s basketball team as &#8220;nappy-headed hos.&#8221; Mr. Imus even abased himself to Al Sharpton, but lost his job anyway. Elizabeth Wright wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>So, after all this cringing and groveling, what was accomplished? Nothing more than could have been, if Imus had initially said, &#8220;Take this job and stuff it!&#8221; And how many more white men will feel compelled to prostrate themselves at the feet of blacks? While he was down there, it&rsquo;s surprising that Imus failed to wash Sharpton&rsquo;s feet  &mdash;  a practice that actually was performed on the feet of black men by the contrite white members of the &#8220;Christian&#8221; organization Promise Keepers. What a wonderful set of role models they make. 
<p>One of the most unfortunate consequences of this episode is the fact that yet another white man has helped to restore credibility and social power to those two cynical buffoons, Jackson and Sharpton. Just when it looked like their stars were waning, along comes the groveling Imus, to remind us blacks of just who our &#8220;leaders&#8221; are.</blockquote></p>
<p>In the same essay, she touched on Trent Lott, who also did the white man&rsquo;s crawl for having said &#8220;insensitive&#8221; things about race:</p>
<blockquote>Although other whites had disgraced themselves in their various apology stances, Lott set a precedent for white cringing and submission over the race issue. In addition, he sent strong messages, not only to white children, who learned how best to behave when confronted by howling blacks and their confederates, but also to black children, who learned what simple steps are required to bring about the subjection of The Man.</blockquote>
<p>This is from a <a href="/news/2004/05/04/blamingwhitey.html">review</a> of a book by a black woman who railed against &#8220;white privilege&#8221; and all its evils. Elizabeth was skeptical:</p>
<blockquote>Her depictions of the unyielding, recalcitrant white, who struts around like a know-it-all, egotistical peacock, had me wondering if she is paying attention to what&rsquo;s really happening in this society, or if her antenna is picking up signals from a distant era. Where are these preening whites, &#8220;insulated by privilege&#8221; from the problems of blacks, who &#8220;simply choose not to know&#8221;? Is there really anywhere in this society where one can escape the relentless retelling of the story of slavery, Jim Crow, lynchings, and segregated water fountains? Set upon with the type of charges made by people like Dickerson, and eager to comply with the rules of the race game, most whites strive to keep their heads below the radar, so as not to be slammed with the ruinous accusation of &#8220;racist.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>She had <a href="/news/2009/07/on_self-worth_f.html">this</a> to say after hearing former New York City mayor Ed Koch moaning about racism:</p>
<blockquote>Similarly, Ed Koch had claimed that in this terrible society of America, &#8220;all blacks&#8221; face racism &#8220;every day.&#8221; According to Koch, from the minute a black leaves his home in the morning to go to work, he encounters ugly, persistent racism, which goes on throughout the day. My ears perked up, because I wanted to know in just which city or state or region were blacks being tormented openly and on a daily basis. Mind you, he was talking about the year 2008. Of course, he, like the young man in the Bodeker film, did not offer any examples of this horrendous treatment.
<p>My instinct was to get in touch with Koch and challenge him to pick any black man, and go off to work with him, spending the entire day on his job, as well as remaining with him in the evening. I would have liked for Koch to come back on radio and report on the terrible, racist encounters suffered that day by that black man.</p>
<p>Of course, we know that no such encounters are occurring on a daily basis&hellip; .</p>
<p>However, there are clever blacks who insist on invoking the spirit of that earlier scenario and hyping the &#8220;pain of racism,&#8221; a disposition that a great many whites eagerly buy into. The goal of such blacks is to keep whites preoccupied forever with the Black Cause, while expanding the scope of just what constitutes &#8220;racism.&#8221; That scope, of course, must encompass the very thoughts in the heads of others.</blockquote></p>
<p>But of all Elizabeth wrote, <a href="/news/2006/09/a_black_old_rig.html">this</a> powerful passage is perhaps my favorite.</p>
<blockquote>When the white population falls below the 50% mark, the days of whites running interference for blacks will be over. And so will those special laws biased towards safeguarding perquisites for the &#8220;Disadvantaged,&#8221; which can be mighty expensive to enforce.
<p>Again, what are the odds that those 18th century injunctions devised by those funny little men in britches and waistcoats will prevail, once the polyglot new Americans from Asia and Central and South America begin to flex their political muscle?</p>
<p>So many blacks and their white liberal gurus failed to appreciate those Anglo-originated laws based on &#8220;self-evident truths&#8221; and the consent of the governed, which were flexible enough to take under their protection the nation&rsquo;s former slaves. Who will there be to ensure that jobs and scholarships and government contracts, and the surfeit of other entitlements, will be available for a people who have grown used to looking to others for slices from the economic pie, instead of baking their own share of it?</p>
<p>Once what&rsquo;s left of constitutional law is gone, partly out of neglect, because the story of the Constitution and its creators will no longer be taught in the various Chinese-Indian-Latino-Arab colored school systems, a new corner will be turned. If blacks think they&rsquo;ve been mistreated at the hands of whites, just wait until the affirmative action, set aside party is over  &mdash;  when there is no one to insist that they get undeserved perks, or have a &#8220;right&#8221; to intrude themselves into places where they are not wanted.</p>
<p>The new dominant ethnics come to this land with their own sob stories of oppression. Unlike whites, they are hardly likely to fall over one another to apologize for past wrongs. Nor are they likely to spend their time in Congress concocting new laws designed to discriminate against their own sons and daughters in favor of blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reparations,&#8221; did you say? Just wait until the first move is made to un-name and re-name some of those Martin Luther King, Jr. boulevards.</blockquote></p>

Did Ms. Wright have a subscription to American Renaissance?</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to learn how she developed her views. Were they uniquely her own through observation and experience or was she reading the works of others? They certainly could have appeared in any edition of American Renaissance.</p>
<p>In black circles, Ms. Wright was likely ignored if not vilified as a race traitor, sell out, or Uncle Tom. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too bad we couldn&rsquo;t know more. I hope AR editors consider publishing more of her work. </p>

		<p>Thank you, Mr. Taylor, for pointing out that not all blacks are stupid, gullible, and racist.  Some of them haven&rsquo;t been swayed by the propaganda of white liberals and black race hustlers, anymore than all white people have.  <br>
However, most blacks are afraid to speak against the politically correct message of the left for the same reasons that other races are.  Possibly, Ms. Wright was fearful of meeting Mr. Taylor and being publicly linked with him.  Her job and social standing may have been on thin ice as it was.  She probably only got away with what she said because she&rsquo;s a black criticizing blacks.  </p>

<p>I searched the internet for photo of Elizabeth Wright (<i>and yes, she was most always <b>right</b> in her essays</i>) and found <a href="http://ohiorepublic.blogspot.com/2011_01_01_archive.html" rel="nofollow">this website</a>. Scroll about half-way down to view her photo.</p>

<p>I was told that Elizabeth Wright told an executive with the CofCC that she would renounce her endorsement of the organization if they ever stopped being explicitly pro-white.</p>

		<p>This is a most remarkable story. One wonders how we can be sure of her race, but given the current political climate in this country towards so-called &#8220;free speech&#8221; concerning racial matters, it is no mystery why Mrs. Wright would be so serious about maintaining her privacy.</p>

<p>A remarkable woman indeed. The Anti-Laquisha. Sorry to see her go   &mdash;   especially with so little fanfare. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read the occasional item by Elizabeth Wright here on AR over the years, but I didn&rsquo;t know most of the above facts. In reading her, I too been struck by the same cognitive dissonance: &#8220;This was written by a BLACK person?&#8221; Truly a shame that current racial/political climate wouldn&rsquo;t allow for someone like her to thrive rather than toil in obscurity. (Of course the same could be said for AR.) </p>
<p>Did Mr. Taylor or anyone on here ever see a photo of her? I&rsquo;d been curious to know just how black she really was in pigmentation, etc. I&rsquo;d venture that her African content was 1/2 at most, and very possibly only 1/4. Yes, she called herself &#8220;black&#8221;, but so does Rev. Jeremiah Wright and he appears to me to be only 1/8. </p>

		<p>As one of Elizabeth Wright&rsquo;s followers for a number of years now, the news of her death is both devastating and heartbreaking. Like me, Ms. Wright was an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; and proud of it. Sure, she vilified race-baiters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and others of their ilk. But she did so because she recognized how those two idiots were keeping black Americans from reaching their true potential. Although I&rsquo;m of a generation of young blacks who&rsquo;ve come to embrace the likes of Jackson and Sharpton, I thank Ms. Wright for steering me away from their point of view and helped open my eyes to the true nature of today&rsquo;s racial climate.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Wright knew of a time when blacks not only survived, but thrived in this country without the white man&rsquo;s support. Through her website, she attempted to remind blacks (and whites) of the days blacks did not need to be around white folks to legitimize themselves as human beings; that black folks did pretty okay through self-reliance and entrepreneurship. Perhaps, in a way, Ms. Wright was trying to recapture those forgotten days  when blacks conducted themselves with civility and problems such as a high illegitimacy rate, black-on-black mayhem and the welfare state were almost non-existent. </p>
<p>But alas! Nothing lasts forever. Thanks to black integrationists and their white liberals, the era of real black success is, for the most part, a forgotten memory; and is likely to stay that way so long black elitists keep the majority of blacks in check with reminders that &#8220;racism is still black America&rsquo;s greatest obstacle.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Elizabeth Wright was a prophet for Black America; someone who spoke truth to power and was pretty much ignored for doing so. Thankfully, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams and other free-thinking blacks will carry on challenging the current black political establishment with their thoughtful commentaries on what&rsquo;s really holding blacks back. The day when black America finally understands and accepts the true nature of their situation and take steps to change things for the better is when, I think, Ms. Wright&rsquo;s mission will be accomplished.</p>
<p>Until then, you&rsquo;ve done a fine job telling it like it is, Ms. Wright. Rest In Peace!</p>

<p>Yes, she looks 100% black. I have read many of her articles and she sure seemed to have her head on her shoulders. Too bad that the black community did not pay attention to her and at least acknowledge her passing. </p>
<p>Another good black man is Emmanuel McLittle that no one ever heard about.He no longer contributes to that site but there is a link below to some of his writings. I heard him on a tape years ago talking to a preacher and he had great sense. He NEVER put down White people or blamed them whatsoever for anything.</p>

		<p>One can only wish the majority of the blacks were like her.  She too lament the passing of a white America and the history that was part of its making.  Due to inept and foolish leadership, this country is losing its glorious past, present, and future.  The most evil is the brainwashing of the white youth in the schools to wish the death of this country.  Instead of teaching both sides of a story, the youths are only told how evil this country is in its deeds.</p>

Hail, Hail, to the original human being, above the bounds and shackles of history and convention.<br>
I sure would like to see many more of your type around in this world. Black or White, if most people were like you, we&rsquo;d have a fine, peaceful, society. People who have dignity and discernment. And the burden you carried for it. Yet you rose above, Hail.<br>

<p>I found one image of Elisabeth Wright in a google image search. She somewhat resembles Michelle Obama, and appears to be predominantly of black ancestry. Obviously, she had been made into an unperson. Who will take her place?</p>

		<p>Elizabeth Wright was a great and brave woman.  We all know how we here are vilified by all &#8220;right thinking&#8221; folks.  Think how much harder it must have been for a black woman expressing the views she had.  She was very libertarian in her views and believed the government should just leave us all alone.  Wouldn&rsquo;t that be nice?<br>

		<p>Many literate and able Blacks who appear uninfected by liberal myths and who are political realists are greatly aided by having copies of AR provided them unrequested  &mdash;  perhaps, in fact, anonymously.  It is much easier to become interested in such information from a standpoint of personal puzzlement, or even puzzlement tinged with a bit of contrived indignation  &mdash;  than it is to have to explain to other Blacks why one took a personal initiative to get in touch with &#8220;such stuff&#8221;.  There is no evolved etiquette for such an unusual circumstance other than what thoughtful regard provides.  Nothing productive for anyone is likely to arise from putting anonymously donated copies of AR into the hands of Blacks who are possessed of the myths of our time.  My own hunch is that in the mid-90&rsquo;s Elizabeth Wright was provided just such an anonymous (then hard copy) donation of AR.  </p>

		<p>I would urge racially aware whites to consider the fact that this woman&rsquo;s opinions meant NOTHING to the liberals, race traitors and non-whites, least of all blacks.  More to the point, she is an extremely rare exception to near universal genocidal hate among blacks for everyone else, but, most of all whites.</p>
<p>A big part of the problem with whites is our ethnocentrism.  We have trouble accepting the depths of evil, others are not only capable of, but openly celebrate.  We have trouble understanding that only whites really think, act and value themselves as individuals.  Other races, especially blacks, adopt a mob mentality.  And make choices as a group.</p>
<p>What I am getting at is, no, the existence of a person like Wright does not mean there is any hope whatsoever that blacks will eventually become normal, decent, human beings, for the most part.  It especially does not mean there is any hope for living with them in peace&hellip;.we have hundreds of years, bitter, bitter experience that should be sufficient to dispel that hope&hellip;..and the foolish behavior that comes with it.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, you could choose to befriend such a person.  Many do and consider their black friends exceptional.  But I would point out, that, all too often, such friendship results in your children molested, your wife raped, yourself shot&hellip;.as your &#8220;exceptional&#8221; friend turned out to be only a good enough actor for you to let your guard down.</p>
<p>There are some tough decisions ahead for whites.  Assuming we don&rsquo;t choose to lay down and die, as the people in Zimbabwe and South Africa have chosen.  There are things that must be done TO people like Elizabeth Wright, who don&rsquo;t deserve such things as individuals, but can&rsquo;t be treated as individuals because the group they belong to is so intractably, insanely, heinously evil and malevolent towards us.  The Elizabeth Wrights of the world will be brought up as the main resistance to such things.  But that sentiment cannot be indulged.</p>
<p>Radical separation is necessary for the survival of the human species itself.  If whites allow ourselves to die off, the rest of humanity will quickly follow.  We&rsquo;ve simply left too many dangerous things in the world for them to simply devolve back to what they were before whites basically elevated the entire world.  Without whites, nuclear holocaust, complete extermination of all life via nerve and biological agents will quickly become something the non-whites have no problem doing.</p>
<p>Whites need to separate, and then increase our numbers.  Our first duty is to ourselves, in this regard.  But the world depends on us.  They may squawk about white privilege and power and are quick to murder us.  But only a short time passes before they desperately want us back to stop the suffering and mischief they get themselves into.</p>
<p>And that means the future Elizabeth Wrights of the world must, absolutely MUST be forced over new borders to be with their own kind&hellip;..who will undoubtedly harm them indiscriminately.  </p>
<p>The issue, in its most direct terms is we can&rsquo;t let Elizabeth Wrights stay in our safe, prosperous lands and avoid being victimized by their own kind, because her children will grow up and harm every white they come into contact with.</p>
<p>Were it not so&hellip;but it must be accepted.  Blacks, unlike whites, do not pass on virtuous traits from generation to generation.  Just look at population of blacks in the US, who have &#8220;made it&#8221;.  Intact family, good job, safe neighborhood, good school.  And their children turn out to be crackheads and violent thugs anyway&hellip;.even if they inherit a trait like high IQ from their parents.</p>
<p>So we get ridiculous situations where a valedictorian in a rich neighborhood might be black&hellip;..and pregnant with some gang bangers baby&hellip;.addicted to drugs, and arrested for murder.  No&hellip;not rare&hellip;.all too common.</p>
<p>Because of THAT tendency, Elizabeth Wright means nothing.  Just an anomaly in a nearly unbroken tapestry of evil.</p>
<p>Whites have a deep, ingrained desire to pretend it isn&rsquo;t so.  To gather together a few exceptional blacks, uplift them and live in peace and harmony with them. It&rsquo;s not possible.  And history has left a trail of blood and tears in the wake of people who tried to make it happen.  People who met the Elizabeth Wrights of the world.  The Pastor Mannings.  That coworker you hang out with at work who would be shocked to know you read Amren.  We all want to allow the hope these people kindle in our hearts to grow and make the world a different place than it actually is.</p>
<p>Bad idea&hellip;.with HARSH consequences.  The time is rapidly coming when that won&rsquo;t be allowed anymore out of shear survival instinct.  It has to happen.  There really isn&rsquo;t any choice anymore.  It&rsquo;s that or death.</p>

She was a highly intelligent woman with moral fibre, a woman of wisdom and fiercely independent.  &ldquo;Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come&rdquo; (Proverbs: 31:25). What a woman! <br>
God bless Elizabeth Wright. <br>

		<p>Some well-behaved blacks will talk with you candidly about reality. It&rsquo;s always in private, as they would  be shouted down (or worse) in a group of their own people. Even consverative blacks cannot seem to get away from justifiying entitlements and victim status. Larry Elder had similar views as this intelligent woman, but he lost his talk show host job eventually. Very few want to accept the truth. The truth has been killed&hellip;as minorities take over this country, the special privileges will die with it. </p>

<p>We have all probably speculated as to how many blacks are &#8220;good&#8221;, ie that they know and appreciate the undeniable truth that whites have done incomparably more to uplift blacks than to unfairly exploit them as contemporary &#8220;history&#8221; books would have it.

As one of Elizabeth Wright&rsquo;s followers for a number of years now, the news of her death is both devastating and heartbreaking. Like me, Ms. Wright was an &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rdquo; and proud of it. Sure, she vilified race-baiters like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and others of their ilk. But she did so because she recognized how those two idiots were keeping black Americans from reaching their true potential. Although I&rsquo;m of a generation of young blacks who&rsquo;ve come to embrace the likes of Jackson and Sharpton, I thank Ms. Wright for steering me away from their point of view and helped open my eyes to the true nature of today&rsquo;s racial climate.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Wright knew of a time when blacks not only survived, but thrived in this country without the white man&rsquo;s support. Through her website, she attempted to remind blacks (and whites) of the days blacks did not need to be around white folks to legitimize themselves as human beings; that black folks did pretty okay through self-reliance and entrepreneurship. Perhaps, in a way, Ms. Wright was trying to recapture those forgotten days when blacks conducted themselves with civility and problems such as a high illegitimacy rate, black-on-black mayhem and the welfare state were almost non-existent. </p>
<p>But alas! Nothing lasts forever. Thanks to black integrationists and their white liberals, the era of real black success is, for the most part, a forgotten memory; and is likely to stay that way so long black elitists keep the majority of blacks in check with reminders that &ldquo;racism is still black America&rsquo;s greatest obstacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Elizabeth Wright was a prophet for Black America; someone who spoke truth to power and was pretty much ignored for doing so. Thankfully, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams and other free-thinking blacks will carry on challenging the current black political establishment with their thoughtful commentaries on what&rsquo;s really holding blacks back. The day when black America finally understands and accepts the true nature of their situation and take steps to change things for the better is when, I think, Ms. Wright&rsquo;s mission will be accomplished.</p>
<p>Until then, you&rsquo;ve done a fine job telling it like it is, Ms. Wright. Rest In Peace!</p>

Reportedly within the U.S. Army bases within the U.S.,  there are numerous  instances of  candid and cooperative and helpful conversations between some Blacks, on the one hand, and some whites, on the other, regarding racial realities.

		<p>Ms. Wright is probably one of the few Black thinkers who ever studied the writings of Booker T. Washington very closely.</p>
<p>Washington was on record as being completely against civil rights laws that granted Blacks equal rights to Whites  &mdash;  unless they first proved that they deserved those rights.  He was also against integration  &mdash;  again, if Blacks were, in fact, equally capable as Whites, they should be able to prove that ability in their separate communities first.  No wonder that he is rarely taught in schools today.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, there are quite a number of black folks out there who are, indeed, capable of independent thought. Just because I may sound &#8220;white-washed&#8221; in terms of my views on race and American society doesn&rsquo;t make me any less Negro. (Or maybe it does as far as most blacks are concerned.) Sure, my black peers have labeled me an &#8220;Uncle Ruckus&#8221; (The new word for &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; among blacks), but &#8220;sticks and stones&hellip;.&#8221;, and all that jazz.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain that the late Ms. Elizabeth Wright dealt with social shunning from her black peers due to her non-conformist opinions. But she didn&rsquo;t let that deter her from speaking her mind about racial orthodoxies in this country; and neither will I. This will be my way of honoring Ms. Wright&rsquo;s memory.</p>

<p>Like I said, I know Elizabeth Wright personally spoke to a CofCC national board member and told him in no uncertain terms that she would withdraw her support of the CofCC if it ever stopped being explicitly pro white.  This CofCC board member would have no reason to lie to me, and to the others he told about this, when it comes to these sorts of things.  </p>

		<p>Richard (# 35): Yes, you are.</p>
<p>Anonymous (# 42): So, an unsupported claim of having met the woman, made by (or else on behalf of) a man that you otherwise would probably consider an enemy, an inferior, and not worth trusting, on either account, is nonetheless sufficient to prove to you, beyond any doubt, that he did, in fact, meet her at the stated time and place, and that she was certainly the same woman depicted in the lone picture yet found on the entire Google-indexed Web wherein she is identified by that name? You will pardon, I am sure, my being a somewhat more skeptical person than you&hellip;.</p>
<p>Here is what is claimed at the Web site that you cite:</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth Wright lived in New York City, which is probably why she made herself such a shut in. There were never many pictures of her, and DLJ did meet her once at a Black Conservative conference in 1995 in Washington DC, the week of the OJ Verdict (and a week before the Million Man March), and that&rsquo;s just as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>[As a long-time resident of New York City myself, I fail to follow that Afrocentric line of reasoning&hellip;.]</p>
<p>So, have you verified yet that there was such a &#8220;Black Conservative conference&#8221; that took place in Washington, D.C., between October 3 and 16, 1995, (let alone that the cited meeting took place during it)? (How did a radical black activist gain access to the alleged conference, and find himself meeting the woman in question? Why would a woman who was willing to mingle, in public, with &#8220;Black Conservative confere[es]&#8221; and radical gate-crashers, alike, be yet unwilling to meet privately with her own ally, Jared Taylor?) Did you find any others of those &#8220;never many pictures of her&#8221; referred to (because that phrase certainly implies to me that the writer knew of more than one such picture  &mdash;   along with the subsequent implication that the paucity of such pictures was &#8220;just as well&#8221; because of how ugly she looked!)?</p>
<p>So far, the only Black political conference that I have been able to establish having taken place in Washington, D.C. during that time period was this one:</p>
<p>&#8220;On October 16, 1995, Louis Farrakhan held his now-famous &#8216;Million Man March&rsquo; in Washington, DC.  On October 15, a number of Farrakhan&rsquo;s kindred spirits organized, as a preview to the following day&rsquo;s activities, an event billed as the &#8216;Black African Holocaust Nationhood Conference.&rsquo; Malik Zulu Shabazz served as master of ceremonies, telling those in attendance that blacks were little more than outcasts of American society. &#8216;America should be glad that every black man is not on a killing spree for all the suffering they [white Americans] have done,&rsquo; he said. The highly anticipated climax of the proceedings began when Shabazz introduced the event&rsquo;s final scheduled speaker, Khalid Abdul Muhammad. With the audience standing and cheering, Shabazz said, &#8216;We wanna bring on a man who gives the white man nightmares. We wanna bring on a man who makes the Jews pee in they [sic] pants at night. He&rsquo;s like black Raid on white roaches.&rsquo; [http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/khalidabdulmuhammadexpanded.html]</p>
<p>You will pardon me again, I am sure, if I dismiss that as a plausible candidate for the alleged &#8220;Black Conservative conference&#8221; that supposedly took place in Washington, D.C., between October 3 and 16, 1995&hellip;.</p>
<p>At any rate, I did not see any comment claiming that she was a fraud  &mdash;   to wit, a white woman posing as a black woman, to give her opinions on the subject of race more force  &mdash;   but rather merely a few, my own especially, that raised suspicions of that possibility. Other posters may speak for themselves as to the bases of their own skepticism. Mine is based on the fact that her writings do not ring true to me as coming from a black woman, and do not seem similar in either tone or content to those of other Black skeptics of Black orthodoxy whom I have read over the years, along with her seemingly (and suspiciously) pathological aversion to being seen and photographed, especially considering the public advocacy in which she chose to involve herself. Again, though, I am not claiming that she was white, and that that one known photo was a fraud; I have merely raised that possibility, until such time as I am persuaded that someone of reasonably high credibility attests to meeting and working with that woman (in the photograph) under that name. That does not strike me as being too much to ask&hellip;.</p>
<p>Question Diversity (# 45): If I were to accept, arguendo, that your statement is true and correct, &#8220;personally&#8221; still does not necessarily denote to me a face-to-face meeting (which would be, at any rate, inconsistent with her reticence to meet Mr. Taylor in person). If she placed a phone call to the man, it would still be her telling him so &#8220;personally.&#8221; (She could have written him a letter, rather than speaking to him, and it still would have been done &#8220;personally,&#8221; as long as it was signed by her and addressed to him &#8220;personally.&#8221;) Did he explicitly tell you and the others that he had met her face-to-face, or merely that he &#8220;spoke to her&#8221;?</p>

		<p>We should acknowledge the worthy accomplishments of any person regardless of race. We should especially hold out the hand of friendship and goodwill to someone like Ms. Wright, a nonwhite who displayed the very considerable courage required to speak truth about race, even though that truth disfavored her own race. If any black person was NOT a racist, Ms. Wright was that person. So God bless her!</p>
<p>That said, I agree with the anonymous poster about not succumbing to excessive sentimentality. We whites will never enjoy true security for ourselves and our posterity until we create White Zion, or the Racial Apartheid State. We must possess our own segregated, sovereign, defensible territory FOR WHITES ONLY. No Exceptions! Call it a &#8220;fortress&#8221;, call it a &#8220;reservation&#8221;. But we must have that homeland. We cannot allow Western Civilization to be put in jeopardy simply to avoid giving offense to honest and honorable persons of other backgrounds.</p>
<p>To the black and Indian commenters here, if you are genuine well-wishers of white civilization then you should support the creation of such a whites-only homeland.   </p>

<p>Those whites here that accuse her of being a fraud should be ashamed of themselves.

<p>Anyway she has passed this world now. Race is irrelevant in the next life. May she RIP.</p>

<p></p>
<p>I agree. This of you who are calling this woman a phony and a fraud should be ashamed of your yourselves. The fact is that Ms.Wright (A Black Woman)spoke alot of powerful truths in her columns that many of us supposedly race conscious Whites would not dare say publically. It is so disheartening to see such brave, proud, decent honorable Black people like Ms.Wright get attacked by peole like some of the posters on this board whose main effort in defending our race is making anonymous, disrespectful, insulting, unsubstantiated comments on a website.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>

<p>I can understand why people like &#8220;Jake&#8221; are suspicious.  But I believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Elizabeth Wright existed, and was a black woman.  She might been the only black person to think the things she did, but she did, and she definitely was black.</p>
<p>My only admonition from all this that I hope we don&rsquo;t feel any better about the way we think simply because there was one black person on Earth who endorsed our way of thinking.  We don&rsquo;t need permission from any black, Elizabeth Wright or otherwise, to be white people and to embrace ideologies to our racial well-being.  The whole irony is that she would have agreed with the statement I just made.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>Anonymous (# 48): I can well see why you choose to comment anonymously rather than pseudonymously. Apparently, you do not know what the word &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; even means  &mdash;   on top of the fact that such a charge against me, coming from an anonymous poster at a site where many of its denizens, anonymous and otherwise, believe that any of the tens of millions of white Americans who vote Democratic are all &#8220;GODLESS&#8221; and &#8220;DEMONIC&#8221; Marxists (cultural and/or traditional), intent on the imminent subjugation of their own nation to a worldwide conspiracy of &#8220;GODLESS&#8221; and &#8220;DEMONIC&#8221; Marxists (ditto), and the subsequent genocide of their own race!</p>
<p>At any rate, nothing that I had posted above claims, implies, insinuates, nor, in any way, requires a conspiracy. If my suspicions actually were proved out, it would mean that &#8216;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo; was a white woman who claimed in her public advocacy to be a black woman, and who once had provided (presumably upon request) a picture of some anonymous black woman to represent her fake persona (whether or not her name was genuinely her own). It would also mean that one (or another) radical black leftist lied about having met her once, in the first half of October 1995. It would not mean that anyone besides &#8216;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo; herself had known of her subterfuge  &mdash;   including any radical black leftist or white ultra-conservative.</p>
<p>Even if Ms. Wright was precisely who and what she purported to be, including the woman in the lone photograph purported to be of her, that hardly precludes your trusted radical black leftist from having lied about having met her (or someone in his stead having lied about his having met her) on that one occasion, in October 1995. People quite often lie about having met someone well known. (I myself have an old lawyer-friend who pathologically lies about having met celebrities. I consider it a disagreeable quirk of his personality and character. I assume that he considers my own pathological aversion to lying similarly.)</p>
<p>So, wherein lies the claimed conspiracy among parties &#8220;to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or an act which becomes unlawful as a result of the secret agreement&#8221; (per Merriam-Webster.com) in anything that I posted above? (As for your practicing psychiatry without a license, as a former lawyer with an M.S. degree in Personality and Social Psychology, my semi-professional advice would be that you cease and desist posthaste&hellip;.)</p>

		<p>While I feel that this woman had the best of intentions from a purely human standpoint (not seeing color as what&rsquo;s determined to be fair or unfair in this world), I have to agree that we shouldn&rsquo;t be trapped into thinking that this is how most blacks would act. Numerous violent crimes and race riots, sleepless nights for innocent White victims&rsquo; surviving family members, ineptitude of law enforcement all over America and overseas tell us different.</p>
<p>But I will not speak disparaging of this woman because it appears that she only wanted what we as White sympathizers want. Truth and fairness in our daily lives on all things, especially racial matters. It&rsquo;s a shame that Sharpton, Farrah-con, Jesse Jackson, and &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Jeremiah Wrong screw up the race relations in this country. Bought and paid for by out-of-touch liberals, but also RINO&rsquo;s like Rick Perry, W. (as in waste) Bush, and Rush Limbaugh. These are all people who are so delusional about the state of America that they have to spin and slither their way to the top of the ratings by meaningless soundbites that the dummyed-down masses of uneducated or under-educated kids in this country hang on every word. It&rsquo;s disgraceful that we allowed it to get to this.</p>
<p>Now almost ten years later, after I had a moment of clarity about race relations in this country, I can say that those in power and those with $ have seen the better behavior of blacks in Hollywood, NY, &amp; DC. Except for maybe some street crimes that they probably choose not to research. The White liberals in America think that all blacks will assimilate like their co-stars in movies. People who seem to be stand up individuals like Will Smith, Ving Rhames, Samuel L. Jackson, Morgan Freeman&hellip;etc. </p>
<p>We who have the unfortunate habit of tracking crime on our streets see quite a different picture with blacks, although I&rsquo;ve had the privilege with working with some great black people, I still would always err on the side of caution around them. It&rsquo;s my choice until the elites tell me otherwise. Then it will truly be a sad day in this country. RIP Ms. Elizabeth Wright. It sounds like you were one in a million. </p>

<p>Question Diversity (# 55): Yes, but that is the same picture that is available through a Google Images search (as noted by someone else, early in this comment thread)  &mdash;   and apparently the only such picture purporting to be of THE &#8216;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo;  &mdash;   with this new person merely copying the obituary notice from the black radical&rsquo;s Web site, picture and all. What that is supposed to prove, at this point, escapes my meager grasp!?! That picture was posted on the Web as of January 16 of this year; and so, I assume that that is just where the black radical copied it from, and then placed it in his site&rsquo;s obituary of her  &mdash;   which this other (right-wing) site has now merely reproduced, in full, to show just how mean-spirited such Leftists really are. (I agree!)</p>
<p>Shall I now assume, after your two recent replies, that you are unable to confirm whether the &#8220;CofCC national board member&#8221; that you previously had cited had claimed that he had spoken to her in person, rather than by telephone? Thank you, regardless, for your time and attention!</p>

<p>Unlike the other person criticizing you in this contretemps, I&rsquo;m not going to bash you for your critical thinking here.  Our people should engage in more of it.</p>
<p>However, the CofCC national board member who spoke to her is the kind of person who would have picked up on something &#8220;not quite right&#8221; about her if there was something &#8220;not quite right.&#8221;  So if Elizabeth Wright were actually white, this person would have picked up on that, and told me.  He had no reason to lie to me or to hold anything back from me.</p>
<p>To think that Elizabeth Wright wasn&rsquo;t a black woman, you have to believe that a &#8220;hard right&#8221; national organization and a far left group of rabble rousers (the One Sheeple&rsquo;s Project), each one openly despises the other, have to be in cahootz to claim a white woman is really black.</p>
<p>Occam&rsquo;s Razor.</p>
<p>I believe beyond a reasonable doubt that Elizabeth Wright was not only real, but was a black woman.  I never saw Julius Caesar or John F. Kennedy, but I believe beyond a reasonable doubt they existed.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity (# 58): I take it (from the second paragraph of your most recent reply) that you are tacitly admitting that your friend did not speak to her face-to-face, but (presumably) only by telephone!?! Not knowing your friend, I am not able to grant him the sixth-sense that you so willingly do. If he never saw her in person, then he cannot say for certain whether she was black, white or whatever else. He can merely state what she claimed, or else what he simply assumed, to be the case. She obviously would have claimed to be black, if the issue arose, whether she was or was not, as that was the whole point of her persona as a racial activist, whether that was genuine or contrived. Again, I am not claiming that she was white; I have merely raised that suspicion. Neither am I claiming that your friend lied to you, or otherwise misled you. The point is that his belief about the race of a woman whom he had not met face-to-face, nor otherwise seen in person anywhere, was just that: a belief!</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, nothing that I had posted above claims, implies, insinuates, nor, in any way, requires a conspiracy. If my suspicions actually were proved out, it would mean that &lsquo;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo; was a white woman who claimed in her public advocacy to be a black woman, and who once had provided (presumably upon request) a picture of some anonymous black woman to represent her fake persona (whether or not her name was genuinely her own). It would also mean that one (or another) radical black leftist lied about having met her once, in the first half of October 1995. It would not mean that anyone besides &lsquo;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo; herself had known of her subterfuge &mdash;  including any radical black leftist or white ultra-conservative.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, what part of my earlier explanation could you yourself not follow?</p>
<p>In my first post under this article, I asked a rather simple factual question; to wit: &#8220;Is anyone able to certify that he or she worked with the writer known as Elizabeth Wright, in person?&#8221; In just under half a day from now, it will be a full week since I posed that simple question. It still stands here  &mdash;   as yet, unanswered by anyone!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right.  He never met her face to face, only talked to her on the phone, only once that I know of.</p>
<p>Now, on the topic of evading the obvious for a half week, I get the feeling that you&rsquo;re trying to make some sort of implication that you&rsquo;re not really comfortable in stating outright, so you&rsquo;ve been hinting around it for the better part of a week.</p>
<p>What is it?  </p>
<p>Obviously, you dismiss the conspiracy theory.  And you also admit that some woman existed who wrote these words and spoke to people.  My guess is that you think &#8220;Elizabeth Wright&#8221; was really a white woman and a scam artist trying to hustle money based on the pretense of being a pro-WN black woman, who was able to get away with her &#8220;scam&#8221; because she could make herself sound black.</p>
<p>Is that it, or is it something else?</p>

		<p>Question Diversity (# 60): How many times must I repeat myself here?!? I have stated several times already in this comment thread that I was not claiming (charging, accusing, whatevering) that the recently departed &#8216;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo; was other than what Jared Taylor portrays her to be, and what she had portrayed herself to be in print; I have merely raised the gnawing SUSPICION that she MIGHT not have been that person. I explained why I have that gnawing suspicion: her writings simply do not ring true to me, as someone who has been trained in a wide variety of relevant disciplines, and who is familiar with the writings of many other heterodox blacks on the issue of race. As I said a week ago (to the very minute), &#8220;this all strikes me as exceedingly hinky!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>To answer your own stated suspicion: No, I am not claiming (charging, accusing, whatevering) that the recently departed &#8216;Elizabeth Wright&rsquo; was &#8220;a scam artist trying to hustle money based on the pretense of being a pro-WN black woman, who was able to get away with her &#8216;scam&rsquo; because she could make herself sound black.&#8221; I am able to apply William&rsquo;s razor as well as the next guy (and usually better); and, in the instant case, I would merely assume that the simple reason for such a pretense would have been to make her writings more forceful, by stating that these views came from a black woman, rather than a white woman.</p>
