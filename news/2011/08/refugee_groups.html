	<p>Toronto-area immigrant groups aren&rsquo;t impressed with Ottawa&rsquo;s plans to provide free airline tickets and a $2,000 &#8220;golden handshake&#8221; to failed refugees to return home.</p>
<p>They doubt many claimants will take up the offer when sweeping changes to the refugee determination process takes affect next June.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people fear for their lives they won&rsquo;t be returning home for any money,&#8221; said Victor Wong, of the Chinese Canadian National Council. &#8220;We should be doing more to help people who need our assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for claimants to receive protection after their refugee claims have been turned down, Wong said.</p>
<p>He said the upcoming, controversial Balanced Refugee Reform Act will have to undergo reviews to determine if it is working.</p>
<p>The act will give Ottawa the power to purchase airline tickets and hand out up to $2,000 to failed refugees if they return home. Ottawa said the claimants can used the funds to upgrade their education or training at home.</p>
<p>Francisco Rico-Martinez, of the FCJ Refugee Centre in Toronto, said the law will require mechanisms to handle complaints from claimants.</p>
<p>&#8220;The program is good but there is little attraction for people to leave,&#8221; Rico-Martinez said. &#8220;There is nothing here to motivate people to change their mind to go back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the program will only affect those who arrive in Canada after next June.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who need the program now will be excluded,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The program should continue for many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rico-Martinez said the &#8220;independent service provider&#8221; chosen by Ottawa to provide funds to the failed claimants will have to be monitored to curb abuse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canadian taxpayers will save a lot of money by getting these people to leave right away,&#8221; lawyer Richard Kurland said. &#8220;If they don&rsquo;t leave, we will have to pay much more later to carry them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurland said it costs millions of dollars to &#8220;track, monitor and remove&#8221; failed claimants who may go underground and not leave.</p>
<p>By kicking out the claimants, Canadians won&rsquo;t have to pay for their health coverage, pension, employment, Old Age Security and other benefits, he said.</p>
<p>Toronto lawyer Mendel Green said most of the claimants won&rsquo;t return for money.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who fear for their lives won&rsquo;t be returning home,&#8221; Green said on Wednesday. &#8220;Offering them money to return home is ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>Canada&rsquo;s &#8220;refugee&#8221; program is notorious as being the most lax in the world. If you&rsquo;re a Third Worlder, and your attempts at claiming refugee status have been turned down as being inadequate and/or obviously falsified by the US, UK, Germany, and Australia, don&rsquo;t despair   &mdash;   there&rsquo;s still CANADA you can try! No matter how ridiculous or unconvincing your story is, the Canadians will still fall for it! Those suckers will believe ANYTHING!</p>
<p>So if the claims by these &#8220;refugees&#8221; (never type that word without scare-quotes) are being found worthless even by the bleeding-heart liberals of Canada&rsquo;s &#8220;refugee&#8221; acceptance program, then you KNOW these claims are utterly without merit. </p>
<p>Therefore, if the Canadian Govt is generous enough   &mdash;   and by &#8220;generous&#8221; I mean of course &#8220;naive&#8221; and &#8220;weak-willed&#8221;   &mdash;   to offer these scammers a free ride home plus TWO GRAND, then these &#8220;applicants&#8221; should be counting their lucky stars! Yeah, maybe they&rsquo;re going back to a place that&rsquo;s dangerous   &mdash;   but how is that Canada&rsquo;s problem? We Canadians have problems of our own, and we sure don&rsquo;t need more of anybody else&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>My solution? These people should be given the &#8220;$2000 + airfare home&#8221; offer ONCE AND ONCE ONLY. If they balk at this offer EVEN A LITTLE, or show the slightest ingratitutde, the offer will be immediately changed to &#8220;airfare home only, starting immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>They should then be taken into custody, driven to the airport, and put on the next flight back to whatever glorious homeland they came here from. </p>
<p>IOW: &#8220;Bye-bye, Mbongo. Y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t come back now, y&rsquo;hear?&#8221; </p>

		<p>Economic asylum seekers aren&rsquo;t dumb.</p>
<p>They know the value of obtaining a First World passport: access to free education and modern standards of healthcare, opportunities for employment in a white-run country, the benefits of residency in a society run by whites, the possibility of intermarriage with a white person, and all of this for them and any offspring they may have for eternity.</p>
<p>A measly $2000 doesn&rsquo;t compare.</p>

		<p>Since they fear to go home they&rsquo;ll be staying in Canada. But since they are here, Canadians have legitimate reason to fear, not ignorant home grown bigots, but these immigrants. So should Canadians leave Canada and go over there? If so, will they live in fear in these far away non-white lands? White flight has it&rsquo;s limits and a limit to the places left where one can run away to, even in the great white north. </p>

<p>I certainly hope white Canada apologizes to the immigrant diversity which enriches and strengthens them so much for being so rude and insulting.  Canada didn&rsquo;t exactly live up to its motto, &#8220;Beggers Should Be Choosers,&#8221; with that little fit of arrogance.</p>

		<p>Canada needs to develop an equivalent to E-Verify. And then pass stiff penalties for employers and landlords who hire and rent to illegals. Without a job or place to stay they&rsquo;ll leave on their own.</p>

		<p>The problem is, things have gotten so far away from reality by the lefties holding the reins of power for so long in government, the judiciary, the media, and the schools, that these &#8216;failed refugees&rsquo; feel entitled to all Canada has to offer, and the government feels that its only option is to bribe them with thousands of dollars and whine for their pity. A strong government performing its duty for its citizenry, would round up foreign scofflaws and n&rsquo;er-do-wells, demand they pay for their own ticket home, and slam the door behind them. </p>
<p>Sad thing is, as much as we shake our heads at Canada for being overly left, in some ways, they are miles ahead of us to the right. Could you even imagine the US government trying, even through weak-wristed methods like this, to remove immigrants who are a burden to the state? Even the Republican presidents push instead for blanket amnesty.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s MORE than generous or fair.  There are places in Canada where, if a Canadian went there asking for help from welfare to set up with a job and apartment, s/he will be told that there&rsquo;s nothing for them there, and that all they can do is give you a bus ticket out to the place of your choice and maybe $40 for food.  Sault Ste Marie, Ontario has been like this for ages.  British Columbia was like that under Ujjal Dosanjh.  These are just two I know of personally, I&rsquo;m sure other hard-luck Canadians might have similar stories from other places.</p>
<p>Why should foreigners expect any better?  $2k is LOTS in a third-world country, especially with the CAN$ so strong.  </p>

<p>So genuine refugees, like White South Africans and Rhodesians, who are in fear of their lives, and who would actually ADD to the economy,  should have no problem being accepted in Canada? </p>

		<p>I wasn&rsquo;t aware that is was the job of Canada to impress fraudulent refugees. It shouldn&rsquo;t even be an option. Here&rsquo;s the plan, boat or plane, whatever is cheaper, back to wherever they came from. Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;like it&#8221; is a criminal and treated as such. No 2 thousand dollars, either. How&rsquo;s that for a plan?</p>
<p>Canada should impress scammers? Why? Why should Canada strive to please freeloaders and felons?</p>

<p>So Toronto has Hispanics running their refugee systems, and the ride down that familiar &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; has begun. Fraudulent claimants have no right to complain, but the citizens do and should.</p>
<p>I knew a flight attendant years ago who spoke of how safe and peaceful Toronto had been until the immigrants began arriving.  She said that people were shocked at the violence they brought.  But they never did anything about it when they could.  This is what happens when people are to comfortable and smug.</p>

		<p>They come here yet they get roped into dangerous, militant websites like Uhuru and demand reparations and compensation from their &#8220;oppressors&#8221;. They refuse to acknowledge the fact that their African leaders are literally stealing the bread from their mouths but they have the audacity to place the blame on Western nations whose constant presence in their country is unwanted and stinks of &#8220;Imperialism&#8221;. </p>

Of all the many acts in the horror show that we live in, this plainly tells us what awaits when we are a true minority.  This man really fought hard for refuge and almost didn&rsquo;t get it.  The antiwhite fervor if it were to continue, then the white population of North America will face an ethnic cleansing. The fact that we are in a nominal majority today and still find that we are being robbed of our heritage, physically attacked and murdered in ever increasing numbers; that is a glimpse of a future that has been planned for us.  From here on out, the situation for us becomes more desparate, the birth rate a tell, we head down from here.  Oh, not that we haven&rsquo;t been in a death spiral already, as a nation and culture, it&rsquo;s just that increasingly more stories such as this man from SA, forced to the edge of obliteration, will become expected and accepted.  I fear we have little time left. </p>
