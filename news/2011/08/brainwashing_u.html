<h1><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/brainwashing_jOCNScyOQlR1alPfjmiLeL">Brainwashing U</a></h1>

<p>Parents sending children off to college for the first time, beware: Their &#8220;freshman orientation&#8221; is all too likely to include being herded through a &#8220;tunnel of oppression&#8221; to learn about the evils of &#8220;white privilege,&#8221; being lectured about how they&rsquo;re part of a &#8220;rape culture&#8221; or being forced to discuss their sexual identities with complete strangers-before they even meet their first professor.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right: For all we hear about faculty ideological or political bias, campus administrators are often worse when it comes to brainwashing students.</p>
<p>Consider the shocking account from a student trained to be a dorm supervisor-a resident adviser, or RA-at DePauw University in Indiana. One of her first duties last fall was to lead her new students through a house decorated as a &#8220;Tunnel of Oppression,&#8221; where supposedly &#8220;realistic&#8221; demonstrations in each room taught lessons such as how religious parents hate their gay children, Muslims would find no friends on a predominantly non-Muslim campus and overweight women suffer from eating disorders.</p>
<p>Indeed, in her training to become an RA, &#8220;We were told that &#8216;human&rsquo; was not a suitable identity, but that instead we were first &#8216;black,&rsquo; &#8216;white,&rsquo; or &#8216;Asian&rsquo;; &#8216;male&rsquo; or &#8216;female&rsquo;; . . . &#8216;heterosexual&rsquo; or &#8216;queer.&rsquo; We were forced to act like bigots and spout off stereotypes while being told that that was what we were really thinking deep down.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DePauw is no rare case. At least 96 colleges across the country have run similar &#8220;tunnel of oppression&#8221; programs in the last few years.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous re-education program was the University of Delaware&rsquo;s: Every single student in the dorms endured an Orwellian &#8220;treatment&#8221; (the school&rsquo;s word) program to expunge supposedly incorrect beliefs. Delaware demanded that its RAs ask intrusive questions about students&rsquo; sexual identity and write reports about their responses while lecturing students on environmentalism and telling them that &#8220;citizenship&#8221; required them to recognize that &#8220;systemic oppression exists in our society.&#8221;</p>
