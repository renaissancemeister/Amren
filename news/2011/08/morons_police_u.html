<p>Hmmm . . . three African refugees try to sneak a fake bomb taped to a cellphone onto a plane at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, and police aren&rsquo;t sure of the motive. Doesn&rsquo;t everyone carry a fake bomb in their carry on luggage at the airport? What could possibly be the motive? Ever hear of a dry run, anyone? Or a real, live, actual hijacking using a fake bomb, the way the 9/11 hijackers did it?</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, two of the three African refugees will soon be released into the American population. I can already predict what will happen here. The third dude will also be released, and the authorities will tell us there was a &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; and that it&rsquo;s common for immigrants to tape cellphones to food as gifts for their relatives, just as theDearbornistan Yemeni Muslims claimed when they did the same thing, last year (after lying to authorities about knowing each other). That was bunk, and this is bunk. We know what they are doing and planning. Jihadists are at war with us every single second. Don&rsquo;t you feel safe?</p>
<blockquote><p>Three African refugees were arrested at an Arizona airport after what police described as a fake bomb was found in one of their carry-on bags.</p>
<p>The incident happened last Friday at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.</p>
<p>Investigators said the device was not a bomb but they are concerned the suspects were conducting a trial run to see if they could get a real bomb through security.</p>
<p>Luwiza Daman, a 51-year-old woman from Ethiopia, had the suspicious item in her carry-on bag as she tried to get through security. She told investigators that an acquaintance gave her the item to be delivered to a friend in Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<p>The acquaintance, identified as 25-year-old Shullu Gorado of Eritrea, said the package was Ethiopian food with a cell phone strapped to it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yup, I always strap my food to a cellphone, don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know that you could not send food to the airport, that this was illegal. It was just regular food I bought from the store,&#8221; said Gorado.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, &#8220;regular food&#8221; taped to a cell phone. Yup, that&rsquo;s normal. Not suspicious at all.</p>
<blockquote><p>A third man, 34-year-old Shani Asa of Eritrea, was also arrested in connection with the incident. According to police, Asa admitted to attaching the cell phone to the container of food.</p>
<p>Police have not identified the Des Moines contact who was supposed to receive the item.</p>
<p>Authorities said they do not have a motive yet but have not ruled out terrorism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ya think? Wow, we are dealing with a whole crew of Einsteins here.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re taking it seriously, not just because of the substance they were trying to take on board a plane, but also the 10-year anniversary of 9/11 and the proximity of that date to now,&#8221; Phoenix police Sgt. Steve Martos said.</p>
<p>Daman, Gorado and Asa all have been booked into Maricopa County jail on a charge of having a hoax device and conspiracy to obtain a hoax device. More charges may be filed as the investigation continues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put too much faith in this &#8220;investigation.&#8221; Like I noted, they already released two of them, and last year, they released the two Yemeni men who did the same thing.</p>
<p>We are doomed. America . . . desperate but not serious.</p>
