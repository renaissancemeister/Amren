<h1>Marine Corps Commandant Vows to Boost Number of Black Officers</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Walker, North County Times, August 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The commandant of the Marine Corps vowed Tuesday to increase the number of black officers, improve minority recruiting and memorialize the service&rsquo;s first black troops.</p>
<p>Gen. James Amos told about 500 members of the National Naval Officers Association meeting in San Diego that he was &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; when he examined the status of blacks in the Marine Corps shortly after becoming commandant last fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re just not there,&#8221; the 64-year-old four-star general said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not the face of society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amos, who became the 35th commandant on Oct. 22, said black officers numbered 5.6 percent of the total number of officers in 2010.</p>
<p>The general said that although blacks make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, they comprise 10 percent of the 202,000-troop Marine Corps.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a quota I&rsquo;m after, but I&rsquo;ve got to pay attention to the numbers,&#8221; Amos told the naval officers association, a group made up mostly of U.S. Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard officers. &#8220;I just know I&rsquo;m not happy with where we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re changing our entire approach,&#8221; he said, striding across the floor of a hotel ballroom as he made his remarks. &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to improve this year, next year and the year after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The diversity campaign also reaches into the Marine Corps&rsquo; past by elevating the story of the Montford Marines, a group of 20,000 blacks who were the first to join the Marine Corps when the service opened its doors to minorities in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Amos said it was shameful that the Marine Corps segregated those men into a separate boot camp established at Montford Point at North Carolina&rsquo;s Camp Lejeune, where it operated from 1942-49 when the service integrated its recruit training.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said he is instituting their story into training at all levels, making it required reading for all Marines and working with the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to see they are awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is job No. 1 with me and we&rsquo;re going to make it happen,&#8221; said Amos, who on Saturday spoke to the Montford Point Marine Association&rsquo;s annual gathering in Atlanta.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Later this month, about 200 Montford Marines are being feted by Amos at a three-day gathering in Washington. Events include a parade in their honor and a videotape interview with each so their individual stories are preserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a rich part of our history and our legacy and it won&rsquo;t be forgotten,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>What a crock. I was at Camp Lejeune, N.C. in 1968/69 when they changed the requirements for OCS. Whites had to have a GT score of 120 (think IQ), blacks only needed a 110. I also remember the race riots and drugs from our wonderful diverse establishment.<br>

<p>Hate to be cynical, but what exactly was their contribution toward the war effort? I mean, aside from just being the first black marines, did they do anything worthy of note?  I do recall reading that some of them, as occupation forces in Japan, engaged in rape of civilians, but nothing more.</p>

		<p>At least he&rsquo;s honest about it. It gets ridiculous when he goes on and on about &#8216;the shameful treatment of segregated troops. Then again, when you think about it, being kept away from black troops all those years, aren&rsquo;t white Marines the ones who suffered the most&hellip; .</p>
<p>Announcing the marine corps is only 10% black could a a back-handed recruitment ad of some kinds, for youngsters of all races. </p>

		<p>Thank you General Amos, you&rsquo;ve just signed the death warrant for the once-proud Corps. Now watch it slide into a bunch of bungling buglers who couldn&rsquo;t carry a tune in a bushel basket. And this is his job #1 priority? What happened to a few good men?<br>

		<p>Marine Commandant General James Amos is EXACTLY the kind of white officer who vaults through the ranks in today&rsquo;s military.  But as fervent as he is about diversity, he&rsquo;s got a ways to go to top the Army Chief of Staff who was able to utter these immortal words immediately after a diversity-induced calamity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our diversity, not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.  And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that&rsquo;s worse.&rdquo; The remarks of Army Chief of Staff General W. George Casey, Jr. three days after Major Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 U. S. soldiers and wounded 32 more on Nov. 5, 2009. (&ldquo;General Casey: Diversity Shouldn&rsquo;t be Casualty of Fort Hood,&rdquo; Reuters, Nov. 8, 2009) <br>

		<p>You can&rsquo;t defend a First World country with a Third World army.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect much for our future prospects.  Whites allow and support Diversity over Defense, so Whites don&rsquo;t deserve defending.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s to admire about Whites? </p>
<p>European Whites are giving their nations away to Arab Muslims.  Why admire them?  </p>
<p>And we American Whites are giving away our nation to Arab Muslims, African Voodoos, and Mexican Bandits.  Why admire us?  Why try saving us?  </p>
<p>Look at White America.  Don&rsquo;t you see mostly degraded and immoral culture?  Drugs, divorce, illegitimacy, mongrelization, pornography, endless video games and sports, celebrity worship, total debasement, and $14,500,000,000,000 national debt. </p>
<p>What conclusion can you come to other than that White America is intentionally unfitting itself for anything but slavery?</p>
<p>The amazing fact is that we aren&rsquo;t in chains already.  </p>
<p>And what about those White Marines who are agreeing to let themselves be passed over for promotion of rank so that a black can bless the Corps with Diversity?   If Whitey doesn&rsquo;t speak up on his own behalf, they why should we care that he&rsquo;s dispossessed of his deserved rank?<br>

		<p>James Amos should put his money where his mouth is and give up his job so that a Black person can take his spot. Since he loves &#8220;diversity&#8221; so much, he should put &#8220;diversity&#8221; above his job security for the good of the leftist cause.</p>

		<p>He has to do this.  If he doesn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;ll be replaced by someone who says they will.  This is just the continuance of the &#8220;end of the beginning&#8221; though, as we already have Muslims who receive conscientious objector status based on the possibility of killing other muslims in combat. Next, should we face wider conflict, it will be Blacks refusing to kill Blacks in Africa and Asians refusing to kill Asians, etc.  Lastly, and just before the end, Whites will finally (and thankfully) refuse to kill other Whites.  At that point, we&rsquo;ll break apart as the entho-religious groups engage in conflict with each other.  The America we end up with will be White, but it will be in a much smaller area than that which with we started, and with enemies all around.  Dark ages here we come.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Heartbreaking,&#8221; &#8220;Shameful&#8221;&hellip; This man sure does spend a lot of his time fretting over the past. Does he think the founding and colonization of this country was also &#8220;shameful&#8221; because it involved the displacement of one people by another? If he could wave a wand to make it never happen, would he do it?</p>

		<p>This guy has his head buried in the PC sand. I was in the Navy back in the early 70&rsquo;s, was around a lot of marines, and believe me the military would be better off segregated. This general is the type of guy who would take a thug out of the ghetto without even a high school education and make him an officer. And I wonder if he is also &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; about all the black on white assaults and rapes that take place in the Marine Corps and Navy. Like so many high ranking officers, he is blind to what really goes on in &#8220;the field&#8221;. </p>

<p>But yet I&rsquo;d bet the good general probably has no problem watching sporting events that are upwards of 50% black and seeing that most government employees are black. Why doesn&rsquo;t the 13% rule apply there?</p>
<p>*&ldquo;That is job No. 1 with me and we&rsquo;re going to make it happen,&rdquo;</p>
<p>No General James, you&rsquo;re &#8220;job No. 1&#8221; is suppose to be to protect this country and its interests with the most QUALIFIED people! If you&rsquo;re so determined to &#8220;make it happen&#8221;, then why not lead by example and step down so a more deserving black man can be a general - after all I dought that 13% of the generals in the Marines are black. You can do YOUR part to make the generals of the Marines become the &#8220;face of society&#8221;! Oh and after you nobly step down, make sure the neighborhood you settle in is at least 13% black also. Come on General James, &#8220;make it happen&#8221;!<br>
The thought of useful idiots such as this spineless White BOY being a general in the armed forces is one of the reasons I have trouble going to sleep at night. <br>

		<p>As the United States Marine Corps is arguably the most functional and proud traditional organization left, it has been targeted by the PC police. The good General is now in place who can stand in front of a group of officers and state that he does not support racial &ldquo;quotas&rdquo;, only &ldquo;numbers&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The oaths of office are different between the enlisted and officer ranks. Here is the enlisted oath:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the officer oath:</p>
<p>&#8220;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.&#8221;</p>
<p>So one thing the United States has going for it is that in comparison with 1930s Germany, when the German military had to pledge an oath to a singular man, our officers are expected to use their own judgment when considering the Constitutional legality of an order. The guys who wrote these oaths were pretty sharp.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard as the marines already require the lowest asvab score(a minimum of 25, the last time I checked).</p>
<p>Then again, I recall seeing a mexican girl and a black man actually scoring below 30 as I was sitting in a naval recruitment office(this was before the naval academy scores scandal).  This is a test I scored an 89 on after being out of high school for two years and doing random minimum wage jobs that required zero brain activity - you could pass it with a middle school education.</p>
<p>Guess they&rsquo;ll have to take a page out of the navy&rsquo;s book and start letting in blacks who score several hundred points lower in everything than whites.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m an honorably discharged veteran who served before and under Ronald Reagan and I remember every recruit petty officer position in my boot camp company gifted to black recruits simply because they were on affirmative action scholarships that I had no access to because of my race. After boot camp, us non-blacks went to our A school training and the affirmative action blacks began a special program (not OCS) to prepare to become officers. By the time I got out of A school and was heading toward my first permanent command. Not one of those recruit petty officers remained in the officer training program. In hindsight, it would have been better had they given it to me. Someone who would have successfully navigated my way through it and put it to good use. I might have made the military a career instead of simply taking my honorable discharge after one tour and heading to work and college to finish my education on my own. But that&rsquo;s how it goes in America. </p>

		<p>Ha, ha, this general is headed for a REAL education!!!  As one who has taught in the public schools and is familiar with the average intelligence level of the lower class black, General Jarhead is going to find out that a large percentage of his black &#8220;recruits&#8221; won&rsquo;t make it through boot camp; they&rsquo;ll cry &#8220;racism&#8221; when they&rsquo;re discharged, and make the General&rsquo;s life generally miserable.  The Marines have nicied up their boot camp to the point that it&rsquo;s pretty namby-pamby compared to what it was 40 years ago.  I have a friend whose platoon screwed up at graduation from boot camp and marched badly in front of all the brass and the families.  So the DI took every member of that platoon, one by one, into the bunkhouse and punched him in the face, breaking his jaw.  The men got the required medical treatment and nothing further was said.  Harsh?  Yup.  But the Marines are the first to go in to ANY combat situation, and have to be able to withstand pain and deprivation beyond what the men &amp; women of the other branches of service have to handle.  Good luck, General.  You aren&rsquo;t getting any &#8220;bruthas&#8221; who can deal with anything like that.</p>

<p>I used to translate the difference in the enlisted and officer oath as follows:</p>
<p>Enlisted men are expected to do their duty.<br>
Officers are expected to know their duty.</p>

		<p>From the article - Gen. James Amos told about 500 members of the National Naval Officers Association meeting in San Diego that he was &ldquo;heartbroken&rdquo; when he examined the status of blacks in the Marine Corps shortly after becoming commandant last fall.</p>
<p>My, my, the good general is &#8220;heartbroken&#8221; over the status of Blacks in the Marine Corps (pronounced &#8220;corpse&#8221; according to our idiot president). </p>
<p>God help us, aren&rsquo;t there any men left in the higher ranks of the military? What a wuss, what a sissy. why Gen. Amos, you are a  veritable eunuch! </p>
<p>Not to mention that you&rsquo;re a traitor to your country. </p>

		<p>As always, one needs to accentuate the positive. In <i>Civil War II</i> Tom Chittum predicted the racial fracturing of the US military. As we AR denizens are aware, the  elite troops (Army Rangers, Navy SEALs, etc.) are almost all white. So when the crackup happens those battle-tested whites will be going against untrained, undisciplined blacks under the &#8220;leadership&#8221; of the incompetent quota-fillers Gen. Amos wants to appoint. &#8220;Annihilation&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t even begin to describe the inevitable outcome.</p>
<p>Like WASP (#17), I was in the military before and during Reagan&rsquo;s presidency (Air Force, in my case). It&rsquo;s amazing how different things were back then. The 1980s USAF was as color-blind as humans could make it. Everyone was treated (or mistreated) exactly the same. No affirmative action, no quotas, no race-norming of promotion tests, no nothing. Even mentioning a person&rsquo;s race on his/her job performance review form was strictly forbidden. As a result, everyone got along and race was irrelevant. In fact, my USAF experience delayed my racial awakening   &mdash;   which happened soon after I left.</p>
<p>I find it ironically appropriate that someone named &#8220;Amos&#8221; would spout this nonsense. What&rsquo;s needed now is a second-in-command named &#8220;Andy&#8221; to act as his co-spouter; then the irony would be complete.</p>

		<p>In WWI my father was in the pacific in the navy.  They gave him marine equipment and a rifle as sent him in as reinforcements in a see saw battle for an air field.  Finally a black antiaircraft unit showed up and peace reigned with the defeat of the Japanese.  Next thing you know the black folk are exploding shells in the white tenting area and have killed their officers.  White marines took care of business.  Bet their is no record of this available to the public</p>

		<p>Let blacks and other non-Whites fight other non-Whites 9,000 miles away.  It is not in the best interests of Whites to &#8220;defend, uphold or support&#8221; a government that actively demonizes them and is working for their demise.</p>

<p>Yes!  Excellent comment!</p>
<p>Notice his age.  If the military is like the schools, as I suspect it it, the General works in an absolute, strictly enforced, Orwellian Reign of Terror where one must carefully measure every single word he utters lest the PC enforcers are listening.</p>
<p>I suspect he&rsquo;s counting down the days until he can get out and wants to make sure his pension and reputation are secure.  I can only imagine what he says behind closed doors as he well knows the limitations and deficiencies of blacks and has surely watched qualified Whites repeatedly passed over for promotion in favor of unqualified blacks.  The military, like the schools, is famous for doing this   &mdash;   after all, we answer to the PC enforcers themselves&hellip;    the government!!</p>

<p><i>Shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard as the marines already require the lowest ASVAB score (a minimum of 25, the last time I checked).</i></p>
<p>This memo came across my bow the other day, sent to me by a school administrator who told me he didn&rsquo;t send it and doesn&rsquo;t know me. Sent as the clock was striking 13!!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest &#8220;crises&#8221; in education!:</p>
<p><i>A recent analysis by the Education Trust shows that a substantial percentage of high school graduates do not meet the minimum academic standards to join the US Army. This statement is based on standardized test results on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB).</i></p>
<p><i>By federal law, people scoring at the low end are prohibited from entering the military– no exceptions.</i></p>
<p><i>Each service has minimum standards for entry. For the Army and most other services, the minimum standard is an AFQT percentile score of 31. In reality, the services are not enthusiastic about applicants that score close to the minimum.</i> </p>
<p><i>Persons of color are less likely to meet minimum standards than whites. <br>
Persons of color who qualify for military enlistment have fewer job and training choices because they have lower scores on the ASVAB.</i> </p>
<p><i>Three additional important criteria are behavior, fitness and high school graduation.</i> </p>
<p><b>The Pentagon reports that 75 % of those aged 17 to 24 do not even qualify to take the ASVAB because they are physically unfit, have a criminal record, or didn&rsquo;t graduate from high school!</b></p>
<p><i>Persons with criminal records are prohibited from joining the military</i></p>
<p>The memo goes on to say that this is (of course) the fault of the schools and especially teachers who &#8220;aren&rsquo;t preparing our young people, particularly young people &#8216;of color&rsquo; for entry into either the military or civilian job force.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Black marines in WWII were assigned to mostly defense battalions. These defended islands long after the Japanese were wiped out. Others were assigned to supply companies. These actually took part in combat. They carried supplies to the beachhead on Iwo Lima and Peluiku. <br>
   These were jobs that had to be done, but not the most challenging tasks that the corps had.</p>

<p>I can well recall this was an issue several decades ago now on &#8220;Sixty Minutes&#8221;. General Mundy the Commandant was being interviewed about the lack of black general officers in the Marines. Was only one at the time. Mundy said: &#8220;THEY don&rsquo;t swim as well, THEY don&rsquo;t shoot a rifle as well, THEY don&rsquo;t follow a course on the ground from a map as well&#8221;. THEY! Mundy looked REALLY bad and stupid and just did not seem how realize how stupid he looked. I am sure the man was not dumb but he was &#8220;OUT&#8221; of it. And later he must have been told of how bad he looked because he tried to make amends but the damage was done.</p>

If they did not wave these scores there would be almost ni blacks in the Corps at all.</p>

<p>There was a Major that was the CO of maintenance company that had a GT score of 75 and a PhysEd degree. Most blacks are in the 60s.</p>
<p>When I enlisted as a high school drop out I had to have a minimum GT of 110 (mine was not that low) a HS grad needed 100.</p>

 <br>
I couldn&rsquo;t figure out why. She is at the top of the totem pole as far as minorities are concerned. There are so many opportunities for her. If she wanted to be an officer in the United States Navy, she would just need average grades to get into Annapolis. She is the prime recipient of all AA jobs and opportunities. She could enroll at an prestigious university and be admitted over white people with superior grades. If she went to high school she would not even have to show up the majority of the time. </p>
<p>Blacks get things handed to them on a silver platter and they are still not happy. </p>

		<p>Anyone remember with fondness the race riots aboard naval vessels at duty station during the 70s?  Yes it was a lovely time to be a white officer.  These ticket punchers have been in control of our mil services for some time now.  The difference is the Gen. Amos style is to turn a complete blind eye to reality in trade for a better retirement.  His traitorous behavior is not without companions. Many got their start in the Carter years and of course could we forget what the Clintons did for the services.</p>
<p>This is an intentional effort to collapse the nation&rsquo;s support elements.  Make no mistake about it, the nation&rsquo;s police and mil services are what have kept us still intact for the last few decades.  The Southern Poverty Law Center is assisting in deconstructing the police and now this PC/communist crap is being served up in the mil.  You think that the one day wouldn&rsquo;t come when the services would be turned against us?  Think again, as someone said, this is the end of the beginning.  Two of my children wanted to follow their ancestors in honorable service to this country but with these prospects and the homosexual celebrations to come, well, they can do w/o my children.   </p>

<p>Reminds me of the baseball &#8220;hero&#8221;,  Jackie Robinson.  He gets inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame just for being Black.  His MLB career statistics in no way reflect the accomplishments of a Hall of Famer, but he gets in because he did what some other Black player would have eventually done anyway.</p>
<p>When are they going to start handing out Congressional Medals of Honor to White police officers who put their lives on the line everyday combatting Black violence and criminality?  After all, a police officer in the average U.S. city is more likely to die in the line of duty than a soldier is serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

		<p>Old Vet #24, well said. This comes from an &#8220;Air Force Brat&#8221;; a child raised in the most patriotic, responsible, and well educated lifestyle that existed in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. I am the daughter of a career Air Force father who served at the tail end of WW II, in Korea &amp; Viet Nam. He was, at the time he was promoted, the 4th youngest E-9 in the Air Force and had over 15 years in grade when he retired with 30 years. In other words, no slouch; no sorry, good-for-nothing equal opportunity hire. He is now spinning in his urn at what has become of this formerly great country. I&rsquo;m glad he&rsquo;s not here to see it.</p>
<p>I, too am of the mindset that there is nothing left here to defend, and soon there will be an equally abysmal force to defend it. The quality of the U.S. military has sunk to new, jaw-dropping lows. The slime of society is often given a choice of going to jail or going to the military. Most of the rest are joining strictly to fund a college education to try to amount to something.</p>
<p>The requirements for acceptance have been reduced virtually to having a pulse. Even then, a disturbing percentage of them cannot manage to pass the lowered standards. The U.S. military has denigrated itself to accommodate the lack of quality recruits brought about by needing to fill positions since the end of the draft.</p>
<p>There are still &#8216;a few good men&rsquo;(and fewer good women) who have the best of their nation at heart, but just like public school today, they are held back due to the forced inclusion of and administration by lazy, useless &#8216;diversicants&rsquo;. At this stage, the quality of the U.S. military actually does reflect the quality of its people. And unless something changes drastically and quickly, neither are worth saving. I&rsquo;m sorry, daddy.</p>

		<p>unfortunately it&rsquo;s been coming since at least the 1970&rsquo;s - I was in the USN late 70&rsquo;s thru mid 80&rsquo;s - every eval we had threw in the Orwellian wording (paraphrasing here): &#8220;__ supports equal opportunity - supports equal rights for all.&#8221; which we &amp; our chief signed (woe unto anyone who refused) it seemed like a harmless little add-on, but that thinking continued to expand. ASVAB scores accurately predict performance for all groups - no matter what group one is from - if one scores low, they&rsquo;ll likely be a poor recruit &amp; drop out before their enlistment is up. Blacks on average score lower on ASVAB, on average shoot worse, on average read maps worse, etc. In an effort to be PC, less competent ones get promoted to ranks where they are out of their league. Then bad things will happen, &amp; cover-ups ensue.</p>

		<p>I was in the Service from &#8216;68-&#8216;72 and in Vietnam in &#8216;69 in the Mekong Delta (TF-116 RivRon 59) on a PBR.</p>
<p>We were all volunteers. There was no affirmative action, no women, no gays, no &#8216;underserved perpetually oppressed&rsquo;&hellip; no nothing.</p>
<p>When I was there, Adm. Zumwalt (and his later, famous Z-grams) was ComNavForV (i.e. my &#8216;boss&rsquo;). When I got back to the world, he became CNO in &#8216;70. He&rsquo;s the one who started this whole 40+ year decline of the Military. He instituted all kinds of orders to reduce what he perceived as &#8216;institutional racism and sexism&rsquo; in the Navy (along with all kinds of other dictats, allowing a relaxing of all kinds of standards). Needless to say, all the old salts hated him. After he left the Service in &#8216;74, he unsuccessfully ran for Congress in &#8216;76 (as a Democrat, of course).</p>
<p>As a sidenote, his close subordinate in &#8216;Nam, Jeremy Boorda (also a CNO) committed suicide in &#8216;96, because he was caught wearing unauthorized commendations.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2005. Marine Gen. Peter Pace (also a &#8216;Nam Vet - and a great guy) became JCS. He was adamantly opposed to the Military succumbing to the &#8216;Gay Agenda&rsquo;. Because of that, SecDef Gates threw him under the bus in 2007 by advising the President not to renominate Pace for a second term and Gen. Pace retired after <b>40 years</b> of service.</p>
<p>One by one, through the decades, the old-timers were pushed out to make way for the new, &#8216;oh-so-tolerant&rsquo; leaders we have today. This is why we have &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, women everywhere, gays, etc., etc. - just like in the civilian world.</p>
<p>The Military is NOT a social experiment. Our job was and is to kill enemies and break things. One day, sooner than I had ever thought, America will be a 2nd rate power, militarily, economically and socially. All we&rsquo;ll have left is our nukes (unless The Messiah successfully unilaterally disarms us).</p>
<p>VOTE in 2012. VOTE for anything that moves. Hell, VOTE for anything, even if it doesn&rsquo;t move. If this dictator gets back in, you can kiss whatever remains of our culture goodbye.</p>

		<p>Who is surprised by this? The US military is and has been one huge bastion of Cultural Marxism for years now (at the official levels of course). Moreover, if they want more Blacks to go off and fight these foolish wars all over the Middle East, etc., which are of no benefit to White people&hellip;then I say, be as &#8220;diverse&#8221; as you like! </p>

		<p>I have read quite a few posts in numerous blogs which say, more or less, that to volunteer and serve in today&rsquo;s military is a sure sign you need your head examined. It seems the American military is seeking out the strange and alienated to serve, and is rewarding the country with losses overseas in strange and pointless adventures. The borders of the country are being overrun by Mexican bandits but never mind the Afghans are learning to read Anti-American hate literature.</p>

		<p>Why should the Corps be &#8220;the face of society&#8221;?  The Corps should be comprised of a few good men, and the officers corps should be fewer better men.  If certain people don&rsquo;t make the grade then they should not be officers.</p>
<p>The way they are doing it, our military will be fully defeatable by 2020.</p>

		<p>My son and I served in the Corps; he served three combat tours in Iraq and is a real hero. I served in the early 70&rsquo;s. We know from experiece that combat troops in the Corps are made up of White boys and Tex Mex. Always has been. If Amos wants to honor a group of minority Marines that have contributed far beyond their numbers, he need only book a flight to south Texas. By-the-way, a Marine must volunteer to serve in the infantry, unlike that other service. Ain&rsquo;t happening with young black males. Not gonna get shot at.  </p>

		<p>Shame on General Amos for leaving his spine at the door.  So much for looking at senior military officers as heroes and role models.</p>
<p>The article doesn&rsquo;t tell you but the National Naval Officers Association (NNOA) is part of the &ldquo;diversity-pimping&rdquo; industry that uses taxpayer&rsquo;s money to push a racist agenda.  It is a racist organization focusing on black membership and ensuring that Black officers are given special preference, based on race, over other officers.  Go to their website and look at the bios for the board of directors.  Show me any diversity in the board&rsquo;s composition other than Black.</p>
<p>General Amos knows why there are low numbers of Black officers and black enlisted in the Marine Corps, he just won&rsquo;t tell you why.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that Blacks make up 13% of the population or even that they make up 10.5% of the civilian labor force (age 16 and above including immigrants).  What matters is the group of people who are qualified to be commissioned officers (age 21-27, college graduate, Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) score of 74 with a General Technical (GT) score of 110) or enlisted (17-25, high school graduate, ASAVB score of 32 or higher). </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at officers. According to the Secretary of the Navy, Blacks compose 9.8% of college graduates. Based on a literacy assessment done by the American Institute of Research, only 13% of Black college graduates test at a proficient (college) level.  Approximately 58% test somewhere between a 9th and 12th grade level and 30% test at 8th grade and below (This compares with 42% of Whites and 22% of Hispanics testing as proficient). So less than 2% of Black college graduates should even be considered for officer selection. That is why the military requires college graduates to take the ASVAB. Since the 1970&rsquo;s, ASVAB and GT scores required for commissioning have been lowered (in the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s the GT score was 120-125).</p>
<p>Now, look at enlisted. The Marines require a high school diploma and an ASVAB score of 32 (Army goes to 30) for enlistment.  Not every graduate is eligible for enlistment. Only about 25% of young men and women in the age range of 17-27 are eligible before they take the ASVAB. 39% of Blacks taking the test don&rsquo;t get even the minimum score of 31. 52% score in the lowest category open for enlistment (equal to an 8th to 9th grade education). The Marines currently have 10% enlisted who are Black. If the Marines used the Air Force-required ASVAB scores (40) or the Coast Guard-required (45), the percentage would be much, much lower since the mean ASVAB score for Blacks is 38 (versus 55 for Whites and 44 for Hispanics).</p>
<p>So, the number of Blacks eligible to come into the Marines, either officer or enlisted, are significantly smaller than the 13% the US population which is Black. The other military services and industry also compete for these same, very reduced numbers.  Finally, regardless of race, someone has to want to be a Marine and meet the Corps high standards for performance and accountability. It isn&rsquo;t easy to be a Marine. With so many choices available to the population f Blacks who can do anything they like, many simply don&rsquo;t want the rigor and accountability that comes with being a Marine.</p>
<p>General Amos knows these numbers.  He knows the facts why there aren&rsquo;t more Blacks in the Marines.  He just didn&rsquo;t have the guts to tell the truth to an audience he had no business addressing in the first place.  Of all the Services, the Marine Corps has been the most color blind.  Now, like the other Services, it is now suspect. Every time one sees a Black officer or enlisted there will be the question &ldquo;Were they qualified to be a Marine (or to be promoted) or were they simply quota fillers?&rdquo;<br>

		<p>&#8220;blacks make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, they comprise 10 percent of the 202,000-troop Marine Corps&#8221;</p>
<p>A 3% difference means we&rsquo;re not there yet, and is a call to action and job one? When you consider blacks are apparently 5.6% of the officer corps and if officers comprise 15% of Marines, blacks may be over represented among enlisted personal. And don&rsquo;t forget, a one or two percent discrepancy is a big deal. </p>
<p>This is really about rewards and the good things. It&rsquo;s about the officer corps (outside any white-guilt that can be planted). There&rsquo;s no push to even out places where whites have a disadvantage or where their numbers are low. Or where they can&rsquo;t be found at all.   </p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing this guy is in charge of the &#8216;diversity&rsquo; program. Sounds like he&rsquo;d have a tough time making a post on AmRen.</p>

<p>it never ends with quotas.  It always turns into a not Whites need apply policy.  Just stroll into any state, local or federal government office in the country.</p>
<p>Now that the Whites who got their jobs prior to 1968 have retired, it is nothing but non Whites of every kind.</p>
<p>Blacks are 800 percent over quota in federal employment.</p>
<p>In my county, which has 10 percent blacks according to the 2000 census, county employment is 38 percent black.  The hispanics are suing however, which means that competent people will soon take the place of the dysfunctional blacks. </p>

Had I been there, I would have asked him &#8220;So General, what is it about the past and current Marine Corps that disappoints you so?

		<p>Amos is a pathetic sycophant. And the proof is you do not get to be Commandant of the Marine Corps without being bright enough to know there are just not many blacks of the caliber the Corps requires who are volunteering for the Corps or ever will. The facts are even more obvious for elite services like the Seals.  Statistics simply reveal the more any group is in combat the fewer blacks are to be found.</p>

<p>Combat arms Army MOS&rsquo;s are volunteer as well. As a Iraq war 19D (scout) I know this. Army combat arms units are made up of whites and Tex-mex as well. The &#8220;support&#8221; units are full of blacks and self-hating white women looking to sleep around. But around 10% of the army is combat arms. </p>

		<p> What is really sad in reguards to the monfort point marines is that these men where of a differant generation of black americans, a better group if there ever was one,if you asked me there are many today tlike them, LTC West comes to mind, and despite the discremination, and there was, they rose above it, and made the most of their lives, they served proudly and did;nt ask for any special favors, and when they left the service they where better for it,the majority of this class of blacks went on to do good in there lives,MARRYING and having a family with their children continuing in this, you can bet that they do not approve of all the stuff that the others have been up to,indeed it is this very group of blacks that became target #1 for immerging class of black and hispanic low lives. </p>

		<p>Has anyone thought about the real possibility that the reason why non-whites are being promoted over whites in the officer corps is the run up to another Soviet style massacre of whites? You can bet when ordered to, non-whites will be all too happy to kill us en masse. The hostile ethnic and religious aliens who really run this country are already doing everything to remove our very existance and contributions to history and civilization when they are not demonizing us. They are training non-whites to regard us as objects of hate, contempt and violent rage, not to mention envy and jealousy. This will ensure that whites will regard all non-whites as their enemies and will backfire when they seek out and kill the ones who started the violence, genocide and oppression against us in the first place. We should resort to scorched Earth warfare to leave nothing for the non-whites, just as my Ukrainian kulak ancestors burned their crops, killed all their livestock and destroyed their equipment and buildings too in response to the Bolsheviks dispossessing and murdering them.</p>

		<p>You can read the books about the fall of the Roman Empire and it is a blueprint of what we see now. The primary difference is that the pace is much quicker. Look up the battle of Adrianople (currently Erdine, Turkey). I guess that in 376 AD, the Goths were allowed in &#8220;Because they would do the jobs that Roman citizens won&rsquo;t do&#8221;. </p>
<p>Do you really want a bunch of military versions of Wesley Mouch (Atlas Shrugged) running the show? As with #22 Strider, when I first joined, there was still the possibility of advancement through merit. There were motivated minorities and derelict whites, but political correctness had not destroyed the military. There were still a lot of Vietnam vets still running around at that time. Those days are long gone. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m  sure that General Amos will not line up a high paying position with some military contractor if he goes out and tells the truth. </p>

		<p>I went through Marine Corps OCS in 1998.  There were many blacks in my training platoon, but very few finished the program.  Interestingly, most left the program or were kicked out for not being able to run.  Marine Corps OCS emphasizes physical fitness, largely through long marches and runs.  The academic standards are very low.  But you cannot have an officer reach an objective and be too physically exhausted to consider and give proper orders.  Most of the blacks in America originate from Western Africa.  They are heavily muscled, but terrible distance runners (sprinters, not marathoners).  The general would have to remove the running from OCS, or have a double-standard between black and white candidates, to get more blacks through the system.</p>
