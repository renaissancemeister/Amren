<h1>Urban Outfitters Board Denounced for Refusal to Include Women or Minorities</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nadra Kareem, Change, August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>You&rsquo;d think a corporation that owns multiple brands catering solely to women would have a female-heavy board of directors. But for clothing giant Urban Outfitters Inc.  &mdash;  which owns Free People, Anthropologie, and BHLDN  &mdash;  the opposite is true. Seven people serve on the company&rsquo;s board of directors. Guess how many are women: None.</p>
<p>Guess how many are people of color: None.</p>
<p>In May, Calvert Investments, which promotes socially responsible investing, urged Urban Outfitters to consider including women and minorities on its board in the future. The result? Urban Outfitters rebuffed them, denying that they had a diversity problem, according to Calvert senior analyst Aditi Mohapatra.</p>
<p>{snip} In 2011, that&rsquo;s unacceptable, which is why Mohapatra launched a petition on Change.org demanding that Urban Outfitters diversify its all-male, all-white board.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A board with no women and minorities is an insult to Urban Outfitters&rsquo; diverse clientele. Join organizations such as Calvert and 2020 Women on Boards in letting Urban Outfitters know that an all-white, all-board is unacceptable. {snip}</p>

		<p>So a likely competent and qualified white male employee should step down, why exactly? Do any of these liberal types ever consider the fact that maybe these guys worked hard for years to reach this position and deserve to be there? I personally have no problem with women or minorities in a high ranking job either in the private sector or even the government, but ONLY if they show through years of hard work that they are intelligent, and competent, and deserving of the position. Making a qualified person step down and give up their position to someone less qualified based ONLY on the other persons race or gender just sounds terribly sexist and racist to me.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve got a very simple solution, let a black owned bank or equity firm make an offer to buy out Urban Outfitters. Then they can staff it with all colors, both sexes, people of various sexual orientations, etc. Buy back all of the stock and resell it only to women and &#8220;people of color&#8221;. If this group can run it, more power to them. However, we would more likely see President Obama hand this new firm an endless source of bailout money. </p>
<p>One time on TV, I saw a black woman complaining that &#8220;after 400 years, we don&rsquo;t even have a Walgreens&#8221;. Why is that? I&rsquo;m not aware of any law that states &#8220;Black people are forbidden to own pharmacy chains&#8221;. I guess it is hard to build a supply chain when people boost all of the links. </p>
<p>If the current stockholders believed that green martians could do a better job than the all white male board, wouldn&rsquo;t whitey be out the door? </p>

		<p>If an organization is all female or all colored, it&rsquo;s considered wonderful, diversity, and it&rsquo;s something that must be celebrated. There are even schools and universities made up like that. Even pausing for long enough before celebrating in an enthusiastic enough manner can be considered bigotry. I had a teacher once say all this diversity is about tolerance, period. For the most part, I would say it&rsquo;s about being anti-white male, or hatred of white males. </p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve considered. They don&rsquo;t care. All you are to them is an ATM machine. If you are a mainstream white man, they are utterly indifferent to your fate. If you are not mainstream (i.e. you are poor, working class, lower middle class, from the urban or rural underclass, educationally and socioeconomically disadvantaged, whatever) they want to keep you from getting your foot on the ladder in the first place. What part of &#8220;I hate your guts&#8221; don&rsquo;t you understand? The socially conservative white man in all of his versions is the barrier that stands between then and their dream of a coerced &#8220;ideal&#8221; society. That&rsquo;s why they don&rsquo;t care what you do for your family and community. Or how you have reached out to help other people, including minority group members and women.</p>
<p>Any man (even a minority man) who is not willing to be a cog in their political machine is marked for abuse and possible dispossession.</p>

		<p>At Change.org, merely questioning racial dogma will get you banned.  Take it from me.  The only &#8220;diversity&#8221; they promote there is anti-white diversity.</p>
<p>What I want to know is how many of the founders of Urban Outfitters were &#8220;people of color&#8221; or female?</p>

		<p>Hey Nadra Kareem, why don&rsquo;t you start a clothing company run exclusively by women and/or minorities?</p>
<p>Your company should be just as successful as the ones run by white men since we&rsquo;re all equal under the skin (cough, cough).</p>

		<p>Well if having women and minorities makes a company so well run, why don&rsquo;t these feminist join with blacks and start their clothing company.  Why don&rsquo;t they start their own clothing company and make a fortune?  Ah, no they just want the executive jobs without the risk or long hours.</p>

		<p><i>Urban Outfitters rebuffed them, denying that they had a diversity problem, according to Calvert senior analyst Aditi Mohapatra.</i></p>
<p>In denial about their &#8220;diversity problem&#8221; huh?  Maybe they need to hire an outside &#8220;diversity consultant&#8221; firm that will no doubt work diligently to fix this urgent problem for them (i.e., overpay to recruit minorities and women and fire White men).  </p>
<p>And anonymous at 10:16 PM is exactly right:  If you are a White male they DON&rsquo;T CARE what happens to you (White females are used as pawns to isolate and disenfranchise White males).  White Males have enjoyed hundreds of years of preferences as far as they are concerned; and there is not enough you can give to atone for it.  The supposed &#8220;preferences&#8221; enjoyed by your ancestors  &mdash;  even if indentured servants  &mdash;  still inure to your benefit regardless of present financial circumstances.  You may now work for minimum wage, live in squalor, or starve for all they care. <br>

Bottom of the Barrel: By Old Raleigh Native</p>
<p>Some people just don&rsquo;t understand freedom.   <br>
In a free society, it&rsquo;s the owners of a private business who get to decide who runs the business. – Period.<br>
 For those who don&rsquo;t like certain (lawful) things that a private company does,&hellip; they don&rsquo;t have to BUY anything from that company. Or, they could start their OWN business and hire whom ever THEY choose.<br>
 Besides, why should anyone CARE WHO makes a product if one likes and wants to buy the product? <br>
There is a word for what Nadra Kareem and change.org are trying to do. – EXTORTION.<br>

<p>&#8220;They deny having a diversity problem? Of course they don&rsquo;t have a problem-they are homogeneous.&#8221;</p>

		<p>To Question Diversity #8.</p>
<p>It has been my experience that about the only businesses that blacks can sustain are the following: Liquor stores, convenience stores, barber/beauty/nail salons, fast food, and an undertaker. Black owned banks probably get by with a combination of lower capital requirements and the ability to impose real underwriting standards on their clientele without federal oversight and pressure. </p>
<p>When I was in high school, we bought our booze primarily from black owned stores (via the local version of Otis Campbell). Occasionally we might get a friend who worked at a grocery store to set a case on the back dock and pass him enough for payment and a tip. </p>
<p>A friend of mine who earned his MA in Economics about 20 years ago told me of his experience with a black run organization. This was a quasi government run outfit whose job it was to improve the economic standing of minorities (read blacks, there were virtually no Mexicans in that area then). This was through helping them qualify for loans, giving them strategies for expanding the business and so on. The vast majority of black run businesses were pretty much like whose mentioned above. I think he said that the largest black run &#8220;manufacturing&#8221; operation in that state had 3 full time people and 5 part time who would come in during a busy season. Also a mom and pop business. His boss demanded 12 hour days six to seven days a week and constantly pounded on him for not &#8220;doing his job&#8221;. BTW, he was the only white person working there. I guess the MA in Economics would magically allow him to turn sows ears into silk purses. As soon as a bank came calling, my friend was out of there. </p>
<p>Prior to integration, blacks had plenty of their own businesses. Granted anything beyond a mom and pop operation was rare. But there were exceptions. Look up a guy named S.B. Fuller.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the 1950s, Fuller was probably the richest African American man in the United States. His cosmetics company had $18 million in sales and a sales force of five thousand (one third of them white). It gave training to many future entrepreneurs and other leaders. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;about the color of an individual&rsquo;s skin. No one cares whether a cow is black, red, yellow, or brown. They want to know how much milk it can produce.&rdquo; &#8221; (From Wikipedia)</p>
<p>His downfall started in 1963 when he told the truth. &#8220;Negroes are not discriminated against because of the color of their skin. They are discriminated against because they have not anything to offer that people want to buy.&#8221; </p>
<p>What in the world (besides protection) does Nadra Kareem have to offer?<br>
