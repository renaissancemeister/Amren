	<p>Could a Tottenham happen here? And, if so where?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of 14 large American cities that may be ready to erupt. They have been identified by sorting common social, economic and demographic data including: unemployment, education, income, crime, housing and homelessness.</p>
<p>Other data was also included that might indicate probable &#8220;flash points&#8221; igniting unrest.   These include: cities with especially high rates of reported police misconduct, high disparity between rich and poor, city budget deficits threatening social services, high incidence of hate crime, and large differences in home values between neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>1. Detroit, MI:     </p>
<p>The poster child for what has gone wrong with American capitalism. {snip}</p>

<p>•	56% of residents spend over 35% of their income on housing</p>
<p>•	Percentage of single-parent households: 67.1%</p>
<p>•	Homeless: 1,627/100,000 residents</p>
<p>•	3rd highest U.S. city crime score: 356.44</p>
<p>•	High school graduation rate, public school district: 37.5%</p>
<p>•	Deficit through FY2011: 710,000,000; per capita: $780</p>

<p>•	7th highest U.S. city crime score: 260.60</p>
<p>4. Memphis, TN:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so long ago, Memphis, a city where a majority of the residents are black, was a symbol of a South where racial history no longer tightly constrained the choices of a rising black working and middle class. Now this city epitomizes something more grim: How rising unemployment and growing foreclosures in the recession have combined to destroy black wealth and income and erase two decades of slow progress.&#8221; Source: News One for Black America.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if this is a rank in descending order from most to least likely.  But if it is, I wouldn&rsquo;t put St. Louis above Baltimore, Philadelphia and Newark.  While the &#8220;Knockout King&#8221; game is popular among St. Louis blacks, there really hasn&rsquo;t been anything like a large-scale riot in the entire history of blacks being a presence in St. Louis City.  Blacks here still have a bit of residual fear of &#8220;da man&#8221; and his &#8220;po-leece.&#8221;  Eventually, it will wear off, and then the stuff will really get serious.  But in the short term, not likely.</p>
<p>Where do they get the stat that the city&rsquo;s population swells by almost 35% on workdays?  I doubt it&rsquo;s that high, and a good chunk of that isn&rsquo;t the traditional &#8220;downtown&#8221; St. Louis, it&rsquo;s the city&rsquo;s two large hospital complexes, plus A-B (that is until the wonderful Brazilians that run InBev out of Antwerp or Brussels decide to close the St. Louis brewery, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.).  Most of the job centers in St. Louis are in suburban office parks near freeway junctions.</p>

		<p>CBS Atlanta is reporting that about 25 Atl. police officers had their certifications lapse, meaning that criminal cases will be dismissed, and the city will have fewer police on the beat.</p>
<p>When the riots rage here, don&rsquo;t look for black ruled APD to do much to help.</p>
<p>Whites in Atl. haven&rsquo;t woken up yet, but the murder of Brittney Fox Watts by a Diversity security guard who was being paid to protect her, may have given them a nudge toward reality.</p>
<p>Let the riots come. The AJC will blame Republican redistricting and ignore the obvious.</p>

		<p>Translation:  here are 13 American cities with a large black underclass. (Why the headline says &#8220;14&#8221;, I have no clue.  So let&rsquo;s throw in Oakland.)  &#8220;Black&#8221; is the common denominator.  (I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought that about Cincinnati, but live and learn.)</p>
<p>The rioters happen to be receiving welfare, for the most part.  Ironic?</p>

		<p>black mob loots 7-11 near my house. video link below. this is getting really serious folks. my idea is these are  just trial runs for large scale looting and rioting. they are testing police response. these groups are highly organized seriously white citizens arm yourselves with guns and BUY LOTS OF AMMO.<br>

		<p>Well it&rsquo;s obvious the common bond they all share, even someone with basic common sense could see this coming. They can throw all the statistics they want out there for the cause of it, but in the end it all boils down to just one thing, race. If whites faced the same circumstances they would be looking for ways to improve the situation rather than destroy the town and each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just kids,&#8221; eh?  Oh, yeah.  The real threat is the white commoners.</p>
<p>I saw the video of that flash mob robbery and those &#8220;kids&#8221; were grown thugs, hardly harmless juveniles.</p>
<p>Too, it is &#8220;just kids&#8221; who are attacking non-blacks creating fractures, contusions and in several cases they sent victims to the critical care center.  Yeah, &#8220;just kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>The anchors and reporters at the black T.V. station that showed the video we&rsquo;re telling everyone how awful it was for people to be arming themselves, after all this was &#8220;just kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do blacks ever want to hold their thugs responsible for the crimes they commit?  Best thing to do is release them all in the same neighborhoods these black self-appointed elitists live. </p>

		<p>Wow, this is really stunning! There are compelling similiarities in all of these cities.  However, the stat on single parent homes jumps out.  For examples, Detroit 67.1%//Atlanta 60.4%//Baltimore 59.2%//Cleveland 58.6%, etc., etc. All of the cities named have over 50% of single family homes except Miami which has 44.4%.<br>
Philadelphia and other cities have now developed &#8220;Flash mobs&#8221; that rob and injure people and now require curfew and security cameras.<br>
Can we all say &#8220;Welcome to Obamaland&#8221;.</p>

		<p>There are two reasons Camden, N.J. didn&rsquo;t make the list. The first is there&rsquo;s nothing left there to burn, and or loot and secondly,I&rsquo;m sure they didn&rsquo;t want to put more than one city in for eacgh state. Otherwise Camden would have most certainly made the list.</p>

		<p>My List:</p>
<p>#1 Detroit : All that&rsquo;s wrong with America period. Coddling the anarchists while importing Iranians to take up the slack.</p>
<p># 2 Miami : In 1960 all White and perfectly safe. Today, over 80% Hispanic and drug culture galore. I believe at last count it was all of 7% White only 40 years later.</p>

Now, luckily, most white Americans know that black urban mobs are a whole lot scarier than a bunch of good ole boys and gals.  That includes white liberals.  But, they must lay a groundwork of excuses for the rampaging mobs when they do descend upon these cities.  Half the time these liberals are insisting that the mobs are white, and the other time they&rsquo;re implying they&rsquo;re black by giving the timeworn excuses about financial disparity, etc.  </p>

<i># 5 New Orleans and Buffalo : One needs another hurricane and the other needs another blizzard.</i></p>
<p>Blizzards aren&rsquo;t conducive to riots. It&rsquo;s one good thing about winter weather, it keeps the miscreants indoors; nobody sits on the porch shouting a conversation to their neighbor in the winter and few people congregate for long periods on the corner.</p>
<p>I would be surprised if Buffalo had an all out riot. There just isn&rsquo;t a place in the city to destroy. Main street has few stores and mainly office and government buildings. They could swarm the Elmwood Strip which is an area where largely white yuppies pretend to live in a multicultural paradise with their few &#8216;colorful&rsquo; local characters.</p>
<p>Blacks are largely concentrated on the &#8216;east side&rsquo; which is the ghetto they have created for themselves. There also isn&rsquo;t a well-formed black consciousness movement here. There&rsquo;s the occasional grumbling but nothing ever has traction.</p>
<p>Of course, social media could change all that in a heartbeat as could an alleged &#8216;racist&rsquo; incident. There have been a couple incidents that Buffalo blacks have tried to inflame but the protesters number about 30 at best.<br>
 <br>
Buffalo blacks haven&rsquo;t been able to organize around any issue so I don&rsquo;t see a riot happening here unless a racial incident occurs which could unite them in rage.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible but I would say unlikely.</p>

		<p>How many of us had parents/grandparents who grew up (on average) a lot poorer than the youffs in these cities? Think of the Joad family or the Trümmerfrauen (rubble women) in post WWII Germany, that&rsquo;s poverty for you. Unlike the Haitians, White women did yeoman work in rebuilding Germany. Or for an even better picture, go to Google and look up &#8220;Hiroshima vs Detroit - 64 years later&#8221;. </p>
<p>Sooner or later, the money tap is going to run out, welfare will be cut, eliminated or turned over to private agencies. At some point, Whites near these areas will be forced to deal with 50 - 75 years of welfare and the misguided attempt to square the circle. Segregation served a purpose, Were there talented blacks who chafed at being stuck with deadbeats, certainly. But in its own way, the talented tenth was a barrier between productive whites and feral blacks. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sound like Bull Connor to my kids, but I am making every attempt that I can to get them to realize what they are dealing with when it comes to most blacks. Fortunately, most of the minorities in my kids school are the adopted Chinese girls, not section 8 blacks (and this is in a school that is 95% White). However, they are starting to notice differences, even among blacks and mulattoes. My daughter has one mulatto in her class. His dad, who is black, owns his own business and seems to be reasonably bright and productive. Mom is white and has the demeanor of a white person (at least in public). I personally don&rsquo;t agree with this pairing and have told my kids that such a marriage was illegal in some states until the 1960&rsquo;s. However this kid outperforms the few blacks running around.   </p>
<p>Imagine a situation where a Chinese run company is managing the affairs of one of these cities or even (lets just say) the state of Ohio. Do you think it will be business as usual? China has a demographic problem we do not understand. What do you do with 50 million (or more) men who have no hope for a wife, a family, etc? They will probably put them into the Army and use them as &#8220;Shock troops&#8221; against anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want Chinese involvement. Africa will probably be the testing ground for this type of unit. <br>

		<p>What truly escapes the author are the many mid-sized cities that are experiencing black on white hate crimes at a rate that approaches a smouldering race war.  Many are cities that have equal percentages of black and white population but due to white fantasies about reality, vote as liberal as any city.  Usually these cities have a black mayor with close affiliation to the usual, NAACP, Democrat party, unions, etc.  And racial crimes are swept under the rug, police management either black or sympathetic to socialistic causes.  These will be the battlegrounds that no one expected but are every bit as dangerous as an Atlanta.  I live in one such city in the South.  It bears absolutely no resemblance to the Jim Crow South yet is ready to explode.  It has in the past, large mobs of blacks attacking whites.  I expect this time they will over reach, thinking their black mayor will take care of the homies.  In the end it will be bad very bad.</p>

<p>Buffalo should not be on that list, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be if the writer of the article actually knew what they were talking about.  Potential for rioting can&rsquo;t simply be broken down into Marxian economic indicators, which is why Buffalo doesn&rsquo;t fit.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you have to look at a city&rsquo;s history of racial violence.  That puts Detroit, Newark, and Filthadelphia at the top of the list.  Also, the city must be top heavy in Black &#8220;leadership&#8221;, i.e. the mayor, city councils, police, unions, etc.  Their  police forces must be handicapped by affirmative action hiring, and therefore have a lack of effective coordination and desire to respond.  That&rsquo;s the perfect storm.</p>
<p>Buffalo, thankfully, is cut right down the middle by an expressway that splits the city into East (Black) and West (White)  &mdash;  and Blacks are cut off from the south by another major highway.  The police force, at least traditionally, has been under the control of Whites of Irish, Polish, and Italian descent.  Same with the Unions.  Unlike Detroit, the White population in Buffalo is large, stable, and relatively safe for a city its size.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine where Blacks would congregate in Buffalo to riot.  Maybe down by the baseball stadium, but there isn&rsquo;t much to destroy around there.    Anywhere on the West Side, such as Elmwood, would be dangerous for them because it would be hard for them to get back to the East Side without getting trapped by the police.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear from other Whites who live in the other cities on the list and get their take on rioting potentials&hellip;.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with the criteria used to determine ranking. There&rsquo;s a few other things needed. First, you need someone else to riot against, which means accessible white neighborhoods. Then you need stores and other places to loot as rioters need financial incentives. That&rsquo;s why burnt up places like Detroit shouldn&rsquo;t be ranked so high. They just indulge in crime rather than riot.<br>
I see Milwaukee is #6 on the list. Most of them are probably first, second and third generation migrants from Chicago who arrived during the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s. They were all welfare careerists who migrated there because the benefits and housing were much more generous. The good hearted people of Wisconsin ended up attracting some of our worst cases. They may be learning that no good deed goes unpunished.</p>

		<p>I humbly suggest that gun ownership per capita, as an inverse relationship, is a reliable predictor of race riots.  It indirectly measures a far more important stat&hellip;..percentage of crimes that end with the black criminal dead on the pavement.  Although stats like that are not kept in any ready form to be of use to people who would use them to identify neighborhoods filled with strong whites, willing to use violence to kill black criminals, every criminal knows where these places are and avoids them like the plague.</p>
<p>Perhaps a survey among criminals might be an effective tool for this.  Hey, homeboy&hellip;.which neighborhoods would you never ever step foot in, and why.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s a reason Dallas isn&rsquo;t on the list. Interstate 30 bisects the city into northern (white) and southern (black) sections. And like Buffalo, the city government has never fallen into black hands. Unlike Buffalo, Dallas residents (like the rest of Texas) take the 2nd Amendment seriously and won&rsquo;t hesitate to shoot any black rioters. Good thing, too, given that around 2/3 of Dallas&rsquo; policemen live in the suburbs and might well ignore emergency recall orders if they believe their own neighborhoods are in danger.</p>
<p>Anonymous (#16) said: <i># 2 Miami : In 1960 all White and perfectly safe. Today, over 80% Hispanic and drug culture galore. I believe at last count it was all of 7% White only 40 years later.</i></p>
<p>True, but the vast majority of those Hispanics are politically conservative Cubans who have no more use for blacks than anyone else. Also, Miami&rsquo;s blacks are clustered in a few small areas that could easily be isolated if necessary. Add in Florida&rsquo;s excellent &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; self-defense law, and I wouldn&rsquo;t give a wooden nickel for the life of any black rioter.</p>

First, the memory of racial discrimination and the violent response by segregationists to non violent civil rights demonstrations made many whites sympathetic to the rioters.

		<p>I lived in Buffalo in the late-60s, early-70s, and was struck even then of the integrity of the white ethnic neighborhoods of that city.  I went back around 2005, driving around the city for a few days with an out-of-state relative looking to purchase rental properties, and I found much the same thing, although the black population had spread.  But there were still some intact white working-class neighborhoods, a rarity anywhere in the northeast.  The City of Tonawanda, north of Buffalo in Erie County is similar.  Reminded me much of the neighborhoods I grew up in as a kid: safe, clean, orderly.  Could walk around at night without fear of molestation.</p>

<p>Just to remind you and other readers that those so-called peaceful demonstrations weren&rsquo;t exactly that.  Someone just posted the fact that the marchers to Selma sacked the numerous mom and pop stores along the route.  Also, search the Amren document, &#8220;Selma 40 Years Later.&#8221;  These marches were planned outrages, calculated to evoke a violent reaction.</p>

		<p>Whoever complied this report, they had to have used some quantitative statistic or a some combination of quantitative statistics.  What or how, they don&rsquo;t tell us.  The reason this can&rsquo;t be a qualitative measure is that New Orleans and Buffalo are tied at 5, (in which case they should have made the next one on the list, Milwaukee at 7, and then 8, 9, 10&hellip;14.)  However, whatever measure, they don&rsquo;t tell us if this quantitative ranking is in ascending order or descending order, most to least likely to have riots or least to most likely.</p>
<p>I looked around on that website, and from the political slant of the other material, this study seems to be a product of dweeb liberals who think that blacks riot because of income inequality stats or home value differentials.  Because that&rsquo;s the way black riots always start   &mdash;   Jerome and Shaniqua in Cleveland are sitting at their breakfast nook reading the Wall Street Journal, and Shaniqua shows Jerome a piece about how the standard deviation for Cleveland&rsquo;s standard distribution curve of income distribution has increased, and another piece about Cleveland&rsquo;s median home values as a percentage of the national average declining by another 2% last quarter, and Jerome figures, &#8220;hey, lemme call Tyrell, Rufus, Rastus and N&rsquo;Deshawntavious and go out and break things!&#8221;  Shaniqua calls her best friends who always wanted to go on a shopping spree at Needless Markup.</p>

		<p><i> cities with especially high rates of reported police misconduct, high disparity between rich and poor, city budget deficits threatening social services, high incidence of hate crime, and large differences in home values between neighborhoods.</i></p>
<p>50 years ago these things might have been plausible excuses for rioting. But America has  had half a century of every liberal social engineering plan imaginable, and things are worse than ever.  How many of the cited conditions are the direct result of liberal policies? We might look at how affirmative action pushed incompetents into government and law enforcement and civil service. And the sexual revolution and welfare creating an exploding population of single parent families and rootless youth.  And crime and anti-white policies driving the middle class out of the cities and into the suburbs.  And the big government approach creating an expectation that the state would provide social services instead of local communities  &mdash;  with obvious consequences when the taxpayer support ran out. </p>
<p>And how much of the &#8220;hate&#8221; crime is committed by minorities? Some jurisdictions count black versus hispanic gang violence as &#8220;hate&#8221; crime, indicating that all the &#8220;oppressed&#8221; minorities just seem to want to kill each other. Which brings in the issue of illegal aliens being played off against the older American underclass, and the general decline in working class wages as a result. Toss in globalism, promoted by liberal internationalism.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, there is no credible mainstream conservative alternative. Well, perhaps once the system starts disintegrating things will break loose and a new wave of realism will be the result.</p>

		<p>The black race race riots of the 1960s happened almost exclusively outside of the deep South. Keep in mind, blacks were (and are) a much larger proportion of the population down south and whites there were (and still are) much less inclined to  coddle and make excuses for them. This reality proves that once you give them an inch, they&rsquo;ll usually take a mile. Whites wouldn&rsquo;t be worrying about riots/flash mobs if blacks knew that  there&rsquo;d be zero tollerance for any kind of coordinated mischeif from their population. The country never had to fear black riots before the cultural revoultion which started circa 1965. </p>

The statistics give an unmindful idea of a handful of cities with the potential to riot.</p>
<p>However, in order to steer out of harm&rsquo;s way, American&rsquo;s must evaluate the gross influence of intellectuals from whome the potential of non-whites to riot will likely emerge through those in power.</p>
<p>Black ghetto culture is a copy of a dysfunctional white subculture brought by New Britons and Scotts-Irish to the South dating back to the antibellum period.</p>
<p>In order for intellectuals to seize in lionizing black ghetto culture as authentic black identity, blue collar American&rsquo;s must emphasize that a culture of industriousness, thrift, family solidarity, and reverence for education play a greater role in the success of non-whites than civil rights laws or majority prejudice.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am surprised to see Atlanta on the list because Atlanta has been the hub of the new remigration of blacks returning south from the north. Just outside Atlanta, Dekalb county has the wealthiest black population in the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>The notable issue with the Atlanta Metropolitan Area is that it is actually a fairly &#8220;diverse&#8221; area. Blacks do not make up a huge majority the way they do in other cities. The large presence of &#8220;easy targets&#8221; (professional urban whites) makes it an area which could possibly see the most bloody rioting. </p>
<p>Race isn&rsquo;t the only factor which can trigger a riot, however. A WTO conference, as shown with Seattle in 1999, easily throws many types of white people into a stone-trowing frenzy (indeed, it is an organization that should throw all whites into rage). </p>
<p>I think Miami is perhaps too high on this list. Milwaukee is a much more likely number two, or even number one. </p>
<p>Many &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; are likely in Newark, but I predict that a sustained riot would be swiftly put down by Governor Christie (unless he happens to be on vacation). </p>

		<p> I was involved in one of the few &#8220;white&#8221; riots that occurred in Boston in 1975. Forced desegregation meant that I had to get on a bus in my irish neighborhood of Charlestown and ride to a dangerous black neighborhood of Roxbury  to satisfy some liberal politician&rsquo;s idea of diversity. We fought back, mainly against the police, but the Boston police in 1975 were working class Irish from neighborhoods as Charlestown and Southie. The liberal elites in their lilly white suburban communities pitted us against each other. The Boston public school system was 70% white in the 1970&#8221;s. It is now 8% white, yet they still spend millions a year to bus brown and black kids to brown and black schools.  Dumb violent schools.     </p>

Everywhere blacks go they carry with them the prehistoric savagery of the African jungle. They bring nothing of value to an area. Liberals can blare all they want about the value of diversity. Most people realize that the societies that behave and perform the best are homogeneous white or East Asian societies. The longer a race has practiced civilization, the more civilized it is. <br>
 <br>
Large numbers of blacks only began living in cities during the twentieth century. Urban areas inhabited by blacks are not centers of civilization. They are asphalt jungles. Culture can change in a generation. Human nature requires many hundreds, and often thousands of years to change. <br>
 <br>
Most blacks cannot be civilized, but they can be subdued by the fear of punishment. The more severe the punishment is, the better the effect. </p>

Don&rsquo;t know if this has been mentioned already, but I would add Kansas City, Missouri, to the list. It&rsquo;s not as toxic as some of these other cities, but the blacks in KC have turned the downtown area into a ghost town and lately they&rsquo;ve been invading the Country Club Plaza, the premiere upscale shopping district and tourist attraction in the city. It&rsquo;s the familiar pattern: hundreds of &#8220;youths&#8221; descending on the area, shops closing down early, random attacks on whites. The other day, Kansas City&rsquo;s black mayor, Sly James, was almost caught in the crossfire when shots were fired in a mob of &#8220;teenagers&#8221; on the Plaza and the cops are patrolling the area on horseback, always a bad sign.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;m neither Irish nor from Boston, but the destruction of both that city&rsquo;s school system and Southie was due in large part to the unbending and unapologetic arrogance of Wendell Arthur Garrity, Jr., who knew better than the people who lived in the city.  If any one person had single-handed  responsibility for that debacle it was him.  But even more than him, was the constitutionally unsupportable decision (and the legal progeny) of Brown v. Board of Education.  I am very familiar with many members of the federal judiciary: these people have been given enormous power, and virtually none of them are able to resist its temptation. </p>
