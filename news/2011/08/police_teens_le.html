<h1>Police: Teens Leave Church Picnic to Riot in East Liberty</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WPXI (Pittsburgh), August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 100 teenagers swarmed from a McDonald&rsquo;s to Trader Joe&rsquo;s to a new Target store during a riot in East Liberty on Sunday, police said.</p>
<p>Police said the trouble started at Mellon Park, where Mount Ararat Baptist Church had just wrapped up its community picnic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When reporter Dave Bondy arrived at the scene, police were everywhere. At least a dozen officers were ordering hundreds of teenagers to leave Penn Avenue.</p>
<p>A group of juveniles ran into Target and, according to an employee, they caused a mess in the toy aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;They came in Target, they were throwing chairs, everybody went running,&#8221; said witness Shauny Bowe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody was just running everywhere,&#8221; said Bowe. &#8220;They went to McDonald&rsquo;s, and they told people to get out, cussing and swearing. They were about to taze people. I was scared for my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>As members of the church cleaned up the park, they said they are saddened that a day of fun and worship is now associated with disruption and vandalism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said they made only a few arrests and no one needed to be seen by medics.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>If only once the national news would cover a story like this, it might be enough to shock the nation.  Alas, they just refuse to do it.  I guess it&rsquo;s not &#8220;newsworthy&#8221; - or, rather, it&rsquo;s TOO newsworthy.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t it racist that these big companies refuse to locate in black neighorhoods?  Don&rsquo;t these white racists know that the only color that matters is green?</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t even have to watch the video. We all know who these &#8220;teens&#8221; are. Black baptists sure know how to &#8220;worship&#8221; don&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>This is more proof about what the occasional AR regular who was once also a juvenile probation officer has been trying to tell us   &mdash;   Anything which gathers juvenile blacks together only serves to fete and beg for violent crime.  Even if it is under direct supervision of law enforcement (Police Athletic League).  </p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of his words when I read this on V-Dare a few days ago:</p>

		<p>In Pittsburgh,businesses have been failing for generations because of black crime,Target,Home Depot will be the latest,and are located in East Liberty,they did not want to open there,but were pressured by city officials in an effort to prove &#8220;that we all be the same&#8221;!The city is surronded by black areas,and now suburbs are being blessed with section 8 housing,if the presidential election goes the wrong way,Pittsburgh will be one of the first to burn,it may be hard to recognize,as it is burning already!</p>

		<p>One more example that the evangelicals are an even bigger enemy than these criminals.</p>
<p>The Gospel was not meant for blacks. They do not have the capacity to understand it, let alone the ability to live like the elect.</p>

		<p>This is yet more proof that religion   &mdash;   Christianity included   &mdash;   is not some sort of vaccine against black predatory behavior.  A black coming home from church is still black.  Our Religious Right is simply blind or stupid for not recognizing as much.  </p>

		<p>Aside from the mosques where Imams stand up and approved the rape of the indigenous women of their host country,  some Black churches are the only other places that breed hatred for others. I don&rsquo;t think that Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church is the only one. I never read about Jesus preaching hatred for others.</p>

		<p>having lived in a black ghetto i get frustrated at comments frome white people such as lock them up or where are the parents. young blacks take pride in getting locked up ie they earn stripes and jail is nothing more than hundreds of their friends even the guards are from their hood. their dad is usually absent ie prison and their mom is either on heroin or crack i think this type of naiveté is why we have a marxist militant black muslim racist for president</p>

		<p>Some time ago a Catholic street fair in the North Hills of Pittsburgh was hit by a flash mob, patrons were punched, and all money stolen.  Speaking of Flash Mobs,there is a t.v. commercial running now where a White man goes into a dance,I believe in the middle of a train station, he then gets a text that the &#8220;Flash Mob&#8221; dance troupe has been moved to another time, a look of embarrassment floods over him, and a nearby black male stairs at him with disdain!  The message, link Whites to Flash Mobs!</p>

		<p>Every time they hold a &#8216;Stop the Violence&rsquo; rally around here to convince blacks not to shoot one another, some black ends up shooting one or more fellow blacks. A gathering of more than two almost always ends in violence.</p>
