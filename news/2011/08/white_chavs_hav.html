			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Hastings, Daily Mail (London), August 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Historian David Starkey remained defiant last night after provoking a race storm by claiming the recent riots happened because too many young white people had &#8216;now become black&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The broadcaster was branded a racist yesterday after an appearance on Friday night&rsquo;s Newsnight programme, when he blamed the riots on a &#8216;violent, destructive and nihilistic&rsquo; gang culture, which he said was being embraced by many white and black people.</p>
<p>He stunned his fellow guests on the BBC2 show, writer Owen Jones and black author and broadcaster Dreda Say Mitchell, by placing the blame for the riots squarely with a form of black male culture that he said &#8216;mitigated against education&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;A substantial section of the chavs have become black. The whites have become black. A particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.   </p>
<p>&#8216;Black and white, boy and girl operate in this language together. This language which is wholly false, which is a Jamaican patois, that&rsquo;s been intruded in England and this is why so many of us have this sense of literally a foreign country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fellow broadcasters, politicians and members of the public criticised his remarks on Twitter and other social networking sites yesterday, and some even predicted that his television career was now ruined.</p>
<p>Piers Morgan, the chat-show host and Mail on Sunday columnist, tweeted: &#8216;RIP David Starkey&rsquo;s TV career. And good riddance. Racist idiot.&rsquo; Owen Jones, who challenged Dr Starkey during the Newsnight discussion, said: &#8216;David Starkey has had a career-ending moment, but in the current climate, his comments are very dangerous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a surprise move, the BBC&rsquo;s  business editor, Robert Peston, joined the chorus of disapproval, tweeting: &#8216;David Starkey&rsquo;s nasty ignorance is best ignored not worthy of comment or debate.&rsquo; As a BBC employee, Mr Peston would normally be expected to be impartial about the channel&rsquo;s output.</p>
<p>Dr Starkey last night denied he had said anything racist and said he stood by his comments, reiterating  that in times of economic and political crisis, &#8216;plain speaking&rsquo; was needed.</p>
<p>He told The Mail on Sunday: &#8216;I said until I was blue in the face on the programme that I was not talking about skin colour but gang culture. A large group of whites have started to behave like blacks. I think that is the most unracial remark anyone can make.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr Starkey caused further outrage on Newsnight by claiming that if people listened to David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, on the radio, they would assume he was white.</p>
<p>He added last night: &#8216;David Lammy does sound white, so does [MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington] Diane Abbott, because they&rsquo;ve had a white cultural experience. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons they don&rsquo;t have any street credibility. They have no contact with the young.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In an obvious reference to the phone-hacking scandal, Dr Starkey said that critics like Piers Morgan should concentrate on &#8216;their own legal difficulties&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The historian revealed he had  reread former Minister Enoch Powell&rsquo;s infamous &#8216;Rivers of Blood&rsquo; speech in light of the tensions.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;His prophecy was absolutely right in one sense. The Tiber didn&rsquo;t foam with blood but flames lambent. They wrapped around Tottenham and around Clapham.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yesterday anyone trying to access Newsnight on the BBC&rsquo;s iPlayer service was confronted with a warning stating: &#8216;Guidance: Contains some strong language&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A BBC spokesman said last night: &#8216;Whilst we acknowledge that some people will have found David Starkey&rsquo;s comments offensive, he was robustly challenged by [Newsnight] presenter Emily Maitlis and the other contributors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The BBC declined to comment on Mr Peston&rsquo;s comments and said the warning on iPlayer related to one of the rioter&rsquo;s text messages that Dr Starkey had read out.</p>
<p>David Lammy last night declined to comment.</p>

		<p>Mr. Starkey spoke rather starkly. Of course, he tried too hard to separate culture from what he calls &#8220;skin color&#8221;, but it is true that Marxist/nihilists support the black violence, even if they decided to stay home those evenings.</p>
<p>He said it: Enoch Powell was right!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Career-ending moment&#8221;, according to those who rise in their careers by avoiding the truth and ostracizing those who speak it.  That Piers Morgan is a particular idiot, and I hope he is among the first to be punished if and when the people take back their country.  Everything that Starkey said is right on target.</p>

		<p>Three cheers for David Starkey for speaking the truth.   It is a fact that when young men are drafted into the armed forces, no matter what their education and upbringing, everyone falls down to the level of the lowest common denominator because they think that is the way soldiers, sailors and airmen are supposed to behave.   Same thing with modern day white kids.   They think that blacks dress and act really cool and they want to be just like them.   Thus, they dress like blacks and adopt their street speech.   To compound the problem, our schools which are run by leftists give white children no positive role models to emulate.<br>
Quite the opposite.   They are told that all white men from the past were horrible, evil, sexist, racist, imperialist, homophobes.   When no white men are held up as positive role models, young white kids tend to copy the toughest, meanest and coolest guys on the block&hellip;.the black kids.</p>

		<p>Of course the rioting was mindless thuggery.  Black rioters never think about the consequences of their actions.  And, let&rsquo;s face it, they&rsquo;ve been rioting and destroying for decades with little consequence.  Also, the excuses among the panelists - except Starkey - for black violence is downright nauseating.</p>
<p>If you think these riots were violent, just wait until the financial system collapses.<br>

		<p>Note how eloquently Starkey puts his point across, and sits back and listens when the other guests start spouting off.  Note how they all (including the autocue reader, who should be neutral), interrupt, talk over and talk down to him whenever he talks.  Note that the black &#8220;author&#8221; can barely string a coherent sentence together.  Their argument is so paper thin, they can&rsquo;t let it go unchallenged.  The autocue reader (Maitlis) is terrified of what Starkey has to say.  Note the same reaction from the autocue reader in the video of &#8220;Big Jim&#8221; in Ealing, saying that he saw 100-200 blacks yoofs rampaging.  She&rsquo;s terrified of what he has to say.  I suggest that we all copy videos such as these, and any others on YouTube (apparently videos that show the groups of looters and arsonists as too black are getting deleted) before they disappear down the memory hole.  </p>

		<p>All present please remember the name David Starkey and pass it on to your children and grandchildren. He is to be immune from retribution by the Citizens&rsquo; Councils of the future.</p>
<p>Piers Morgan? Congratulations! You have placed yourself top of the list. Expect a knock on the door in 2040 or whenever Brits finally get their act together and retake their country.</p>
<p>I, for one, will watch your Citizens&rsquo; Council trial with relish when that long off day finally comes to pass.</p>

		<p>Britain continues to die a slow death.  The White British have two options for what Britain will be in the year 2100:  Either an all-White nation made up of the British nationalities, or an all-colored authoritarian nation where the White British have been murdered out of their own country.  For either choice, bloodshed is coming. If they make a conscious decision now to deport all non-Whites, they can save Britain as the historical nation it has been.  Otherwise, the ever increasing non-White population will eventually make the &#8220;necessary&#8221; decision to do away with the remaining White population and form a new nation.  This will come to Europe as well as the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. There is no long-term middle ground of multicultural/multiracial harmony.  It may occur in some areas for some period of time, but it is only temporary.  The end result of multiculturalis is always the same - authoritarianism to the extreme, extermination of one element of society, or a complete societal breakup along ethnocentric lines.</p>

		<p>Another way to put it is that the riots would not have happened except for the high population of blacks and other immigrants in England.</p>
<p>England&rsquo;s earlier history of white gangs go back to post WW2 period, when the so-called &#8220;Teddy Boys&#8221; caused a little trouble. These were white youths who dressed neatly in the Edwardian &#8220;Teddy Boy&#8221; style that was contemporary with how Johnny Cash and even Jerry Lee Lewis dressed in the 1950s.  You can find youtube films about them and the later youth gangs, the Rockers and Mods.  They had clashes too and riots, mostly at the resort town of Brighton on the beach and quay, but it was relatively small.  The Rockers famously got a member who was a Episcopalian Priest who opened a club for them to hang out (59).  He rode with them and never pushed religion at them, just accepted them as people.  They ended up doing lots of club related charity work and continued to love their cafe racers and leather jackets.  That was the start of all the American imitators who ride HDs, but are usually highly Christianized.  Today, you can find a movement still active at The Ace Cafe in London and also The 59 Club, which is opened for membership to enthusiasts worldwide.  Many of us are just old fans of British bikes and rock and roll with no intent to do anything but have a good time with friends and reminisce on old times when we were young and foolish.  This sort of thing has a place in a modern culture like England and is completely different from the terrible situation we have now.</p>
<p>I suggest that Piers Morgan and these other twits who jump at the first chance to call anyone, even a qualified historian a &#8220;racist&#8221; go rent the film, &#8220;The Harder They Come,&#8221; so they can better connect the Jamaican gang culture to what they see in England now.  Most of the music isn&rsquo;t too bad.  (And that&rsquo;s the hook for youth).</p>

<p>Um, what?  That&rsquo;s a pretty explicitly racial remark.  Completely true mind you, but definitely racial.</p>

<p>Gang culture? WHO is it that has a gang culture? Yeah, I see Whites all over the place that are in &#8220;gangs&#8221;&hellip;Don&rsquo;t you? Those are the wiggers.</p>
<p>Not &#8220;skin&#8221; color&#8221;, he says? Let&rsquo;s stop with this skin color nonsense as opposed to one&rsquo;s RACE! Their DNA.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t their &#8220;skin color&#8221; that makes a RACE of people. Japanese are even whiter than Caucasians. So are they of the White race? NO! Whites have varying degrees of color also, so are they of a different RACE?  NO! </p>
<p>As for the word Chav as these &#8220;whites&#8221; are called here is a definition. Sounds like they want to label all of WN&rsquo;s does it not? &#8220;Racist, narrow minded, xenophobic, uses slang language, not too clever&#8221;. Guess we are just all chavs and not too bright, and use slang language, right?</p>
<p>The stereotype of &#8220;chav&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chav&#8221; has started to mean a variety of things. Chavs DO NOT wear Burberry – this happened only in the &rsquo;90s and early &rsquo;00s. Chavs are narrow-minded and xenophobic, sometimes racist and, more often than not, not very clever. Chavs also tend to use slang language to appear &#8220;cooler&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chavs are usually associated with petty crime, such as muggings and robbery.</p>

		<p>Of course Mr. Starkey is right. And, trust me, many, many Britons agreed with him. Of course, the news reports concentrated on quoting all the media moguls about how &#8220;racist&#8221; Mr. Starkey&rsquo;s remarks were. That&rsquo;s to be expected; it&rsquo;s like a knee-jerk reaction from them.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that, while four or five people died as a result of the riots, not one of them was a rioter? What&rsquo;s wrong with this picture?</p>

		<p>I watched the program and thought Dr. Starkley did a marvelous job attempting to explain his position even though he was rudely interrupted over and over. He kept his composure in the face of uncivil, poor mannered politically correct operatives. Poor, poor England. I don&rsquo;t think there is much hope. </p>

Oh my, there is that word &#8220;ignorant&#8221; again when speaking the truth. I&rsquo;ve never gotten a satisfactory answer about what exactly we are ignorant about when discussing race. The definition of ignorant is uninformed or unaware, or lacking in knowledge. How can anyone with eyes be unaware, or anyone having spent any amount of time with minorities be lacking in knowledge?</p>

		<p>Starkey tried to appease the liberals by saying Powell was only partly right.  He tried to say it is culture and not race (as though race is not related to culture).  </p>
<p>He tried to make nice,<br>
and where did it get him?</p>
<p>Powell&rsquo;s central thesis was correct: Due to immigration policies, London now has a large dependent population that is hostile to the white population.</p>

<p>Sorry, but they don&rsquo;t want a &#8220;punk @#! job&#8221; to use their language.  They were dressed in fashionable athletic shoes, they got twitter accounts and smart phones, and they don&rsquo;t walk around in despair.  They have swaggar and seem to be having a fun time.  They are unburdened by jobs and tight schedules.  They don&rsquo;t need to set the alarm clock because they will sleep in the next day after a long night of looting.</p>

<p>The black woman wants to use the term &#8220;We&#8221; and &#8220;our childen&#8221; when talking about the rioters.  Sorry but it was not &#8220;we&#8221; who rioted it was &#8220;them&#8221;  and many of &#8220;them&#8221; were not &#8220;children.&#8221;  Many where in their late teems, early twenties.  Many were legal adults.  </p>

		<p>Of course Mr. Starkey is wrong. Ultimately the riots happened because blacks are biologically different from whites and won&rsquo;t be able to accomplish things on the same level, on average, as whites and culture has almost nothing to do with it. Except in the sense that the government and the MSM (which is part of culture) is trying to forcing the races together.<br>
All the people on this show and even Nick Griffin&rsquo;s speech are trying to dance around the central issue of the different races&rsquo; average biological inequality.     </p>

In the past, I&rsquo;ve tried to see the world from their point of view, but it&rsquo;s impossible to keep up the pretence. It&rsquo;s all about how things &#8220;should be&#8221; in an ideal world, if only people would do this, or do that. Not about how things are, right now, in the real world.

		<p>Well, I watched the video, and there are no heroes here.  Starkey says some correct things, but comes off as too much of a vacillating wuss, failing to bluntly summarize his thoughts.</p>
<p>The young white apologist is a cliche, and one can only hope that the years will season him, so that he is one day embarrassed by his own comments.</p>
<p>The black lady wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I feared, but is hopelessly wrong in her hope for &#8220;one community&#8221; with &#8220;our children&#8221;.  You can&rsquo;t have that as long as you have multiculturalism and racial diversity.  She should favor dissolving &#8220;black culture&#8221;, to make her dream come true - but she doesn&rsquo;t.  She can never win.  It will always be &#8220;them&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221;.</p>
<p>The moderator lady is the worst.  She looks viscerally worked up by the suggestion that &#8220;black culture = bad&#8221;, and never really gets over the shock.  In reality, of course, the point was that a black SUBCULTURE is bad, not everything about black culture (though, I must admit, I can&rsquo;t think of anything good about it).</p>

<p>&#8220;Not &ldquo;skin&rdquo; color&rdquo;, he says? Let&rsquo;s stop with this skin color nonsense as opposed to one&rsquo;s RACE! Their DNA.&#8221;</p>
<p> __ Right, DNA.  That means that darker &#8220;whites&#8221; that you claim to be white with such a variation of skin color would show non-Caucasian genetics.  Many of accepted whites are from a too wide - or dark a spectrum to be considered &#8220;white.&#8221;  And yet they are because they claim it.  The genetic drift is being missed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&rsquo;t their &ldquo;skin color&rdquo; that makes a RACE of people. Japanese are even whiter than Caucasians. So are they of the White race? NO! Whites have varying degrees of color also, so are they of a different RACE? NO!&#8221;</p>
<p>__ This illustrates my above comment.  Not true.  Japanese are often more brown than whiter looking and their eyes are always dark brown and hair black.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the word Chav as these &ldquo;whites&rdquo; are called here is a definition. Sounds like they want to label all of WN&rsquo;s does it not? &ldquo;Racist, narrow minded, xenophobic, uses slang language, not too clever&rdquo;. Guess we are just all chavs and not too bright, and use slang language, right?</p>
<p>The stereotype of &ldquo;chav&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chav&rdquo; has started to mean a variety of things. Chavs DO NOT wear Burberry – this happened only in the &rsquo;90s and early &rsquo;00s. Chavs are narrow-minded and xenophobic, sometimes racist and, more often than not, not very clever. Chavs also tend to use slang language to appear &ldquo;cooler&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Chavs are usually associated with petty crime, such as muggings and robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>___ Chavs are the remnant of the earlier British &#8220;skinhead&#8221; movement, which grew out of the New Wave Punk style of the late &rsquo;70s and 80s.  Many of them were put out of work or denied work as the impact of growing immigration (usually from Pakistan, but Africa and Jamaica too) displaced them.  They felt abused by their government and society.  So they turned to those most sympathetic to them, Nazi inspired skinheads.  They never were from the best class, but they were British.  They should have been worked with and culturally stabilized. That could have been done if not for Labour&rsquo;s drive for more and more immigration.  I recall Gordon Brown&rsquo;s comment a few years ago concerning them.  He regarded them as an undesirable class of Brits who had always historically been a problem. (Regardless of their endless use by the military for centuries and usually through abduction). He spoke as if their elimination through absorption into the non-white immigrants would be the solution.  All that has happened is that the base of &#8220;Chavs&#8221; has been expanded and allied with non-white gangs.  I am betting that those Brits stripped by blacks were actually Chavs whose supposed allies turned on them.  The later Skinheads actually liked and identified with Jamaican &#8220;Reggae&#8221; music.  This led to a sort of truce and eventual alliance.  The current nationalists are far more intellectual and non-violent, still believing in law and order.  It would help if our leaders would attempt to grasp cultural dynamics better. </p>

		<p>Perhaps poverty causes people, irregardless of skin color, to commit desperate and violent acts.  Whites can be poor, and as we have seen, can take their frustrations to the street - just as well as blacks.</p>
<p>I think it is interesting how Mr. Starkey is attempting to blame black culture for a breakdown in white society, as if whites are morally weak and easily corrupted. A more reasonable explanation of why whites were rioting alongside blacks could be that whites are beginning to realize they too are becoming displaced and dispossessed. </p>
<p>As whites feel increasingly swindled, deceived, and abused by their corrupt leaders and institutions, they are just as likely to demand redress. Anyone who thinks whites are not capable of such street justice might want to revisit the French revolution to remind themselves of just how violent whites can be.</p>
<p>It might be time to recognize that when an individual feels dispossessed from society, they become frustrated and enraged - regardless of color.  But then again, if the majority of a community feel they are incapable of such activities, and that only the inferior possess a predilection to such behavior, then maybe the ruling elite have nothing to worry about?</p>

		<p>This historian is most likely a classical liberal and has the ability to simply cut to the chase.  Historians should be able, like Starkey, to speak clearly&hellip;which he absolutely did!  I happen to know through personal career choices made, that he is in fact speaking what is true.  Naturally there are white gangs, certainly gangs made up of *white* people long before blacks were able to *gang-up* in the US&hellip;there are always gangs of some form or another.  But, when white people (beginning as teens and earlier) do not have a strong caucausian family and historical connection to look up to they will usually take on that which is most fashionable in current pop culture&hellip;it is true that the black sub- and counter-cultures have been pushed upon the American (as well as the Brits) psyche by way of television (the best mind contro contraption known to man)&hellip;it is cool to be black&hellip;that is what young America (and Brits and other once proud to be caucasion countries) is *shown*&hellip;black music, dress, conduct, speech and so on&hellip;it&rsquo;s just *cool*&hellip;but with it comes the counter-cultural elements which are used for anarchy&hellip;is it deliberate?&hellip;yes, but only realized by a small group of elite propagandists&hellip;most everything else is knee jerk liberal reactionarism (this was a trick too)&hellip;This historian has insight into what is happening and yet he cannot reveal this effectively because he is going to fall on his sword&hellip;this man is simply telling people what is true and yet he has no idea his remarks are going to destroy him because he is truely innocent&hellip;he is no racist, and yet he will be anathematized because of his *knowledge*&hellip;that he dared speak it!  There are anti-social criminal components to the black counter culture (just as there are to any white *counter-culture*&hellip;only now the white culture is viewed as the evil counter-culture by certain powers in power)which is why it IS a counter culture! and when whites, asians, or whom ever, take on those elements and act them out&hellip;that is sure to lead to anarchy&hellip; Anarchy is in fact what the radical white haters, American Haters, have been working toward for generations&hellip;They are so thrilled modern anarchy days seem to be at hand&hellip;they don&rsquo;t realize it but it&rsquo;s going to *get* them as well&hellip;what clowns they have been to think they could toy with an entire race of people who have roots in ancient Rome, Viking genes&hellip;can trace their personal roots back to Charlemagne&hellip;and beyond!</p>

<p>There were very FEW Whites rioting in England and most people KNOW it. We know how the media works against Whites at every opportunity. </p>
<p>Sorry, Whites NEVER have acted out like blacks do. Maybe the French did, so what?  Even in the great depression you did not see Whites behave as blacks do, blacks do the same  even in a good economy where they get everything free. </p>
<p> You want to talk about poor, most Whites were POOR 60 years ago and beyond!  WE are talking about the last 50 years or so since there was AA and DEsegregation and more and more African/blacks flooding White lands. We see nothing but violence from the black population all over the world. So for you, to say, that Whites are just as bad, is nothing more than wishful thinking on YOUR part.</p>

<p>  You can hardly compare the present situation of whites on the dole in contemporary Great Britain to the plight of starving French peasants and urban slum dwellers under France&rsquo;s ancient regime. I can think of few 18th century peasants eating at fast food restaurants, and owning flat screen televisions or air conditioners. No, the London riots were not political in nature. As Dr. Starkey has said, no government buildings or offices were attacked by the rioters</p>
<p>The white &ldquo;yobs&rsquo; were opportunistic criminals taking advantage of social anarchy. It was no protest against unemployment and social injustice.  Justice was far more severe in 18th century Great Britain, where &ldquo;transportation&rdquo; was common and petty thieves could face hanging. Poverty and unemployment were more endemic and brutal in the 19th century, where debtors were sent to workhouses. And finally, social conditions were more chaotic during the London Blitz, where German bombers were illuminated by search lights and artillery explosions in the evening sky. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that blacks initiated the London riots and were the majority of the rioters. The culture of entitlement and grievance was promoted by Leftish politicians and the privileged media elites. The underclass problem in Great Britain, perhaps goes beyond race, but race and immigration have made the problem more endemic and intractable. <br>

<p><i>I have seen groups of whites (usually late teens to early 20s) who try to talk and act Black.</i><br>
You can thank the cultural Marxist&rsquo;s for that, by engineering a world in which White kids have absolutely no positive ethnic /cultural/ historical self identity to connect with in their own world. This void has created a vacuum which has been filled the first &lsquo;cool&rsquo; (do kids still say that?), freeing, empowering, animalistic, social identity that has come along, which in this case also just happens to be in close proximity, although is also broadcast globally in ever increasing emerging media&rsquo;s  for those on the outer cusp.</p>
<p><i>I also see my own dark skinned Indian kids <b>act &ldquo;whiter</b> than conservative whites.&rdquo;</i><br>
Shouldn&rsquo;t that be &ldquo;act more conservative than conservative Whites&rdquo;? <br>
I also, through my teenage step son have witnessed one of his southern Asian friends take on the persona of being a hard hitting, 300 pound, sexual gorilla ghetto thug. I was shocked to find when I came face to face with the Southern Asian &lsquo;smack talking&rsquo; friend that he was a very meek little boy who avoided eye contact, who may I add much to my discontent had narrow dating preference for Australian girls who looked similar to Avril Lavigne, I guess that&rsquo;s what you get when someone from a monochromatic gene pool meets the inclusively indoctrinated.</p>
<p><i>So is white the new Black and South Asian the new white? Who knows?</i><br>
And is black the new southern Asian? Well they&rsquo;re already half way there.<br>
I see the cultural Marxist&rsquo;s are already making inroads in India regarding the way homosexually and woman&rsquo;s rights are viewed in your &lsquo;traditional society&rsquo; via Bollywood. So I wouldn&rsquo;t get too upperity if I was you, as the real value of your people on the global market is that they&rsquo;re just smart enough to get the job done, whilst more importantly being very cheap.<br>
Thus your people are used in a similar way to how scab workers are used to break workers unions by under cutting and devaluing, in this case Western workers and their expensive educations. Once workers entitlements level out globally, your people will find that they are as expendable as the rest of us, when the global elite look for the next cheapest cab off the rank as to take your peoples niche.  <br>
Finally, there&rsquo;s an aspect to my definition of conservatism to which I think fails southern Asian&rsquo;s comprehension, which is to have some class. The ability to emulate an upper class English accent as leftover by product of the Raj or from studying at an English university, or carrying yourself with an aura of arrogant distain does not equate to class, nor does gloating at another&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s downfall as an outsider Sureesh.  <br>
