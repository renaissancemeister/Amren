			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Steenhuysen, Reuters, August 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of Americans newly infected with HIV remained stable between 2006 and 2009, but infections rose nearly 50 percent among young black gay and bisexual men, U.S. experts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>New data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveal progress since the peak of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s. But the sharp increases in infection rates among young black men who have sex with men show there is much more work to do, they said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While blacks represent 14 percent of the U.S. population, they accounted for 44 percent of new HIV infections in 2009. HIV infection rates among blacks were nearly eight times higher than rates in whites, according to the study.</p>
<p>Hispanics, who represent about 16 percent of the population, accounted for 20 percent of new HIV infections in 2009  &mdash;  a rate that was nearly three times as high as that of whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Men who have sex with men  &mdash;  which includes openly gay and bisexual men and those who do not identify themselves as gay or bisexual  &mdash;  remain most heavily affected.</p>
<p>While this group represents 2 percent of the overall U.S. population, they accounted for 61 percent of all new HIV infections in 2009.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s 2009 and they&rsquo;ve yet to release the figures for AIDS deaths. Over 600,000 Americans have died of AIDS. Why do we never, ever, learn the race of those who&rsquo;ve died? 40 years is a long time to wait to learn this important information, and we still don&rsquo;t know. It must be because those darn TV preachers were right, AIDS is different from other medical diseases. </p>

		<p>From the original article, explaining this race disparity:</p>
<p><i>[Gay black men] may encounter more homophobia than other groups, which could keep them from getting tested. </i></p>
<p>Oh, I see how that works.  I hate gays, but I have an extra special cherry-on-top hatred of black gays, and that by itself is keeping gay black men from getting the ELISA test.  I don&rsquo;t need to block the entrance to the public health clinic, all I need to do is have a special hateful place in my special hateful heart for gay black men and gay black men alone, that&rsquo;s all it takes.  I&rsquo;m blocking access to health care and testing &#8220;in spirit.&#8221;  I really should put my evil honky mythical superpowers to better use.</p>

		<p>I wonder how the evil white man used his voo-doo to turn the HIV virus into a RACIST and attack blacks at 8 times the rate of whites? </p>
<p>Google &#8220;48 percent of black women have Herpes&#8221; and tell me what you find. </p>

<p>They may possibly be implying blacks are more &#8216;homophobic&rsquo; than other groups. If that&rsquo;s true, this could be a dangerous opening for hate. Isn&rsquo;t everything blacks do supposed to be the model for everyone else? Perhaps it just makes these victims extra victimized. </p>

		<p>Continuing my sarcasm from above, for a serious public official to say that gay black men aren&rsquo;t getting the HIV/AIDS test because they experience extra homophobia because they&rsquo;re both gay and black is tantamount to saying that if all us homophobes were equal opportunity homophobes, i.e. we hated gay black men no more or less than we hated any other homosexuals, then they wouldn&rsquo;t be scared to get tested.</p>
<p>Official America really ought to think about its bromides and excuses before they release them, rather than just say something that sounds cute and clever but really means nothing or is counterproductive upon logical examination.</p>

<p>We need to conceal the facts and report black have no hiv/aids at all because any negative comment no matter how true concerning blacks is considered racism by these people of genius.</p>

		<p>I agree with anonymous #10.</p>
<p>Aids [i]is[/i] racist.  It&rsquo;s too bad a virus can&rsquo;t be sued, especially one as elusive as AIDS.  Perhaps the gay black men can recover from a special victims fund supported by taxpayers to compensate them for the racism AIDS has inflicted upon them.  It&rsquo;s only fair that they should be compensated.</p>

		<p>Since testing for HIV means testing for antibodies to the proteins in the test kit, it may be that people of African ancestry are more likely to develop a reaction to the proteins in the test. My understanding is that caribbean hispanics are more apt to be HIV positive whereas mestizos (indian mixed with european) are not.  </p>
