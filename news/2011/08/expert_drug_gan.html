<h1>Expert: Drug Gangs Control Half of Mexico</h1>
 

<p>Fox News Latino, August 26, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Violent crime has become a problem of national security in Mexico, where half of the territory is outside of state control and &#8220;we&rsquo;re in the hands of the narcos,&#8221; an intelligence expert and author of a new book on Mexico&rsquo;s public safety woes, said.</p>
<p>Jorge Carrillo Olea, founder of Mexico&rsquo;s leading intelligence center, said the &#8220;state has lost territorial control, and therefore governability,&#8221; over roughly 50 percent of the country.</p>
<p>The government has been incapable of fully enforcing the law and ensuring justice is upheld, said Carrillo, who spoke to Efe while in Mexico City to promote his new book, &#8220;Mexico en riesgo; una vision personal sobre un Estado a la defensive&#8221; (Mexico at Risk: A Personal Vision of a State on the Defensive), published this year by Grijalbo.</p>
<p>Carrillo, who in 1989 founded the Center for Research and National Security, or Cisen, a civil entity overseen by the interior ministry, said Mexico&rsquo;s crime and public safety problems will last for decades because the society has &#8220;reached a point of no return.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Governments also have undermined the nation&rsquo;s sovereignty with their policies, ceding authority to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI-&#8220;who act like lords and owners in our country&#8221;-and even openly requesting assistance from the United States, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If policies are measured by their results, there haven&rsquo;t been any positive results so far. Even though the authorities say they&rsquo;ve decapitated the (criminal) organizations, these have multiplied and extended (their reach),&#8221; Carrillo, who also once served as governor of the central state of Morelos, said.</p>
<p>Only the formal structures have changed and President Felipe Calderon&rsquo;s 2006-2012 administration will conclude with some 50,000 drug-related deaths, according to the expert, who worked closely with the previous administrations of Luis Echeverria, 1970-1976; Jose Lopez Portillo, 1976-1982; Miguel de la Madrid, 1982-1988; and Carlos Salinas, 1988-1994.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve passed the point of no return and no president,&#8221; regardless of party affiliation, can do much to solve the security woes, Carrillo said, adding that Calderon&rsquo;s successor will have to have a &#8220;very serious, large team in place to analyze and tackle the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8220;that won&rsquo;t satisfy people,&#8221; the expert predicted. He therefore called for a grand national alliance that promotes long-term solutions, which he said must be in the hands of institutions, not individuals.</p>
