			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBC News, August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toronto police officers &#8220;interacted&#8221; with three men ahead of a fatal shooting and wounding of two others after this weekend&rsquo;s Caribbean Carnival parade in Toronto, the province&rsquo;s Special Investigations Unit says.</p>
<p>A 30-year-old Toronto man died and two other people were hospitalized after the incident.</p>
<p>The deceased has been identified, but his name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin, according to police. A post-mortem in Toronto is scheduled for Monday morning.</p>
<p>The SIU, a civilian agency that investigates situations involving police and civilians that lead to a serious injury or death, said police were called to an area near the parade after receiving a report of a disturbance involving three men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Officers interacted with the men and shots were fired,&#8221; the SIU said in a news release early Sunday.</p>
<p>No more details about the shooting were released. It is unclear whether the officers involved fired the bullets that killed the man or wounded the others.</p>
<p>Emergency services officials said two people  &mdash;  the 30-year-old male and a 21-year-old Pickering woman  &mdash;  suffered multiple gunshot wounds, while the third male victim, an 18-year-old from Toronto, was injured in the eye.</p>
<p>The SIU said one man and the woman were taken to St. Mike&rsquo;s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The woman underwent surgery on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The man with the eye injury was admitted to Toronto General Hospital.</p>
<p>The SIU said it had assigned six investigators and three forensics investigators to the incident. Interviews with 16 civilian witnesses were progressing, the SIU said.</p>
<p>Festival CEO Denise Herrera Jackson said in a statement on the carnival&rsquo;s website that organizers are deeply saddened by the loss of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our festival is about love and community, and to have this happen so close to our event is devastating,&#8221; Jackson said in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We work so hard to make our event safe and family friendly, it is unthinkable that such a thing could happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: The happenings at the Canadian Caribbean Festival are strangely similar to the chaos that broke out at the <a href="/news/2011/06/video_fatal_sho.html">Washington, DC, Caribbean Festival</a>.</em>]</p>

		<p>Nobody from the founding British stock or continental Germanic immigrants puts 2 + 2 together here publicly and the most race-conscious people are the East &amp; South Europeans and Brown &amp; Yellow Asians. Too bad Canada is such a young country born in the 20th century, its founding British stock easily self-manipulated in search of a new non-European identity.</p>

		<p>That reminds me, there&rsquo;s the Notting Hill Carnival at the end of the month in London.  Goody, can&rsquo;t wait. </p>

		<p>The very title of this article is laced with anti-police attitude, making it sound as though officers take liberties to shoot people for no reason at such events. Perhaps CBS News should gather facts and details before reporting. </p>

		<p>Same problem here in London every year with the Notting Hill Carnival. Blacks running riot, stabbing and shooting people. It&rsquo;s all done in the name of &#8220;Diversity&#8221;. Last year there were over 400 arrests.Our Left-Wing liberal press and TV tries to hush up the violence by showing only blacks dancing to bongo drums and having a jolly good time at the taxpayer&rsquo;s expence.<br>
Time the West wised up to the contribution being made by blacks to our culture - violence,disease and disorder!</p>

		<p>&#8220;<i>I used to enjoy visiting Toronto. I(t) was so clean and safe compared to American cities.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>I used to enjoy living in Toronto until the notion of white flight overcame my resistance to leave.</p>
<p>American visitors to Toronto once marvelled at the clean streets, helpful residents, and most of all, a 95% homogeneous white population that allowed for safe walking at anytime. But that was 35-40 years ago.</p>
<p>Irresponsible immigration from non-white countries has essentially changed that once-great city to one now resembling any U.S. city where the white population barely hovers over 54%. </p>
<p>Black crime did not come into existence until low-skilled Caribbean immigrants began arriving in significant numbers during the &rsquo;70s.  </p>
<p>Today, blacks represent just over 8% of Toronto&rsquo;s population, but they&rsquo;re responsible for about 80% of the violent crime. Newspapers won&rsquo;t reveal these stats, but talking to any cop on the street will tell you the facts.</p>

		<p>The Toronto Caribbean Festival was run by CEO Denise Herrera Jackson. The provided link to the Washington, D.C. Caribbean Festival story chronicled an event with similar chaotic behavior. </p>
<p>Question: is &#8220;Ms.&#8221; Jackson the CEO of both events? Is her company in charge of the upcoming Notting Hill event mentioned by other posters? </p>
<p>For awhile, we had a fellow out here who would rent halls under false pretences. He would claim to represent this or that &#8220;civic group,&#8221; then use the hall for rap parties that usually ended in fights and shootings. Somebody needs to see if that is &#8220;Ms.&#8221; Jackson&rsquo;s <i>modus operandi</i> also.</p>
