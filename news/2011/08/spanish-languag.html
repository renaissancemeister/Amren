<h1>Spanish-Language Media Suffering Less Than Mainstream Outlets</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, August 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Spanish-language media remain important to Latinos in the United States and suffered smaller declines than mainstream outlets in 2010, according to a study released by the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>English-language dailies had a 5 percent drop in circulation between March and September 2010 compared with the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Hispanic dailies actually increased their circulation by 1.9 percent and their finances &#8220;also appear to have improved after a rough 2009,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Television networks broadcasting in Spanish had an even more positive year. Univision&rsquo;s audience, for example, continued to grow, and on some occasions in 2010 &#8220;even surpassed one or more of the English-language networks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Magazines and Hispanic radio stations also showed growth. The number of Spanish-language radio stations grew by 8 percent, from 1,224 in 2008 to 1,323 in 2009, the most recent year for which figures are available.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The analysis found that the digital divide between Latinos and whites continued in 2010. Last year, 65 percent of Latinos and 66 percent of African Americans had Internet access compared with 77 percent of whites.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure their financials have improved greatly. After all, drug cartels don&rsquo;t just sit on those bales of cash they make off of us. they probably bought themselves a media outlet or two.</p>

<p>Interesting to say the least. The programming on Univision makes American Idol and Jerry Springer appear cerebral by comparison. The six o&rsquo;clock news isn&rsquo;t abjectly terrible in terms of content (except for its &#8220;down on their luck sob story&#8221; slant on people about to be deported or denied their &#8220;human rights&#8221;), but in order to get viewers to watch the news, it seems like they have to do a syncretic fusion of newscasting with the Sports Illustrated Swim Suit annual competion edition. Says a lot about the mentality of the viewers. But the chicas are HOT!!</p>

		<p>The reason for this is because Spanish-language Media (SLM) are Latino-centric and focus on the Latino community. Furthermore, the SLM doesn&rsquo;t try and shove blacks and liberal causes down Hispanic&rsquo;s throats the way the English-speaking U.S. media constantly does. </p>
<p>Mainstream liberal, English-speaking media outlets are losing their audiences by leaps and bounds because people are just fed up with the liberal agenda and the false perception of blacks as peaceful, idyllic, scholarly people who unjustly face discrimination that is so obviously a lie. </p>

		<p>That is because Spanish media does not constantly tell Spanish speakers that they are the worst people in history, responsible for all the problems of the earth, despicable, inherently evil and deserving of extermination blah blah blah.</p>
<p>No wonder hispanics like Spanish media.  It just provides news and entertainment. It doesn&rsquo;t constantly express hatred and loathing for its customers.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t the owners of English media ever take a basic marketing or sales class in their Ivy League schools?</p>

		<p>Where I work, there are no more drug stores, but these crappy little places called &#8216;bodegas.&rsquo;  You won&rsquo;t find any english language papers of any kind.  They usually have 2-3 spanish language &#8216;rag-mags&rsquo; or gossip type periodicals.</p>
<p>I work around a lot of latinos.  Almost half the radio stations are in spanish now.  I flip the dial every now and then to see what english radio stations are left.</p>
<p>The rub is this:  I am located almost a thousand miles north of the Mexican border.</p>

		<p>Spanish-language media is prospering because it  is subsidized by the English-language media.  On my basic cable plan, I have to pay for about a dozen Spanish channels in which I have no interest.  Were it not for this subsidy, I seriously doubt that the Spanish-language TV would even exist in Chicago.</p>

		<p>You can bet that these &#8220;hispanic&#8221; stations promote and talk about taking us over. In fact, I KNOW they do. Civil War Two (read the book) is on the horizon, but most Whites are too lame to even acknowledge it. Most will just blame themselves for being so &#8220;racist&#8221; and surrender.</p>

		<p>Another thing is the girls.  Ever seen Sabado Gigante?  Think Playboy cerca 1960. Then there are the woman newscasters.  If you think English women news casters show a lot of cleavage, check out the Spanish language gals.</p>
<p>Tip to high school Spanish teachers.  Tell your students to start watching Spanish language news.  The Spanish grades of the boys will soar.</p>
<p>One thing, they show better movies with far less commercials than AMC, TBS etc.  I&rsquo;ve given up on AMC,110 minutes of movie and 90 minutes of commercials.</p>

		<p>Spanish language television market already is controlled via Univision Communications by a White foreign national living in the United States Haim Saban. (Personal friend of the Clintons, and one of the leading whales in terms of Democrat party fundraising.)<br>

WOW!<br>
By comparison: We usually consider the German Invasion of Russia to be the biggest military undertaking in History&hellip;Certainly the war in the east was gargantuan.</p>
<p>Consider this comparison:</p>
<p>Axis troops invading Russia in June 1941: About FOUR MILLION.<br>
Distance between BERLIN and MOSCOW: 999 miles. (German patrols got to the suburbs of Moscow in December, before their bitter, deathly retreat. Back and forth the war went, ending in the Battle of Berlin four years later, the largest battle in the history of the world, and the utter destruction of Germany as a state.).</p>
<p>NOW;</p>
<p>MEXICANS IN THE USA IN 2011: 20 million or more. Total Mestizo invasion&hellip;40 million?<br>
Distance, Mexico City to Lewiston, Maine: 2,923 miles.<br>
Mestizos openly flout all our laws and even kill us, yet don&rsquo;t even get deported&hellip; they are given jobs, and a pass on most criminal offenses, so as not to be hindered&hellip;</p>
<p>Puts things into perspective, huh?<br>
The Mestizo invasion of America is the largest conquest- by far- in the history of the world. And the most successful.<br>

		<p>In reference to comment #3, I&rsquo;ve never seen actual numbers that indicated whites were abandoning the MSM. (If there were I&rsquo;d expect the media to keep a tight lid on it. Can you really see them writing an article called &#8220;Is the MSM losing its white audience?&#8221;)  We hear this refrain often, that whites are turning their backs on the MSM, but do we know that is really happening and at what rate?</p>
<p>I question the rate at which this is happening when apparently ~45% percent of whites approve(?!) of Obama&rsquo;s performance.  If again, there&rsquo;s any truth to that number.  If there is, it kind of puts a hole in the theory that whites are abandoning the MSM, at least by leaps and bounds.  Unfortunately, there is a lot of unlearning that has to take place in whites, recovery from liberal brainwashing that to this day is still dominant in education and is even now only barely, feebly starting to be questioned (like critical race theory). In terms of whites abandoning the MSM, I would expect gains to painfully slow here unfortunately.  If there&rsquo;s any pattern that we see with any consistency, it&rsquo;s that we don&rsquo;t &#8220;wake up&#8221; to problems until it&rsquo;s basically too late to do anything about them. Sickening, but true. </p>

		<p>Here is another example of the demise of the anti White MSM.  </p>
<p>Good news!</p>
<p>Washington Post closes local news bureaus </p>
<p>Thursday, September 01, 2011 Reuters </p>
<p>Lucas Shaw<br>
The Washington Post has decided to close all its local bureaus except those in the capitals of Virginia and Maryland. The Post, whose parent company reported a 50 percent drop in profits for its second quarter in early August, closed all of its national bureaus in 2009. <br>
