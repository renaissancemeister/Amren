<h1><a href="/ImageLibrary/Groups/ccCouncil/2011-PDF/Jointstatefairstatement-Donova.pdf">We&rsquo;re Reaping the Harvest We&rsquo;ve Sown</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release by Milwaukee Aldermen Bob Donovan and Joe Dudzik, Aug. 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Aldermen Bob Donovan and Joe Dudzik of Milwaukee have released the following statement about the violence at the Wisconsin State Fair:</p>
<p>As elected officials, we are shocked and concerned about the senseless violence displayed by the large mob outside State Fair Park last night. On behalf of our city, we apologize to the victims and good patrons who endured or witnessed such horrific behavior.</p>
<p>Sadly, what transpired near State Fair Park last night is only the most recent mob riot spawned by a culture of violence that has been brewing in Milwaukee for some time.</p>
<p>And let&rsquo;s face it, it also has much to do with a deteriorating African American culture in our city.</p>
<p>Are large groups of Hispanics or Hmong going out in large mobs and viciously attacking whites?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We are reaping the harvest that we&rsquo;ve sown.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>There are repercussions for the staggering illegitimacy rate in our African American community.</p>
<p>There are repercussions for having little to no positive male involvement in the lives of African American children.</p>
<p>There are repercussions for single-parent homes where children aren&rsquo;t properly supervised, and where they aren&rsquo;t held responsible for their actions.</p>
<p>There are repercussions for a staggering, decades-long near 50% unemployment rate for African American males in our city.</p>
<p>There are repercussions for having a failing public school system, and an outdated juvenile justice system.</p>
<p>There are repercussions for having one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in the U.S., and for having kids raising kids.</p>
<p>The community was shocked when the violent mob of African American youths attacked white people in Kilbourn Reservoir Park on July 3. Then, a few eyebrows were raised at the F-bombs and shocking disregard and disrespect for Milwaukee police officers shown by a large and unruly group of African Americans at N. Richards St. and W. North Ave. last Saturday night.</p>
<p>And now this horrific mob violence near State Fair Park.</p>
<p>But for those who live in some city neighborhoods, this violence has been like a steady rain for far too many years now. And the reality is this summer it seems we have five or six shootings each and every weekend!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this behavior is now all too common in some parts of the Milwaukee community.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to the older generation of African Americans in this city who remember when their community had one of the HIGHEST marriage rates in the city. Sadly, many of these same residents are now scared of their own children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Although we hope our law enforcement agencies are able to bring some of the thugs who were involved in these attacks to justice, no amount of millions of dollars in government spending or resources is going to truly address this problem.</p>
<p>We can no longer wish this violence would just go away, and we cannot ignore it; we must see it for what it truly is.</p>
<p>We cannot begin to address the underlying causes of the violence without change. We believe that change must come from within the African American community, where new seeds must be sown.</p>

		<p>Excuse me, but we&rsquo;re reaping the harvest that WHO has sown? These repercussions they talk about STILL sounds like they are somehow whiteys fault. Unbelieveable they continue to ignore the obvious. Let me just add a few more repercussions to the list.  </p>
<p>There are repercussions for:</p>
<p>The decades long liberal aganda that teach white children their ancestors were evil and they should be ashamed, thus giving black children a reason to hate them.</p>
<p>Constantly bowing down and apologizing to blacks for the silliest slight.</p>
<p>Constantly inflating the black male ego.</p>
<p>Making it impossible for a white person to speak the truth about race/black violence without severe repercussions.</p>
<p>Constantly calling white people RACISTS!, again for the silliest of reasons, causing them to walk on eggshells around blacks.</p>
<p>TV shows, ads, and any other media outlets constantly portraying the black guy as the smart, strong,cool one beside the goofy, uncool, weak white guy.</p>
<p>Constantly making excuses for blacks and NEVER admitting the truth about ANYTHING where they are concerned.</p>
<p>And please guys, do you really think they WANT to change anything? Just look at all they have been given and they are going BACKWARD! But, you&rsquo;re right about one thing at least. NO amount of money will fix this.</p>

<p>No millions of dollars in compensation for white victims of crime, it would certainly help these victims? That would be quite a change if this were the response. It would be harder to imagine a bigger change. All these two men do is call for more care and concern for people of color, they just choose a different approach to get there. If the white victims of crime aren&rsquo;t the priority in this case, are they really calling for change or for more of the same? Something tells me this problem wont be solved until this becomes s priority. </p>

		<p>Question:</p>
<p>If the grandparents were so responsible and just, how did they let it deteriorate to such an extent that it has?</p>
<p>Blacks used to be far less violent, but so did whites 50 years ago too. The gap has remained the same, the only difference is that all groups today at far more violent than in the 50s.</p>

		<p>At least these men have made it plain that blacks are the attackers.  They have, of course, added the same silly, threadbare arguments that only the very young and inexperienced could possibly believe.  Public officials still believe they have to deflect accusations of racism, and so they repeat by rote the phrases that everyone expects.  When people make clear that they want straight talk about race and elect race-realists, then these nonsense-spouting pols will sing a different tune.  <br>

<p>And those seeds should be sown in Africa. Or just possibly Haiti, Jamaica, or other places where Africans are, for all intents and purposes, the only people living there. If payments are needed to induce the recipient countries to accept these seed sowers, by all means, pay for it.</p>
<p>The problem will not go away as long as the problem makers are here.</p>

<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t your heart go out to the WHITE victims? Oh no, just more &#8220;insight&#8221; from you two fellows telling US that somehow we are still to blame for black failures.</p>
<p>The so called older generation of blacks are responsible for bringing up their own kids, who in turn, had these black grandkids who are out of control. Now that they are older and more feeble you make more excuses for them. Blacks have NEVER had the moral fortitude that you are eluding to. It all goes back to RACE, something that people like you try to ignore. We cannot change what has been inbred from the beginning of time. </p>
<p> Btw, I do not buy into your &#8220;facts&#8221; that the older blacks don&rsquo;t feel the same way about Whites as do their grandkids and that they had a very high marriage rate. Even if married, black men and women cheated every chance they got, not to mention incest was rampant. Just ask Oprah and Tyler Perry.</p>
<p>Most of us know that blacks back then were always a problem within their own communities, which segregation (thank God) kept us from hearing about and living among. The slaves were just as bad.</p>
<p>Quit trying to romanticize of how the blacks &#8220;used&#8221; to be.</p>

		<p>This is a start, but they quickly go to the weasel use of the term failing public school system and justice system. One question Aldermen who the hell makes these system&rsquo;s fail?  A good rule of thumb in this day and age is to avoid anything with the word PUBLIC before it, such as park, pool, beach, transit, housing, and school. Just one exception Public Library. I have a feeling that it won&rsquo;t be but a few day&rsquo;s until they start expalining, clarifing, and finally saying I really didn&rsquo;t mean what I said and if anybody is offended I am sorry.</p>

		<p>The Great Society was a set of domestic programs suggested or enacted in the United States on the initiative of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Two main goals of the Great Society social reforms were the elimination of poverty and racial injustice. New major spending programs that addressed education, medical care, urban problems, and transportation were launched during this period. The Great Society in scope and sweep resembled the New Deal domestic agenda of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but differed sharply in types of programs enacted.<br>
 <br>
8 Trillion Dollars have been spent on &#8220;Great Society&#8221; programs.</p>

		<p>Everyday there is more and more of it.</p>
<p>Everyday they (blacks) become bolder and bolder.</p>
<p>Everyday they increase the violence they impose upon innocent White People.</p>
<p>They are at war with us, in any other country they would be called guerrillas and the USA would be sending in troops to defend them.</p>
<p>These groups are too much for most local police departments to control and are more of a military matter than just a police matter. I&rsquo;d say when some of these black and hispanic GANGS have over 2000 members they are a war group against America.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m terribly sorry, but this is one harvest I have not &#8220;sown&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not responsible for black unemployment.<br>
I am not responsible for a &#8220;failing public school system&#8221;.<br>
I am not responsible for black out-of-wedlock pregnancies.<br>
I am not responsible for black illiteracy.<br>
I am not responsible for an &#8220;outdated&#8221; juvenile justice system.</p>
<p>The reason I am responsible for absolutely none of these things - not one - is because I not only have no control over any of them, but I have been told with a consistency approaching 100% for my entire adult life that my opinion on these subjects is not wanted.</p>
<p>I would like to ask these dingbats who&rsquo;s sole concession to honesty on this incident was to identify the violent attackers, if &#8220;we&#8221; are reaping the harvest &#8220;we&#8221; have sown, then who in blue blazes is the &#8220;we&#8221; in this story?<br>

<p>The &#8220;liberries&#8221; are NOT an exception. They&rsquo;re full of blacks who use &#8220;da puters&#8221; to look at MySpace, Facebook and black-on-White porn. It follows that libraries aren&rsquo;t quiet anymore and the librarians are afraid to enforce the rules for fear of violence or being called racist.</p>

Seems like the city had incidents before the fair that should have alerted them that the fair would be a problem.  Could have had N.G. or more police protection.

		<p>These attacks are happening almost every day and with no precipitating event. It seems they occur more often at large events but I am thinking that if they actually have an excuse like a police involved shooting or etc that we could see something on the order of the Rwandan genocide. only in Rwanda the blacks mostly only had knives not guns like they do here. I think the police chief here finally addressed the racial component only because 7 officers were injured. Americans attacking Americans this is truly a state of civil war. I am disappointed that i have not heard one major or even minor talk radio host addressed these attacks.</p>

		<p>The roots of this have been going on for a long time in Milwaukee. I was reading a 1975 Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel article on Google News. They were talking about the epidemic of violence and misbehavior among students at all-black Washington High School. My parents went to that same school in the 1950s when it was all white and they describe it like Happy Days or Leave It To Beaver.</p>

		<p>The winds of change are blowing across Africa as Hillary said once in some African rest stop.  We have spent a lot of money and effort changing the diapers of black folk and here we are.  What happened was open war and nothing else.  They got away with it basically and they will be back for more.  If the police cant handle it then they need to close the fair as a public safety nuisance.</p>

<p>We are a third world country moving towards great violence and  sufferring and you can can thank every politican for this denegration of our  nation and it&rsquo;s peoples.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let them shirk their role in this destruction; hold them responsible and make it known.  Vote them out, change congress, and change your city officials, change or die.  We will probably die in the process, but in the end possibly survive.</p>

<p>Blacks are not less violent.  They are able to carry out their natural violent tendencies because they are no longer held accountable for their actions and are able to blame white racism and oppression.  The media and DOJ are 100% complicit in excusing black mob violence, especially violence against whites.</p>
<p>The difference is that 50 years ago, black were held in check.  At the first whiff of black violence, the authorities and local residents  would have cracked down immediately, met the mob with guns drawn and let them know in no uncertain terms there would be hell to pay if white men and children were attacked in any way shape or form.  Now, whites protecting their children and families against black mayhem are the ones being prosecuted.  </p>
<p>The only way to stop this is with force, deadly force if need be.  The government and police authorities will not protect us, the DOJ will not prosecute black assaults on whites and the media will not report so it is up to us to put a stop to these vicious assaults against us.  If not us, who will?  These racial hate assaults and violence directed at whites will continue to escalate to the point of killing soon and MUST be ended NOW.</p>
