<h1><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/us/18king.html?scp=2&amp;sq=martin%20luther%20king%20jr.%20memorial%20and%20king%20family&amp;st=cse">Family of Dr. King Charged Group Building His Monument</a></h1>
 

<p>New York Times, April 17, 2009</p>

</div> 



<p>The family of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has charged the foundation building a monument to him on the Mall about $800,000 for the use of his words and image, an arrangement one leading scholar said Dr. King would have found offensive.</p>
<p>The memorial, including a 28-foot sculpture depicting Dr. King, is being paid for almost entirely with private money in a fund-raising campaign led by the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation. {snip}</p>
<p>The foundation has been paying the King family for the use of Dr. King&rsquo;s words and image in its fund-raising materials. The family has not charged for the use of his likeness in the monument.</p>
<p>David J. Garrow, a Cambridge University historian who won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography of Dr. King, said he did not know of any other descendants that had been paid such a fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think any family would be so thrilled to have their forefather celebrated and memorialized in D.C. that it would never dawn on them to ask for a penny,&#8221; Mr. Garrow said, adding that Dr. King would have been &#8220;absolutely scandalized by the profiteering behavior of his children.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement to The A.P., Intellectual Properties said that the proceeds it receives go to the King Center in Atlanta and that the arrangement was made out of concern that fund-raising for the monument would undercut donations to the center.</p>
