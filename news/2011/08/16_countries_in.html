			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, August 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In an effort to ensure their citizens are treated fairly in Alabama, 16 nations, including Mexico, filed briefs against the state&rsquo;s controversial new immigration law that has already drawn fire from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Edward Still, a Birmingham attorney who filed the brief, told The Montgomery Advertiser that the nations &#8220;want to have one immigration law and not 50.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexico has an interest in protecting its citizens and ensuring that their ethnicity is not used as basis for state-sanctioned acts of bias and discrimination,&#8221; the brief said, according to the paper.</p>
<p>{snip} Besides the DOJ&rsquo;s lawsuit, the Roman Catholic Church, three dozen plaintiffs represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center have all filed lawsuits against the state&rsquo;s governor, The Montgomery Advertiser reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A 16-nation brief is different from a lawsuit and in many respects is symbolic without much legal weight.</p>
<p>Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay are named on the brief.</p>

		<p>The hypocrisy of Mexico with harsh, strictly enforce immigration laws of its own.  And btw, try being a non-Mexican and buying property or getting a job in that country of brotherly concern.  Of course the US will take this abuse, and maybe pay out compensation to some deserving Mexicans.</p>

		<p>Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Mexico can worry about their own laws and immigration problems. Notice they are all South of the border.</p>
<p>Since when did our government get so spineless that other nations are telling us what to do? Last time I checked Mexico had very strict immigration laws, I don&rsquo;t remember the US ever saying anything negative about that.</p>

		<p>The suit must be thrown out by any sane judge. Other nations have no right to dictate our own laws to us. We and we alone have the right to determine who can and cannot live in our own borders. Mexcio et al&rsquo;s opinion on our immigration laws is worth less than nothing.</p>
<p>Too bad we live in the Age of Confusion where right and wrong are totally inverted.</p>
<p>Part of me wonders if this is divine punishment for US bullying across the world? I&rsquo;m sure no one on this site would be surprised if the lawsuit was taken seriously by a US judge and not dismissed like the hateful farce that it is.</p>

<p>Actually, those nations want America to have no immigration law, not one.  But who am I to fuss over a rounding error?</p>

		<p>Yes symbolic because it is none of these countries business.  Leftist Catholic churches that lobby for illegal immigrants should have their tax exempt status revoked.  All they care about is getting more Catholics in the country to sit in their pews and give donations.  And I say this as a Catholic.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t like it? Don&rsquo;t move to America. It wouldn&rsquo;t break my heart. What kind of backwards person would risk their life escaping their home country because it is so dangerous and gang infested, then desperately try to turn their new country into their old one? That just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me at all.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s nonsense - since when can a foreign country sue a state of the U.S.?  It&rsquo;s just symbolism and display, kind of like a male bird does when trying to attract a mate.  If our federal guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t was enforcing the laws that are on the books already, there&rsquo;d be no problem.  But, spinless BO isn&rsquo;t about to do the right thing in this matter.  Ergo, the states have to take the situation into their own hands.  And hey - maybe that&rsquo;s not so bad.  All you Mexicans, Central Americans, and South Americans, IF YOU DON&rsquo;T LIKE IT THEN STAY HOME!!!  We don&rsquo;t need you.  We got problems enough without adding you.</p>

		<p>Ok, lets clarify something that I think even die-hard liberals should be able to understand.  We won&rsquo;t have 50 different immigration laws.  Aside from the fact that most, if not all states will have virtually identical laws, they won&rsquo;t enforce immigration law.  They arrest law breakers, turn them over to ICE, and ICE enforces immigration law.  Many local police forces throughout the country already cooperate with ICE under a federal program.  Officers receive training in immigration law and are authorized to detain illegals.  Individual states do not have the power, nor do they even plan to deport anyone.  They do, however, have the authority to arrest law breakers and inform ICE if they are illegal.  Not infroming ICE is tantamount to harboring.  </p>

		<p>How about us countersuing these countries for urging their people to break into OUR country? These banana republics need to have every cent from our government cut off. That would straighten them up. Military on our borders and stop all benefits to foreign lawbreakers.</p>

		<p>What am I missing here? </p>
<p>Americans and America should tell these nations to &#8220;get back in their box&#8221;. Who the hell do they think they are to demand anything from you? They are not Americans and should not be able to dictate your laws, especially on immigration! </p>
<p>Tell them to &#8220;Foxtrot Oscar&#8221;! They are surely taking the proverbial urine out of you all. They are perhaps seeing a weakness and pouncing on it. They are getting ideas above their station and need to be knocked back down, hard. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you have this saying in America, but sometimes we say to our children &#8220;stop your crying - or we will give you something to cry about!&#8221;. </p>
<p>Why not install even harsher measures that explicitly lay out that you intend to keep as many out and deport as many as possible? - let them become thankful for small mercies and give those nations and those pro-immigration people something to really cry about. </p>
<p>They need putting back in their box, and you (like the rest of us whites in the West)need to start figuring out how to unapologetically assert ourselves against these people. </p>

		<p>It makes perfect sense Blazin&rsquo; Caucasian when you remember these darkie invaders want to dispossess us of our rights, possessions freedoms, lands, futures and lives. That is why they come here, for the same reason the Muslim hordes have invaded my ancestors Ukrainian and Russian homelands to kill, dispossess and enslave millions of Slavs.</p>

<p>Actually, if you&rsquo;re not a mexican citizen you can&rsquo;t own property in Mexico. And they are VERY aggressive in removing Guatamalan and other south-of-the-border immigrants from their country. With the drug wars going on now, though, perhaps that&rsquo;s no longer a problem for them. </p>

		<p>Why haven&rsquo;t our courts told these psuedo-Latin nations that they have &#8220;no standing&#8221;?  It is bad enough our federal government sues our states but what gives these 3rd rate countries the right to sue our states?  If WE want fifty immigration laws that is OUR business, the theirs! Our federal government not only doesn&rsquo;t protect our states but actually inflcits harm on them.  And now foreign governments are allowed to use our courts to destroy our system of government.  One more term of Sotero and the &#8220;Supremes&#8221; will be majority &#8220;death to America&#8221; supporters and it will be truly over.</p>
