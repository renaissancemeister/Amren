<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White infants are on the verge of being displaced as the majority of newborns now that nearly half of babies in the USA are ethnic and racial minorities.</p>
<p>Only 50.2% of babies under age 1 are white and not Hispanic, according to the 2010 Census  &mdash;  a sharp decline from 57.6% just 10 years earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are almost at a minority-majority infant population,&#8221; says Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, who analyzed the latest Census data. &#8220;We probably have passed it since the Census was taken&#8221; in April 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steady growth in the number of young U.S. Hispanics who have more children than whites is shrinking the ranks of non-Hispanic whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In rural areas, the number of white children declined by more than 1 million or almost 10% from 2000 to 2010, says Kenneth Johnson, demographer at the University of New Hampshire&rsquo;s Carsey Institute.</p>
<p>The number of young white women of child-bearing age is declining while there is an increase in minority women of child-bearing age, Johnson says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The nationwide changes are redefining who is a minority and who is not.</p>
<p>&#8220;These little babies &hellip; by the time they get to be in their 20s and 30s, the current racial and ethnic categories &hellip; won&rsquo;t have anything close to the meaning that (they have) today,&#8221; Frey says. &#8220;When they think about white majority, it&rsquo;ll be something in the history books.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is what the leftists wanted.  Massive legal and illegal immigration of nonwhites, feminism, socialism, marxism, white guilt, oppressive taxation on middle class whites have combined to destroy the United States.  Of course, compared to much of Europe, where white populations are below replacement level, whites in the US are on much more solid ground.  Whites will go from hated majority to hated minority with the insane left leading the way.  </p>

		<p> One can detect something like a lip-smacking satisfaction in the reporting of this sad fact, as if the writer were saying, &#8220;Hey, you White racist blankety-blanks, you&rsquo;ll be the minority in a few more years, then you&rsquo;ll find out how it feels!&#8221; Note the writer&rsquo;s name is Haya Al-Nasser, which tells us that he or she is probably Arab and possibly Muslim. Which means that I&rsquo;m probably right about the mindset of the reporter.</p>
<p> It would have been a much more interesting article if Al-Nasser had gone to the trouble of finding a few experts on demographics, etc., who would hazard opinions on what this downfall of the American Caucasian might mean for the Land of the Free. But of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t do that; might get stuck with some &#8220;wrong&#8221; answers! </p>

		<p>This is a very hopeful article by Haya El Nasser.</p>
<p>The Left despises mathematics when it comes to school scores, employment rates, IQ testing, the true $300,000 taxpayer cost of a &lsquo;green job&rsquo;, welfare rates, the world population bubble, or the unsustainability of a fiat currency. However, this same group worships mathematical models when it comes to demographic projections.</p>
<p>These projections teach us that, as the world had 1 billion people in the year 1900 and ~7 billion people today, that there will be ~49 billion people in another hundred years.  Good luck with that one.</p>
<p>The problem with the Left&rsquo;s Logic is that while biology and economics cannot be divorced from mathematics, human demographics frequently are. One group with some former knowledge on this subject was surely the Carthaginians. </p>
<p>What can be accurately predicted is a fiat currency failure followed by the collapse of the social safety net. At that point we get to live through another round of history. Until then, spread all kinds of math and enjoy the prologue. </p>

		<p>When I was coming up in the 50&rsquo;s &amp; 60&rsquo;s, it was considered &#8220;the right thing to do&#8221; for a family to have 2 kids, one for each parent, and thus not contribute to eventual overpopulation.  We were WASPs and never considered the racial implications.  Blacks, Hispanics and Muslims procreate rapidly   &mdash;   I hope whites will abandon that old-timey limited-family concept and get busy!!!</p>

		<p>I just love how William Frey of Brookings is always a perpetual cheerleader for the demographic onsluaght being waged against his fellow whites. If the stupid party actually came to their senses and did away with automatic citizenship for the offspring of illegal aliens, we couldn&rsquo;t be near this dreadful tipping point to begin with. But their constant inaction on this matter is nothing short of treason. Like Pat Buchanan said, those people singing the praises of diversity today will be spending their golden years in a third world America. Good luck Mr Frey. </p>

		<p>So, this country is destroyed and invaded without firing a shot.  Congratulations to those who plotted to accomplish this.  We are presently living in the decline and disappearance of an advanced civilization.  To seal this country&rsquo;s fate for sure, the anti-white brainwashing starts in the elementary school years.  Now the whites are eliminated in government by barry&rsquo;s executive orders and newly installed &#8220;diversity&#8221; agencies.  This is to ensure whites do not have any say and control in their own government.  Quite a well executed plan.</p>

In rural areas, the number of white children declined by more than 1 million or almost 10% from 2000 to 2010.&#8221;</i><br>
__________________________</p>
<p>Note too that many of those &#8220;white&#8221; babies, arbitrarily categorized as such by official statistics, would not  meet the definition of &#8220;white&#8221; that most Amreners would apply, nor even be considered &#8220;white&#8221; by the understanding of most people.  Thus, truly white babies are already very much the minority.</p>
<p>Note too the name of the journalist reporting this new statistic.<br>
So many of the journalists&rsquo; names that we see constantly today would not even have been considered American just a few decades ago, before massive non-European immigration began swamping us.</p>
<p>But the multy-culty advocates must be in ecstasy. At last! This is what they had dreamed of and worked for, for so long. Their dream is coming true&hellip; a non-white, non-Christian, non-Euro   America!</p>
<p>Thank you, Congressman Emanuel Celler, et al.</p>

		<p>Yes, but 40 percent of Hispanic are white. And since Hispanics<br>
are 16 percent of the U.S. population, then 6.4 percent of Americans are white-hispanic. So though minority babies are almost the majority(since whites  are minority if they are Hispanic), white babies are about 56.6 percent (50.2+6.4)  of all<br>
babies in the United States(assuming that white hispanic and non-white hispanic have babies at the same rate. . But still whites babies will be majority for a long time as white hispanics are white). </p>

They might be white enough for you but not for me. The average Mexican in the US southwest is at least 3/4 and frequently 7/8 Indian. Genetically, their European content is very much overwhelmed by their Native (Mayan, etc) content.  </p>
<p>And if that weren&rsquo;t enough, these mesoamericans also don&rsquo;t THINK of themselves as white. They HATE gringos like us, so why on earth would they want to identify with us? There&rsquo;s just no percentage in it. Anything white is out of fashion; anything nonwhite is in fashion. As far as they&rsquo;re concerned, Whitenss is a &#8220;dead brand&#8221;, an obsolete product that nobody wants to be associated with any more. They think we&rsquo;re the past and they&rsquo;re the future. And quick look round any maternity ward in California suggests they&rsquo;re right. </p>

		<p>Actually, since our gov&rsquo;t counts Arabs, Turks, North Africans and many other groups as &#8216;white&rsquo;, I believe that the figure is wrong and that white babies were surpassed years ago. </p>
<p>Look around you.  Unless you live in one of the few remaining 100% white towns, you will probably notice black and brown babies all over.  If you live in urban areas, white children under ten will be so rare as to be a novelty.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, you almost NEVER see a white face under twenty.  The last time I saw a white baby, I marvelled for a moment.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s keep one thing in mind as we contemplate the demographic future of the United States. In general, the Anglo-European white population of the United States is not declining. Between now and 2050, it may even increase slightly. All of this manic, out-of-breath discussion of how whites will be less than a majority by some certain year is intended to make people believe that the Anglo-European population of the United States is in the process of vanishing. Nothing could be further from the truth. What these people want to do is justify an intensifying program of anti-white discrimination for the future.  </p>

		<p>The Austro Hungarian empire invented the welfare state for its people and anyone who entered the country.  All the poor of the neighboring countries moved to the empire to get welfare while they maintained their own language and customs.  The country tried to function in several different languages to help them.  The native population was subject to higher and higher taxes to support the welfare state and could not afford to have large families.  Meanwhile the immigrants breed rapidly to get more welfare.  All sound familiar?  The empire collapsed into chaos and is no longer remembered.  That is our fate unless we change things.</p>

		<p>Hispanics are not 40 percent white. Unless of course you are talking about the New White which is like the New Blond. Everyone can be white- I have seen black women with Nordic blond extensions. I have been on black racialist sites where they re-frame white for themselves and cut white Europeans out of the white category.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a word you use&hellip;.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that most Hispanics are actually mulattos due to the slave trade and the lax rules about race mixing.</p>

		<p>This is inevitable inasmuch as minority births are subsidized freely (as celebrated in the rap song, &#8220;It&rsquo;s Free, Swipe Your EBT&#8221;) whereas most white couples have to prepare and plan for their children. Many white couples limit the size of their families to a number that they feel that they can afford. Since many whites are no longer employed in agriculture, large families make little economic sense. </p>
<p>Minority birth rates would plummet if the government stopped subsidizing illegitimacy.</p>

		<p>As been already stated, the defintion of &#8216;white&rsquo; in the census is extremely broad. It often includes some Central Asian people and even Arabs(since Jews are often seen as White, the demographers felt that you need to add other semites for fairness too, despite the fact that most Ashkenazi Jews have at least 50 % european heritage and Arabs do not).</p>
<p>The real White infant population could easily be 40-42 % in reality.</p>
<p>As for the situation in America, this was already in the cards 20-30 years ago. Whites are now doomed in the sense of a strong majority. This will mean that racial consciousness will undoubtedly rise but to what avail? America will now never become a European country unless somekind of disaster sets in and I certainly do not wish to see that at all. </p>
<p>When the multiculturalists at times say that the world used to be multicultural in a sense, that was true. That&rsquo;s the reason why the nation-state was built: it was to prevent ethnic perpetual conflict.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve thrown away the last 150 years of progress. We can debate who/what groups are to blame. I certainly think that without the owners of the media - you know who they are - we wouldn&rsquo;t even get near this situation but somekind of deterioation was inevitable.</p>
<p>Beside, there was no real pushback once these voices were raised in the 50s, 60s and so on. So we were weak culturally and spritiually even before the 60s.</p>
<p>People sometimes refer to the 50s when whites were normally sound and normal in their convictions. That is true, but whites were not *strong* in their convictions in any sense. It was just vague, which is why the diversity train got off to speed, because it faced no real resistance.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Well we won&rsquo;t see a South Africa, that&rsquo;s for sure. Europe will stay be quite, but not as much, monolithic. Same with Australia, Canada. </p>
<p>Western nations, due to their demographics, will most likely be severely weakned economically and culturally until there is a strong European voice. It is already happening in Europe. </p>
<p>In America, you&rsquo;ve paid for the corrupt two-party system which has essentially check-mated you. In Europe, it is much easier to gain influence because once you get to 5-10 %, you tend to have influence. </p>
<p>As for the future? Well, I think it is likely that we will see tremendous amount of conflict. It&rsquo;s certainly possible that we&rsquo;ll see through this, but the price will be heavy. Whites have controlled Africans and mestizos before(as well as Arabs and others), but the South African experiment shows that being a 10-15 % minority is doomed in the long run. You need a solid majority or at least a very large minority(something Euro-America will soon have in perhaps no more than 15 years when looking at total population) to make anything out of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see anything unless there is some resource crisis whether it&rsquo;s climate change, peak oil or something similar.</p>
<p>But of course, if nanotechnology continues at it&rsquo;s pace, race could be largely nullified as all gaps could be filled by new, advanced technology instead. Anyone who keeps an eye on these developments know that we are much closer than people realize, 15-20 years at most. About the same time as Euro-America slips into minority status. So for me, we could actually end up seeing an increasingly strained slog the next 10 years or so, befor the situation slowly starts to improve(or if you wish, become nullified) and then eventually become obsolete.</p>
<p>The other version is a resource scare. And then Europeans all over will be forced to come together, probably together with Asians and/or other friendly populations. If, heavens forbid, this would happen then America will be an extremely unpleasant place to be compared to much more homogenous Europe(especially the Northern parts).</p>

		<p>We know that &#8220;white&#8221; in these statistics includes people from the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa who are not considered white in the real world. </p>

		<p>Most of the comments on this article make a sane person want to pull their hair out. There are White liberals cheering the decline of their own race and insisting, in fact demanding, we hand over our country and get over it already. Someone please tell me what&rsquo;s wrong with these people, because I just can&rsquo;t believe this kind of self destruction is from brainwashing, and indoctrination. I think they are mentally ill. They must be to make such ridiculous statements as I have read from this article. <br>
  </p>
<p>What will go down in the History books is how a once great nation went quietly into the night with the help, consent and encouragement of it&rsquo;s own government and people.</p>

<p>WHEN I WAS YOUNG: </p>
<p>When I was young, I remember hearing about the immigrants that came through Ellis Island .. They wanted to learn English. They wanted to breathe free. They wanted to become Americans. Now too many immigrants come here with demands. They demand to be taught in their own language. They demand special privileges  &mdash;  affirmative action. They demand ethnic studies that glorify their culture.</p>
<p>Remember when you vote next year that we need someone in the White House who will balance the budget and control illegal immigration. If we make all illegals, legal, then we have lost our country forever. Liberalism will have won and you will have a one party system forever. Redistribution of wealth will be the law. It is called socialism. Our country is heading in the wrong direction and we are doing it to ourselves without serious protest.</p>

&ldquo;When they think about white majority, it&rsquo;ll be something in the history books.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
History books? You mean those things that Dead White European Males used to write? When the mestizos and Africans who are numerically overtaking white people finally achieve their post-Caucasian Ameritopia, what makes you think these browns and blacks will have history books at all? Both are from peoples who, prior to contact with the white man some 500 years ago, had no books at all. Neither Amerinds nor Bantus ever developed written languages   &mdash;   let alone started writing history books. Why would they even bother keeping records of us dispossessed gringos and ofays when, in their natural state, they never even kept records of themselves or their own activities? These people don&rsquo;t have the same attitude towards History that we have. They have no &#8220;intellectual tradition&#8221; to speak of. </p>
<p>In the future, the most whites can expect in the way of recognition from the new &#8220;majority-minority&#8221; overlords of our post-Caucasian countries, will be wall-sized graffiti murals   &mdash;   cave-paintings done in Krylon   &mdash;   depicting that glorious day when the &#8220;Raza Revolucion&#8221; finally seized the reins of power by decisively defeating the hated and oppressive &#8220;yanqui&#8221; known as &#8220;Uncle Sam.&#8221; </p>

		<p>This will make the Democratic party much stronger in the future for sure. As a white male, kind of glad I was born 55 years ago knowing what the future is going to look like. We&rsquo;ll be one of the most politically socialist countries around.</p>
<p>Just wondering if we&rsquo;ll be put on reservations or just slaughtered/chased out   &mdash;   like in Zimbabwe. Perhaps most people will be mostly multi-racial through lots of sex? Maybe just cornered into remote rural regions of the country? Possibly like Brazil? </p>
<p>Hard to say, but the writing is on the wall. One thing I believe though, is that brown skinned people will miss us despite their denial. They&rsquo;ve done well sucking us dry, blaming us for all their problems; they will always dislike us, and that&rsquo;s a fact. Even the upscale kinds, like the Asians. It&rsquo;s kind of an en vogue, cultural favorite pasttime for all darker skin people to talk trash about whites.</p>
<p>Well, the party will end soon when they become the super majority. The complaining and mooching will end sooner than they think.   </p>

<p>We see your point, however, I feel compelled to point out that the conservative leaders of America just complained to China regarding their one baby rule, and that there should be no government control on birthing or abortion allowed - ever.  This too seems to be a blatant ignorance of how much the Chinese population would make percentage wise of that projected 49 billion.  The Chinese plan already appears to be colonization of Africa, Europe and North America.  There  are other mathematical certainties that would embarrassing to chronic conservative positions as well.  So it seems, both sides are quite capable of mathematical ignorance.  Or is it that they both only utilize it when it suits their particular ideology?</p>

		<p>Thanks blackwatcher I read third generation commie Cockburn&rsquo;s nonsense. I had to laugh.  Someone dumped a batch of The Progressive news paper the official publication of CPUSA in on a bench in the lobby of my local library.</p>
<p>I picked up the entire batch and dumped it in a trash can in the park next door.  Progressive picked the wrong neighborhood for their propaganda.  It is a wealthy Persian immigrant neighborhood.  They think blacks are barely human.</p>
<p>There was a robbery of a pedestrian on the main shopping street of the neighborhood recently.  Most are small shops and offices owned by Persians with a few chains.</p>
<p>The Persians got together and looked through all their video cams.  They managed to get footage of the mugging, the robberies and their car and license plate.  They ran off copies of these 3 black robbers and pasted them in every store window and telephone pole for 6 blocks.</p>
<p>The demographic change does not bode well for blacks.  It is only the White Americans who grovel to them.  Once we are gone the asians, hispanics and White immigrants like russians, aremenians and persians will destroy them.</p>

Besides, there was no real pushback once these voices were raised in the 50s, 60s and so on. So we were weak culturally and spritiually even before the 60s.<br>

People sometimes refer to the 50s when whites were sound and normal in their convictions. That is true, but whites were not *strong* in their convictions in any sense. It was just vague, which is why the diversity train got off to speed, because it faced no real resistance.<br>

<p>True enough.  But we were &#8220;weak&#8221; only because we were  overly self-confident. We had just won the 2nd WW;  the USA was at the peak of its strength, the dominant power; we had the highest standard of living; the best education and science;  the US dollar ruled the world. </p>
<p>Look at us now.  The dollar is collapsing, our industry has moved abroad,  our borders are meaningless, our debt is unpayable,  our schools are a shambles, our &#8220;culture&#8221; is gross and coarsened.  Whites are declining and face official discrimination at every turn.   We are being invaded and colonized by the whole world (non-whites preferred).

Meanwhile, others were planning and working hard to make it otherwise, while we slept.</p>

Look at the comment votes, the two people who posted something sane have up votes of well over a hundred.  The people who called them racist/disagreed are deep in the negative.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  </p>
<p>Can we stop with the defeatism please?  I don&rsquo;t want to read it on Amren, of all places.  If you&rsquo;re commenting here, you are no doubt aware of the problems facing whites.  The next step is growing a spine, taking a stand, and saying &#8220;no, this isn&rsquo;t going to happen.  Because I&rsquo;m not going to let it.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are plenty of solutions(to name but a few - separation, forcible or not, segregation, forming our own ethno-nation state, and last but not least violently expelling the lot of them) to the problem of massive non-whites in America, it&rsquo;s time to pick one and run with it.</p>
<p>For example, there&rsquo;s the Northwest Front(the Butler Plan - I just read about it today as a matter of fact, interesting that I haven&rsquo;t seen it mentioned on Amren before).  <a href="https://northwestfront.org/" rel="nofollow">https://northwestfront.org/</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with their anti-semitism(jew bashing just seems like such a pointless, stupid, waste of time - and I have nothing against them myself), but at least they&rsquo;re actually doing something about the problems we&rsquo;re facing instead of sitting back and moaning about our inevitable defeat and following extinction as a race.  That&rsquo;s more than I can say about the defeatists that seem to be everywhere on the Amren boards lately.  You wonder how it got this bad in the first place?  Look in a mirror.  </p>
<p>Sorry if that comes off as harsh, but quite frankly I&rsquo;ve become disgusted after reading the comments on several articles in a row.  Either find your missing spines or grow a new one.</p>

<p>If those wealthy shareholders really did care about their ownership-by-paper or ownership-by-legalism mechanisms, deeds, titles, contracts, etc., then they SHOULD care about the racial demographics of the United States.  The person who holds a deed to beachfront property in San Diego should want the city, state and country to be as white as possible.  You have a piece of paper saying you own the property.  Mexican drug gangs have guns.  Guess who &#8220;owns&#8221; your beachfront property now.  So much for your piece of paper.</p>

<p>Your own artesian well for when the city water supply is contaminated.  A generator of course because the city electricity crashes down all the time.  Sending the kids to boarding school in America so they will speak fluent English when they have to flee to America after the next revolution.</p>
<p>Sending your money to other countries to safe it from confistication from someone more corrupt, criminal and stronger than you.</p>
<p>Not paying income taxes of course but paying the equivalent in bribes to every goverment official and clerk you have to deal with.</p>
<p>Life at the top is not all that great in S. America.</p>

<p>They are plenty of countries where one can buy an authentic, not forged Dr. of medicine degree from an accredited often prestitious medical school.</p>
<p>Contact someone at the university.  Write a back dated letter asking for an application.  Your contact will start a file both electronic and paper.  He or she gives you an application form.  Back date it and fill it out.  They write a back dated acceptance letter.  You write a back dated letter stating that you will start classses.  Transcripts, financial details, tutition payments it all goes into the file.</p>
<p>The $5,000 US you pay is split between the clerks and administrators.  Viola!! an authentic medical or nursing degree and a guaranteed affirmative action job in the US because you are not White.</p>
<p>As for the US board exams, there are plenty of professional test takers. I personally know of a hispanic american hospital clerk who takes the LVN exam for $700.00 and the RN exam for $1,500.</p>
<p>She is mexican but mostly indian so she has asian cheekbones. Her skin is a light tan. She can pass for just about any kind of asian, hispanic, filipino indonesian whatever.</p>
<p>She only graduated from high school but she is very, very intelligent.  She just bought all those exam prep books and memorized all the questions and answers. We ask her why she doesn&rsquo;t go to nursing school.  It is too long and hard for her. Her husband makes a lot of money so she is content with her clerk&rsquo;s salary.<br>

		<p>I remember being at the zoo with my kids when a group of girls in school uniforms came in several women started going on and on about Catholics and birth control. &#8220;Just look at them, they all will have 4 or 5 kids when overpopulation is destroying the world.</p>
<p>I was so enraged I went over to the teacher and asked what school. It was not a catholic school.  It was an ultra prestige upper class girl&rsquo;s school.  Then I tracked down the woman who made the anti catholic slurs and told her off for her prejudice, discrimination and jumping to conclusions.</p>
<p>She defended herself by ranting about Catholics and birth control.</p>
<p>  So I told her she was prejudiced and stupid for assuming that any girls in white blouses and plaid skirts were Catholics.  At least 20 years ago and I still remember.</p>
<p>There were 2 editorials on the same page in the Los Angeles Times recently. One was the standard feminazi rant that we must stop having children or the earth would be detroyed.</p>
<p>Another was an editorial espousing open illegal immigration, college tuition and scholarships for illegals. It also defended anchor babies on the grounds that although their parents put them on welfare they must be fed and sheltered by the taxpayers because they are poor little children.</p>
<p>All over the front and first 5 pages were &#8220;feed the starving somalian&#8221; pleas.</p>
<p>That is why liberals are insane.  The editors who did the mock up saw no contradiction in putting those 3 totally contradictory items in the paper.<br>

		<p>Along with noting the racial demographics of the next generation, we should also take note of their socioeconomic characteristics as well.</p>
<p>Non-asian non-whites - especially hispanics and blacks - have extremely high rates of divorce and illegitimacy, especially compared to whites and asians. Just under a half of this next generation will be raised in single parent households, the vast majority by single mothers.</p>
<p>This will have massive consequences. Kids from single parent homes are far more likely to be raised in poverty, far more likely to never complete high school, far more likely to end up in jail. They will grow up to be uneducated, unskilled and poor.</p>
<p>Along with importing millions of Mexico&rsquo;s uneducated, unskilled poor, the next generation of hispanics, many of them children of illegal immigrants, will continue to be uneducated, unskilled and poor. </p>
<p>Given that most economists see this next decade as being one of painfully slow, near-stagnant growth at best, I think we&rsquo;re likely to see a transformation of the US over the next 20 years into a slow but steady downwardly-mobile slide into 2nd world status.</p>
<p>The majority-minority future of the US is one where a shrinking white middle class is squeezed between a tiny super rich overclass which has very little in common with how most of the country lives (and thus, very little allegiance to it), and a huge growing non-white underclass suffering pervasive underemployment and sucking up far more in public services than they contribute to in terms of taxes or productivity. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unstable path, to say the least, where the most likely outcome is further downward mobility, a slow and steady decline.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ugly looking future for white parents. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The empire collapsed into chaos and is no longer remembered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Austro Hungarian Empire was destroyed by Wilson and the treaty of Versailles.  The allies used the idea of &#8220;self determination&#8221; as a pretext to disassemble Austria Hungary.   </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lansing" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lansing</a></p>
<p>&#8220;A few weeks before the formal end of World War I, Lansing informed the crumbling Austro-Hungarian government that the Americans could no longer negotiate on the basis of Wilson&rsquo;s Fourteen Points. Lansing pointed out that since the Americans were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs, the tenth point, autonomy for the nationalities, was no longer valid. Within two weeks, Austria-Hungary was no more.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In fact the dissolution of the empire caused World War II by creating a huge power vacuum in central Europe.  If Austria Hungary had still existed Russia and Germany would have had powerful buffer state between them that probably would have prevented World WarII,at least on the Eastern Front. </p>
<p>History is replete with coincidences today for example the European Union is becoming the prime mover and shaker in Eastern Europe.  It is if you will a reincarnation of the Holy Roman Empire under Carolus Magnus aka Charlamange.</p>

		<p>I frankly don&rsquo;t buy all of these statistics about the inevitability of a declining White birthrate. This is just anecdotal evidence, of course, but I&rsquo;ve been seeing so many White families with three or more children, lately, and I live in Portland, Oregon - hardly a conservative or Christian stronghold.  These are well-educated, middle-class families, who are obviously *choosing* to have many children, not just falling into it, as it were. I always make a point of praising their large family.  </p>

<p>Kelly and Gil Bates, who already have 18 kids, are about to catch up to the Duggars, stars of the reality TV show 19 Kids and Counting. The Bateses, evangelical Christians from Tennessee, oppose using birth control. With a little help from hormones (and, they say, prayer), they&rsquo;re now pregnant with No. 19, and hope some day to have a 20th child. &#8220;It feels more normal to me to be pregnant than not be pregnant,&#8221; says Kelly Bates, 44. &#8220;I&rsquo;m happy holding a baby.&#8221; She might be ecstatic&hellip; but what about her kids?  </p>

<p>They might be white enough for you but not for me.</p>
<p><br>
First of all, almost everything you mentioned is a lie about &#8220;hispanics&#8221;.  The major demographic make up of those idiot Americans use the term hispanic for, is white.  I say IDIOT Americans because this term comes from cultural Marxism as a means to divide and conquer.  Nowhere else in the world is this term used.  Spanish speaking people are either white (mostly), black or Amerind.  Neither (unlike in the US) are allowed in white lands.  And by that I mean, death squads commonly cull them from white Spanish speaking lands.  Something you and yours simply don&rsquo;t have the stomach for but you are one day going to have to get used to if you plan on avoiding genocide.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those you would lump in with these are blue eyed, blonde Aryans who speak Spanish.  And far, far, FAR more white than you likely are.</p>
<p>Get over it already.  Figure it out.  There are whites who speak English.  But also whites who speak German, Italian, French, Dutch&hellip;..and SPANISH.</p>

I have lost more than one friend the past few years for speaking my mind, and I&rsquo;m sure you know being a race realist is a lonely place to be right now. But I also believe more Whites are waking to our plight and have high hopes we will come together in the near future and take action. When we do, I&rsquo;ll be right in the thick of things.</p>

		<p>As been already stated, the defintion of &lsquo;white&rsquo; in the census is extremely broad. It often includes some Central Asian people and even Arabs(since Jews are often seen as White, the demographers felt that you need to add other semites for fairness too, despite the fact that most Ashkenazi Jews have at least 50 % european heritage and Arabs do not).</p>
<p>The real White infant population could easily be 40-42 % in reality.</p>
<p>As for the situation in America, this was already in the cards 20-30 years ago. Whites are now doomed in the sense of a strong majority. This will mean that racial consciousness will undoubtedly rise but to what avail? America will now never become a European country unless some kind of disaster sets in and I certainly do not wish to see that at all.</p>
<p>When the multiculturalists at times say that the world used to be multicultural in a sense, that was true. That&rsquo;s the reason why the nation-state was built: it was to prevent ethnic perpetual conflict.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve thrown away the last 150 years of progress. We can debate who/what groups are to blame. I certainly think that without the owners of the media - you know who they are - we wouldn&rsquo;t even get near this situation but some kind of deterioration was inevitable.</p>
<p>Beside, there was no real push back once these voices were raised in the 50s, 60s and so on. So we were weak culturally and spiritually even before the 60s.</p>
<p>People sometimes refer to the 50s when whites were normally sound and normal in their convictions. That is true, but whites were not *strong* in their convictions in any sense. It was just vague, which is why the diversity train got off to speed, because it faced no real resistance.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Well we won&rsquo;t see a South Africa, that&rsquo;s for sure. Europe will stay be quite, but not as much, monolithic. Same with Australia, Canada.</p>
<p>Western nations, due to their demographics, will most likely be severely weakened economically and culturally until there is a strong European voice. It is already happening in Europe.</p>
<p>In America, you&rsquo;ve paid for the corrupt two-party system which has essentially check-mated you. In Europe, it is much easier to gain influence because once you get to 5-10 %, you tend to have influence.</p>
<p>As for the future? Well, I think it is likely that we will see tremendous amount of conflict. It&rsquo;s certainly possible that we&rsquo;ll see through this, but the price will be heavy. Whites have controlled Africans and mestizos before (as well as Arabs and others), but the South African experiment shows that being a 10-15 % minority is doomed in the long run. You need a solid majority or at least a very large minority (something Euro-America will soon have in perhaps no more than 15 years when looking at total population) to make anything out of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see anything unless there is some resource crisis whether it&rsquo;s climate change, peak oil or something similar.</p>
<p>But of course, if nanotechnology continues at it&rsquo;s pace, race could be largely nullified as all gaps could be filled by new, advanced technology instead. Anyone who keeps an eye on these developments know that we are much closer than people realize, 15-20 years at most. About the same time as Euro-America slips into minority status. So for me, we could actually end up seeing an increasingly strained slog the next 10 years or so, before the situation slowly starts to improve (or if you wish, become nullified) and then eventually become obsolete.</p>
<p>The other version is a resource scare. And then Europeans all over will be forced to come together, probably together with Asians and/or other friendly populations. If, heavens forbid, this would happen then America will be an extremely unpleasant place to be compared to much more homogenous Europe (especially the Northern parts).</p>

		<p>I know many here will slate me for negativity, but the fact is that White America has gone and gone forever.</p>
<p> No force on Earth can bring it back to life again.  Its demise is a concrete undeniable fact.Readers must accept it and cope with it, denial simply won&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p> I am not for one moment saying its a good thing or that I agree with it, but we must accept reality for what it is and not what we would like it to be.</p>
<p> That said, the only real moral of the story is just how did this state of affairs (from the confident unassailable White nation of 1950 to the present madhouse) actually come to pass.What lessons can be learned from a historic analysis of the failures and policy decisions that lead to this catastrophe.</p>
<p>  In my mind the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960 was probably the turning point.</p>

<p>Defeatism is saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s all lost - forever&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s just a hoax.</p>
<p>But realism is saying &#8216;it&rsquo;s all lost in the sense that we cannot regain what we once had without major conflict, possibly escalating to quite ugly things and face it, most people don&rsquo;t like or want violence(me included) so the only way to get there is somekind of major, sustained catastrophe and even then it&rsquo;s uncertain if the stress levels are high enough for a long enough time to get something going&rsquo;.</p>

You can&rsquo;t be at the top forever, and neither at the bottom forever. We&rsquo;ll get where we want to be one day, but the easy, painless and not least bloodless solutions are now over. </p>
<p>And this is a concern and a matter of mourning.  </p>

<p>Whites are few in numbers or a minority in many predominantly &#8216;black&rsquo; and &#8216;brown&rsquo; countries, yet they are happy and have no intention of leaving. These includes, Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, and many other countries. And there is no racial conflict in these countries between whites and non-whites. So whoever thinks that there will a race war between whites and non-whites in America are ignoring that whites are living among non-whites throughout the world peacefully. Many whites wont even know when they are no longer the majority as they  will feel that their mostly &#8216;white neighborhoods&rsquo; are representative of America. </p>

		<p>I think it is over, both in the US and Western Europe.  In order regain some freedom, in the case of the US that would mean sesession, the President of the US would have to be pro-white and willing to allow sesession of major parts of the US.  It would also mean whites getting off their moral high horse and using any means at their disposal to defeat our enemies.  It would mean whites realizing that non-white woman and children are also enemies and must be treated as such.  It would also mean that foreign countries that might wish to intervene against us in our struggle would have to truly believe that the nuclear powers, the US, UK and France, would be willing to use those weapons against any nation that attempted to stop us.</p>
<p>I do not believe we have it in us to do any of the above.  No US president will want to go down in history as the last.  A non-white president will have no qualms about killing us.  And look at all the whites killed in useless wars by Clinton and Bush, two nominally white presidents.  Our sense of morality is so ingrained that there is no way we would use biological or chemical weapons to save ourselves let alone consider woman and children legitmate targets.  The above would also mean that a China would not fear nuclear retaliation if they stepped in because we are the &#8220;good guys&#8221;.</p>
<p>I can prove my theory by the simple fact that anytime a black or hispanic academic calls for our death not a single politician cals for their removal from the tax-payer funded position.  We simple do not stand up for ourselves.  Our enemies, black, hispanic and Asian, laugh at us for defending them, importing them and not defending ourselves.  Barry Sotero&rsquo;s recent drive to get whites out of Federal employment has not been critizised by a single influential white in or out of government.  Can you imagine the uproar from a Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi or George Bush if a president decided to bring black federal employment DOWN to their percentage in the general population?  Oh, the outrage.</p>
<p>The black, hispanic, Asian and group that we dare not speak its name leadership are all laughing at us.  They destroyed us by having us destroy ourselves.  Can you imagine if the Japanese or Germans could have figured out a way in the 1930s to get us to do their dirty work for them?  They would have won the war.</p>
<p>We fought ourselves and now we have lost.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When they think about white majority, it&rsquo;ll be something in the history books&#8221;</p>
<p>When whites are no longer a majority &#8216;History&rsquo; won&rsquo;t be the same. History wont be defined the same way, but in a different way. Right now, each time when the word &#8216;History&rsquo; is used it would perhaps be better to substitute in it&rsquo;s place the word &#8216;Emotion&rsquo;. The word &#8216;emotion&rsquo; being a more accurate definition of the word being used and a more accurate label for what is really being discussed and the intended &#8216;feelings&rsquo; being conjured up? When whites become a minority, all this looking to the past will be something cast aside to the past. Looking at &#8216;history&rsquo; in the previous way will be considered hateful. </p>

I agree .<br>
Poster # 11  shouldn&rsquo;t shun other whites(who happen to be white-hispanic) because they speak Spanish and even claimed that they dont want to be white when over 52 percent self-identified as white. So white hispanic is about 8.7 percent of the US population ( I earlier wrote that they were about 6.4 percent but<br>
that was based on white hispanic being 40 percent of the hispanic population. However, I check wikipedia and they are<br>
53 percent of the Hispanic population).</p>
<p>And many of these white Americans, who happen to be hispanic, feel betray and let down by the likes of poster#11 because they live their lives as white in Latin America or  and are no less loyal to Europe and America as American whites.</p>

		<p>As been already stated, the defintion of &lsquo;white&rsquo; in the census is extremely broad. It often includes some Central Asian people and even Arabs(since Jews are often seen as White, the demographers felt that you need to add other semites for fairness too, despite the fact that most Ashkenazi Jews have at least 50 % european heritage and Arabs do not).</p>
<p>The real White infant population could easily be 40-42 % in reality.</p>
<p>As for the situation in America, this was already in the cards 20-30 years ago. Whites are now doomed in the sense of a strong majority. This will mean that racial consciousness will undoubtedly rise but to what avail? America will now never become a European country unless some kind of disaster sets in and I certainly do not wish to see that at all.</p>
<p>When the multiculturalists at times say that the world used to be multicultural in a sense, that was true. That&rsquo;s the reason why the nation-state was built: it was to prevent ethnic perpetual conflict.</p>
<p>Now we&rsquo;ve thrown away the last 150 years of progress. We can debate who/what groups are to blame. I certainly think that without the owners of the media - you know who they are - we wouldn&rsquo;t even get near this situation but some kind of deterioration was inevitable.</p>
<p>Beside, there was no real push back once these voices were raised in the 50s, 60s and so on. So we were weak culturally and spiritually even before the 60s.</p>
<p>People sometimes refer to the 50s when whites were normally sound and normal in their convictions. That is true, but whites were not *strong* in their convictions in any sense. It was just vague, which is why the diversity train got off to speed, because it faced no real resistance.</p>
<p>Where do we go from here? Well we won&rsquo;t see a South Africa, that&rsquo;s for sure. Europe will stay be quite, but not as much, monolithic. Same with Australia, Canada.</p>
<p>Western nations, due to their demographics, will most likely be severely weakened economically and culturally until there is a strong European voice. It is already happening in Europe.</p>
<p>In America, you&rsquo;ve paid for the corrupt two-party system which has essentially check-mated you. In Europe, it is much easier to gain influence because once you get to 5-10 %, you tend to have influence.</p>
<p>As for the future? Well, I think it is likely that we will see tremendous amount of conflict. It&rsquo;s certainly possible that we&rsquo;ll see through this, but the price will be heavy. Whites have controlled Africans and mestizos before (as well as Arabs and others), but the South African experiment shows that being a 10-15 % minority is doomed in the long run. You need a solid majority or at least a very large minority (something Euro-America will soon have in perhaps no more than 15 years when looking at total population) to make anything out of it.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll see anything unless there is some resource crisis whether it&rsquo;s climate change, peak oil or something similar.</p>
<p>But of course, if nanotechnology continues at it&rsquo;s pace, race could be largely nullified as all gaps could be filled by new, advanced technology instead. Anyone who keeps an eye on these developments know that we are much closer than people realize, 15-20 years at most. About the same time as Euro-America slips into minority status. So for me, we could actually end up seeing an increasingly strained slog the next 10 years or so, before the situation slowly starts to improve (or if you wish, become nullified) and then eventually become obsolete.</p>
<p>The other version is a resource scare. And then Europeans all over will be forced to come together, probably together with Asians and/or other friendly populations. If, heavens forbid, this would happen then America will be an extremely unpleasant place to be compared to much more homogenous Europe (especially the Northern parts).</p>

<p>I understand the distinction, and I assure you that I was railing against defeatism, not pessimism.  Though I must disagree when you say that we&rsquo;ll never be able to regain what we once had without major conflict.  That implies that reversing the demographic trends are impossible, at which point I feel inclined to point out that the several hundred thousand Amish are descended from approximately 200 men and women, and only took several centuries to reach their present numbers.  As well as current non-white population growth levels being able sustain themselves when whites are no longer growing massive amounts of food for them.</p>
<p>As far as not being at the top forever&hellip; well, that remains to be seen.</p>

		<p>RE: illegal immigration; this is strictly a political/economic decision. The question is WHY does the gov&rsquo;t encourage it? My neighbor has a landscape crew that comes by every 2 weeks. 6 weeks ago, they were short one and i asked the crew where their partner had gone. They told me he had gone to Mexico to see his dying mother and that had tried to dissuade him because he was illegal.  He had no worried about it.. He went and came back as he had pre-scheduled! The border was not a problem.  They come and go as they please.</p>
<p><br>
RE:  hispanic birthrates are not as big an issue. In Mexico, the large (6-12) children families are long gone, 2-4 is the current rate, and declining. US hispanics are slightly higher than the the 2.1  replacement rate. It seems high due to their size, BUT, since it is a smaller group than white, the REAL issue is the LOW birthrate for whites. In essence, whites are committed to committing suicide. IF white stopped contracepting, aborting, accepting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle and only having 1.1 kids, the the % of hispanics in the US would be be a moot point.  200MM white american having only 3-4 kids in the next generation would maintain their numbers superiority.  This is not a political problem, rather a spiritual problem.  Many would rather have 2 brand new cars and an idle life than have kids.  Unless whites are unwilling to sacrifice for their own country, what else would you expect?  </p>
<p>The large productive farm once willed with children, working the fields and enjoying its fruits has left its orchards unattended, the house almost empty, only 2 elderly folks left.  </p>

		<p>Looks like the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (Hart-Celler Act) is coming home to roost! Let me remind my fellow AR readers what Kennedy said, as he stood on the floor of the US Senate and uttered the following words in support of this bill:</p>
<p>&#8220;First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same&hellip;. Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset&hellip;. Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia&hellip;. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think&hellip;. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would appear that Kennedy was incredibly stupid (doesn&rsquo;t augur well for that Harvard education) or he intentionally mislead the American people regarding the devastating long-term consequences the Hart-Cellar Act would have on this country. </p>
<p>Either way, with so called &#8220;leaders&#8221; like Kennedy in power, who needs enemies!</p>

		<p>Covering illegal and medicaid births has made having children for the rest of us almost financially impossible. When my son was born three months ago we were left owing about 3000- and this was with insurance. When our daughter was born almost 4 years ago we didnt have insurance but didnt qualify for medicaid so we made a deal with the hospital to pay 1950.00 for the hospital stay and made payment arrangements with the doctor&rsquo;s office. We got a discount on my portion of the hospital bill since we paid it before leaving but we are still making partial payments on the rest. I would love to have at least one more child but unless we sell our house (it is on the market) I could not imagine being able to afford another baby! I live in Utah and it is not uncommon to meet white families with 7-8 children so at least here whites are not endangered. One reason parents can afford this is that the LDS church often helps tithe paying members with medical and other bills so that they can have kids. </p>

		<p>I only hope I live long enough to see the school busing, affirmative action, pro illegal immigration and aiding and abetting black on White crime Judges and attorneys 85 years old and stuck in the affirmative action nursing homes and medical system they have foisted on America.</p>
<p>Affirmative action Drs who can&rsquo;t diagnose a broken bone if it is sticking out of the limb, nurses with fake credentials hired by their aunt who is the administrator of the nursing home hope the judges and anti White attorneys enjoy the fruits of their labor.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t say Judges and attorneys are rich enough to afford private health care.  First they are not all that rich.  Second even the very absolutely top 10 hospitals in the country have hired nothing but incompetent diversity MDs, RNs, Nps, nurses aides, therapist, and technicians of all sorts for 35 years now.</p>
<p>We no longer have the critical mass of merit qualified compentent White American male Drs to turn back the tide of useless affirmative action health care providers. No matter how much you pay are where you go in many states most of the Drs are affirmative action fools.</p>
<p>The feminazis will be the worst shape of all because they totally refused to have children.  So they will not have middle aged children and young adult granchildren to care for them. They will be totally dependent on incompetent third worlders with dubious credentials who hate them because they are White.</p>
<p>Here is a quote from the Ford Foundation front man who was the official founder of Ford Foundation&rsquo;s MALDEF</p>
<p>&#8220;You old white people. It is your duty to die.Blog<br>
Aug 8, 2011 &hellip; You old white people. &hellip; Mario Obledo, California Coalition of Hispanic <br>
Organizations and California State Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare     texasfred.net/archives/11479 - </p>
<p>There is also a professor of Chicano studies at one of the Cal State universities I think he is named Navarro or Naverette who had said that old White people should be killed in their nursing homes.</p>
<p>Both black and hispanic organizations, some of them quite mainstream have pointed out that White women live the longest and therefore get the most out of social security, pensions, medicare and senior services.</p>
<p>Black men die the youngest because they kill each other.   Next Hispanic men.  The idea is that why should young black and hispanic men work and pay taxes into social security, pensions, medicare, medicaid and general funds that provide services for the elderly who are mostly White women after age 75.</p>
<p>It is not true that young blacks work.  They are either on welfare, in prison costing the taxpayers $25,000 per year, or affirmative action goverment workers doing nothing and living off the tax payer as much as a senior on social security and medicare.</p>
<p>Who will be at the mercy of their beloved non Whites?  Not me, I&rsquo;ll be safe at the homes of children or grandchildren.  The 85 year old childless feminazis will be in the nursing homes totally helpless.</p>

		<p>   Correct me if I am wrong here but it is my understanding that the only south of the border types that are largely descended from the Spanish are the Argentines, Bolivians and Chileans . This not to say that Spaniards will not be found in the other nations but that in these three nations they are the norm and the populations in the other Central and South American nations, including Mexico, are largely Amer-Indian .</p>

White cyclists attacked st louis knockout king.</p>
<p>I read the article on the STLoday.com website. The victims are the people who run trailnet.  It is one of these slobbering, sniveling liberal groups who are so deluded and grandiose that they think they will save the planet by riding bikes and ordering other people to ride bikes.</p>
<p>There were 163 comments Sat 8-27.  </p>
<p>Many were from people who said and it is all too true that the St Louis police and news outlets who refused the describe the &#8220;teens&#8221;. because the attackers were obviously black  are racist.  Whites in St Louis are sick and tired of being attacked by blacks and the race of the attackers being covered up by police, news and city hall.</p>
<p>Several home owners saw the attacks and called in 911 describing the attackers as black.</p>
<p>The bike riders who were attacked also commented.  Every one of them defended the black attackers.  Every one of them called the other commentators &#8220;racist&#8221; because the commentators pointed out that the police are racist for refusing to describe  black attackers as black.</p>
<p>Those comments by White liberals who were attacked only the night  before are an indication of White liberal thinking. One of the bikers even wrote that the householders who called 911 and described the attackers as black were racist.</p>
<p>Apparently Missouri is a CCW state.  Many commentators are also bike riders.  They are not grandiose liberals who think riding a bike will save the earth goddes Gia.  They wrote that they always carry guns when on their bike.  Many others wrote that they carry guns whenever they leave their homes for any reason because the St. Louis blacks are so danggerous and the police either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>The comments show how blind White liberals are.  White police officers have told me that when some White women are raped and the officer asks the race of the rapist some White women will accuse the officer of racism because he assumed the rapists were black.  They always were.  Of course White police officers are not being hired any more.</p>
<p>Read those comments at STLtoday ans see first hand how insane and warped and orwellian White liberals are.</p>

		<p>The hispanic race was created by the Ford Foundation in 1968. During the same year they created MALDEF and LARAZA as front groups behind which Ford Foundation pushed its anti White agenda.</p>
<p>The 1970 census shows no hispanic race.  The Judiciary and the Ford Foundation created the hispanic race between 1968 and 1975.</p>
<p>The hispanic race first appeared in the 1980 census.</p>
<p>The 1980 census showed a total population of 226,545,805,<br>
Whites 188 371 622 and newly created hispanics 14, 608,673</p>
<p>We can see therefore, that with the help of the multi billion dollar Ford Foundation, one of Kennedy&rsquo;s best and brightest appointees McGeorge Bundy, and unspeakable Judges 14 million people conquered 188 million people without a shot being fired. </p>
<p>Almost like Henry 8 getting rid of the 1,300 year old Catholic religion of England in about 5 years because he had the power.<br>
Unlike 16th century English, we Whites can&rsquo;t just convert to the official religion and keep our civil rights.  The DOJ has decreed several times that the 14th amendment does not apply to Whites.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and 1975 several court rulings by anti White White male judges decreed that (1) Hispanic was a separate race.<br>
(2) Hispanics were entitled to all the affirmative action priviliges that blacks were.  </p>
<p>I would have to have a password to get into the federal and several state court computers to find out the names of the lawsuits, Judges and and White attorneys in each case.  I&rsquo;m not going to the trouble. The damage was around the time I was born. Nothing I can do about it.  </p>
<p>They say knowledge and information are power.  Not so.<br>
Whites can know everthing possible about affirmative action and the anti White judiciary, goverment and billion dollar foundations but we can&rsquo;t do a thing about it.</p>
<p>Note that McGeorge Bundy, some hotshot in the Kennedy adminstration was head of the Ford Foundation at the time.</p>
<p>New Yorkers will remember that at the same time Bundy was creating the hispanic race, he was using black panthers, black muslim serial killers of Whites and dozens of black poverty pimp preachers to exclude Whites from teaching and working in New York City schools.  </p>
<p>Brownsville neighborhood schools are the most well known of these take overs by radical blacks directed and funded by the Ford Foundation, but it went on all over NYC.</p>
<p>McGeorge Bundy also funded and helped organize the Blackstone Rangers and several other decades old black organized crime gangs in Chicago. Their record was bad as the mafia, actually worse because the mafia seldom went out for snatching purses from 80 year old women to supplement extortion and other organized crime businesses.</p>
<p>Mayor Daley the first was very pro black because the blacks kept him in office for decades.  But even he fought against funding the Blackstone Rangers.  He told Bundy numerous times that the Blackstone Rangers and the other black gangs Bundy funded were not freedom fighters but common criminals. Bundy did it anyway and black crime exploded in Chicago.  </p>
<p>More and more Whites fled the violence.  Daley didn&rsquo;t care.  The black criminals, not the civilized non criminal Whites kept him in office.</p>
<p>Here is a short history of how a multi billion dollar do gooder foundation, established as a tax dodge by one of the wealthiest families in America went about creating the non existent hispanic race and destroying the White race.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an irony, given the increasing tension between black and Hispanic groups in Southern California, that Ford originally approached the question of Hispanic rights with the intention of strengthening its ongoing efforts on behalf of blacks. </p>
<p>According to the writings of Siobhan Oppenheimer-Nicolau, a former Ford program officer, officials at Ford determined in 1966 &#8220;that the problems of Blacks and other disadvantaged groups would not receive sustained attention unless the political base for the disadvantaged was broadened.&#8221; </p>
<p>Two years later Ford would create the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the most influential Hispanic group in the country  &mdash;  and Ford&rsquo;s largest Hispanic policy recipient.<br>
Who contributes to  the likes of MALDEF? </p>
<p>Modeled after the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, MALDEF, with an initial $2.2-million grant, was formed with the mandate &#8220;to assist Hispanics (legal or otherwise) in using legal means to secure their rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret noticed that:</p>
<p>the Ford Foundation did not allow hispanics to run MALDEF all by itself.  White Ford Foundation operatives supervised, monitored and ran MALDEF every step of the way.<br>
 <br>
_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&#8220;A second grant was made to establish the National Council of La Raza &#8220;to coordinate efforts to achieve civil rights and equal opportunity&#8221; through support of Community Development Corporations. </p>
<p>Under the guidance of newly installed McGeorge Bundy, the Ford Foundation, in addition to creating MALDEF and La Raza, funded numerous other Hispanic advocacy groups, such as the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project and the Latino Institute. In 1974, Ford would establish the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund to mimic MALDEF&rsquo;s efforts among Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>Over the next three decades Ford and other liberal institutions, such as the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, would seek to expand the rights of Hispanics in a variety of ways. One report by the Latino Institute found that in 1977-78, &#8220;the Ford Foundation, provided over half (54 percent) of the support for Hispanic needs and concerns. </p>
<p>The Ford grants were nine times greater in value than the foundation providing the next highest amount.&#8221; The survey also revealed that MALDEF alone received almost one-third of all funds given to Hispanic-controlled organizations. To date, Ford has given more than $18.9 million to MALDEF, and $12.9 million to the National Council of La Raza.&#8221;<br>

Along with noting the racial demographics of the next generation, we should also take note of their socioeconomic characteristics as well.</p>
<p>50 percent of California is hispanic.  They are low wage and welfare people.  More and more even lower hispanic indians are pouring over the border, 4ft10 toltecs, mixtecs ocahacans whatever they are.  They come from villages where there are not even elementary schools.  They speak no Spanish.</p>
<p>Every decade the mexican invasion gets lower and lower in IQ and jobs skills.</p>
<p>I looked at an small apartment house I might want to buy for my grandchildren.  They are all under 10, but it could be a good investment for them in 15 years.</p>
<p>I told the broker I am hesitant to buy in California because half the population is low income hispanics and it gets worse every decade.  Those no income no assets no down payment mortgages failed.  My concern is that soon there will not be enough upper middle income to buy real estate in 15 or 20 years when the grandkids might want to cash in.</p>
<p>The broker, who has an MBA and is with Coldwell Banker told me he and other real estate people have the same concern.</p>
<p>Something to think about.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should encourage our daughters to marry in their twenties and have more than two children beginning in their twenties. We have to bring this subject up with our children, even our teenagers. The young men have to learn to become young &ldquo;men&rdquo; as well, not overaged adolescents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good thoughts, but IMHO, one of the rasons that  young men are so &#8220;adolescent&#8221; in their 20s is largely because they are shunned at school and vilified in general.  Not only that, but they are often chemically altered by RX for things like hyperactivity and ADD if they show any signs of being natural boys.  I recommend every find &#8220;The War Against Boys&#8221; by Christina Sommers.  It details how public schools and psychiatrists have been stunting boys, especially white boys systematically for 20 years at least.  That and the alienating anti-white male atmosphere in school and society in general tends to force them into an ever beckoning virtual life of computer games and fantasy.  This is a very tragic and dangerous set of abuses that must be understood and curtailed, if only by informed parents who will refuse to dope their boys and home school rather than allow their spirits to be crushed by the public school system.</p>
<p>It going to require more than that old fashioned, &#8220;knock it off and grow up&#8221; attitude we so often see in the conservative culture.  It&rsquo;s going to take flipping on that vaunted high IQ we keep reading about here.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be doomed.  We can take it upon ourselves to have more children.  Families in the fifties often had five or six kids. We can do that again if we want.  The ecology movement lead people to limit their families to two children but that trend can be reversed if people catch on to what is going on with our race.</p>

		<p>To Poster #72, I have to disagree wth you here. It&rsquo;s one thing to get along foreigners abroad, but quite another when you&rsquo;re overwhelmed with them in your own land. When their rights crush ours. When they outvote us and they work tirelessly to supress and destroy our interests, welfare and culture. When they look at us as fair game from rape, murcder and violence. When we are the target or racially motivated violence and are not safe anywhere we go. I have no moral problem with employing violence to defend our racial, political and economic interests in the face of genocide or subjugation. I am a Slav whose ancestors resorted to brutal warfare to kill Muslims, Mongols, Nazis and Jews intent on murdering the Ukrainian people, and I feel white Americans will have no choice to do the same. Out own govenrment wants us dead and extinct, and they are in league with the dark invaders. At the very least, true white Europeans will have to resort to brutal violence to seize new homelands where they can live without Jews, Muslims or other hostiles boots on their necks.</p>

		<p>  Yes, there are white Hispanics, but their numbers are small compared to the overwealming numbers of mestisos and mixed race immigrants. Alas, I don&rsquo;t relish the thought of becoming a Third World Latin country. There are many good people in Latin America, but that doesn&rsquo;t make Latin America a desireable place for American whites. The extreme class differences, environmental destruction, endemic poverty, racial conflicts and rampid crime will become a reality for all Americans on the day when whites become the minority in this once great country.</p>

		<p>White men who marry and have children with asian women may save their children and grandchildren.  Unfortunately the kids will have White last names.  Unfortunately the kids usually look more White than asian.</p>
<p>But they can claim asian on college and job applications.  Worst comes to worst they can always adopt the asian Mother or Grandmother&rsquo;s last name.  The girls can fix up their eye make up and hair to look more asian.</p>
<p>I went to college with 2 brothers.  White American last names, very white  skin, blue gray round eyes and slightly wavy black hair.  It was a couple years before I learned their Mother was korean.  During summers they always worked for their Mom&rsquo;s relatives in their businesses.</p>
<p>After college, looking like typical Whites with Irish coloring and their White last names they couldn&rsquo;t find jobs.  So both sets of grandparents  grandparents put up some money and they bought into some of the korean businesses and are now successful.</p>
<p>One partly owns and works as a mechanic in a prosperous repair garage.  The other partly owns and manages a garmetn factory.</p>
<p>Their years in college were a total waste of time and money.  Their korean networks gave them good jobs.</p>
<p>I think young Whites should change their names to hispanic.  If you have kids change their names to hispanic before they start high school.  An ordinary White IQ of 110 and a hispanic last name means a free ride throught an ivy league college and dozens of job offers  starting second semester of junior year.</p>
<p>Both private businesses and goverment agencies and schools and colleges buy lists of non White college students from those marketing outfits.  March of junior year they start sending out letters to all the asian, pacific islander, hispanic, black adn other non Whites begging them to come to work.</p>
<p>Non white college students don&rsquo;t have to look for work.  Letters begging them to accept employment arrive in the mail along with the pre approved credit card applications and the rest of the junk mail.</p>
<p>There are probably no more than 100,000 Whites in this country prepared to do anything about the decline of Whites.  Don&rsquo;t look to other Whites to help you.  </p>
<p>The race realists are too few, too weak and don&rsquo;t have enough money.  The anti White Whites have literally thousands of billions of dollars and every  Judge in their country for their war against Whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be doomed. We can take it upon ourselves to have more children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope you have a couple billion to set up a trust fund in another country to support all those White children when their parents are totally banned from any kind of employment and welfare.</p>
<p>The major reason Whites don&rsquo;t have kids is that they can&rsquo;t afford to because of, first affirmative action next, the need to live in the most expensive neighborhoods with long expensive commutes to keep their kids safe from the brutality and horrors of going to schools with not just thuggish black children but vicious black principals and teachers.</p>

<p>When people ask me about religion I always say, affirmative action and black on white crime proves there is no God.</p>
<p>The christian churches bring in thousands of non Whites as refugees every year.  I can understand the Catholics bringing in those alleged Catholic hispanics.</p>
<p>The Dakotas and Minnesota are full of somalians and other african muslims the Lutherans bring in.  The Lutherans bring them in on totally fraudulent refugee claims.  The Lutherans sign them up for every kind of welfare possible.  The somalians wander around town for a few months.  Then they start raping and robbing.</p>
<p>They are of course entitled to free public defenders.  The Lutherans go to court as character witnesses and plead with judge and jury to aquit.  If the somalian is convicted the Lutherans bombard the parole board with pleas for early release.</p>
<p>The Lutherans provide all sorts of attorneys when the muslim felon appears at the deportation hearing.  The Lutherans go to all the deportation hearings pleading for the african muslim to remain in  the country.  </p>
<p>Female Lutherans appear at the criminal trial, the parole hearings and the deportation hearings to plead that rape is legal in african muslim society and therefore the african muslim rapist should be allowed to stay in this country on full welfare benefits of course.</p>
<p>I can understand the Catholics importing more Catholics.  But why are the Lutherans and other protestant churches importing muslims?</p>
<p>The Mormons are importing thousands of hispanics every year.  At least the Mormons try to convert the hispanic catholics to Mormonism.  I doubt it will work out.  The no alcohol rule<br>
doesn&rsquo;t go over with  hispanics, especially the caliber of hispanics the Mormons are importing.</p>

		<p>I work in the financial services of one of the largest private hospitals in the country.  The neighborhood is White.</p>
<p>ABout 85 percent of the babies born in this hospital are as we call them, mexicans on medicaid.</p>
<p>Medicaid reimburses the hospital $1,100 for a normal birth and $1,400 for a cesearan.  We charge non medicaid patients $15,000 for a normal childbirth and $2,800 for the 24 hour stay for Mother and baby.</p>
<p>The insurance companies should join the anti immigration movement.  Why should they pay for all the mexican medicaid babies?  Why should they pay all those medical expenses caused by the illegal alien drunk drivers?  </p>
<p>The hospital and car replacement bills are paid for by the insurance company of the victim because the illegal drunks have no insurance and unless there are plenty of witnesses and a police car near by they just disappear.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t the insurance companies go after the illegals who are costing them so much money?</p>
<p>FYI MADD and the rigorous drunk driving laws were not created by a group of women against drunk driving.  MADD was and is a front group of the insurance companies.</p>
<p>For decades insurance companies paid out death, hospital and car replacement claims.  Then in the 1970&rsquo;s modern medicine, especially trained medics in the ambulance service  was able to save lives.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the insurance companies many whose lives were saved were severely disabled and needed life long medical care.  If at home they needed home health care, maid service, therapists, wheel chairs and monthly or more Drs visits for the rest of their lives.  Nursing home bills for a few months or a year is one thing, but a lifetime in a nursing home costs millions.</p>
<p>Insurance companies operate by numbers.  They add in the fact that young people are the most likely to be involved in auto accidents. The insurance companies knew that as medicine improved they would soon have tens of thousands of 16 to 30 year olds needing life long expensive medical care due to auto accidents.</p>
<p>So they founded and funded MADD.  Police and medical people happily joined in as they were very aware of the problem.</p>
<p>Our big problem is money.  The insurance companies have money. As their costs rise and rise and rise fewer people will buy their insurance.  They will still be stuck with paying for the mexican medicaid babies.  The hospitals are going bankrupt because of the ridiculously small medicaid payments.  Medical people were thrilled when MADD came along.  </p>
<p>In a sane world the insurance companies and medical providers  would join the anti illegal alien movement.  But sanity long ago departed from America.</p>

<p><i>A professor of Chicano studies at one of the Cal State universities &hellip; said that old White people should be killed in their nursing homes.  Both black and hispanic organizations  have pointed out that White women live the longest and therefore get the most out of social security, pensions, medicare, and senior services.<br>
  <br>
Black and Hispanic men die the youngest because they kill each other.  Why should young black and hispanic men work and pay taxes into social security, pensions, medicare, medicaid and general funds that provide services for the elderly,  who are mostly White women after age 75?</i></p>
<p>______________________________</p>
<p>This is not just the future, this is now.   But as time goes on it will get much worse.</p>
<p>I see this where I live.  There are many elderly people in the neighborhood, all white, mostly (no, all) cared for by  colored nurses and attendents   &mdash;   largely West Indian. West Indians seem to specialize in this profession.   Of all these elderly, feeble  whites virtually ALL are women.  There are many such women, but it is extremely rare to see a very old white man   &mdash;   hardly ever.   An old white man is as rare as a white baby.</p>

		<p>For all you naive amremers who think that voting will help us fight our anti White goverment and judiciary here is the latest on Alabama&rsquo;s immigration law.</p>
<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP)   &mdash;   A federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of Alabama&rsquo;s new law cracking down on illegal immigration, ruling Monday that she needed more time to decide whether the law opposed by the Obama administration, church leaders and immigrant-rights groups is constitutional.</p>
<p>The brief order by U.S. District Judge Sharon L. Blackburn means the law - which opponents and supporters alike have called the toughest in the nation - won&rsquo;t take effect as scheduled on Thursday.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t have any hope that the judiciary will let it stand.<br>

 So whoever thinks that there will a race war between whites and non-whites in America are ignoring that whites are living among non-whites throughout the world peacefully.

There is a crucial and  fundamental difference between the USA and these countries. They do not have a powerful third element which serves as a catalyst, forever stirring up the blacks and browns against us,  telling them how oppressed they are and how much we whites owe them.   In those countries they do not control the government, schools, and media. Nor are they preaching black pride and white guilt. That third element makes all the difference. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Correct me if I am wrong here but it is my understanding that the only south of the border types that are largely descended from the Spanish are the Argentines, Bolivians and Chileans . This not to say that Spaniards will not be found in the other nations but that in these three nations they are the norm and the populations in the other Central and South American nations, including Mexico, are largely Amer-Indian &#8220;</p>
<p>You are wrong. I am currently in S.A. I have travelled here many times and could be considered expert.</p>
<p>White Percentage</p>
<p>Mexico- 10%<br>
Colombia 20%<br>
Boliva 5%<br>
Ecuador 10%<br>
Brazil 20%<br>
Uraquay 90%<br>
Argentina 85%<br>
Chile 65%<br>
Peru 10%<br>
Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala 5%<br>
Cost Rica 10%<br>
Panama 15%<br>
Venezuela 20%<br>
Paraquay 10%</p>
<p>This thing about Hispanics in the USA being 40% White is ridiculous. Whites of Latin America rarely come here unless forced like the Cuban elite. The later waves were Mestizos, Blacks, Mulattos for the mst part. In.the USA around 5% of Hispanics are White. Period.</p>

		<p>   Unfortunately you cannot legally establish neighborhoods just for whites . Unless something really changes in a big way . And you can bet your bottom dollar minority special interest groups are working overtime to undermine defacto segregation right now . George C.Wallace warned us in the sixties that this is where it would all be headed in a speech I saw on TV referring to one of the new civil rights laws at the time.&#8221;What this new bill means is that if your grandmother runs a boarding house and does not want to rent to someone for whatever reason, she can go to Federal prison for that descision .&#8221; George Wallace certainly wasn&rsquo;t perfect as a conservative but he was lightyears ahead of any politician, conservative or liberal, we have nowadays . And had it not been for Arthur Bremer, he was fixing to rattle the foundation of Washington D.C. in 1972 .In another speech right about then he said,&#8221;We shook the eyeteeth of the liberals in such and such state (maybe Wisconsin?) Lets make them fall out here in Maryland .&#8221;    </p>

Their thoughts are sporadic at best, and as in what poster 88 writes, they push a defeatist, anti-White line of thought.  In addition to this, one posted the anti-Western line that complains about our alcoholism, prostitution, etc.  It is the same line used by pro-Islamics when denouncing the West.  I don&rsquo;t recall the thread in which it was posted, but it was almost word for word the propaganda the Islamists put forward. I&rsquo;m glad to see someone else has noticed this as well.</p>

		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t that there are too few whites or too many blacks and Hispanics. It&rsquo;s that there are too few whites with the backbone to fight anti-white discrimination and call out the double standards that exist in our society. White South Africans were vastly outnumbered by violent African tribes but managed to create and preserve a democratic white republic in South Africa for many years. When they lost their backbone, they lost their country. The same is happening to us, but it&rsquo;s not too late to change direction. All we need is enough whites with backbone.</p>

<p>You are wrong on the percentage of whites in most of the countries you have listed.  For example, almost 50 percent of Brazilians are white and 30 of Colombians not 20 percent you have given both countries(wikipedia).  You wont accurately accesss the percentage of whites in the region by observation. Many Americans, for example, believe that minorities are the majority and would be shocked if they are told that blacks are only 12 percent of U.S. population.  </p>
<p>If we rely on our observation, then some  white Americans whose ancestors are from Southern Europe and elsewhere would be deemed as non-whites by many &#8216;white nationalists&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>All the changes that led to this crisis, from the New Deal and Great Society to the 1965 Immigration law were created and enacted by the Greatest Generation.  The Boomers were born and molded postwar by these folks.  The entitlement schemes used to bribe Whites into WWII service and appease Blacks were mere ponzis requiring ever more recruits (immigrants) to uphold and maintain.  This generation that &#8220;saved the world&#8221; sacrificed ours in the process, and they are getting off scot-free and with mindless plaudits from subsequent generations who know nothing but the stories they were carefully taught.</p>

		<p>   Appreciate the info 114 . I was pretty much on target with Chile and Argentina . Obviously I was wrong on Bolivia . I did not know Uruguay was so white . </p>
<p>  I knew Brazil was already an ethnic slumgullion stew much like the U.S. is becoming but I forgot to mention it . Albeit a fairly sucessful one .Their main battle tank is impressive . Even so I do not want to see the U.S. become another Brazil . I can think of a Brazillion reasons why .</p>
<p>   My point was that someone kept posting about how white our southern most non-U.S. neighbors are and in my home state I can&rsquo;t see it .Some do appear to be pure Spanish but most look like AmerIndians to me .</p>
<p>   I think the best we can hope for is to change some of the laws that are currently doing us in . We need to be able to segregate in order to survive as a people .That is a God given right .We need armies of lawyers who are loyal to their fellow whites instead of to their bank accounts . Anything short of peaceful secession could very well end in tragedy . Just ask the South .     </p>

<p>Also, I don&rsquo;t want ADL SPLC FBI etc to know who I am.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to email you, but here is a little something to get you started.  </p>
<p>The David Horowitz mentioned is about 85 years old.  He is a third generation Russian immigrant communist.  He was CPUSA liason with the 1970&rsquo;s Black Panthers for years.  He quit because the Panthers planned to kill him.  Now he works as an unregistered lobbyist for a foreign country.</p>
<p>He has an excellent anti communist site discover the networks.  I knew most of it, but for those not familiar with the communist takeover of just about everything in this country it is very enlightening.</p>
<p>Note the writers of this communist plan to take over the country was created by 2 professors at Columbia U NYC one of our Ivy League universities. They may not have actually written it.  It may have been written in Russia and delivered to them.  </p>
<p>The nation magazine is one of the first communist magazines in the country. Editor is Katrina Vanden Huevel, daughter of the CEO of one of the major stock brokers in this country, I forget which one.</p>
<p>Nation makes no money.  It is supported by tax exempt donations from the usual billionaries who fund all the anti White causes.  Nation has practically no circulation.  It is donated to all public, university and college libraries in the country.</p>

The Cloward-Piven Strategy, Saul Alinsky, and Their Influence on Obama</p>
<p>The Cloward-Piven Strategy was published in The Nation in 1966. The strategy was developed by Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, professors at Columbia University in NYC. Piven was married to Cloward. </p>
<p>They wrote an article titled &#8220;The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty,&#8221; advocating increased enrollment in social welfare programs in order to collapse that system and force reforms, leading to a guaranteed annual income. This political strategy has been referred to as the &#8220;Cloward-Piven strategy.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Cloward-Piven Strategy was inspired by the August 1965 riots in the black district of Watts in Los Angeles (which erupted after police had used batons to subdue a black man suspected of drunk driving). </p>
<p>In their 1966 article, &#8220;The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty,&#8221; Cloward and Piven charged that the ruling classes used welfare to weaken the poor; that by providing a social safety net, the rich doused the fires of rebellion.</p>
<p> Poor people can advance only when &#8220;the rest of society is afraid of them,&#8221; Cloward told The New York Times on September 27, 1970. Rather than placating the poor with government hand-outs, wrote Cloward and Piven, activists should work to sabotage and destroy the welfare system; the collapse of the welfare state would ignite a political and financial crisis that would rock the nation; poor people would rise in revolt; only then would &#8220;the rest of society&#8221; accept their demands. </p>
<p>The key to sparking this rebellion would be to expose the inadequacy of the welfare state. Cloward-Piven&rsquo;s early promoters cited radical organizer Saul Alinsky as their inspiration. &#8220;Make the enemy live up to their own book of rules,&#8221; Alinsky wrote in his 1972 book, &#8220;Rules for Radicals.&#8221; </p>
<p>When pressed to honor every word of every law and statute, every Judaeo-Christian moral tenet, and every implicit promise of the liberal social contract, human agencies inevitably fall short. The system&rsquo;s failure to &#8220;live up&#8221; to its rule book can then be used to discredit it altogether, and to replace the capitalist &#8220;rule book&#8221; with a socialist one. </p>
<p>From Kurt Nimmo at Infowars.com, we learn: It is a mistake to believe the Cloward-Piven Strategy is scheme cooked up by academic Marxists of &#8220;New Left.&#8221; In fact, &#8220;the destruction of capitalism in America is a meticulous plan on the part of the global elite to consolidate power and destroy all opposition.&#8221; It has nothing to do with liberating the proletariat, but rather subjecting them to &#8220;world-socialism, scientifically planned and directed&#8221; and devised to transform the planet into a high-tech prison gulag.&#8221; </p>
<p>Saul Alinsky and his Book </p>
<p>Saul Alinsky is probably the best-known &#8220;community organizer&#8221; in the country today. Even though he died in 1972, he is still remembered for his book, Rules For Radicals,&#8221; published in 1971. In it he wrote, &#8220;What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. &#8216;The Prince&rsquo; was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. &#8216;Rules for Radicals&rsquo; is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away.&#8221; </p>
<p>From Noam Cohen at The New York Times, we learn, &#8220;The disruption of the town hall meetings has many Alinsky trademarks: using spectacle to make up for lack of numbers; targeting an individual to make a large point; and trying to use ridicule to persuade the undecided.&#8221; </p>
<p>Here are some excerpts from &#8220;Rules for Radicals.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Any effective means is automatically judged by the opposition as being unethical: One of our greatest revolutionary heroes was Francis Marion of South Carolina, who became immortalized in American history as &#8220;the Swamp Fox.&#8221; Marion was a revolutionary guerrilla. British General Cornwallis and the regular British Army found their plans and operations harried and disorganized by Marion&rsquo;s guerrilla tactics. Cornwallis was very critical of Marion&rsquo;s tactics. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if they call you names: The job of the organizer is to maneuver and bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack him as a &#8220;dangerous enemy.&#8221; </p>
<p>The first step: The organizer dedicated to changing the life of a particular community must first rub raw the resentments of the people of the community; fan the latent hostilities of many of the people to the point of overt expression. </p>
<p>Being on TV can be empowering: A man, in a demonstration at City Hall, might find himself confronting the mayor and saying, &#8220;Mr. Mayor, we have had it up to here and we are not going to take it any more.&#8221; Television cameramen put their microphones in front of him and ask, &ldquo;What is your name, sir?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Find a single person to focus your energies on: It should be borne in mind that the target is always trying to shift responsibility to get out of being the target. There is a constant squirming and moving and strategy - purposeful, and malicious at times. </p>
<p>Do not ignore the lower-middle class: They are a fearful people, who feel threatened from all sides: the nightmare of pending retirement and old age with a Social Security decimated by inflation; the shadow of unemployment from a slumping economy, with blacks, already fearsome because the cultures conflict, threatening job competition; the high cost of long-term illness; and finally with mortgages outstanding, they dread the possibility of property devaluation from non-whites moving into the neighborhood. <br>
It should also be noted that Mr. Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer. </p>
<p>Influence on Obama </p>
<p>Alinsky is considered to be the founder of modern community organizing in America. Alinsky&rsquo;s teachings influenced Obama early in his career as a community organizer on the far South Side of Chicago. Obama worked for Gerald Kellman&rsquo;s Developing Communities Project where he learned and taught Alinsky&rsquo;s methods for community organizing. </p>
<p>By following this link, you will see a chart that puts Obama at the epicenter of an incestuous stew of American radical leftism. Not only are his connections significant, they practically define who he is. Taken together, they constitute a who&rsquo;s who of the American radical left, and guiding all is the Cloward-Piven strategy. </p>
<p>In Breaking the System, David Horowitz and Liz Blane explain how Obama is using the Cloward-Piven Strategy to continuously manufacture crises of which he can take advantage, and to advance his agenda. Obama&rsquo;s plan, &#8220;&hellip;is the product of a calculated strategy by the radical Left to subvert America&rsquo;s free-enterprise system and to turn the country&rsquo;s citizens into wards of an always-growing state whose ultimate objective is to engineer American lives. </p>
<p>Specifically, Obama&rsquo;s policies reflect the strategy developed by two leftist professors, Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven, in the mid-1960s to manufacture crises that will fracture our social and cultural institutions and pave the way for a socialist redistribution of wealth and control over every aspect of individual endeavor. </p>

<p>Phoenix-based Nuestros Reconquistos claims that there will be a war very similar to the Civil War fought in the next five years. &ldquo;La Raza and MEChA have already talked to Latinos and Phoenix and explained that Latinos need to arm themselves for war,&rdquo; says Nuestros Reconquistos President Manuel Longoria.</p>
<p>Cecilia Maldonado of Chicanos Unidos Arizona isn&rsquo;t hoping for any sort of war, but believes it may be unavoidable. &ldquo;For generations, our people have prepared us to take back the lands of the Southwest that were stolen from our Mexican ancestors. Because of the bad economy and many racist laws, Latinos will be forced to fight sooner than later,&rdquo; says Mrs. Maldonado.</p>
<p>Latino groups believe they have enough people in states such as California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to successfully wage a war on the United States.  Who&rsquo;s side will you be on?</p>

<p>That kind of demographic change doesn&rsquo;t bode well for real whites either. &#8220;</p>
<p>If I knew any real Whites as you call them who were not White hating racist liberals, I might talk to them about racial issues I might talk to them.  So I talk to the Persians and Russians who like amremers are race realists about blacks.</p>

		<p>#126 wrote &#8220;You obviously have never laid eyes on an Aremenian or Persian.&#8221; </p>
<p>I have, and not just on one. I have worked with and studied with such people. There are even a whole bunch of them living on the street I live on. I think the real problem here is that I (but not you) can compare them to the large pool of native white nordics that have lived here since the ice receded ~10K years ago. You are probably lacking enough contact with white people - I mean real white people, not people who claim they are white - and you are thus not accustomed to white mentality or white physical traits.</p>
<p>Persians, Armenians, Kurds, Syrians etc etc are not white, they are primarily turkic/ancient southern mediterranian in origin with admixture of everything from north east asian to black african. Some of them have more of this and less of that, but none of them are what we call white, even if they have some white admixture. Physically they are shorter, swarthier and have noticeably coarser facial features than white people. Mentally they are less intelligent, more emotionally driven, less capable of structured, rational thinking, far less individual in their behaviour etc etc. They are made to be clannish, religious fundamentalists by white standards. They are genetically programmed to behave very different socially and they place extreme effort and importance on being socially dominant. And judging by the half breeds I have met, these traits are dominant over white mental traits. In fact, there exists an ethnic group that call themselves &#8220;ashkenazis&#8221; that are a mixture between white european and turkic/southern mediterranians. These guys are very, very clannish, very ethnically self aware, very socially dominant and very religious. In this they are no different from non-mixed minor asians, despite their white admixture. They are interesting as a kind of real world example of what we might call the weakness of white genes.</p>
<p>Or to put it shortly - minor asians build 3rd world nations where nothing ever works and everybody spends the day discussing the nature of god or quarreling with their neighbours over stupid stuff. The white locals doesnt. These people obviously arent white. Whiteness is more than just skin color. If it was, everyone could be white with the help of skin bleaching cremes. Its also a bunch of genes that give rise to rare mental traits, of which some are rare even among whites and basically nonexistent among nonwhites. Its not a coincidence that the science and technology that forms the modern world was invented by whites. Racially mixing with non white Caucasians like Armenians or Persians or the &#8220;culturally conservative American&#8221; favorite north east Asians will practically trash any chance of your offspring exhibiting uniquely white mental traits. </p>

In fact, many people in the South want to secede because they are Whiter than the rest.However that is a tiny part of Brazil.Forget Wikepedia believe me 20% Whites sounds way high to me as it is.</p>

<p>The Brazilian government recently announced that whites in Brazil had been surpassed by non-whites. And I wrote that almost 50 percent of Brazilians are white.  Who are you to tell people who is white and who isn&rsquo;t? They say that they are white and they &#8216;look&rsquo; white. So they are white.</p>
<p> &hellip; &#8216;The USA is probably only 65 percent real White now&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I dont see how you help yourself making this statement. I dont dispute that. The generally tendency by those who dispute the census  is  to lower that percentage stating that the U.S white percentage is around 50 percent, and they are wrong.The white race is about 65 (according to the census too) percent of the U.S population. </p>
<p>Not because someone has a drop of non-white blood means he is not white. About 30 percent of Whites in America has African ancestry.</p>

		<p>Wonder what anti White organization created this group, ADL? AJC?SPLC? FBI? ATF? DOJ?</p>
<p>Is Lon Horiguichi standing by to repel the evil Whites?</p>
<p>What a joke. West Allis is in Wisconsin.  Former headquarters of Allis Chalmers maker of heavy duty industrial bulldozers and other equipment.  Employed hundreds of thousand who either made, sold or used the equipment. Moved overseas long ago.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The Journal Sentinel reports that the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group, is planning an afternoon rally at West Allis City Hall on Saturday, September 3. </p>
<p>The newspaper conveys that a local representative of the National Socialist Movement, who lives in New Berlin and would only identify herself as Harriet P,  hopes that 50-100 members and sympathizers of her group will be present at the rally and said all participants have been told not to bring guns or any other weapons  &mdash;  - </p>
<p>But  if push comes to shove, members will have no problem &ldquo;returning to the good old days of duking it it out. &#8220;</p>
<p>Any shoving will be done by one of the many provacatuers in the organization.  Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if an FBI sniper shot one of their own informants?<br>

But if you think those people I was referring to are Race realists, either I am wrong about what AR represents or you are. My contention is that those people are out there and not representing Christianity. Just because we have some things in common does not change my opinion (or the facts) one iota. I am not going back to 1500, either by Moslems or so-called Christians. I want to solve our problems (mine and yours) in a realistic and rational way.<br>

<p>You say,  &#8220;I thought this was a race realist site for White Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is, and maybe YOU are the one that is not a race realist?  Where is your opinions, a fact? Your opinion is that &#8220;those people&#8221; do not represent Christianity. No, they don&rsquo;t. Anyway not the PC mainstream Christianity that passes for Christianity today. If anything your mind is closed and you are just content to believe what you have for most of your life without questioning certain things. That is where most people are today.</p>

		<p>Re those &#8220;Northwest&#8221; groups:</p>
<p>An independent country consisting of what are now the states of OR, WA, ID, WY and MT would have really left-wing &#8220;national&#8221; politics, because of the heavy white leftist and minority population blocs in the Seattle-Eugene corridor.</p>
<p>Re that CI denomination   &mdash;   We&rsquo;re all entitled to our own opinions, but we&rsquo;re not entitled to our own facts.  CI, like the similar British religion called &#8220;BI,&#8221; (the &#8220;I&#8221; stands for something different), believes that white Americans or white Britons are nothing more than the reassembled twelve tribes of ancient &#8220;I,&#8221; therefore the US or UK is &#8220;God&rsquo;s chosen nation,&#8221; and the obvious implication is that &#8220;those who call themselves Jews,&#8221; and their ethnostate, are &#8220;diabolical fakers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The history used to justify that worldview is blatantly wrong.  </p>
<p>What I think is going on is that people in successful or powerful countries or empires all throughout history have wanted to cite some sort of deity or divine imprimatur to explain their country&rsquo;s successes.  Egypt had Amon-Re, Rome at Jupiter, Greece had Zeus, etc etc.  CI/BI is just another chapter in that series.</p>

<p>Maybe reading the Bible and discovering the &#8220;travels&#8221; of the Tribes and the descriptions throughout the Bible of such Tribes, then maybe you just might come to a different conclusion. Why do you believe one people over another?  Maybe your facts are not facts at all.</p>
<p> I have read many &#8220;facts&#8221; on the Bible by the MS churches and I have read about British Israel and CI&hellip;. I always KNEW something was wrong with the MS Christianity preaches today (interracial adoptions, miscegenation, social justice, we are all the same, etc. etc.) and none of it made any sense and was so disjointed that I knew something was really out of whack. This is why the White Christian churches are losing members. Most of what they preach is White guilt and ask for their money to help the 3rd world keep reproducing. You know that is not in the Bible.</p>
<p>I do not belong to any church and just do my own research, read the Bible, pray for God&rsquo;s truth and put the puzzle together (connect the dots) to where I know it all fits. The mainstream churches today do not fit in that puzzle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hitler considered&hellip;..&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why do certain posters here think that Hitler was some sort of god?<br>
 The man was a half-educated former down and out who slept rough in the streets of Vienna, a failed art student with no more than an elementary education.Furthermore, in the final analysis, all he did (apart from causing the slaughter of millions of Europeans of all nationalities and religions), was to ensure the long term extinction of the German people through his failure and most probably the eventual destruction of the entire white race as today&rsquo;s prominent &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo; is the backlash against his policies.<br>
 Only a second rate mind would ever use the phrase &#8216;Hitler considered&rsquo; in this context - someone entirely and totally ignorant of ethnology, anthropology, German history and in particular the run up to and causes of World War 2.<br>
  For example Hungary was a German ally, yet the Hungarian national myth fully says that there Magyars were originally an Asiatic people.</p>

<p>How do YOU or any of us know except what you have read by who knows who and for what reason or AGENDA they may have had? Eye witnesses who have an agenda or get a pay-off? Do you honestly believe that there was NO conspiracy involved? There are two sides to every war. I am not anti-Hitler, nor pro-Hitler because I don&rsquo;t have all the HONEST answers I need to make a legitimate determination. </p>
<p>Do you really trust the history channel, the &#8220;history&#8221; in our school books, etc., the propaganda that was rampant during and ESPECIALLY after the war. Most of all do you trust OUR media, government, college professors, and so-called &#8220;experts&#8221;? If you do, then don&rsquo;t scold someone else for not believing all your &#8220;facts&#8221;.</p>

#140: No wonder they are taller, you are tiny! Women as small as you are not common here.</p>
<p>I am not tiny.  I am the exact average height of American women.</p>
<p>The more I read your posts the less I don&rsquo;t believe you.  If you are Russian, you are very familiar with Armenians but not Persians. If you are Scandinavian your country is infested with Persian but not Armenian asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Other than their homelands which are adjacent, there is nowhere in the world that has substantial Persian and Armenian settlers than the United States.<br>

		<p>&#8220;If Hitler &amp; co had access to 20/20 hindsight, they would just have sat back and twiddled their thumbs, waiting for the inherent dysfunction in democratic liberalism and communism to manifest itself as social decay and collapse.&#8221;</p>
<p>I often visit my sister in Frankfurt. Town seems to be about 1/3 turks grabbing and groping every woman in sight and black Americn military ghetto boys and girls behaving exactly as they do in Harlem, Detroit etc.</p>

		<p>#152. Yes, precisely. American women, of which about half are non white and those are generally pretty small, vertically speaking of course. I don&rsquo;t have a single adult female relative that is as short as you. One acquaintance or two out of many. You may be average by *their* standards, which increasingly are Americas standards, but not by ours. </p>
<p>Furthermore, plenty of euro-derived american women are of mediterranian origins, and these are shorter on average than northern Euros. The noticeable exception here are the southern slavs, who really do not belong to the typical mediterranian strata, having invaded the area from the north about 1.5Kyears ago. </p>
<p>We do not have many armenian immigrants here, but enough of them to make a representative sample. Russians I have spoken with claim that they are cut from the same cloth as the arabs, iranians and other middle easterners who live here, and from my own observations I have to concur. Sure, they are christian, but they look like, behave like and are generally very much like their immediate neighbors. Genes trump religion, passport and economic class. </p>
<p>#153. Yes its indeed a shame that a philosophically, scientifically and technologically distinguished people like the Germans should suffer such indignities, but remember, it was forced on them by gunpoint. Had they won, all of Europe would be free from multiculturalism and other cultural marxism induced social decay. But now the bad guys won, so we will have to suffer the inevitable consequences in the form of another Europe-wide war when their nihilistic divide-and-conquer schemes crash and burn, which they will do. The question is how much will be lost this time.  </p>
