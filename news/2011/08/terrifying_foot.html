			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Bates, Daily Mail (London), August 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As he rode the bus late one afternoon, Lefenus Pickett suddenly realised he could not stand by any longer.</p>
<p>A mother was spanking her child for running in the aisles so the 37-year-old intervened and told her: &#8216;That&rsquo;s child abuse&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Soon he would regret trying to be the Good Samaritan.</p>
<p>The woman, Penny Chapman, 20, is said to have made a call on her cell phone and minutes later two thugs began firing at the bus with an assault rifle and a handgun.</p>
<p>In terrifying CCTV video from inside the vehicle, passengers dive for cover and run for the front before the driver hit the gas and sped off.</p>
<p>Chapman was arrested and is now facing trial along with three men prosecutors say helped her during the terrifying incident in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>He watched her young son run up and down the aisles then she spanked him. &#8216;I told her, that&rsquo;s child abuse, that&rsquo;s a little boy,&rsquo; Mr Pickett said, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>The CCTV footage then shows Chapman making a phone call. </p>
<p>When the bus stopped she got off the back doors and allegedly pointed out Mr Pickett and told a friend who had got on and said: &#8216;I want you to shoot that (racial slur)&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As they flee two other men standing on the sidewalk wearing white T-shirts then open fire  &mdash;  causing panic on the bus.</p>
<p>&#8216;At first I froze for a minute as I stood up,&rsquo; Mr Pickett told the court, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>&#8216;But when I saw them actually shooting, I was just trying to move toward the front of the bus&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the panic a mother grabbed her child and an 80-year-old woman dropped to the floor just moments before a bullet shattered the glass over her head.</p>
<p>The passengers all rushed for the front as driver Desmond Jones, an Army veteran, sped off and went straight to hospital.</p>
<p>The gunmen fired a total of 13 bullets and of those five went through the back door and several went through the side  &mdash;  but incredibly nobody was injured.</p>
<p>At the court hearing Mr Pickett recounted what happened to the judge as the CCTV was played on a big screen.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that after the incident, which happened last month, came to light a police officer who patrols the neighbourhood was able to identify all the suspects and confirm they knew each other.</p>
<p>Judge James DeLeon ordered the four defendants to stand trial but dismissed charges against two others.</p>
<p>He said Lawrence Rahyle, 18, and Keith Bellamy, 23 did appear in the bus CCTV but were just spectators.</p>

		<p>America must be on the lookout in Philadelphia and all cities harboring racist Marxists.</p>
<p>These land pirates will continue to surface and be imprisoned as America slowly returns to a constitutional government and Wall Street seizes to pillage the middle class.</p>
<p>The most violent blacks are in their teens and quick to shoot.</p>
<p>Beware of flash mobs, drive-by shootings, and mob attacks on buses, especially after school, and where high concentrations of blacks of varying economic strata merge with whites.</p>

		<p>The other story that is linked to below the video states this at the end:</p>
<p><i>Defense lawyers argued that since no one was hit, no assault took place, according to MyFoxPhilly.com.</i></p>
<p>While what I am about to say seems counter-intuitive because it&rsquo;s not part of common definition of this term.  But the very fact that nobody was hit or hurt actually *proves* assault.  Because in legal terms, assault is the *threat* of bodily harm, battery is the actual bodily harm.  When someone is shooting a gun in your direction, you are in reasonable fear of bodily harm.</p>

		<p>You might as well stick an uncovered hand in between two cats fighting as to get involved in this kind of a situation. Many years ago at my part time video store job, a black kid about 10 or 11 tried to shoplift a video game (this company put magnetic strips inside the video games and on the VCR tapes). Upon seeing this and with the assumption that we would call the police, momma asked dad (or the male with this family) for his belt. She beat the tar out of this kid. </p>
<p>Also in the store that evening was a local TV personality who came running over and screaming &#8220;child abuse&#8221;. Momma threatened to turn the belt on this woman. Since I was the only male on duty that night, the TV host came over to me and started glowering because I didn&rsquo;t get involved. My comment that really set this woman off was &#8220;I guess junior will think twice about shoplifting again.&#8221; She threatened never to come into the store again (as if I cared). </p>
<p>It was probably just for the best that they departed without obtaining their order. Momma left all of the videos on the counter as she dragged junior to the car. Granted there weren&rsquo;t cell phones and YouTube at that time. This was even before Rodney King. Even today, the police would be the last people I would involve. Not for the welfare of the child, but for the amount of tax dollars burned up by endless government agencies. </p>
<p>The nice thing about these kinds of videos is that they tend to trip up those &#8220;We are all just the same&#8221; messages that the MSM likes to promote. </p>

		<p>We could learn a lot from this Black mother in how she disciplined her son.  Whites don&rsquo;t give Black mothers enough credit for understanding how best to punish a Black male child  &mdash;  we simply watch in horror as they smack them mercilessly.</p>
<p>In dealing with Black males in general, we know one thing  &mdash;  they will respect only overwhelming force.  If they perceive any weakness in their opponent, they will take advantage of him.  </p>
<p>Black mothers know this about their own children, so why haven&rsquo;t our police forces figured it out yet?</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the worthwhile government jobs that Black women would be actually good at would be advising our police departments on how best to keep Black males in line.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind my tax dollars being spent of that  &mdash;  and I think we&rsquo;d see some immediate and positive changes in Black male behavior.</p>

<p>Wrong. The guy who complained, Lefenus Pickett, is black. Look at the original article. I can understand why the man was concerned, but there&rsquo;s no reasoning with a mad, black woman. They&rsquo;re more dangerous than North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear arsenal.</p>

		<p>The video shows the Mother barely tapping the boys rear end, and then only once.  &#8220;Child abuse&#8221; by spanking is more of a continued beating type of action. In this case, the punishment was not only warranted and appropriate, but seems to have worked quite well. The second problem though is indeed with the Mother, in that she couldn&rsquo;t take the simplest criticism or just ignore it. That she moves the situation from a simple complaint by a probably childless person to that of assault by gunfire shows a gross lack of common sense.  It doesn&rsquo;t make much sense either, in that the Mother seems competent enough to apply appropriate discipline, but then goes so far overboard in her response to the complaint.  I don&rsquo;t know, maybe the racial component pushed her to call for the fire support as compared to just a verbal retort.  In any case, the fact the the gunfire assailants were Black is not surprising.  That they unloaded on innocent bystanders is likewise unsurprising. We have imported Africa and encourage Africans to celebrate their &#8220;culture&#8221;; now we see in ever increasing incidents just what African culture brings to our once civilized society.</p>

		<p>One thing blacks know how to do better than anybody is get down and take cover when they heard the familiar sound of rat a tat tat bang bang &hellip; Quick reflexes save lives. <br>
Maybe thats why so many dumb whites get shot and have such slow reflexes. <br>
Maybe whites need to take classes on how to act quicker and how to take cover. This could save white lives.</p>
<p>Blame Rosa Parks for all this. With blacks in the back the bus driver could see them in his mirror. <br>

		<p>This is what happens when you even mildly criticise blacks (even if you&rsquo;re black yourself)  A totally, wildly out of proportion retaliation, ranging from foul mouthed, loud verbal abuse, to an incident like this.  A couple of incidents in the UK in the last few years, featured on the &#8220;Crimewatch&#8221; TV programme: on a train in London, a (White) man rebuked a loud, foul-mouthed black &#8220;woman&#8221;, who was doing what blacks do in public - befouling the air around her with curses, foul language and bad attitude.  She made a phone call, and a couple of stops down the line, a black man got on, and beat the White man senseless with a baseball bat studded with nails.  A few years ago, in my home town, a black female student was asked by her (White) male housemates if she taken a DVD player or some such trivial thing.  The woman went ballistic, threatening all sorts, but the two boys thought nothing of it.  In the early hours of the morning, their front door was kicked in by two black &#8220;yoots&#8221;, accompanied by the female housemate.  The &#8220;yoots&#8221; tied up the two White guys, beat them and threatened them with knives, death and rape. </p>

<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>Agreed. Anytime any Black parent disciplines their children - that should be noticed and quiet support and respect should be given.</p>
<p>Blacks tend to have explosive tempers that go off when they are disrespected, so always try to maintain an honorable adult to child manner. Think of most Blacks as children who need to be helped a bit and expect childish temper tantrums that translate in to their thug relatives shooting assault riffles in to buses.<br>

		<p>The problem with Blacks and corporal punishment, is that Black parents (I&rsquo;m being generous with the plurality) always seem to discipline their children for the wrong things.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve worked in the retail industry for quite a while and I&rsquo;ve seen Black kids run around wreaking havoc and their parents seem disinterested.  Yet, let them ask if they can have something and their Mother is quick to smack him in the head.</p>
<p>Maybe this Mother was right to spank her child in this instance, but based on her response after being chastised for doing so, it&rsquo;s doubtful she was correcting his behavior, but rather hitting him for some other reason not seen in the footage shown.</p>

		<p>What surprises me most was she was able to just make a phone call and have several companions drop whatever they were doing and come over and shoot a bus load of people.  Like being possibly charged with attempted murder is worth it?  And they had no idea what really happened, they only knew what she said. </p>

<p>The main problems I think with the way black parents use corporeal punishment is not only what you say, they use it only as a matter of their own convenience, but also they passionately use it, and I don&rsquo;t mean that in a good way.  </p>
<p>I would use corporeal punishment, but only after some semblance of what we would call due process.  The child has to understand that you did your due diligence to find out for sure whether he or she really did something wrong.  They have to understand that the spanking is punishment for some sort of transgression.</p>
<p>The way blacks tend to use it is counterproductive, because it sends the message that passionate violence for personal convenience is okay.  </p>
