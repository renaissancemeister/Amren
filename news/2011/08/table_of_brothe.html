<p>I have a dream that my children will one day live in a nation where shoddy automotive companies will not require bailouts but will compete in the marketplace.</p>
<p>I have a dream today. However, I still drive a foreign car. </p>

		<p>Any white person who shows up with a watermelon, a rack of ribs, a bucket of Kentucky Fried, or a jug of Kool-Aid is gonna be lynched.  The fact is, this isn&rsquo;t reality; never has been and never will be.  Go to any public restaurant anywhere in the country where blacks and whites go, and you&rsquo;ll find blacks sitting with blacks and whites sitting with whites.  THAT is the reality.  I&rsquo;m not saying that blacks should be treated more poorly than whites, but I AM saying that segregation of the races is a natural thing.  50 years of forced integration hasn&rsquo;t worked.</p>

		<p>Reply to Howard W. Campbell:</p>
<p>On the necessity of needing to use a foreign car.  Howard, I agree with you.  I once had a an American-made Chevy Malibu.  It was the worst lemon of car I ever had!  I would often get stranded far away from home because of it constantly breaking down.</p>
<p>I am a patriotic American.  But until our automobile industry can gets its act together, I will no choice, except to use a Japanese-made car.</p>
<p>At present, I have a 2003 Toyota.  The only problems I have ever had with it, are having to replace the battery every two years, and a flat tire once in a while. This is a great improvement over the Chevy Malibu lemon I used to have!</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t GM Obama Motors now? </p>
<p>Just think Chevrolet USED to be a White man&rsquo;s car, created and built by White men. . They used to show WHITE people driving their cars&hellip;.&#8221;see the USA in your Chevrolet&#8221;&hellip;now they are all GLOBAL corporate sell outs. Race and country mean NOTHING to them. Especially the White race. </p>
<p>I now drive a Toyota. Best car I ever owned. I don&rsquo;t hear the Japanese putting down Whitey every chance they get or pushing the multiracial hell upon us.</p>
<p>Forget that PC &#8220;brotherhood of man.&#8221; There is no such thing. I believe the Marxists and the delusional, brainwashed &#8220;Christians&#8221; came up with that mantra.</p>

		<p>A &#8220;Japanese&#8221; car built on an American assembly line is probably more American than an American car.  I think part of the reason why American cars have such a crummy reputation is that so many American assembly lines are in big cities and therefore hire a lot of blacks.  Someone who I knew and was familiar with the American auto industry partially agrees with me, but also thinks there are other reasons.  Notice the Japanese car makers strategically put most of their American assembly lines in rural parts of America far away from blacks.</p>

__________</p>
<p>This may be true. Actually it&rsquo;s a very interesting point. </p>
<p>My company Mercedes-Benz produces in Tuscaloosa-Alabama, in the deep south, with tons of blacks, and most probably working in the production, rather in offices. </p>
<p>You, Amren readers, ever owned a Mercedes (built in the USA)? Were/Are you satisfied with it?</p>

<p>Yes, you are right. Also many American automakers have shipped off our jobs to Mexico, etc. I know Mexico builds our auto parts. I imagine China, etc also do the same.</p>

		<p>The video is all fine and dandy. Now we need to sit around and sing Kum-By-Yah. How about using the money spent on that video for something else. Is Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Nissan, etc. singing praises to MLK? My guess is NO!</p>
<p>There are three Japanese owned auto assembly plants in Indiana. All three happen to be in really white areas. Subaru-Isuzu in Lafayette, IN is strategically placed 45 miles north of Indy and 85 miles south of Gary. My guess is that less than 10% of the population is black. Because of Purdue University, you will see more asian faces as you walk around. The other two are in areas where the white population is in excess of 95%.</p>
<p>Ford used to have a huge facility on the East Side of Indy and GM is about to close down a stamping plant that was opened in the 1930&rsquo;s and employed 9000 people in the 1960&rsquo;s. I used to hear an uncle talking about not buying cars built on Friday or Monday. I guess this would hold true with cars actually built in Detroit, Louisville, and a few other places. By chance is there an app for the Iphone that will allow you to put in a VIN and find general information about the car you are looking to buy? </p>

		<p>There is no American car company anymore.  Most autoworkers are black.  Except for Ford they are government/foreign owned.  For the last 27 years I have been a loyal Mercury owner.  Bought my last Mercury last summer to get one of the final Marquis.  I prefer a bigger car, which no American company builds.  If I have to buy a smaller car I guess I will go with an Toyota Avalon.  Just wish it had a bench seat interior.  One thing is for sure, GM, Ford and Chrysler don&rsquo;t want my business anymore.</p>

<p>I have never owned one, but I have heard that a lot of American Mercedes owners have been having a lot of unusual quality and build issues in the last decade or so.  Same with certain BMW SUVs, and the Nissan Titan pickup truck.</p>
