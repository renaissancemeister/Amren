<h1><a href="https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/Predictive-Policing-Project-Reduces-Crime-Santa-Cruz-Calif.html">Predictive Policing Project Reduces Crime in Santa Cruz, Calif.</a></h1>
 

<p>Sarah Rich, Government Technology, August 19, 2011</p>

<p>The Santa Cruz, Calif., Police Department implemented a six-month predictive policing pilot project, which began July 1, to help officers predict certain types of crime in the city before it happens.</p>
<p>Through the predictive model, officers will patrol areas that weren&rsquo;t previously receiving enough of a police presence with the goal of deterring crime.</p>
<p>The project uses an algorithm that is similar to what&rsquo;s used for predicting earthquake aftershocks. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a belief that certain crime types-in this case, burglaries and vehicle thefts-can be predicted in the same way,&#8221; said Zach Friend, the Santa Cruz Police Department&rsquo;s press information officer and principal management analyst.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For the six-month pilot, the Police Department pulls crime data every day from its record management system that tracks crime that&rsquo;s been reported in the city. The data is put into a spreadsheet and geo-coded and then run through Mohler&rsquo;s Web-based computer algorithm.</p>
<p>The result is 10 maps outlining Santa Cruz&rsquo;s crime hot spots, which are distributed to police officers, who then can patrol more efficiently based on that information.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the nearly two months of use, the pilot has garnered positive results. Since the pilot&rsquo;s deployment, the model has correctly predicted 40 percent of the crimes that it was aiming to predict, and the Santa Cruz Police Department has seen a reduction in the types of crime that it&rsquo;s been addressing.</p>
<p>In addition, the Police Department saw a 27 percent decrease in the number of reported burglaries in July compared with July 2010. Friend said the department won&rsquo;t know how successful the model is until it&rsquo;s been running for at least three months.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Santa Cruz&rsquo;s model also removes potential biases officers may have about a particular area they patrol, according to Friend. If an officer has patrolled a certain neighborhood for a few years and is aware of problematic homes with inhabitants that have a history of drug use or criminal activity, that officer may feel inclined to spend additional time going by those locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The model normalizes the information. It doesn&rsquo;t look at people, it simply looks at crime,&#8221; Friend said. &#8220;[The model] may reinforce that you should go back to the [problem] area, but maybe only twice that week as opposed to all four days that you work your shift.&#8221;</p>
