<h1>City to Pay $30 Million, Hire 111 Black Firefighters</h1>
					
					<p>Fran Spielman, Chicago Sun-Times, August 17, 2011</p>					
					
									
                
                	
	                	<p>Chicago will hire 111 bypassed black firefighters by March 2012 and pay at least $30 million in damages to some 6,000 others who will never get that chance, under a court order expected to be approved Wednesday by a federal judge.</p>
<p>Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously agreed that African-American candidates did not wait too long before filing a lawsuit that accused the city of discriminating against them for the way it handled a 1995 firefighter&rsquo;s entrance exam.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court affirmed that ruling in May and remanded the case back to the trial court to implement a hiring remedy the city had been stalling.</p>
<p>Now, both sides have agreed on that plan and how it should be implemented.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The court order, to be presented to U.S. District Judge Joan Gotschall on Wednesday, calls for the city begin by sending postcards to all 6,000 black bypassed black candidates.</p>
<p>Those who indicate they are still interested in becoming Chicago firefighters will be entered into a &#8220;jobs lottery&#8221; to identify 750 candidates who will take a physical abilities test in October and undergo background checks, drug tests and medical exams.</p>
<p>From that group, the city will select 111 candidates who will enter the fire academy for training by the end of March 2012.</p>
<p>Would-be firefighters who have moved on to other careers or choose to bypass the jobs lottery for other reasons will receive cash awards of at least $5,000 per person. Chicago taxpayers will also be on the hook for $10 million to $20 million in back pension contributions for those who get jobs. That means the total cost could approach $50 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>When results from the 1995 entrance exam were disappointing for minorities, the city established a cut-off score of 89 and hired randomly from the top 1,800 &#8220;well-qualified&#8221; candidates.</p>
<p>In 2005, a federal judge ruled that the city&rsquo;s decision had the effect of perpetuating the predominantly white status quo, since 78 percent of those &#8216;&#8221;well-qualified&#8221; candidates were white.</p>
