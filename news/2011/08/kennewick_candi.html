<h1>Kennewick Candidate Who Advocates Death Penalty for Illegal Immigrants Advances</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lornet Turnbull, Seattle Times, August 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Kennewick City Council candidate who advocates the death penalty for illegal immigrants as well as making Kennewick an English-language-only community won enough votes in Tuesday&rsquo;s primary to advance to the November general election.</p>
<p>Loren Nichols won 26 percent of 1,512 votes cast for a seat on the City Council, knocking off opponent William Miller, who had declined to discuss his position on any issues publicly until after the primary.</p>
<p>On Nov. 8, Nichols will face incumbent Steve Young, the city&rsquo;s current mayor, who won the support of 62 percent of voters.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As extreme as my position is, one in four voters agreed with me,&#8221; Nichols said. &#8220;It shows that people are truly fed up. You just have to live here to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nichols said he&rsquo;s not affiliated with any political party. He first shared his controversial views about executing illegal immigrants on a radio program last week.</p>
<p>In an area of the state known for its conservatism and a love-hate relationship with undocumented immigrants, the comments drew wide attention and a range of response, including an editorial in the Tri-City Herald denouncing Nichols&rsquo; remarks as having &#8220;the mentality of a bumper sticker&#8221; and urging voters to reject him.</p>
<p>Nichols repeated his remarks in an interview Wednesday, saying those crossing the border illegally  &mdash;  a misdemeanor offense  &mdash;  should be shot on sight.</p>
<p>As a member of the City Council, he would push to see that illegal immigrants are granted 30 days&rsquo; notice to leave the city, he said, and those who refuse should be subject to the death penalty.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s racist. That is a pretty extreme stance and punishment for illegals even for me, but I like it. He probably will have no chance of getting elected, especially if the MSM covers it and his opponent receives a ton of cash.</p>

		<p>Throughout history, many nations, seeking to preserve identity, sovereignty and security, have had similarly draconian positions.  I myself have (maybe somewhat tongue-in-cheek) advocated the same, even before 9/11. Based on what the Obummer administration came out with today (&#8220;selective&#8221; deportation of illegals), if something drastic isn&rsquo;t done, and soon, we face the almost certain Roman-like future of destruction by an unwanted, alien people voluntarily &#8220;welcomed&#8221; by elitist rulers, a la the Goths in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. </p>

****************<br>
This is SO true. It is why I cringe every time I see an AmRen comment saying something along the lines of, &#8220;Well at least the Mexicans are better than the blacks.&#8221; I live just 50 miles from Kennewick, and I can tell you, the Mexicans (actually all sorts of undocumented Hispanics) are overrunning us, taking resources from whites, leaving nothing for those of us who pay for everything and spitting in our faces as they do so. <br>
Even the main stream media revealed the census figures stood at 52% Hispanic in Benton-Franklin county. <br>
Advocating the death penalty is a little extreme, and no-one would take it that far, but it&rsquo;s certainly understandable.</p>

		<p>You needn&rsquo;t go any further than Mexico&rsquo;s &#8220;racist&#8221; border policy in protecting their own southern border.  Yes, it involves extra-judicial shootings, beatings and deportations.  Don&rsquo;t believe me  &mdash;  just ask the Guatemalans who try to sneak into Mexico  &mdash;  the ones that survive.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think you can sneak over the border into Russia and not risk getting shot without a &#8220;trial&#8221;?  I can tell you  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s the last border you&rsquo;d want to cross without complete legal documentation.  Cross the border there sometime by train or car  &mdash;  the guy checking out your passport is going to be armed  &mdash;  and the three guys behind him will have AK47s.  </p>
<p>Forget about regular Army troops stationed at the border  &mdash;  there are thousands of Americans who would volunteer to protect our southern border  &mdash;  they&rsquo;d supply their own weapons and ammunition.  It wouldn&rsquo;t cost the Federal government a penny.  After that, there would be no problem, Period.</p>

<p>Why, thank you, &#8220;Lornet Turnbull,&#8221; for telling me what to think of candidate Nichols.  I was afraid I&rsquo;d have to make up my own mind.</p>
<p>But uppity White man that I am, I&rsquo;ve stubbornly insisted upon thinking for myself, and I think I support Loren Nichols 100%.  Now if only there were more like him in my own state, I could endorse them at the ballot box.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can find all you need to know about Lornet Turnbull on these pages:</p>

		<p>How do we contribute to this guy&rsquo;s campaign?  I would be willing to compromise on the death penalty position.  Maybe just give illegals the same sentence and prison conditions their home country gives illegals who invade their country, and I would send the bill for thier imprisonment to their country of origin.  Who says we conservatives aren&rsquo;t willing to compromise?</p>

<p>Is the reporter equating summary execution with marking English as the official language? Kind of seems like it.</p>

		<p>I think this is quite a good idea!  Internment camps for the illegals, an administrative hearing and a quick execution.  Certainly would have ended most illegal immigration.  If this had been started 60 years we wouldn&rsquo;t have the problem we have today.  Of course the illegals in our cities would riot but that would give the police an excuse to use deadly force, thus saving us additonal hearings.  Soon self-deportation would become very popular when they realized we were not backing down.</p>
<p>Ah, to dream.</p>

		<p>1 in 4 voters is a good start after 50 years of Black &amp; Latino Power because it is already waaay past the required 1/10 ratio needed for a minority point of view to eventually become the majority, proving that the govt-orchestrated Breivik fiasco hasn&rsquo;t intimidated Whites in America.</p>

		<p>With enough calls for the death penalty for illegals, maybe liberals would support deportation as a mercy.</p>
<p>During Soviet days, East Germany shot their citizens who tried to get out. This fellow is just talking about shooting non-citizens who are trying to get in.</p>

		<p>I think the death penalty is too far. Maybe for repeat offenders, and even then only if they commit a crime in our country or something.</p>
<p>But, I am delighted to read this article because, if 1/4 of Kennwick&rsquo;s population can support execution for illegals, it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to get the majority of voters to eventually support deporting illegals and down-scaling legal immigration.</p>

		<p>Illegal immigration is already a misdemeanor subject to (if I recall correctly) a 6 month prison sentence.  I would be satisfied if the existing law was simply enforced.  There&rsquo;s not a chance of that with Obama as prez or his likely successor, Perry. </p>

		<p>Tough times call for extreme measures.</p>
<p>I wonder if Loren Nichols has made it on to a Justice Department or Department of Homeland security watch list yet?</p>
<p>Just think if there were people in every state who would take this stand these immigrants would probably be tripping all over themselves trying to get back across the border. When they finally realize that Gringos aren&rsquo;t such pushovers after all.</p>

		<p>This kind of talk will alienate sensible voters who just want to see the current laws enforced. Stacking up harsher penalties on criminals that aren&rsquo;t even being pursued only gives our enemies fodder to call us NAZIs, and all the other garbage.</p>
<p>Calling for their heads makes us look bad. Illegals are here because a powerful sector of our own country rolls out the red carpet for them. Executing the illegals for taking up the offer is hypocritical. Call for the ouster of the traitors among US, but for crying out loud don&rsquo;t talk about killing people, especially after Brevik.</p>

		<p>This is not extreme at all. These people aren&rsquo;t undocumented workers, or illegal aliens, they are invaders. And they most certainly will use violence against Whites when the time has come. Whites have been brainwashed to believe that Multiculturalism and Racial Diversity, which are man made constructs, will work. But they won&rsquo;t; they lead to war. </p>

<p>They call us &#8220;Nazis&#8221; now for simply demanding our immigration laws be enforced, so what&rsquo;s the difference? I could care less what platitudes illegal invaders and their supporters use against us. Nazis executed innocent people who were lawful citizens of Germany.  Illegal invaders are anything but lawful in any sense of the meaning. But these distinctions mean nothing and will never be recongized by illegal invaders and their advocates. So why bother!</p>
