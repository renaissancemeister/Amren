<h1>Social Degeneration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Sowell, Human Events, August 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Someone at long last has had the courage to tell the plain, honest truth about race.</p>
<p>After mobs of young blacks rampaged through Philadelphia committing violence  &mdash;  as similar mobs have rampaged through Chicago, Denver, Milwaukee and other places  &mdash;  Philadelphia&rsquo;s black mayor, Michael A. Nutter, ordered a police crackdown and lashed out at the whole lifestyle of those who did such things.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While this might seem like it is just plain common sense, what Mayor Nutter said undermines a whole vision of the world that has brought fame, fortune and power to race hustlers in politics, the media and academia. Any racial disparities in hiring can only be due to racism and discrimination, according to the prevailing vision, which reaches from street corner demagogues to the august chambers of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p>Just to identify the rioters and looters as black is a radical departure, when mayors, police chiefs and the media in other cities report on these outbreaks of violence without mentioning the race of those who are doing these things. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The prevailing social dogma is that disparities in outcomes between races can only be due to disparities in how these races are treated. In other words, there cannot possibly be any differences in behavior.</p>
<p>But if black and white Americans had exactly the same behavior patterns, they would be the only two groups on this planet that are the same.</p>
<p>The Chinese minority in Malaysia has long been more successful and more prosperous than the Malay majority, just as the Indians in Fiji have long been more successful and more prosperous than the indigenous Fijians. At various places and times throughout history, the same could be said of the Armenians in Turkey, the Lebanese in Sierra Leone, the Parsees in India, the Japanese in Brazil, and numerous others.</p>
<p>There are similar disparities within particular racial or ethnic groups. {snip}</p>
<p>In the United States, despite the higher poverty level among blacks than among whites, the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits since 1994. The disparities within the black community are huge, both in behavior and in outcomes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the dogma persists that differences between groups can only be due to the way others treat them or to differences in the way others perceive them in &#8220;stereotypes.&#8221;</p>
<p>All around the country, people in politics and the media have been tip-toeing around the fact that violent attacks by blacks on whites in public places are racially motivated, even when the attackers themselves use anti-white invective and mock the victims they leave lying on the streets bleeding.</p>
<p>This is not something to ignore or excuse. It is something to be stopped. Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia seems to be the first to openly recognize this.</p>

<p>Blacks in Africa knew nothing of Christian marriage when they were at home.  They were brought here and given our culture. Those who embraced it prospered.  </p>
<p>Shame on us.  Blacks can&rsquo;t prosper without other Whites suffering.  </p>
<p>Any black you see here who has overcome his tribal and animist customs of Africa, only became civilized because Whites sacrificed their posterity and futures so Africans could act a little less African.</p>
<p>Blacks who speak English should never be allowed to speak to any member of the White Community unless prefacing all comments with &#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>They owe us an unpayable debt of gratitude, but they could start by forcing the NAACP to teach them how to not act so African unless they are willing to go back to Africa asap!<br>

<p>Will these incidence be in history books? Not if the &#8216;smart&rsquo; people have their way. Although, going by this same history, these events just may be in the books but twisted and somehow be made to show another example of white aggression and oppressive tactics. </p>

		<p>These mob attacks are the result of decades of liberal academics, politicians, and media people telling blacks that all their problems are caused by evil white people, when it is self evident that 99% of the problems of a ghetto black person are caused by himself or by other black people.  The leftists are spreading hatred, and that has consequences.  But the $PLC will never charge any of them with being haters; indeed, the $PLC is one of the biggest haters.</p>
<p>Thomas Sowell, who has come out strongly against affirmative action, is one of the few blacks I&rsquo;d vote for if he ever ran for office.  He&rsquo;d be vastly better than my current white representative or two white senators.</p>

		<p>Poster #3 is so right.  I&rsquo;ve worked in public schools for years now.  Young, white and/or jewish teachers, especially in english and social studies classes, do nothing but indoctrinate the students to blame whites for all their problems while inculcating a perpetual victim mentality.  It is so much brainwashing that it sickens me to see.</p>

		<p>I laugh at the arguments that it&rsquo;s a cultural thing.  If it was a cultural thing, then surely one population of blacks, somewhere on the planet, would be composed of intelligent high-achievers.</p>
<p>The fact that every black country is a pool (by our standards - I&rsquo;m sure some black countries are much nicer than other black countries), shows that it has less to do with culture than it has to do with genetics.</p>
<p>You show me a black majority area and I&rsquo;ll show you a place where no white man in his right mind would live.</p>

		<p>does avybody believe nutters comments on black fashion education etc will be respected or listened to by one black youth in philly??they dont care about any curfew or the police because 4 cars or ten officers cant control a mob of 500 or 1000 blacks and they know it they will do whatever they want including assault looting and eventually murder</p>

		<p>I like Sowell.  But the mayor was wrong in a sense.  Why is it always about what is good for blacks.  He you have blacks victimizing whites and the response by the mayor is &#8220;you hurt the black race&#8221;   How about they hurt the white race?</p>

		<p>Thomas Sowell is one of the very few guys who looks at affirmative action on a global scale. It isn&rsquo;t just anti-white. It&rsquo;s anti-merit against the best peoples everywhere. Communism.</p>

		<p>For your safety remember this, most police cars in the country read, &#8220;to serve and to protect&#8221;, well, why do they just watch and observe such violence?</p>
<p>Remember King riots, remember Katrina?  they watch then come clean up after the damage is done, the punks have run out of steam, and usually the NG has arrive.</p>

<p>So true&hellip; Maybe Sowell can start by reporting on ALL the black on White crimes such as those who murder our White police officers. Officer made a big mistake. Going into any black MC Donalds and buying a black kid something to eat was his last act of &#8220;kindness&rsquo;&hellip;</p>

		<p>I cannot understand why the Daily News crowd railed about this site. American Renaissance is not racist or racialistic;  It is not a hate site of white supremacy.  It has published articles from people who are not caucasian, from both ends of the political spectrum.<br>
Thomas Sowell is up there in the Pantheon of Clear Honest Thinking, along with Pat Buchanan.  My point of the day:  We are living in nihilistic times.  The era of the destruction of all moral values.  The demographics are changing, to the point of critical mass, the point of no return, and revolution of thinking and behavior will follow  &mdash;  -but not to anyone&rsquo;s advantage.  This nihilism has a life-cycle, and I wish SOMEBODY would explain it.<br>
We are living in an era not only of Social Darwinism, but of Gresham&rsquo;s Law.  There is some force of the whole liberal philosophy that drives out the good  &mdash;  -and the Establishment knows it and enforces it.  Sowell looked at how the mob in the street did it;  Now we need to know how the Establishment does it.  I wish someone of Sowell&rsquo;s  &mdash;  -or Buchanan&rsquo;s  &mdash;  -stature would explain the sociology, the &#8220;mechanics&#8221; of it.</p>
