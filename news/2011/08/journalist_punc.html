			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), August 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Canadian journalist was &#8216;punched in the face&rsquo; by a Muslim woman after accidentally taking her picture in a public square.</p>
<p>Writing in his column, David Menzies said he was with his nine year old son in Toronto&rsquo;s Yonge-Dundas Square testing out a new digital camera when a woman in a hijab approached him shouting that he could not take a picture of her.</p>
<p>The popular car columnist then says he was punched in the head by the woman and surrounded by a group of people shouting Arabic at him. A police officer then refused to press charges.</p>
<p>Relaying the incident in the <em>Toronto Sun</em>, Mr Menzies said: &#8216;Suddenly, a woman wearing a hijab ran toward me. </p>
<p>&#8216;She was part of a group that included two women wearing full face-covering burkas. She was screaming: &#8216;We are Muslim! You do not take pictures of us!&rsquo; (Odd. I can&rsquo;t find the &#8220;no photos&#8221; rule in the Qur&rsquo;an.)</p>
<p>&#8216;I informed the lady I was in a public square in a democracy. I can actually take pictures of whomever I please.</p>
<p>&#8216;And then: Ka-pow! Her fist collided with my face. Worse, she almost knocked my new camera from my hands.</p>
<p>&#8216;My son and I were then surrounded by a mob of about 20 people, many of whom were speaking Arabic. </p>
<p>&#8216;One kept demanding I surrender my camera to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Spotting a group of police officers, Mr Menzies ran over to tell them what had happened.</p>
<p>But despite having Arabic speaking witnesses, the officer said he would not press charges.</p>
<p>Mr menzies continued: &#8216;The officer interrogated the woman.</p>
<p>&#8216;She was still hysterical. Good. The constable would encounter first-hand what I had been forced to deal with earlier.</p>
<p>&#8216;The cop walked back to me. No charges would be laid, he said, because he believed the woman&rsquo;s story  &mdash;  namely, she was merely trying to knock the camera out of my hands.&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Why should the cops stick their necks out?  Just look at the officers in New Orleans who held back chaos and anarchy by shooting the rioters there during Katrina.  They we&rsquo;re rewarded with felony convictions.  Thanks to our Marxist overloards many people in the West are afraid to defend themselves.  The Nazis used the same tactic against the Jews and look what happened to them.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8216;You do not take pictures of us!&rsquo; (Odd. I can&rsquo;t find the &ldquo;no photos&rdquo; rule in the Qur&rsquo;an.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Two things at work here:</p>
<p>1. Creating an image of a person is considered idolatry within Islam. Even a simple photo is an image and that constitutes idolatry.</p>
<p>2. These are persons also believing in sorcery. The belief is that when you take a picture of a person, you are STEALING A PART OF THEIR VERY ESSENCE! It is as if you took a lock of their hair or fingernail clippings to use during a sorcery ritual to place a curse on the person.</p>
<p> &#8220;she was merely trying to knock the camera out of my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if knocking something out of the hands of another is not a crime. And even &#8220;merely&#8221; if &#8220;just&#8221; trying she struck the man, she did strike him. This cop was probably scared stiff and did not want to create an incident, he might have been mobbed.</p>
<p>And this attack too was directed against the son as well, a minor being attacked by adults, being surrounded and swarmed and threatened, physical force was used, that is an egregious offense.</p>
<p>This cop is outta his mind. There needs to be a civil suit here and big time.</p>

		<p>I really don&rsquo;t understand why things like this stop right there. Go over his head and talk to his superiors. Failing this, document everything and get a lawyer and sue the officer and the department. You know minorities do it all the time, why can&rsquo;t we? Eventually with pressure from white people, and white males especially, changes will happen. That incident could just have easily gotten out of control and they could have injured or even killed the picture taker.</p>
<p>People have to understand that Muslims promote marrying cousins within their families. Overtime this has created a high level of people in Arab and other Muslim nations of the mentally retarted. These people can&rsquo;t function properly half the time in a civilized nation and require brutal measures to be used against them to keep them in line. What was the last report about how high many in Arab nations are married to cousins? It was between 50-70% or somesuch. Now that explains a lot of their ignorance and stupitity. I think you&rsquo;ll find their impulse control and level of intelligence worse than Blacks if you don&rsquo;t cherry pick the ones still making it by in life by themselves.</p>

		<p>Muslims are very protective of any photograph of them. I think it is partially because of what the other poster stated- they are afraid of someone harming them remotely. It is not in the Quran so much as in the numerous Hadith which are mumblings and ravings of a crazy man. If someone looks at someone (especially a child) without uttering the prescribed prayers, many travelers to the middle east have been attacked by locals for breaking this taboo. My former husband was horrified when he found out I had posted a picture of him on a display at work with everyone else&rsquo;s family members. He demanded that I return the picture to him and I agreed. Unfortunately the photo was lost before I got it home. When he did not get it back he began to rant and rave that I had done some sort of magic ritual to hurt him in some way. I tried to explain that we didn&rsquo;t do that her in the civilized world to no avail. I also met college educated American women who had been bamboozled into this way of thinking. Sad really.</p>

		<p>There must be some mistake here?</p>
<p>It says she hit someone but then it said she was a Muslim.</p>
<p>Now everyone knows that is the religion of Peace and Love don&rsquo;t they?</p>

		<p>Police didn&rsquo;t do anything because they knew it would have provoked a riot. Cops are like you or me. Do you think they want to fist fight their way through a sea of crazy bearded arabs just to arrest some crazy muslim woman or just go home and watch television?</p>

		<p>After the Mohammad cartoon fiasco, websites started popping up featuring cartoons of Mohammad. May I suggest setting up a web page that features photos of unsuspecting Muslims.  The photographer in question was attacked because he did not know what to expect.  Future photographers, such as yours truly, will know to take their photos stealthily.  By the time the photos show up online, there will be nothing the Muslims can do about it.  We could even taunt them by writing that we are using the photos to do all sorts of horrible things to them.</p>

		<p>This may just be part of the bias against men that is present in our Western societies- I would expect that in Canada, as it is even more lost down the PC well than the US, that it is even worse.</p>
<p>An example- back when I was in college, my roommate and his girlfriend were having an argument in a mall. She had a &#8216;hysterical&rsquo; personality, and as their argument progressed, she suddenly flew into a fit, smacking and scratching at him and yelling. He was a fairly laid back guy generally, but by this point in their relationship, had been getting pretty tired of one thing after another like this out of her, and this time pushed her away from him, when she started physically attacking him. Got that? She attacked him, he pushes her away from him to prevent being scratched and hit more. </p>
<p>Three guesses as to which one the mall cops forcibly grabbed and hauled off.</p>

		<p>Bet this is a black muslim convert! I have been all over the muddled east and have never, NEVER heard any objection from any muslim (real muslims) to include the Bedouin of Iraq and Kuwait, the Saudis nor the Kuwaitis themselves&hellip;In fact, if you take a picture of the Bedouins they will clown for the camera.</p>

		<p>In Toronto, whenever someone attempts to press charge against muslims or blacks, the first thing the authorities do is to try everything they can to come up with reasons that they cannot do anything.  Blacks and muslim immigrants basically get away with everything they do.  </p>

<p>Is this America&rsquo;s future too? Are we afraid of upsetting the Religion of peace too? With the Fraud-in-charge in the Whitehouse and his thuggish DOJ, I say yes we are.</p>
