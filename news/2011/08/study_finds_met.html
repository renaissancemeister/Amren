<p>Minority students in a high-poverty neighborhood are more likely to pass through a metal detector on the way to class than their better-off and white peers are, even if the schools are equally safe, according to new research.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Delaware and the University of California, Irvine, based their findings on a study of nationally representative school data. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Yet, even after accounting for the levels of crime on schools&rsquo; campuses and in the surrounding neighborhoods, the researchers found that high-poverty schools were disproportionately likely to use such security mechanisms, and that the racial makeup of the student enrollment was a powerful predictor of whether the school would use metal detectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not that the more violent schools get metal detectors, or even the urban schools get metal detectors-though that&rsquo;s true,&#8221; said co-author Aaron Kupchik, an associate professor in sociology and criminal justice at the University of Delaware. &#8220;It&rsquo;s that schools with more students of color are more likely to get metal detectors, at every level, even elementary levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even after controlling for student behavior, neighborhood crime, and other safety indicators, researchers found that schools with higher concentrations of poor students were more likely than their better-off counterparts to have a full-time security or policy officer, drug-sniffing dogs, locked gates in elementary schools, and metal detectors in middle school.</p>
<p>The percentage of minority students in a school strongly predicted whether it would use metal detectors at all grade levels.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Daniel A. Domenech, the executive director of the Arlington, Va.-based American Association of School Administrators, said that administrators don&rsquo;t take student demographics into account when designing their security plans; they usually respond to specific violent incidents and national trends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is going to say we have a school and they&rsquo;re all minorities and they&rsquo;re poor, so we need to put more security on that building,&#8221; Mr. Domenech said.</p>
