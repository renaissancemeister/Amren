			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Muslim teenagers have admitted drawing burkas on advertisements of scantily-clad women because they offended their religious views.</p>
<p>In one incident, Mohammed Hasnath and Muhammed Tahir, both 18, used  black paint to draw the traditional  headdress over a model in a poster for Lynx deodorant.</p>
<p>The vandals said it was a &#8216;sin&rsquo; for the woman to remain uncovered and they were &#8216;just trying to do good&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They also painted over faces in several other advertisements, including one for the Nicolas Cage film Drive Angry.</p>
<p>Thames Magistrates&rsquo; Court in Bow, East London, was told the pair were caught red-handed after members of the public called police.</p>
<p>They had been seen painting over a female angel in the advertisement for Lynx at a bus shelter in February. Paint was also applied to the other side of the hoarding, which carried the poster for Drive Angry.</p>
<p>When police arrived the teenagers gave &#8216;full and frank admissions&rsquo;, said Taiwo Akinrowo, prosecuting. He said: &#8216;They told them that the way the women had been photographed was against their religion and they said it was a sin in Islam for a male to look twice at a woman who is not covered.</p>
<p>&#8216;Both have admitted painting over them. At first, they did not think it was a bad thing to do but they accept that it was not legal because it was not their property.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youths admitted six counts of criminal damage.</p>
<p>Hasnath said: &#8216;If someone was to look at our wife or mother or daughter with a bad intention we would not like it, so we were just trying to do good.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Hasnath, of Poplar, and Tahir, of Tower Hamlets, were each told to pay costs of £283 and were released on a 12-month conditional discharge.</p>
<p>The case came only days after Islamic extremists started a poster campaign proclaiming areas where Sharia law &#8216;enforcement zones&rsquo; have been set up. </p>
<p>The messages order that there should be &#8216;no gambling&rsquo;, &#8216;no music or concerts&rsquo;, &#8216;no porn or prostitution&rsquo;, &#8216;no drugs or smoking&rsquo; and &#8216;no alcohol&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Community leaders in East London denounced those behind the posters as &#8216;small-minded idiots&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>As long as they don&rsquo;t actually assault women, good for them. We&rsquo;re bombarded with over-the-top sexual messages these days. People should cover up more&hellip;but not with a burka!!</p>

<p>They certainly are if they think they can stop gambling, music or concerts, porn and prostitution, alcohol and drugs and smoking. People of color have an affinity for those kinds of things. </p>

<p>- If it offends you then leave. No one is forcing you to stay in Europe. It is not your country, it was not set up under Sharia law. Brits have every right to post whatever they want in their own country.</p>

		<p>If these boys do not want to look at pictures of scantily clad women, they should not look at them, and I, as a Christian, would praise them for it.  But they do not have the right to destroy other people&rsquo;s property  &mdash;  period.</p>

		<p>It seems like a cultural thing to them to engage in homosexual types of behaviors. I heard that rape especially male on male rape is a very common practice where these folks are from. It also seems like they hate the female body. I can&rsquo;t blame them though have you ever seen a typical arabic muslim woman? Let&rsquo;s just say there is a reason they cover their faces up. Yuck.</p>

<p>hehe, in more westernized islamic states, it&rsquo;s the prettiest ones most likely to cover up. Wearing the veil is an act of modesty. </p>

		<p>It is a bit of a strange one is this. </p>
<p>On the one hand there IS too much sexual imagery all over the TV and magazines. The degradation of society seems to have long since slipped into ever deeper depravity, and we should all know that it is no accident that this culture change has happened. </p>
<p>For example, pictures of a recent &#8220;Gay Pride&#8221; march in Britain showed people walking around in fetish clothing and g-strings and whatever else, no doubt in the presence of children.</p>
<p>On that kind of score I think it has all gone way too far. Lady Ga-Ga, necrophilia on some black rapper&rsquo;s video, stores selling push up bra&rsquo;s for pre-teens, &#8216;playgirl&rsquo; logo children&rsquo;s wear etc, has become a signal of a society that has lost all direction on a moral compass. </p>
<p>However, I think that what we risk doing here by &#8216;congratulating&rsquo; the actions of these youths taking umbrage to a rather mediocre example and painting over it - is reinforcing the incorrect notion that men are not in control of their own minds or responsibilities. </p>
<p>It seems that in the Muslim mind, to show such flesh (like a woman in a bikini - especially in real life) means they are &#8220;asking for it&#8221; (ie being raped). </p>
<p>Women must cover their hair, wear veils, not show their wrists and ankles in case it sends some male over the edge with his uncontrollable urges to have his wicked way - and the excuse for women is that they are &#8220;free&#8221; and &#8220;liberated&#8221; from having to partake in fashion and &#8216;good looks&rsquo;, in that they want men to &#8220;listen to them seriously&#8221; and &#8220;not just ogle&#8221; at them.  </p>
<p>The whole idea of both of those things is insulting to me, and I think it should be insulting for any decent European male who has surpassed the dark ages of Islamic thought on these matters. </p>
<p>When Islamic women are up and down like Daleks from &#8216;Dr Who&rsquo; it is an insult to me because they are suggesting I will be uncontrollable with lust for their feminine ways if it was not for the fact they covered up and &#8216;saved it&rsquo; for the husband only. </p>
<p>When the Muslim women state with their clothing that I could not possibly take them seriously or listen to what they have to say because they are not dressed up like a bin-bag - that is an insult to me as a white, English man too. I find the notion and implication very offensive and demeaning. </p>
<p>This story of painting over advertisements is unfortunately yet another sign of Islamic dominance starting to manifest itself in European societies. </p>
<p>I suspect that it will not be too many decades from now where women will be attacked and abused in some areas of my country for wearing a close fitting T-Shirt or being stopped from coming to work in even a modest skirt that just shows the ankles (if the owner of the business is Muslim and employs a dress-code).</p>
<p>We do not want to be solving an &#8216;over sexed&rsquo; marketplace problem by congratulating and employing the mindset and culture of the medieval Islamic world. This is the thin edge of a very thick wedge. </p>
<p>The youths say it is a sin in Islam, but it is not yet an Islamic country with Islamic Sharia law presiding over the entirety of it. They thus have NO mandate to try and uphold the sensitivities of Sharia law in Britain, and to do so is in my view treason, despite the Labour government abandoning penalties treason to save their own scrawny necks. </p>
<p>If they do not like it in the meantime to this becoming an Islamic state (which all evidence seems to point towards as being a reality one day in the long future) then they should be able to lobby and protest the product manufacturers to tone it down a little. Ie, not threaten with violence, not engage in &#8220;racism&#8221; or &#8220;discriminating against my faith&#8221; action, but a little common sense that is fitting for a democracy (before it gets turned into their theocracy). </p>
<p>Already in my town we have the local swimming pool closed for Muslim sessions, where they swim up and down in some full clothing dresses with all the blinds down. Is this what we want for our future too - to never be able to wear swimwear in public because of fear of what might happen if some Muslim youths happen to take offence? </p>
<p>Maybe the making of such taboo&rsquo;s only serves to heighten the &#8220;sexualiation&#8221; of things. If wearing a bikini (or shorts and t-shirt) so you bear skin to the sunlight is deemed to be &#8220;slutty&#8221; and &#8220;sexual&#8221;, if having blonde hair on show in the breeze of a British summer time is seen as a sin and immoral behaviour - then that is not a society I want to live in, or my future descendants to live in. I will fight against such views and impositions. </p>
<p>Are we going to self sensor all our behaviours and norms in order to ever fit in with the Islamification of Europe? </p>
<p>We have enjoyed relative freedom in Europe for a very long time, especially in Britain. We have always had our own ways, our own way of looking at things and given some of the artwork that has gone on for centuries before us, the nude form of both women and men was nothing to be ashamed of. </p>
<p>Whilst I do not like the endless pushing of extreme sex, homosexuality and soft porn into the mainstream, I do not seek for my society and future generations to live in some Islamic (or other fundamentalist) puritanical repressive hell either, where table legs are covered over in case they arouse hidden sexual urges amongst us &#8216;Neanderthal&rsquo; men. </p>
<p>The balance does need addressing, but surely not like this, and surely not by having our societies Islamised. </p>
<p>These upstarts are making a point - ie: &#8220;we are taking over and we are going to do what we like&#8221;. If they cannot handle a woman posing fully clothed in a dress without getting into a tizzy over it, perhaps they should find themselves another home. </p>
<p>But of course, they do not want to go anywhere - they want to claim this land as their own, and for Muslims especially, to turn it into an Islamic compliant state first - then a fully fledged one. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m torn. What they did was definitely illegal. But in an earlier age - in America, at least - the advertisement itself might have violated public decency laws in some places. </p>
<p>Frankly I&rsquo;m sick, too, of sex and smut being shoved in our faces everywhere. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t look&#8221; you say? Well, hell man, I&rsquo;d have to walk around with my eyes shut. We&rsquo;re descending into a morass of cultural degradation where the only rights are those of pornographers working for advertisers.</p>

		<p>If its such a sin to look at a woman who is &#8220;uncovered&#8221; can someone explain to me why the Asian men who use my local gym continually leer at the white females in the swimming bath and sauna areas ?</p>
<p>Not one looks away !</p>
<p>The women have noticed the leering too and some avoid the swimming areas completely when the Asians invade.</p>
