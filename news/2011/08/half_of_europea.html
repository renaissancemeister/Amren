<h1><a href="http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFL3E7J135P20110801">Half of European Men Share King Tut&rsquo;s DNA</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alice Baghdijan, Reuters, August 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Up to 70 percent of British men and half of all Western European men are related to the Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun, geneticists in Switzerland said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The results showed that King Tut belonged to a genetic profile group, known as haplogroup R1b1a2, to which more than 50 percent of all men in Western Europe belong, indicating that they share a common ancestor.</p>
<p>Among modern-day Egyptians this haplogroup contingent is below 1 percent, according to iGENEA.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very interesting to discover that he belonged to a genetic group in Europe  &mdash;  there were many possible groups in Egypt that the DNA could have belonged to,&#8221; said Roman Scholz, director of the iGENEA Centre.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We think the common ancestor lived in the Caucasus about 9,500 years ago,&#8221; Scholz told Reuters.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the earliest migration of haplogroup R1b1a2 into Europe began with the spread of agriculture in 7,000 BC, according to iGENEA.</p>
<p>However, the geneticists were not sure how Tutankhamun&rsquo;s paternal lineage came to Egypt from its region of origin.</p>

		<p>Journalists should never be allowed to write articles on science.This is like saying one quarter of all Italians are Jews because they share haplo J2a..<br>
The haplo type is not going to tell you what Tutty looked like or where mom came from or what skin color he was, genetics doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>

		<p>Isnt it interesting that the Pharoah was European, but moreover<br>
the furthermore the most Western of the Europeans..ie Western British isles bear the greatest similarity? The political and intellectual genius of the West that rolled across Europe and then on to the British Empire, and America was linked to a specific genetic makeup and civilization went where this genotype went. </p>
<p>How could that be? I thought race was a social construct and all<br>
races were equal in their capabilities. </p>

<p>Nonsense. R1b1a2-M269 is predominantly a West European lineage tied with the Magdalenian culture. There was a study on this topic not a long time ago, desperately trying to prove the opposite. And they still repeat this obvious crap. </p>

		<p>Fascinating that modern Egyptians have little DNA in common with the ancient Eqyptians. It shows you the result of race-replacement over time. The original Egyptian stock was replaced by less intelligent Nubians and Arabs over thousands of years. No new civilization will ever rise out of Nile Delta.</p>

		<p>The lineage is likely derived from the Hyksos who invaded Egypt 150 years before Tut and assimilated into the native rulling class. According to Russian scholarship the Hyksos were from Iberia and represented part of the N.E Caucasian speaking belt stretching from Abkhazia to Anatolia, the Balkans, N. Italy to Basque country in the Iron Age. The Etruscans, Dardanians of the Troad and the Sea Peoples are part of this ethno-linguistic conglomerate of whom Abkhaz, Adyge &amp; Ubykh are still extant.</p>

		<p>Let me see now  &mdash;  how could Europeans have gotten to north Africa?  Gee, that&rsquo;s a hard one!  Furthermore, half of Western Europe is undoubtedly not DIRECTLY related to Tut, as in his descendants, but only in sharing ethnicity.  Was this writer so upset by the implication that Tut wasn&rsquo;t black that she couldn&rsquo;t think straight?  </p>

<p>You know, I always wondered why Tutankhamen and all the other &ldquo;black pharaohs&rdquo; are not portrayed in the hieroglyphics as having built a &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; based on basketball or swaggering crotch grabbing. Pyramidal concerns aside, one would think that at least Amun Ra was either a &ldquo;rap star&rdquo; or a &ldquo;diversity consultant&rdquo; of pigmentation and the hieroglyphics would at least confirm that?</p>
<p>Well, now we know what went wrong; lack of &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; not its celebration, was Egypt&rsquo;s fall. All those haplogroup R1b1a2 flight types going to Athens and Rome, when Cleopatra became queen and Nubian spacemen were out and about. <br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let the brothers know about this. They will all become terribly depressed.</p>
<p>And also let me suggest a relation to that part of Europe, northwestern Europe, that Tut is most highly linked to. 70 % of English have similar genetics to Tut. The tin mines of Cornwall were the one of the few sources of high grade tin during the Bronze Age. Bronze made by mixing copper and tin was very valuable and used by the ancient Egyptians. The ancestors of Tut were in the trade or mining of the metal and eventually settled in Egypt? Seems &#8220;March of the Titans&#8221; was right after all.<br>

		<p>Up to 70% of British men share the same genetics as King Tut.  The reason the other 30% doesn&rsquo;t is because that other 30% is mostly non-White immigrants.  King Tut, along with most of the Pharaohs, were White, until race mixing between the elite and the common non-Whites led to the down fall of the ancient Egyptian empire.</p>
<p>There is an enormous amount of archeological evidence, most of which is ignored or suppressed by the mainstream, that clearly shows that the British Isles were settled by Whites who migrated there by sea from Mesopotamia and the Levant.  For example, the Welsh language, which has puzzled linguists as to its origin, is a close variation of ancient Hebrew.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8216;experts&rsquo; have it all backwards  &mdash;  Whites and King Tut did not have a common ancestor in the Caucasus.  Their common ancestors came out of Mesopotamia  &mdash;  some Whites moved south into Egypt  &mdash;  and from there, by sea up into the British Isles.  And then later, a large number of Whites moved north into Greece, Rome, and then the Caucasus region.  But don&rsquo;t expect your multi-culturalists ever to admit the truth.</p>

		<p>I think it was already known through mummy forensics that the ancient upper class Egyptians were of European origin. When Cortes invaded Mexico in 1519, the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City)were described by the Spaniards as being &#8220;light skinned&#8221;. Modern &#8220;ancient&#8221; history is rife with political, racial and religious  interference.</p>

		<p>This is for Tutankhamen and the royal family only, not the whole of Egypt. Indeed, the article says R1b1a2 represents <i>less</i> that 1% of the haplogroups in modern Egypt. That strongly suggests Tutankhamen originated from different stock. It&rsquo;s really not that unusual for a royal family to come from a different population. For example, sometime later Alexander the Great conquered Egypt and established the Ptolemies as the ruling dynasty.</p>
<p>So if the royal family originated outside of Africa where did the other Egyptians come from? Fortunately, this article from the American Journal of Human Genetics shows that there is <a href="http://www.cell.com/AJHG/abstract/S0002-9297%2807%2962417-3" rel="nofollow">A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for Y-Chromosomal DNA Variation in North Africa</a>. In other words, North Africa was populated about twelve thousand years ago from the Middle East and NOT sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

		<p>The civilizations of the ancient world were much fairer than is depicted in schools and the media because the current inhabitants of these lands are not, and it is politically convenient to attribute the achievements of the former to the ancestors of the latter, than to admit that once again, whitey was the one doing the achieving. Interesting that with the current demographics, none are achieving anywhere remotely near their former status.</p>

		<p>  For years I&rsquo;ve endured the nonsense of Ramses II, Nefertiti, Cleopatra, and Tutankhamen were &#8220;down with the brothers.&#8221; Now geneticists have joined the chorus of those disproving this legend. For years, I&rsquo;ve told confused blacks, who believed the ancient Egyptians were black, to call the Egyptian embassy and confirm their beliefs with the embassy personnel. Now we find that modern-day Egyptians may have more in common with American blacks than their own remote ancestors.</p>

		<p>Anybody who has a 20/20 vision and likes to travel would quickly realize that North Africans, especially pure blooded Berbers are little different from Europeans (Rif Berbers are even blond and pinkish white skinned). Take Zinedine Zidane, for example.</p>
<p>The rest look like Arabs, with different levels of tanning, indicating recent Sub-saharan admixture, some are still white, gradually &#8220;whitening&#8221; as you approach towards Israel and Syria. Most of the &#8220;upper class&#8221; Arabs in the gulf are white, too.</p>
<p>Ancient Egyptians should have looked like these people, maybe with minor contributions from Indo-Europeans (in some pictures Libyans were depicted as being red-haired and light eyed) who are predominantly R1b and R1a, western and eastern respectively. </p>
<p>Probably they formed the royal class, King Tut had the same origin as the article says.</p>

		<p>What I find curious is that while 50% of western Europeans share his DNA, only 1% of Egyptians do. Obviously there has been a great deal of race-replacement going on in Egypt in the past 2,000 years. Bit by bit, Egypt&rsquo;s original, Caucasian(ish) population has been supplanted by Arabs, Nubians, etc. Coincidentally, or perhaps not coincidentally, Egypt has produced no new great civilization since and has decayed into an impoverished backwater. The fact is that great stretches of areas that are today non-white were originally peopled by Caucasians. Much of the modern-day middle east and north Africa were actually settled by whites and these civilizations were subsequently displaced over centuries. Perhaps this isn&rsquo;t so surprising. You can actually see it happening today, at incomparably faster rates in Great Britain, France etc. In a few thousand years people may be amazed to learn these areas were once 100% white. </p>

But will electromechanical and cybernetic civilization continue? This is not a certainty. There are people in the world who hate &#8220;whitey&#8221; so much that they would be willing to go back to world wide feudalism and &#8220;a world lit only by fire&#8221; to get rid of &#8220;whitey&#8221;. The attendant privations   &mdash;   short life spans, crude living conditions, extremely limited social mobility   &mdash;   are a small price to pay. No guarantee, by the way, that modern style civilization and knowledge will survive even in the Far East or the remnants of the &#8220;white&#8221; world.</p>

		<p>Stevenson at #16 makes an interesting point about the fair colouring of the ancient inhabitants of parts of the world which are not now thought of as white. He is probably aware that Homer in the Iliad wrote of &#8220;Daedalus, who wrought a dancing floor for the fair haired daughters of Libya&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Libya&#8221; in those days meant the whole of North Africa west of Egypt and was also the name of the Great Mother Goddess of the native Berbers, which brings in Deniz at #18 and his point about the Rif Berbers of Morocco among whom &#8220;fair haired daughters&#8221; can still sometimes be seen.</p>
<p>Sadly though, race replacement and mixing has gone very far in North Africa and the vast majority of todays inhabitants are of mixed Berber, Arab, and sub-Saharan descent. </p>

		<p>This is simply not true. It&rsquo;s just a loose theory that Tutty was R1b. It was spotted on a computer screen(no context) on a video made by Discovery or NGC but proves nothing whatsoever. Yet another case of Euros wanting to claim everything of any significance has their fingerprints all over it. Right. We all know Europeans invented Sanskrit and wrote the Vedas, built the Wall of China and made the first Samurai sword(only to be copied and improved upon by the Japs).</p>

		<p>If you are interested in this subject, read March of the Titans by Arthur Kemp.  His thesis is that the four great civilizations Egyptian, Greek, Rome and European were all Nordic. They were descended from the Caucasus region around the Black Sea. Why are whites called Caucasians anyway?</p>
<p>There is also a mummy in the British museum called Ginger, for the red hair.  </p>
<p>The white Egyptians were eventually displaced by Africans moving in from the South and the Semetics from the East. The statues from early Egypt are distinctly Nordic with thin faces and long thin noses. These were replaced over time through miscegination with other races, until Egypt disappeared.</p>
<p>The same thing happened to Greece and Rome, and is happening now to Europe and America. Massive immigration, miscegination and the eventual disappearance of those that built the civilization.</p>
<p>Arthur Kemp&rsquo;s works are will worth reading.</p>

The Etruscans, Dardanians of the Troad and the Sea Peoples are part of this ethno-linguistic conglomerate of whom Abkhaz, Adyge &amp; Ubykh are still extant.&#8221;</p>
<p>My understandiong of the Hyksos is that they were an Arab Semitic group that shared the region that is now Egypt until the were driven out gradually by the Indo European invasion that occurred about 5500 B.C. onward and included Alpine/Old European Mediterranean and Proto-Nordic people.</p>
<p>However, about 1785 B.C. the Hykso had amassed enough strength, uniting with Nubian Kings, to attack and defeat Egypt.  Some time later the Egyptians gained the necessary strength to drive them out completely and exacted a horrible revenge on the Nubians, thousands of which were placed in bondage. The Hyksos were never again a threat.</p>
<p>The Egyptians hated the Nubians and erected huge rocks along the southern Nile inscribed with hieroglyphics warning them they were not allowed beyond those markers.</p>
<p>From about 5600 B.C. onward, these same Old European Mediterranean types, Proto-Nordics, Alpines, and Indo-Europeans, inundated North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indus River Valley which is in what is now India. Iran and Afghanistan were populated as well by the same people.</p>
<p>At one point in Egyptian History, about 2570, the Pharoah Sneferu crushed the Nubians in a massive attack and brought back 70,000 as slaves.</p>
<p>After many, many years it was the heirs to these Nubians and the Arabs in the area that began to water down the Egyptian population until mixed races became typical of the Egyptian population.  Towards the end, mulattos held some positions of power, and at least one was a pharoah, but the glory days of Egypt were all but extinguished entirely. There was no longer mummification and no construction whatsoever.  Kind of like the US today.</p>
<p>But for blacks to claim ownership of the Egyptian dynasties is like saying they were responsible for the growth of the USA and the creators of its constitution just because they happened to be here as the hiers to slaves. </p>

<p>The  point  about  haplogroup  analysis  is  that  it  is  highly  unreliable  as  an  ethnic  marker  without  other  variables  considered.  Thus  the  Andaman  Islanders and  New  Guineans{Melanesia]  who  are  strictly  African  in phenotype  carry  Asian  haplogroups.</p>

<p>I  really  have  no  idea what  the  fuss  is  all  about.  After  all, if  humanity  began  in  Africa  &mdash;  we  have  no  proof  that the  Ancient  Egyptians  were  not  indigenous  tropically  adapted Africans [their  osteology  bears  this  out]  &mdash;  then  it  would  be  most  likely  that  the first  technological  civilization  would  be  African  &mdash;  re  writing,  building  in stone, mathematics,  science, etc.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has spent any time in Egypt would not be surprised to learn that the present-day Egyptians are unrelated to the builders of the great monuments.  Building standards are so poor - simple things like big gaps under doors and power sockets at a crazy angle.  Whenever they saw some of this shocking workmanship the group of Aussies I was with would jokingly refer to the &#8220;Egyptian Master Builders Association&#8221;. </p>

<p>What we&rsquo;re &#8220;back to&#8221; is your usual medley of distortions, misreadings and outright lies.</p>
<p>&#8220;According to Herodotus and other Greek writers the Egyptians and the Kushites were of similar ethnicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wrong, of course. Herodotus&rsquo; description of the Egyptians is most like his account of the people of Colchis (modern Georgia). The word in question is &#8220;dark,&#8221; not &#8220;black,&#8221; as that word is used in modern racial terminology.  In any case, why should the misinterpretation of  a few lines of Greek written 24 centuries ago trump modern science? Your avoidance of this simple fact beggars credulity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been confirmed by physical and genomic anthropology&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact is has not, and posters have refuted your ridiculous claims repeatedly, only to see them resurface with tedious regularity. Cite one modern scholar in a relevant discipline who claims not that the Egyptians were &#8220;African,&#8221; but that they were &#8220;black.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, if humanity began in Africa &mdash; we have no proof that the Ancient Egyptians were not indigenous tropically adapted Africans [their osteology bears this out] &mdash; then it would be most likely that the first technological civilization would be African &mdash; re writing, building in stone, mathematics, science, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>1) It does not follow at all that if humanity began in Africa that the first technological civilization must be black or African.</p>
<p>2) In fact these disciplines did not originate in Africa at all, but in the near East.</p>
<p>I suppose we should be grateful that you didn&rsquo;t supply your usual cut-and-paste erudition, or your absurd citations of nineteenth-century amateurs like J. C. Prichard as proof of your assertions.</p>

All the research and evidence from the Ancient Greeks onwards tell us that the Ancient Egyptians were African blacks of the ethnicity now found in Sudan and its environs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks regarded all of the area south of Egypt as Nubia, which included Sudan and Ethiopia.  Egypt attacked those areas many times, conquered them and returned thousands each time to Egypt as slaves.</p>
<p>King Tut was a Caucasian as were the people of the old dynasties up through King Tut, about 1250 B.C.  It&rsquo;s difficult for me to understand the poverty of intellect displayed by blacks in this country to claim ownership of Caucasoid and Arabic/Semitic history in the face of overwhelming PROOF to the contrary.</p>
<p>Are you totally unaware that King Tut&rsquo;s DNA has been determined to be within 70% of the British population and 50% within the European population as a whole, as this article verifies?</p>
<p>Does this look like a black?</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/3eag4w6</p>
<p>There are a wealth of mummies, artifacts and statues that clearly depict what the people of ancient Egypt looked like.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t begrudge blacks a chance to search for anything relevant to point to as some kind of accomplishment in their pitiful histories; however, these attempts at co-opting other people&rsquo;s history as their own is plain and simply theft.  And the greatest harm is to blacks who engage in these kinds of delusions, because they are living in a world of fantasy. How pitiful it is to steal another peoples&rsquo; history, because you have no record of achievement of your own.</p>
<p>Let me put another strain on you my delusional friend: Originally, the blacks of Nubia were in a stone-age existence, as they were&hellip;and have been&hellip;in the rest of Africa, even though they occupied the southern Nile Valley in what is now Sudan, an environment similar to the northern Nile areas developed so greatly by the Egyptians.</p>
<p>The Egyptians prospered while the Nubians were still primitives.  It wasn&rsquo;t until interaction began between the Nubians and the Hyksos people&hellip;. and the Egyptians&hellip;. that they were able to learn any kind of techniques working with metal, etc.  That is not the same as developing skills on their own, which their brothers and sisters further south failed to do as well.  Unlike the Nubians, blacks further south had no one to teach them anything and huts and spears were the best they could do. </p>
<p>You would do well to reject the black liars in the Afro-centric movement, because they will never reach a point where their revisionist lies will be accepted, and they will forever be regarded as the fools they are by the rest of the world.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that the Egyptian ruling class was fair-skinned and that some even had red hair.  I guess this finding would indicate that the early Pharaohs at least were Caucasian, if not the Egyptian people as a whole.  But they very well may have been:  if you ever look at pictures of Coptic Egyptians, who are descendents of the pre-Arab Egyptians, they appear more European (like Italians or Greeks) than most Muslim Egyptians.</p>

		<p>Like India and Persia, Egypt was in part colonized by Indo-European conquerers. The Pharaohs, or at least those of the earlier dynasties, where White.</p>

		<p>To the naysayers  above re  the ethnicity  of the  AEs:</p>
<p>So what  is  one  to  make  of  Herodotus&rsquo;s  statements  that  the  Egyptians  and  Ethiopians[ Kushites, etc.] were  &#8220;black-skinned[ Gr: &#8220;melanchroes&#8221;] and  woolly haired. </p>
<p>in  Aristotle&rsquo;s  Physiognomica  we  find  the  same  kind of  description: &#8220;too  black a  hue  as  with  Egyptians  and  Kushites[Ethiopians] marks  a  coward. The same  for being  too  white a  hue, as  is  the  case  with  women.  The  best  colour  is  the  intermediate  tawny  colour  as  one  sees  with  lions&#8221; </p>
<p>The  counter  evidence just  does  not  exist; plus  the  way  the  AEs  portrayed  themselves. Matters are  reinforced  with  the  scientific  finding  that  the  AEs  displayed  &#8220;tropical body  plans to  an  extreme  degree&#8221;.</p>
<p>Those  who  argue  that  there  must  have  been  racial  differences  between  Egyptian  and  Kushite  because  they  fought  each  other, don&rsquo;t  seem  to remember  that  Europeans  fought  each  other  continuously  over  the  centuries.</p>

		<p>&#8220;So what is one to make of Herodotus&rsquo;s statements that the Egyptians and Ethiopians[ Kushites, etc.] were &ldquo;black-skinned[ Gr: &ldquo;melanchroes&rdquo;] and woolly haired.&#8221;</p>
<p>I and others have told you many times what actual scholars make of Herodotus&rsquo; statement; in fact I told you exactly what is wrong with the ignorant afrocentric interpretation in the post to which you&rsquo;re [not] responding. Herodotus&rsquo; comment is that the Egyptians were &#8220;dark,&#8221; not &#8220;black.&#8221; That is, they were darker than Herodotus and the Greeks. Even if the word could properly be translated as &#8220;black,&#8221; assuming that this would mean what a contemporary English speaker would mean by the same word is, at best, extraordinarily naive. For the second time, H. applies the same adjective to the people of Colchis (modern Georgia). They too are &#8220;dark.&#8221; I suppose Stalin was actually a black African, no?</p>
<p>&#8220;The same for being too white a hue, as is the case with women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow  &mdash;  according to the principles of interpretation you&rsquo;ve established, Aristotle must be asserting that all women are Caucasian; that&rsquo;s what a &#8220;white&#8221; hue must mean, right?</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The counter evidence just does not exist&#8221;</p>
<p>The counter evidence exists, among other places, in the news item to which these comments are attached. There is in fact quite an extensive scholarly literature on this topic; DNA studies, forensic anthropology and myriad other tools of modern inquiry have put the lie to &#8220;black Tut&#8221; as thoroughly as any thesis regarding ancient history can be refuted. That you ignore all of this, responding instead with the same two or three misquoted passages from ancient authors you&rsquo;ve never read, tells us all we need to know about your abilities and integrity. </p>
<p>Again: why should the virtually unanimous consensus of modern scholarship be discarded on in favor of baseless and uninformed assertions advanced by some internet personality?</p>

		<p>I found it interesting when Scientists found Mummies in China which were of the White Race. Many had blond and red hair. </p>
<p>Along with the remains, the Scientists found clothing, with a familiar Tartan weave pattern, that looks like a Scottish Tartan, or those found in ancient, Celtic Gaul. </p>
<p>For a real eye-opener go to You Tube and watch the video, &#8220;Ice Age Columbus&#8221; and find out who Scientists say were here in North America, first.</p>

		<p>You cannot argue with an Afrocentrist any more than you can argue religion with a Muslim.  It is not that they do not understand the arguments against their beliefs.  The difficulty lies in their utter faith in their delusions.</p>
<p>You may as well explain to a good Muslim that Mohammed was a child abusing misogynist who advocated lying and cheating his neighbors as to explain to an Afrocentrist that Cleopatra was not Maya Angelou.</p>
<p>If in some future world, we could take a picture of Mohammed as he was &#8216;entering&rsquo; Aisha, a devout Muslim would simply ignore it proclaim it a lie or find a convoluted justification for it.  It is the same with Afrocentrists, even with a mountain of evidence against them, there is no way they will give up their beliefs.  It is not a matter of knowledge but of Faith.</p>
<p>If I found out tomorrow I was 100% Neandertal or an alien from Alpha Centari I could not care less.  However, I do not have my identity bound up in a fantasy world view where my ancestors (despite all evidence to the contrary) invented everything from Fire to the Space Shuttle and all of that in sub-Saharan Africa 2000 BC.</p>
