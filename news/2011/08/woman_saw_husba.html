<p>Andrea Isom, My Fox Detroit, August 10, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Beverley Dunn, 32, was watching &#8220;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&#8221; one Saturday night, which wasn&rsquo;t unusual. She rarely missed an episode. However, one show Dunn caught back in 2005 took her breath away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was kind of frozen, dumbstruck,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was very shocking and it sent chills up my back because I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The name wasn&rsquo;t the same, but she was sure the bad guy on the screen was the man she called her husband, Jacer Medina, who she knew as Santiago Hernandez, and the father of her two little boys. According to the case on &#8220;American&rsquo;s Most Wanted,&#8221; the man she married was wanted for murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanted for a murder that happened four years before we married,&#8221; Dunn told FOX 2&rsquo;s Andrea Isom. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t know who he was. I didn&rsquo;t know who I married.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunn said he came home just in time for the recap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The color from his face just (went) away, and I said, &#8216;That&rsquo;s you,'&#8221; she explained. &#8220;He kept denying it, and finally when I just kept on about it, he (said), &#8216;Okay, fine. What if that is me? If it is me, then I&rsquo;m going to do exactly what I did to that man to you if you tell anybody.'&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He would slap me and hit me so hard I went deaf in my ear for awhile, so I knew what he was capable of,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t want it to get worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, in 2008, her family stepped in and broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;They called &#8216;America&rsquo;s Most Wanted&rsquo; for me,&#8221; Dunn told us. &#8220;(She) said &#8216;my sister was married to him&rsquo; because at the time that she called I had already gotten a divorce.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to police in Illinois, in 1994 Dunn&rsquo;s ex-husband was driving drunk. A good Samaritan saw him and called police. Four months later, he came back, hunted that man down and shot him six times, killing him out of revenge.</p>
