			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KHQ, August 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police reports filed in Latah County reveal a former Associate Professor at the University of Idaho, who police say shot and killed a graduate student then himself, was a self-admitted &#8220;psychopathic killer&#8221; who threatened the student several times with a gun before he shot and killed her on Monday.</p>
<p>According to the roommates of 22-year-old Katy Benoit, the student was sexually involved with Ernesto Bustamante, but broke things off in March. Friends say Benoit claimed the former professor threatened her several times with a gun and even put the gun in her mouth at one point.</p>
<p>A friend of Bustamante told police that he owned several handguns and had multiple personality disorders, one which he called &#8220;psychopathic killer&#8221; and another he called &#8220;the beast.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to the documents Benoit filed a complaint with the University of Idaho against Bustamante in June. Bustamante was either fired or allowed to resign on Friday as a result of the complaint.</p>

								<h2>University of Idaho Student Shot, Killed Was from Boise</h2>
						<p>{snip} Benoit earned her undergraduate degree last year and started her first year as a graduate student in the psychology department this fall, according to the university.</p>
<p>Bustamante was an assistant professor in the university&rsquo;s Department of Psychology and Communication, earning a base salary of $51,000 a year, when he resigned his position with the school last Friday. Bustamante had been with the school since August 2007 after graduating from Old Dominion University in Virginia with a doctorate degree in human factors psychology, according to his resume.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Katy was a beautiful, intelligent and musically talented woman and we are so saddened by her tragic death. She was looking forward to her graduate studies and excited about her future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Katy was a friend to many people and loving daughter, sister, granddaughter, niece and cousin. Thank you to our many friends and the communities of Moscow and Boise for your love, support and prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>Moscow-Pullman Daily News</em> reports police could not confirm if the relationship between the two was strictly professional, though Idaho&rsquo;s Dean of Students Bruce Pitman noted there was a university policy that bars faculty members from entering into romantic relationships with students.</p>

		<p>So another White girl takes up with a non White and winds up dead for the choices she made. When are the media and Hollyweird going to tell young White women the truth about the dangers of minorities? Instead they get bombarded from all sides about how wonderful mixed race relationships are and how &#8220;racist&#8221; you would be if you didnt date a non White. This poor young lady is every bit as much as a victim of the &#8220;mtv set&#8221; as she is from this murderous latino. </p>

		<p>Here is a story about an affirmative action hispanic cop who is a serial rapist.  He is also about 40 pounds over the weight limit.  </p>
<p>Drunken off-duty NYPD cop charged with rape.NYPD </p>
<p>NYPD is investigating whether a cop busted for allegedly attacking a school teacher in upper Manhattan last week is a serial rapist.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly made the startling disclosure Thursday when asked about Officer Michael Pena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investigators have picked out some [cases] that they think have the potential of having been perpetrated by this individual,&#8221; Kelly said.</p>
<p>Police released few details on the other attacks, saying only that they happened during the three years Pena has been on the force. Kelly didn&rsquo;t say where the other unsolved sex assaults occurred.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Pena, 27, was drunk about 6:45 a.m. on Aug. 19 when he approached a woman and asked her for directions. They said the off-duty cop showed the 25-year-old Bronx teacher his department-issued 9-mm handgun.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re coming with me,&#8221; he told the woman, according to police sources.</p>
<p>The woman was dragged behind a building in Inwood and raped, police said. Officers from the 34th Precinct said they arrived to find the cop and the woman dressed, his gun on the ground.</p>
<p>Pena, held on $500,000 bail, was indicted Wednesday. Assigned to the 33rd Precinct, the three-year cop has been suspended from the NYPD.</p>
<p>Since the arrest, investigators have been checking DNA and police sketches for possible connections to other rapes.</p>
<p>Kelly called the rape &#8220;a very, very disturbing case,&#8221; and said the department has also been scrutinizing Pena&rsquo;s department records and his screening process.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met with psychologists, the head of applicant processing - everyone that was involved with his coming into the department,&#8221; Kelly said. &#8220;We found nothing remarkable, nothing exceptional in his background, that in hindsight should have been done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kelly said it was &#8220;very disturbing that anyone with that tendency, or that potential, that capability at all, is a member of the New York City Police Department.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Margaret poster #2, Ray Kelly and his boss Mike Bloomberg will never ever say or think anything bad about minority thugs who happen to be cops. Kelly is forever chirping and gloating that his department is now less than 50% White Male. I have a feeling he probably is of the same mind set as the Army Chief of Staff, that is these crimes by minority cops are &#8220;disturbing&#8221; but any loss of this precious diversity would be a greater tragedy. What in the name of God makes so called intelligent people think this way?</p>

<p>You can add to that the dangers naive white women face from &#8220;sleazy&#8221; men of their own color. This story makes me think back to something I heard during the AIDS epidemic era of the 1980. One news feature declared white women the &#8220;barrier&#8221; between the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; of society and the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>In response to this situation, white women were supposed to stop having relations with mainstream heterosexual white men. No one came out and told them to stop having relations with minority men and indentifiably &#8220;sleazy&#8221; white men, such as hoodlum types, IV drug users, and admitted or likely bisexuals.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, did anyone warn heterosexual white men to stay away from women who dated minority men and sleazy white guys? I don&rsquo;t recall that happening, but under the &#8220;barrier&#8221; theory, it would have been a prudent recommendation. If you think it out carefully, another case of blame the victim.</p>

		<p>Based the kind of people who make up the younger NYPD officers, I&rsquo;m expecting the the NYPD to lose effectiveness and the crime rate to sky rocket in the near future.  It seems they are mostly recruiting short, fat Hispanics with some short, fat Asians thrown in.  It&rsquo;s hard to believe how physically unfit the younger officers in the NYPD are compared to the younger officers in suburban police departments.</p>

The message here would be, if you hire criminal incompetents, your job is on the line, too! </p>
<p>Alas! If only that were true in today&rsquo;s merit-less, affirmative action policies that <i>disallow</i> the best candidates from even reaching the first base in police recruitment standards. </p>

		<p>Poster # 4</p>
<p>Latest news from the Center for Disease control is that homosexual men although only 2 percent of the population are 66 percent of new AIDS cases.  This after 40 years of AIDS education.</p>
<p>Someone who worked for social security disability once told me that every woman she interviewed for disability who got on disability because of AIDS got the AIDS from a bisexual man, sometimes husbands. It was the most depressing job.</p>
<p>Remember that AIDS is a hetero disease and will soon destroy the population of the earth media campaign?  Example of the media lies and lies and lies over the last 70 years.</p>

<p> - As a doc who remembers the situation well I can tell you a couple things;  1. Men spread HIV easier than women because the body fluid carrying HIV flows into the female and not back to the male.  2. Syringe sharing among addicts is the common method for transmission of HIV between drug users.  3.  Gay men were most affected due to engagements in sexual conducts that typically tore membranes, allowing infected semen entry into the system.  As a result, straight, clean white men were and remain the safest sex partners, regardless of how &#8220;sleazy&#8221; they are viewed by others.  4.  Statistically, blacks are infected in far greater numbers than whites.  Conclusion; DON&rsquo;T HAVE SEX WITH BLACKS, AND DON&rsquo;T DO DRUGS. </p>

<p>Universities are anxious to diversify their faculties, so they hire assistant profs according to non-whiteness.  The &#8216;must-haves&rsquo; checklist includes blacks, Asians, Latinos, Arabs or East Indians.</p>
<p>How many qualified whites are passed over for these coveted positions we&rsquo;ll never know.<br/>

<p>I suspect they more or less HAD to hire him, barring any specific evidence why they should not.  Diversity is the shibboleth now, while competence and everything else come after that. If they didn&rsquo;t hire him, and others like him, the Department would be empty of recruits. Where are you going to find large numbers of competent, honest, fit young white men in the City nowadays? Most of their families had fled to the remote suburbs long ago.</p>

<p>Political pressure. And orders from the hand that feeds him.</p>
<p>His boss, Mayor Bloomberg, at whose pleasure he serves, thinks that minorities and immigration are just WONDERFUL. Kelly has to toe the line, if he likes his job. Kelly has had a long run;  he knows how to play the game. </p>
<p>So it is with police chiefs and such. They don&rsquo;t make their own policies, and their words have to be carefully chosen. They are just functionaries for the politicians that pay them.</p>

		<p>While many qualified people were passed over to put another minority on the payroll, at least Bustamante is no longer with us. How soon until his spot is filled by a disabled lesbian mulatto? Also, Norfolk police might start looking into their cold case files and see if Bustamante might have been involved with some unsolved murders. That is if they are not too busy railroading sailors with crimes committed by minorities (Look up &#8220;The Norfolk Four&#8221; on Google).</p>
<p>If you want to see night and day differences between agencies with large minority populations and those with mostly white populations, go to www.hulu.com and find &#8220;The Academy&#8221;. Seasons one and two follow recruit classes through the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. You look at some of those who made it into the LASD and shake your head. Every color and orientation under the rainbow. Most of the instructors were Black or Hispanic, however they did not appear to be AA admits to the department. I would imagine that the White males who applied probably had to vastly outscore everyone else to even get an interview. </p>
<p>Season three follows a recruit class through the Orange County Fire Authority. As for the Fire Department. One Asian, a few Hispanics, and the rest White Males. One recruit played American Football with NFL Europe a few years ago. All three seasons are worth watching.  </p>

		<p>If within tax supported universities, it was declared that the classroom &amp; seminar utterances are public and subject to continuous video/audio recording  &mdash;  well, there would be political earthquakes soon enough.  Most people with the luggage this guy appears to have had would have been fired just from seeing how they perform, fail to perform, on duty, on the job.  Some institution like the University of Idaho  &mdash;  useful but not exactly Harvard  &mdash;  would do well not to hold teaching in disdain and not to exalt itself as merely &#8220;subject centered&#8221;.  The emotional-social demands of effective teaching, given public visibility,  would weed out most of these mental casualties very very quickly.  Of course, teaching is a bit too close to the traditional function of the university for the PC &#8220;campus red guards &#8221;  to tolerate it very long.   </p>
