<h1><a href="/">Rot in Hell!: Elizabeth Wright-Calling Her a &#8216;Sellout&rsquo; Would Be Charitable</a></h1>

<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: Hat tip to Alternative Right for bringing this example of liberal tolerance to our attention.</em>]</p>
<p>How bad was Elizabeth Wright? She was a black woman, and we heard of her death via American Renaissance, complete with tribute to her written by Jared Taylor! Wright was one of those utterly despicable black conservatives that didn&rsquo;t just cover for white racism, she was a total apologist for white supremacists. In 1985, she started publishing the newsletter Issues &#038; Views, and although she had this mantra that it &#8220;was derived from the wisdom of earlier generations of American blacks, like Booker T. Washington, who attempted to steer their people towards greater economic self-reliance,&#8221; but to her that meant being conciliatory and a segregationist in many respects. She was no fan of multiculturalism, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from defending neo-Confederacy. She was also a supporter of Holocaust deniers David Irving and Ernst Zundel while they were in jail, railed against the Civil Rights Act as &#8220;forced integration&#8221;, supported the stunt being promoted by white supremacists that the Republican Party focus only on reaching out to white voters and not anyone else and also had time to cry about the American Renaissance Conference being shut down in Charlotte, NC this year (we didn&rsquo;t even know she had written about that until we started writing this). {snip} As we write this, the news has spread, but only to other white supremacist blogs. Seriously, if your legacy as a person of color has people who downright despise black people mourning your death as a collegue [sic], it is probably pretty wise to hide your face. This woman will not be missed.</p>
