<h1><a href="https://www.christianpost.com/news/muslim-veil-ban-passed-by-italy-53241/">Italy Latest Country to Approve Burqa-Ban</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ivana Kvesic, The Christian Post, August 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Italian parliamentary commission approved a draft law on Tuesday that would ban women from wearing veils that cover their face in public.</p>
<p>The law will be forwarded to the Italian parliament following summer recess, and if the law passes, Italy would be the third European country to ban face veils following France and Belgium.</p>
<p>The law was sponsored by Souad Sbai, a member of the conservative Freedom People Party born in Morocco. He has stated in a phone interview, &#8220;Five years ago, no-one wore the burqa in Italy. Today, there is always more. We have to help women get out of this segregation &hellip; to get out of this submission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sbai added that according to some reports an estimated 3,000 women across Italy cover their faces.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some critics have called the ban racist since the majority of female Muslims across Europe do not actually wear the veil and argue that Islam does not require women to go out in public with a fully covered face.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If passed, Italy&rsquo;s ban will fine third parties that force women to cover their face in public 30,000 Euros and they could face up to 12 months in jail.</p>

<p>• Indonesia, which is the most populated Muslim country in the whole world, is an Asian country.</p>
<p>• Albania, which is a white country, is Islamic.</p>
<p>• There are Christian minorities in Arabic or Arabic-speaking countries like Egypt and Palestine.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m saying is that Islam is not exclusive to any one particular race. Anyone with half a brain can see this obvious fact. I am therefore lead to believe that the term &#8220;racist&#8221; is only being employed as a means of silencing opponents.</p>
<p>This may initially sound strange coming from a race-realist like myself, but I think it is actually a <i>good</i> thing that the traitors to our people and civilization call laws racist when race isn&rsquo;t even in the equation. The more you abuse demonizing terms like &#8220;racist,&#8221; the more cliché and impotent they become.</p>

<p>So Islam is a race now? Silly me, all this time I thought it was a religion. </p>
<p>Oh wait, I get it now.  They are using the word &#8220;racism&#8221; in its technical Orwellian sense meaning &#8220;something that diversicrats don&rsquo;t like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;When I use a word,&rsquo; Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, &#8216;it means just what I choose it to mean  &mdash;  neither more nor less.&rsquo;    &mdash;  -Through the Looking Glass</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but if the vast majority of Muslim women do NOT wear burkas, then how can a ban on them be considered discriminatroy towards Muslims?</p>
<p>And as others have pointed out, &#8220;Islam&#8221; is not a race.  In fact, the majority of Muslims are not even Arabic - the race most commonly associated with them.  If I remember correctly, the percentage of Muslims who are Arabic is around 20%.  Many are Asian, black, and even white (Albanians, Bosnians, Persians, plus some converts in western countries).</p>

<p>Actually Islam is a totalitarian political ideology and death cult, cleverly combined and packaged to appear as a religion. Still, it doesn&rsquo;t make the &#8220;racist&#8221; smear any less ridiculous.</p>
<p>At any rate, a mere burqa ban isn&rsquo;t enough. Italy needs to declare all Muslims <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/persona+non+grata" rel="nofollow"><i>persona non grata</i></a> and give them a reasonable period (3-4 months, perhaps) to get their affairs in order and leave the country. If just one government did this, the rest of Europe might well follow suit.</p>
