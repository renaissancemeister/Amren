			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John T. Bennett, American Thinker, August 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Recent flash mob violence has alerted Americans to a troubling wave of sadistic racial mayhem.  A notable outbreak occurred in Denver in 2009, setting a pattern of delay, denial, and silence.  Now that same scourge has returned to Denver, among many other places.  </p>
<p>In 2009, a four month wave of mayhem broke out in Denver. There were at least 26 violent robberies committed by two black gangs.  The victims were  &mdash;  without exception  &mdash;  whites and Hispanics.  When the dust settled from that initial spate of violence, victims were left with injuries ranging from a skull fracture to broken noses and shattered eye sockets.  The local Denver ABC news affiliate summarized the crime spree:</p>
<blockquote>Black gangs roaming downtown Denver often vented their hatred for white victims before assaulting and robbing them during a four-month crime wave, according to interviews and court records obtained by 7NEWS.</blockquote>
<p>That is not the language of a conservative commentator; it&rsquo;s simply a mainstream local news report from an American city that has witnessed widespread racial violence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An incredible 38 people were arrested in connection with this campaign of racist violence. Thirty  were ultimately charged, all black.  Has this number of arrests been made against any violent white supremacist or right wing organization in the last 50 years?</p>
<p>The story first came to light in 2009 when a source inside the Denver police department said that the department was &#8220;keeping the public in the dark&#8221; about the attacks.  Court documents show that the police did indeed have knowledge of a pattern of racial attacks, but remained silent for 27 days.  One victim complained that, had the police informed the public sooner, he could have protected himself.  {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The brutality  in Denver is disturbingly similar to violence occurring elsewhere, nationwide.  In the last few months alone, a young white lady named Shaina Perry was taunted and beaten in Milwaukee.  A young white man named Carter Strange had his skull fractured by a mob in South Carolina.  Dawid Strucinski was beaten into a coma by a mob in Bayonne.  Anna Taylor, Emily Guendelsberger, andThomas Fitzgerald were beaten and kicked to the ground in separate Philadelphia flash mobs.  Every weekend in July, mobs have attacked in Greensboro, NC.  In a mostly-white suburb of Cleveland, witnesses reported large groups of &#8220;teens&#8221; walking through the streets, &#8220;shouting profanities and racial epithets,&#8221; and one man was viciously beaten while leaving a restaurant with his wife and friends.  In all of those cases, the victims were white and the attackers were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It cannot be emphasized enough that these attacks often occur in suburban areas where the black groups have to leave their own neighborhoods and purposefully travel to areas that are predominantly non-black, to attack non-black victims. {snip}</p>
<p>There is quite simply no way for a politically correct society to grasp these events, much less effectively deal with them. Liberals have reached the depths of self-deception and self-censorship in response. The Washington Post, New York Times, and the Chicago Tribune, have all openly stated that they will refuse  to report on the racial facts of these violent crimes. The Los Angeles Times explains that they don&rsquo;t want to &#8220;unfairly stigmatize racial groups.&#8221; They prefer the soft bigotry of low expectations instead. </p>
<p>These flash mobs have turned the comfortable narrative of racism on its head. Politicians, the media, academics, and the legal community do not have the capacity to face the issue. The reigning dogma of white racism is too deeply entrenched. {snip} The PC status quo will not acknowledge the fact that the worst form of racism today is black mob violence.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t believe many of us blame the ordinary beat cop for this situation.  After all, their families are just as threatened as the rest of us. In fact, they often risk life and limb only to be frustrated by the corrupt political/legal/academic activist complex.</p>
<p>The police leadership, though, is often a different matter entirely. By their very nature they have achieved their superior positions because they are ambitious. As such,they depend on staying in the good graces of the often corrupt agenda driven political class who oversee them. Many of them, in fact, were selected for the very reason that their views conform with the views of the corrupt politicians who appointed, and who oversee them.</p>
<p>Let us not forget that the highly agenda driven Chief Moose discounted eyewitness accounts indicating the &#8220;Beltway snipers&#8221; may have been &#8220;Blacks&#8221;.  Moose had his beat cop subordinates wasting their time searching for White people.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Police spokesman Sonny Jackson denied that police delayed warning the public for seven weeks to avoid frightening visitors to the popular and lucrative downtown entertainment district.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said police had to confirm &#8220;a pattern of behavior&#8221; before going public.&#8221;</p>
<p>This &#8220;pattern of behavior&#8221; has been ongoing for at least the past 50 years, although only recently in such an organized manner. How much more time does the Government and its police leadership need to confirm this?</p>

		<p>The black thugs organize as a group and target single white individuals. Therefore the best thing to do in response, is to go in groups. Because the black thugs attack opportunistically in groups, white groups which show both a mental and physical force posture and awareness will be bypassed. This type of group American e.g. white behavior was common practice all the way up into the 1970&rsquo;s especially in the cities. Even before non-white groups arrived in numbers, one can see old 1920s-1940&rsquo;s pictures and see people almost always travelled in groups when going to large public events.  The only hope is to similarly organize as before.</p>
<p>Travel in groups to the cities, is a vital necessity in today&rsquo;s environment. It should be as a minimum of three but only as a last resort, otherwise large groups. This however creates a problem. Because white liberals are indoctrinated to such an extent, one cannot expect them to both understand the need to organize a group for activities AND respond as a group to the Black thugs if attacked. </p>
<p>This means, we must organize those of similar thinking as we, we who are free and mentally liberated. Do not travel alone and certainly do not travel alone to areas where you have seen blacks congregate. Additionally, when travelling as a group make sure your armed. Whether it be asps, batons, knives, brass knuckles, and preferably firearms. If one must travel alone, one must certainly travel with firearms and be prepared mentally and physically to lay several of these blacks down on the ground in self-defense if attacked.</p>
<p>The sociological norms of non-whites has like always in the past gone increasingly violently racist in response to white appeasement. Historical facts are clear. When whites open their society to non-whites and stop demanding accountability of non-white pathological behavior, non-white society starts racing toward ever more violent group action. Americans practiced this type of weak altruism with the Indians in the early 1600&rsquo;s of Virginia and saw at least half of their communities massacred by sudden Indian attacks on various occasion. Such massacres almost always correlate with American appeasement or weakness toward Indian provocations.  Additionally, regarding black gangs, both free black and indentured blacks made sudden and violent attacks on white communities when history had shown Americans to have become weak. Only individual vigilance, group action, social accountability, and the willingness to use force in kind has ever kept such attacks at bay. Given the vast pathological bent of most whites toward craven cowardice in the face of racist attacks, this means Americans can really only rely upon people like ourselves. This in turn means we must increase our social interactions with intelligent people of our own kind, who have reasonable critical thinking skills, and above all, an ability and willingness to defend not just themselves but their fellow men. Above all, it means, learning how to individually fight, gaining the individual weapons to fight, and ultimately, training together with those like ourselves. That way when travelling, we will be safe and be able to enjoy what remains of the peace and tranquility of this generation.  </p>

		<p>Blacks will whine when stopped by cops that they are &#8216;Driving While Black&rsquo;, though this is perfectly rational on the part of the police since blacks are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. I wonder how many black lives were saved when police officers &#8216;racially profile&rsquo;? </p>
<p>Black thugs attack any White person they come upon. We might describe this as being attacked for &#8216;Existing While White&rsquo;. By constantly being in a state of denial in regards to all things racial, the MSM makes excuses for the black thugs and their own brand of &#8216;racial profiling&rsquo;: all Whites are guilty and deserve violence. </p>

		<p>For us racially-conscious whites, this type of black behavior is not surprising.  We know the vast majority of blacks either commit violents act or are easily capable of committing violent acts.  Many of us know the civil rights movement was a propaganda program that is part of the global, one world government, agenda.  Collectivism.  What shocks most of us is that they were able to pull it off so beautifully with little to no resistance.  But, sooner or later this is going to blow and God help everything and everyone that walks upright!<br>

		<p>Agreed. </p>
<p>The first rule is not to be concerned about what others think. That&rsquo;s what got us here in the first place. And should (when) the first attack occurs against a white group, and it is met with a forcible response, you can bet blacks will start making all kinds of noise and (some) whites will cravenly join them. </p>
<p>However, it will be necessary to just ignore it. Everyone knows who holds the moral high road should such an event occur.</p>
<p>By continuing, and facing (prevailing in) another confrontation, and another, the press and the blacks and the liberals will grow weary and in time it will be accepted behavior.</p>
<p>Once that happens just wait until some guilty liberal whites get attacked. I guarantee you the first thing they will do is look for a white, armed group to walk with the next time they venture into their multi-cultural urban paradise.</p>
<p>While blacks are none too bright they will soon understand that the party is over and they behave like that at their own risk.</p>
<p>Of course, the media and their black enablers - from The NY Times to the ADL to the SPLC, etc,,, - will be on 24-hour watch looking for provocation from any whites in a group. In response, whites need to take extra care to avoid even the appearance of inciting violence.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a neighbor whose cousin is in the Israeli army and is deployed at times in the West Bank. Because of the level of intensity and media scrutiny plus the Palestinian agitators placed there solely to generate a response from Israeli troops - the soldiers are trained to remain absolutely aware and in control and not let their emotions override their duty to limit the use of force - but be sudden and overwhelming if it comes to it.</p>
<p>My point is - this is what it has come down to. It sickens me to think that parts of our country have turned into a middle eastern propaganda no-go zone with whites seen as the enemy. </p>
<p>On the other hand if we stand our ground and organize we can overcome these obstacles. Small victories at first build the foundations for far greater success years down the road.</p>

		<p>We all know that if roaming gangs of whites were attacking blacks at random in city after city, this would be a gigantic news story. There would be a barrage of coverage from the Communist News Network (CNN), the Washington Post, the US Today and every other major left-wing news outlet in existance. They would carp endlessly about these &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; and &#8220;racist violence&#8221; and the need for swift, decisive action. <br>
    Although what I&rsquo;m afraid could end up happening is that an armed shop owner somewhere (possibly a foreighner) will have his business invaded by a throng of black flashmobers, and in response to this he will open fire on them. Many will end up injured or killed and this event will spark an old fasioned black riot in that city. </p>

		<p>If you want a little history lesson on racial mayhem in New York City, I recommend that you catch &#8220;Nightmare in the City That Never Sleeps&#8221; on CNBC.  A lot of younger AMREN readers may not be aware of a blackout that occurred in the seventies in which hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses were destroyed.  The footage shows an overwhelming preponderance of very dark faces in the midst of an orgy of destruction, theft, and general mayhem and lawlessness.  It&rsquo;s also an opportunity for a glance at a text book case of the destructive forces of the policies of the extreme left.</p>

		<p> 50 years of entitlement, decades of exploitation by self appointed race hustling poverty pimps, an attorney general who excuses black on white crimes and more recently the fanning of the race rage fire by desperate democrat politicians.  All of this has created a race based social group which feels empowered to butcher us for little more than instant gratification.  It is rapidly reaching a point of survival for the civilized citizenry of this nation.  In the interest of self preservation, it may be time to take the guns and ammunition most of us have been buying and put them in our pockets so that we can protect ourselves and our families when we are at home or in public.  The inability of our law enforcement and judicial system to prevent or respond to this collapse of society leaves few other options. The horrible and historically proven truth may be, the only option remaining for the preservation of our way of life is for the citizenry to respond to this violence with much worse violence.  I fear the situation will become much worse before the inevitable occurs.  </p>

Virtually every white person I know believes that nov&rsquo;12 is going to be the kickoff of our black brothers campaign of racial war. They are aquireing weapons and trainging with them.

		<p>&#8220;Has this number of arrests been made against any violent white supremacist or right wing organization in the last 50 years?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the NAACP [and who could disagree with the statistics of the NAACP] about 40 &#8220;minority&#8221; were killed by &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; during a thirty year period. That is about four persons every three years, and that in a nation of now 300 million. VERY small statistically! And as I said, if the NAACP says it is so, it MUST be so.<br>

		<p>obviously what is needed is a form of the SA for want of a better term.  If the police cannot or will not protect you the choice is then to be a professional victim or to protect yourself.  Self defense is legal.  This will take a vast effort on the part of the white folk.  Manly pride and physical training will need to be revived in the white race.  Basic gladiator training is needed.  Get on with it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be like telling someone &#8220;if you go into the woods, there is a creature in there that is very dangerous.  It isn&rsquo;t important to describe it, but it is very dangerous.:</p>

&#8220;No, if you ask one of them to be quiet in the theater, he will get violent.&#8221;<br>
&#8220;is it Robert Dinero from Cape Fear?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;No.  These teens have a cruel humor and harm people for fun&#8221;<br>
&#8220;The cast of Twilight?&#8221;<br>
&#8220;sigh.  No.&#8221;</p>
<p>I need some kind of a suit that sprays lye, darts, or something dangerous in a radius around me, so that if I ever encounter a group of &#8220;youths&#8221; I can discharge it as a squid would its ink and make my escape.

		<p>The fact that our government is clearly against use in this and ever matter regarding black on white attacks. The ring of power can not obtained be without a grass roots effort.We will die as a race if do nothing. Whites need to get rid of old animosity&rsquo;s against our brothers and sisters in Europe.The people in Europe are ready for a change considering they are occupied lands now with 50 million Muslims.Thinking of the whole western hemisphere as ours is true because our forefathers planned it and built it. start with local politicians to build from the ground up but don&rsquo;t forget to link with our people in or global neighborhood to share successes and failures and in doing build a united movement for good.</p>

		<p>The most important takeaway from all this is that the posters on mainstream media seem to sound like the posters on this site! For a long time, this sort of violence has been the Elephant in the Room, there, but not spoken of; now, even the readers of local newspapers are venting as to the outrageous outbursts of criminality. What is missing though, is any effort by the major media to allow the whole country to see what is happening. The news outlets are supressing (&#8220;spiking&#8221;) these stories, so, say, someone living in Virginia does not hear about an event occuring in Pennsylvania.</p>

		<p>The Washington Post, New York Times, and the Chicago Tribune, have all openly stated that they will refuse to report on the racial facts of these violent crimes. The Los Angeles Times explains that they don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;unfairly stigmatize racial groups.&rdquo;<br>

- John T. Bennett, American Thinker, August 30, 2011<br>
 <br>
A number of years ago I read an article in The New York Times that said liberals do not like to be told facts that reflect poorly on blacks and gays. Fortunately, enough news media are reporting the truth about this. Yesterday I watched a news story on television about it. </p>

		<p>  One or all these things will happen with-in the next 12 to 18 months. A local celebrity or a family member will suffer an attack from a flash mob. A flash mob will murder someone.<br>
A flash mob  will attack an off-duty police officer or CCP holder. A number of attackers will be wounded or killed. Attempts will be made to prosecute the shooter on the grounds of excessive force. In the run up to the 2012 presidential election mob violence will be threatened if a Obama loss occurs. Mob violence will occur due to the Obama loss. Blacks will attempt to prevent white voters from voting. The MSM will obsess over non-existent white-on-black violence. The MSM will start to insinuate that whites defending themselves or attempting to defend themselves from black violence is racist. Flash mobs will start to occur in middle class suburban neighborhoods.</p>

<p>In response, I see your point but disagree to the extent of my being clueless or deceptive.</p>
<p>While the 1960s and the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; riots were slightly before my time I may have the limitation of the present restricting my full view of the past. I do not trust what I read of the era as history is re-written and lies become accepted fact.</p>
<p>I can only look around and deal with present and go from there. </p>
<p>Why agitators and alien elements, as you say, unleashed this monster, is hard to say. I have a difficult time believing that it was an organized, deliberate effort to upend society - which was the end result -  but I suppose it can be seen that way. </p>
<p>At first I saw it as a misguided effort by liberals, leftist Jews, passive church leaders, and others who felt some odd empathetic kinship with blacks who they had no personal contact with. It seems odd that they would plan a destruction of a culture where they too would become victims. But these groups of suicidal whites think in a way which I cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>I then try to see what benefits they would gain from dismantling segregation - the only real way to - at minimum - maintain a stable society. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason why - and that is the REAL question - I personally cannot change what happened. I can, however, work to root out traitors and marginalize their efforts at this point. Just because they started it doesn&rsquo;t mean it can&rsquo;t be finished and their destructive actions reversed.       </p>

		<p>It is the crazy white liberal who holds the key to a future safe for whites. With about 30% of the white population, anti-white (e.g. MSNBC kooks) the rest of us face an enormous obstacle. As long as these nuts have influence, black ani-social behavior will be excused and/or dismissed. No other race has the equivalent.</p>

		<p><i>These flash mobs have turned the comfortable narrative of racism on its head.</i></p>
<p>Except that this has been going on for 50 years and these flash mobs aren&rsquo;t even a particularly bad example of the phenomenon.  Conservatives criticize Liberals as if they were worried about the Left&rsquo;s Liberal soul.   They don&rsquo;t lack the capacity to confront the issue, they have no desire to do so.  They sponsor white-hating racist violence and get benefits from it,  not the least of which is the very real joy they get upon seeing whites degraded and tortured.  Whining that Liberals are psychologically anguished over this violence makes them the victims instead of the perpetrators that they are.  They are criminals, the ones being beaten are the victims.  </p>

<p>I keep hearing that canard, that whites needn&rsquo;t worry about formal reconquista or irredentism because it&rsquo;s only a fringe mentality among Hispanics.</p>
<p>True, but moot.</p>
<p>If/when the American Southwest becomes 100% Chicano, will it really matter which country it&rsquo;s in?  It will be one big Mexican barrio, regardless of which national capital to which the few working people there pay income taxes.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:  East St. Louis, Illinois.  It&rsquo;s part of the United States, its people pay national income taxes to Washington DC, and get welfare benefits from there.  (Much more the latter.)  The mentality that East St. Louis should be formally reunited with and become a province of Nigeria is a &#8220;nut fringe&#8221; mentality among East St. Louis&rsquo;s body of political &#8220;thought.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Obama presidency is in complete free fall due to his utter incompetency and his affinity for central planning. But the narrative in the black community is much different. To the average black in America, Obama is failing because racist whites are sabotaging his presidency. This fantasy is gaining strength in every major urban center across the country. When Obama loses the next election, black flash mobs will turn into a daily form of black insurrection, worse than we witnessed in England recently. In spite of any and all evidence otherwise, blacks will be convinced that Obama got a raw deal in white racist America. The dye is already cast. The violence will be at its absolute worst in liberal enclaves like Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago. It will be bloody. </p>

<p>Los Angeles, July 2011:</p>
<p><i>The flash mob coincided with the Hollywood premiere, at Grauman&rsquo;s Chinese Theater, of &#8216;Electric Daisy Carnival Experience&rsquo;&hellip;LAPD riot police were deployed; bottles and taunts were thrown at the cops, a police cruiser was damaged, and several fights broke out in the crowd. Ultimately, batons and rubber bullets were used to drive the crowd back, and two were arrested on felony vandalism charges.</i> </p>
<p><i>A Tweet from DJ Kaskade at 7:30 described the scene as follows: &#8216;News choppers overhead. The man trying to shut us down&rsquo;&hellip;.</i></p>
<p>You border on some of the roughest black areas in the country  &mdash;   Oakland and Richmond.  It wouldn&rsquo;t take much for those blacks to riot&hellip;and rampage, burn, loot and attack. </p>
<p>We are also under some of the most restrictive gun laws in the nations, especially where you live (except for the hypocritical Diane Feinstein)</p>
<p>April 2011:</p>
<p><i>San Francisco politicians reacted hostilely to the U.S. Supreme Court&rsquo;s rulings affirming that the Second Amendment does protect an individual civil right to keep and bear arms from infringement by any level of government&hellip;.the City has maintained a blanket prohibition on the discharge of firearms  – even in self-defense emergencies&hellip; the City requires that all firearms be stored inoperable in the home so they are useless for immediate self-defense, also a ban on the sale of self-defense ammunition.</i></p>

		<p>black culture is so removed from white culture that even though i grew up around blacks, today i cannot even understand what they are saying. i watched three white people in line in front of me ask the black postal clerk what she was saying to the point where i was embarrased by it. sad but i mean it is totally normal for them also to attack themselves suddenly or start brawling or attacking non blacks with no provocation or over the most trivial things. the end result of this is that they will be living in little tents eating grass and rocks like in africa because lets face it thats what they want</p>

<p>Bon, just to let you know, we expect to win Shall Issue for the entire nation by either 4 July 2012 (if SCOTUS takes a carry case this year), or by 4 July 2013 at latest (either assuming the 4 justices that gave us the Heller and McDonald decisions remain on the Court). </p>
<p>Regardless, we&rsquo;re cleaning up the issuance of CCWs in CA right now and there are two other cases that will really help (Scocca and Rossow). </p>

<p>Thank you for the info. It&rsquo;s been a long, slow slog in California and it&rsquo;s not over yet!  Shame that we have to fight the likes of anti-2A idiot politicians in SF and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Police Chief Beck stated at a buy-back program that his aim was to have ordinary citizens turn in firearms, because they otherwise could get stolen in a burglary. He gloats over the fact that the LAPD &#8216;gun unit&rsquo; was instrumental in ensuring that only 17 gun stores exist in a city of four million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SotYYpPDgw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SotYYpPDgw</a></p>
<p>About that  LAPD &#8220;Gun Unit&#8221; that&hellip;. <i>is at every gun show in So Cal, on every Website having to do with guns, and has served warrants on collectors and gun stores well outside city limits.</i>  THAT unit, with its Gestapo tactics, MUST be dismantled and Chief Beck taught a lesson about 2A rights.</p>
