<h1>Police: No Hate Crimes at State Fair</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nick Iannelli, 620 WTMJ, August 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>West Allis police have released new information on the incident at the Wisconsin State Fair on opening night during which large groups of people caused widespread violence.</p>
<p>The police department issued a statement with details of arrests, saying &#8220;None of these incidents possessed elements that would compel the pursuance of a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; prosecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Witnesses reported attacks on the opening night of the fair that seemed to be racially motivated with young African Americans beating up white fair goers, but police say at this point there is not enough evidence to support such claims.</p>
<p>The report lists only a handful of arrests but there were more than two dozen so the investigation is ongoing.</p>

Wow. So I suppose all those witnesses are lying huh? You hear that white Wisconsin? You&rsquo;re word means nothing and any demand for justice will be met with the same indifference. </p>

		<p>These public sector employees say what they need to in order to keep their jobs and big pensions.  They are so brain-washed it sickens me.  The cops know the real story, they deal with it daily.  One of them will &#8220;talk&#8221;&hellip;mark my words.    </p>
<p>Some red necks here in suburban Detroit made some racial slurs at a black family in a parking lot and it was ALL OVER the local news here as a hate crime.  Yet, blacks beat dozens of whites in flash mobs and &#8220;no hate crime&#8221; LOL  </p>
<p>This is Twilight Zone stuff.   </p>

		<p>Is this what our tax money is paying for, to be lied to in the most blatant way? This simply leads to the police department losing credibility, and once lost it can&rsquo;t be recovered. The politics of lying in it&rsquo;s most transparent form is on display here for all to see. </p>

		<p>It is perhaps unfair to blame the rank and file beat cops. The beat cops are in the middle, between the politicians, rampaging &#8220;Black&#8221; mobs, Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;justice&#8221; system, and the agenda driven judges on the one hand, and the politicized police leadership on the other hand. Most of the beat cops do the best they can, under very trying circumstances. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s where Gov. Scott Walker and Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, both Republicans, the latter being good on immigration, really make names for themselves. </p>
<p>If the P.D. in West Allis don&rsquo;t want to investigate hate crimes riders, then Gov. Walker should order the state highway patrol or state police, whatever it&rsquo;s called, to take over the investigation.  When they find evidence of hate after a long arduous 60 seconds of investigation (&#8220;Reporting so sooooooo hard&#8221;   &mdash;   Unamusement Park), then AG Van Hollen and his office can file the charges, hate crimes riders and handle the prosecution.  Yeah, it&rsquo;s unorthodox, but it&rsquo;s perfectly legal.</p>

		<p>Whew! That&rsquo;s a relief! For a minute I thought blacks were targeting whites in racial attacks in the US and in London.</p>
<p>Luckily, we can trust the authorities because they would never think of lying to us&hellip;</p>

		<p>Young blacks are committing these crimes because they know that they can get away with it, and this police response is both proving that and assisting the next wave.</p>
<p>These are blacks who have grown up watching media the continually denigrates white men, while at school they are taught of the white man&rsquo;s evil.  I doubt that any of these feelings are countered at home by their parents.  They are further emboldened by having a black president who gives them a wink and nod, with his hip hop parties and n***a strut style every time he steps up to the podium.  So they have no reason to think that there is any real harm in getting some kicks attacking some whites here and there, and little chance they will be punished for it.  It&rsquo;s a great time, and the police are afraid of them.</p>
<p>The media here and in Britain continue to black out the truth as much as they can manage.  But they are growing a population that will soon do worse things that we have seen yet in England or here.  Blacks are being groomed to it.</p>

		<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist if you must, but am beginning to suspect that the official tolerance of this flagrant black thuggery has a purpose.  The powers-that-be are simply waiting until a few Whites have finally had enough, and fight back, meeting violence with violence.</p>
<p>And when <i>that</i> happens, the full power of the elites will be unleashed upon this &#8220;epidemic of White racist violence,&#8221; and a wave of unprecedented oppression will descend from on high.</p>
<p>Paranoid?  Maybe.  But if anyone had predicted the current state of affairs in, say, 1975, they&rsquo;d have been called paranoid, too.<br>

<p>I absolutely agree.  Read some history, the Reichstag fire, Walshingham&rsquo;s plots, our own fake Bunker Hill riot that started the revolution.  The brave freedom fighters who took on the English soldiers at Bunker Hill were a well paid and trained rent a mob.  They were unemployed petty criminals who were recruited by Adams, Revere  and other founding Fathers to instigate an incident.  They succeeded.<br>

		<p>This reminds me&hellip;The US Justice Department made a decision and announced it to the public&hellip;.it will no longer consider the question of *civil rights violations* when the victim is white and the perp is *non-white (read: black)&hellip;doesn&rsquo;t that mean the US Justice Dept accepts the *theory* that no black (or persons of color) can be tried or found guilty of hate-crimes (murder being at the top) against a white person because the USJD embraces the Critical Race Theory?  Yes it does&hellip;see Professor Farber&rsquo;s book on Critical Race Theory (in America)&hellip; most interesting&hellip;yes?</p>
