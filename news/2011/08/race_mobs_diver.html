			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrick J. Buchanan, World Net Daily, August 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;ve damaged your own race,&#8221; said Mayor Michael Nutter to the black youths of Philadelphia whose flash mobs have been beating and robbing shoppers in the fashionable district of downtown.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nutter is African-American and the first leader to speak out about the racial character of the flash mobs attacking people in one American city after another. And where are our other leaders?</p>
<p>At the Iowa State Fair last August, black thugs beat a white man so savagely he was hospitalized. Police only began to look into the possibility of a racial attack and hate crime after fair-goers said the thugs were calling it &#8220;Beat Whitey Night.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Memorial Day, Chicago cops had to close a beach when a flash mob formed, attacked people and knocked cyclists off bikes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The media almost never identify the race of the thugs. Their reticence would disappear were a white mob in some Southern city to be caught beating up on black shoppers at a mall.</p>
<p>But the flash mob scourge hitting U.S. cities has been eclipsed by the pillaging and burning of London and other British cities in the worst violence visited on that nation and its capital since Goering&rsquo;s Luftwaffe executed the &#8220;Blitz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands of hoodlums, thugs and criminals have firebombed buildings, looted stores and stripped, beaten and robbed people for no reason other than that they were white.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed cops virtually surrendered the city for three days. By the fourth night, the rampage had taken on a multiethnic caste as Asians and white trash appeared to join in the festival of criminality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A half-century after the long hot summers of the 1960s and two decades after the worst riot in U.S. history since the New York draft riots of 1863  &mdash;  the Los Angeles riot of 1992, in which blacks and Hispanics attacked Koreans and whites  &mdash;  the &#8220;next time&#8221; may have arrived.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} And when the fires burn out, we shall hear anew the old liberal litany about poverty, despair, inequality and unemployment, the excuses that long ago ceased to persuade.</p>
<p>For poverty existed in far greater measure in the Depression. Yet our parents and grandparents did not form mobs to burn, beat and loot.</p>
<p>The West is in decline because the character of its people is in decline. In Europe, Christianity is dead. The moral code it gave men to live righteously is regarded with mockery. The London riots were the work of moral barbarians with no loyalty to the people in whose midst they live and no love for the society to which they give nothing, only take.</p>
<p>In America, millions of fatherless young seek out in gangs the familial ties they never knew. Those gangs are now almost always formed on the basis of ethnicity or race.</p>
<p>What were the British thinking when they threw open their doors to mass immigration from the Third World?</p>
<p>Over centuries, they had failed to assimilate a few million Irish, who were European Christians. So, having failed to assimilate the Irish, they decided to invite in millions of Hindus and Muslims from South Asia, Arabs from the Middle East, Africans from the sub-Sahara, black folks from the Caribbean.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Is multiculturalism a success here? Or does the sudden eruption of flash mobs suggest that the curtain has begun to be pulled back on diversity&rsquo;s dark side here in America?</p>

		<p>For years now many, many people have warned against the concept of multiculturalism only to be denigrated and denounced as a hater or racist by people too inept to have even a modicum of common sense, never mind intelligence.</p>
<p>Well, as many pointed out, arguments against the concept are unnecessary, because pluralism will lead to failure all on its own.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing right now.</p>

<p>The West is in decline because the character of the people has been influenced by the immigrants they have invited in.  Christianity is dead in Europe because more white Europeans are educated and realize the bloody history of Christianity in Europe, and all the civil wars it caused, along with the injustice of persecutions like The Inquisition (which occurred all over Europe, not just Spain), as well as a &#8220;holy crusade&#8221; against Europeans in Southern France in the 13th century. In France, many French an Europeans climb the mountain in Southern France where a castle called Montsegur stands.  It is a national monument to the 244 Cathar &#8220;heretics&#8221; who jumped into a mass pyre rather than convert, and that after a year long military siege.  It is regarded as a spiritual pilgrimage for most Europeans, and I have been there myself.</p>
<p>When I hear the highest of Papal representatives say on national television that no matter how bad things are, there is the afterlife to look forward to, if you believe in Jesus and do all the things commanded, I have no reason to view Christianity with any other attitude than mockery.  </p>
<p>Most Europeans understand the evil of fanatical religion and dogma, but even the secular ones tend to join in the festivals that were once &#8220;pagan&#8221; and carry the cover of Christian titles and slogans.  Mary is just the Mother Goddess and Jesus the newborn spring.  Europeans know this.  Centuries of oppression and persecution couldn&rsquo;t remove it.  That is why Europe will eventually rediscover and reassert itself.  These religions of fear and competition burn themselves out with hate that masquerades as love.  If Europe can just prevent either Islam or Christianity form carrying on their fights for dominance in Europe, Europeans will find the will to fight and extricate non-Europeans from their lands and carry on their cultures and lives, including their unique gifts of art, literature, and inventiveness.  And thereby, the entire world may survive.  Less than this means the collapse of not only Europe, but the world and the entire human population.  That is because you cannot cut of the head of a living thing and see the body survive.</p>

		<p>I almost always agree with Buchanan&rsquo;s analysis of a situation, but does he really believe that just now we&rsquo;re noticing the dark side of &#8220;diversity&#8221;?  Maybe he&rsquo;s just being rhetorical or maybe daring the blinders-on left to actually look behind the curtain. <br>
Even when I lived and worked in big OH cities, I met few blacks who were ghetto types.  But I still knew about the high crime rate among blacks, and I was wary about being in black communities.  I noticed character traits among blacks that made them noticeably different from whites.  <br>
The elitist leftists who want diversity either just want black and brown votes for their political agendas, or they want Western society to collapse  &mdash;  which may be one and the same thing.</p>

		<p>Obviously, the blacks in UK wouldn&rsquo;t be rioting, looting, and destroying private property if the racist SCV in Atlanta would just &#8220;do the right thing&#8221; by taking down those horrifying Confederate flags from over the &#8220;traitors&#8221; graves at Westview Cemetery.</p>
<p>If the flags had been taken down already, in a ceremony pledging the SCV&rsquo;s allegience to the mixed race Dream of MLK, then Brittney Watts woulds still be alive, and the Wisconsin whiteys at the state fair wouldn&rsquo;t have needed their beatings.</p>
<p>If the SCV forces the blacks to spend money on a lawsuit to force the flags to come down, the SCV should be charged with &#8220;hateful harassment and toxic racism&#8221;.</p>
<p><br>

<p><br>
Thursday, Rev. Stellmacher and several more supporters met with Bowen for almost an hour. The group says they no longer find fault with the cemetery, but will take their complaints to Sons of Confederate Veterans and plan to seek legal action in hopes of getting the flag removed.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see White atheists rioting in Iceland. White men are perfectly capable of living righteously without Christianity, it seems to me. This is about race, Mr. Buchanan, not religion. Put these blacks anywhere, give them whatever religion you please, and they will behave in the same way. </p>

		<p>Here we have more (mostly) great and agreeable words from the person of Patrick Joseph Buchanan.  But I was always taught that words are cheap, cheaper than dirt, and that actions were what mattered.  When PJB was forced into an action, he chose Ezola Foster, ahead of thousands and thousands of better qualified white men, to be his running mate.  And he made that choice for one reason and one reason only, affirmative action.</p>

<p>What our Christian friends so often forget is that before during and after Christianity we have always had a tradition of philosophy in the West, starting with the Greeks and going on up to today.  Philosophy has traditionally been called &#8220;natural religion,&#8221; as it was when I took classes at college in 1971.  Aside from that we have Asatru, which tells us that the European has a cultural and even genetic sense of honor.  This is why a lie (broken vow, word) was the worst social trespass in the Viking world, where there was no forgiveness of sin.  Beyond this, it is a matter of survival of a simple tribe to recognize the value of dealing in truth and reliability with your community.  The real function of organized religion has always been to control people and thereby gain political control.  That alone makes it dishonest.</p>

		<p>As ususal, Buchanan dances all around the race issue, occasionally acknowledging glimpses of the truth(albeit in guraded, round-about ways), but never coming out and saying what needs to be said! Come on Pat - what do you have to lose at this point? You are wealthy, successful and, no offesne, not a young man. Come on and say what you KNOW DAMNED WELL is true - speak the truth on race&hellip;and say it with pride and authority!</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t a lack of Christianity for goodness sake - can we please move beyond this anachronistic notion already?!</p>

		<p>&#8220;they had failed to assimilate a few million Irish, who were European Christians&#8221;. For Pat, this will always be the original sin of Anglo-Saxon culture. It comes through in all his writings.<br>
The vast majority of Irish, both New World and Old, are long over it. Not Pat.</p>

		<p>Graduate schools of education continue to teach multiculturalism and diversity as the new religion.  I know because I went back to grad school in my 50&rsquo;s and got a teaching credential and a master&rsquo;s.  We were FORCED to listen to obvious nonsense in class after class.  I only stayed because I wanted a job.  So, yeah, flash mobs are a clear result of multiculturalism in America.  That&rsquo;s what we get for letting these people have their way.  Equal rights was one thing; it needed to happen   &mdash;   but then it went WAY beyond that when they started demanding entitlements due to their victimization by whites.  Schools of education bought that hook, line &amp; sinker   &mdash;   and it&rsquo;s reproduced like third world populations among the well-educated white liberals.  Thanks a lot, you schmucks - now we&rsquo;re going to have to take care of it in a less than pleasant way.</p>

		<p>The other day, I was amazed to read that Prime Minister Cameron is now threatening to give British police a bold new ability- being able to order rioters to remove headgear. That anyone would be so foolish as to have ever prevented in the first place such a basic, simple, and necessary ability of the police speaks volumes about the left.</p>
<p>Fight tooth and nail here to keep the left out of office, at every level of government, every position, everywhere. Its bad in the US, but it can get much worse. If 2% of the population in England are minorities and can cause so much trouble, imagine what the ~30-40% of the population here can do.</p>

<p>PJB is mixed Irish-German ethnicity and while he&rsquo;s Catholic, there&rsquo;s a lot of Protestant in his family.  Ironically, the Irish in his family is Protestant, the Catholic comes from the German side.  So if he is still obsessing over Irish Catholics, it&rsquo;s not a personal axe to grind.</p>

		<p>The best article by far on the London riots was written by the leftist. He points out that the UK ruling elites reserved their hatred for the white working class defending their homes:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/Fa2Yz" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/Fa2Yz</a></p>
<p>(&hellip;)</p>
<p>&#8220;The riots have confirmed, once more, the gaping chasm between Britain&rsquo;s elites and its white working-class natives. In the eyes of our betters and rulers, these whites are the true aliens. Indeed, it is striking that whenever there&rsquo;s a major upheaval these days, the instantaneous response of the high-minded is to ask &lsquo;Oh god, how will the white working classes respond?&rsquo;. After 7/7, the powers-that-be panicked about an &lsquo;Islamophobic backlash&rsquo; among disgruntled whites, posting police outside mosques and encouraging everyone from GPs to teachers to look out for &lsquo;racism and prejudice&rsquo;. Now, following the inner-city riots, all eyes are once again on Those People, the flag-wavers, the beer-drinkers, the people who &lsquo;chant England&rsquo; for Christ&rsquo;s sake, who will possibly turn into a violent vengeful horde. Where some happy-clappy Christians live their lives through the question &lsquo;What Would Jesus Do?&rsquo;, Britain&rsquo;s great and good seem to organise their morality and security around the question &lsquo;What Will The White Working Classes Do?&rsquo;, treating this blob of people as a pogrom-in-the-making who could be provoked into fascistic fury any minute now.&#8221;<br>

<p>I could never understand why he did that! I lost respect for him and his &#8220;honesty&#8221; about race and then have a black woman as his running mate? That sealed his fate right there. He tried to make it look like she is a &#8220;true conservative&#8221; and had the same philosophy as we do. He couldn&rsquo;t have been stupid enough to think he would get the black vote, could he? Why would he even want the black vote?  That&rsquo;s like putting the wolf in the hen house. </p>

		<p>As usual, Buchanan just goes halfway and still doesn&rsquo;t acknowledge the elephant in the room.  The remark about Christianity is absurd; we need to progress beyond the mythology of religion.  He also dances around religion&rsquo;s very dark past.  </p>
<p>For an excellent and true assessment of the riot situation, I recommend Fred Reed&rsquo;s latest column on his website: Racial Worries.  Not only does he hit the nail on the head, but he also sees a very dire future for the US and the UK due to lack of acknowledging the true nature of the problem.</p>

<p>I second your assertion. And I add;  If this is the result of 40+ years and millions, likely billions of dollars being spent to lift up and improve 13% of our population, then we are forced to certain conclusions.  </p>
<p>But we can now sit back and watch the Left profer up the same causes and solutions as they ever have.  What was that about repeating the same action expecting different results?</p>

		<p>I always find Buchanan&rsquo;s analysis informative, accurate, and fair. This article is no different. It communicates the facts without a spin of any kind and makes reasonable assertions regareding them. The Paleoconservatives overall, have provided a good foundation for this modern liberal generation where nothing is bad, immoral, or objective no matter how evil it is. Keep them coming Pat. </p>

I hope the British elites ARE afraid of the white working class  &mdash;  but I doubt it.  I&rsquo;m quite sure that they do hate it, just as American elites do.  Blue-collar folks are usually religious and patriotic.  Most honor tradition and native culture.  They stand in direct opposition to the left&rsquo;s agenda to destroy Western society.  But are they rioting in the streets?  Looting?  Threatening to storm the Bastille as they once did in France?  <br>
Hopefully, they&rsquo;ll storm the polls next election and elect the BNP!</p>

		<p>To anonymous #2, why this diatribe against Christianity?  The deciding factor to date is this, the Christian Nations are the most blessed and successful nations in the world, the heathen nations are trying to emmigrate to these &#8220;evil Christian Nations&#8221; ascribed by you.  Why?</p>
<p>Do you actually believe the heathen tribal nations of this world are more pure, more democratic?  Take a good look around and see where the most brutalized peoples live, and have lived.</p>
<p>Take your anti Christian argument and filter it just a &#8220;tad&#8221;.</p>

		<p>To anonymous and anti-Christianity,</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read such anti-christian hate filled lies in long time. So lets divide them up salami style.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christianity is dead in Europe because more white Europeans are educated&#8221;</p>
<p>The level of education in Europe in terms of quantity is indeed higher. But in terms of quality it is lower. Most of what is called &#8220;education&#8221; today was called &#8220;vocational&#8221; in days past. The level of critical thinking in students is at an all time low. Theodore Roosevelt said: &#8220;If you teach people nothing but skills with no morals, you&rsquo;ve merely made more clever devils.&#8221; This can be seen in the fact that Germany was the &#8220;highest&#8221; educated country in the Euope during the 1920&rsquo;s-1930&rsquo;s but had the highest percentage of communists, socialists, and fascists in the Continent which went on to elect a war-mongering tyrant as its leader. The level of European education has only slid downward since. </p>
<p>&#8221; and realize the bloody history of Christianity in Europe, and all the civil wars it caused, along with the injustice of persecutions like The Inquisition (which occurred all over Europe, not just Spain), as well as a &ldquo;holy crusade&rdquo; against Europeans in Southern France in the 13th century. &#8220;</p>
<p>Interesting that the comparable number of people killed viciously in post-Christian, ideologically secular, and grossly materialist modern Europe brought us the Holocaust, Mass Civilian carpet bombings, biological and chemical warfare, and the virtual indistinguishment of civilian from military targetting. The Inquisition was a Roman Catholic and thus temporal, not spiritual, political institution of enforcement. It had no basis in Christianity, unlike other non-Christian religious institutions ranging from Jews, to Moslems, to Hindus. It was in sum an aberation and did not represent the sum of &#8220;Christianity&#8221;. Yet, even still, comparably, it was much more tolerant than the non-Christian political correct institutions erected by anti-Christian regimes ranging from the Nazis, to the Commies, to the Pinkies now in control of Europe.<br>
 <br>
Given the amount of moral depravity, sexual perversion, materialist obsession, low birth-rates, high STD rates, etc, Europe is in quality of living standards worse off in Post-Christian Europe than in Christian Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;In France, many French an Europeans climb the mountain in Southern France where a castle called Montsegur stands. It is a national monument to the 244 Cathar &ldquo;heretics&rdquo; who jumped into a mass pyre rather than convert, and that after a year long military siege. It is regarded as a spiritual pilgrimage for most Europeans, and I have been there myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Montsegur was not merely a &#8220;Cathar&#8221; e.g. religious citadel. It was in fact, a citadel of nobility, who happend to be a Cathar. Given Mideivel Europe&rsquo;s State organization as a joint Church-Civil affair, your logic would lead to claiming any siege of any castle, as some how religious oriented. False analogy.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I hear the highest of Papal representatives say on national television that no matter how bad things are, there is the afterlife to look forward to, if you believe in Jesus and do all the things commanded, I have no reason to view Christianity with any other attitude than mockery.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really? As someone who cannot see a reality transcendental of your base materialist oriented five senses, you clearly are somewhat stupid. The fact is the life hereafter is now, those who cannot sense it are in fact dull. But, given your stilted state of mind let me put it this way. Groups who believe in the hereafter and a higher power, of a historically proven past of success against groups who believe in nothing superior to themselves. Mujihudeen will win against a Atheideen. </p>
<p>&#8220;Most Europeans understand the evil of fanatical religion and dogma&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But apparently they fail to see how the obliteration of their own fanatical religion as you term it, now makes them exposed to the fanatical religion of others. Sooner rather than later, at current trends, Euorope will be convulsed by the religious fanatics of Islam who will put to the sword seven times seven as many people were killed by the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation and the subsequent Wars of Religious Freedom. They also apparently feel free to forget their own ideological fanaticism, which without a limit owed to divine majesty has murdered far more people as a ratio of population than Christian Europe. </p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;.but even the secular ones tend to join in the festivals that were once &ldquo;pagan&rdquo; and carry the cover of Christian titles and slogans. Mary is just the Mother Goddess and Jesus the newborn spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>You seem to accept non-Christian explanation of the &#8220;other-world&#8221; and yet cannot seem to accept a Christian explanation for the same &#8220;otherworld&#8221;. Perhaps if you weren&rsquo;t dulled by your hate for Christ, you would see that Christ is the new-born spring. Duh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Europeans know this. Centuries of oppression and persecution couldn&rsquo;t remove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>You anti-European revolutionaries are so easy to spot. Ahhh yes, the Marxist-Lenninist tactic of analyzing a target population and revise its history to suit your own agenda. There was no Great Wiccan religion which was squashed by &#8220;The Church.&#8221; Even Julian the Apostate, couldn&rsquo;t organized all the diverse threads of native European shamanistic style religions, Greco-Roman myths, Celtic-German myths, and formulate a codified state religion.  You agenda will similarly fail.</p>
<p>&#8220;These religions of fear and competition burn themselves out with hate that masquerades as love. If Europe can just prevent either Islam or Christianity form carrying on their fights for dominance in Europe, Europeans will find the will to fight and extricate non-Europeans from their lands and carry on their cultures and lives, including their unique gifts of art, literature, and inventiveness. And thereby, the entire world may survive.&#8221; </p>
<p>You claim to support Euorope, but your hate of its religion exposes you as the enemy. Its Christian religion is integral to the art, liteature, customs, and history you claim to support. Lobotomozing it has given Euorope nothing but a century of industrialized warfare more akin to giant meat-grinding murder, architectural and art which is nothing more than the concrete block-headedness of its creators, and explanations as silly as your own. </p>
<p>&#8220;Less than this means the collapse of not only Europe, but the world and the entire human population. That is because you cannot cut of the head of a living thing and see the body survive.&#8221;</p>
<p>European Civilization can only survive if it returns to the salvation offered by Christ as shown in his Gospel of the Bible. A return to that will return temporal and spiritual control to families, integrate them to their localities, and combine their temporal authorities into the nation-states which are the basis of freedom. United in compassion and love of Christ, with common understanding of their civilized ideals and history, Euorpean civlization will return to a more harmonious future which respects nationalism, respects localism, respects differences, and harmonizes them for the General Welfare and Common Defense of them all. Anything less and the grave wound of Europe which started with its abandonment of its soul, will lead to the death of us all.  <br>

		<p>To Anonymous on Natural Religion,</p>
<p>&#8220;What our Christian friends so often forget is that before during and after Christianity we have always had a tradition of philosophy in the West, starting with the Greeks and going on up to today. Philosophy has traditionally been called &ldquo;natural religion,&rdquo; as it was when I took classes at college in 1971.&#8221;</p>
<p>You need to predicate that as so many of our Christian friends. The reality is Christian religious history, the Christian Doctors of the Church, the Reformers, and Evangelists, always recognized That the Europeans had a philosophy of natural religion which was virtuous and ultimately and wholly compatible with the Gospel of Christ. It is remarked throughout Christian history this was nothing less than Divine Providence which made the Europeans and especially the Roman Empire, a perfect chalice for the spreading the redeeming blood of Christ to the people of the world. By not studying this, you are negating what obviously appeared to be a path toward great wisdom you began to take forty years ago. </p>
<p>&#8220;Aside from that we have Asatru, which tells us that the European has a cultural and even genetic sense of honor. This is why a lie (broken vow, word) was the worst social trespass in the Viking world, where there was no forgiveness of sin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asatru and many other similar groups have been carefully constructed by elite groups for purposes of which we still don&rsquo;t know. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t ascribe to their claim of being &#8220;true&#8221; representatives of old European heathen &#8220;natural religion&#8221;. Nonetheless, the idea concerning honor in Nordic society is undeniable. It is also true that breaking it was considered a &#8220;trespass&#8221;. The sin of tresspass, especially if it derived from dishonor could be unforgiven and lead to being outlawed or even executed. Importantly, the Anglo-Saxon Common Law regarding Crime specifically derives from this concept of honor and tresspass. Thus, Asaratu might be useful in helping to understand our concept of the law. But to fully understand, one must understand the role of Christianity.</p>
<p>The divergence of old natural religion holding the sanction of divine retribution via the old heathen rites, occurred with the acceptance of Christianity. That religion mitigated the value of the old heathen rites concerning tresspass and dishonor via the  concept of Christian salvation which stated there was forgiveness of sin. Thus, were the old heathen rites displaced by the Christian religion with its compassion, mercy and love. </p>
<p>Howeve, the taboos, and even law of the old heathen rites remained. But now they were sanctified by the Grace of the philosophy of Christianity. This change allowed for the continued punishment of evil doers by the state authorities via the old heathen law, whilst ameliorating the more barbarious aspects of the law. Thus, punishment of evil doers remained within the context of the state, which was sanctified by Christianity. In other words, the law remained the same, but the Gods who sanctioned it were changed.  This is the birth of Europe as we know it.   </p>
<p>&#8220;The real function of organized religion has always been to control people and thereby gain political control. That alone makes it dishonest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that I&rsquo;ve demonstrated the hold heathen rites of the law were arrived at through the heathen religion, it would be dishonest to support even Asaratu. Or, you could accept that the law is necessary for society to limit the harm of individuals, and only by accepting the law as divinely sanctified can such a law be maintained. Maybe then that would explain why crime by Europeans in its Godless state of development is so rampant today. Either way, religion is Man&rsquo;s way of codifying the natural religion he sees around him. That doesn&rsquo;t make him dishonest, it in fact, keeps him honest.<br>

<p>&#8220;Fight tooth and nail here to keep the left out of office, at every level of government, every position, everywhere. Its bad in the US, but it can get much worse.

<p>Its actually much worse here. What the UK doesn&rsquo;t have, but which we do, or perhaps did have, is space. The fact is, England managed to have large portions of its urban white population living virtually side by side with non-whites with far less trouble than here.

<p>The only choice England has is massive crushing of the non-white communities, including most of their removal and certainly the ending of all non-white immigration, or they must tear up the last of their open spaces and farmlands to create a massive island city of strip malls and suburbs for their white population to flee. Of course that will only last for a while before their falling birthrate numbers combine with increasing non-white numbers, enviornmental degradation and social alienation caused by surburbanization and multiculturalism render the once fair British Isles a hell on earth sometime in the late middle 21st century. </p>
<p>Indeed, perhaps that is who is behind this uprising in the first place? Bloc busting by developers like they did here in American cities during the 60&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s but now on a national scale? Funny, the British government is bringing over a Irish-American Catholic cop to tell them what to do. Hmmmm&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>

<p>BRILLIANT ARTICLE!</p>
<p>This is absolutely true. The elite leadership of both the US and UK are against its own native people. They are in fact an alien elite if not in ethnicity certainly in ideology. This was the same fear that gripped the old Polish-Austro-Hungarian elite and their Jewish managers. Always afraid of the peasant with the pitch-fork who would finally figure out the criminality of their betters and rise up in riteous indignation.  However, the demoralization of the British working and middle classes is such that it is unlikely to rise up anytime soon. Nonetheless the fact that people recognize what is going on suggests there are a growing number of people wising up to the great fraud foisted upon them. Parliament must RESIGN!<br>

<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the premise. Western civilization molded Christianity, not the other way around. The argument is thus: whites don&rsquo;t attribute their core values to Christianity. Democracy in Athens and Rome predates the church, as do our heritage European white values which we still live by, in spite of Christianity.   </p>

		<p>  Make no mistake about it  &mdash;  the privileged British elites fear their own ethnic kinsmen more than they do rampaging black criminal mobs. Look at their stereotypical reaction toward the &#8220;fascists&#8221;, the white working class people defending their homes and shops in Enfield and Eltham.<br>
 <br>
  It is impossible for these deluded elites to even admit that the London riots were started by blacks, let alone that a majority of the rioters were black. No, to them, the blacks rioted in the black areas and the whites rioted in the white areas. It&rsquo;s always been that way throughout British History?<br>
 <br>
  To point out that the blacks, less than six percent of the population, were over fifty percent of the rioters is deemed &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;  Moreover, to note the irrefutable fact that the white &#8220;yobs&#8221; were heavily influenced by a degenerate and pathological black culture, gets you ostracized, fired and labeled a &#8220;racist.&rsquo;  I&rsquo;m afraid even well-meaning and fair-minded liberals like Dr. David Starkey found this out the hard way.  <br>

		<p>If you really want to be angry, have a look at the German online magazine, Spiegel.de. Go to the English section and there is a photo essay and article about the riots. It was a spineless left-wing article about the &#8220;European youth revolt&#8221;, and basically how the rioters are victims. Obviously, most of the rioters were not European. They did make an effort to find a light-skinned righter who appeared white . That of course was the first photo in the slide show. The article was so revolting and offensive, I could not finish it. This is typical of the European media. I believe they are more left wing then ours. You of course cannot leave comments on the Spiegel. German liberals don&rsquo;t like it when you disagree with them.</p>

		<p>im wondering when these looters and mobs will graduate to accosting businesses for more than just a bag of chips and a soda for example are they going to instead enter fast food chains and try to loot the register or get to the safe? i dont see a way for police to stop them. this activity is going to really hurt the economy even worse.  </p>
