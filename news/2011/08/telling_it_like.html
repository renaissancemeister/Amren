<h1>Telling It Like It Wasn&rsquo;t</h1>
 

<p>Ari L. Goldman, The Jewish Week, August 17, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Twenty years ago next week, on the night of Aug. 19, 1991-the night that Gavin Cato and Yankel Rosenbaum were killed-my editor called me at home to tell me that riots had broken out on the streets of Crown Heights. &#8220;We&rsquo;re covered for tonight but I want you to start your day there tomorrow,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Over the next three days, working 12 hours shifts and only going home to sleep, I saw and heard many terrible things. I saw police cars set on fire, stores being looted and people bloodied by Billy clubs, rocks and bottles. One woman told me that she barricaded herself into her apartment and put the mattresses on the windows so her children would not be hurt by flying glass.</p>
<p>Over those three days I also saw journalism go terribly wrong. The city&rsquo;s newspapers, so dedicated to telling both sides of the story in the name of objectivity and balance, often missed what was really going on. Journalists initially framed the story as a &#8220;racial&#8221; conflict and failed to see the anti-Semitism inherent in the riots. As the 20th anniversary of the riots approaches, I find myself re-examining my own role in the coverage and trying to extract some lessons for myself and my profession.</p>
<p>At the time, I was a religion writer at The New York Times and was well connected in the Lubavitch community, the predominant Jewish group in Crown Heights. I was one of probably a dozen Times reporters and photographers on the streets over the course of the riots. {snip}</p>
<p>My job was to file memos to the main &#8220;rewrite&#8221; reporters back in the Times office in Manhattan about what I saw and heard. {snip}</p>
<p>Yet, when I picked up the paper, the article I read was not the story I had reported. I saw headlines that described the riots in terms solely of race. &#8220;Two Deaths Ignite Racial Clash in Tense Brooklyn Neighborhood,&#8221; the Times headline said. And, worse, I read an opening paragraph, what journalists call a &#8220;lead,&#8221; that was simply untrue:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasidim and blacks clashed in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn through the day and into the night yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>In all my reporting during the riots I never saw-or heard of-any violence by Jews against blacks. But the Times was dedicated to this version of events: blacks and Jews clashing amid racial tensions. To show Jewish culpability in the riots, the paper even ran a picture-laughable even at the time-of a chasidic man brandishing an open umbrella before a police officer in riot gear. The caption read: &#8220;A police officer scuffling with a Hasidic man yesterday on President Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was outraged but I held my tongue. {snip}</p>
<p>But then I reached my breaking point. On Aug. 21, as I stood in a group of chasidic men in front of the Lubavitch headquarters, a group of demonstrators were coming down Eastern Parkway. &#8220;Heil Hitler,&#8221; they chanted. &#8220;Death to the Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Suddenly rocks and bottles started to fly toward us and a chasidic man just a few feet away from me was hit in the throat and fell to the ground. Some ran to help the injured man but most of us ran for cover. I ran for a payphone and, my hands shaking with rage, dialed my editor. I spoke in a way that I never had before or since when talking to a boss.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening here!&#8221; I yelled. &#8220;I am on the streets getting attacked. Someone next to me just got hit. I am writing memos and what comes out in the paper? &#8216;Hasidim and blacks clashed&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s not what is happening here. Jews are being attacked! You&rsquo;ve got this story all wrong. All wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t blame the &#8220;rewrite&#8221; reporter. I blamed the editors. It was clear that they had settled on a &#8220;frame&#8221; for the story. The way they saw it, there were two narratives here: the white narrative and the black narrative. And both had equal weight.</p>
<p>After my outburst things got a little better. The next day&rsquo;s report began like this: &#8220;Black youths hurling rocks and bottles scuffled with the police in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn last night, even as Mayor David N. Dinkins tried to personally calm the racially troubled neighborhood after two nights of violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Times still had trouble changing its frame. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The other person who spoke the truth [about the rioting] was the brilliant former executive editor of the Times, A.M. Rosenthal, who by 1991 had become a columnist for the paper. Rosenthal was one of the first journalists at the Times to call the riots what they were. &#8220;Pogrom in Brooklyn,&#8221; was the headline of his column on Sept. 3, 1991, just two weeks after the riots ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;The press,&#8221; Rosenthal wrote, &#8220;treats it all as some kind of cultural clash between a poverty-ridden people fed up with life and a powerful, prosperous and unfortunately peculiar bunch of stuck-up neighbors-very sad of course, but certainly understandable. No-it is an anti-Semitic pogrom and the words should not be left unsaid.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As someone who saw the conflict unfold I can attest to this first-hand. I am telling my story in print for the first time because it is important that we journalists examine our mistakes and learn from them. Fitting stories into frames-whether about blacks and Jews, liberals or conservatives, Arabs and Israelis, Catholics and Protestants or Muslims and Jews-is wrong and even dangerous. Life is more complicated than that. And so is journalism.</p>
