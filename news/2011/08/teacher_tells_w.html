<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Is there ever a worthy explanation as to why a teacher would help her students cheat on a test?</p>
<p>According to a veteran Philadelphia teacher, yes, there is.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted them to succeed, because I believe their continued failure on these terrible tests crushes their spirit,&#8221; the unidentified teacher told the Notebook.org, a Philadelphia Public School site that serves as an independent voice for parents, educators and students. The teacher says she regularly provided assistance including definitions to unfamiliar words, comments on writing samples during tests, and says that she even discussed reading passages that they didn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a city made up of 43.2 percent Blacks and with the possibility of schools being shut down and teachers losing their jobs, she says cheating was &#8220;widespread&#8221; and &#8220;constant&#8221; amongst almost all of her students who were &#8220;poor and African-American.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Math teachers were sitting down in the seat next to the children, with a pencil, actually working out problems with them. I saw that many times,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past two years, 22 states and the District of Columbia have had confirmed cases of cheating. In July,BET.com reported that almost 80 percent of the schools in Atlanta falsified responses on the state&rsquo;s standardized test.</p>

		<p>She has a point. I can&rsquo;t imagine how disheartening it must be for black children and black parents to be told over and over again that their children should be achieving on the same level as white and Asian children, and then to be confronted head on with a reality that is quite different. I&rsquo;m sure in their heart of hearts, no one knows better than blacks themselves how empty the  rhetoric is. Sometimes honesty is the best policy, even if the truth hurts. </p>
<p>By setting them up for failure, you make it seem like it is their fault that they aren&rsquo;t very good at math and other subjects. It may not be their fault at all. It may simply be a biological reality that it would be a great relief for all involved to finally, honestly face. </p>

		<p> WOW! Just when you think the black culture couldn&rsquo;t get any worse. There is no morality, no sense of right and wrong. Blacks feel that whatever they do to get what they want is justified. There is an article on Drudge about the parents rallying for the cheating teachers ugh!</p>
<p>  I lived in Europe for a while and became familiar with gypsies. A race of people built on fraud and dishonesty. You can never trust a gypsy. I&rsquo;m sure many here know what Im talking about. It is looking like American blacks are just like gypsies   only violent.<br>

		<p>Many blacks believe in magic.  If they are handed a diploma or a degree, they will be magically enabled to be as smart and capable as white people.  Other, less superstitious blacks believe diplomas and degrees are civil rights.  And, if they don&rsquo;t receive these symbols of accomplishment, it&rsquo;s because whitey is withholding them because of racism.  They don&rsquo;t believe they should have to study or attend class to receive them.  And, when they receive their government or private-sector Affirmative Action job, they shouldn&rsquo;t have to perform any duties or even show up if they don&rsquo;t want to.  They should be given an upscale apartment or house, a fancy car, and a white mate.  <br>
And some people wonder why blacks who had no job and no income thought mortgage payments wouldn&rsquo;t have to be made?</p>

		<p>If you want to know why all the cheating, here it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnqQhUdXgvI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnqQhUdXgvI</a></p>
<p>Understand something, the grain of truth within this South Park clip is not the reason for the cheating.  The tremendous lie planted in the grain of truth, that widespread cheating is responsible for white success and that non-whites should simply copy that behavior, is the cause.</p>
<p>This is a carefully crafted bit of propaganda, blasted 24/7 from various media.  It&rsquo;s a subset of a great number of lies, rooted in nazi and soviet techniques (note the failure of both movements for different reasons&hellip;.very important&hellip;this way of thinking lead to dramatic failure) that the truth is the truth based on what is useful, not based on what is actual.</p>
<p>Literally, blacks are being brainwashed to pass the test, then fail at life (and blame whitey for the failure).  Who is doing the brainwashing is an important question.  One that is taboo to ask.  When its no longer taboo, especially when it is decriminalized in certain white countries, there will be a third world war.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I wanted them to succeed, because I believe their continued failure on these terrible tests crushes their spirit,&rdquo;  So noble.  What happens when they can&rsquo;t get into college or get a job?  What about their spirits then?  Or when they can&rsquo;t pass a simple civil service exam, huh?  This liberal sympathetic teacher is actually doing them a disservice so she can feel good about herself.  Never mind that she instills false hopes into her students.  And what about the teacher next door who doesn&rsquo;t cheat?  That teacher will be brought on the carpet as to why his class did so poorly.  There won&rsquo;t be an independent investigation looking at the other perspective as to how did these students do so well that maybe there was some nefarious activity going on.  And what about those students who received no help on these tests.  They are now at a disadvantage.  </p>
<p>This teacher is a fake, phony, and a fraud.  For her own self esteem to help a few and make herself look good she has done countless harm to many others.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight. She wants to see them succeed so she helps them cheat? What kind of logic is that? She also claims their continued failure to pass these tests crushes their spirit? HA! I&rsquo;ll bet most of them couldn&rsquo;t care less about these tests. Wasn&rsquo;t it even reported that some even slept through the tests? Why would they care? They know the government will provide for them just like every generation before them. </p>

<p>RESOLVED: Testing is NOT how we should hold our government monopoly school systems accountable, certainly not our urban government monopoly systems.</p>
<p>Testing was going to be the panacea, a way to keep these government monopolies on their toes, so to speak. Independent testing, testing by an outside source, might have served this purpose, but it would have been prohibitively expensive and it would have revealed a depressing reality that the politicians who control government schooling could not afford to publicize. </p>

		<p>Ok, so&hellip;</p>
<p>Even with widespread cheating, scores for blacks are still pathetic.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>How many cheat their way to a &#8220;barely skimming by&#8221; level, then get into something resembling a college where they barely skim by with help from those who wish to prove everybody&rsquo;s all the same.</p>
<p>Then&hellip;</p>
<p>End up being hired by diversity seeking entities, like state and federal governments, based on their bogus academic &#8220;achievements&#8221;, </p>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<p>Thereby drag the entire society down as a direct result of their incompetence.</p>
<p>Unfortunate we must sacrifice a functional government by being forced to use it as a dumping ground for incompetent, sham educated, sometimes borderline retarded members of supposedly discriminated against &#8220;minorities&#8221;.</p>

		<p>In Maryland, we have the High School Assessments (HSAs), starting in 9th grade with Algebra, 10th grade with English, etc. Biology and American Government are the other subjects. These students get numerous chances to pass them. They are given 2X per year during day school, and again, in the evening. If they can&rsquo;t pass the multiple-choice on-line exams, they are given the opportunity to do a &#8220;Bridge Plan&#8221;  &mdash;  where a teacher from the subject area will sit with them while they do it. The teacher is &#8220;allowed&#8221; to &#8220;show&#8221; them examples, as long as the student does the &#8220;actual&#8221; &#8220;problem&#8221; himself or herself. (Sorry for the quotation marks   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re there for a &#8220;reason&#8221;.) </p>
<p>Students have an incredibly hard time failing these tests. But they manage to fail them anyway. What to do, what to do&hellip;</p>

		<p>The evidence just keeps mounting for the advisability of segregating schools.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even blacks want it that way.</p>
<p>Though because of cultural differences and the disparate distribution of gray matter &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; is an unrealistic expectation, segregation is a practical response to the simple facts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time our society stopped hiding from the truth:</p>
<p>No Child Left Behind = impeded progress for the majority of students, and fraudulent advancement of those less gifted.</p>
<p>Let black schools teach Afro-centrism to prepare their students for lucrative futures as government employees and &#8220;diversity consultants!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I doubt that many black students care about how badly they do on the tests. They think performing well is acting white. They have never heard of Charles Murray and J. Philippe Rushton, but they knew instinctively that what those men say about them is true.<br>
 <br>
They do not care because they take pride in other things, like who can sass the teacher with the most wit. </p>

<p>That sums up Affirmative Action and the modern coddling of blacks in general.  Give them everything, or they might feel bad!  &#8220;Success&#8221; has nothing to do with actual performance, because only self esteem counts.  </p>

		<p>I think what that teacher quoted above said is a lie.  Teachers - AND ADMINISTRATORS - cheat because if they don&rsquo;t, THEY WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS.  Period, end of report.  I watched it happen here in SoCA and I have absolutely no reason to believe it&rsquo;s any different anywhere else.  I was in a Mexican barrio school, but it&rsquo;s the same thing.  The kids fail regardless of what you do, so you have to end up helping YOURSELF instead of them.  It&rsquo;s pure survival.</p>

<i>&ldquo;I wanted them to succeed, because I believe their continued failure on these terrible tests crushes their spirit,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I agree with post 15. This statement sums it up.</p>
<p>These people have no understanding that tests are used to determine how well a teacher teaches and how well a student learns. They ARE NOT designed for the purpose of crushing the spirits of young children.</p>
<p>Blacks are beyond hope. It&rsquo;s a waste of time trying to help them when they can&rsquo;t understand BASIC principles of education which includes assessments based on tests.</p>
<p>Tests are not terrible. Tests are not designed to crush spirits. Tests are nothing more than a tool to assess learning skills.</p>

		<p>As in South Africa where after Apartheid finished and the new terrorist government took over, black students rioted with slogans like &#8220;Pass one. pass all&#8221; demanding pass certificates/degrees for just attending courses. not having to actually pass them.  But all this has done is devalue all degrees held by South African students especially the black ones and as in the USA, affirmative action has proven that giving degrees etc to those who are not worthy of them ruins a country in quite a short space of time.  No one with any sense will hire a black student with potentially fraudulent certificates</p>
<p>My father was a poor man who had his education interrupted in the early 20th Century when as a child he caught polio.  But my brother and I, now retired and in our 70s were made to study and work hard when at school by our poor parents, and we have both done very well with the enforced good work ethic helping us all the time.<br>
Poverty should be a spur to work hard tro earn not a reason to condone cheating which will remain in the person&rsquo;s psyche and work ethic for life.</p>

		<p>If say, these cheaters turned out to be 10% more prevelent among white students, or even if whites were only 1% more likely to cheat, wouldn&rsquo;t this be a national scandal, because of the unfair advantage gained by white students? Wouldn&rsquo;t the bean-counting never end? Even if it was only a Possibility whites were gaining an advantage due to this &#8216;cheating&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t the hand wringing about oppression, and calls for redistribution and correction, never end? </p>
<p>Admittedly BET examines a racial angle, but not once is the idea expressed this could be unfair towards whites or other students, if indeed african americans are more likely to cheat. Are we saying all of them got caught, and none anywhere got away with it?</p>

<p>And by THIRD grade these black kids ALL know what the score is, so to speak. That they are incapable of doing the work and more or less just give up. It has been noted over and over that say for the black kids of kindergarten, 1st and 2nd grade age, the kids are all full of energy, answering questions, peppy, ready to learn, etc. By third grade a malaise has set in, the black kids go into a stupor and just sit there depressed about the whole thing. Maybe what has occurred - - and no one wants to admit it, is that these kids have come to the obvious realization that they are in a situation that is just beyond them and their abilities and they KNOW it. Even at such an early age.</p>

		<p>There are many issues afoot in this scandal.  One is, of course, the cheating by teachers to keep their jobs  &mdash;  something a pre-school child would think of doing but apparently not something that occurred to George W. Bush and his advisors when No Child Left Behind was formulated.  The idea was then continued by Obama with his Race to the Top (any double meanings here?)  <br>
Then there&rsquo;s the issue of continued black failure.  It&rsquo;s not due to unconcerned parents or fears of acting white.  It&rsquo;s because a large percentage of blacks are not even moderately intelligent.  </p>

Watch the white teacher side-step the question when asked if blacks are not as smart as white. He answers, &#8220;come on, I&rsquo;m a teacher&#8221; &hellip;or something like that. </p>

		<p>Anonymous- I usually agree with you but in this case I really do not think that in &#8220;their heart of hearts&#8221; that blacks know how empty their rhetoric is. I believe that most of them really do think that they have achieved something positive when a grade is<br>
tweaked for their little egos. They actually buy into their idiocy<br>
and then take it into their adult lives. <br>
The number of blacks now taking the forefront (statistics be damned) in commercials as being the go to person, the CEO, the straight man is so blatant and obvious now. </p>

		<p>#2_anonymous has a valid point. They are expected to perform at the same level as Whites and Asians. Does anyone expect Whites and Asians to play basketball as well as blacks, who have a biological sprinting and jumping advantage? Blacks should be able to attend blacks-only schools wherein they focus on their strengths. Diversity hurts blacks, by forcing them to compete wih Whites. Why they ever wanted to integrate schools is the question, did they really think blacks would perform better in a school with White classmates? In elementary public school, I was told about &#8220;seperate but equal&#8221; schools, and when the teacher said that the black schools were not equal to White schools ( ostensibly because white schools wouldn&rsquo;t let them be), I wondered why blacks did not just build themselves better schools.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a teacher in a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; urban school.  If we did not &#8216;help&rsquo; them along, most of them would pass nothing and we would lose our jobs.  It&rsquo;s as simple as that.  (Did you know that students only need to pass about 34% of any given state test to &#8216;pass&rsquo; it with a &#8216;65&rsquo;?  And still half our students fail!)  </p>
<p>I always try to stay on the up-and-up myself, but most of my fellow teachers are not as strong as I (nor can they survive economically if they lost their jobs, unlike me who built an impressive &#8216;plan B&rsquo; realizing that there is no future in education).  </p>
<p>The ones who blatantly cheat on behalf on the students the most are usually the younger &#8216;social justice&rsquo; white liberal teachers.  It&rsquo;s sad to see them at the moment when they realize all their &#8216;superman&rsquo; antics change nothing.  It takes about 1.5 years for them to reach this point.  </p>
<p>The perfect storm hits - of realizing their admins are affirmative action dolts or liberal head-in-the-sand parrots, their students would rather gang-bang and hoochie around than study, the reality of the immovable low I.Q. barrier, and the understanding that if they stop working 50+ extra free hours a week then their admin will low rate them and replace them with a fresh &#8216;newbie&rsquo; who will come in with the idealism afresh.  They try cheating to help the students, but the risks and the outcomes are just too much to bear.</p>
<p>Oh to see the let down in their minds as it translates to their sullen faces!  Then they silently become race realists, even as they parrot the party line, though ever more weakly.  If they make it past three years, they are jaded and go through the motions. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a farce, and we are but actors on a stage&hellip;<br>

Those that do want those rewards may think of them as voodoo magic talismans that make ppl smart, and that Whitey is only powerful and smart because of hording all the talismans. Black males that desire White women do so because they want to siphon the &#8220;magic&#8221; from the White genepool, for they chillins, thereby evolving their bloodline (simultaneously desiring to stick a knife into the back of white men).</p>

<p><i>There is an article on Drudge about the parents rallying for the cheating teachers ugh!</i></p>
<p>LoL, don&rsquo;t act so surprised Captain!!</p>
<p>I called up that article right after I read your post and expected to read exactly what was in the article, as cheating is acceptable in the black community.  Here are the highlights (well, lowlights, actually):</p>
<p><i>a parade of parents defended a school where the principal has been asked to resign because of the scandal surrounding the 2009 Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests.</i></p>
<p><i>On a small stretch of sidewalk outside the district&rsquo;s headquarters in downtown Atlanta, participants sang songs and offered prayers on behalf of the leadership, teachers and children in Atlanta Public Schools.</i></p>
<p>What are the chances of ANY of the (black) teachers or administrators being terminated??  How about ZERO!!  They may not only receive their positions back but back pay as well and possibly a settlement for pain and suffering.  I expect they&rsquo;ll be on the black talk show circuit as well.</p>
<p>The Atlanta school district is even paying the legal bills for former superintendent  Beverly Hall. </p>
<p><i>the legal bills of former Atlanta schools superintendent Beverly Hall, as they relate to the district&rsquo;s ongoing cheating scandal, have cost APS more than $53,000 so far</i></p>
<p>Cheating is <i>rampant</i> in my school district!  RAMPANT and PERVASIVE (and, as I explained in an earlier post, even encouraged as we were told in a teachers&rsquo; meeting NOT to erase student answers as ETS computers flag answer sheets with  &#8220;abnormal&#8221; numbers of erasures and pulls them for a closer look, the inference being if you&rsquo;re going to cheat on the tests, find another way besides erasing student answers!!  Guess Atlanta didn&rsquo;t get the same memo we did in LA!!).</p>
<p>Here is a typical example, as told to me by a retiring colleague who&rsquo;d &#8220;had enough.&#8221; </p>
<p>Every student must now pass an &#8220;exit exam&#8221; to receive a high school diploma in California (called the CaHSEE).  The final test for 12th graders is given ~ March (these are 12th graders that are taking the test for the fourth, fifth sixth time, rumor has it that the test gets EASIER toward graduation).  A black student&rsquo;s test at this colleague&rsquo;s school was flagged by the school before being sent to ETS for scoring   &mdash;   his answer sheet had all of the correct answers except for a different version of the test!!  (there are several versions of the test, usually we receive all of the same version to make it easier for students to copy, I believe).  My colleague didn&rsquo;t know the details after that but needless to say, the black student walked the stage in June and received a diploma.  </p>
<p>This colleague also told me that he entered one classroom during testing and saw answers to the test written on the board   &mdash;   he walked right out and was told later by the teacher and two teacher/proctors that were in the room that this is how it&rsquo;s always been done.</p>
<p>AND, why employers give their own tests now as a condition for employment.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
<i>Blacks are beyond hope. It&rsquo;s a waste of time trying to help them when they can&rsquo;t understand BASIC principles of education which includes assessments based on tests.</i></p>

		<p>This is easily one of the most ridiculous things I have ever read related to dysfunctional black behavior - and we&rsquo;ve all come across countless examples of dimwitted black stupidity.</p>
<p>This violates every civilized, educational, and ethical approach to teaching and benefits absolutely no one.</p>
<p>Worse, it confirms the fact that blacks are intellectually inferior - although further confirmation is really not required.</p>
<p>First, by having students unable to perform on tests, the teacher admits that she is a failure (unable to teach). The next question arises - how did the teacher pass her tests?</p>
<p>Next, it tells the students that any future exams are both futile and of no consequence - so whatever shred of incentive to work harder is lost. Despite what the teacher believes, and however dumbed down the system becomes, these students will be asked to take exams throughout the years for any number of reasons - it just allows them to give up, become angry, and grow convinced that whitey is out to get them.</p>
<p>I like how the teacher demonizes the &#8220;terrible tests&#8221; as if that is the problem. No, the problem rests with the test takers.</p>
<p>Instead, the teacher (and her cheating cronies) should stop wrapping their little minds into pretzels with trumped-up justifications and come clean.</p>
<p>1. Blacks generally cannot pass the exams because they do not have the inherent capacity to do so.</p>
<p>2. Accordingly, separate the students and provide a basic curriculum of limited academic content to blacks and concentrate on vocational skills along with behavioral discipline training.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this will only get worse. <br>

<p>Philly Student Test Scores Up Again</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA - The embattled Philadelphia School District is getting some good news in the form of student test scores.</p>
<p>Standardized tests scores for Philadelphia students have gone up for the ninth straight year.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s good news for the city and the surrounding area because better students make Philadelphia more attractive to businesses looking to move here.</p>
<p>But is the news good enough to take some pressure off of superintendent Arlene Ackerman? That remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The standardized tests given to students in 3rd through 8th and 11th graders came back with modest increases.</p>
<p>Philadelphia students saw increases in both categories. Math scores are up 2.7 percent. Reading scores are up 2.3 percent.</p>
<p>The gains are even bigger when you look one of the district&rsquo;s key initiatives: the first year of six Promise Academies.</p>
<p>These revamped low performing schools saw a 10-percent increase in math scores and nearly a 6-percent jump in reading.</p>
<p>The district says it&rsquo;s proud of the scores and that they&rsquo;re heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>But look deeper into the numbers, and still nearly 45 percent of students are not up to state standards.</p>
<p>And there are still achievement gaps with minority students.</p>

<p>The reason Whites aren&rsquo;t working in these jobs is because for the most part they are PUSHED out BY the &#8220;hispanics&#8221; themselves. They will speak only in Spanish and intimidate and bully, yes BULLY, and THREATEN any White kid that has the misfortune to work around these ingrates. The same goes for ag workers. Their contractor is ALWAYS a Mexican who hires ONLY Mexicans, mainly illegals, and will NOT hire any other race, especially a White. This is a FACT! There was a report on this very thing not long ago where I live. A White ex-contractor went undercover taking his 18 year old son with him to apply for work in the fields. He recorded it all. We all know they pay cheap wages that the rest of us could never live on and pay our rent. But with the mexicans and illegals they get &#8220;other&#8221; money on the side, (welfare, drugs, crime, ssa, etc.) They use fake documents and most are never investigated to begin with&hellip;That would be racist, you see.</p>

		<p>As sidebar to this topic, I note that over the last four decades in public schools, on the part of students, there has steadily been less and less  indicatiion of internalized disdain or aversion toward cheating.  There has been, in fact, more and more of a &#8220;prudence morality&#8221; by which &#8220;doing what you can get away with&#8221; has been more and more embraced and given an unvoiced wink-and-smile approval by peer groups.  As with many problems that we would hope to find to be isolated difficulties, this problem, too, is but a part of the overall cultural meltdown/melding.  </p>
