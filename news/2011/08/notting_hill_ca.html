<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14706924">Notting Hill Carnival: Police Hail &#8216;Peaceful&rsquo; Event</a></h1>
 

<p>BBC News, August 30, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>The Notting Hill Carnival has been peaceful, police say, with 245 arrests in total during the two-day event.</p>
<p>Officers are investigating the stabbing of a 20-year-old man near the parade route in west London on Monday.</p>
<p>He is said to be in a serious condition in hospital. Five people-a boy aged 16, three 20-year-old men and a man aged 21-were held over the attack.</p>
<p>More than one million people were expected to attend the carnival, billed as Europe&rsquo;s biggest street festival.</p>
<p>The festivities drew to a close 90 minutes earlier than last year, at 19:00 BST and there were more than 6,500 police officers on duty.</p>
<p>The annual two-day celebration of Caribbean culture sees parades of colourful costumes and floats run along a procession route from Ladbroke Grove to Westbourne Grove and Chepstow Road, along with about 40 sound systems.</p>
<p>One carnivalgoer told the BBC: &#8220;The police have been fantastic today, there&rsquo;s people from all over the world here representing the carnival and we&rsquo;re having a good time despite the London riots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said: &#8220;It&rsquo;s absolutely fantastic, I love Carnival, bring on 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Outstanding support&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor of London with responsibility for policing, said carnivalgoers recognised what was at stake after the London riots.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year a lot of the floats were on earlier, there was obviously a much bigger policing presence, you can sense a change in the atmosphere from previous years, in that people are kind of on their best behaviour because they know the world is watching,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tim Godwin, the Metropolitan (Met) Police&rsquo;s acting commissioner, said carnival organisers, float drivers and band leaders had all come together and the &#8220;support for the police from the committee has been outstanding&#8221;.</p>
<p>London Ambulance Service said 241 people were treated at the event, with 27 taken to hospital.</p>
<p>There were two more arrests than last year, when 243 people were detained.</p>
<p>Those held at the weekend were suspected of a variety of offences including drugs possession, public order, theft, criminal damage, robbery and assault, the Met said.</p>
<p>Officers used automatic number plate recognition outside of the carnival area to target potential troublemakers and preventing them from getting to the event.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;True spirit&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>The stabbing happened at about 18:00 BST in Ladbroke Grove and officers said the man was found with possible stab wounds to the abdomen and hand.</p>
<p>At 19:30 BST an area outside a three-storey block of flats on Ladbroke Grove, close to the junction with Kensal Road, was cordoned off after a person suffered serious injuries.</p>
<p>A Met officer said it was believed an object was thrown from a flat window and hit the person on the pavement below.</p>
<p>Met Commander Steve Rodhouse said: &#8220;Through effective stop and search we believe we have deterred and prevented trouble from taking place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will make sure that our officers are out stopping the right people.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 70 tonnes of waste was cleared by 170 cleaners and 60 vehicles over three hours on Monday night, Westminster Council said.</p>
