<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=329513">The Truth About Violent Flash Mobs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Bennett, World Net Daily, August 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Our conversation about race is suffering from a terrible abuse of the English language. As a result, we are not addressing racial mob violence. {snip}</p>
<p>Everybody knows that not all black teens attack in flash mobs. There is no one in a position of prominence in society who would say or mean that. When someone says &#8220;Black teens have been attacking in flash mobs,&#8221; we should know what they mean  &mdash;  that the people who attack in flash mobs have been black.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in articles and radio interviews, I&rsquo;ve pointed out the simple fact that black teens have been attacking in flash mobs. A common response to my factual observation is that &#8220;Not all blacks are that way,&#8221; or &#8220;You can&rsquo;t generalize.&#8221; But I&rsquo;ve never stated or implied that all blacks are that way, or made any generalizations. Our conversation about race is stuck in this bizarre cycle where someone makes an observation about group behavior, and the only response from many people is a clich√© like &#8220;Don&rsquo;t judge entire groups.&#8221; It&rsquo;s as if the plain meaning of words becomes clouded when we pass into the forbidden topic of race. Many are playing word games to evade the stark facts about racial mob violence.</p>
<p>While the shooting death of a young gay man named Lawrence King makes the cover of Newsweek magazine, an equally harmful type of hateful violence has been underreported. Anna Taylor, Emily Guendelsberger and Thomas Fitzgerald of Philadelphia all suffered in separate, violent &#8220;flash mob&#8221; attacks, committed by blacks. The details of their attacks are shocking; the trend is to pick a random pedestrian, punch them and then kick them brutally while they are down. Whether it&rsquo;s the shooting death of Andrew Graham in Denver, or a young white lady named Shaina Perry being taunted and beaten in Milwaukee, or Carter Strange having his skull fractured in Columbia, S.C., or Dawid Strucinski beaten into a coma in Bayonne, the facts are clear: There is a trend of black teens in groups randomly attacking innocent people, usually non-black people. It&rsquo;s not about robbery; sometimes these attacks are just vicious &#8220;games&#8221; like the &#8220;knock out game&#8221; that took the life of 72-year-old Hoang Nguyen in St. Louis. The victims of these attacks, nationwide, are generally non-black, and the attackers are invariably black. What we are seeing is a social problem with a racial element, and it needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Of course, black <em>race</em> is not the cause of the problem; the distinct culture of the black teen attackers is the cause of the problem. That culture in turn arises from the unique constellation of mores, habits, attitudes, family structure and government dependence found within a segment of the black community. Those factors have nothing to do with biology, or genetics, or &#8220;all black people.&#8221; These qualifications wouldn&rsquo;t even be necessary in a society where people were prepared to face facts and be honest about social issues. Instead, our conversation about race breaks down, and the core social problem is lost in accusations about &#8220;broad brushes&#8221; and generalizations.</p>
<p>No one who matters is actually making remarks about entire groups. What people are doing is making observations about group behavior and race: that black teens have been attacking in flash mobs. Based on that factual observation, my interpretation is that there is an emerging social problem, made worse by double standards about race in our society. {snip}</p>

		<p>As Bill put it two days ago about the flash mobs in Philadelphia,<br>
there is a &#8220;nationwide low level black guerilla war&#8221; currently taking place against whites in this country. The outrage is totally absent on the part of the complicit media as well as the<br>
so-called Christian leaders in black communities.</p>

		<p>All this abstract hand wringing and jibber jabber.</p>
<p>The absolute first thing that should be discussed is the &#8220;What If&#8221; test.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if&#8221; these flash mobs were whites attacking blacks?  </p>
<p>What would the media response be?  Not to mention the politicians?  </p>
<p>They would instantly connect the dots and draw conclusions about the RACISM involved in these horrible attacks. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny; to eliminate the racial sting, the media coverage always seems to feature black reporters and black police officers condemning the horrible behavior by these &#8220;troubled youth&#8221; and &#8220;troubled teens&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t seen coverage of so many of these incidents, I would have never believed they could be covered in such a ridiculous manner.</p>
<p>This is a national scourge that is sweeping the country and everybody is afraid to state the obvious   &mdash;  - especially the politicians.</p>

<p>What a pathetic disclaimer. The question is, <i>why</i> does black culture so often turn out this way? </p>
<p>More to the point, the moment you make such a rationalization, you open the door to liberal excuse-mongering and claims that this culture is due to white &#8220;racism&#8221; and &#8220;oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the very least, turn the argument against the liberals and blame it on constant liberal screams of &#8220;societal racism&#8221; which causes a bubbling over of black resentment toward white people. That&rsquo;s still not the correct explanation, of course, but at least it puts liberals on the defensive.</p>
<p>On second thought, why not just tell the truth?</p>

		<p>I strongly disagree with this article.  It concludes by saying that genetics and race have nothing to do with it, the problems are all cultural.  That doesn&rsquo;t wash.  IQ, aggressiveness and propensity for violence most certainly are genetic and most certainly are not randomly and evenly distributed without regard to race.  Yes black culture and government dependence are also problems but I would say that hyper-masculine black culture is a byproduct of hyper-masculine black genetics.  Why did Chinese calligraphy start in China 3,000 years ago and not in Africa 3,000 years ago?  Why did we have astronomy and mathematics in the white Middle East 3,000 years ago and not in black Africa?</p>

		<p>Before people get too deragatory by the qualifier at the end of the article, remember black crime rates were much lower when black culture was more traditional (think the 50s).  </p>
<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t undervalue the cultural changes that can occur to improve the abhorrent behavior among the &#8220;youths.&#8221;  When the &#8220;youths&#8221; had a father, a religious upbringing, and a subculture that strongly rebuked this type of behavior instead of one promoting it  &mdash;  a more peaceful Afro population existed.</p>
<p>Yes, genetics matter, in fact quite a bit.  But so too does culture.  The 2011 Flash Mobs have occured due to a compounding effect that the Great Society no doubt helped foster.</p>

		<p>The real issue with black mob violence is what happens when guns are inevitably used in self defense to kill a large number of them.</p>
<p>Has this already happened and the media is covering it up?  I think it overwhelmingly likely.</p>
<p>Such incidents will herald the complete conversion of race war from a &#8220;dirty war&#8221; where everyone pretends its crime (but a significant minority know the truth and many more arm themselves) to overt war&hellip;..even all out war.</p>

		<p>I was watching one of those crime shows on TV and a white mother on the show says something like, &#8216;they have a different culture&rsquo;. According to the take of the show, This was the most racist attitude to have. So basically, if you&rsquo;re white, you&rsquo;re a racist no matter what you think. If I have it right, you&rsquo;re a racist unless you blame everything wrong on this Earth on whites and do so with a proper enthusiasm. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amusing watchig the national and local pundits avoid the races of the perps and victims. This will become racial once these &#8220;brave&#8221; souls pick the wrong white guy and he litters the street with dead ghetto trash. Sure, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC and other affiliates will somehow manage to make whites as the bad guys and blacks as the ultimate victims. </p>

<p>When Levi Aron was arrested for murdering Leiby Kletzky they didn&rsquo;t need a disclaimer staring that we mustn&rsquo;t blame all Jews for murdering children.  Why no disclaimer there?  But they need a disclainer when talking about black crime. Could it be that blacks are so violent as a group that the press MUST remind us that not all blacks are violent.  I might forget that not all blacks are violent if they didn&rsquo;t remind whereas I don&rsquo;t look at all Jewish men as child murders. Hmmmmm.</p>

		<p>Sites like WND serve a purpose, like an intellectual halfway house where people who suspect what the truth is, but are afraid to face it head on, can dip their toes into the cold waters of reality. AmRen is a site for people who have already resolved their philosophical issues. I have referred many friends to AmRen and similar sites, and most find them too disturbing.

		<p>This was snipped from the article:</p>
<p>&gt;i&gt;Everybody knows that not every American likes football. So when we hear someone say, &#8220;Americans like football,&#8221; we understand that they mean that the people who like football are generally American.</p>
<p>Actually, where I live (Berkeley, Ca.), I think any statements such as, &#8220;Americans like football,&#8221; would often elicit the response, &#8220;Not all Americans do,&#8221; since the prohibition against using language that can be construed to characterize a group is so strong.</p>
<p>Certainly ethnic groups must never be characterized in any way, and the moral stigma of doing so now attaches to characterizing any group.</p>
<p>White people have been taught not to think in terms of groups, and have been taught to constantly reinforce that training by intoning, &#8220;Not all ____ do,&#8221; so that they may never come to the dangerous realization that they themselves are a group.</p>

		<p>I agree with anonymous #6. I&rsquo;d like to add that, to the extent that this phenomenon DOES have environmental components, the blame can be laid at the feet of the leftist establishment.  The modern black thug is largely the creation of leftists.  Leftist schools and media constantly drum into their heads how &#8220;evil&#8221; the white man has been to them, how they suffered for &#8220;400 years&#8221;, how the white man enslaved them, how the white man keeps them down etc.</p>
<p>Even if their genes were the same as ours, they would still hate us and want to harm us - due to the nonstop leftist propaganda against us.</p>
<p>We can do nothing about their genes except separate ourselves from them - but the leftist power-structure won&rsquo;t even let us do that.  It is, however, within the means of that same power-structure to help minimize the hatred blacks have toward us.  All it needs to do is stop preaching hatred against whites.</p>

		<p>I agree with 5 and 6.  The writer of the article is still parsing his words carefully in that way white media types do  about africans, so as to not come across as racist, politically incorrect or offensive to them.  To speak of the africans and their bad behavior they always qualify with social and economic root causes and never place the responsibility on them, their culture or intrinsic differences.  This defensive posturing and kid gloves routine is harmful and only invites attack.  The proper strategy would be an offensive one that assigns blame and responsibility based on truth of fact. One that demands the african culture answer for it with no qualifications and no excuses.  The shuck and jive only works if you play along.</p>

		<p>This article could have been written by some leftist who dared to mention a solid fact  &mdash;  mobs of young blacks are attacking non-blacks.  As in liberal writings, the piece goes on to shout that all black youths are not doing it, the cause is social not biological, and that we must be careful not to tar  &mdash;  oops  &mdash;  paint an entire race with a broad brush.  (Of course the left routinely insists that all whites are racists, doing just that!)<br>
Ghetto blacks are an inherently weak, low-IQ group that views inaction or retreat on the part of their quarry as weakness.  They are emboldened both by any inaction regarding their bad behavior and by any action favorable toward them.  <br>
Black mob attacks will only grow in number and severity.  I have to wonder if the Prez is saying nothing because he&rsquo;s counting on this, hoping that whites will either be afraid not to reelect him for fear of greater unrest or will be afraid to venture out to the polls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a black couple on my right side, and these black kids were running in between all the cars, and they were pounding on my doors and trying to open up doors on my car, and they didn&rsquo;t do one thing to this black couple that was in this car next to us.  They just kept walking right past their car.  They were looking in everybody&rsquo;s windshield as they were running by, seeing who was white and who was black.  Guarantee it.</p>

		<p>The problem is, even assuming that black behavior is genetic (which it almost certainly is), no columnist can openly say that since by definition the blacks are helpless since they are fated to be that way (and one cannot fault them for the genes they inherited, they have no say in the matter).</p>
<p>So, such extremist viewpoints will only condone their behavior at a certain level.<br>

<p>Bennett says, &#8220;No one who matters is actually making remarks about entire groups&#8221;</p>
<p>Really? surely not people such as yourself would ever do that. </p>
<p>So I guess myself along with many other White racialists are among the &#8220;no one who matters&#8221;&hellip;. so I will say that it IS the ENTIRE group.</p>
<p>Hey, Bennett, may I suggest you tell the truth that it is RACE and their genetics that dictate their own behaviors and their crime rates and yes, THEIR racism and violence against White people. Oh, and mention their IQ while you are at it.</p>

		<p>From Post # 4: &#8220;What a pathetic disclaimer. The question is, why does black culture so often turn out this way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another question is why do blacks all over the world behave like this?    &mdash;   in Africa, in London, in Haiti, in Detroit, it is always the same.  Under every type of government from communism to dictatorship to liberal democracy, whereever they go, Africans always produce this type of behavior.  The answer is that genes influence the basis of behavior, including intellegence, time-orientation, risk taking, impulsive behavior, delayed gratification, level of emmotion, empathay, ability to use logic and foresee consequences. Each race develops a different morphology because each race is genetically different.  Each race displays different levels of disease resistance, because each race is genetically different. Each race developes a different type of culture, because each race is genetically different.</p>

<p>Gee&hellip;those poor black folks, getting stuck with such a bad culture!  I wonder how that happened?  I guess when the &#8220;Culture Fairy&#8221; was handing out cultures, blacks just happened to get a raw deal.</p>

<p>Culture is a reflection of the people that created it, not the other way around.</p>
<p>If you say the culture is the problem you are saying that the black race is the problem.</p>
<p>Fools.</p>

And many others warned us that blacks and whites can not coexist side by side.<br>
We were too smart to listen, so there you go.<br>
Now you can&rsquo;t even go to the store at night without the fear of black attack because You Are White.</p>

<p>That darn culture!  Why is culture so mean?  Why does culture make Black people behave that way?  Culture should be severely punished!  </p>
<p>At least there is one thing that I know; Blacks have nothing to do with their manifold social pathologies   &mdash;   it is all due to evil &#8220;Culture&#8221; or evil &#8220;Whites&#8221; or evil &#8220;Racism&rsquo;  or evil &#8220;poverty&#8221; or evil &#8220;barriers to equality&#8221;  or evil &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; or whatever.  </p>

<p>ANDY: AGREED!<br>
Furthermore, it should seem obvious- upon consideration, that blacks, sans very strict laws and controls, have simply reverted to their nature. <br>
They act here, as they do in Africa, to the extent whites allow them to.<br>
Pull all of our laws and norms away, and in a few very short years, it would be pure hutu- tutsi- bantu- zulu hell on earth. If we deny them the &#8220;bling&#8221; of western culture&hellip;fresh water, medical care, cars, colt 45, they will be wearing grass skirts, and be happy as clams (if less intelligent)!<br>
Their PARENTING today simply mirrors what it is, and always was, in Africa&hellip;we consider them abhorrent, however it is their NATURE to hump anything that moves, to sire kids and utterly abandon them, to let women do the work. <br>
They are a sub- species. Recognizing this- as many great and deeply revered minds of note have done- is to help remove anger and hate from the picture. <br>
We NEED to do that, because it is not healthy for US. <br>
We just realize they are as snakes or baboons or whatever. Then we have the correct perspective. We avoid them, we herd them out  whenever possible (deportation) and we defend ourselves as necessary. <br>
That they talk and act halfway like humans complicates things, because you have the sharptons, the Jacksons, the calypso louies, and even the ONE, but let us not digress into sophistry; they are a race apart.</p>

		<p>Like I&rsquo;ve said over and over the past twenty years   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s RAP!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not art or a special culture called &#8220;hip-hop.&#8221; It&rsquo;s garbage spoken in voices so ugly that no decent adult will listen to it, so they have no idea that all these &#8220;mainstream&#8221; artists (Jay-Z, obama&rsquo;s bud?) are rappin about killing &#8220;white devils&#8221; and rape.</p>
<p>Damn! And yet, nobody, outside of pages like this, will admit that yes, a generation listening to rap since they could toddle is going to grow up disfunctional (putting it mildly). (Of course, the entitlement from schools and the media didn&rsquo;t help, and obama&rsquo;s election put the icing on the cake. Where IS Moochelle and her deep caring for young people?)   </p>
