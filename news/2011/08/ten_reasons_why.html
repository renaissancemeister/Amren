<h1>Ten Reasons Why Rick Perry is Bad on Immigration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>George Halstead, American Renaissance, August 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Saturday, August 13th, Texas Governor Rick Perry joined the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Gov. Perry made sure his announcement was timed to quash any bump that other Republican candidates might get from the straw poll held the same day in Ames, Iowa. </p>
<p>Gov. Perry is a sharp political contender. He has never lost an election since entering politics in 1984 and is a tenacious campaigner. Many Republicans see him as their best chance to win back the White House in 2012. Texas is doing well economically  &mdash;  Gov. Perry claims some of the credit for that  &mdash;  and he appeals to both social and economic conservatives. By uniting both groups, Gov. Perry could conceivably win the nomination.	</p>
<p>Gov. Perry&rsquo;s campaign manager, Dan Carney, is just as sharp. He is a New Hampshire native, and knows the Granite State&rsquo;s presidential primary politics very well. The <em>Texas Observer</em> says that &#8220;though a Republican, he&rsquo;s not ideological,&#8221; which tells us something about Gov. Perry.</p>
<p>The Texas governor&rsquo;s strongest Republican rivals are said to be Rep. Michelle Bachmann of Minnesota and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Both have flaws that primary observers are beginning to notice, and some see Mr. Perry as a promising alternative. </p>
<p>Rep. Bachmann talks a good game for conservatives  &mdash;  the immigration reform group NumbersUSA gives her the best score on immigration  &mdash;  but she has no executive experience and may not be able to win over a wider electorate. Gov. Romney has executive experience and is generally seen as more electable than Rep. Bachmann. However, the conservative voter base worries about the liberal and moderate positions Gov. Romney took in the past. </p>
<p>Enter Rick Perry. He is seen as a politician with pizzazz who is electable, credentialed, and holds conservative views that appeal to the Republican base. He may well be able to unite the social and economic factions of the Republican Party, but there is a growing number of what I call &#8220;nationalist&#8221; conservatives whose views need to be courted too. In the past, foreign policy conservatives, or &#8220;hawks,&#8221; were the third leg of the Republican stool, but the hawks got us into quagmires overseas, and Rep. Ron Paul&rsquo;s paleo-libertarian challenge has somewhat muted them for this election cycle.</p>
<p>Nationalist conservatives care more about securing our own borders than securing the borders of other countries. They are against handouts for illegal aliens. They want a wall built along the Mexican border to stop illegal aliens and gangs. They&rsquo;re against amnesty, oppose birthright citizenship, and believe illegal aliens should be deported, not coddled. They believe jobs should go to Americans first, and not to illegal aliens. They may not be AR readers yet, but they have a growing sense that something has gone badly wrong with their country.</p>
<p>How good a candidate is Gov. Perry on these issues? He stinks. He is the worst of the Republicans and here are 10 reasons why:</p>
<p>1. <u>Open Borders</u>: Former Congressman Tom Tancredo, in a devastating article that appeared in <em>Politico</em> on August 11, 2011, notes that Gov. Perry gave a 2001 speech <em>in Mexico</em>, no less, saying he supported completely open borders, in which he called for the &#8220;free flow of individuals between these two countries who want to work and want to be an asset to our country and to Mexico.&#8221; Apparently, there can never be too much immigration from Mexico for Gov. Perry.</p>
<p>2. <u>Border Fence</u>: If you&rsquo;re for open borders, you don&rsquo;t want a border fence. The AP reported that in the same 2001 speech in Mexico, Gov. Perry says, &#8220;But the idea that you&rsquo;re going to build a 1,200 mile wall &hellip; is idiocy. It absolutely would not work.&#8221; </p>
<p>3. <u>An Arizona-style Immigration Law for Texas</u>: Gov. Perry is against interior enforcement of our immigration laws. During the debate over Arizona&rsquo;s anti-illegal immigration SB 1070, he opposed enacting something similar in his state, saying, &#8220;It would not be the right direction for Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. <u>Amnesty</u>: Gov. Perry said Congress didn&rsquo;t have the &#8220;maturity&#8221; to reform our immigration laws, by which he meant granting amnesty. The &#8220;Washington Watcher&#8221; at Vdare.com notes Gov. Perry has called for a &#8220;guest worker program that takes undocumented workers off the black market and legitimizes their economic contributions without providing them with citizenship status.&#8221; In other words, at a time when a record number of Americans are out of work, Gov. Perry&rsquo;s job-creation plan is to make it easier for foreigners to take more of our jobs. </p>
<p>5. <u>Birthright Citizenship</u>: An article at Youth for Western Civilization&rsquo;s blog notes that Gov. Perry &#8220;supports granting citizenship to children of illegal aliens, and opposes legislation to change the current policy which grants citizenship to any child of an illegal alien.&#8221; According to the <em>Washington Post</em>, he has said any change of our current birthright citizenship policies would be &#8220;unconstitutional.&#8221; </p>
<p>For generations, politicians were afraid to touch the question of birthright citizenship, but thanks to Tea Party groups, that is starting to change. By means of a deliberate misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment, any pregnant woman who manages &#8220;to fly, crawl or flop across our borders&#8221; as Jared Taylor once put it, can give birth to an American citizen. Professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas has ably refuted this absurd view of the 14th Amendment. </p>
<p>As Mr. Perry&rsquo;s views become better known among conservative Republicans, they could turn against him. Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann have both spoken out against birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>6. <u>E-Verify</u>: E-Verify is a federal program that lets employers make sure their workers are here legally. Vdare&rsquo;s &#8220;Washington Watcher&#8221; notes that when Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson challenged Gov. Perry for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2010, she called for E-Verify for all Texas state employees. Even that was too much for Gov. Rick Perry, who stated: &#8220;E-Verify would not make a hill of beans difference when it comes to what&rsquo;s happening in America today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Illegal immigrants who are secretly working for Al Queda or MS-13 could get jobs as state employees, but Gov. Perry is opposed to even the most basic effort to weed them out. Apparently, it doesn&rsquo;t make a &#8220;hill of beans difference&#8221; to him. </p>
<p>7. <u>Illegal Aliens as &#8220;Undocumented&#8221;</u>: The same Youth for Western Civilization article reports that in a talk about his big ideas for Texas school students, he said, &#8220;And that vision must include the children of <em>undocumented workers</em>.&#8221; (Emphasis added). &#8220;Undocumented&#8221; is the pro-Amnesty Left&rsquo;s favorite code word for illegal aliens. Needless to say, that &#8220;vision&#8221; includes college education, jobs, and everything else. It is easy to foresee a Republican-promoted amnesty of the &#8220;undocumented&#8221; under a Perry administration, just like the one the last Bush administration served up. </p>
<p>8. <u>In-State Tuition for Illegal Aliens</u>: In 2001, Gov. Perry supported and signed the Texas &#8220;DREAM Act,&#8221; which lets children of illegal aliens pay in-state tuition at Texas universities. It you live in neighboring Arizona, no in-state rates for you; but if your family sneaked illegally into Texas, Gov. Perry wants to give you tuition breaks. </p>
<p>Even the voters of liberal Maryland managed to upend the liberal elites&rsquo; goal of passing a &#8220;DREAM Act&#8221; in that state. So unpopular was the law there, that after a successful petition drive, Maryland voters can now decide its fate themselves in 2012. </p>
<p>9. <u>Bragged About it in Mexico</u>: After he signed the Texas DREAM Act, Gov. Perry went to Mexico to brag about it. According to the <em>Washington Times</em>, he said in Spanish: &#8220;<em>Educacion es el futuro, y si se puede</em>.&#8221; (Education is the future, and yes we can). Gov. Rick Perry, a supposedly conservative governor from the conservative state of Texas, brags in Mexico about transferring more Texas gringo money to more illegal aliens.</p>
<p>In 2009, Mr. Perry received the &#8220;Defender of Jerusalem&#8221; award, which is given to public figures who show a commitment to defending Israel and Jerusalem as its capital. &#8220;I have long supported the right of a Jewish state to exist in the Middle East,&#8221; said the grateful Mr. Perry. He is obviously unconcerned about the rights of a Texan state. </p>
<p>10. <u>Giuliani for President in 2008</u>: There were many conservatives running for the 2008 Republican nomination. Gov. Perry could have backed Rep. Duncan Hunter (CA), former Sen. Fred Thompson (TN), or fellow Texan Rep. Ron Paul. Instead, he supported fellow open-borders advocate, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. </p>
<p>He said he supported Mr. Giuliani for national security reasons, but somehow failed to see how securing our borders is a matter of national security. Perhaps in his heart, and despite his conservative rhetoric, he feels closer to Mr. Giuliani&rsquo;s worldview.</p>
<p>Gov. Perry has made unusual endorsements before. In 1988, when he was still a Democrat, he endorsed Al Gore for president. According to the <em>Houston Chronicle</em>, he even served as Mr. Gore&rsquo;s Texas presidential campaign chairman. It is true that other prominent conservatives were once Democrats, and that Mr. Perry claims he has seen the error of his Democratic ways. Obviously he has not seen all his errors.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Completely Useless on Immigration Issues?</strong></p>
<p>Has Gov. Perry done <em>anything</em> worthwhile on immigration? According to the AP, he talks of sending small teams of Texas Rangers to the border to halt drug trafficking, but the AP also notes that there are only 144 Texas Rangers in the whole state. And as Gov. Perry himself notes, there are 1,200 miles of border between Texas and Mexico that he&rsquo;s happy to keep fenceless and unsecured.</p>
<p>Also according to AP, Gov. Perry got $2 million in federal grants that were supposed to go to border sheriffs so they could place 200 cameras along the border. Somehow, few were ever built, and the ones that were built didn&rsquo;t work. </p>
<p>This year, Gov. Rick Perry made a half-hearted attempt to pass a bill that would prevent Texas cities from giving &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; to illegal aliens. The bill failed, but Gov. Perry will probably tout this on the campaign trail whenever anyone doubts his immigration credentials.</p>
<p>To his credit, he did get a Voter ID bill passed, but <em>that is about it</em> for Gov. Perry. </p>
<p>According to data from the Federation of Americans for Immigration Reform (FAIR), illegal immigrants cost Texas more than $4.7 billion every year for education, medical care, and jail costs. Even if the estimated tax contributions of illegal aliens who are working (many of them aren&rsquo;t) are subtracted, net outlays still amount to more than $3.7 billion per year. This means illegal immigrants drain every Texas household of about $725 a year. On top of that, illegal immigrants get free treatment for drug addiction and mental illness. If they ever get amnesty, the costs will soar because they will become eligible for yet more handouts.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Big Texas Financial Donors Want Open Borders</strong></p>
<p>What accounts for all this &#8220;compassion&#8221; for illegal aliens? Much of it could be due to the big donors to the Texas Republican Party, many of whom rely on cheap, er, &#8220;undocumented&#8221; labor. According to the AP, the Texas Association of Business (TAB), which is one of Gov. Perry&rsquo;s strong backers, adamantly opposes immigration control. &#8220;The economy would suffer without undocumented workers,&#8221; says TAB president Bill Hammad. &#8220;We need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vdare.com points out two other big financial backers of the Texas Republican Party, Bob Perry (no relation to Rick Perry) of homebuilding company Perry Homes, and grocery chain owner Charles Butt. Both helped kill the bill that would end sanctuary cities in Texas. Bob Perry was Rick Perry&rsquo;s biggest donor in 2010. When you include Big Agribusiness, there are plenty of wealthy donors who want their steady supply of cheap, illegal labor, and could care less about the costs to the social fabric and to the taxpayer. </p>
<p>AR readers oppose illegal immigration, not just because it&rsquo;s illegal, but because of the long-term demographic threat it poses to this nation. Ninety percent of both legal and illegal immigrants come from the Third World, and this will eventually make whites and their descendants a hated minority in their own country. </p>
<p>A mostly Third-World population will turn us into a Third-World country, but such an elementary insight is beyond the grasp of Rick Perry. He hisses that people like former Rep. Tom Tancredo are &#8220;racist&#8221; for supporting immigration control.</p>
<p>Most Republican presidential contenders will probably be too cowardly to attack Gov. Perry directly on immigration, or if they do, they will not press him for fear of being called &#8220;racist.&#8221; So it will be up to us to get the word out to friends and family, and to link up with organizations that don&rsquo;t want an open-borders fanatic as the Republican nominee. </p>
<p>Gov. Perry&rsquo;s record on immigration should keep him from getting any Republican votes. Rep. Bachmann and even Gov. Romney are better, so immigration reform activists need to make stopping Gov. Perry their number-one priority. If they succeed, it will be a strong message to other Republicans that it&rsquo;s not enough to tout the conservative line on social and economic issues alone. Nationalist questions are important, too. </p>
<p>Right now, we don&rsquo;t even get lip service on national issues. In the past, Republican voters have given the nomination to candidates who were bad on immigration, such as George W. Bush and John McCain, and this is one of the reasons nationalist interests are not taken seriously within the party. This needs to change, and it would send a sharp message if Rick Perry were to be stopped. </p>

		<p>From the 14-point case against the Rickroller on Alex Jones&rsquo;s website:</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>#8 Between December 2007 and April 2011, weekly wages in the U.S. increased by about 5 percent.  In the state of Texas they increased by just 0.6% over that same time period.</p>
<p>#11 Texas has the highest percentage of workers making minimum wage out of all 50 states.</p>
<p>#13 In 2007, 221,000 residents of Texas were making minimum wage or less.  By 2010, that number had risen to 550,000.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Those are clues of his immigration treachery, and a clue that whatever place this is describing is experiencing a vast increase in the population of its cheap labor racial lumpenproletariat.  It also proves that the &#8220;job growth machine&#8221; in Texas he&rsquo;ll brag about is one of cheap labor (often illegally cheap) Hispanics lowering the wage scale.</p>

		<p>Ron Paul is probably the best candidate with regard to immigration, legal and illegal (despite being smeared by supposed immigration activists).</p>
<p>Although it is true that he does not talk big on the issue (and do nothing) like most of the republican RINOS, Paul&rsquo;s stance of ending the warfare/welfare state is the ONLY reasonably effective anti-immigration plan I&rsquo;ve seen proposed.</p>
<p>So called &#8220;immigrants&#8221; are nothing of the sort.  They are an invading army that uses our welfare system as their supply line and method of looting the country they are invading.  Almost all welfare that doesn&rsquo;t go to the old folks is used by blacks to buy drugs, which Mexicans sell them to fund their drug empire.  Cut off the welfare and you solve the problem.</p>
<p>What our country REALLY needs is to embrace racism and discrimination.  In other words, only whites can have welfare.  Back in the early days, when it was understood that welfare was for poor whites who were sick and elderly or good white Christian families immediately ready to normalize, there was no problem.  EVERYONE understood that blacks use money to buy 1) alcohol, 2) drugs and 3) guns that they immediately used to murder white men and rape white women.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s still true today, but nobody believes it.  Although the behavior is universal and easily observed, white people no longer believe it.  Segregation, followed by media manipulation by another race that uses blacks and Mexicans as a means to wage war on us, has created a 1984 like existence.  People randomly suffer the consequences of what is going on but extreme measures keep them from seeing the scope and breadth of the problem.</p>
<p>Notice the issue of &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; is making that more and more difficult.  I wonder what will happen when the majority whites know the truth.</p>

		<p>Republican candidates are afraid of the National Right to Life Council and the National Rifle Association because they are PACs  &mdash;  political action committees, in other words, they put their money where there mouth is, they give money only to those candidates who support their views.  American nationalists will not be taken seriously until we have a PAC which stands for our concerns about views.  Tom Tancredo has such a PAC, it is called the Team America Pac which can be found on www.teamamericapac.org.  Pass the word around.</p>

		<p>The open borders ideology is a wishful look back to the plantation days, when whites controlled the properties and blacks and browns did the agricultural labour.</p>
<p>According to the open borders enthusiasts we should all quit our jobs and start companies, and profit from having a dark-hued workforce of cheap Mexicans. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a narrowly focused view which is out of touch with today&rsquo;s economic, social and legal reality.</p>

		<p>This is precisely the information that needs to be spread far and wide.  If Mr. Halstead does not object, I plan to cut and paste his summary, perhaps change enough words to obscure its provenance (hey, I&rsquo;m a realist about race realism in today&rsquo;s PC climate, and as I believe Stonewall Jackson put it, mislead, misdirect, mystify), then pass along to as many people as I would consider receptive to the message.  Great work!  This kind of reference work would be great to have for anyone considered the front runner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That said, right out of the chute, of cause for deep concern is an apparently close relationship Perry has fostered over the years with a Muslim leader know as &#8220;His Highness&#8221; Prince Shah Karim Al-Husayni, the Aga Khan IV.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear he&rsquo;s been pandering to La Raza, somehow thinking he could convince just enough of the Mexican vote to keep him in office.  Betray the entire nation, so he can stay in office  &mdash;  now that&rsquo;s what I call a real American.</p>
<p>He stated, &#8220;But the idea that you&rsquo;re going to build a 1,200 mile wall &hellip; is idiocy. It absolutely would not work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He should check his history books  &mdash;  China did it.  Ever hear of the Great Wall?  And yes, it was successful and served its purpose.  Yes, it&rsquo;s pathetic that we even need a wall, but it would send a message loud and clear.<br>

<p>She has one big asset  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s a woman. Americans are going to be hit with a heavy guilt trip by the MSM for even thinking of ousting the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;first black president&#8221; from office. One way to assuage their guilt might be to elect the nation&rsquo;s first <i>woman</i> president. </p>
<p>On the political correctness scale, black trumps female, but if brainwashed Americans are going to throw Obama out of office, a woman may be their least guilty choice.</p>

		<p>Rick Perry is an absolute disaster for the Republican Party and the US nation. He is right about the wall though - forget the wall, or if we need to build them - put it at high traffic areas, not the difficult areas to pass since they naturally will be hard enough. </p>
<p>What we need to do for illegal immigration is simple, and I am a Indian legal immigrant that works in medicine (and trust me, we need to stop immigration period if we want to truly save healthcare, and the nation) - 1) End birthright citizenship unless both parents are legal citizens (not this nonsense one about one legal citizen, both have to be citizens period. Both my parents and I were not, we naturalized. This single change or interpretation will cut off so much of this unnecessary population growth.  </p>
<p>2) Enforce the immigration laws with force and give local and state police the authority to arrest and deport any illegal immigrant, and yes if you can&rsquo;t speak English, or look like you don&rsquo;t belong, you might be an illegal immigrant (I don&rsquo;t care if you were brought over as a 2 yo, or u&rsquo;re nursing or caring for someone, buh bye, thanks for playing, now get out of here. </p>
<p>3) Put a moratorium on legal immigration, we don&rsquo;t need any more people period.  Honestly we need to get rid of a lot of people - here&rsquo;s a proposal that will never happen but should - if you think this country is so racist, and so bad, that you have to commit crime consistently, you get a one way ticket back to your country of origin (doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re white, black, purple, yellow, red, orange, etc. I don&rsquo;t give a flying f&hellip;) - could you imagine dropping for example, black convicts off in the jungles of the congo - I would pay to watch that on tv - like those reality tv shows. </p>
<p>4) Have stringent rules for any immigrants - Speak English, and that we really need your skill that we cannot find here (which should be no one, we have plenty of talented people here). </p>
<p>5. End visa lottery, end chain migration, just end immigration period. We need emigration, voluntary or forced. </p>
<p>Sorry had to get that off my chest, it is so sickening to watch these leaders and the media so distort the single most important issue in this country - continually adding low skilled people to a country is a disaster - No more please. I think if we don&rsquo;t solve this problem within the next 2 yrs - the US will have civil wars and no longer exist. Seriously. </p>

<p>An excellent article, and yet another reminder of why AmRen is such a valuable resource. This is information you just won&rsquo;t find anywhere else   &mdash;   at least not all collected in one place like it is here. A very damning collection of facts, intelligently and digestibly presented by the author. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d had my suspicions about Gov. Perry, but this piece has, for me, definitely tipped the scale against him. I have to admit that before I read this, I didn&rsquo;t even know that Perry began his political career as a Democrat&hellip; although it certainly does explain a few things about him! </p>

<p>Do you actually think Bachmann or Romney have the background and the connections needed to overcome our energy problems?</p>
<p>Do you think Arab leaders would recognize President Bachmann as a peer?</p>
<p>Do you think Romney&rsquo;s economic track record in Massachusetts makes him the man we need to repair our shattered economy?</p>
<p>Do you believe that either Bachmann or Romney are turning down contributions from the Cheap Labor Treason Lobby?</p>
<p>Do you think Bachmann or Romney would have stood strong against the president, the U.N. and the World court and gone ahead and executed that Mexican killer a while back?  </p>

		<p>Most Republican presidential contenders will probably be too cowardly to attack Gov. Perry directly on immigration, or if they do, they will not press him for fear of being called &ldquo;racist.&rdquo; So it will be up to us to get the word out to friends and family, and to link up with organizations that don&rsquo;t want an open-borders fanatic as the Republican nominee. </p>
<p><br>
Correct you are! What bothers me though was a clip I saw on Fox news with the little boy and his mother pressing Perry about evolution v/s creationism. I don&rsquo;t mean to offend any religious folks here, but there are more urgent issues at hand. Our country is on the verge of financial collapse, White America is being displaced and replaced, and we are constantly being discriminated against. I would love to be in one of those crowds when Perry is campaigning, because you can bet I&rsquo;d ask him the tough questions! </p>

Obama is beatable with the right candidate but I don&rsquo;t see any viable mainstream candidates that I would want to vote for. The Republicans are naturally going to go for a broad appeal candidate but who will be largely wishy washy and middle of the road on tough issues.</p>
<p>Perry comes off to me as an evangelical Christian preacher type (or a snake oil salesman). The smile says &#8216;used car salesman&rsquo; to me. Bachmann also needs to tone down her smile. </p>
<p>Who is there to vote for? Gingrich, the recalcitrant troglodyte who invokes the scared name of Reagan in every other sentence? Palin is good at rallying the troops but she&rsquo;s unelectable and I just don&rsquo;t see her as a leader. Her &#8216;realty TV&rsquo; lifestyle is a major turnoff for me even if I considered voting for her.  </p>
<p>Even Ron Paul is essentially an open border cheerleader.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 4 said: &ldquo;The open borders ideology is a wishful look back to the plantation days, when whites controlled the properties and blacks and browns did the agricultural labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are far too optimistic.  Outside the plantation there were White working class and middle class people. Plantation owners were glad of this.  And they didn&rsquo;t engage in an all-out war against dirt poor Whites.  They had a sense of racial loyalty.  The Powers that Be of today want a non-White, less intelligent, less educated population because they are easier to control.  They do not &ldquo;secretly&rdquo; prefer White people, but have no idea what they are doing.  They know full well and do not care.  I am not saying that this is true of every White person who is wealthy or even true of every White person who has a certain degree of power.  However it is true of a controlling percentage at the very top.<br>

		<p>I agree with the point Tim in Indiana made about Bachmann being more palatable to guilty white folks.  I have no problem with her lack of experience in certain areas.  As someone who once ran for and won the presidency of my union local, I know that in many ways the job makes the man.  The most important lesson I learned from that experience was that nobody is ever truly &#8220;experienced&#8221; enough for a top leadership role.  I put off running for that job for years because I didn&rsquo;t think I was ready, a la Chris Christie.  Once I actually won the job, I realized there were challenges nobody is ever really &#8220;ready&#8221; for.  You just have to use your best judgement, stick to your principles, and know when you don&rsquo;t know the answer, and know how to find out what you need to know.  I think either Bachmann or Palin would be good presidents.  My gut feeling about Perry is not good, but I know I don&rsquo;t know enough right now to judge so, I will do what I suggest everyone do.  I will find out more about him.  Twenty twelve is a long way off yet.</p>

If you understand that Putin is the Real Thing, that Russia&rsquo;s illegal immigration problems are due to compromise with C.Asian states to keep the Russian minority in power there and to stop pan-Turkic Islam by taking the burden off of C.Asian economies, then you know that you must support Ron Paul.</p>

<p>Well said, but the Mexican vote is just part of it. His views on immigration are part of his strategy for positive exposure by the liberal media/press, something Tea Party Republicans will never receive. </p>
<p>I suspect Perry of being, to some degree, a shill for the Democrats (maybe unknowingly). Unfortunately, all you need to do is tell millions of white American conservatives what a big Christian you are, and they&rsquo;ll believe you can do no wrong.

These wealthy whites are the ones who have brought non-whites to the shores of the USA!

<p>Many wealthy whites support and control the GOP! These whites want to see as many non-whites as possible in this country for cheap labor. The GOP will never get rid of non-whites. Remember, George W. Bush and his numerous pushes for amnesty for illegals. Rick Perry is another George W. Bush clone!</p>
<p>As a middle class white, I have given up on the GOP. If I see someone like David Duke on the ballot, I will vote for him. The GOP is not white friendly.  All they care about is cheap labor and money.</p>

<p>This article is not the ONLY one telling those of us with minds, &#8216;beware Perry.&rsquo; Chuck Baldwin, VDare, and a number of other &#8216;evangelical&rsquo; sites are not bamboozled by GW.Bush II (or is it III?)</p>
<p>I say we go with Ron Paul as Pres, and Bachmann as VP. That way, she will get the training she needs, we have a man and a woman who stand united against the Obamanation, we defuse anything Hillary might throw at us (there is talk of Obama ditching Biden, and nominating Hill- ugh!), and the Evangelical conservatives, as well as the Libertarian conservatives could work TOGETHER.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference (said Baldwin) if a person is an agnostic, if he holds to the laws and customs of the Founding Fathers, rather than this &#8216;Brave new Marxist World&rsquo; that Perry seems totally uninterested in halting, in its&rsquo; implementation, if his record against Anglos in Texas is ANY indication.</p>

		<p>Perry is in fact a traitor to the US if he favors unbridled immigration. Immigrants, refugees, minorities and their entitlement programs are EXACTLY what&rsquo;s killing this great country as we speak.</p>
<p>No US president during the past 50 years has shown any serious inclination to reverse course on American culture, to put a lid on cultural Marxism and &#8220;political correctness&#8221; to follow the Constitution in education or energy politics, to protect our borders or to stop (or not start) senseless foreign wars. For fifty years of bad Presidents the people tagged along and said nothing. The only exception, the only period of time when the American people developed some sort of political freedom, common sense consciousness are the Obama years. The groundswell of conservatism (or simply anti big government sentiment) is becoming stronger and the social tensions much more palpable. It becomes obvious that we have done many things the wrong way. For these reasons, it might be best for America if she had to suffer through a few more Obama years. Now to ring those in, we have two choices in 2012: 1) We vote for Obummer. 2) We vote for a Republican candidate who says and does all the right things but will not carry the vote. After the 2012 election and under Obama/Clinton we continue to work for regime change with a backdrop of a substantially more dissatisfied and politically militant people that becomes increasingly prone to clean up DC in a very fundamental manner.</p>

<p>Who are &#8216;The Powers that Be of today&rsquo; other than those who the American people have elected and those they have selected to help them serve the American people? We are, after all living in a Democratic society . The Immigration Act of 1965 which many posters are against was passed by a vote of 326 to 69 by the House and 76 to 18 by the Senate and was sign by President Lyndon Johnson who won the 1964 election. These are people who the American people had put in office.</p>
<p>Today the average American is much more educated than in the past. In 1940, for example, only 4.9 percent of Whites had a four year degree are more. Today about one-third of the population have a four year degree, and the rate is growing for every racial group .</p>
<p>So &#8216;The Powers that Be of Today&rsquo; are ruling over a more educated society not less.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s really no reason yet to believe that Perry will be a serious contender.  The leftist media has been pushing him as the GOP candidate, obviously for nefarious purposes  &mdash;  the same way they touted Mormon John Huntsman as the un-Romney.  The MSM no doubt feels that Perry will be utterly objectionable to many Republicans and other conservatives, who might sit out the election if he&rsquo;s the nominee.  The media also apparently believes that many independents and Reagan Democrats won&rsquo;t like him.  </p>
<p>Hopefully, the facts about Perry&rsquo;s duplicity and pro-illegal, pro-Moslem actions will reach a lot of primary voters.  To me, though, the most important vote I can cast is one to remove Obama from office, even if I vote for the lesser of two evils.</p>

		<p>More immigrants mean more people. More people mean more customers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. If you get your income from interest, rent, and dividends, you benefit from a high degree of immigration. If you work for a living, you pay with a lower standard of living. <br>
 <br>
Economic conservatives like Rick Perry agree with me that the high rate of immigration contributes to the growing income gap. They disagree that this is a problem. It does not matter how much a Republican politician likes country and western music, and old time religion. If he favors fewer barriers on immigration he is an enemy to white working people. </p>

<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there a recent poll saying that only 17% of Americans feel that the U.S. government has the consent of the governed?  So most people do not feel that their elected representatives are in fact representing them.  Sorry for using the word &ldquo;educated&rdquo; however.  I guess that could be a bit confusing.  What I meant was independent thinking skills, not the number of years spent in school.  The two really do not correlate very well.</p>

<p>The people in 1940&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s  did NOT want that 1965 Immigration Act! Many did not want the civil Rights Act either yet the &#8220;powers that be&#8221; FORCED it unto the people.  Since when does the &#8220;elite&#8221; (power brokers) listen to the people? Doesn&rsquo;t matter who you vote for. Look behind the scenes and you may find your answer of the powers that be.

<p>As for people being more &#8220;educated&#8221; now, that IS the problem.  You know as well as the rest of us WHO &#8220;educates&#8221;. Also look at WHO gets to vote. Liberals, Blacks, communists, Mexicans, Asians, Indians, and every third world &#8220;American citizen&#8221; in this country who should never be here in the first place. They outnumber us 10 to 1.

In fact, who is the Republican presidential candidate that has gone on record commiting to build Border fence to seal the southern border of the U.S. completely if elected? Romney? Bachmann?

<p>Thank you for restoring my sanity.  I thought I was the only person on Earth who saw through that facade.  Obviously any apparent &#8220;feud&#8221; or &#8220;rift&#8221; between the Bush and Perry camps is manufactured and pure propaganda, in order to triangulate Perry away from the second worst President in American history.  They&rsquo;re ideologically exactly alike, for all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>Look up the 1998 race for Texas Lieutenant Governor.  Bush won re-election as Governor that year in a landslide, but Rick Perry, then an Ag Commissioner, barely won Lieutenant Governor over some Democrat.  Bush did everything he could to win that race for Perry, because the political gurus said at the time that Perry&rsquo;s win was more important to him than his own win that day, as he wanted a Republican behind him to slide in as Governor in advance of his own Presidential campaign in 2000.  If Perry had not won, Bush may not have run for President.  (And obviously, Perry wouldn&rsquo;t be running for President today.)  Makes me want to jump into a time machine, head back to 1998, and plant 70,000 Democrat votes in some South Texas barrio precincts.  Of course it probably means John McCain would have been the Republican nominee in 2000, and we all know how that would have turned out.  Then again maybe we would be better off if Al Gore would have become President in 2000, his response to 9/11 would have been militarily wimpy, but better that than decade long expensive occupations of two (now going on six) Muslim countries.  Gore wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped Muslim immigration, but neither did Bush.  And Congressional Republicans would have instinctively resisted Gore&rsquo;s big government welfare spending, when Bush did it enough Republicans were neutralized.  </p>
<p>Point is, Bush loved Perry when he needed him.  Like you, I&rsquo;m not buying this &#8220;rift.&#8221; </p>

As if the US isn&rsquo;t already blowing billions on health care for undocumented aliens, now he wants the US to subsidize health care for Mexicans who stay there too? </p>
<p>4 more years of fighting Obama tooth and nail at every turn with a congress stacked to the hilt with Tea Party congressmen over the next couple of elections is better than voting in this guy, who would just add legitimacy to amnesty issues by giving the nod from the GOP.

<p>These wealthy whites control the Republican Party. They want to lower the minimum wage to $2.00. No white person will work for $2.00, but many illegal Mexicans will gladly do so. These greedy whites also have shipped millions of jobs that poor and middle class whites did overseas to nations like China. </p>
<p>We poor and middle class whites are capable of being the best workers in the world. We proved this in 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. We are better than the Chineses, Mexicans, or Indians. Greedy whites took away our jobs and encouraged millions of non-whites to come to the USA by giving them our jobs.</p>
<p>The greatest threat to White Nationalists is not non-whites, but rather wealthy whites who want to bring in millions of non-whites to work for low wages. Wealthy whites don&rsquo;t care about their race. All they care about is lining their pockets with money!</p>

My parents did not have &#8220;an education&#8221; but they sure knew how to read, write, spell, and do math and USED their brains and used COMMON SENSE compared to those on the left and the right today.

You ask, &#8220;If not Perry, then who?&#8221;  How &#8216;bout just about any other Republican who&rsquo;s running?  I can never understand why, in every major political race, at least one candidate is posed with this question.  And you believe the fight against illegal immigration is lost and that we&rsquo;d better just worry about excessive gun control?  If we have truly lost the battle over the onslaught of illegals, everything else we have is lost as well.  We will become an extension of Mexico, and probably no authority in such a godforesaken realm will worry about taking up guns, bazookas, rocket launchers, or anything else.  <br>
I believe we&rsquo;ve done a pretty good job of protecting our Second Amendment Rights.  Courts are tending to find in favor of the right to bear arms, rather than against it.  But the illegal alien problem is being virtually ignored by most politicians, while third-worlders are swarming our borders.  We must demand that Presidential candidates address this problem pro-actively!  And Perry&rsquo;s record on the matter is horrendous!<br>

		<p>Gov Perry as president?  I certainly hope not!!</p>
<p>Best comment on the board is the following from Mr. Engelman:</p>
<p><i>If he favors fewer barriers on immigration he is an enemy to White working people.</i></p>
<p>I would tweak that a bit John as:  mortal enemy to White working people to emphasize the gravity to White America of leaving the borders wide open.</p>
<p>Perry gives me the creeps.   I sense a slippery, sneaky, uneasy energy from him. I felt the same thing when I first saw Bill Clinton on TV as one of about 6 possible candidates.</p>
<p>At the time I thought: &ldquo;That guy&rsquo;s a snake! Never will the American people elect Bill Clinton&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great conservative Perry is:</p>
<p>What about that pesky Gardasil Executive Order? </p>
<p><i>On February 2, 2007, Governor Perry issued an executive order mandating that Texas girls be vaccinated with Gardasil. The order would become effective in 2008 and girls would be immunized as they entered the 6th grade.</i></p>
<p><i>The Act of Issuing An Executive Order of this Type is Unconstitutional&hellip; The Texas legislature voted 30-1 to overturn the executive order.</i></p>
<p><i>After long defending the decision, Mr. Perry has apologized repeatedly for the order since launching his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. As recently as his 2010 gubernatorial re-election bid, Mr. Perry touted the vaccine&rsquo;s medical efficacy and the lives of young women it saved.</i></p>
<p>And, much worse, how about the sordid TRANS TEXAS CORRIDOR&hellip; done  0bama style - all with the hope of enormous kickbacks from CINTRA - a Spanish company contracted with secret details to build a huge 1200 ft. wide roadway in Texas. Perry refused to release the details of the 50-year deal which included grabbing citizens&rsquo; land all along the way&hellip; Thankfully,  in July of 2010, the FHA rendered an official decision of &ldquo;no action&rdquo; formally ending the project. </p>

<p>The NRA is no friend to Conservatives.  The NRAs political arm often take stands that are at odds with the interests of its gun-owning members.</p>
<p>Under the Patriot Act, the DOJ has stepped up efforts to track gun owners by obtaining &#8220;business records&#8221; from gun dealers.  The FBI recently sent out notices to gun shops and clubs reminding them that they must keep records of all customers&rsquo; identities and purchases, urging them to report any &#8220;suspicious&#8221; behavior including &#8220;altered appearances&#8221;, &#8220;paying with cash&#8221;, or making &#8220;racist statements.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NRA opposed Senator Rand Paul&rsquo;s amendment to protect law-abiding gun owners from some of the privacy invasions being carried out by the feds under the Act.  The amendment failed.</p>
<p>A better organization is the National Association for Gun Rights (www.nationalgunrights.org).</p>

		<p>The Bushes really do dislike Perry because Perry is not a &#8220;Blue state&#8221; conservative like them. Papa Bush came to Texas for the same reason a Chinaman came to America in the 19th century-to make a hatful and then hightail it back home! Papa Bush thought the prospects to make a hatful were much better in the oil patch than in the pine forests of Maine, but whenever he vacationed he went, not to Texas, but to the ancestral digs at &#8220;Sissybunkport&#8221;, Maine. Perry&rsquo;s ancestors didn&rsquo;t come to Texas to make a hatful and leave. Neither the Bushes nor the mainstream media want a red-state conservative anywhere near the levers of power. At least Perry is not one of those goofy &#8220;jewish dispensationalist&#8221; Fundamentalists like Palin, Bachmann or Huckabee.</p>

<p>This is the kind foolish thinking that has held back nationalism in America.  Nationalists in Europe have made dramatic gains and are close to taking power in several countries because they refused to support (very slightly)lesser of two evils candidates.  By doing so, they forced concessions from the center right parties as well.  </p>
<p>If there is going to be any hope that future GOP presidential candidates will be immigration restrictionists, open borders candidates must lose in the primaries and elections. The GOP is not going to change it&rsquo;s tune on immigration if the primary voters keep buying what people like Bush, McCain and Perry are selling.

		<p>I am sure every Texan can remember how Mr. Perry got re-elected governor. He went around the state talking about how HE was going to solve the illegal alien mess by enforcement. HE was going to sent the Texas State Militia to the border to stop the invasion. HE was going to put cameras along the border to observe and report illegals entering the state from Mexico. (HE even recruited citizens to monitor the cameras as volunteers, by way of their internet connection, and call Border Patrol if illegals crossed the border. He was going to round up the illegals and put them out of TEXAS. Yes, that was Rick Perry&hellip;..the best liar in the world. No sooner than the ballots been counted, the next morning after the election, Mr. Rick Perry completely repudiated himself and everything he had promised to do about the invasion by illegal aliens from Mexico. Now no one trusts Mr. Perry anymore and there is no state-wide office he can dare to run for, since few Texans would vote for the bastard. So he MUST run for President of the United States. It is the ONLY office still open to him. He cannot get elected meter maid in Texas. Maybe he thinks no one remembers or he can snucker everyone else in the USA with big talk and worthless promises. Too late Rick&hellip;..we are onto your game. You won&rsquo;t trick us twice, sonny.<br>

		<p>I think we need to quit focusing our entire political rage on the issue of immigration. The fact is that both legal and illegal immigration has been enabled by elitist leftist and neocons for so long that it is simply a study in futility to expect to elect a candidate who takes a hard conservative line on immigration and borders. He would simply not be electable because he would be an easy target for the crowd that sees a racist lurking around every corner.</p>
<p>Incidentally Gore would have been an absolute disaster for this country. A much greater disaster than Bush turned out to be. He would have been a much more effective vehicle for change than Obama has been, since he was a political insider and a member of the leftist elite. Gore would surely have extended the Clinton era assault weapons ban and implemented the UN Small Arms Treaty.<br>
Many UN internationalist elitists are on the record as lamenting<br>
Gores failure at being elected.</p>
<p>I hate to keep harping on second amendment issues, but immigration and the economy can be smoke screens for even bigger issues. Neither are solvable overnight and both threaten to undermine our racial and national sovereignty. A right once lost is a right that is lost forever and we need to defend those rights we have with all the passion we can muster. We can adapt to the changes wrought by immigration and economic issues, but as a people we could not survive the loss of a Constitutionally guaranteed right. Losing our second amendment rights would put us on the road to an inevitable change in government which would not be in our favor.</p>
<p>No candidate can be elected who doesn&rsquo;t pull in at least a portion of the Hispanic and black vote. And any candidate who wants to get elected is going to have to worship at the altar of change. One wonders if any candidate would be electable if he tried to separate himself from the global elitists entirely. We could only hope that a Perry would be much more &#8216;conservative&rsquo; with the changes than Obama would be. I know that this doesn&rsquo;t set well with some of us, but it is a fact of political life in this country in the 21st century.     </p>

		<p>Building a wall across the border won&rsquo;t help us any more than the Great Wall of China helped the Chinese. Yes, the Great Wall was a fantastic piece of engineering, but the Mongols didn&rsquo;t have any trouble getting past it. All they had to do was march through one of the gates. No one knows who let them in, but one theory says that &#8220;the Onguts, a Turkic tribe who&hellip;defended a section of the Great Wall, were persuaded by Genghis to switch sides.&#8221; (&#8220;How the Barbarian Invasions Shaped The Modern World,&#8221; Craughwell, p. 269.) The history of the West is full of examples of walls being scaled, battered down with siege engines, undermined by tunneling, etc., etc., but their biggest weaknesses are their gates and the people who guard them. Assuming we could somehow compel our glorious leaders to build a border wall, who do you think would end up guarding it? All you have to do is look at the TSA to get the answer.</p>

<p>I disagree. Immigration will drastically change EVERYTHING in our country. Our culture, heritage, language, economic system, political system, and legal system. It will not be changed for the better, either.</p>
<p>We will have a Latin American type country here.</p>
<p>The problem all along has been that the politicians have not enforced our immigrations laws. Then when 20-35 million illegal aliens are in our county(this does not count their anchor babies), these same politicans and some Americans throw up their hands and inform us that we have to &#8220;adapt to change.&#8221; It is the adapting to change and not fighting it that got us into this mess in the first place.</p>
<p>As for voting, Repulicans might as well understand that they will NEVER win future major elections if they have to rely on Blacks and Hispanics. Demographically, the odds will be against them if they don&rsquo;t do something about immigration. The nonwhites LOVE big government and will never want to give that up.</p>

<p>Pardon me, but I totally disagree with all you have said. You sound just like one of those political &#8220;strategists&#8221; who wimp out at the mere mention of &#8220;racist&#8221;. So we need to add tens of millions MORE immigrants on top of what we already have who procreate at the drop of a hat? You say, they won&rsquo;t vote for a Republican if we do not stop with the immigration talk. We won&rsquo;t have a country left if we don&rsquo;t STOP immigration and DEPORT!!! Your solution is to cave and do nothing and let us be taken away in a tidal wave of hordes of even more &#8220;immigrants&#8221;? Nonsense.</p>
<p> You are a defeatist telling us to give up on immigration and the HARM it has done to America and to Whites. Your solution is for the conservatives to cave more than they already have to the nonwhites and 3rd worlders in this country. AMERICA will be HELL for any White to live in if we follow your &#8220;solution&#8221;.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get it? What good is having a GUN, when the nonwhites don&rsquo;t obey our laws in the first place and will outnumber you 10 to 1 with guns that far outnumber yours and weapons YOU would never be able to acquire? You think a minority run nation will allow you to have a gun in the first place? Think again.</p>
<p> I have to laugh at your attempt to convince us that &#8220;they&#8221; will somehow all vote Repub if we just give them what they want and run from the word, racist. Would we just not become a ONE Party political country. There would be no difference between the Dems and the Repubs if that is the case. I cannot even phantom why a racialist would admit defeat and cave such as you have. If you are a Texan, then you are no poster boy for what Texans USED to stand for. Could it be that Texas is now flooded with mexicans because of people with your &#8220;thinking&#8221; on immigration? </p>

		<p><i>Building a wall across the border won&rsquo;t help us any more than the Great Wall of China helped the Chinese.</i> </p>
<p>Walls work.  Ask the Israelis.  </p>
<p><i>According to statistics published by the Israeli government, between 2000 and July 2003, when the &#8216;first continuous segment&rsquo; of the barrier was built, 73 Palestinian suicide bombings were carried out from the West Bank, killing 293 Israelis and injuring over 1,900. However, from August 2003 and the end of 2006, only 12 attacks were carried out, killing 64 Israelis and wounding 445.  Supporters argue that this is indicative of the barrier being effective in preventing such attacks.</i></p>
<p>Walls work so well that the Israelis are building another wall to protect themselves:</p>
<p><i>Israel approved a plan on Sunday to hold and deport thousands of illegal migrant workers whom Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as a &#8216;threat to the character of the country&hellip;We must stop the mass entry of illegal migrant workers because of the very serious threat to the character and future to the state of Israel,&rdquo; he said, adding Israelis who gave them work would face severe fines to make their employment unviable.</i></p>
<p><i>Last week Israel began work to construct a barrier to seal off part of the border with Egypt&rsquo;s Sinai desert from where many of the migrants enter</i>.</p>
<p>Good for Mr. Netanuyahu for looking out for the best interests of his people.  Would that the American government would do the same.  Greece is also building a wall, wonder why?:</p>
<p><i>Greece said on Monday it planned a fence at its border with Turkey in the Evros region to prevent a wave of immigrants flowing into the debt-choked country.</i></p>
<p>Even India constructed a barrier to keep out its poorer neighbors:</p>
<p><i>Since the mid-1990s, India has been involved in the construction of some of the lengthiest separation barriers along its international borders. Six of the nine countries neighboring India are classified as Least Developed Countries. As a consequence, thousands of people from these countries, especially from Bangladesh, Nepal and Burma, illegally immigrate into India. The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier and Indo-Burma barrier are being built to check smuggling, illegal immigration and possible infiltration by terrorists.</i></p>
<p>Walls work.  Those making excuses, such as pelosi-types don&rsquo;t want a wall built.  But then the USG has no intention of protecting White lives.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve beaten back about 5 or 6 mass amnesties and taken down some RINOs (Specter) and given strong scared to some other RINOs (McCaine and Lindsey Graham) over the issue of their terrible immigration records. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve taken back many Southern state house of representatives and made immigration control THE issue in electing the Governor of Arizona. </p>
<p>OK, so we just need to make our effective activism have an impact on Presidential races. This just takes work and using our growing network of activists. Don&rsquo;t whine and complain that no one is listening or how it&rsquo;s hopeless because of some vast conspiracy by all powerful elites.</p>
<p>Look how much pain we caused McCaine - who was back pedaling big time and had to put out adverts that he had &#8220;gotten the message&#8221; and was now on our side.</p>
<p>So just get in there and do battle. I always use 9/11/01 as the key event for the immigration issue. Those people who are for open borders immigration allowed, supported the 9/11/01 Al Qaeda terrorist attack, we were always working to prevent it. Those folks who support mass immigration, Al Qaeda terrorist attacks against our people here in our country - they will become hated.</p>

		<p>No politician is going to address illegal immigration, and it&rsquo;s a waste of time even talking about it. The only thing that will stop illegals is a very poor American economy, zero jobs, and a totally backrupt government. That will take care of it. It&rsquo;s the only thing. The US will never regain control of the borders, and will no longer tolerate enforcement of the immigration laws.</p>
<p>The only alternate solution I see is state succession. Arizona, Texas, Alaska, and Idaho are good candidates. </p>

So Whites, like me, who paid taxes all their working lives should be cut off? What are you going to do with all the White elderly, then? Starve them?  I was a working mother for 35 years and paid taxes and  am now elderly and social security is all I have to live on.</p>
<p> What would you do? Put millions like me on the streets?  My grown kids are bad off, and do not have enough to live on themselves. One has been disabled for years now.  They cannot support me also. You do know that billions alone is lost in FRAUD every year in medicare and SSA, don&rsquo;t you? Why not do something about that? Why not get all these &#8220;immigrants&#8221; off the rolls? They all bring their parents over here and plop them down on social security and there is no outrage?  </p>
<p>The reason social security is in trouble is because our government STOLE our money and blew it on welfare, etc. for the &#8220;minorities&#8221;, immigrants and their kids, and it is minorities/immigrants that have filled the ranks of the social security rolls for DECADES, most without paying a dime into they system! </p>

		<p>None of the GOP candidates are prizes. They are all weak and ineffective. The only one that is electable is Mitt Romney. (see gallup.com). I am going to vote for him. With a republican victory, I hope we can hold onto our country and dollar for a few more years. In the meantime, I am making arrangements to leave. No place is perfect, but I am looking at Japan, Australia, and Switzerland. If the dollar ever comes back, it will only be temporary. I would then purchase yen or swiss francs. If not, I would purchase local real estate (coastal CA) for awhlle. I would be happy to hear any suggestions.</p>
<p>Whether Obama or Romney wins the next election, that has no bearing on our long term future. The president after that will make these horrible choices look good. In our lifetimes, we will see a Hugo Chavez or Robert Mugabe elected President. Our only hope is a white separatist movement. At this time, I don&rsquo;t see any chance of that. Too few people want to put their beers down and take action.</p>

		<p>Ron Paul opposes illegal immigration but he doesn&rsquo;t go far enough.  He wants to end federal mandates that force states to provided public benefits to illegal aliens, which is good.  But he doesn&rsquo;t want to mandate the use of e-verify because he doesn&rsquo;t think businessmen should have to act like police.  Well, every state has a minimum age for buying alcohol, and bars and liquor stores are required to card people who look like they might be below the legal limit.  Nobody I know regards this as especially onerous or police state like, and everybody knows that if bars and liquor stores didn&rsquo;t card their customers the age limits on buying booze would be completely unenforceable.  Using e-verify isn&rsquo;t much more troublesome than carding a customer, and without it the laws against hiring illegal immigrants have proven to be totally unenforceable.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just as opposed to immigration as the next person. I also see the futility of thinking that anyone in national Government is going to do anything. I&rsquo;ve lived in Texas all my life and I&rsquo;ve seen the destructive changes that all forms of immigration have wrought on the white community and traditional values of this state and the rest of our country. For instance Corsicana, Tx where I live is over run with foreigners from Mexico and other parts of central America along with a thriving community of Hindus, Pakistanis, and Pacific islanders. The Hindus and Pakistanis own most of the motels, convenience stores and liquor stores and gladly hire the Mexicans to work for them. we also have a burgeoning population of disaffected blacks whom the local politicians and churches pamper and coddle. Not to mention that a few of the mainstream churches that were once white and conservative now court mixed congregations and special services for Hispanics. Its even worse in the larger cities with Dallas, which is just north of here, claiming a majority Hispanic population. When you think of economics the rich white people that control most of the political purse strings benefit immensely from the cheap labor. For instance Charles Butt the owner of the largest grocery chain in Texas has come out against the proposed legislation outlawing sanctuary cities since a good portion of the income from his stores comes from that population. Lets face it with big money like that influencing public policy and middle class and moderately wealthy whites declaring they are doing Gods will by championing diversity.</p>
<p>There are several bills sitting in the House Judiciary committee right now that address immigration perhaps only one addresses any of the issues being discussed here and there is little likely hood that it will ever come to the floor for a vote. There are also several gun control bills with huge numbers of sponsors. American politics is an ideological battle ground with large financial interests at stake. Serious change comes only through wise strategy and in a situation like we are in today you have to choose the battles you can win. The problem with positive immigration legislation are that there are very few immigration reform organizations out there with enough clout and financial backing to influence reform.     </p>

<p>This is what Paul said about social security.</p>
<p>First, Congress needs to stop using payroll taxes for purposes not related to Social Security, which was a trick the Clinton administration used to claim balanced budgets.</p>
<p> Second, Congress should eliminate unconstitutional spending – including unnecessary overseas commitments – and use the saved funds to help transition to a Social Security system that is completely voluntary. </p>
<p>At some point in the near future Congress must allow taxpayers to opt out of federal payroll taxes in exchange for never receiving Social Security benefits.<br>

		<p>Lonestar Rebel, your post makes no sense at all.  If immgration/race replacement is not the number one issue for you, what are you doing here?  The 2nd Amendment argument you make is so silly and full of holes, I don&rsquo;t know where to start.  Right now, no Democratic president can do anything about gun control because pro-gun forces are way too strong in the Legislature(you know, the people who make the laws).  There is no danger of the Second Amendment being trampled at the Federal level anytime soon no matter who gets in the White House.  What WILL cause the eventual election of a Congress that would pass harsh gun control laws is the continued immigration of Hispanics and other non-whites, whether it be legal or illegal.  We&rsquo;re still at the point where whites are such a large percentage of voters that a GOP candidate can easily win the presidency with NO Hispanic votes.  In recent elections, something like 90% of the GOP&rsquo;s total votes have come from whites.  </p>
<p>Can someone from Texas please explain to me why Texas whites are so soft on immigration compared to other Southerners?  <br>

		<p>I hate to sound jaded, but the sad truth is that, in the end, the candidates that would really be our best hope will never get elected. The ones that are not in the establishment elite (Paul and Bachmann)ultimately have no chance. During the last election, when Ron Paul was still alive and kicking in the debates, the media completely ignored him and never even mentioned he was still in the race. They only talked about McCain. Any &#8220;Anti-Establishment&#8221; candidate will not get a fair shake.. We are TOLD what to think and what ISSUES are the important issues by the media and the interests  who control the media and our country. Just listen to the questions that citizens ask candidates in open forums: &#8220;what are you going to do about education?&#8221;, &#8220;What about Social Security and Medicare?&#8221; &#8220;What about Healthcare?&#8221; We are spoon fed what to think and we regurgitate it back to our masters like good little boys and girls. These issues are DISTRACTIONS to keep us focused away from the rapid demise of our nation. All of the big name Republican candidates, i.e. Romney, Perry, Gingrich will NOT put us back on the road to true a true Republic. They are establishment shills and we will have more of the same in a different candy wrapper. But, Ron Paul has no chance. If Bachmann was a liberal, the press would trumpet her name across the land. But she is very conservative and they want to rip her apart. I would love to see Ron Paul, or Tancredo or Bachmann but they have NO CHANCE and I am sad to say it. It will either be Perry or Romney and they will hand America over to the Globalists lock stock and barrel.</p>

		<p>I agree with those who mentioned Tancredo as what the country needs right now.<br>
Unfortunately, the media as well as his fellow republicans portray him as an unhinged far right lunatic.<br>
I think alot has changed in four years where a Tancredo can gain some traction among the Tea Party types, but would still be marginalized by the powers that be as nothing more that a curious out-of-touch novelty. <br>

		<p>Did anyone read the top 10 reasons NOT to vote for Perry? He is just another traitor. As for Romney, no thanks.</p>
<p>This is the reason Obama won in the first place. The GOP putting up wimps as the republican candidates. Just look at Juan McCain who could not win a turtle fight. My cat would have been a better nominee.</p>
<p>Looks like I will vote for the Constitution Party again or else a WHITE Party if one happens to come along. A wasted vote, you say? The way I see it ALL my votes were wasted by voting for the REPUBS in the last several decades. Reagan with his amnesty and the drug running Oliver North &#8220;contra affair&#8221;.  Look what both Bush&rsquo;s brought us. Papa with his vision of the One World Order and Jr. with his never ending wars in the M.E.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Walls work. Ask the Israelis.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Israeli &#8220;separation barrier&#8221; works, it&rsquo;s because the Israelis WANT it to work. The WILL is there and that&rsquo;s the most important thing. If the Israeli barrier fails, it will be due to purely human and political reasons, not some failure in engineering. </p>
<p>Walls can be built, but the human factor is critical to their security. The Great Wall of China didn&rsquo;t keep the Mongols out because SOMEONE LET THEM IN, probably one of the tribes who were supposed to be defending part of the wall. The Mongols just marched through one of the gates and the same thing would happen here.</p>
<p>A US/Mexico border wall would be almost 2000 miles long with at least 42 border-crossing checkpoints, most of them guarded by the Border Patrol or HSA agents and the like, all under the control of the US federal government, well known for its incorruptibility and its competence in security matters. That&rsquo;s a recipe for failure. </p>
<p>&#8220;But then the USG has no intention of protecting White lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a US wall would fail. If the WILL existed to build a wall to defend the border, then the wall itself wouldn&rsquo;t even be required. The technical issues involved in building a wall are irrelevant. The human factor is everything. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Can someone from Texas please explain to me why Texas whites are so soft on immigration compared to other Southerners? &#8220;</p>
<p>Cheap, cheap labor and totally obedient voting blocks.  As soon as the Texans seperated from Mexico they began bringing in Mexican peons in preference to White or black workers.</p>
<p>Except for the oil industry, Texas has made all its money from Mexican peon labor since 1836.</p>

		<p>Have Bachmann, Ron Paul or any other conservative ever said anything about ending affirmative action, black on White crime, ending tax deductible contributions to non profits that are always, always taken over by anti White commie groups and restoring 14th amendment rights to Whites.</p>
<p>I am sure amreners are sick and tired of reading my diatribes about this but:</p>
<p>White nationalism has nothing to do with conservative causes. </p>
<p>The anti abortion, anti gay pro christian, pro Israel, pro American military, anti union, anti welfare, and Patriotic organizations have never, never done anything to help White nationalists.</p>
<p>They never will.  They will take our votes and enact more and more anti White laws.</p>

<p>This is what Paul said about social security. </p>
<p>At some point in the near future Congress must allow taxpayers to opt out of federal payroll taxes in exchange for never receiving Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>This is just a ploy to privatize retirement accounts.  Bush was in favor of it too.  People would opt out of social security and put $200 to $400 per month into a retirement account.  The wicked wolves of Wall street would steal the retirement money.</p>
<p>So we would end up with millions of elderly who had no social security and no private retirement money.</p>

		<p>3) Put a moratorium on legal immigration,</p>

<p>Thank you so much anonymous Indian.  We have about 225 million Whites in this country.  There must be millions of Whites with IQs of 110 and up with stamina and good study habits who are perfectly capable of becoming nurses.</p>
<p>Yet we are importing thousands of third world nurses, many with extremely dubious credentials every year while denying native born American Whites admission to nursing school.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just nursing.  Every possible occupation is overwhelmed by non White foreigners while Whites are banned from employment by our own goverment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I hate to sound jaded, but the sad truth is that, in the end, the candidates that would really be our best hope will never get elected. The ones that are not in the establishment elite (Paul and Bachmann)ultimately have no chance. &#8220;</p>
<p>Then we need to withhold our support and make the GOP lose until they choose candidates we like.  This is how nationalist voters in several European countries forced the mainstream right-wing parties  to adopt anti-immigration policies.  </p>

		<p>Here is something from vdare.com about Republicans who re jsut as much the enemies of Whites as Democrats.</p>
<p>(1) not ONE Republican contender appears to have commented on President Obama&rsquo;s Friday announcement of a de facto amnesty;  </p>
<p>(2) not ONE Republican contender has commented on Obama&rsquo;s Thursday executive order imposing more &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; i.e. a Chicago-type race-based spoils system on the federal workforce, already disproportionately non-white;  </p>
<p>(3) Texas governor Rick Perry reaffirmed his support for a &ldquo;path to citizenship&rdquo; for illegal aliens; in-state college tuition rates for illegal aliens; and opposition to Arizona-type law sanctions on illegal aliens. It&rsquo;s not clear that Perry knew what he was saying &mdash; but not ONE Republican contender has criticized him.</p>

		<p>Rick Perry has been invited to it, and has showed up, so it&rsquo;s definitely fair game, the discussion of this Bildeberg Group.</p>
<p>My understanding is that it&rsquo;s mostly a self-promotion society for the world&rsquo;s government and business elite.  If that&rsquo;s all it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with it.  If all that happened at Bildeberg meetings was David Rockefeller giving David Cameron back rubs, then the Bildeberg meetings would matter to me no more than a convention of trebuchet manufacturers.  However, it is often the case that major shifts in governments&rsquo; policies, including our own, happen after these confabs, almost always for the worse.  That&rsquo;s when and why it matters to me, and it should to everyone else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start thinking of the Bildebergers as something positive when they (A) Invite Jared Taylor, (B) Listen to what he has to say, and (C) Follow through when they get home.  Until then, I&rsquo;ll have to go on the assumption that they&rsquo;re the usual globalist/capitalist types who believe the &#8220;our diversity is our strength&#8221; mantra.</p>

Paul and Bachmann have no chance. Gov. Romney hopefully will win the nomination because he&rsquo;s the only person on this list who can beat Obama in the general. Does Perry have a chance? Perhaps, but very unlikely. First reason, were talking about another president from Texas. There&rsquo;s still a lot of people (conservative and independent) in this country that are still upset with GW for his little eight years spending spree. When Perry made his announcement for the presidential nomination, there were a heck of a lot of people from Texas that were very unhappy with his decision. I know, I live in this Great State and I&rsquo;m one of them. Here we go again, our state will catch all this bad criticism from these liberals like tingle leg chris-matthews because we have a Governor who needs an over sized hat. Look, Governor Perry not perfect, the way he&rsquo;s enforce our immigration laws in Texas is not good and I have no reason to think that would change. Now, having said that I&rsquo;m not a big fan of Perry, Perry&rsquo;s not John McCain. To all of you people who say they will vote for Obama before they vote for Perry? Perhaps you should stop smoking what ever it is your smoking long enough to take a look at the world around you. </p>

		<p>I just got an email back from a real estate agent in San Mateo County Ca.</p>
<p>I saw a small apartment house on the internet and emailed him asking for information about the interiors and projected property taxes after transfer of title.</p>
<p>We emailed back and forth.  Then I sent him an email telling him that I was really worried about the effect of California demographics on property values.</p>
<p>Half the state is hispanic minimum wage workers and welfare receipients.  More and more are pouring in every day. </p>
<p>The whole 1960 to 2005 housing boom was predicated on the fact that people with solid middle class incomes would be around to buy real estate that was being sold. Given the low incomes of half the population will present housing values hold or will the apartment house be worth half of what I pay for it in 15 years.</p>
<p>He emailed me back that that is exactly what all the real estate people think.  Soon there just will not be enough middle class people in California to keep prices at their present level.</p>
<p>Something to think about.  The minority mortgages disguised the low incomes of the California population for a decade.  But now the real estate market is facing the facts of White flight and low wage and welfare hispanic indian takeover of the state.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an anti immigrant activist.  The real estate agent has an MBA and is in a manager position.  We both have the same worries about California real estate.</p>
<p>What with paying 20 to 30 years of interest, property taxes improvements and maintainence the only way home owners make money is when they sell.  If you sell the house after 10 or 20 years for less than the cost of interest, property taxes and maintaince you have lost all that money.</p>
<p>Something to think about.</p>

<p>If Perry were to beat Obama, it would set the cause of immigration restriction back and ensure the open borders crowd would control the GOP for at least another four years.  If Perry were to lose, especially if large numbers of conservatives made of point letting the world know that they were staying home because of Perry&rsquo;s immigration views, that would help the GOP to embrace immigration restriction.  Don&rsquo;t you understand that?  This is simple stuff.  </p>
<p>Why are white people so bad at political strategy?  This stuff comes naturally to many other groups.</p>

The Bilderberg Group is quite an interesting cabal. They meet at the finest hotels, import their own waitstaff and employees during their meetings. They are totally secretive. No press coverage is allowed. Leaked information from their meetings have shown that they are the power brokers, a &#8220;who&rsquo;s who&#8221; of world leaders, financiers and monarchs who meet to discuss world affairs. What is scary is that much of what they discuss seems to get implemented into the respective governments they represent as policy. The mere fact that they are shrouded in secrecy causes me alarm. What is there to hide? &#8220;Bring your deeds into the light.&#8221; I don&rsquo;t view them as benign. They, and their ilk, view us as serfs.

Perry can&rsquo;t beat Obama, that&rsquo;s my point! This is Not just immigration. &#8216;Look at the BIG Picture&rsquo;&hellip;. Making Obama a one-term president. The odds will be stacked against whichever Republican wins the presidential nomination and anyone who thinks Obama will be easy to beat in the general is delusional. &#8220;You don&rsquo;t beat presidents easily. &#8220;Obama will have no primary opponent and he will start this race with a billion dollars. &#8216;That&rsquo;s a BILLION DOLLARS!! The independent vote, ask always will be the difference. People who call themselves independent voters are middle of the road liberals. Perry can&rsquo;t pull these people, he&rsquo;s to far-right. Romney appeals to the independent voter. Big fan of Romney? No Way, but I&rsquo;m looking for someone who can beat Obama, and for me&hellip;.&ldquo;There is only one person out there who can beat Obama, and that&rsquo;s Romney. </p>
