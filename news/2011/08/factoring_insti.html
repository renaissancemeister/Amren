<h1><a href="http://www.wrn.com/2011/07/factoring-institutional-racism-into-infant-mortality/">Factoring Institutional Racism into Infant Mortality</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Moon, Wisconsin Radio Network, July 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Institutional racism is a reason why African-American babies die at a higher rate than white children, according to a Marquette University Nursing Professor. Clinical Instructor Kelli Jones says we can&rsquo;t be afraid to look at racism as a cause for the disparity.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of what I&rsquo;m talking about is looking even deeper at before we even get to that point how can we reduce infant mortality?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones advocates for long term health care  &mdash;  including Ob/Gyn  &mdash;  for women regardless of whether or not they are planning to get pregnant.  However she cites inadequate Medicaid reimbursement is leading to doctors treating fewer low income patients.</p>
<p>African-American babies in Wisconsin are 3-to-4 times more likely to die before their first birthday than white infants.</p>

<p>I can understand her point.  I read all the time in the news about six-month old black babies who apply for jobs and mortgages and apartments, who are flat out denied and told to their faces that that it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re black.</p>

		<p>This excuse is used so often that any responding agency probably has a boilerplate form that&rsquo;s handed to the press!  <br>
No poor American is unable to get prenatal health care.  There are free clinics in cities, and Medicaid covers necessary payments both for welfare recipients and those receiving very low wages.  Moreover, there are, in numbers, more poor whites than poor blacks.  If health care is being denied because of cost, low-income whites would suffer as well.  <br>
As in most liberal articles, this one presents a premise and then makes an argument that clearly refutes the premise!</p>

		<p>Uh, then maybe those African-American mothers ought to get educations and get a jobs with benefits, instead of expecting the American taxpayers to foot the bill for their 14 children.  Better yet, stop having children you can&rsquo;t afford.  This country would be better off with fewer parasites.</p>

		<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s racism OF COURSE, not because of drug-taking while pregnant, not going to the doctor, being too young, eating whatever they please instead of what the developing baby needs, having zero parenting skills (nor the discipline to sacrifice their wants for the babies&rsquo; needs). </p>

		<p>Why not do a more accurate comparison by comparing black infant mortality rates in Africa and America? <br>
Compare everything from income to life expectancy rates between black Africa and black America.<br>
Compare the welfare payment amounts of black Africans to black Americans. <br>
There has never been a study to prove how much better blacks in America have to blacks in Africa and this should be conducted. That would be a great project for thousands of black college programs and their hundred of billions they are paid rather than waste on their usual garbage projects. <br>
We know even though such a comparison would be of immense valuable information this is one area that will never be touched in a million years for obvious reasons and any attempt to do so would label you are the worst racist on the planet. <br>

		<p>This is what you get when a group attempts to half-heartedly mimick the successful behaviors of the one group who established and subsequently maintains a given society. So, what is the solution here, a soft call for a new &#8216;white man&rsquo;s burden&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that despite out-reproducing Whites per capita, Blacks are still victims of institutional &#8220;reproductive racism&#8221;?    And Blacks are out-breeding Whites despite having much higher abortion rates than Whites.</p>
<p>Back to reality.  What are the real causes of the differences in infant mortality rates?</p>
<p>First, the vast majority of Black women do not breastfeed.  They see it as something only poor people do.  Infant formula is seen as a status symbol.  Without proper breastfeeding, newborns fail to get the much needed immune system boost the naturally occurs in mother&rsquo;s milk.  And many of the infant formulas on the market are soy-based, which have been shown to cause developmental problems.</p>
<p>Second, Black women have much higher rates of substance abuse during and after pregnancy.  This leads to lapses in critical child-caring responsibilities.</p>
<p>Third, Black children are far more likely to die violent deaths at the hands of parents, &#8220;care-givers&#8221;, live-in boyfriends, etc.</p>
<p>Are these three factors caused by &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;?  A Marxist, predictably, says yes, of course.  Which begs the question: So when are Blacks ever responsible for the outcome of their lives?  Never, as long as there are White people with shake-down money to blame.  Where is the &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; in Africa that causes such high infant mortality rates?  Ummm&hellip;..</p>

		<p>&#8220;However she cites inadequate Medicaid reimbursement is leading to doctors treating fewer low income patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words gimme gimme gimme.</p>
<p>Her bio shows she graduated from Marquette and stays there as staff now teaching &#8220;Community Health Nursing.&#8221;<br>
She&rsquo;s a fraud that would never be able to cut it in an actual nursing position and took the comfy AA way out.<br>
I&rsquo;m sure Marquette, which is as insanely liberal as a university can get, had no problem pushing this unqualified loser along with admission credits, easy course lists for GE requirements etc.<br>

		<p><i>African-American babies in Wisconsin are 3-to-4 times more likely to die before their first birthday than white infants.</i></p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t say.  Were the following factored in?</p>
<p>How many of those black infants died due to child abuse, neglect or murder?</p>
<p>How about this FACT:  Abuse rates run 17 per 1,000 in black children compared to only 9 in 1,000 white children. </p>
<p>Illegitimacy in the black community runs ~ 70-80 % :  living with a single parent and a live-in boyfriend increases the risk of abuse and neglect to more than eight times that of other children</p>
<p>Data published by the USDHHS show the rate of infant homicide for blacks is 2 per 10,000, compared with 0.6 per 10,000 for whites.  Blacks have four-and-a-half times the infant homicide rate of whites.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t hold your breath that the msm or Clinical Instructor Kelli Jones will tell you these FACTS. Ms. Jones needs to toe the PC line to keep her job and the msm&rsquo;s goal is to destroy whites.  Therefore, the ONLY plausible answer to the disparity in white vs. black infant deaths is racism.  </p>
<p>Case Closed.</p>

		<p>Wow. That racism sure is terrible. It&rsquo;s just amazing why blacks keep moving to white nations with all that terrible racism. Whites should do the right thing and separate themselves physically from all blacks and let them build their own society.</p>

		<p>It seems more like institutional stupidity and low IQ to me. </p>
<p>This is such a lame excuse to shift blame and responsibility it&rsquo;s sickening.</p>
<p>First, to blame low Medicaid reimbursement is essentially saying, &#8220;No one be willing to pays for my care&#8221; and &#8220;I be so dumb I needs somebody to tell me what&rsquo;s to eat and nots smoke da crack.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have a patient population of uneducated, unhealthy, genetically brainless, dysfunctional living, underage infection carriers wondering why they have a high infant mortality rate. </p>
<p>Jones, meanwhile, is an idiot. Instead of spending her time trying to fix the clinical issues she runs around screaming racism. On top of that she wants even more taxpayer money for &#8220;long-term&#8221; care - like that will fix the underlying pathologies. People like her - a racist nurse with a big mouth and a small frontal lobe - should be fired for wasting everyone&rsquo;s time and money. Her head is screwed on backwards.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve given enough money to help these cretins perpetuate a failed gene pool. There&rsquo;s no money left. They have wasted it all.</p>
<p>Take some personal responsibility - white people have no more will to give.</p>

		<p>I looked at the profile of Nurse Ratchet that 6 Anon above provided.  I noticed one of the classes she teaches is a &#8220;theory&#8221; class.  When did nursing become a theoretical pursuit?  I always thought nurses actually did something with patients, I never knew the medical profession had any room for theoretical nurses.  Maybe it&rsquo;s part of the &#8220;those who can do those who can&rsquo;t teach&#8221; ethos.</p>
<p>It also says that her &#8220;real world&#8221; nursing has been in public health.  Dime to a donut says that the riskiest thing she has ever done medically is administer flu shots.</p>
<p>Her publication history seems to be limited to one newspaper op-ed, and relaying some stories some expecting and postpartum black women have told her about their being depressed.  Plus I guess this stellar commentary for the Wisconsin Public Radio Network could eventually count if someone wrote it down.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Al Sharpton in a scrub suit.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, and this is a bit of an OT rant, it is my opinion that a majority of people who work in the medical profession that wear scrub suits don&rsquo;t need to wear them, and that they&rsquo;re only made to wear them as some sort of self-esteem sop, i.e. &#8220;look at me, I&rsquo;m wearing the same uniform as a brain surgeon or a cardiac surgery nurse does while they&rsquo;re doing surgery.&#8221;  The major hospital complex in St. Louis from which I get most of my health care is really bad about this   &mdash;   The clinic nurses wear scrubs (why should the nurse for my endocrinologist wear a scrub suit?), the clinic receptionists wear scrubs, (I never knew handing phone calls required scrubbing in), the people that register you for lab work and x-rays wear scrubs, the orderlies and &#8220;go-fors&#8221; wear scrubs, and even the cafeteria clerks wear scrubs.  If the security guards didn&rsquo;t need to carry guns, they&rsquo;d be wearing scrubs, too, I suppose.    </p>
