			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Oliver Pickup, Daily Mail (London), August 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 16-year-old boy killed a pensioner with a single punch as he tried to put out fires during the London riots, a court heard.</p>
<p>Onlookers pleaded &#8216;no, no, he&rsquo;s an old man&rsquo; as a teenager wearing a T-shirt with the slogan &#8216;Robbers and Villains&rsquo; attacked. </p>
<p>Richard Mannington Bowes, 68, was punched in the face as he tried to extinguish a blaze near his home in Ealing, West London.</p>
<p>The force of the blow caused him to fall over smashing his head on the pavement. He died three days later on August 11 from the injuries he sustained.</p>
<p>A 16-year-old boy has been charged with Mr Bowes&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>The Crown Prosecution Service also charged the Hounslow-based teenager  &mdash;  unidentified for legal reasons  &mdash;  with violent disorder as well as four counts of burglary.</p>
<p>They related to looting at a William Hill bookmakers, a Tesco Express, a Blockbusters video shop and a Fatboys restaurant.</p>
<p>The chubby teenager appeared in the dock in a black T-shirt with his arms folded. He did not enter a plea to the charges. </p>
<p>District Judge Robert Hunter refused bail and ordered him to appear on Thursday at the Old Bailey. </p>
<p>The 16-year-old&rsquo;s mother, sat next to him in the dock at Croydon Magistrate&rsquo;s Court wearing a grey and pink tracksuit.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old is charged with perverting the course of justice.</p>
<p>She cannot be named as it would  identify her son.</p>
<p>Outlining the case against the teenage boy, prosecutor John Gardner said: &#8216;These matters go to August 8 and the area being Ealing Broadway in west London.</p>
<p>&#8216;The circumstances are that Richard Mannington Bowes lived in the area, he was 68, and during the disturbances that were taking place in that area around Spring Bridge Road he was seen to walk from his home address toward the shopping area.</p>
<p>&#8216;On Spring Bridge Road there is a hump back bridge and there was a stand off between 60 and 70 youths who were attacking police officers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bowes was seen walking along the road from his house toward the shopping centre by witnesses as trouble flared between the youths and the police.</p>
<p>Mr Gardner continued: &#8216;Fires had been lit and missiles were being thrown. It was during this period of time around 10.30pm the Mr Bowes was spotted going over to a bin which had been set alight.</p>
<p>&#8216;It would seem he was trying to extinguish the fire in the bin when he was challenged by a number of people who came from the crowd.  </p>
<p>&#8216;At this point he is punched in the face and falls backwards striking his head on the road surface. He remained completely motionless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Bowes never regained conciousness after the blow and died three days later.  </p>
<p>CCTV evidence showed a teenager, believed to be the same youth, wearing a jumper saying &#8216;Robbers and Villians&rsquo; that evening.</p>
<p>Mr Gardner added: &#8216;There is a recording of voices being heard at the time saying &#8220;What the **** are you doing, no no, he is an old man&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8216;Clearly this is a voice recording from the attack on Mr Bowes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The judge said: &#8216;I am satisfied from what I have heard to the nature of the allegations that a secure remand is necessary in order to protect the public from serious harm.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The 16-year-old was taken down as his mother&rsquo;s case was heard, with neither saying a word but exchanging glances. </p>
<p>Mr Gardner said the case against the mother came after police visited her home and she admitted to disposing of clothing. </p>
<p>She was also refused bail and will appear alongside her son at the Old Bailey. </p>
<p>Mr Bowes, who lived alone in Haven Green, Ealing, was placed on a life-support machine following the attack, which took place as violence spread through the capital.</p>
<p>On Saturday night around 100 people attended a vigil organised by churches in Ealing in Mr Bowes&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>It came a day after Ealing Council flew the Union Flag over its town hall at half-mast as a mark of respect.</p>
<p>Mr Bowes&rsquo;s sister Anne Wilderspin said she was devastated at the violent nature of her brother&rsquo;s death. </p>
<p>Mrs Wilderspin, 73, said: &#8216;We were able to spend some time with him before he died and we asked the hospital chaplain to give a short service. </p>
<p>&#8216;He was obviously badly injured and wouldn&rsquo;t survive  &mdash;  we realised that when we saw him.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s very sad, it would have been wonderful to be able to talk with him but that was not meant to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Wilderspin lives in Matlock, Derbyshire with her husband Michael and said she never thought her family would be affected by the four days of riots in the capital.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;Before I found out it was him, I&rsquo;d read that a 68-year-old man had been injured in the riots in Ealing but it didn&rsquo;t occur to me that it was my own brother. It took some time to sink in. It felt unreal.</p>
<p>&#8216;Richard is a hero. He took action to stop things from happening and paid for it with his life.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I guess the unintended consequences of multiculturalism in Britain is taking quite a toll on the indigenous population.  I can only drum up a small amount of sympathy/empathy for whites who have allowed their nations - including the U.S. - to be overrun with third worlders, socialists, and communists.  Their backbones as well as their voices have been ridiculed out of them.  They walk and talk like programmed robots.  And, it is because today&rsquo;s whites are so easily manipulated with words and labels.</p>
<p>The Labour Party has been dominant in Britain for decades and the idiots still haven&rsquo;t learned.  Cameron will win re-election!  And one of our two major political parties will win in 2012.  Ron Paul is our only salvation but most of us don&rsquo;t have a clue.<br>

<p>It appears that the British legal system are playing the same game as our own - that of protecting dangerous and violent taxpayer supported predator criminals so they might unleash these &#8220;anonymous&#8221; Thugs back onto the community. It&rsquo;s a safe bet that, like our own &#8220;justice&#8221; system, all they are doing is teaching little Thugs to be even more dangerous big Thugs -were that only possible. </p>
<p>Thank goodness this murderer&rsquo;s Thug mom is also in court. She will be able to vouch what a good boy her Thug son is.</p>

		<p>What a shame England voluntarily gave up their right to bear arms. Now the law-abiding citizens have no choice but to resort to clubs or other means of self protection, but the punks and thugs still have guns and knives. Mr. Richard M. Bowes would probably still be alive if he had a gun. Still a hero but alive!May he rest in peace.</p>
<p>For all their put-downs of the US, and I know we have more than our share of problems, I wouldn&rsquo;t live there if paid to. Their looney left is hundred times worse than ours! Imagine not being legally allowed to protect one&rsquo;s self. They even stopped the sale of baseball bats online, while their sorry excuse for whoever is supposed to be running the place took their sweet time mobilizing the police. And when the race of some of the people trying to protect their neighborhoods were white, they were labeled &#8220;right-wing extremists&#8221; and &#8220;vigilante patrols&#8221; while asians doing the same were referred to as &#8220;just defending their property&#8221; or &#8220;men of honor&#8221;.</p>
<p>The racism shown to whites by England&rsquo;s media is probably worse than ours, or at least a tie. Twisted and disgusting. But at least I have the right to carry a gun. And will continue to always fight for that right. Stories like these are the reason why.</p>

		<p>It is not mentioned that the police had to fight off a mob of 100 or so assailants just to allow the medics to treat the man on the scene and get him away in an ambulance.</p>
<p>Each and everyone of that mob contributed to the death of Mr. Bowes.</p>
<p>And not just he was an old man, to that &#8220;youf&#8221; he was AN OLD WHITE MAN AND FAIR GAME!!</p>
<p>And look at that image of the 16 year old as he is being led away. Hide your face moron and hide your butt too. What does that say!! Evil villain - - your own T-shirt speak volumes. 16 year old totally worthless and useless human and always will be!! Garbage to be thrown out with the trash.</p>

		<p>What is not being mentioned here is the fact these non-white insurrectionsts and terrorists are probably using brass knuckles. One punch from a brass knuckle wielder can easily kill any man, one good blow to the temple can kill a man on the spot. It is for that reason brass knuckles are illegal in many jurisdictions in the U.S.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always hated this sort of dialogue and here&rsquo;s why;</p>
<p>First, there is a fatalistic determination about it, as if nothing could have prevented what happened as if it is preplanned, something that I completely reject because that demands that we have no free will.</p>
<p>Second, because it represents the acceptance of the condition. Listen to her, she is accepting what happened. This, I think is the result of a deep seated, Christian culture that denies any recourse but to suffer.  Our enemies love that and find it useful.</p>
<p>Most whites need a big dope slap.</p>

		<p>When I read about some white person that lives in a liberal area (thus likely a liberal) that is victimized. I wonder what this guy would have thought if the victim was me instead of him. Would he have been happy that a southern redneck got what he deserved? Would he think that is the unfortunate price we have to pay for diversity or flippenltly think that is what those whites deserve.Basically is this a race traitor that was killed by the animal he wanted to release on us. <br>
I wrestled with this a lot in the Duke Lacrosse story.<br>
What would those priveledged boys think if he rape charge would have been against a KA Frat at University of Memphis?  <br>
Would they have been vocal in their denouncing racism and the plight of the poor black? Would they celebrate the imprisonment of the boys (that could not afford the legal team that saved their bacon?Would they have supported a Tennessee Prosocutor named Wilfong?<br>
Right now I hope Richard Bowes family is comforted and receives justce, but would they feel likewise about me?  </p>

I dont like 14 yr, old being hung every second Tuesday, but come on, England&rsquo;s a joke. Great mighty Albion, half of a small island, yet the whole world speaks their language.

		<p>17 GWS,</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re dead wrong.  He is NOT for amnesty and has stated it many, many times including during last week&rsquo;s debate!  Just like people say he is going to end social security and medicare.  He says he is not going to deny benefits for people that have paid into them.  He wants to get younger generations on to a plan that is a retirement/savings plan and not an entitlement program.  The elites do a good job vilifying him and it tends to work real good on the masses.</p>
<p>There is a lot of disinformation about him.  I do disagree with him on visas but he is the candidate all white nationalists/realists should be voting for!<br>

		<p>People are really delusional if they think that the UK&rsquo;s problems are worse than ours.  They are at least 85% white, we are just over 60% white.  </p>
<p>In the UK the right wing party has promised to drastically cut immigration.  In the US, the right wing party can&rsquo;t even unite against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>In the UK, the mainstream press regularly mentions racial differences in crime rates and covers anti-white attacks like this. In the US, racial differences in crime rates are unmentionable and anti-white attacks are covered up.  </p>

		<p>Superior civilization.<br>
Superior numbers.<br>
Superior resources.<br>
Superior brains.<br>
Superior work ethic.</p>
<p>The only way the White holders of western civilization can lose this race war is if we don&rsquo;t organize and fight back. Our own inaction is the only thing holding us back. The Other is inferior in every martial metric except aggression; possibly because violence comes naturally to them, probably they are too stupid to understand what they are messing with. </p>
<p>Civilization requires effort &amp; work. It requires dedicated activity, not just hanging around the internet while looters are burning the shops down the street. Really talk with your friends &amp; family, neighbors &amp; associates. We are all concerned about the effects of unlimited Third World immigration. The great thing about Productive People is everybody has skills. Learn &amp; share and become stronger. We must organize to defend our civilization from attack by violent, parasitical, entitled Others.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is an Establishment Movement. Forget about the establishment politicians, they are enacting your demise. Become new ones. Forget about the establishment media, they are enabling the Establishment propaganda. Turn off the TV &amp; teach your children well. The Elites &amp; their imported Goons are enemies of civilization itself; one loots from above, the other below. Forget about looking good on TV. Expect criticism and slander. Remember there are more important things than being popular in an image-consuming society.</p>
<p>Remember your grandfathers and your great-grandfathers and learn what they stood &amp; fought for. Determine to ally yourself with others of the Faith, &amp; stand together, bringing Justice upon the Looters. </p>
<p>Our civilization is our strength. Our will is our Power. Our action is our Victory.  <br>

		<p>He&rsquo;s right, it IS social injustice in the UK - its truly unfair to the average loafer like him! </p>
<p>Why, I read recently that the British gov&rsquo;t was subsidizing a Somali family with 7 children and unemployed parents in a mansion with a rent of ~13k pounds/month. Meanwhile, the average unemployed lout like this guy will only get ~30k pounds/yr from the gov&rsquo;t in Britain. Why should the Somali guy get a mansion for being lazy, and he only get 30k?</p>
