<p>Nick Miroff, Washington Post, August 21, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Of all the strange circumstances surrounding the violent abduction last year of Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, the Mexican power broker and former presidential candidate known here as &#8220;Boss Diego,&#8221; perhaps nothing was weirder than the mysterious tracking chip that the kidnappers allegedly cut from his body.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a recent Mexican congressional report, kidnappings have jumped 317 percent in the past five years. More alarming, perhaps, is the finding that police officers or soldiers were involved in more than one-fifth of the crimes, contributing to widespread perceptions that authorities can&rsquo;t be trusted to solve the crimes or recover missing loved ones.</p>
<p>Under-the-skin devices such as the one allegedly carved out of Boss Diego are selling here for thousands of dollars on the promise that they can help rescuers track down kidnapping victims. Xega, the Mexican company that sells the chips and performs the implants, says its sales have increased 40 percent in the past two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s been good for business but bad for the country,&#8221; said Xega executive Diego Kuri, referring to the kidnappings. &#8220;Thirty percent of our clients arrive after someone in their family has already experienced a kidnapping,&#8221; added Kuri, interviewed at the company&rsquo;s heavily fortified offices, opposite a tire shop in this industrial city 120 miles north of Mexico&rsquo;s capital.</p>
<p>Xega calls it the VIP package. For $2,000 upfront and annual fees of $2,000, the company provides clients with a subdermal radio-frequency identification chip (RFID), essentially a small antenna in a tiny glass tube. The chip, inserted into the fatty tissue of the arm between the shoulder and elbow, is less than half an inch long and about as wide as a strand of boiled spaghetti.</p>
<p>{snip} The company says it has helped rescue 178 clients in the past decade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s pure science fiction-a sham-say RIFD researchers and engineers in the United States. Any device that could communicate with satellites or even the local cellular network would need a battery and sizable antenna, like a cellphone, they say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The development of an RFID human implant that could work as a tracking device remains far off, said Justin Patton, managing director of the University of Arkansas RFID Research Center, which specializes in product and merchandise tracking for retail companies such as Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s no way in the world something that size can communicate with a satellite,&#8221; Patton said. &#8220;I have expensive systems with batteries on board, and even they can&rsquo;t be read from a distance greater than a couple hundred meters, with no interference in the way.&#8221; Water is a major barrier for radio frequency, he added, and because the human body is mostly made up of water, it would dull the signal, as would metal, concrete and other solid materials.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several other Mexican companies also sell GPS-enabled tracking units with panic buttons, relying on more-proven forms of technology. The transmitters, smaller than a cellphone, can fit on a key chain, and they work by communicating with cellular networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demand is huge right now,&#8221; said Guillermo Medina, director of Max4Systems, which sells the devices for $200, with a $20 basic monthly fee. &#8220;Our sales are increasing 20 to 25 percent every month.&#8221;</p>
