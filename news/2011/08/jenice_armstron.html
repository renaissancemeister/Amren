			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philly, August 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The problem of Philadelphia&rsquo;s violent teen mobs is the biggest hot-button issue of the summer and one that Charles A. Williams III, an educational psychologist and director of the Center for the Prevention of School-Aged Violence, has been spending a lot of time thinking about lately. He sat down with me last week for a wide-ranging conversation that touched on Mayor Nutter, juvenile curfews and hip-hop.</p>
<p>Jen: Someone needs to open a can of whoop-ass on flash-mob hooligans, right?</p>
<p>Charles: They really need a hug more than an ass-whipping. That&rsquo;s going to be my new campaign, &#8220;Hugs, not ass-whippings.&#8221;</p>
<p>The toughest kid is always the biggest baby and the one always in need of love and a hug. They tend to be smarter than you think  &mdash;  more aware than you think and more malleable.</p>
<p>Jen: Yeah, but when you read about random beatdowns and thefts, you forget that.</p>
<p>Charles: The research says you&rsquo;ve got to be careful about corporal punishment, because it can teach kids that violence is a solution, and it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Charles: What are they really missing? Positive role models. The black family is in worse shape than it has ever been &hellip; because family today is an option. It wasn&rsquo;t in the past. You&rsquo;ve got baby mamas, baby dads, kids raising themselves. I&rsquo;m driving home at night at 1 o&rsquo;clock in the morning from doing what young adults do and I&rsquo;ve got 9-, 10-, 11-year-olds cutting me off on a bike or just walking. &#8220;Where the hell are you coming from? Who let you out at night?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jen: A lot of folks assume flash mobs have something to do with race, but I don&rsquo;t hear them saying the same thing about rioting in London.</p>
<p>Charles: It&rsquo;s racial to the point that you&rsquo;re talking about poor black kids who want attention. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s racial. A disproportionate number of them are suffering economically, socially, politically, spiritually  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s racial &hellip; but if you look at what&rsquo;s happening in London, it&rsquo;s a community of people in need. It&rsquo;s, like, b  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash; , pay attention to me. And if you won&rsquo;t, then &#8220;I&rsquo;ve got something for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jen: What about the curfew for teens?</p>
<p>Charles: I like that. Some people don&rsquo;t&hellip; . If [the flash-mobs thing] starts during the school year, I&rsquo;m going to tell the mayor to make it 7 o&rsquo;clock.</p>

		<p>Maybe they need a hug and attention   &mdash;   when they were younger from their MIA parents.  But now its too late, while coddling and hugging is being theorized, real people are being hurt.  Hello, London is burning and you want to hug them?  <br>
  <br>
I can only hope you meet a gang of pumped-up hateful black kids while alone during the next riot.  Don&rsquo;t forget to give them a hug. If you are lucky you may survive.  How arrogant and out of touch can one be.</p>

		<p>I vote for the a## whippings, not hugs.  Most of these mahogany mobsters are doing what they&rsquo;re doing partially because they&rsquo;ve been coddled and their previous misbehavior excused or rationalized all these years.  If you &#8220;hug&#8221; them even more in lieu of &#8220;a## kissing,&#8221; you are only begging for more mahogany mobs.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the mainstream media covered it up. Blacks were greatly overrepresented in the London riots. This is an analysis of the riots.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The research says you&rsquo;ve got to be careful about corporal punishment, because it can teach kids that violence is a solution, and it&rsquo;s not.&#8221;</p>
<p>What &#8220;research&#8221; are they talking about?  Dr. Spock  &mdash;  who made up most of his &#8220;findings&#8221; to suit his own theories?</p>
<p>When I was a kid, pretty much every kid I knew had been spanked or had the belt taken to them  &mdash;  and none of them grew up to be violent or criminal.  In fact, it was just the opposite: kids that feared physical punishment from their parents generally were a lot more cautious about getting into any kind of trouble.</p>
<p>But then again, I&rsquo;m talking about White kids here.  Blacks probably are more likely to resort to violence  &mdash;  not  because their parent spanked them  &mdash;  but rather because people with low IQs are easily frustrated and resort to physical force to solve their problems.</p>

Here&rsquo;s yet another theory:</p>
<p><i>Welcome to the year 2011 where ethics, sociology, economics, criminology, politics and technology cross!  The flash mobbers are trying to tell us, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop us, but with your help, we can stop ourselves!&rdquo;</i></p>

		<p>The vast majority of rioters in London and other cities were nonwhite. In fact it was nonwhites who started the riots, and eventually some whites probably got caught up in it and then participated.</p>

<p>I also think it depends on how the parents use corporal punishment.  You and all your friends knew that you did something wrong, and your parents found out all the facts.  But once the facts were established, and they were convinced beyond a reasonable doubt you misbehaved badly enough to warrant that kind of punishment, you got spanked.  You came to understand some semblance of &#8220;due process of the household law,&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<p>The problem with the way most black parents use corporal punishment is that A) They don&rsquo;t use some semblance of due process, and B) They spank not because the kid really did something wrong, but because the kid is inconveniencing the parent.  In that case, Mr. Williams III is correct, that that kind of wanton violence only breeds and begets more wanton violence.</p>

		<p>I was flipping through a copy of Newsweek while waiting in line at the self-checkout line at the supermarket. All the London rioters were white according to the pictures Newsweek published.</p>
<p>By the way, it took forever in the self checkout line because the black girl who was two people ahead of me could not figure out how to ring up 3 cans!  The woman behind me was furious!</p>

<p>But of course, THEY don&rsquo;t have to &#8216;be careful&rsquo; about dishing out &#8216;random beatdowns.&rsquo; That would be r-a-c-i&hellip; Eh, I can&rsquo;t be bothered to even spell the word anymore.</p>
<p>Ok - anyway. I think it&rsquo;s time for an AmRen group hug. All posters gather around. C&rsquo;mon now - it&rsquo;ll cure all your problems. Trust me - I&rsquo;m an affirmative action &#8216;educational psychologist.&rsquo; I KNOW what I&rsquo;m talking about here.</p>

		<p>Every notice that as women get more power in the West, we have a progressively stupider and stupider approach to dealing with virtually all social problems?   That&rsquo;s what happens when estrogen poisoned drama queens start making all the rules.   Because their goal isn&rsquo;t law and order and the smooth operation of commerce, like those stupid old men used to do.  The goal of the new age power female is to maximize melodrama and disharmony simply as a matter of personal entertainment and the ignorant pursuit of some deranged masochistic fantasy drawn from their own issues of intense self loathing. </p>

		<p><i>Charles: They really need a hug more than an ass-whipping. That&rsquo;s going to be my new campaign, &#8216;Hugs, not ass-whippings.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Conservative&#8221; leader David Cameron gave the same lame reasons to excuse violent black rioters in London in the <i>Hug a Hoodie</i>  speech he presented to the Centre for Social Justice: </p>
<p><i>Imagine a housing estate with a little park next to it.</i></p>
<p><i>The estate has &#8216;no ballgames&rsquo; and &#8216;no skateboarding&rsquo; notices all over it.</i></p>
<p><i>The park is just an empty space.</i></p>
<p><i>And then imagine you are 14 years old, and you live in a flat four storeys up.</i></p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s the summer holidays and you don&rsquo;t have any pocket money.</i></p>
<p><i>That&rsquo;s your life&hellip;</i></p>
<p><i>Who isn&rsquo;t bored?</i></p>
<p><i>Who isn&rsquo;t hanging around because they don&rsquo;t have any money?</i></p>
<p><i>Who has the cars, the clothes, the power?</i></p>
<p><i>But there are connections between circumstances and behaviour.</i></p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s easy to feel pessimistic&hellip;</i></p>
<p><i>But I think that&rsquo;s the wrong response.</i></p>
<p><i>We&rsquo;ve got to believe we can do something about the terrible problems of youth crime and disorder.</i></p>
<p><i>We&rsquo;ve got be optimistic about young people, otherwise we&rsquo;ll forever be dealing with the short-term symptoms instead of the long-term causes.</i></p>
<p>So, to relieve boredom, Mr. Cameron/Blair/Brown, it&rsquo;s OK to riot?  OK to relieve boredom through violence?  Is that what you&rsquo;re telling us? </p>
<p>You and Charles A. Williams III, are giving &#8220;young people&#8221; reason to riot!  Hey, I&rsquo;m bored   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s go break some shop windows, lift some &#8220;kicks&#8221;, crack a few white heads while we&rsquo;re at it!  Mr. Cameron and Charles A. Williams III will make excuses for us so let&rsquo;s go!  What have we to lose?  There will be no consequences, the punishment HUGS.</p>
<p>These &#8220;young people&#8221; deserve nothing but deadly force to stop their thuggish, criminal behavior.</p>
<p>The long term cause, Mr.Cameron/Blair/Brown is blacks.  England has imported far too many of them because of foolish elites such as yourself.  </p>
<p>The ONLY answer is to put an immediate end to Third World immigration and expel all nonwhite from England.</p>
<p>NOTHING ELSE WILL WORK.</p>

		<p>For some black youth, this and other kinds of hooliganism are considered a rite of passage. Unfortunately, this kind of stuff is a dangerous rite of passage. It can lead to incarceration, a felony record, even death or permanent disability depending on how things turn out. If the black community shares the view that most participating in this kind of activity are just youth who need sense of direction, they&rsquo;d better pull themselves together and start providing some, uh, direction. But don&rsquo;t count on it.</p>
<p>The leaders are out there talking about vast and overarching visions of justice and redemption. Vision has its place, but how can the mundane world of work and and a weekly paycheck, which is what deprived people most need to become part of, stack up against all of these verbal pyrotechnics? If the black underclass would more clearly understand that desired end result of the impetus toward &#8220;justice&#8221; is a paycheck, we would all be better off.</p>

		<p>More silly mouthings from a liberal &#8220;expert&#8221;.  Hugs indeed.<br>
They do it because they enjoy beating on whites Knowing the odds are that they will suffer no consequences.  Smashing, looting, burning, assault.  Normal, law abiding citizens are viewed as suckers.  Video games are boring compared to the real thing.  <br>
Criminals are lazy, vicious and willing to stomp you if you get in their way.  Read Stanton Samenow&rsquo;s books re criminals.<br>

		<p>I live in center city Philadelphia, where I&rsquo;ve personally seen enough of the black mobs to know that no amount of hugs, kisses and nice words will help.</p>
<p>My tax dollars go to pay police to stand at the corner of 15th and Chestnut, to make sure that mobs don&rsquo;t form outside of the Wendy&rsquo;s, as they have been doing early this summer and all of the last couple of summers, menacingly taunting Whites as they try to squeeze by on 15th and on Chestnut. Wendy&rsquo;s has such long lines that they must have enough money to pay for armed, uniformed, private security, but instead, they let the problem get so out of hand that police have become a requirement. You don&rsquo;t see this on the news.</p>
<p>This past July 4th, late in the evening, after the fireworks, I saw throngs of blacks, literally thousands of them, gathering at City Hall and for blocks around. A few blacks would stop in a particular spot, then a minute later, there would be dozens standing in that same spot. A group of about a dozen police, on motorcycles, had to drive down Chestnut street, from 15th to Broad, ON BOTH SIDEWALKS, to get the crowd to move, and even then, the blacks were rather slow and reluctant, as if they were trying to squeeze out just a tiny bit more domination of the street, before having to capitulate. Again, you don&rsquo;t see this on the news.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m the one who needs a hug.</p>

<p>Since riots and uprisings are now en vogue the world over and with signs that they will soon reach the shores of America, would it be that much of a stretch to suggest President Obama&rsquo;s election campaign would be willing to incite race riots in the hopes of guilting white Americans into casting a vote for a President who is progressively losing popularity and support at an ever accelerating rate?</p>
<p>He really does have a civilian army and they have been armed with free cellphones and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to find out that &#8220;fast and furious&#8221; guns wound up in his personal army.</p>
<p>The current flash mobs are very organized and for now just good practice.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s no question that lack of love and attention (and discipline) in childhood has contributed to their present criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s a little late to love and comfort them.  What they need now is a dose of the Marine brig at Portsmouth, NH as it was in the Fifties.  They&rsquo;d emerge respectful and docile.</p>

		<p>As a kid, I was restrained from mis-behavior by a combination of religious beliefs and respect for my parents. I would never want to bring shame upon them! Both motives are shunned now. This explains a lot to me.<br>

<p>Every notice that as women get more power in the West, we have a progressively stupider and stupider approach to dealing with virtually all social problems? That&rsquo;s what happens when estrogen poisoned drama queens start making all the rules.</p>
<p>Average Dude I love you.  I have been saying this all my life.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t think women should even be allowed to vote, let alone be Judges and politicians considering what White women have done to the White race.</p>
<p>Vdare published that when an illegal immigrant with felony convictions has a woman immigration hearing officer he or she has a 40 percent better chance of being allowed to stay in this country than if the hearing officer is a man.</p>
<p>NOW was and is a communist front group. Women fell for its nonsense like the fools they are.</p>
<p>Feminazi man hating is artificial. Their real motive is ultimate power.  As Hitler used Jews as scapegoats, as Lenin used Ukranians as scapegoats the feminazis use White men. Every cause needs an enemy to unite its followers.  If Moscow had told NOW to scapegoat black women they would have.</p>
<p>What I depsise most about feminazis is that these so called anti rape crusaders have allied themselves with blacks and hispanics the most rape and child molestation prone men in the country.  NOW wants to import more and more hispanic rapists and africans to rape more American women.</p>
<p>I truly think the extreme muslims are right.<br>

		<p>The hugs would be a great idea along with some free blankets; I would gladly hand them out in great number.The time is coming for the white race to stand up or continue hiding in the closet of the house we have built. We as a race have given it away because no one on this Earth could have taken it.</p>

		<p>Actually Cameron in the UK started this - he called it &#8220;Hug a hoodie&#8221; program.  It abruptly ended after he was mocked, on camera, by the &#8220;hoodies&#8221; he was trying to hug.  Pretty funny.</p>
<p>Apparently technology hasn&rsquo;t reached the point where people in this country can learn from the mistakes of people in other countries.</p>
<p>So now the USA is going to try the exact same thing with the exact same problem which failed in the UK - I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll work now though.</p>

<p>Check out who started the feminist movement and their types still do. The movers and shakers. Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, Gloria Steinem. These were socialist/marxist radicals in America and their types were also involved in every radical movement in our country. Read of all the &#8220;radical socialist movements&#8221; they were involved in. Civil Rights movement, gay rights, equal rights, everything that was bad for White America. They promoted black and white &#8220;integration&#8221; (miscegenation) also and with these types we can lay the blame for the downfall of White women, divorce, single mothers, abortion, promiscuity, demonization of White men and everything that goes with it. The 1965 Immigration Act would also be on their approval list&hellip;In other words, these &#8220;women&#8221; and their ilk in my view, are the ones responsible for the complete downfall of White women/men in America today and our enslavement to the powers that be. </p>

<p>I must commend you both, especially margaret, for pounding on the feminist movement, pointing out the evil it is and the harm it has done to Western Civilization.  It has femini-nazi-ized the schools and most workplaces and driven a wedge between White men and women.  Any movement that portrays ALL White males as being a part of a &#8220;rape culture&#8221; or debases motherhood and children deserves all the scorn and derision that possibly can be heaped upon it.</p>
<p>I would also include Helen Gurley Brown on the list of those progressive &#8220;feminists&#8221; who have debased our culture by sneering at and mocking such traditional institutions as marriage and family:</p>
<p><i>In 1965 Cosmopolitan came under the editorship of Helen Gurley Brown, author of the bestselling book Sex and the Single Girl, a kind of how-to manual for young, single women to lead sexually satisfying lives. Brown, who would remain Cosmopolitan editor in chief for more than thirty years, turned the magazine into a low-brow, sex-focused glossy geared toward young women.</i> </p>
<p><i>She encouraged these women to enjoy lots of sex with multiple partners (including married men), avoid marrying young or having children, and to amuse themselves by sexually teasing men.&rsquo; Cosmo proffered a rather demeaning view of men, and men were encouraged to have a similarly degrading attitude toward women.</i> </p>
<p>  &mdash;  The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Sixties (p. 31). </p>
<p>Keep up the good work!!  These subversives and anti-White radicals deserve to be &#8220;outed&#8221; as much as possible and their evil deeds brought into the light for everyone to see the harm they&rsquo;ve done to the traditions of White Civilization.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
