<p>Rebecca English, Daily Mail (London), August 18, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Prince Charles claimed yesterday that many of those involved in last week&rsquo;s riots had joined gangs as &#8216;a cry for help&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He made clear his belief that many of Britain&rsquo;s social ills could be put down to a lack of &#8216;self-confidence and self-esteem&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Asked for his thoughts on what lay behind some of the troublemakers&rsquo; actions, he said: &#8216;Half the problem is that people join gangs because it&rsquo;s a cry for help and they&rsquo;re looking for a sense of belonging.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He and the Duchess of Cornwall toured several of the worst-hit areas in the capital yesterday, meeting householders and businessmen devastated by days of violence and looting.</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s views were contrasted with those of many he met, who blamed the troubles firmly on an increasing lack of discipline and respect among young people.</p>
<p>Charles said he believed schools shouldered part of the blame. &#8216;There are not enough extra-curricular activities-organised games or other kinds of activities to tire them out. You have got so much energy and aggression at that age.</p>
<p>&#8216;Young people need self-confidence, we have to motivate and encourage them and give them responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8216;We should have national community service to give all sorts of opportunities. All we have been doing is dealing with the symptoms, not giving the opportunities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Police have said that 25 per cent of those held after the disturbances are linked to gangs.</p>
<p>Charles&rsquo;s contribution to the increasingly heated national debate on the causes of the riots came during a discussion in Hackney, east London, with young businessmen and women who have been helped by his charity, the Prince&rsquo;s Trust.</p>
<p>Although many of those present expressed their gratitude to the prince for coming, their views were notably less sympathetic towards those responsible.</p>
<p>One man said: &#8216;Young people are getting far too much . . . they expect everything to be given to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Natasha Faith, 25, who has a jewellery business in Forest Gate and also met the prince, said: &#8216;Respect has to be learned. Young people were obviously lacking that in the riots.</p>
<p>&#8216;They had power but no respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Laura Rennis, 26, who is setting up a holistic therapy centre in Edmonton with help from the Prince&rsquo;s Trust, told Charles: &#8216;Everybody wants to be famous rather than successful.</p>
<p>&#8216;They ought to be offered positive models, young people doing (good) things rather than (news about) Cheryl Cole&rsquo;s new house.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am sure David Beckham is lovely but you have to get young people thinking there is more to life than just kicking a ball.</p>
<p>&#8216;The same angst and fire people had in their belly when they were rioting needs to be directed . . . direct that fire please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charles and Camilla interrupted their annual holiday in Scotland to fly to London for the day. They began their tour in Tottenham, where the violence began.</p>
<p>The duchess said she had watched the &#8216;senseless&rsquo; events unfold with a mixture of horror and disbelief.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is absolutely terrible. We were watching it on television and I had to pinch myself. I just couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes. It was so senseless. I could not believe it was happening in this country.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She patted one Afro-Caribbean woman on the arm and said: &#8216;The next few months will be hard but stick together. Show that spirit of true Britishness that is so important.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied warmly: &#8216;Oh we will, we will. We are British through and through. The way people have pulled together to help us has been inspiring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charles was particularly taken by the stories of several families who feared that they would not be covered for the damage and loss by their household insurance policies.</p>
<p>He asked his private secretary to make a note of their details. An aide said: &#8216;He was struck by this very same problem after the floodings a couple of years ago and wants to see what he can do to chivvy them up. He strongly believes businesses should pull together at times like these.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As well as making a personal donation of a dozen food processors to families who have lost their homes and belongings in Tottenham, the Prince&rsquo;s Trust is making an extra Â£2.5million available to help disaffected young people get on their feet.</p>
<p>Later in the day the couple travelled on to Croydon where they saw some of the fire-ravaged homes and businesses in London Road.</p>
<p>Sherrilyn Miller, a retail manager, said: &#8216;I have lost everything I own in the world, including the only photograph I had of my dead father.</p>
<p>&#8216;My neighbour even lost his wife&rsquo;s ashes and has been asking the rescue workers to see if they can find them.&rsquo;</p>
