<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/19/obama-whites-need-not-apply/">EDITORIAL: Obama: Whites Need Not Apply</a></h1>
 

<p>Washington Times, August 19, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>The White House issued an executive order on Thursday titled &#8220;Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce.&#8221; The purpose of the order is &#8220;to promote the federal workplace as a model of equal opportunity, diversity and inclusion.&#8221; In other words, it would be better for the government if public-spirited white workers sought employment elsewhere. Lost amid all the politically correct box-checking is the principle that the most qualified person should be hired for a job.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The order states that by law, the federal government&rsquo;s recruitment policies should &#8220;endeavor to achieve a workforce from all segments of society&#8221; and that &#8220;as the nation&rsquo;s largest employer, the federal government has a special obligation to lead by example.&#8221; In that respect, the government could largely declare mission accomplished. A quick look at the demographic breakdown of the federal payroll shows that &#8220;diversity&#8221; goals have been more than met. According to the Office of Personnel Management, federal employees in fiscal 2010 were 66.2 percent white, 17.7 percent black, 8 percent Hispanic, 5.6 percent Asian and Pacific Islander and 1.8 percent American Indian. Compared to the general U.S. population, the federal force is a bit too diverse. Blacks are overrepresented by 6.9 percent compared to the civilian work force, Asians and Pacific Islanders by 1.2 percent, and American Indians are more than double their proportion of the population at large. White Americans, who make up about 70 percent of the work force, are underrepresented by around 4 percent. Hispanics are also underrepresented despite the Clinton-era executive order 13171, &#8220;Hispanic Employment in the Federal Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Mr. Obama has squandered his chance to lead America away from the divisive racial politics of the past. This executive order tells America that in the Obama administration, race-based preferences are still business as usual.</p>
