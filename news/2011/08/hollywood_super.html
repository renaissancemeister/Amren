<p>The big budget disappointment Green Lantern was about a superhero whose powers were only limited by his imagination. But I kind of get the feeling that Hollywood&rsquo;s earning powers are being limited by its lack of imagination.</p>
<p>Consider the box office potential if movie producers had been as bold as Marvel&rsquo;s Ultimate Comics Spider-Man series when it introduced Miles Morales-a part black, part Hispanic teen-as the new Spider-man.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So if Hollywood can crank out fantasy pictures with blue Smurfs, why is it so reticent to do the same with African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians? If second stringers like Thor can get the big-screen treatment, don&rsquo;t comic book legends of color like Luke Cage and Black Panther deserve the same?</p>
<p>{snip} There&rsquo;s a self-fulfilling delusion at work in the studio system that white audiences won&rsquo;t pay to see black actors cast outside a narrow type of role.</p>
<p>There is, however, a bit of evidence to back that claim. In the concisely titled study &#8220;The Role of Actors&rsquo; Race in White Audiences&rsquo; Selective Exposure to Movies,&#8221; Indiana University professor Andrew Weaver writes, &#8220;Movie producers are often reluctant to cast more than a few minority actors in otherwise race-neutral movies for fear that the white audience will largely avoid such films.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weaver found that white audiences tended to be racially selective with regard to romantic movies, but not necessarily when it came to other genres. So, sorry, Hollywood. You can&rsquo;t blame it on the ticket buyers. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for a real leap, how about casting Will Smith as Superman; Denzel Washington as Superman&rsquo;s father, Jor-El; and Michelle Rodriguez as Lois Lane? I guarantee you non-stop chatter until the film opens.</p>
