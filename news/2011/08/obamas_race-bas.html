<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=337941">Obama&rsquo;s Race-Based Spoils System</a></h1>
 

<p>Patrick J. Buchanan, World Net Daily, August 25, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In our time, however, Chester Arthur&rsquo;s achievement [making the U.S. government into a meritocracy] has been undone, as a racial spoils system in federal hiring and promotions has been imposed by Democratic presidents, unresisted by Republicans who rarely exhibit the courage to stand up for their principles when the subject is race.</p>
<p>A week ago, an item buried in the Washington Post reported that Obama had &#8220;issued an executive order requiring government agencies to develop plans for improving federal workforce diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama, wrote Isaac Arnsdorf, is targeting &#8220;a problem that has been on the administration&rsquo;s radar. Whites still hold more than 81 percent of senior pay-level positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as white folks are two-thirds of the U.S. population, and perhaps three-fourths of those in the 45 to 65 age group who would normally be at senior federal positions, why is this &#8220;a problem&#8221;?</p>
<p>As no one has contended otherwise, we have to assume that the men and women who hold these top positions got there because of the longevity of their service and the superiority of their skills.</p>
<p>Why is the color of their skin a &#8220;problem&#8221; for Barack Obama?</p>
<p>As reported here previously, African-Americans are hardly underrepresented in the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Though only 12 percent to 13 percent of the U.S. population, blacks hold 18 percent of all federal jobs. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The EEOC, where African-Americans are overrepresented by 300 percent, has been asked to oversee the new &#8220;government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making this up.</p>
<p>Perhaps, while he is battling for a greater diversity of sacrifice and rewards up there on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, our president might reflect on another example of the overrepresentation of white males-in the caskets coming home to Dover.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Does this overrepresentation of white men in the body bags and caskets coming home bother our commander in chief, who wants fewer white men at the top level of his executive branch?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Has Obama taken a close look at his hypocritical party on Capitol Hill? Though African-Americans are fully 25 percent of all Democratic voters, in a Senate Democratic Caucus of 53 members, there is not a single black man or black woman.</p>
<p>Well, regretfully, we are told, none was elected.</p>
<p>But if liberals believe in affirmative action, why don&rsquo;t Democratic senators practice as well as preach it? Why don&rsquo;t they lead by example rather than by exhortation?</p>
<p>Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer have been around for decades. Why do they not agree to flip a coin, have one resign, and have Gov. Jerry Brown appoint Rep. Barbara Lee, head of the Black Caucus, to the U.S. Senate?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Senate liberals applaud affirmative action programs that deny white students and white federal workers admissions and promotions they have earned by their labors. But when, ever, has one of these liberals voluntarily made the sacrifice that he demands be imposed upon others?</p>
