<p>Bob Donovan is an alderman in Wisconsin who presides over a district that includes Milwaukee, WI. Earlier this month, a riot erupted at a nearby state fair in which blacks were pitted against whites as hundreds and as many as a thousand youths viciously attacked one another. Donovan told RT that Milwaukee may be a diverse community, it is also one that is grossly segregated.</p>
<p>Donovan says that while whites and blacks may keep to their own sides of the city, minorities in Milwaukee are facing a plague that is ravaging their community. Black male unemployment, said Donovan, is an epidemic. &#8220;Some are placing it as close to 50 percent,&#8221; he told RT. &#8220;That has its problems that unfortunately there are far too many individuals in Milwaukee can chose to ignore it.&#8221; And with that unemployment comes unrest aimed towards those who are getting by with jobs and money in cities just like his.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Inequality among races, now leading to violence, is something Donovan says can&rsquo;t just be ignored. The community is in denial, he said, and cites that many lawmakers won&rsquo;t admit that the incident at the state fair was racial.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s absurd!&#8221; said Donovan.</p>
<p>Donovan says that it is the number one objective of the government to insure that its citizens are kept safe, and with incidents like this continuing (even if they aren&rsquo;t reported), he says cities should start thinking outside the box for ways to combat unemployment and inequality before riots and revolts become more commonplace. {snip}<br>

		<p>So as I have asked before on this site, if I don&rsquo;t hire a black for my business and have him represent my business in his duties then I should understand the logic behind his then burning down my business and taking my life. Now it&rsquo;s all clear. </p>

		<p>notice how a white group is immediately labeled, &#8220;neo nazi&#8221; and how reprehensible their ideas are.  The white group is merely standing up for itself.  Why aren&rsquo;t the black groups labeled what they truly are, racist, hate-filled and prejudicial.  Our (white) politicians only call for more police presence.  Whites aren&rsquo;t allowed to defend themselves?  Our politicians are fearful and very incorrect in their mishmash white flag approach.  <br>
The black community has no answers or desire to address their many problems&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  <br>
The white community is fed up with that.</p>

It&rsquo;s ABSURD for him to mention race.  Everyone knows that &#8220;we must do more to understand the historic injustices that have caused so much pain and suffering in the black community and are perpetuated by unchecked and unearned White privilege through systemic bias and institutionalized racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mentioning race is only code word for Whiteys to all start bitterly clinging to their guns and religion and vote GOP in 2012. The NAACP-CBC should get him fired. </p>
<p>If the violent flash mob beatings had anything to do with race, then the SPLC would have told us so in their last fundraising letter.  They stressed Tolerance, not flash mobs, so now we know it&rsquo;s a problem of Intolerance that need to be fought, not flash mobs. To suggest otherwise is ABSURD.</p>

<p>Dear Friend, </p>
<p>School doors are opening across the country, and we&rsquo;re getting a rush of orders for our renowned Teaching Tolerance materials. Won&rsquo;t you please help us be ready to distribute these classroom materials  &mdash;  free of charge  &mdash;  to every school that requests them? </p>
<p>With hate groups at record levels and extremism growing, it&rsquo;s critical that we nurture acceptance in our schools. Too many impressionable children are being exposed to hateful rhetoric in the media and, sadly, in their own schools. Here are just a few recent examples: </p>
<p>•	A Utah student wore a [K] hood and shouted &#8220;white power.&#8221;</p>
<p>•	A black California student was chained to his locker while teammates allegedly yelled &#8220;slave for sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>•	A North Carolina teacher told an American child of Latino heritage to &#8220;go back to your own country!&#8221;</p>
<p>Our Teaching Tolerance program is making a real difference. For example, more than 50,000 copies of our free film kit about anti-LGBT bullying, Bullied, have already been sent to schools. Our Teaching Tolerance magazine goes to more than 400,000 teachers twice each year. The next issue mails in just a couple of weeks at a cost of more than $350,000. </p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;m asking if you will send whatever you can afford to help meet the demand for our free tolerance education materials and our other work for justice. Your gift now will help us accomplish even more in the year ahead.</p>
<p>  <br>
Sincerely,<br>
 <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m tired of people always blaming whites for this!  It&rsquo;s not our fault they&rsquo;re poor or irresponsible or losers, to be blunt.  Whites have bent over backwards for decades now and they are worse off and more entitled today than they were before the 60s.  Hell, even a black president has made them worse.  This is why whites and other stay away from blacks.  It&rsquo;s not their skin color.  It&rsquo;s their attitude and culture people detest.  Of course, blacks and liberals won&rsquo;t admit that.  No.  They&rsquo;ll blame it on whites and slavery, etc.</p>

<p>Clip and paste from soviet era propaganda.  Groups of several blacks attacked lone Whites.  Milwaukee was one of the most crime free cities in the country until about 1965 when blacks who had destroyed their neighborhoods in Chicago moved up there to get away from other blacks.</p>
<p>They brought all their pathologies with them.<br>

		<p>The problem is racism, not unemployment.  In November 2008 I went to vote in Milwaukee at a local school.  There was a long wait, so I had time to notice the bulletin boards.  On one, a notice about &#8220;Stolen Legacy,&#8221; how all civilization originated in Africa and was stolen by those evil whites.  On another, many photos of rap singers.  And it seems their lyrics are hardly pro-white.  When schools teach racism: and I mean anti-white racism, is it surprising when Blacks attack whites, as they did around July 4 in Milwaukee, and then again a month later at the opening of State Fair?  According to university sociologists, psychologist, etc., Black racism does not exist.  The academics are excusiologists.  Alderman Donovan is often sensible, but to blame the Milwaukee racist attacks on unemployment is nonsense.The attacks are an expression of wide-spread Black racism.</p>

<p>If Morris Dees is really interested in &#8220;teaching tolerance,&#8221; instead of making money, he can give the Alabama chapter of the National Education Association his materials for free, and they can distribute it to all the schools in Dees&rsquo;s own state.  It wouldn&rsquo;t be a long physical journey   &mdash;   The SPLC and the ANEA buildings are all within the same square block.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many latinos have come to Wisconsin and scooped up all the jobs that might have been given to blacks?  I live in a place with tons of young black males and females, but I almost never ever see a black person with a job.  It&rsquo;s all latinos, everywhere, from little restaurants to construction to the chain stores.</p>

<p>Unemployment and equality have about as much to do with the black on white beatings as the Pope does.</p>
<p>This is plain black misbehavior and it is caused by the likes of black anti-white hate preached throughout the black communities all across the country.</p>
<p>The congregation at Jeremiah Wright&rsquo;s church is the norm, not the exception.</p>
<p>Jobs and so-called &#8220;equality&#8221; won&rsquo;t help one iota, because this isn&rsquo;t about either one.  The brilliant suggestion of midnight basketball won&rsquo;t help either.</p>

<p>Oh, Alderman! <br>
Boarding schools aren&rsquo;t the answer. Nightsticks, bullets and more very harsh prison cells with life sentences, and liberal use of the death penalty, are!<br>
But we all know that. You don&rsquo;t coddle super violent criminals. You do away with them, or they do away with you.<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s not what happened at all.  A mob of hundreds of blacks attacked lone whites.  It&rsquo;s like the typical American newspaper article will describe a 10 on 1 black on white beating as a &#8220;fight.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>If Obama could somehow give every American black a million in reparations, a fancy car, mansion, and white slaves, many would go on the biggest rampage in history!  New millionaires would loot beer from quickie marts, and little old white ladies would be shoved off the sidewalk, bludgeoned, and/or gang raped.  Blacks are seldom, if ever, out of control because of economic grievances.  Any perceived new freedom or privelege sends the worst of them into an orgiastic frenzy of violence.  When white society kept a tight psychological rein over the ghetto, almost all its denizens were afraid to leave it and molest whites.</p>

		<p>Why is it black unemployment among blacks? How many have a work history without a criminal record and at least a high school degree.<br>
It is not unemployment it is Blacks hating Whites. And it is Whites being soft targets.<br>
 The black that tried to rob me is still running. Unfortunately I missed. Memphis police ruled it a justified shooting. A lot of it was caught on camera. </p>

		<p>Notice how this Donovan addresses the problem. He says, &#8221; ..thousand youths viciously attacked one another..&#8221;. This is worse than a lie; the fact is that blacks randomly attacked the whites. Donovon&rsquo;s making excuses for them makes him unfit for any political office. In fact it&rsquo;s worse; Donovan wants to reward them for it by increasing the governmental benefits the black youths receive.</p>

<p>This makes it sound as if the numbers of white and black involvement was somewhat equal and balanced.  We know that this is a lie.</p>
<p>And it IS funny to see these people blaming this particular event on segregation, and all the usual suspects.  The FACT is that blacks don&rsquo;t even try to improve and rely on whites like these to apologize and encourage more whites to do things like date blacks in an effort to &#8220;make it better.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Donovan&rsquo;s solution is to expand the socialist state to the point of opening orphanages and take kids from blacks parents, who &#8220;can&rsquo;t handle&#8221; the burden of raising their kids, along with those government jobs they have already been given by the state.</p>
<p>As others point out, this has nothing to do with the Marxist view of class and race discrimination, it is due to the anti-white racism being taught in black youth culture, and the assiduous permission they feel through the fact of a black in the White House.  It appears to me that black parents are doing little to counter their children&rsquo;s apparent thinking habits and attitudes.</p>

Yea great. The only countries that do that are Third World hellholes. I detect Rush Limbaugh behind this. No the only way to cure this is to have a First World Country and a high minimum wage and a strong safety net. The only way to achieve first World status is by having First World People. In other words Whites. If you would like to see the results when your method is tried just go to Panama City, or Guatemala City or Caracas . The people just get more violent and GO to your neighborhoods to rob you.</p>

<p>Agree on most everything you say, disagree on the minimum wage.  It&rsquo;s largely a red herring issue.  From an economic standpoint, a minimum wage, like all price floors, is either ineffective (when it&rsquo;s under the supply-demand wage equilibrium) or destructive, creating unemployment (when it is above the equilibrium, creating an excess of supply, i.e. unemployment.)</p>
<p>The better solution is to change the game, change the economic curves in favor of labor, especially white labor.  That means vastly reduced if any non-white immigration, little white immigration, and a resurgence of the labor union movement.  Add in some trade protectionism to create extra demand for American labor, and with increased demand and decreased supply, the equilibrium wage goes way way way up.</p>
<p>However, you just can&rsquo;t hack around the existing pathetic demand-supply curves for labor with a red herring price floor and expect things to get better.</p>

<p>How can labor have any pricing power when you can pay workers $3/hr to manufacture something.  Of course if that&rsquo;s too rich for your tastes there are always countries such as Vietnam that can manufacture things for even less.  </p>
<p>Another issue is this since multinationals have moved their manufacturing bases overseas it&rsquo;s more inconvenient to have their purchasing and product development departments in the US,which explains IBM&rsquo;s decision to move its purchasing operations to Shenzhen China.  </p>
<p>Of course as Chinese companies have improved their quality and expertise they and not their Western customers will have the technical know to manufacture technical goods.  Remember the Pentagon can&rsquo;t even go war without Chinese made products:</p>

<p>The situation is bad if not hopeless.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Donovan says &hellip; cities should start thinking &hellip; for ways to combat unemployment &hellip;&rdquo; Could start by abolishing minimum wage and welfare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yea great. The only countries that do that are Third World hellholes. I detect Rush Limbaugh behind this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well said; Fox had a discussion about that this morning.  Fox of course was all for it. </p>
<p>Suppose they do get the minimum down to $3.00 per hour.  Where would the workers live?  They would not even be able to live in their car because they would not even have a car.</p>
<p>The only workers able to afford any kind of rent would be those hispanic indians who live 13 guys to a studio.</p>
<p>It would be either like China (and American Chinatown businesses)<br>
where the employees sleep on the premises or like India where the employees are homeless and sleep on the street.</p>
<p>If the 100 million invaders that arrived in the last 40 years were sent home wages would rise.  Most jobs would be living wage jobs.</p>
<p>Supply and demand.  Karl Marx talked about the reserve army of the unemployed that would keep wages down forever.  His successors here in America added immigrants to the reserve army at the mercy of the cannibal capitalists that rule America.</p>
<p>Fox, Limbaugh, all those anti minimum wage idiots never consider welfare when advocating starvation level minimum wage.  When wages fall below welfare people go on welfare.  </p>
<p>Fox, Limbaugh also never consider what I call the work tax when advocating lowering wages. Work tax is the expense of going to work.  </p>
<p>How is a person making low wages supposed to get to work?  If the conservatives get minimum down to take home of $400.00 per month the workers obviously can&rsquo;t have a car.  So take the bus.<br>
That is what, $45 to $70 per month in most cities? Doesn&rsquo;t leave much for anything but food and salvation army clothes once in a while.  No rent.</p>
<p>White nationalism stands alone.  All other issues are irrelevant to our survival.  Don&rsquo;t get side tracked into other issues.</p>
<p>One good thing Fox did this am. It ran several clips of the black football players and coaches swarming the White man.</p>
<p>Fox is basically an unregistered lobbyist for a foreign country.</p>
<p>While I am at it, has Anne Coulter ever said anything at all in her 25 year career about affirmative action and black on White crime?</p>
<p>Like many, I thought the conservative movement might help Whites.<br>
I soon saw it for what it was, no more helpful to Whites than Maxine Waters and Al sharpton.<br>

<p>Barely, but not enough.  In her previous book, she explicitly defended the Council of Conservative Citizens, much to my delight.  But in her most recent book, she gushed all over Thurgood Marshall, insinuating that we should celebrate his b-day over the Rousseauean street hustler MLK.  That&rsquo;s bass ackwards IMHO   &mdash;   Let the blacks celebrate street hustlers and rabble rousers rather than mulattoes who dress up in our clothes and infiltrate our institutions to use our founding documents against us (Marshall)   &mdash;   Better the obvious enemy you can see rather than the hidden one you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Ann Coulter is nothing more than a lamestream conservative who occasionally dabbles her toes in our territory.</p>
