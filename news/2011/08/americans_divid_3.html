<p>Jeffrey M. Jones, Gallup, August 26, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Americans are about equally divided on whether Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s dream of U.S. racial equality has been realized, with 51% saying it has and 49% saying it has not. Blacks (54%) are slightly more optimistic than whites (49%) that the dream has been realized.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The poll included an oversample of black respondents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The poll finds Americans have very positive views of King. Ninety-four percent rate him positively on a scale ranging from +5 (very favorable) to -5 (very unfavorable), including 69% giving him a +4 or +5 rating.</p>
<p>Gallup asked the same question several times in the 1960s, and the current numbers represent a dramatic shift in the way Americans view King now compared with the past. His prior ratings were at best slightly more positive than negative, and in a 1966 measurement, Americans were nearly twice as likely to have a negative (63%) as positive (33%) opinion of him. That negative evaluation was likely the result of his public opposition to the Vietnam War at a time when Americans still favored it as well as the opposition of some to the continued push for expanded civil rights and economic legislation to assist blacks.</p>
<p>In the current poll, 65% of whites and 95% of blacks give King a +4 or +5 favorable rating.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given the high regard Americans currently have for Dr. King, it is not surprising that 91% approve of having a national memorial to him. {snip}</p>
