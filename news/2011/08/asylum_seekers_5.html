<h1><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3770936/Asylum-seekers-cost-British-taxpayers-23million-a-day.html">Asylum Seekers Cost £2m a Day</a></h1>
 

<p>Graeme Wilson, The Sun, August 24, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>Britain&rsquo;s chaotic asylum system has cost taxpayers £2.3million a day in the last decade.</p>
<p>Around 77 per cent who claimed asylum between 1997 and 2010 are still here.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands have been allowed to stay even though their claims have been rejected, a damning new report shows.</p>
<p>Costs including housing, cash support and legal fees added up to £10billion-or £2.3million a day, Migration Watch found. Decisions have been reached on a total of 660,000 asylum cases between 1997-2010. Of these, 26 per cent were granted asylum and 14 per cent got some other form of protection or leave to remain. It means 60 per cent of cases-around 417,000-should have been sent home. But only a third of them-around 119,000-went.</p>
<p>Homing in on one five-year period between 2004 and 2009, a similar picture emerged.</p>
<p>Sixty-two per cent of asylum applications were rejected, but just over a third of these were booted out. And officials are still clearing a backlog of 400,000 cases found in a warehouse in 2006.</p>
<p>Migration Watch chairman Sir Andrew Green said: &#8220;The asylum system has proved to be a £10billion shambles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Damian Green said: &#8220;The asylum system we inherited was hopelessly chaotic. Last year we reduced the total bill for asylum support by over £100million and it is falling further.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have nearly doubled the proportion of asylum seekers removed within one year of their application and 60 per cent of applicants now receive a decision in a month.&#8221;</p>
