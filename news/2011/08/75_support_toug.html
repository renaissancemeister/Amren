			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen, July 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey shows that three-out-of-four Likely U.S. Voters (75%) now favor strict government sanctions on those who hire illegal immigrants. Only 16% oppose such sanctions. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fifty-nine percent (59%) also support strict sanctions on landlords who rent or sell property to illegals. Twenty-four percent (24%) are opposed to tough laws against these landlords, but 17% more are undecided.</p>
<p>Data released this year showed that 65% of voters see employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants are a bigger problem than illegal immigrants who are seeking a job. Sixty-one percent (61%) favor shutting down companies that knowingly and repeatedly hire illegal immigrants .</p>
<p>Nearly two-out-of-three voters (65%) believe that if a police officer pulls someone over for a traffic violation, he or she should automatically check to see if that person is in the country legally. Twenty-six percent (26%) oppose those automatic checks.</p>

		<p>The old saying goes that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  While larger omnibus immigration legislation like Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070 always poll well, they don&rsquo;t poll universally well because of organized campaigns of hate on the part of the media, leftist activists, Raza rabble rousers, foreign diplomats and the Paranoia-Industrial Complex (poverty centers, defamation leagues, etc).  But when you ask people straight up about the individual parts, the parts mostly poll better than the whole.</p>

		<p> How can you be wishy washy on landlords renting to illegals? The undecided really annoy me at least I know who my enemies are. On this type of poll the undecided are simply cowards looking for who&rsquo;s going to win and will join right up when it&rsquo;s safe.</p>

		<p>While I&rsquo;m all for ridding employers of their incentives for hiring cheap immigrant slave-labor, I draw the line at the citizenship checks during traffic stops.</p>
<p>Similarly, the American people were assured that the TSA and DHS were being formed to &#8220;go after the terrorists&#8221; and that Constitution-shredding laws like the PATRIOT Act I &amp; II and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 were necessary to assure cooperation between law enforcement agencies at local, state, and national levels, in order to better facilitate apprehension of terrorists and to thwart terrorist acts.</p>
<p>Now, a few years down the road, we see that the true goal was to turn the screws on American citizens. Wheelchair-bound grandmothers and crippled children are daily victimized by the thugs in government-issued costumes, and the rest of us are subjected to the same sexual assaults (pat-downs) and irradiating by these thugs . All in the name of &#8220;National Security&#8221; and &#8220;keeping us safe&#8221;.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for. I can see a &#8220;quick citizenship check&#8221; soon becoming a de facto &#8220;Your papers, please,&#8221; in no time flat. Think of the REAL ID Act that&rsquo;s been on the back burner for the last few years.</p>
<p>And maybe it will start just in the border States; maybe it will at first only affect those of dubious or even obvious national origins. But how long do you really think it will take until the same laws get turned on us in the name of &#8220;fairness&#8221; or &#8220;non-discrimination&#8221;?</p>
<p>Clearly, the illegal immigration issue needs to be addressed. Doing something - anything - is better than the way things are now. But carrying around a national ID or risking jail or prison is not the kind of country I want to live in.</p>

		<p>&#8220;U.S. Voters (75%) now favor strict government sanctions on those who hire illegal immigrants.&#8221;</p>
<p>US Voters are under the mistaken belief that the USA is a democracy, where the Majority rule.  NO, No, No!   In the USA today, a small cynical, selfish, liberal elite rule and make the laws.  It does not matter what the majority of the people want.  Instead, the elites who control the government do what they want.</p>
<p>For 50 years now, the majority of USA citizens have wanted an end to illegal immigration, yet not only does our government refuse to implement the will of the people, our government actually 1) encourages illegal immigration, and 2) goes after anyone who tries to stem the illegal foreign invasion (i.e., Arizona &amp; Alabama).  The USA stopped being a democracy a long time ago.  </p>

		<p>I find myself agreeing with James posted.  Furthermore, who knows, maybe creating the illegal problem is a way to implement a &#8220;papers please&#8221; policy.  That&rsquo;s what it looks like to me.</p>
<p>Our elected &#8220;representatives&#8221; have made it perfectly clear they couldn&rsquo;t care less about We The People.</p>

<p>In a bid to remake the enforcement of federal immigration laws, the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants and auditing hundreds of businesses that blithely hire undocumented workers.</p>
<p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency expects to deport about 400,000 people this fiscal year, nearly 10 percent above the Bush administration&rsquo;s 2008 total and 25 percent more than were deported in 2007. The pace of company audits has roughly quadrupled since President George W. Bush&rsquo;s final year in office. <br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the semantic catch   &mdash;   &#8220;Deportation&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean literal deportation.  There are lots of barriers between starting the bureaucratic process of a deportation order (which is probably how the WaPo and the Obamaites define &#8220;deportation&#8221;), and actually sending someone from whence they came.</p>
