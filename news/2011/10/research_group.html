			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bob Yirka, PhysOrg, October 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>History is filled with examples of ethnic violence, the type that erupts when people with differing cultures attempt to live side by side. The Middle East comes to mind, as does Northern Ireland or Yugoslavia. What&rsquo;s not so common are studies done that show what sorts of things actually work to prevent problems when people of dissimilar backgrounds live next door to one another. Thus, a new study done by Yaneer Bar-Yam and his team at the New England Complex Systems Institute, appears to be particularly relevant. He and his colleagues, describe in their paper on the preprint server arXiv, how a study they&rsquo;ve done of the ethnically diverse country of Switzerland, shows that political and geographical boundaries have served to keep the peace between the different groups.</p>
<p>Switzerland, the very modern symbol of a peaceful country, might have gone another direction the team finds, were it not for the way the differing groups (French, German and Italian) and religions (Catholic and Protestant) have been physical grouped within the borders of the small country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>To find out how all these differing groups found a way to get along, the team looked at the geography of the country (mainly mountains and lakes) and how its regions are subdivided. In Switzerland, areas of the country are partitioned into what are known as cantons, which are similar to states in other countries except that each has much more autonomy than is usual. After careful study, the team found that the main reason the groups all manage to get along, is because they are separated from one another. Each canton is comprised of almost all the same types of people, essentially ruling themselves, thus, there is very little overlap. {snip} The end result is that people of differing cultures very seldom run into one another (except in the larger cites of course) and thus friction is averted. {snip}</p>
<p>One problem with the study of course is that it doesn&rsquo;t take into account the history of the land itself. {snip} But, nonetheless, the study does shed a rather bright light on the idea that simple separation can sometimes lead to peace. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong> </p>
<p>We consider the conditions of peace and violence among ethnic groups, testing a theory designed to predict the locations of violence and interventions that can promote peace. Characterizing the model&rsquo;s success in predicting peace requires examples where peace prevails despite diversity. Switzerland is recognized as a country of peace, stability and prosperity. This is surprising because of its linguistic and religious diversity that in other parts of the world lead to conflict and violence. Here we analyze how peaceful stability is maintained. Our analysis shows that peace does not depend on integrated coexistence, but rather on well defined topographical and political boundaries separating groups. Mountains and lakes are an important part of the boundaries between sharply defined linguistic areas. Political canton and circle (sub-canton) boundaries often separate religious groups. Where such boundaries do not appear to be sufficient, we find that specific aspects of the population distribution either guarantee sufficient separation or sufficient mixing to inhibit intergroup violence according to the quantitative theory of conflict. In exactly one region, a porous mountain range does not adequately separate linguistic groups and violent conflict has led to the recent creation of the canton of Jura. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that violence between groups can be inhibited by physical and political boundaries. A similar analysis of the area of the former Yugoslavia shows that during widespread ethnic violence existing political boundaries did not coincide with the boundaries of distinct groups, but peace prevailed in specific areas where they did coincide. The success of peace in Switzerland may serve as a model to resolve conflict in other ethnically diverse countries and regions of the world.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing how simple it it.  We use to know and understand that when we allowed to do just that.  But then comes along some screaming liberal with this idiotic melting pot theory and screwed up a nice semi peace full country.  Each had their own parts of town and for the most part neither ventured into the others area. The silly thing is, even though we have been forced to exist mixed together, we still cling to our original grouping.  They should have just left well enough alone.  </p>

		<p>Good fences make good neighbors.  I honestly see the possibility of a South Africanization of the United States in the near future.</p>
<p>As the reality denying current racial paradigm becomes increasingly rough to prop up, as year follows year, decade follows decade of same-o lamo-o results, I see increasing segregation as our only respectful, decent option.  </p>
<p>At the top, white/East Asian/various other &#8220;curve blowers&#8221; of various backgrounds, but ultimately some form of WHITE.  A brown &#8220;colored&#8221; middle race of Amerindian Latinos, Mulattoes, fallen white/East Asians in the middle, perhaps subdivided and self segregated from each other&hellip;</p>
<p>And a subclass which is largely of subsaharan African genetics, a black pool into which browns and sometimes whites are subsumed.  </p>
<p>In a true meritocracy curve breakers of even the lowest IQ geneto-ethnicities would advance and the capable would not suffer.  And certainly there are a few remarkable individuals who blow away the curve.</p>
<p>Perhaps not many depending on the specific geneto-ethnicity, but&hellip;</p>
<p>We ALL are still evolving.</p>
<p>Regardless, some form of Latin America, racially, may be our best bet.  Free association - free dissociation.  Some form of a strong meritocratic white plurality version of Apartheid South Africa may come to pass as well.</p>
<p>Or things could get real ugly, one way or another.  </p>

		<p> A very precise and accurate analysis, in my opinion. All this talk about a &#8220;glorious tapestry of diversity&#8221; we&rsquo;ve heard in America in the last 20-odd years is just so much slumgullion.</p>
<p> People of different races, religions and creeds get along best when they have their own neighborhoods, states or countries, with a &#8220;commons&#8221; area such as the largest cities where it&rsquo;s understood that it&rsquo;s more or less &#8220;neutral.&#8221; That was true in late 19th Century and early 20th Century New York City, with Irish, Jewish, Italian neighborhoods; it&rsquo;s true in Switzerland; and it&rsquo;s true in Northern Ireland, where Protestants and Catholics have traditionally lived in separate neighborhoods.</p>
<p> How unfortunate that liberals cannot or will not see or acknowledge that.</p>

		<p>I live in Belgium. A small (fake) country of Flemish people on one side and Walloons on the other. The only difference is language and minor cultural differences. Yet both groups do not get along at all.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years we (the Flemish) have been fighting for independence. <br>
We want our own country. <br>
We are sick of having to bend over to the French (the Walloon) side. <br>
Our taxes going to their side instead of our own people.<br>
Their left-wing politics (MORE immigrants and benefits for them) imposed on us (the more conservative side).</p>
<p>&hellip;And I can name a 1000 other reasons.</p>
<p>The point is; you can&rsquo;t put two (or more) different kinds of people together (even if both sides are white!) and expect brilliant results. Every moron with 2 braincells knows this.</p>
<p>Stragely I have received even bad responses here on AMREN from people who do not understand why Belgium is such a mess, and the Flemish side wants independence. They say we should get along and focus on the immigrants (or some other thing). They just don&rsquo;t seem to get it&hellip;</p>

		<p>Are you worried about your future as a Minoritized White Humanity in your own country? Pessimistic about the pernicious and dangerous Diversity that surrounds you and will be forcibly exported from the Africanism slums directly into your neighborhood by the Federal Housing and Urban Development? </p>
<p> If so, that&rsquo;s just more proof that you are infected with toxic and virulent White privilege (i.e. racist hate).   </p>
<p>In other words, if you even notice that things are getting worse for Whites like us, you must be so full of hateful and racist White privilege that you would dare feel or mention your discomfort.</p>
<p>Being dispossessed means you had something from which you could be dispossessed.  Just having something that a blacks wants in his eternal quest for Equality of Condition, means that you only possessed that item through White privilge.  The condition of &#8220;having something while White&#8221; is an indictment of racism (i.e. White privilge). </p>
<p>Folks, when complaining about the decline of America is pitched as something that is a marker of racism, especially during this tragic era when a charge of racism marks you as a legitimate target of social justice via robbery, rape, and murder, you know that the future looks worse than you&rsquo;ve yet imagined.   </p>
<p>If this story below doesn&rsquo;t make you bitterly cling to your guns and religion, and to reach out to &#8220;my people&#8221; White Humanity with survival instinct and social bond individualism, then go ahead and surrender and await your tortured fate.</p>
<p>We are all community activists now.</p>
<p>Whites are the real victims, and you know it.  We are victims of the Africanism tribal chiefs who colluded with Whitey yankee slavers to export the dangerous oversupply of Diversity in Africa to us so we would embrace the voodoo Diversity Curse. We are victims of Garrison, Lincoln, Douglas, Stevens, Sumner, Parks, King, Holder, Obama, and all the other enemies of our White Humanity&rsquo;s God given privilege of liberty.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amiable children of cannibals&hellip; who give us hideous slums and eternal apprehension of the future.&#8221;  Donald Davidson, &#8220;Still Rebels, Still Yankees&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Apprehensive?  Aw, shucks, that&rsquo;s just yo&rsquo; sweet little White privilege rear&rsquo;n its ugly head&hellip;</p>

<p>I love White victimology; such a sad and vulnerable people Whiteness has produced.</p>
<p>Black Americans are a people born of the absurd: tens of millions of folks taken from a continent, imprisoned in floating hellish dungeons, brought to a &ldquo;new world,&rdquo; killed and murdered by the millions (again), exploited as slave labor in the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;greatest democracy,&rdquo; who then create a new culture of their own while simultaneously gifting white America with our voice, insight, heart, intelligence, creativity, blood, martial spirit, and wisdom, and then struggling to enhance and improve the country&rsquo;s democracy while forcing the Constitution to live up to its fullest ideals for the benefit of all peoples. Talk about exhausting work.</p>
<p>As the Atlantic Monthly&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;Why Whites are More Pessimistic About their Future than Minorities&rdquo; highlights, it is no surprise that black folks are a hopeful people. We have a blues sensibility–one that is tempered with a coal-forged cynicism, that possesses a good deal of hopeful dreaming, and which features no so small amount of enduring hardheadedness and common sense.<br>

		<p>If ethnic diversity was a strength or desirable we&rsquo;d all know by now. </p>
<p>The concept of tribes or nation states would have vanished centuries ago as people chose to become multicultural and multiethnic instead. If it were true then the UN would have demanded that poor nations receive all asylum seekers first so that they could &#8221;benefit&#8221; from the resulting diversity. Also, we&rsquo;d see the rich and powerful moving into our most &#8221;enriched&#8221; areas.</p>

		<p>Alexander raises a good point with Belgium.  They have one group that is profiting from immigration and wants more of it against the wishes of the Flemish. Another point in Belgium, from what i have read, is election money comes from the government. I hear so many people screaming we should get corporate money out of elections and the government should provide the money for elections. This happened in Belgium, but the end result is the government also now decides who and what is a political party and tries to keep those like the Flemish that want less immigration from forming a party that represents people wanting less immigration from forming a party or running for office. Middle class respectable Belgians have been arrested for trying to create a party that represented themselves in Belgium politics.</p>
<p>Be careful what you wish for in getting money out of politics.<br>

		<p>What the authors of the study ALSO failed to take into account is that the Swiss citizenry are ARMED, heavily so.</p>
<p>Their national hero is William Tell and they are VERY proud of their marksmanship.</p>
<p>Even Hitler was afraid to invade this country of riflemen.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t survive the cold winters of the north by singing &#8216;Kumbaya&rsquo; with &#8220;others&#8221; around a roasting mastodon rib!  We survived by killing those who threatened our food supply and loved ones.  It was kill or be killed! (despite what the textbook revisionists would like us to believe!).  This instinct is in us.</p>
<p>Why is Switzerland so peaceful one might ask?</p>
<p><i>Switzerland, Europes&rsquo; most peaceful country, has no standing army. Instead, the country is defended by a militia composed of virtually all male citizens. The government issues rifles to these citizens, and the rifles are kept at their homes</i></p>
<p>Was this not the intent of the Founding Fathers of the United States?</p>
<p>Mr. Heinlein &#8220;groked&#8221; the obvious:</p>
<p><i>An armed society is a polite society. Manners are good when one may have to back up his acts with his life.</i></p>
<p>Strangers in strange lands did not survive!  Ask the Swiss who managed to stay out of both world wars while surrounded by the most blood thirsty regimes and human carnage  in history.  </p>
<p>Can I have a research grant now?  Actually, I don&rsquo;t have time, I&rsquo;m off to the rifle range to honor my Swiss heritage (really).</p>

Irish, Jewish and Italians are all white people. Switzerland and northern Ireland are (or used to be) white countries. <br>
Neutral areas work quite well until along comes a group of blacks, hooting, hollering, swaggering, playing their loud rap &#8220;music&#8221;, beating, raping and/or killing random others of any (white, or at least non-black) ethnicity&hellip; <br>
Peaceful, voluntary segregation with civilized neutral areas work fine as long as blacks are not part of the mix. They WILL NOT cooperate, not even out of sheer self-preservation. Much as we all might want to ignore this, we also all know it to be the truth.</p>

		<p>Did it really take a research group to figure this out! As for the government, they know exactly what&rsquo;s going on, it&rsquo;s called &#8220;Divide and Conquer&#8221; Take a look around and see all the gangs that have spread from New York to L.A. and everywhere in between. The Federal government gang task force are worried about the &#8220;number&rsquo;s&#8221; growing much faster with these gangs, then they can make arrests! You may not see this from your front porch now, but as sure as time marches on, these people will be in your neighborhood. Then what?</p>

&#8220;The biggest difference between Switzerland and most other racially diverse countries is that the Swiss are nearly all well-off. There is practically no poverty &mdash; except on some of the picturesque farms, where they still live in the stone age &mdash; and prefer it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Historically though, Switzerland, especially the German speaking mountain farmers were one of the poorest peasants in Europe.  They were so poor that they sent their young men out as mercenaries to other European countries. </p>
<p>Switzerland did not get going until the mid 18th century when international banking started.  The German mountain farming areas remained very poor until the mid 19th century tourism craze began.</p>
<p>The only reason there was never feudalism in Switzerland was that the country was nothing but subsistence farming for centuries.  Feudalism requires cash crops and a surplus to support the military feudal lords.  Switzerland never had a surplus.  That is also why the Austrian Empire never paid much attention to Switzerland.  There was never enough spare money for taxes. So Austria left it alone pretty much.  Think Appalachia without the coal mines. </p>
<p>Switzerland was really one of the poorest countries in Europe all those centuries it developed its live and let live culture.</p>
<p>Poverty did not matter. Genetics did.  Of course it was difficult to invade the next town when travel between towns involved climbing several 10,000 ft mountains.<br>

<p>A striking finding from our study is the consistent detection of 3–5% sub-Saharan African ancestry in the 8 diverse Jewish groups we studied, Ashkenazis (from northern Europe), Sephardis (from Italy, Turkey and Greece), and Mizrahis (from Syria, Iran and Iraq). This pattern has not been detected in previous analyses of mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome data [7], and although it can be seen when re-examining published results of STRUCTURE-like analyses of autosomal data, it was not highlighted in those studies, or shown to unambiguously reflect sub-Saharan African admixture [15], [38]. We estimate that the average date of the mixture of 72 generations (~2,000 years assuming 29 years per generation [30]) is older than that in Southern Europeans or other Levantines. </p>

<p>Again, the Caucasian form of man combines above the rest, strength of limb with activity of motion, enabling it to endure the greatest vicissitudes of temperature in all climates, to emigrate, colonise, and multiply in them, with the sole exception of the positive extremes. His longevity is more generally protracted, even in the midst of the enervating habits of high civilization his solid fibre gives a reasoned self possession and daring in vicissitudes arising from the passions, from accident, or from the elements, and his reflective power finds expedients to brave dangers with self possession and impunity.</p>
<p>The moral and intellectual character we find to be in unison with his structure, the reasoning powers outstripping the mere process of comparing sensations, and showing in volition more elevated thought, more reasoning, justice, and humanity; he alone of the races has produced examples of free and popular institutions, and his physical characteristics have maintained them in social life. By means of his logical intellect he has arrived at ideas requisite for the acquisition of abstract truths, resorting to actual experiment he fixed bases whereon to build demonstrable inferences when the positive facts are not otherwise shown.</p>
<p>He invented simple arbitrary characters to represent words and musical sounds, and a few signs which, nevertheless denote in their relative positions all the possible combinations of numbers and quantity. He has measured time and distance, making the sidereal bodies unerring guides to mark locality and give nautical direction. He has ascended to the skies, descended into the deep, and mastered the powers of the deep. By mechanical researches the bearded man has assuaged human toil, multiplied the results of industry, and created a velocity of locomotion superior to the flight of birds. By his chemical discoveries he has modified bodily pain, and produced numberless discoveries useful in medicine, in arts, and manufactures. He has formed a sound and connected system of the sciences in general, and acquired a critical literature, while for more than three thousand years he has been the principal possessor of all human knowledge, and the asserter of fixed laws. He has instituted all the great religious systems in the world, and to his stock has been vouchsafed the glory and the conditions of revelation.</p>
<p>The Caucasian type alone continues in rapid development, covering with nations every congenial latitude, and portending at no distant era to bear rule in every region, if not by physical superiority at least by that dominion which religion, science, and enterprise causes, constituting, as we have shown, the most important, the most elevated, and highly organized type of man.<br>

<p>That maybe true but you have to read the entire article&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;The History of African Gene Flow into Southern Europeans, Levantines, and Jews</p>
<p>Previous genetic studies have suggested a history of sub-Saharan African gene flow into some West Eurasian populations after the initial dispersal out of Africa that occurred at least 45,000 years ago. However, there has been no accurate characterization of the proportion of mixture, or of its date. We analyze genome-wide polymorphism data from about 40 West Eurasian groups to show that almost all Southern Europeans have inherited 1%–3% African ancestry with an average mixture date of around 55 generations ago, consistent with North African gene flow at the end of the Roman Empire and subsequent Arab migrations. Levantine groups harbor 4%–15% African ancestry with an average mixture date of about 32 generations ago, consistent with close political, economic, and cultural links with Egypt in the late middle ages. We also detect 3%–5% sub-Saharan African ancestry in all eight of the diverse Jewish populations that we analyzed. For the Jewish admixture, we obtain an average estimated date of about 72 generations. This may reflect descent of these groups from a common ancestral population that already had some African ancestry prior to the Jewish Diasporas.</p>
<p>Southern Europeans and Middle Eastern populations are known to have inherited a small percentage of their genetic material from recent sub-Saharan African migrations, but there has been no estimate of the exact proportion of this gene flow, or of its date. Here, we apply genomic methods to show that the proportion of African ancestry in many Southern European groups is 1%–3%, in Middle Eastern groups is 4%–15%, and in Jewish groups is 3%–5%. To estimate the dates when the mixture occurred, we develop a novel method that estimates the size of chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry in individuals of mixed ancestry. We verify using computer simulations that the method produces useful estimates of population mixture dates up to 300 generations in the past. By applying the method to West Eurasians, we show that the dates in Southern Europeans are consistent with events during the Roman Empire and subsequent Arab migrations. The dates in the Jewish groups are older, consistent with events in classical or biblical times that may have occurred in the shared history of Jewish populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Figure S5.</p>
<p>Geographic gradient of African ancestry in Europeans. Sub-Saharan African ancestry proportions were estimated using f4 Ancestry Estimation. Populations in grey are estimated to have sub-Saharan African ancestry between 1–4%. The * in Switzerland indicates that the three populations available from this country have variable estimates: Swiss-Germans show no evidence of African mixture, Swiss-French 0.5±0.2% and Swiss-Italians 1.6±0.2%. The &lsquo;+&rsquo; sign in Italy indicates that multiple samples were available but all show evidence of African mixture. No data are available from countries filled with diagonal lines.

<p>Meaning the gene flow of African ancestry went into different population groups including Southern Europeans (who would then have to consider non white). All the article is showing an is a higher gradient of admixture from Africa outward. The farther form it you get (like Northern Europe) the less you get. This is supporting the Out-Of-Africa theory.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #34, I was referring to older females who have never worked and therefore have not paid into the system, and younger males and females who are on disability for ONE back injury that does not leave them physically incapable of say, a desk job. They certainly can shop all day and lift heavy objects.  They&rsquo;re amazingly dextrous.  If I were the government, I&rsquo;d be watching this show closely for fraud.   Also, I am sorry, but I don&rsquo;t believe anyone short of a complete case of schizophrenia should be on disability for mental illness.  There are people on LIFETIME Social Security benefits beginning at younger and younger ages and I am merely crying, &#8220;abuse&#8221;.  By the way, if you&rsquo;re under 45, you won&rsquo;t likely be receiving benefits at 65 even if you HAVE been paying into the system all your life.

		<p>Look, just because a percentage of a particular race&rsquo;s genome has evidenced ancient African gene-flow, does not mean such a race is African.  </p>
<p>Eventually, over generations that tiny element of genetic ad-mixture becomes diluted to the point of being negligible and at some point ceases to exercise any phenotypical influence on future generations where reproduction has since been confined to one race only.  Yes, there may be inherited but antiquated health/personality-related traits still persisting.</p>
<p>The fact is, that that race of people are a separate race and possess their own distinct genetic identity regardless.</p>
<p>When it comes to the question of territory, the original bearers of the ancient or more recent gene-flow don&rsquo;t have any entitlement or claim on that of their mixed descendants either.<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard in Switzerland that the property is so expensive that most must rent. Also, salaries there are modest and cost of living is very high. In some cantons, the only middle class property owners are those who bought before the early 70s. I&rsquo;ve read that Switzerland is the most racially diverse country in Europe with the most immigration. Also, every drug you can imagine is legal, and they have socialized medicine. It is common to see dirt bags smoking dope in the park and junkies shooting up in the public restrooms.  Switzerland is still beautiful, but it isn&rsquo;t perfect like we are lead to believe.</p>

President Lincoln   &mdash;   the Real Lincoln, that is   &mdash;   was a race realist.  He actively sought repatriation of all freed black slaves to Africa, something to which even his most stringent neo-Confederate critics (like Thomas DiLorenzo) admit.

Well, this means that Lincoln wished to have all Blacks repatriated.  He clearly foresaw that failure to do so would fester into an ever larger problem.  While topical pressures <br>
during the War came front and center to his attention, it appears his concern for repatriation was second to no other concerns.  Lincoln, BTW, like most educated people of his time  &mdash;  and the moreso among those with actual frontier experience  &mdash;  was a firm hereditarian. He speculated that his own remarkable level of intellectual ability stemmed from the fact that his mother had been sired out of wedlock by a wealthy and well-educated planter whose identity was unknown to him.    </p>

The orignial slaveowners are DEAD, and most of us are descended from people  who  came to this country after the Civil War.  Incidentally too, this country wasn&rsquo;t the first country to end slavery nor the last; but it was the ONLY country to fight a civil war largely because of it.  As for racism, anything you people hear that you don&rsquo;t like is &#8220;racist&#8221;.  As for caring what you or any other black person call me, I really could care LESS at this point in time.  For years, I&rsquo;ve had to live around your race&rsquo;s nonstop problems including a large amount of pathology, dishonesty, noise and the total disregard for the rights and feelings of others.  As for you people complaining about the lack of jobs, having been in the skilled trades, well I ve seen how largely you have done it to yourselves by refusing to work hard, have a good attitude while on the job, and coming in late all of the time.  Seems to me like your race also has a general, universal lack of understanding of economics.  Affirmative action is frequently the only way you get jobs; not by fairly competing against other appilicants.  Finallly, I&rsquo;m so sick and tired of hearing about your race&rsquo;s obsession with being dragged to this country.  Having been to Africa, I&rsquo;m very well aware of how your race has ruined Zimbabwe and South Africa.  So maybe like other whites, despite the present regime we have, I don&rsquo;t want to hear the nonstop whining you people do about this country.  Believe me, there are many places in Asia and Africa which are a lot worse.  As for youor nonstop &#8220;oppression&#8221;, yes, you can claim about 400 years in this country, but as being Jewish on one side of the family, I can claim 5000.  Incidentally, that includes Holacaust survivors who are stll alive in my dad&rsquo;s side of the family.  Get the point?  We&rsquo;re sick of your race&rsquo;s nonstop feeling of entititlement and attempts to turn this country into a third world one.</p>

		<p><b>&ldquo;The biggest difference between Switzerland and most other racially diverse countries is that the Swiss are nearly all well-off.

<p>Not to mention the Swiss did not and will not give up their firearms.  Do you think a bunch of muslims and nonwhites want to go there and stir up trouble knowing that they&rsquo;ll be dealing with an army, cops and a well-armed citizenry?  I think not.</p>

		<p>How it is that there is such a will to live together among the Swiss, and relatively the opposite among the Belgians, specially among the Flemish ones ?<br>
There are several reasons, the main one seeming to me this one :<br>
The French and the German languages have about the same statuses, being big european languages, so the german-speaking Swiss make the effort to learn French, and the French-speaking Swiss make the effort to learn German. Whereas Flemish (Dutch) languadoes not have this status. So, the Flemish learn French at school (and English) whereas the Wallons do not learn Flemish. This asymetry of efforts irritates the Flemish. Hence the bad will, the will to separate. Were German the language spoken by the not-Wallons, there would not be this hostility. In general French (like me) do not find so legitimate the existence of Belgium, and are very open to Flemish independantism (and wallon &#8220;rattachisme&#8221; (to France)).</p>

<p>God wants us dead.  Or Satan overpowered God in 1965 and is now running the universe.  Only explanation that makes sense.<br>
46 years is all it took to send us on our way to extinction.</p>
<p>It is certainly not because God is punishing us for not being charitable and good and kind to strangers.  We&rsquo;ve been much too good and charitable to strangers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;He ( Lincoln) actively sought repatriation of all freed black slaves to Africa, something to which even his most stringent neo-Confederate critics (like Thomas DiLorenzo) admit. Blame John Wilkes Booth, if you will, for the current spate of black flash mobs. &#8220;</p>
<p>I have never believed that Lincoln was sincere.  </p>
<p>I always thought it was just another election promise that helped him get elected for his second term.   Like Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s second term election promise &#8220;He kept us out of war&#8221; and a year later Americans were dying in France. </p>
<p>Lincoln sought repatriation but could not find one country that would take them  Haiti did not want them.  The abolitionists and Douglas refused to consider Haiti because an earlier attempt to settle freed men in Haiti failed.  The Haitians simply enslaved the American blacks in horrible conditions.</p>
<p>Lincoln really tried hard to convince the Central American countries to take our blacks. The C. American countries&rsquo; ambassadors absolutely refused to even consider it.  Of course they lived in DC so they were very familiar with blacks.<br>
The Europeans did not want them in the Carribbean colonies.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if Lincoln ever asked Liberia which would have been the logical place.</p>
<p>I regard the stories that Lincoln had a sincere intention to move blacks out of the US with scepticism.  He made those promises during his 1964 election.  The working class was worried about the influx of blacks from the south competing for jobs.  </p>
<p>The country as a whole was getting very tired of a long war with so many dead, the crooked war profiteers, and the small businesses and farmers whose men were fighting going under because the men were gone.</p>
<p>Lincoln was committed to complete reconciliation after the war.</p>
<p>He wanted the cotton trade with Europe resumed as soon as possible.  That would have needed cheap black labor from the former slaves. Remember cotton was like oil in the mid 19th century.  Natchez Miss in the 1840&rsquo;s had more millionaires than any city on earth. </p>
<p>He and his generals were very concerned about a long term guerrilla warfare with diehard confederate camps in the mountains and forests.  That was the reason for Sherman&rsquo;s march and other destruction, unconditional surrender.  No revanchism.</p>
<p>Lincoln and his generals wanted  to end the war with unconditional submission and compliance from the south.  Had he taken the freed men from their former owners the slave holders might very well have started another war this time with Britian and France allied with the south.  </p>
<p>Remember, France occupied Mexico at the time, just in case the south won.  Both southern and French  forward thinking envisaged a Confederate States Mexican union. The English sent several hundred thousand soldiers to Canada for no reason but to be there ready for invasion if the north became weak enough.</p>
<p>Britian and France stayed neutral, but the troops were sent to take advantage of any break up of the union or northern weakness.</p>
<p>Had he lived Lincoln would never have sent the freed men to another country.</p>
<p>First, no country would take them.</p>
<p>Second, the southern upper classes wanted that cheap freed men labor and might have continued the revolt had Lincoln taken the freedmen away.</p>
<p>Never would have happened.</p>
<p>In some ways the former slave owners benefitted.  Free labor was much cheaper in that they did not have to take care of the elderly. The freedmen&rsquo;s  pay was far cheaper than the room, board and clothing the slaves had. </p>

<p>Really? God did not set the boundries for the European nations or the USA?  It was MAN that messed with the borders that God set up&hellip;HE also set up America for the tribes to come and build this land for their own race of people&hellip; just as he did Canada. He also set up China for the Chinese, Africa for Africans,  etc.etc&hellip;</p>
<p>As for your last sentence, make some sense will you?</p>

I am unaware of the scholarship on this matter. The topic is not<br>
very PC and would be inherently career-risky on campus these days. But some commentary suggests that Lincoln&rsquo;s acts and omissons relevant to this matter suggest pretty strongly that he did believe deeply in it and viewed the continued presence of Blacks in American society as being as inimical to Union and secession was.  He seems implicitly to have believed Blacks profoundly  &mdash;  as a group/ on average  &mdash;  less innately intelligent than whites.   He had been an outspoken supporter of re-settlement from his first term as a Congressman, many years before the War.  </p>
