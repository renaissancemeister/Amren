		<p>I thought it was the usual Buchanan talk: very concerned and thoughtful, but he won&rsquo;t go into race. He was asked what he meant by the end of civilization&hellip;because whites will no longer be a mahority? No, Pat backpedaled and sidestepped, it means that the majority culture&rsquo;s values will change, there will be a balkanization of America&hellip;I wisk Buchanan would just come out and say white people are losing the country and it&rsquo;s bad. He just won&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>I guess the speaking fees and guest spots are too good to turn down, but Pat&rsquo;s had his day, and he should go to the Northwest and say it&rsquo;s time for a separate white homeland, come and join me. This country is beyond reforming or saving.</p>

		<p>Saw it - classic Fox News/Hannity. Hannity was scandalized for his viewers that the White Race should even be mentioned socially. The only geramne question is how the passing of the White Race would effect the Republican Party. He knew that even to ask such a question is to imply that the White Race might have some unique relationship to America. Of course Pat plays along as he must, the whole thing a complete charade for the benefit of morons.</p>

		<p>Pat Buchannan stated on the George Noory show last night that he would enthusiastically crank up legal immigration levels again as soon as the unemployment level dropped below six percent(this is Peter Brimelow&rsquo;s moratorium)-as if a severe labor scarcity would be terrible thing for Native Born White Americans which it obvious wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;And as a consequence, make it a complete certainty that Native Born White Americans would be race-replaced at the hands of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>Pat Buchannan was tutored on the virtues of the immigration moratorium by Peter Brimelow. </p>
<p>Immigration moratorium=race-replacement. Pat Buchannan is not the least bit serious about reversing Native Born White American race-replacement.</p>
<p>I will not concede an inch to the race replacement enthusiasts.</p>

		<p>Hannity is a coward in this conversation as are so many others.<br>
I real tire of listening to this type of tiptoeing around the racial issues all the while pretending to address them.</p>
<p>Buchanan says some people talk as if the destruction/replacement of white people IS the goal  &mdash;    &mdash;  WELL OF COURSE THAT IS EXACTLY the PURPOSE.</p>
<p>Race matters and racial interests matter.  <br>
Whites have a right to protet their identity and control over their territory.</p>
<p>This is what free people want.</p>
<p>Hannity keeps trying to &#8216;work around&rsquo; the race issue and avoid the -heaven forbid-  that whites DO need to have a place where they are in control and are a clear majority.</p>
<p>I am tired of these interviews where race is discussed and then delegitimized and turned into just a cultural issue  (all to avoid the dreaded racism)   &mdash;   all the while accepting the racist notion that the destruction of a whites in and off itself is &#8216;no big deal&rsquo;  if the country survives.  </p>

		<p>The long march through the institutions by the &#8220;cultural left&#8221; was observable from the 1960s onwards and can be documented at every stage, at any rate in the USA and UK.  The Marcuseans and their comrades thought white workers too bourgeois to make the revolution, so that bations had to be broken by &#8220;minorities&#8221; demanding &#8220;equality&#8221; - &#8220;wimmin&#8221;, immigrants, &#8220;gays&#8221;, ethnics, the &#8220;disabled&#8221;, etc.  I followed the impact on &#8220;race relations&#8221; in Britain as a personal observer within their subversive operations and as a collector of the evidence of their &#8220;agenda networking&#8221; through local government, journalism, academia, TV and especially schools.  It was very difficult to altert &#8220;conservative&#8221; politicians to the problem; they lacked interest, shared a supposedly similar &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; perspective, or dismissed concerns as paranoia, extremism, etc.  Now some writers have woken up, and dared voice opposition, in Britain, people like Leo McKinstry, Melanie Phillips and Peter Hitchens.<br>
Though belated, there is a breakthrough into mainstream media, as the grim effects of the &#8220;revolution&#8221; can be seen and felt. but the problem is now securing the policy and will to halt the decline and to reverse the process. It will be a great pity if it has to take more burning cities at a time of economic austerity for decisive action to be taken. Meanwhile, it is vital for us across the pond to share intelligence, seek common ground, and advise one another on effective action.</p>

		<p>I saw this. And as much as I admire Pat and agree with his ideas, I have to say he gave in a little on this interview. Hannity asked him if he thought that only whites could maintain a good society (paraphrasing) and Pat backed off a little bit. His answer, of course, should have been a loud, resounding YES!!! There are only 3 non white countries on this planet that are decent places to live: Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (with the first world Chinese populated &#8220;city-states&#8221; of Hong Kong and Singapore thrown in). This is not an accident. It is due to the fact that Whites and North Asians are the only races on this planet evolved enough to be able to form advanced civilizations. All others, especially the blacks, are basically barely more evolved than the original Homo Erectus.</p>

		<p>In this interview Mr. Buchanan spells out clearly what awaits our country as whites become the minority.  We become a poorer, more divided, Third-World country with high levels of social pathology.  Hannity presses Buchanan on the fact that you cannot maintain the America of the past with a population of non-whites.  Buchanan hedges painfully over and over again to talk about culture and values and &#8220;what binds us together.&#8221;  Who made America at the inception?  Whites.  Who has built the freest and most prosperous country?  Whites.  Who are the greatest inventors and greatest innovators?  Whites.  So, if the country becomes minority white with a newly established mongrel majority, can all those great things about this country be maintained?  The answer is no.  Look around the world for evidence.  </p>
<p>I wish Buchanan would embrace the naked fact that as whites decrease as a percentage of the population it decreases in all aspects of what makes it great.  He tip-toes around the central issue&hellip; that is whites make the best societies, the best economies and the best, basically, of everything in the world.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say they &#8220;discussed&#8221; it so much as they danced around it! Neither seems willing to acknowledge what it is Pat is implying, if not saying outright. When the direct topic of race is brought up, they both default back to politics, ideology and what have you - as if those things aren&rsquo;t DIRECTLY a result of racial-groups and the ideas that originate with those people. </p>
<p>Still, if it plants a few seeds in Hannity&rsquo;s otherwise clueless audience, that is obviously a positive.  </p>

		<p>An extraordinarily lame and pathetic interview.    Confirms every ounce of contempt that I have harbored for the nauseating Sean Hannity and every other establishment &#8216;neo-con&rsquo; of similar ilk.<br>
As for Buchanan, the man flat out blew a golden opportunity to point out the racial reality of what sort of society exists in every corner of the Third World, where blacks or mestizos or literally any other non-white group is dominant and in control of the nation in question.    Hannity gave Buchanan every chance to exhibit the presence of a spine and to speak honestly and truthfully about race, and every time - Patty girl ran away like a scalded cat.  But, then - Hannity and Buchanan are both terrified to dare mention that whites, just like every other ethnic group, have legitimate ethnic-specific interests and that those interests will most certainly not be served or addressed if whites are reduced to a minority and placed under the thumb of hostile non-whites inside their own native homelands.</p>
<p>Notice that neither one of these wimps bothered to bring up the fact that Whites were never asked by their ruling elites if they wanted to adopt an immigration policy that is clearly designed to genocide White European people.  This was done without our permission and it is being done for diabolically evil and malicious purposes - and it is clearly in violation of the 1947/1948 Convention on the Crime and Punishment of Genocide.  </p>
<p>Conclusion:  A pair of gutless white cowards convene and have a conversation whereby they both try to out-wimp each other and seize the Gold Medal for being the biggest White Wussy.</p>
<p>A sickening performance.   Our race needs far better spokesman and leaders than these two gutless toads.</p>

		<p>Hannity is not a race realist and never was. He is a multi-cult. He HATES to talk about what is happening to the White race, period. Pat always disappoints me in his interviews. He is demonized as a racist anyway so why not SHOW them just how &#8220;racist&#8221; you really are, Pat? Stand up and be a WHITE MAN!</p>
<p>I quit watching and listening to Hannity 4 years ago. The same with O&rsquo;Reilly and all of Fox news. They are the race deluded channel. Whites will never wake up (as is intended) watching and listening to Fox News.</p>

		<p>As several people here have already pointed out, Buchanan really blew it in this interview. He could have easily responded to Hannity&rsquo;s question by stating the following: &#8220;Only White Americans can build a better society for White Americans..and the evidence for this is obvious..How could White Americans possibly be made better of by being race-replaced by a rapidly growing, hostile and heavily armed nonwhite majority?&#8221; Followed up with: &#8220;Why should Native Born White Americans be in favor of being a racial minority within the borders of America?&#8221; Buchanan could have called NY mayor and greedy billionaire Michael Bloomberg a bold-face liar when he said America can&rsquo;t survive without importing Asians. Buchanan should have defended the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1888</p>
<p>But what did you expect from someone who stated the previous night on the George Noory show that he would enthusiastically crank up nonwhite immigration after unemployment drops below six percent? This is a blueprint to race-replace Native Born White Americans. At best, Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s new book can be viewed as an obituary of Native Born White America. Of course, what we need at this point in time is a highly racialized equivalent of Tom Paine&rsquo;s &#8220;Common Sense&#8221;..we need a book that pulls no punches,that stays unrelentingly focused on the race-replacement issue..and that incites millions of Native Born What Americans to rebel against race-replacement. Advocating a moratorium and trying to save the Republican Party-as vdare.com is trying to do-is a manifestly losing strategy.</p>
<p>No one should underestimate and understate just how dire the situation is for Native Born White American&hellip;nothing short of calling for a full-blown race-revolt against race-replacement is acceptable at this point in time. Pat Buchanan wants to keep Mexicans out of America because they don&rsquo;t score high enough on IQ tests..I want to keep them out because they are Mexican and therefore not our kind.</p>

		<p>If it is okay for Soledad O&rsquo;Brien and other minorities/liberals to cheer the power and demographic decline of white America, why is it not okay for white America to want to stay strong  &mdash;  both demographically and influentially?</p>
<p>In other words, it is okay to speak of whites as a group only if you want them to receive some &#8220;just punishment&#8221; for daring to be a majority and build the greatest republic ever seen in the history of civilization.  </p>
<p>Pat and Sean both understand that Western values, culture, the Constitution, and individual liberty made the country what it was.  What they don&rsquo;t quite get, is that these things are unique to whites  &mdash;  originating from Protestant Western Europe in particular.  </p>
<p>The interview was telling, and Buchanan shouldn&rsquo;t have backed down.  If people like Hannity cannot be convinced that white culture needs to be defended, who can?</p>

<p>I woke up to that fact a long time ago. They are controlled opposition. Same as the Republican Party is. We all know what the marxist Democrat Party stands for (White genocide) so they had to get the Republican Party on board with their agenda.</p>

		<p>For those attacking these guys for evading the race, I just want to say that it is easy to promote race realism from behind your computer. Buchanan and Hannity are doing the best they can from their positions. If they came right out and said what many of you are advocating, the would be marginalized along with us, and would never be able to reach a broader audience. Reaching a broader audience is more important than preaching to the choir. Any intelligent White person hearing this understands the implied racial implications. </p>

		<p>Buchanan gave a short telephone interview on the local radio station this morning. These are baby steps, yet a titanic amount of progress has been made in the past few months if you really think about it.</p>
<p>Respectable whites are discussing race without fear of being immediately shut down. I scanned the dial later, on the way to work, and heard more than one morning host expounding on the simple fact that blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crime and are a net drain on the system, apparently without fear of losing their station&rsquo;s FCC license.</p>
<p>The emperor is naked; everyone knows that. Pointing it out, albeit in a roundabout way, is becoming more mainstream. There may yet be hope!</p>

		<p>I too was disappointed in the Buchanan interview but I expected to be.  We know that Pat knows what we know, but he doesn&rsquo;t come out and say it exactly.  He basically said we should have a moratorium and let the third-worlders in our country catch up in the civilization department and they will become Patriots too.  I don&rsquo;t think Pat believes that for a second.  Remember,he was marginalized, but not destroyed for not being an Israel-firster.  Just imagine what would happen if he told this truth in explicit terms.  But there&rsquo;s no doubt he could have gone further without totally destroying himself.  Hannity is a  neoCON tool/fool and tried to dance around and derail a bit.  Maybe there were ground rules because Fox, Murdoch and Ailes are politically correct?  Does anyone here think Hannity really believes that third-worlders and the underclass in our country just need a tax cut, nice job and a home to become patriotic Americans?  This afternoon Pat was on Fox with Megyn Kelly for a short interview.  It was an even worse interview.  She doesn&rsquo;t buy into any of it but was not rude.  Back to Hannity for a second&hellip;this jerk (and Coulter) said the London riots had nothing to do with race.  It was just about the economy.        </p>

		<p>In 1964 if the Blacks would have been honest and said we want to have sex with White women, we want to be placed in jobs ahead of qualified White men, we want to get into White neighborhoods and schools so we can rob, beat, rape, and kill White people, and we want White people thrown into prison for telling the truth about our degenerate behavior, would the 1964 Civil Rights Act have passed?<br>
<p><br>
If Pat Buchanan would be totally honest and say that Blacks are incorrigible and can never in a million years adapt to our culture, that they don&rsquo;t belong here, in fact all non-Whites do not belong in America and we must benignly get rid of the them now, how many people would listen to him?<br>
<p><br>
Pat&rsquo;s job is like our job: convert the pagans that worship the Politically Correct god.             Remember we are dealing with some people that actually believe in racial equality.  We know that there are seeming normal people like Nina Tayloe.    <br>
<p><br>
Do ever wonder why so many pro-Black / anti-White pundits go spastic when Pat is allowed to publicly say obvious truths about Blacks, even when he generously compliments Blacks?  It is because he is doing a good job of converting. <br>
<p><br>
Take a page out of Pat&rsquo;s missionary book.  Be kind to fellow White non-believers.  Do not use the N-word in their presence, feign compassion, but give them the facts.<br>

		<p>To those posters, #23, #26 and #27 as a couple of them&hellip;.  who want us to lighten up and take baby steps with mentioning anything to do with RACE, and tell the truths, I suggest that if you feel that way and that Whites as a race, are so weak and so cowardly as to be NOT able to handle the truth for once, (especially since the sun has already set on the White race) then are they really ready to be saved from themselves in the first place?  Or do we even want them?  We have been taking baby steps for 50 years or more!  When are they going to learn how to walk?</p>
<p>MOST Whites will not wake up (I don&rsquo;t care how delicately you put it to them) and it will only be 10% at the most who are the real fighters and who want to survive in the first place. Isn&rsquo;t it kind of late in the game to go wimpy now and not mention the racial aspect of our destruction?  How long do we wait? Another year? Another 20 years? How long?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hannity is a coward in this conversation as are so many others.<br>
I real tire of listening to this type of tiptoeing around the racial issues all the while pretending to address them&#8221;</p>
<p>Hannity is much worse than just a coward. He is a race traitor to the nth degree.He is also a crook. The neutral organization that rates charities on how much money actually goes to the needy. Hannity so-called charities to veterans and the like rated an F. Things like taking all his friends on private jets with jacuzzis and the like. This out if money his moronic Fox viewers donate because they believe Sean the snake oil salesman.</p>
<p>It is ironic that Sean would falsely try to help veterans when he is one of the Neocons getting them sent to useless wars in the first place. Will you Conservatives on AR finally admit you are dead wrong about Conservatism being the answer to anything. It is actually the opposite it is the cause of the problem. <br>
How many times do you see Jared Taylor on the mainstream media. Never. That is how you know somebody is bought and paid for if they are allowed on the MSM. People like Buchanan, person who knows what the real problem is but would rather accumulate millions even at over 70 with no children.</p>
<p>The only hope we Whites have is to emulate Occupy Wall Street. Get crowds of people together, people who totally reject the current system.People who only worry about White America. Period.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t expect any media personality with television and book deals to protect to carry the torch for our white race. Pat seems to be the only one within the MSM even willing to dance with this issue.  Nobody else is even in the building.  Pat has taken it as far as he can without crossing the line and jeopardizing his coffers and it will be up to us to continue the struggle to save our race. </p>
<p>As for Hannity, I gave up on this hack when he started licking the boots of Al Sharpton on air.   <br>

<p><br>
<b>There are none so blind as those who will not see. </b>    </p>
<p><br>
But these, including Buchanan,  are also people who have lucrative media positions to protect.  They are making a lot of money and they enjoy prestige and fame. That&rsquo;s very nice for them.  As some have said above, they are used as &#8220;Controlled Opposition&#8221;.   Whether they like it or not, they have to bear in mind  where their paychecks come from. </p>
<p>They surely do  know that if they spoke out honestly,  the Powers That Be  would remove them instantly, and they would be unheard of nobodies as of tomorrow morning. Unpublishable nobodies in search of employment. Has beens with no prospects. So they tiptoe around the issues and pretend they are unaware of race.  &hellip;. (&#8220;Huh! Race? What does this have to do with race???&#8221;)</p>
<p>Thus it all comes down to control of the media, much more so than who says what.  THAT is the essential problem that we face. And nobody dares discuss it. It is much more taboo than race.</p>

		<p>Dear BEBE, <br>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t want to be cruel, but you sound like a typical Black; a child that wants whatever he wants NOW.<br>
<p><br>
We want to win.  It may well take 20 years to complete the win, but now we must do what is doable.  We don&rsquo;t own Hollywood, we don&rsquo;t own TV, newspapers, magazines, and we don&rsquo;t even own the internet.<br>
<p><br>
We are where the Blacks were in 1950.  We need people with obvious good character selling the pro-White position.  As it stand now the anti-White forces control the mainstream media and they give normal White people the image of the pro-White man as a Nazi, K, skinhead.  <br>
<p><br>
You screaming your head off that the Blacks are raping and killing Whites in not going to do it.  Be smart.  Show them that being pro-White is cool.  Show them that the image of you as a hate filled wacko is simply impossible to be true.  <br>
<p><br>
To the choir you can be frank, but to the indoctrinated unwashed only a good man can forgive them their mortal sin of wickedness to the Blacks.  They need their White guilt absolve.  <br>
<p><br>
To them you must say, &ldquo;I love Black people.  There are many wonderful Blacks.  It is just that we are so different from them.  So many of them and so many of us cannot get along together.  They need to have their own space and we need to have ours.&rdquo;<br>
<p><br>
You are not asking much, just fairness.  A baby step. <br>

<p>Your assumtion that Sean Hannity is own our side is false. He is a Republican Party Toady. The only question is whether Pat Buchannan still is. Pat has nothing to lose if he didn&rsquo;t pull his punches. He is financially secure. His book has it the stores..what does has he have to lose? Either he is a leader or he isn&rsquo;t. The fact of the matter is, he has conceded way to much to the race-replaement enthusiasts and this is very dangerous. I mean, this is is his fourth book already..how much longer is he going to pull his punches. And by the way, if he didn&rsquo;t pull his punches, his book sales would increase exponentially&hellip;best seller-number one for a year at least. This of of course, would emboldened Native Born White Americans to publicly speak out&hellip;safety in numbers effect. The fact of the matter is Pat Buchannan is blowing an incredible oportunity to incite a revolt against race-replacement..instead, effectively he advocates race-replacement through the immigration  moratorium.</p>

		<p>If  Pat Buchanan 1)called for a complete shutdown of all nonwhite immigration down to 0 ; 2)stated that the intent of post-1965 immigration policy was make Native Born White Americans a small racial minority within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221; surrounded by a heavily armed and hostile nonwhite majority; 3)stated that post-1965 nonwhites were the number one threat to the America&rsquo;s environment,ecosystems and endangered spieces and; 4)stated that a severe labor scarcity induced by a complete shutdown of all nonwhite immigration would be a great benefit to millions of Native Born White Americans. Even if Buchanan didn&rsquo;t state this in his book, but stated it in every interview for  the book..believe me, Pat Buchanan would not be ignored by the msm media&hellip;.just the opposite would be true&hellip;</p>
<p>As I suspected, Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s book was composed of Steve Sailer policy wonk analysis direct from Steve Sailer himself..so now they can go have a policy wonk debate in a room at the Brookings Institute..in the mean time, race-replaement continues apace.</p>
<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s new book lacks  gut-level-visceral anger and rage against race-replacement, the very thing required to incite a revolt against race-replacement. Instead he calls for policies that would help assimilate Mexicans, Pakistanis,Hindus and Koreans..why would he want to do that?&hellip;we need to get rid of them.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a few days ago, my  niece was almost brutally raped by large black male. I found out today that it was a very very close call. Why White Men sit in football stadiums and basketball arenas..given the epidemic number of black male sexual assaults on White Women-is beyond my comprehension.</p>

		<p> <i>It was very difficult to alert &ldquo;conservative&rsquo; politicians to the problem; they lacked interest, shared a supposedly similar &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; perspective, or dismissed concerns as paranoia, extremism, etc.</i></p>
<p>Too little to late for Britain (us too in the US, BTW) due to disparate birth rates. It is going to take blood shed to set this right.</p>
<p>Churchill fought a losing battle to keep Britain White way back in 1955 as did Conservative Cyril Osborne. </p>
<p><i>Winston Churchill battled in cabinet against appeasers of Commonwealth leaders but was old and ailing. He wanted the Conservative party to adopt the slogan &#8216;Keep England White&rsquo; . A Bill was drafted&hellip;but was not ready till June 1955, two months after Churchill had stood down.</i></p>
<p><i>Cyril Osborne warned in 1955 &#8216;What shall we do when the world&rsquo;s poor swarm to Britain&rsquo;s welfare honey pot. We have neither the room nor the resources to take all who would like to come.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><b>Both sides of the House laughed at him and called him Fascist.</b></p>
<p><i>In 1958 Osborne pleaded with the Conservatives to consider the future consequences of mass immigration. When they refused to listen this genuine and sincere man broke down and wept. In March 1965 he told the House,&rsquo;Our children and grandchildren will curse us for our moral cowardice!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Interestingly, Pat Buchanan writes in The Unnecessary War:</p>
<p><i>&#8216;Had Churchill endured in office,&rsquo; Buchanan writes, &#8216;London would look entirely different today.&rsquo;  When, in 1955, Churchill retired as prime minister, he &#8216;was no longer able to lead a campaign to &#8216;Keep England White&rsquo;</i></p>
