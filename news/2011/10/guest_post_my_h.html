			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lori, Feministing, October 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>By now, I&rsquo;m sure most of you have heard about Occupy Wall Street. Inspired by Adbuster&rsquo;s call for action in July, protesters have occupied Zuccotti Park near Wall Street in New York City since September 17th. {snip}</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street&rsquo;s General Assembly operates under a revolutionary &#8220;progressive stack.&#8221; A normal &#8220;stack&#8221; means those who wish to speak get in line. A progressive stack encourages women and traditionally marginalized groups speak before men, especially white men. This is something that has been in place since the beginning, it is necessary, and it is important.</p>
<p>&#8220;Step up, step back&#8221; was a common phrase of the first week, encouraging white men to acknowledge the privilege they have lived in their entire lives and to step back from continually speaking. This progressive stack has been inspiring and mind-boggling in its effectiveness. {snip}</p>
<p>On October 1st, the Occupied Wall Street Journal, founded by Arun and Jed of Indypendent and supported by over $40,000 of Kickstarter funds was released. {snip}</p>
<p>Hopefully The Occupied Wall Street Journal will abide by the zeitgeist of this movement, which is radical inclusivity. Anything claiming to represent the General Assembly should be subject to the same governing principles, which would include a progressive stack. If this is a revolution of white men, it will not succeed.</p>
<p>In the words of Kevin Alvarez, a Latino blogger and activist who has been occupying wall street for over a week now:</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the voices of the disenfranchised people of color, lgbtq, differently abled, and other marginalized groups then this will become a revolution of those with privilege against those with privilege. There is a difference between revolutionary change and just being allowed access to the power, status, and wealth of the dominant culture. And Occupy Wall Street should not be co-opted by those seeking a watered down version of this systematically murderous economic and political system.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;radical inclusivity&#8221;</p>
<p>- So who gets to speak first, males or females.  If they say males (non-white) then they are sexist pigs seeking to marginalize the voices of women.  If they say females, then they are sexist pigs subscribing to gender stereotypes and old, archaic forms of patronizing.  </p>
<p>- So (whatever gender) gets to speak first, what will the heirarchy of speakers be next?  Should gays or straights speak first?  If gays, then straights are not being respected.  If straights, then they are oppressing the voices of the rainbow coalition.</p>
<p>- What about groups that have not been &#8216;marginalized&rsquo;, simply because they have not been here very long?  What about lesbian Nepalese immigrants?  What about a chinese guy who studied hard in school and got a good job?  Could he be a speaker, or is he not authentic?  What about the &#8216;ugly&rsquo; people versus the &#8216;attractive&rsquo; people?  You know there is a lot of talk about trying to fight discrimination against the &#8216;ugly&rsquo;, who are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>When I first heard about liberalism being a form of mental illness, I didn&rsquo;t believe a political orientation could be like that.  Then I lived around fruits-and-nuts liberals for the last ten years.  Most liberals are really looney in a way that I find hard to understand.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a mix of over-protective motherhood on steroids (everybody&rsquo;s a winner here!), illogic (people are breaking the law to enter my country, come on in and make my land a third world hell hole!) and masochism (I am &#8216;priviledged so I will fight to make myself poor).</p>
<p>The bad part, if it isn&rsquo;t bad enough, is that this radical marxist-flavored ideology does nothing by tear our once great nation down, and the worse it gets, the more they scream for &#8216;social justice,&rsquo; when they are the ones causing the downfall and poverty with fostering dependency on government programs (which ruined the black community), unrestricted immigration of illiterate peasants (latinos, somalis, etc) and a bizarre hatred of all things American and white (have you seen what they teach in the schools these days?)</p>

		<p>What, pray tell, it this utterly incoherent and incomprehensible babbling?</p>
<p>This is even worse than the Sixties, which I thought at the time represented a never-again achievable low point in incoherent raving, which I&rsquo;d always rather assumed to be the result of excessive drug use by the demonstrators.</p>

		<p>Did you ever notice that it&rsquo;s the kind of White men who don&rsquo;t contribute much to the creation of so-called White privilege who are the ones who cry about it being undeserved?  They tend not to be the engineers, builders, architects, inventors, carpenters, programmers, mechanics, repairman, etc., who are the ones responsible for it.</p>

		<p>White women made a bad choice by throwing in their lot with everyone who isn&rsquo;t a white man.  Non-whites (even &#8220;white Hispanics&#8221;), backwards Muslims and especially gays are now further up the PC totem pole.  There have got to be quite a few white feminists who don&rsquo;t like that.  I enjoy having the vote and working part-time now that my kids are in school, but I have more in common with my hubby and blue collar male relatives than I do with any of this crowd.</p>
<p>Also, I laugh at the cognitive dissonance of demanding both an end to free trade AND support of open borders. Ha ha ha ha ha.</p>

		<p>So even though in the beginning, it was mostly white people and white males, they agreed to be marginalized.  I have to wonder how they imagine that the &#8220;movement&#8221; is going to work?  I still don&rsquo;t see any intelligent, cohesive message coming from it, but a mish-mash of generalized 60s styled slogans and pretensions. At least back then they knew what they were for and against.</p>
<p>What we know now is that it IS against white men. I think it is a matter of time before the white men figure out that they&rsquo;re being taken for a ride to nowhere and dumped off.  Remember, that these white guys are the most radical, self hating, brainwashed white males in America.</p>

		<p>These progressives are the most vile and discriminating bunch of loons that I&rsquo;ve seen in quite some time.  They group all white males together into one bunch and then dictate to everyone how enlightened they are.  When the final confrontation occurs, these guys will be in for a rude awakening.</p>
<p>Ordinary white men and more discriminated against than any other group in this country - bar none.<br>

<p>A perfect inserted quote for illustrating how idiotic this so-called Movement is.  Here&rsquo;s one who things that he is on the way to an apparently militant and violent revolution.  Quotes like this I hope will be understood by the white people involved.  The image I get is of a &#8220;Scareface&#8221; type mentality of the Mextizo, sitting in a former white owned mansion, drinking formerly white owned champagne, driving the formerly white owned Mercedes, drunk with booze, drugs, and power, bullying around his blonde wife/hostage.  Some revolutionary change.</p>
<p>Of course the state soon collapses into chaos because no one with the power will know how to run anything.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait until it snows.</p>

These &#8220;Alensky-ites&#8221; are striking while the iron is hot. Here in Alabama, illegal aliens protested against the new immigration law by not showing up for work and closing businesses. And our government protects them??? You can see the fabric unraveling daily&hellip;.</p>

		<p>It was this kind of behavior that transformed me from a race-denying, colorblind, White tool-of-the-left into a White nationalist, zealous for my race.</p>
<p>They openly acknowledge race, and at the same time embrace their own seething animosity toward Whites. You can just taste their hatred, jealousy, their envy. They want to control the beautiful things we make, and then destroy them and us. They want to dictate to Whites, now and forever, unconditionally.</p>
<p>Of course, to do the same to them is a heinous crime. We must be good little Whites and allow the non-Whites to replace Christ as our God.</p>
<p>I have utterly rejected this destiny for myself, and I encourage all Whites to open your eyes, see their hatred and longing for destruction of our race, and to reject it and embrace your own Whiteness.</p>

		<p>These aren&rsquo;t your grandfather&rsquo;s communists. These ones eat overpriced organic foods, possess fancy toys, and don&rsquo;t have to work. They acknowledge the natural hierarchy of man by their open and organized rejection of it, although it must be frustrating to these dopes that blacks and mestizos don&rsquo;t seem to feel the call to join.</p>
<p>It is a theory-to-practice exercise of what they were taught in school. And it isn&rsquo;t working out.</p>
<p>If the economy continues to go south, as it kind of has to at this point, history teaches us that the human biodiversity denialism religious wing of the OWS movement will be co-opted by the interests of the true working class. Watch for &lsquo;End the Fed&rsquo; signs. Heck, make one.</p>

		<p>I like one of the comments from the original blog article.<br>
&hellip;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool to think that racism and sexism are OK when we do them&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I suppose one day in the not too distant future, I&rsquo;m going to have to sit my now four year old son down and explain to him that he was born with a life debt due to his privileged working class back ground. And because of his lineage and station that he&rsquo;s going to be locked out of all future power talks and will have to take his place at the back of the queue to atone for the past sins of his demographic.</p>
<p>It seems that there are now two pathways to political power; the traditional establishment route and now the anti-establishment route, this White man was born on the outside of both of these pathways and it only looks like it, it&rsquo;s only going to get harder for &lsquo;my kind&rsquo; to break through from here. <br>
 <br>
Why do all of us White men, have to pay the price for the sins of these Wall Street &lsquo;White men&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the same sort of blanket discrimination that these progressives are meant to be against?</p>
<p>It means that the only sort of &lsquo;change&rsquo; that will occur; will be in the face of the oppressor.</p>
<p>I feel a lot less entitled (which is a privilege in itself), than apparently these protesters do. It appears that the last thing these egalitarians want is an even playing field, equal outcomes is all they want.</p>
<p>I agree with these protesters choice of target, but I suspect that their biggest fear would be to live in a world of truly equal opportunities, minus the helping hand of the government intervening with anti White discrimination. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;d be left naked, out in the open, with nowhere to hide and no one to blame but themselves. </p>
<p>This anti-establishment, anti-racist (etc), socialist calling for a redistribution of other&rsquo;s wealth is their best strategy, if not their only way of attaining power.<br>

<p>The White men in this movement are so weak that they will believe the liberal lie that they are privileged and deserve to come last in their own country. They are actually being told to sit in the back of the bus. Eventually, they will be made to stand in front of it and be run over.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately for proponents of the &#8220;progressive stack,&#8221; when the white man is not working, ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; workin&rsquo;.  Are these poo fighters unaware that jobs are scarce because the white, male elite who run this country are waiting out this Administration?

		<p>The &#8220;Occupy &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; movement is completely fraudulent. It is taking direct orders from Moveon.org wich is owned by&hellip;.Hedge fund Tycoon George Soros&hellip;that is to say, this movement is controlled by&hellip;Wall Street. Among the many demands of Occupy Wall Street is the demand to wipe away the borders of America to unrestricted nonwhite immigration&hellip;this of course is a gift to Wall Street. So Occupy Wall Street at the most fundamental level is promoting the interests of mega-powerful Corporations. The  activists involved in this movement are demanding that Native Born White Americans commit racial suicide within the borders of America&hellip;Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to do this.</p>
<p>Here is the larger point:racial minority status for Native Born White Americans means Native Born White Americans putting their fate in heavily armed, high fertility and very hostile nonwhite majority..in other words, decades of violent persecution.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your time defending yourself against the White Privilege charge..if you do, you are allowing these very creepy characters define the terms if the debate. Native Born White American racial interests completely define the terms of debate&hellip;the very creepy &#8220;moonie&#8221;-like Occupy Wall Street activists should not be the least bit shocked that Millions of Native Born White Americans are starting to revolt against race-replacement. If there borders of America were thrown completely open tomorrow, in a few weeks there would be a full-blown Native Born White American revolt against race-replacement..with 100 percent certainty it would happen.</p>
<p>This is how you respond to the very  creepy &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; activists. Read them the riot act.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hopefully The Occupied Wall Street Journal will abide by the zeitgeist of this movement, which is radical inclusivity.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
That&rsquo;s not radical inclusivity, it&rsquo;s radical Affirmative Action. It&rsquo;s radical discrimination against white males. It&rsquo;s the radical demotion to second-class-citizenship of a specific ethnic/gender group. It&rsquo;s a radical punishing of those progressives perceive as The Enemy. </p>

<p>  I&rsquo;m definitely of two minds regarding the OWS phenomenon. While I&rsquo;m all for making our masters as uncomfortable as is possible without ending up a statistic, I see in these crowds a lot of the types you&rsquo;d see camping out at Apple stores awaiting the chance to procure that company&rsquo;s latest geegaw. Students, coffee house anarchists, trust fund brats, &#8220;artists&#8221;,.etc. In other words, the enemy.</p>
<p>  The following goes against the advice I follow day-to-day, but if you&rsquo;re going to participate in these things, you&rsquo;d be better off in a mixed crowd.  If enough people are put off by events like those described in the article, they might start drifting into racially homogenous groups. And that would be handing one to the cops, who may be growing agitated and might relish a beat-down. And you know there&rsquo;s only one ethnicity you can pummel with impunity.</p>
<p>  If trouble starts, they&rsquo;ll go after Whitey (whytey?) first.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This is something that has been in place since the beginning, it is necessary, and it is important.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I believe this.  Until very recently, that is, before the Unions moved in and other racial special interest groups moved in, I saw majority whites, and several news spots where white men were shouting through bull horns.  If this was in place from the beginning it doesn&rsquo;t seem that one white man would be elected or allowed to speak for what is now claimed to be the majority of protesters.</p>
<p>The good news is that white males are being made to feel ostracized, undesirable to this movement.  White females will also tend to see themselves as considered too privileged as this thing goes on.  It might well be that the coming racial break-up of America will begin during or due to this movement&rsquo;s mechanizations.  </p>
<p>But this movement will fail due to lack of focus and credibility of leadership. Aside from the demand that the rich and powerful hand over their goods, I don&rsquo;t see any clear object excepting a general angst.  We all feel that, but for very different reasons. </p>

		<p>White men have been last for 50 years now if not always. There was even a song about it, I believe &#8216;The Last in Line&rsquo;. Since all white men earn more money than all women and persons of color, I guess that&rsquo;s the rationale their needs should be placed last if not ignored completely. At one time that was called &#8216;working&rsquo; and it was valued. </p>

<p> I would love to ask the moderators here why it takes so long to post comments on these articles. I have wondered this from the time I started posting here. After 6PM (pacific time) (I just came back on after 6 pm to ask this question), I am off the computer doing household chores, cooking etc. I have to wait until the next morning most of the time to see any comments.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a twisted journey through the pretzel logic of the progressive mind. It sounds like people at the NYC Indymedia are running the General Assembly. Apparently it&rsquo;s necessary to marginalize white men to have an inclusive revolution, because &#8220;If self-promoting egos get in the way, OWS will be sidelined.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like the convoluted construct &#8220;non-male identified.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The comedian Bill Burr once had a joke that went like this.</p>
<p>&#8216;My wife looked at me and said, &#8220;I read a study in the Wall Street Journal that said men make on average a dollar more per hour than women with equal qualifications. Do you think that&rsquo;s fair?&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;I said &#8220;Yes, honey, I do.&#8221; Then she asked me why, and I said, &#8220;Well honey that&rsquo;s because if we&rsquo;re on a boat and it&rsquo;s going down, for some reason you and the kids get to leave before me. That&rsquo;s what the extra dollar&rsquo;s for.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Give these feminists the equality they long for. Don&rsquo;t do any chivalrous, patronizing acts on their behalf. Hold no door open, even if their arms are full. Also, if the draft is ever reinstated, I want these women to have the same oppurtunity as men. Recruit them for all female infantry batallions.</p>

		<p>The lefty activists who gave lip service to unpacking white privilege from the 60s to the 90s were able to land sinecures from which they could berate their working class white lessers who couldn&rsquo;t protect themselves from blockbusting, busing, insourcing and outsourcing.  The well-meaning OWS whiteys, brainwashed by years of anti-white propaganda, won&rsquo;t be so lucky.  Black critical race theorists have grown increasingly strident, and when young YT realizes he isn&rsquo;t going to clean up like Tom Hayden, Michael Moore and Tim Wise did, he may get sick of Dr. Quaneesha Blackwomyn telling him to sit down and check his white privilege.</p>
<p>Berating white privilege is the privilege of those who can insulate themselves from the results of their meddling.  When the college bubble pops and the diversity training market dries up, a lot of SWPLs will find out that to the likes of Kevin Alvarez, they only exist to be tax farmed.</p>

		<p>Hopefully, when this country breaks off into 5 or 6 separate subdivisions along racial lines, those deadbeat whites who support &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; will be forced to live in a minority area. Enjoy your life without working infrastructure. After growing up in the &#8220;burbs&#8221;, going to college to study Comparative Literature and living off the system, it is going to be a shock to end up living in tribal encampments. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that it is (generally) white men who keep the wheels turning behind the scenes. <br>
 </p>
<p>&ldquo;Without the voices of the disenfranchised people of color, lgbtq, differently abled, and other marginalized groups then this will become a revolution of those with privilege against those with privilege. There is a difference between revolutionary change and just being allowed access to the power, status, and wealth of the dominant culture. And Occupy Wall Street should not be co-opted by those seeking a watered down version of this systematically murderous economic and political system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Go protest in the Middle East and see how long they tolerate your &#8220;diversity&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Someone wondered about the quality of the &#8216;white men&rsquo; who would join such a protest, I certainly wonder myself. However I have the sneaking suspicion that some of these &#8216;white men&rsquo; (apart from the homosexuals) that are willing to &#8216;stand back&rsquo; and bow their heads in shame are on a mission for some easy sex.

Instead we allow for it to be used against us to our destruction as too many whites tap dance about &#8216;color doesn&rsquo;t matter&rsquo;. Left unaddressed, that it will get worse and that whites will and are becoming marginalized is a given.

		<p>To follow up on my previous post, I can not overemphasize the highly fradulent character of the Occupy Wall Street movement and its well known supporters such as Noam Chomsky and Frances Fox Piven. If you spend anytime studying the labor history and economic history of the US, one thing really stands out dramatically and it is this:severe labor scarcities are the single most important factor in driving up the real wage and narrowing the extreme wealth gap between the Greedy Cheating Class of industrialists and millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans..and this holds true for the economic status of blacks. Severe labor scarcities have done way more to improve the lives of millions of Native Born White Americans-and even Blacks-than any goverment program. And severe labor scarcities only occur when there has been a massive reduction in the scale of legal immigration. By denying the Liberal Greedy Cheating Class access to foriegn scab labor, America became a much more economically and socially equal society. This is an absolutely well established fact in the economic literature&hellip;of course,ordinary Native Born White American workers understood this obvious fact way before the econometrcians got around to statisically establishing this fact.</p>
<p>And this brings me to the well known supporters of the Occupy Wall Street movement..specifically Noam Chomsky and Frances Fox Piven. For all their anti-corporate and pro-labor blatherings over the years, Noam Chomsky and Frances Fox  Piven are ultimately the best friends of the Wall Street Greedy Cheating Class, for by endorsing the Occupy Wall Street Crowd&rsquo;s demand for unlimited immigration of nonwhites to America, they deprive millions of Native Born White Americans the great benefit of a severe labor scarcity. This is an an immigation policy that-with one hundred percent certainty- will result in the massive tansfer of the wealth of milllions of Ordinary Native Born White Americans to Greedy Cheating Corporate Class..this is a great crime against millions of Native Born White Americans. </p>
<p>By the way, the fatal flaw of the immigration moratorium being pushed by Pat Buchannan in his new book is that it calls for increasing nonwhite immigration  once a severe labor scarcity is over-when unemployment drops below 6 percent..this is a blueprint for future and rapid race-replacement..shut all post-1965 immigration down to 0 permanently, and start the deportation of all the post-1965 nonwhite fifth columns which are quite large at the present time.</p>

		<p>I had a little hope for OWS when it started. Then I realized it was little more than the far left version of the Tea Party. Most of my friends are center left democrats and even they think it&rsquo;s ridiculous. If OWS wants to get a message out about corporate greed and financial abuse, I&rsquo;d be willing to listen. That&rsquo;s not what I see, though. The voice that seems to be screaming the loudest is that of unemployed recent college graduates with liberal arts degrees who are upset because they&rsquo;re not bombarded with offers for jobs that pay 100k a year. On top of that, you&rsquo;ve got this celebration of diversity that&rsquo;s peppered with anti-white bigotry. There&rsquo;s no reason for anyone who&rsquo;s sane to support OWS.</p>

		<p>Most older and conservative people are not taking these protests very seriously, but they should be.  We saw how radically the student protests of the 1960&rsquo;s changed America.  Today&rsquo;s youth are facing a far worse situation and have nothing else to do since even all the jobs at McDonald&rsquo;s have been taken by 40 year old immigrants.  I see these protests growing exponentially, lasting a long time and getting more militant as time goes on.  If the GOP wins back the white house, the entire left wing media will get behind the protesters and it will be glamorized to the point where hardly anyone under 30 will NOT be sympathetic.  </p>
<p>Young white males are not going to feel any less welcome in this movement than they are in the current establishment, mainstream society and in corporate America, which all have their own affirmative action policies.  You have to be nuts to think that a white 18 year old male who has had all the authority figures in society, including the military, professional sports, evangelical churches and GOP politicians tell him he is bad and needs to step aside his whole life is going to not join cute girls protesting because the protest leaders say the same things about him that the NFL, George W. Bush and the Army do.  </p>

Whether their friends believe this kind of idiocy, I really don&rsquo;t know&hellip;But it disturbs me to know there are fools out there who believe the same drivel. One thing that gives me hope is the fact that there were only 7 comments to the brain dead authoress&rsquo;s &#8220;work&#8221;, and they mostly dealt with the supposed gender of of one of the protesters&hellip;  My God.

<p>Of course. Just do a Google search. The OWS activists have already released their dozen or so demands..and one of them is unrestricted nonwhite legal immigration..and they specifically give what is a Corporate Greedy Cheating Class justification for it:  specifically, they state that that the more labor that floods into the US, the better..the obvious implication being that a  labor scarcity would be a terrible thing..in other words, they are making an economic justification for race-replacing the Native Born White American Majority with hostile,high fertility nonwhites&hellip;this is pure unadulterated corporatism.</p>
<p>George Soros gave the initial 5 million that set into motion Moveon.org. Moveon.org&rsquo;s two founders started the organization to defend the rapist, war criminal-bombing of the innocent Serbian population-race-replacement enthusiast and big time whore for the Corporations and Wall Street, Bill Clinton. These two founders of Moveon are computer company executives. So it is beyond obvious that Moveon.org represents the financial interests of the Liberal White Greedy Cheating Class..the very group the OWS is supposedly protesting against.</p>
<p>As far Noam Chomsky goes, he is a big time fraud..and liar. Specifically, in the past several years when he has written about the evil corporations and evil Wall Street, he used quotes from Alan Greenspan&rsquo;s late 90s testimony before Congress on how to revive the US economy. Noam Chomsky quotes the vicious anti-labor sentiment contained in Alan Greenspan&rsquo;s Congressional testimony&hellip;but not all of it..and the part Chomsky quotes stops directly before the first sentence to the paragraph where Alan Greenspan specifically calls for a massive increase in legal immigration for the purpose of creating massive downward pressure on wages. Without a doubt this is not an oversight by Noam Chomsky..I can count a dozen times where Noam Chomsky has stopped the Alan Greenspan quote just before Greenspan calls for a massive increase in legal immigrant scab labor.  I mean it is really despicable isn&rsquo;t it? There can be no doubt that Noam Chomsky is an enthusiastic supporter of OWS call for wiping away the US border..which would be a great gift to the Greedy Cheating Class that they are supposedly fighting against. If only Pat Buchanan had put this in his new book, it would be a number one best seller for the next three years.</p>
<p>George Soros has recently announced his support for OWS. It is all one big con job.</p>

I have the privilege of paying cash or using my debit card to buy groceries while the lady with $500 worth of groceries pay with her EBT card. I have had the privilege to be wrongly accused of racism which put my job in jeopardy. I have had the privlege to be told I would not be considered for a job because I was the wrong, race, sex, and religion! I have had the privilege to tell my wife we can not have another child because we cannot afford the costs, meanwhile a mother of six children in Clayton County GA complains to the media that she can&rsquo;t feed her kids because her EBT card only has 17 cents! I feel so privleged! </p>

		<p>Personally, I tend to favor big business but Whites don&rsquo;t really have a bone to pick in this fight (protest). If &#8216;wall street&rsquo; needs reformed, those who are pro-white should be all for it. Perhaps these &#8216;liberal&rsquo; excesses do nothing but help the cause of these &#8216;fat-cat&rsquo; bankers? </p>

		<p>The Occupy Wall Street protests as other posters correctly noted are fraudulent, with funding from George Soros, whose personal wealth is some 22 billion dollars. He is no friend of anyone who has white, European heritage, indeed he has helped wreck the economies of four nations, ours included. The protesters are merely dupes, they are first of all identifying themselves to both the ruling elite and white Americans as enemies to be eliminated or imprisoned. They are also going to start violent riots the ruling elite will use as a pretext to impose martial law. We all know what the military and police will do next, round up and disarm white Americans while allowing the violent and heavily armed non-white hordes to rape, and kill us. Much of the military is non-white and not even American to begin with, and they will follow orders to attack the native white population without question. If things come to this, whites better take a page from my Slavic ancestors&rsquo; play book, and that is to never forgive, forget nor show any mercy when whites counter attack. </p>

		<p>These Wall Street Occupiers strike me as intelligent young people who have always been the best of their class, and now, in the real, working world, resent that the fact that they are expected to start near the bottom like everyone else.  What they don&rsquo;t seem to realize is that, once they get started, they will become the leaders they want to be, as long as they do not ruin their chances by stunts like this.</p>

		<p>I admit some passing interest in the Occupy Wall Street protests because I do think the financial industry is in for some serious criticism for their role in the most recent recession. Reform is needed. Sadly, it&rsquo;s pretty clear that even with a President like Obama who leans so far to the left on social issues, when it comes to economic policy, he&rsquo;s been bought and paid for by big business many times over.</p>
<p>That being said, the &#8220;OWS movement&#8221; or whatever you want to call it won&rsquo;t be getting my support.</p>
<p>A lot of people who are sympathetic to what the aims of the movement appear to be are going to find out the hard way that the movement is quickly being co-opted and indeed &#8220;occupied&#8221; by the usual left wing crackpots that repel average Americans.</p>
<p>If the movement had any promise in the beginning, it was that it was more of a spontaneous gathering of people who aren&rsquo;t usually activist types. I get the impression that a lot of &#8220;normal&#8221; people are still making the trek to find out what&rsquo;s going on, but they are in for an education about who inhabits the typical left-wing activist &#8220;ghetto.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lifelong socialist and communist &#8220;activists&#8221; who are basically mentally disturbed types. It&rsquo;s anti-white hate groups like the Uhuru Movement. It&rsquo;s the anarchist punk kids in their unwashed glory. It&rsquo;s minority public employee labor union types. It&rsquo;s the white, latino, black, south asian, etc. girls from the local expensive universities who are looking for every opportunity to get in the face of any white male they can find and yell and scream and go blue in the face repeating their &#8220;privilege&#8221; mantras (some of these girls will go on to become professors). </p>
<p>Nope. The OWS movement isn&rsquo;t a populist movement for the rest of us. When people get a taste of the true far left, they find it pretty unpleasant.</p>

		<p>I just read all the comments about the protests. However the comments about these protestors bear little resemblance to the ones I met. The ones I talked to were overwhelmingly White and had come to the conclusion that the system itself has to be changed. I met veterans, mechanics, school teachers etc. What do I care if some self-appointed do glider writes some idiot column.most of the people I talked to agreed that ALL immigration should be stop pep. Legal and illegal. So far so good. So what if some of the people are PC. I have news for you. Blacks and Latinos did not sign the 1965 immigration bill. They do not refuse to guard the border. They do not start wars all over world, bankrupting all of us. They are the powers that be doing it. With Wall Street and their media allies leading the way. Until those people are removed forcibly or not forget about the change we want. You think the Tea Party is going to do that? Forget it, I went to a rally at least half were on Medicare and the other Balfour were fully vested in the system one way or another. <br>
WN of all stripes have to realize if we can remove the string pullers things will be very easy to change after that. Now that I see the comments above I have been shocked into reality, possibly. All I see is Rush Limbaughism that does not like minorities. Well if that is a fair statement by me, then it is me who is out of step here. So just like in did with VDare I may have to take myself and my checkbook out of here. I have seen others with my mindset for years on this site however the comments that are ALL in same vane on this topic both disappoint and sadden me. If you think you are going to get change with the current batch of race traitors and their alien allies in control, not going to happen.</p>

		<p>I have one objection and one objection only (and I&rsquo;m depressed that no one else here has voiced it yet) to these demonstrations, and that&rsquo;s that it&rsquo;s sadly the usual suspects, <b>rather than people like ourselves who should be taking the lead</b>, who are out there protesting these stinking, predatory, piratical financial institutions that by dint of being the largest campaign contributors to our national politicians have been allowed to loot us, loot us, and then loot us again!!!</p>
<p>I recently received notice from Citibank that I will be charged $15 a month now just for the privilege of keeping my checking account with them! For this we bailed them out?</p>
<p>I commend the left for doing what we should be doing. I realize it&rsquo;s more complicated than that, but that&rsquo;s the bottom line. I don&rsquo;t care about all the left&rsquo;s internal silliness, but I hate these stinking banks and the stinking corrupted politicians that have allowed the banks to take trillions of dollars from us. And you should hate them too! Do you imagine the people who run these institutions are of us? Even the banksters who are of our race are not of us, for they are traitors to our race and destroyers of our race!</p>

		<p>&#8221; I have the sneaking suspicion that some of these &lsquo;white men&rsquo; (apart from the homosexuals) that are willing to &lsquo;stand back&rsquo; and bow their heads in shame are on a mission for some easy sex. I&rsquo;ve witnessed similar behaviour way back when I was at college.&#8221;</p>
<p>Very true. Those early sixties freedom rides to bring enlightenment to the neanderthal White southerners were the easiest way for the nerd losers to get some.</p>
<p>A few years later, every construction worker and mechanic in the San Francisco bay area bought a shoulderlength wig and some second hand clothes to go to the hippie enclaves of San Francisco<br>
to get some on the wekends.</p>
<p>Nowdays, the college guys who can&rsquo;t get any take a womyn&rsquo;s study course to get some.</p>
<p>Whoever posted something about Move on and Soros is dead right. </p>
<p> Soros was also responsible for those spring of 2006 illegal immigant mass marches in so many cities.  He is behind all these arab spring revolutions that have brought anarchy and even more discrimination against Christians and islamic and ethnic minorities in the middle east.</p>
<p>Soros was also messing around in Ukraine and other former soviet nations a few years ago.</p>
<p>Soros is probably planning to do to the federal reserve what he did to the Bank of England.  He earned more than 1 billion pounds 1 1/2 billion dollars in one day while almost bankrupting the Bank Of England.  He probably hopes to do something worse than that,like when he manipulated currency in the 1990&rsquo;s to cause the Asian meltdown.</p>
<p>Soros is a good example of why the immigration laws of 1925 should never, never have been overturned.  He would still be an international criminal, but at least he would not be an American citizen.</p>

		<p>This is bizarre. I didn&rsquo;t get to see the sixties, but this is like an even more radical version of it to me. I think of this as similar to the gap between WW1 and WW2. The first war hadn&rsquo;t truly resolved many of the problems that caused it so it set the stage for WW2. </p>
<p>The sixties obviously hadn&rsquo;t come to their full effect when they ended and so have set the stage for this echo. Hopefully there will be a final backlash against this sixties revisited. A new counterculture to counter the old one.</p>

		<p>The occupy wall street has all the signs of a standard communist operation.  It is based on Cloward Priven and the Bill Ayers Chicago riots of 1968.  Here is a good summary of who and what is behind the occupy wall street operation.</p>
<p>Those who think Whites will be saved by Russians should note the part played by Russia today.</p>
<p>Kincaid: A Marxist Takeover of D.C.&rsquo;s Freedom Plaza<br>
GOPUSA ^ | October 14, 2011 | Cliff Kincaid </p>
<p><br>
The &ldquo;October 2011&rdquo; movement organizer Dennis Trainor tells me that he believes capitalism is &ldquo;homicidal&rdquo; and that the U.S. needs a revolution. &ldquo;This is not a reform movement,&rdquo; he said. He is part of the illegal occupation of Freedom Plaza in Washington, D.C. The &ldquo;October 2011&rdquo; movement is not part of, but endorses the &ldquo;Occupy Wall Street&rdquo; movement that began several weeks ago. <br>
Although he describes himself as new to professional agitation, Trainor runs the &ldquo;No Cure For That&rdquo; website and served as a writer/media consultant for Dennis Kucinich&rsquo;s 2008 presidential campaign. Kucinich is the Cleveland Democrat perhaps best known for proposing a &ldquo;Department of Peace&rdquo; for the U.S. Government. </p>
<p>Trainor was calm during my interview. But he was yelling and screaming &ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; during one of his early speeches to the crowd at Freedom Plaza, which is U.S. National Park Service property. &ldquo;I am here until it is done,&rdquo; he proclaimed. He has produced a video insisting that President Obama, like Libya&rsquo;s deposed ruler Moammar Gaddafi, is &ldquo;unfit to lead&rdquo; and &ldquo;disconnected from reality.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Perhaps Obama should rethink his praise of these protesters. Or perhaps the President&rsquo;s plan is to use them for his own purposes. </p>
<p>The protesters have made a mess of Freedom Plaza and their tents make it almost impossible for tourists and families to enjoy the area of inlaid stone that is usually used for festivals and other civic gatherings. It is against the law for protesters in this area to erect tents, live there and prepare food. </p>
<p>The law states, &ldquo;Temporary structures may not be used outside designated camping areas for living accommodation activities such as sleeping, or making preparations to sleep (including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping), or storing personal belongings, or making any fire, or doing any digging or earth breaking or carrying on cooking activities.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Trainor admits in my video that the tents &ldquo;are not permitted.&rdquo; But they have not been removed. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, in violation of the law, Trainor says the U.S. National Park Service has given them a permit to remain there for the next four months. </p>
<p>Trainor told me that the anti-Wall Street protesters believe they will bring down the government and create a new system based on higher taxes for the rich, free health care for all, an end to wars, etc. It is tempting to laugh at them, except for the fact that veterans of the 1960s protests as well as Soros-funded groups like Think Progress are putting their weight behind these determined Marxists, misfits and crazies. </p>
<p>Pat Garofalo, Economic Policy Editor for ThinkProgress.org at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, has appeared on the Vladimir Putin-funded Thom Hartmann Russia Today propaganda program, as well as on foreign-funded Al-Jazeera. Garofalo is defending the protests against charges that demonstrators are freaks. The &ldquo;Occupy Wall Street&rdquo; protest that began in New York City &ldquo;has sparked an entire movement, based on the principle that the economy should work for everyone, not simply the richest one percent,&rdquo; he gushes. </p>
<p>It is significant that the protests have support from a Moscow-funded channel eager to depict America as a capitalist economy under siege by its own citizens. The protests make for good global anti-American propaganda. </p>
<p>You may recall that Hartmann, another mouthpiece for the protesters, is the progressive media star who grabbed my camera in disgust when I questioned him about how much money he was getting paid by Moscow. </p>
<p>While Hartmann made a fool of himself, the so-called mainstream media in the U.S. are more sophisticated and not so blatant or stupid about revealing their own agenda of making these protests into something they&rsquo;re not. Simple research reveals that the protest movement is anything but a spontaneous uprising. </p>
<p>The organizers are long-time activists from the far-left fringes. The Freedom Plaza encampment, with about two dozen tents, has one devoted to media and another concerned with legal help. The old communist-front National Lawyers Guild is supplying the lawyers. </p>
<p>Trainor told me he is a married father of two kids involved in &ldquo;new media,&rdquo; that he came down from Massachusetts and is doing a documentary about the protests. He was candid enough to admit that more &ldquo;seasoned&rdquo; activists are really in charge. </p>
<p>One name that surfaces in connection with the October 2011 movement is Devra Morice, a member of the &ldquo;organizing committee&rdquo; for the Movement for a Democratic Society. If you think the name of this group sounds strikingly like the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) from the 1960s, you would be correct. The Movement for a Democratic Society is the grouping of SDS veterans like Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn who are trying to organize another SDS on the college campuses. Ayers and Dohrn, of course, went on to become communist terrorists who bombed U.S. government buildings and police stations. </p>
<p>In October 2008, Morice signed a letter &ldquo;to support our colleague Professor William Ayers, Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who is currently under determined and sustained political attack&hellip;We, the undersigned, stand on the side of education as an enterprise devoted to human inquiry, enlightenment, and liberation. We oppose the demonization of Professor William Ayers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Another name from the past involved in organizing the October 2011 movement is Ellen Davidson, whose &ldquo;30-plus years of activism&rdquo; includes working with Covert Action Information Bulletin. This is the old anti-CIA publication associated with CIA defector Philip Agee, who became a paid agent of Cuba and died in Havana. </p>
<p>The website of the October 2011 group is quite helpful in determining who is really behind the protests. Financial contributions go to something called the &ldquo;Alliance for Global Justice,&rdquo; located at 1247 E Street SE in Washington, D.C. This has been a headquarters for all kinds of leftist groups in the nation&rsquo;s capital for years. These have included Code Pink, the Nicaragua Network, the Venezuela Solidarity Network, and ANSWER &mdash; the Act Now to Stop War and End Racism group. The website of October 2011 specifically asks that supplies be sent to Code Pink at the above address. </p>
<p>Code Pink is, of course, the hard-left organization that includes luminaries such as Medea Benjamin and Jodie Evans, a fundraiser for Obama. When they are not protesting U.S. foreign policy, they are working to undermine Israel. </p>
<p>The Venezuela Solidarity Network, organized to provide support for Marxist Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, has a &ldquo;steering committee&rdquo; that includes the U.S. Peace Council, the old Communist Party USA front. </p>
<p>In other words, we are dealing with front groups on top of front groups. It is classic deception and propaganda, designed to rope in the unsuspecting. This is a Marxist movement that is promising confrontation. </p>
<p>Those who think that international communism died with the collapse of the old Soviet Union should take a hard look at who is behind these protests. For the most part, we have the same old names and the same old faces. The younger ones are mostly dupes. </p>
<p>Meantime, ordinary Americans are starting to have their fill and are demanding that the police clear out the protesters. </p>
<p>In Boston, where police officers reported being spit on by some protesters, Police Superintendent William Evans gave the &ldquo;Occupy Boston&rdquo; crowd two minutes to disperse from a public park and began arresting them when they did not comply. The police noted that the demonstrators had created public safety hazards and engaged in disorderly conduct. </p>
<p>In D.C., they have disrupted the National Air and Space Museum and the Hart Senate Office Building. One of the protesters that was arrested and hauled away by police was the aforementioned Dennis Trainor. However, he was quickly back to Freedom Plaza in the special media tent. </p>
<p>Despite the four-month deal with the Park Police to remain at Freedom Plaza, the demonstrators have announced, &ldquo;Freedom Plaza Is Now Ours. And we&rsquo;re never giving it back.&rdquo; </p>
<p>A posting on their website says, &ldquo;We have not said that when the four months are over and the American Spring is here we will leave. In fact, we intend to make it possible for anyone to visit D.C. with free accommodations. Just bring a sleeping bag and agree to work with us to pressure Congress, the White House, K Street, the Pentagon, and all the lobbyists and profiteers for peace and justice. We have free food, we have free drink, we have free trainings and seminars, we have tents, we have peace keepers, we have a big victory under our belts, and we welcome all peace makers for they shall inherit Freedom Plaza. We own it. It is ours. It shall remain ours world without end.&rdquo; </p>
<p>It is apparent that the U.S. National Park Service officials, who answer to federal authorities, including Obama, have made a calculated decision to let these protests build in Washington, D.C. They have been given special rights over the rights of ordinary law-abiding citizens to enjoy their national parks and monuments.</p>

		<p>It was soon obvious to me that Occupy Wall Street was just another generic lefty protest, so the white male bashing is to be expected.  The whole project is notably inarticulate and misses most of the real targets.</p>
<p>The current financial crisis has many causes and most of the culprits aren&rsquo;t even on Wall Street.  Among them:</p>
<p>1.  After the NASDAQ crash, Y2K worries, and 9/11 the Fed decided to keep interest rates very low.  That encouraged rampant speculation in housing, as low interest means low payments so people think they can afford a more expensive house.</p>
<p>2.  The government created the so-called Government Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  These GSE&rsquo;s lowered their lending standards and bought up most of the subprime mortgages issued by banks like Countrywide.  In the early 2000s some Republicans tried to tighten up those lending standards.  They were opposed by the Democrats, some of whom accused the Republicans of being &#8220;racist&#8221;.  (The head of Fannie Mae was a black man at the time.)  Thanks to the politicians the taxpayers are now on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars of dud mortgages.</p>
<p>3.  The government also created the Community Reinvestment Act, which forced banks to give loans to people they knew would probably not pay them back.  This played a minor role in the crisis but it did add some fuel to the fire.  ACORN sued Citibank in 1994 to force them to make loans to impecunious blacks.  One of their lawyers was Barrack Obama.</p>
<p>4.  Millions of Americans bought houses they should have known they couldn&rsquo;t afford.  Some of them later blamed the mortgage brokers for telling them they could afford a loan when they couldn&rsquo;t.  But if you are enough of a grown up to buy a house you are supposed to know how to add and subtract, and figure out your budget.  You should be able to determine if you can really make the payments on a house without consulting with a banker.  (This is not to exonerate those mortgage brokers who made outright misrepresentations of the loans they issued, and there was certainly a fair amount of that going on too.)  No small number of Americans bought expensive houses with loans that had low initial &#8220;teaser&#8221; payments.  They knew they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to afford the higher payments when they kicked in but assumed they would be able to flip the house to a bigger fool before that happened.  They found out they were the biggest fool.</p>
<p>5.  Finally, there were some &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; bankers who securitized the mortgages, magically transforming sub prime mortgages into AAA bonds.  They knew, or should have known, that they were committing fraud.  So yes, some bankers should have gone to jail, but didn&rsquo;t.  Some of the heads of AIG should also have gone to jail, for insurance fraud, but didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But most of the people on Wall Street had nothing to do with causing the financial crisis.  Brokers in stocks and corporate or municipal bonds had nothing to do with it.  Neither did traders in stocks, options, futures, or forex.  Neither did option market makers or stock specialists.  Some of those guys made money in the crisis, and some lost their shirts, but none of them caused the crisis.  But because many are rich and work in the financial district, they are targeted by OWS.</p>
<p>Today of course there are many innocent victims of the crash, including people who prudently bought a house they could afford at the time but have now lost their job, or have a house that is now underwater because of the general decline in the housing market.  But no progress will be made if we keep blaming the wrong people, and keep reelecting the guilty.<br>

		<p>#68 your response to my post misses my point. I am not saying every last person at these rallies are my favorites. I am saying they have the right target. I also met many Whites who have nothing to lose, those are the people who will change things but I also must say that in the end WN might have to do a lot worse things than defecate on cop cars. That is nothing compared to what may be coming. Did you know there is a law in New York that allows these corporations to pay the cops directly do defend them. Sad but true, New York cops are not who you think they are.<br>
I am no National Socialist, but did you know by 1930 half of all SA members were former Communists. They were welcomed with open arms.We need Whites who are activists. I do not care about their past. If they are with us now or in the future, I welcome them as my brother. As they are!</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t call that the <i>crucial</i> element, but, yeah, that should be added to the list.  George W. Bush was as bad as the Democrats on that issue.  George W. Bush has reached the unique distinction of being hated by both the right and the left, for equally good reasons   &mdash;   he combined idiotic leftist domestic policies with idiotic &#8220;conservative&#8221; war policies.  I put &#8220;conservative&#8221; in quotes, because war is a radical and almost always imprudent policy, always leading to the growth of the state, so there is nothing conservative about it.<br>

		<p>No where have I ever said that down payments weren&rsquo;t important.  I have argued in previous posts that banks should require a minimum down payment of 20%, and that for older people (like me) it should be higher (40% or more) since we&rsquo;re not going to live as long.  The EZ loan terms that banks made, including no down payment loans, were obviously a big part of the problem.  But banks would never have made such crazy loans if they couldn&rsquo;t offload them to somebody else (so their profits come from the up front fees, not from sitting back and collecting 30 years of payments).  The GSEs and Wall Street mortgage securitization were the two major vehicles by which banks with bad lending practices could get rid of their dud loans.  Also, it&rsquo;s not as though George W. Bush was the primary reason banks came up with no down payment loans.  It was because they knew some other sucker was going to be holding the loans.</p>

<p>These protesters have a sense of entitlement. They think they&rsquo;re owed a life of comfort and that whatever they can&rsquo;t afford should be paid for by the American taxpayer. They believe they have a &ldquo;right&rdquo; to anything they want without having to work for it.￼</p>

<p>What is their idea of &#8216;peace and justice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Big Brother solutions.</p>
<p>The protesters are calling for a revolution to change the foundation of our economic system. They want more government regulations, more petty laws and &ldquo;the rich&rdquo; taken down.  They blame capitalism and business people for their problems.</p>
<p>Eventually, these types of mobs react violently if they don&rsquo;t get their way, which is already happening.  Protesters have rushed and spit on police officers, stormed office buildings and defecated on police cars.  As the violence grows, anyone who possess anything they covet will become a target.  The police may not be able to contain them.</p>

		<p>76 Bon:</p>
<p>Okay, but you better drink some coffee, this is going to be boring.  Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t warn you.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll fit my longer explanation around my two bullet points above:</p>
<p>First, &#8220;restrictor plate racing.&#8221;  You have to be a NASCAR fan to know what that means, and its metaphorical application to the economics of residential real estate.  A mandate for a typical purchaser to have a certain percentage as a down payment acts as a &#8220;restrictor&#8221; or a brake on how high the price of real estate can go.  If you have to have 20% down, or in fact, any percentage down, as long as it&rsquo;s not an insignificantly small percentage, there&rsquo;s only so much that houses can sell for, ESPECIALLY &#8220;starter homes,&#8221; because there&rsquo;s only so much money the typical first time home buyer can save in cash or other securities easily convertible to cash.  (It is assumed that people buying second, third, fourth, etc. homes will have enough equity in their previous home to have the 20%.)  </p>
<p>That down payments requirements were pretty much eliminated during the last decade disconnected any economic link between the ability of the average first time buyer to save money or securities and the prices of &#8220;typical&#8221; houses.  Therefore, this price governor was gone, and predictably, prices went up because they could.  Compounding this was ignoring &#8220;percentage of gross income&#8221; standards for computing how much a month you could pay for your mortgage (at one point, it was assumed that people would have the ability to devote more than their entire after-tax income for the mortgage), and bankers doing &#8220;affordability&#8221; calculations based on the intro/teaser interest rates.  Add this to the mix, and it&rsquo;s a perfect recipe for soaring real estate prices.  In environmentally sensitive places, where a new housing supply was practically impossible, the soaring prices soared even faster.</p>
<p>I understand that relatively small houses in the San Fernando Valley could have been bought and sold for as much as $700,000 at one point.  What native born white American working class household can afford the mortgage note on a 700K starter house?  The only reason they were ever &#8220;worth&#8221; that much is because of the unsustainable economics of the subprime mortgage mania.  People are now whining about how their houses aren&rsquo;t worth what they&rsquo;re used to be, and blaming Obama.  I blame Obama for a lot, but this isn&rsquo;t his fault.  The only reason their houses were ever &#8220;worth&#8221; that much is because of banking and financial voodoo.  Most loans are calculated based on what your payment is based on what you&rsquo;re borrowing, the interest rate and the number of months   &mdash;   Mortgages often work in reverse   &mdash;   The bankers figure out how much monthly payment you can afford first (that&rsquo;s where the screw ups happened, see above), then worked backwards with the months (usu. 360) and interest rate to come up with the dollar value of house you can afford, and you were pre-approved for that amount.  Well, with more and more people getting pre-approved for more and more ridiculously high amounts (the Hispanic cherry picker claiming $14K income, though not proven, getting a $720K pre-approval), all bidding against each other for the same sardine box houses in Burbank, Calif., Summerlin, Nev., Peoria, Ariz., et al., it&rsquo;s obvious to see where the prices will go.</p>
<p>Another problem was that existing owners, seeing the fake &#8220;values&#8221; of their sardine boxes go &#8220;up&#8221; for this voodoo reason, got banks to &#8220;cash out refi&#8221; their houses, sometimes multiple times in multiple years.  The sardine box you bought in the Valley for $100G a long time ago was said all of sudden said to be worth $700G because some Hispanic cherry picker got pre-approved for a $700G mortgage.  Well, you want to live in your house still, but all of a sudden you have $600G more &#8220;value&#8221; in your house.  Therefore, you buy the house from yourself and the bank which holds the deed in case you still owe on it, in this climate of no standards and no documentation.  You have a bigger and unsustainable mortgage note, but you also have a huge wad of cash to go to Hawaii, haul posterior down to Wal*Martinez and fill up your shopping carts with all that China-made junk at everyday low wages guaranteed, pay for your 18-year old rugrats to go to Overpriced Social Justice University at $60,000 a year, etc.  And, the proceeds from cash-out refis aren&rsquo;t subject to capital gains taxes, because you&rsquo;re not selling the house to anyone else, you&rsquo;re just refinancing, technically speaking.  You have that money now, the new note you can&rsquo;t afford?  Just cross that bridge when you get there, after all, your house will be worth a cool million by that time, unless it won&rsquo;t, and as it turns out, it didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This was unsustainable because people need to eat.  You can&rsquo;t devote 102% of your after tax income to mortgage payments forever, in fact, you can&rsquo;t even do it for one payment cycle.  Notes get missed, banks foreclose, can&rsquo;t make any more voodoo mortgages b/c of how badly the first round failed, can&rsquo;t sell the houses for anything close to the initial mortgage amount.  Collapse.</p>
<p>Banks (recently merged with investment houses, thanks to the repeal of Glass-Stegall, thank you Bill Clinton plus GOP Congress), conned each other to buy and sell the receivables of these phony mortgages based on even more phony financial instruments, looking to offload what they all knew were bad accounts receivable.</p>
<p>Second, &#8220;Skin in the Game.&#8221;  If you had to pony up 20% down, this means you started the mortgage loan with 20% equity in the house.  If you didn&rsquo;t make your first payment, you instantly lost your 20% equity.  This was your incentive to make the mortgage payments, as long as you had the ability to do so.  On the flip side of the ledger, it was a quasi insurance policy for the bank - Because they only loaned 80% of the selling price, if the borrower didn&rsquo;t make as much as one payment, they could break even if they sold the foreclosed property for 80% of what it just sold for a month earlier, and, even in times of fast declining real estate values (for whatever reason), that was pretty much a guarantee.  Usually, the bank could sell for more than 80% of the previous selling price, means the bank comes out ahead.</p>
<p>With Bush&rsquo;s wonderful &#8220;no down payment it hurts blacks and Hispanics&#8221; paradigm, all these subprime borrowers went into the mortgage having no equity, and no skin in the game.  Even though they couldn&rsquo;t really make the payments (see above), they didn&rsquo;t have anything to lose even if they could make them.  On the flip side of the ledger, the banks had no insurance, so when they had to foreclose, they had to sell the house for the same price it just sold for, in order to break even.  And, with the predictable collapse of the affirmative action mortgage market, and the predictable crash in housing values, breaking even was a practical impossibility.  This means big losses for the banks, and big losses for whoever was holding these mortgages&rsquo; A/Rs down the line, having been bought and sold 15 times since the mortgage was drawn, usually an investment house or an insurance company (e.g. AIG).  </p>
<p>Blame?  I halfway blame government, and halfway blame the &#8220;private&#8221; (insert laugh tracks here) banking and financial industry.  The government for forcing affirmative action down the throats of the real estate finance industry, and the relevant private industry for not putting up one iota of resistance - They could have if they wanted, because they have bought off enough politicians of both parties.  As far as government, I blame left wing Democrats and lamestream conservative Republicans about as equally, the left wing Democrats for the racial paradigm and also the foundation of the legislative mechanisms (CRA, etc.), and the lamer cons like Bush for pulling the crucial trigger (&#8220;down payments are discriminatory&#8221;) based on lamestream conservative racial ideology, i.e. blacks and Hispanics misbehave because they don&rsquo;t &#8220;own&#8221; their residential domiciles.  Too, Bush, Roverrated, Kemp, et al. though that home ownership would turn blacks and Hispanics into Republicans, because of their short sighted faulty causational analysis of the partisan trends of people who had already &#8220;owned&#8221; their houses.  As Sailer said this weekend, it&rsquo;s not that home owners vote Republican, it&rsquo;s that white people who were credit worthy for mortgages and made their payments voted Republican.</p>
<p>Yeah, the financial system can survive bad &#8220;no down payment&#8221; loans on sofas and big screen TVs, but it is hurt badly when the same applied to houses goes awry.</p>
<p>In November 1999, the first issue of the Citizens Informer newspaper, the CofCC publication, under the editorship of Sam Francis, had a front page headline article entitled &#8220;Glass-Stegall RIP.&#8221;  It predicted a good chunk of what came to happen, though it fell short of how bad it actually was, mainly because neither Sam nor Chris Temple (the article&rsquo;s author) could forsee a lamer con President demanding no down payment mortgages.  Sam got a lot of heat from us people who wanted &#8220;all race all the time&#8221; articles in the Informer.  Turns out it was a racial issue in a round about way in the long run.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not keying in this treatise again.  Save it as a text file for future reference if you think you&rsquo;ll need it again, or bookmark the URL of this AR story.  I&rsquo;ve been to business school once already, and once was quite enough.</p>

		<p>I think you SHOULD explain why down payments on mortgages are crucial.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  BON</p>
<p>I also think this is an overlooked issue that needs further explanation.</p>
<p>I remember sensing disaster when Bush II hypocritically declared war on the need for down payments:  &#8220;The single biggest barrier to home-ownership is accumulating funds for a down payment.:&#8221;</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century 20% down on a house was the standard lending practice.  One huge advantage of the down payment is to lower the total price of the home, so the principal of the loan amount is greatly reduced. As a result, a great deal less interest is paid over the course of the loan and the monthly payment is also much lower.</p>
<p>A $100,000 home may be financed with a fixed rate mortgage of 4.5% over 30 years. Without a downpayment, the average monthly payment will be $506.69 and over the course of 30 years, $82,406 will be paid as interest. If, on the other hand, you paid a 10% down payment of $10,000, the average monthly payment will be $456.02 and the total interest paid will be 74,166.</p>
<p>Borrowers who have been able to save the funds for a down payment are less likely to get into payment troubles later on. Saving for a down payment requires budgetary discipline, repaying a mortgage also requires budgetary discipline. Of course, this assumes that the down payment is saved, not borrowed. Underwriters look for evidence that the funds committed to down payment are the borrower&rsquo;s own.  They know free down payments carry catastrophic risks. </p>

<p>Thank you for your explanation about the mortgage fiasco.  You put it all together.  I printed it and copied it on my hard drive.</p>
<p>I remember about 15 years ago all the hispanic security guards where I work were buying $500,000 dollar homes.  They made 8 to 10 dollars an hour.  Wives were maids and nurses aides. If both worked full time all year it was about $20,000 take home.</p>
<p>No down payment on $500,000 homes for a couple taking home about $20,000.  No factoring in property taxes or utilities or necessary maintanance on those built to fall apart in 20 years California houses built by illegal immigrants and legal immigrant contractors who had no idea what they were doing.</p>
<p>I think property taxes had a lot to do with it.  Counties and cities bear huge burdens in caring for illegals.  So if the prices of houses are artifically jacked up, the property taxes will go up.</p>
<p>Of course collecting $12,000 per year property taxes from a couple bringing home $20,000 per year is another story.</p>

<p>And yes, with &#8220;Skin in the Game&#8221;, as in equity, one is much more vested in his home   &mdash;    has a lot more to lose than one of the government&rsquo;s favored people who were gifted with no downpayment/no interest mortgages (which they little understood) from which they were able to walk away after they&rsquo;d had their fun. </p>
<p>There was a lot of this in California, given the high price of real estate here!</p>

		<p>A couple of addenda to my treatise:</p>
<p>1.  &#8220;Okay, QD, then why did all these banks, financial institutions, investment houses, etc. knowingly create, buy and sell A/Rs from subprime mortgages and CDOs and other subprime mortgage based financial instruments and securities, knowing that they were bad?&#8221;  The fundamental answer, I alluded to above:  Everyone thought housing would go up forever.  Nobody cared about the typical subprime borrower&rsquo;s obvious inability to pay because they thought the house would be worth more once foreclosure time happened.  To 81 Anonymous above:  If the people who ran the governments who had property taxation authority over these houses thought it through, they were not bothered by the inability of the Hispanic household pulling in $20K/yr to pay the PPT on their &#8220;$500G&#8221; house, because they knew that the institution that would own the house after it invariably got repo&rsquo;ed (remember, the receivables on these mortgages were bought and sold numerous times after the mortgage was approved) could afford the tax bill.  Obviously at some point, the housing values wouldn&rsquo;t increase, and in fact, they would have to reverse.  (Even in the absence of economic reasoning, common sense dictates that something that goes up that quickly is going to have to stop going up pretty soon and start going down.)  This is why private industry is not blameless - Someone on staff at all these institutions had to have known this, and sounded the alarm bells off to the top floor.  I&rsquo;m not anybody in particular, and I figured this out.  I can only surmise that at least one person who worked for B of A, Wells Fargo, Goldman, Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, etc figured this out and tried to warn the top floors.  But the top floors weren&rsquo;t paying attention to sound economics and their practitioners, the top floors are full of short tenure high level managerial employees who didn&rsquo;t care what happened to the company past the few years they would serve as CEO or CFO or Vice-President of some crucial division, because their pay was benchmarked to the company&rsquo;s stock prices, and as long as everything seemed rosy for the near future, the stock prices were okay and so were their compensation packages.  Plus, if all else fails, there&rsquo;s always the good ole golden parachute.</p>
<p>2.  &#8220;Okay, QD, you say that the 20% DP requirement kept a lid on housing prices.  But veterans didn&rsquo;t have a high DP requirement, VA loans.  Why didn&rsquo;t the housing market overheat then&#8221;  Answer:  There were a lot of veterans, but they were house hunting in a climate where most people had to have 20% down, and therefore, a climate where the high DP percentage that most people had to have did keep a lid on prices.  It&rsquo;s just that the vets got to put The Pentagon on their list of references, and also, you and I purchased an insurance policy on their mortgages, because we&rsquo;re all supposed to be so grateful that their service of heating green beans in the kitchen at Fort Riley is why we were able to save America from the invading Grenadan Navy or the Panamanian Army and the horrible occupation they would have wrought.</p>
<p>3.  The popping of the real estate bubble was the contributing factor behind the rotten economy we have today.  However, it is my opinion that the fundamentals were bad even before then, if they were good, we would have been able to recover more easily and more quickly.  Our main fundamental weaknesses are de-industrialization (hint:  manufacturing is the most lucrative and the highest value-added method to add value to raw materials), and the dearth of a real energy policy (i.e. based on proven energy sources, not 3.1415926-in-the-sky schemes like solar and wind).  One economist I follow on Twitter thinks that the sudden spike in gas prices in the late winter/early spring 2007 to late fall 2008 time frame was actually the trigger more than anything, because the extra money you have to spend to fill the gas tank wasn&rsquo;t available to make the mortgage note.  Maybe it hurt, but the subprime bubble started popping in mid-2006, so it predated the gas price spike.  In fact, the commodities spikes (not just oil) are probably a result of the housing bubble popping, not the other way around.  The timing supports housing collapse causing oil/metals spikes rather than oil spikes causing housing collapse.</p>
<p>80 The Raven wrote:</p>
<p><i>A $100,000 home may be financed with a fixed rate mortgage of 4.5% over 30 years. Without a downpayment, the average monthly payment will be $506.69 and over the course of 30 years, $82,406 will be paid as interest. If, on the other hand, you paid a 10% down payment of $10,000, the average monthly payment will be $456.02 and the total interest paid will be 74,166.</i></p>
<p>The reality is that the higher the LTV ratio is (i.e. the lower as a percentage of the selling price your down payment is), the higher the interest rate will be.  That&rsquo;s true with most loans, not just mortgages.  However, your fundamental point that the higher % your DP is, the lower your payment will be, is correct.  That is sound economic reasoning, along with the social ramifications of down payments.</p>
<p>83 Heterodox: </p>
<p>Did you watch the last Republican Presidential debate? (The Bloomberg sponsored one in NH). Paul and Gingrich were next to each other, and Nut G. went on about how wasteful the Federal Reserve was and how we found out how treacherous it was in its massive bailout practices, especially to non-American institutions. Paul was sitting right next to him, and I wish he would have said, &#8220;Yeah, we found that out because of my campaign to audit the Fed, and you said in the 1990s that auditing the fed was &#8216;kooky&rsquo; or &#8216;nutty&rsquo; or something like that.&#8221; I know RP made these predictions, IIRC, they were part of Chris Temple&rsquo;s article. However, nobody saw how bad it actually got because nobody thought that an elected Republican President would be so dumb as to pressure the financial system into giving non-down payment mortgages to minority buyers for the sake of non-discrimination. That has been my point all along in this story, that the absolute CRUCIAL element in starting the subprime tragedy was no down payment mortgages, and Bush&rsquo;s demand for them. For all their faults, and for their part in laying the foundation of the subprime tragedy, neither Carter, Clinton nor any real Democrat of consequence ever called for no down payment mortgages. </p>
<p>Steve Sailer&rsquo;s short story might make this whole issue a lot more clear:  <a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2010/03/unreal-estate.html" rel="nofollow">http://isteve.blogspot.com/2010/03/unreal-estate.html</a></p>

		<p>The White liberals of occupy wall street are getting robbed.  I wonder who the robbers are?  OWS will never admit the race of the robbers.  I wonder when the rapes of those White women who don&rsquo;t want their White male leadership to speak will begin? Note that the volunteer security guard is a White man trying to protect those liberal White women who hate him and do not want him to make speeches because he is White.</p>
<p>OWS wanted diversity and inclusion of all races.  They got it.</p>

October 18 2011  New York Post</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street protesters said yesterday that packs of brazen crooks within their ranks have been robbing their fellow demonstrators blind, making off with pricey cameras, phones and laptops   &mdash;   and even a hefty bundle of donated cash and food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealing is our biggest problem at the moment,&rdquo; said Nan Terrie, 18, a kitchen and legal-team volunteer from Fort Lauderdale. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I had my Mac stolen   &mdash;   that was like $5,500. Every night, something else is gone. Last night, our entire [kitchen] budget for the day was stolen, so the first thing I had to do was &hellip; get the message out to our supporters that we needed food!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crafty cat burglars sneaked into the makeshift kitchen at Zuccotti Park overnight and swiped as much as $2,500 in donated greenbacks from right under the noses of volunteers who&rsquo;d fallen asleep after a long day whipping up meals for the hundreds of hungry protesters, the volunteers said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst thing is there&rsquo;s people sleeping in the kitchen when they come, and they don&rsquo;t even know about it! There are some really smart and sneaky thieves here,&rdquo; Terrie said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had umbrellas stolen, a fold-up bed I brought because my back is bad   &mdash;   they took that, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security volunteer Harry Wyman, 22, of Brooklyn was furious about the thievery   &mdash;   and vowed to get tough with the predatory perps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not getting paid, but I&rsquo;m not gonna stand for it. Why people got to come here and do stupid stuff? All it does is make people not wanna come here anymore,&rdquo; Wyman fumed.</p>
<p>At one point yesterday, Wyman and other volunteers briefly scuffled with a man who was standing near a park entrance with a pail calling out: &ldquo;Donations! Donations!&rdquo;   &mdash;   and pocketing the cash people tossed in the bucket.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was at Zuccotti late last night as he and about 50 protesters formed a human chain in front of a medical tent after police officers came over to ask about the tent, cops and protesters said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesse dropped in like a ninja,&rdquo; said Stephanie Perricone, 21. &ldquo;He came out of nowhere and helped us all out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officers were asking about the size of the tent when the crowd of demonstrators   &mdash;   including Jackson   &mdash;   stood en masse in front of it.</p>
<p>The cops said didn&rsquo;t ask for it to be taken down and the issue was quickly resolved. </p>

		<p>&#8220;NOW, Øbama wants to become the world&rsquo;s largest slum landlord by allowing Section 8 to take over these foreclosed properties.</p>
<p>I wonder if this weren&rsquo;t the plan all along!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>I think you are absolutely right Bon. So we the White taxpayers will pay taxes to the federal goverment that will pay the owners of the section 8 houses a much higher rent than can be expected from low income tenants. As more and more poor immigrants pour into California, fair market rents should go lower.</p>
<p>But with the section 8 subsidy the rent will be very high. i understand that private buyers will not be allowed.  Only the banks that already own the foreclosed homes will be section 8 landlords.</p>
<p>That must have been the deal promised to convince the banks to make all those non preforming loans.<br>

		<p>Anon. #78: So, they are giving out $650.00 per week to say in the Park with the other protesters? </p>
<p>Here is what we should do. Those who can, should go and join the protest for a week, or longer, and get the $650.00 for each week there. Then, donate some of that money to American Renaissance, or other such causes, which comes directly from our opponents.</p>
<p>Why not have our adversaries pay us, so we can, in turn, put that money back into our own groups and programs?  </p>
<p>How about opening AmRen Soup Kitchens and Clothing Stores to help our own people? Why should the Leftists capitalize on charity, which is our stregnth? </p>
<p>With every jacket, winter coat, wool hat, pair of gloves, or boots that you give to a homeless person, make sure that you give them web sites for them to use when they go to the local Public Library, and use their computers, or hand them a few printed stories for them to read, and then pass around to their friends. </p>

		<p>Anon. #59: I agree with your post, and must ask people to truly consider what needs to be done, and where the energies of the Protesters of the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; crowd should be directed.</p>
<p>First, they should be demanding that the US get out of the UN, and that the UN get out of these sovereign United States.</p>
<p>For those of you who had missed it, US Military Forces have now occupied another country, Uganda, a few days ago. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, the majority of the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; crowd are big Barry supporters, so there has been not one word of protest of this latest US intervension; but if G.W. Bush was still in the D.C., they would be screaming bloody murder. So they care, but only when the Republican is sending Troops somewhere. Typical. </p>
<p>Once we move to get out of the UN, and all other global Institutions that rap around us like a Boa Constrictor, we can then have these people protest the Federal Reserve, which is no more Federal, than Federal Express. </p>
<p>They can protest in favor of the US Treasury being placed back in charge of coining our money, and printing any Official Notes that need to be circulated by the Government. </p>
<p>The only Candidate that has been consistent with this type of message has been Ron Paul, and he needs all of us to support him, or we can look forward to a guy like Rick Perry being the GOP choice, and Barry for another four years. Some choice. </p>
<p>Write a check, collect signatures for your State ballot, and remember to Vote in your Primary for Ron Paul. </p>

		<p>Bon #83: I was talking to a few Neighbors about different things, when the topic of a few foreclosed homes in the area came up.</p>
<p>One family was known by two of my Neighbors, but the rest, of course, living several blocks away were unknown to us. </p>
<p>Then one of my Neighbors came up with getting a group of people in the area together, to buy one or more of the properties, to rent, and make some steady income. </p>
<p>This would be an investment group, and we could keep our Cities from falling into further disrepair by doing something positive. </p>
<p>Also, vacant homes, with notices on their front doors, and grass that is overgrown, are not only eyesores, but are targets for Squatters to break in and make themselves at home. </p>
<p>People who squat come complete with drug use, alcoholism, prostitution, and all the other vices of Society that we do not want in our Neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Renting to good families, even to those that were just dispossessed of the same houses, would at least keep them in the same area, and allow them the opportunity to get back on their feet, even buying the house back again, if that should ever become possible. </p>
<p>The continuity of the Neighborhood would be preserved, where we already know our Neighbors, who are also good friends, and their children could continue their education at the same School, without having to be uprooted, and moved either across the State, or out of State.</p>

		<p>Before this thread gets away, here&rsquo;s a really &#8220;nice&#8221; piece of news relevant to my long posts above. </p>
<p>Fox News Channel:  <a href="http://goo.gl/mYjwU" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/mYjwU</a></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Senators Draft Bill to Give Visas to Foreigners Buying Pricey Homes</p>
<p>The reeling housing market has come to this: To shore it up, two Senators are preparing to introduce a bipartisan bill Thursday that would give residence visas to foreigners who spend at least $500,000 to buy houses in the U.S. </p>
<p>The provision is part of a larger package of immigration measures, co-authored by Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mike Lee, R-Utah, designed to spur more foreign investment in the U.S. </p>
<p>(snip)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Now this would be the kind of treachery Schumer would sign on to, but Mike Lee?  I thought he was supposed to be in essence a Tea Party Senator.  Disappointed?  Very.  But then I remembered that his state&rsquo;s ex-Governor, now running for President, Jon Huntsman, constantly rides this hobby horse of &#8220;we need H-xB legal immigrants to get the price of housing back up&#8221; in every debate.  (See my long posts above for the foolishness of that.)  </p>
<p>So, we have two Utah politicians and a New York politician demanding more legal immigrant visa holders to make real estate more expensive.  Then it hit me like a brick:  Manhattan and Park City, Utah.  Those two places are always toward the very top of the most expensive housing zip codes in the country.  Any New York statewide elected politician of the Democrat Party is going to pass the hat around on Manhattan Island, and while Park City and its ski resorts are full of non-residents who have second houses there, they surely dump a lot of money on Utah political candidates.  Schumer, Lee and Huntsman are basically responding to their big money contributors who only care about the &#8220;value&#8221; of their condos and ski resorts.</p>
