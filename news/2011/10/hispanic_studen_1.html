<h1>Hispanic Students Vanish from Alabama Schools</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jay Reeves, Yahoo! News, September 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p> Hispanic students have started vanishing from Alabama public schools in the wake of a court ruling that upheld the state&rsquo;s tough new law cracking down on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Education officials say scores of immigrant families have withdrawn their children from classes or kept them home this week, afraid that sending the kids to school would draw attention from authorities.</p>
<p>There are no precise statewide numbers. But several districts with large immigrant enrollments  &mdash;  from small towns to large urban districts  &mdash;  reported a sudden exodus of children of Hispanic parents, some of whom told officials they planned to leave the state to avoid trouble with the law, which requires schools to check students&rsquo; immigration status.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
	<br>
In Montgomery County, more than 200 Hispanic students were absent the morning after the judge&rsquo;s Wednesday ruling. A handful withdrew.</p>
<p>In tiny Albertville, 35 students withdrew in one day. And about 20 students in Shelby County, in suburban Birmingham, either withdrew or told teachers they were leaving.</p>
<p>Local and state officials are pleading with immigrant families to keep their children enrolled. The law does not ban anyone from school, they say, and neither students nor parents will be arrested for trying to get an education.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The law does not require proof of citizenship to enroll, and it does not apply to any students who were enrolled before Sept. 1. While most students are not affected, school systems are supposed to begin checking the status of first-time enrollees now.</p>
<p>The Obama administration filed court documents Friday announcing its plans to appeal the ruling that upheld the law.</p>

		<p>I hope that fear of the law is the case.  However, I fear that the real reason they&rsquo;re &#8220;vanishing&#8221; is because it&rsquo;s all result of top-down activism, i.e. keeping Hispanic kids out of school in order to engineer agitprop against the Alabama immigration law.</p>

Elected officals? If so, the constituents of these officals should demand to know why they insist on spending THEIR taxpayer dollars educating people that should not be here in the first place, especially when almost every state in the union is nearly broke.</p>

		<p>On the local TV news here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, there was a report a few days ago that one of the local &#8220;latino tiendas&#8221; was closing since half or more of their customers were illegals and had left. The owner stated off-camera that she was closing up shop and moving too!</p>
<p>If this had happened a year ago, a 17-year old girl from our neighborhood might still be alive. She was killed by a drunken illegal Mexican who was speeding at 100mph and ran a red light. He&rsquo;s in jail and will be for many years to come. Of course he will now cost the taxpayers of Alabama $25,000 to $30,000 per year. </p>
<p>The saddest part is that this young lady would have been a freshman honor student this semester at The University of Alabama and would have gone on to be a productive member of society.</p>

		<p>Again, there is terrible over exaggeration with this law. You will only be questioned if you have broken a law of some sort. A felony or traffic offense, etc. Something that brings you to the attention of the cops and not some cops just randomly stopping you and asking you a lot of questions.</p>

		<p>If laws like this were enacted in all 50 states and a couple of divisions were redeployed from the awesome land war in Asia&hellip;</p>
<p>To the Mexican border&hellip;or if a couple of divisions were disbanded and re-hired as border guards or something&hellip;</p>
<p>No problem but repatriation real fast!</p>
<p>We have to control our borders.  I don&rsquo;t want a billion of anybody&rsquo;s bodys blighting this beautiful country.  Caucasians, East-Asians, and some others seem to have figured out the magical K-style birth method and how if practiced by all, such leads to higher standards of living, higher standards of morality, and just plain higher standards.</p>
<p>Unfortunately some geneto-ethnicities seem to have a hard time with this concept and regardless - keep letting them come in, whoever they are, and not enforcing the laws of the land and within the lifetime of our children&rsquo;s children we could see close to a billion living here.</p>
<p>Not a good idea.  </p>
<p>And the swarm of &#8220;them&#8221; breeding prodigiously out there, beyond the walls we must build eventually, both physical and institutional?</p>

		<p>For months, America has been told by left-wing non-profits like the Alien Criminals Liberation Union (ACLU), La Raza and LULAC, that Alabama&rsquo;s new immigration law H.B. 56,  &ldquo;targets Hispanics&rdquo; and is &ldquo;anti-Latino&ldquo;. </p>
<p>Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn wisely ignored that rhetoric when she let stand (pending trial) the law&rsquo;s most critical section – having police check immigration status of individuals apprehended in a lawful stop or arrest.</p>
<p>Well, the very first such arrest has now occurred since the Judge&rsquo;s ruling. And – surprise, he  is not from Mexico, or any other Latino American nation.  He is Mohamed Ali Muflahi, 24, from&hellip;Yemen!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, the same lovely nation where we just killed a terror-linked cleric with a drone missile, and the home of the &ldquo;most dangerous branch&rdquo; of Al-Qaeda, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Muflahi was arrested for obstructing a government operation during a drug raid in Etowah County. He did not have documentation, and so his immigration status was checked – per the new law. It was determined he was in the U.S. illegally, and was &ldquo;charged with violation of the immigration law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Why in the world would any American citizen, (let alone a state official &#8220;plead&#8221; with these parasites to stay anywhere within our borders! There are too many in positions of leadership in this country, in their quest for diversity, have lost their collective minds regarding this issue.</p>
<p>We are going to be in a world of hurt is we do not change this mindset, and fast regarding the Mexican colonizers!  </p>

		<p>Others have already touched on it, but this point must be re-emphasized. These aliens aren&rsquo;t going home - so this is but a partial victory, as it shows that the laws work and is good for Alabama, of course. But again, as others note, they just go somewhere else&hellip;in America! </p>
<p>So unless all 50 states, or at least most of them pass similar laws, this is just going to become a huge Hispanic juggling act. Although, perhaps if the relctant states surrounding those who DO pass these laws get an influx of impoverished, illiterate aliens, they may think again about their own stance. It&rsquo;s all a bizarre shell-game of sorts now, since our &#8220;leaders&#8221; are just too cowardly to do what is right and must be done - that is mass deportation!!</p>

		<p>What Hispanics? Red or White? Spain is a white European nation who founded the western hemisphere and roughly 25% of the white European population in America is of spanish origin not to mention the other nations like Cuba and Equador Brazil etc who have majority white European white race populations and make no bones about it. </p>
<p>Whites need to wake up and stop being ignorant about the whites of their race who speak other tongues but they are brainwashed by public education and of course the media. As far as misegenation some whites are too ignorant understand that whites in other nations are much more conservative and remain pure in their white race speaking Spanish or Portuguese. </p>

<p>I see this same sentiment echoed time and time again and I have to disagree. The mestizo invasion did not start just yesterday nor will it be defeated overnight. Many will choose to simply cross statelines. Many will opt to go to states where the freebies are currently plentiful. This will expose the liberal lie of illegal immigration being good for the economy. Arizona was merely the first domino to fall - as the invaders move from state to state - more and more will have but no choice but to take action and purge themselves from these freeloaders. </p>
<p>Once Obama is shown the door, and God willing, a true conservative takes oath, I would expect the cleansing to hasten.</p>

		<p>Most of the illegal aliens in the US ARE &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; from Mexico, Central or South America, but this is not the whole picture.There are  varying numbers of illegal invaders from many other countries, too. The main point of the law ought to be the word ILLEGAL. If you are in the United States ILLEGALLY it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you came here from Guatemala, Ireland, Jamaica, or someplace in the Middle East&hellip;you are here ILLEGALLY and  should be deported to your country of origin immediately.   </p>

<p>Yes but for every empty seat they won&rsquo;t need that &#8220;allowance&#8221;. For every &#8220;empty seat&#8221; thats one less illegal ( I&rsquo;m sorry, to me an anchor baby is NOT an American ) getting a &#8220;free&#8221; school breakfast and lunch, one less getting &#8220;free&#8221; bilingual education and tutoring, one less getting &#8220;free&#8221; school supplies, one less  getting &#8220;free&#8221; medical care and clogging up the E.R., one less getting &#8220;free&#8221; food with food stamps, one less to have to provide a &#8220;free&#8221; home. I don&rsquo;t see how they&rsquo;d be losing. If anything, every &#8220;empty seat&#8221; would translate into a gain. </p>

<p>Even blue states like Massachusetts are getting a lot of heat from the people and even the media.  First Obama&rsquo;s Aunt Zeituni was found to have been illegally living in the country for many years.  During this time she was occupying a public subsidized apartment and no doubt she had to be getting other forms of welfare.  Then Obama&rsquo;s uncle who has also been in the country illegally for many years, gets caught driving drunk.  The final straw was the death of a motorcyclist at the hands of an illegal alien drunk driver who had been stopped for drunk driving a number of times.  The governor is getting a lot of heat.  Even the media has to cover these three high profile illegal alien stories. The illegals have jumped the shark, as they say.</p>

<p>Your points are all valid. All those freebies would get cut off. Ultimately, there would be a surplus of teachers and administrators, whose jobs would be on the chopping block. That&rsquo;s what will have them worried.</p>
<p>Which isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. It&rsquo;s been my experience that school districts are top heavy with &#8220;administrators&#8221; who suck up six figure salaries while the teachers inthe classrooms are paying for photocopies and other supplies out of their own pockets. </p>

		<p>Aunt Zeituni was on SSI disability although she like all the other SSI disability immigrants (mostly asian) had never worked a day in her life in America and contributed not one cent to the social security funds.</p>
<p>I wonder how much Americans who worked under social security from the time ther were 16 would be getting every month were it not for these foreign pensioners getting $900 per month?</p>
<p>Contribute $250 per month from age 25 to 65 with smaller amounts from teenage and college jobs and get $1,200 per month.  Contribute absolutely not 1 cent to social security and get $900<br>
per month.</p>
<p>Our goverment wants us dead.</p>
<p>Wonder what Americans with 45 years in social security will be getting in 20 years.  Wonder what foreigners non White foreigners that is who never contributed one cent to social security will be getting in 20 years.</p>
<p>The Americans will probably get $600 per month and the foreigners $6,000 per month.</p>

		<p>&#8221; The final straw was the death of a motorcyclist at the hands of an illegal alien drunk driver who had been stopped for drunk driving a number of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>That particular illegal vechicular murderer also had 6 felony convictions and was under a deportation order.  Onlookers had to stop him from escaping with the victim still attached to the car by jumping on the hood and blocking the intersection with their cars.</p>
<p>Once stopped this illegal hispanic reversed and finally killed the victim by running him over with the wheels.  The unspeakable illegal has an anchor baby.</p>
<p>America hates us and wants us dead.  </p>
<p>Anyone know if Deval Patrick is pressuring the local DA to reduce the charges?  <br>
I assume that ADL AJC SPLC LARAZA MALDEF  and the other exterminate Whites organizations is pressuring Professors Dershowitz  and Chernowitz to defend the murderer.</p>
