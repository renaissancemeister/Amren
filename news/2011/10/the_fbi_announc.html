<h1><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-gang-assessment-us-military-2011-10">The FBI Announces Gangs Have Infiltrated Every Branch of the Military</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Robert Johnson, Business Insider, October 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The FBI has released a new gang assessment announcing that there are 1.4 million gang members in the US, a 40 percent increase since 2009, and that many of these members are getting inside the military (via Stars and Stripes).</p>
<p>The report says the military has seen members from 53 gangs and 100 regions in the U.S. enlist in every branch of the armed forces. Members of every major street gang, some prison gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMGs) have been reported on both U.S. and international military installations.</p>
<p>From the report:</p>
<blockquote>Through transfers and deployments, military-affiliated gang members expand their culture and operations to new regions nationwide and worldwide, undermining security and law enforcement efforts to combat crime. Gang members with military training pose a unique threat to law enforcement personnel because of their distinctive weapons and combat training skills and their ability to transfer these skills to fellow gang members.</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<blockquote>Many street gang members join the military to escape the gang lifestyle or as an alternative to incarceration, but often revert back to their gang associations once they encounter other gang members in the military. Other gangs target the U.S. military and defense systems to expand their territory, facilitate criminal activity such as weapons and drug trafficking, or to receive weapons and combat training that they may transfer back to their gang. Incidents of weapons theft and trafficking may have a negative impact on public safety or pose a threat to law enforcement officials.</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment">full assessment</a> is definitely worth checking out, if only for the pictures.<br>

		<p>I &#8216;ve read articles on this topic in the past. It really started 20 or more years ago, during the 1st Gulf War. Of course that was also at the height of the crack cocaine epidemic here in the US. Many service members were partial to their &#8216;hoods, or so they claimed. Many were black, poor, came from ghettoes (everything you hear from the left that tries to get people to pull out the violin for these sociopaths). But I no longer by into that old adage, help the poor blacks out. I got to help out my own kind first. As far as this article talking of the gangbangers going back to their criminal elements, that is about as surprising as hearing a fish, once caught on a boat, wants to get back in the water. Which brings me to this point. Most of these types can&rsquo;t be rehabilitated. Most don&rsquo;t want to be helped because it is too much fun to rob, rape, sell dope, run from cops, steal cars and murder. The poor babies don&rsquo;t like it so much when they get caught. Stick them on islands throughout the US. Island prisons break down a criminal psychologicaaly like nothing else could. Bring back Alcatraz. </p>

<p>EVERYONE, READ THE LINKED FBI REPORT.  IT IS STAGGERING.  WE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE.  IF THE MSM RAN THIS STORY THERE WOULD BE A NATIONAL PANIC.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to band together, put aside petty differences.  But regardless of what we do, only a concerted, AGGRESSIVE, Federal and local effort far beyond the type that we saw during Prohibition. All we can do is group up locally, create neighborhood watch style communications and prepare, prepare, prepare, NOW.</p>
<p>The future is here.</p>

		<p>This is why whites who have been in the military need to band together with other whites and form paramilitary forces to protect ourselves from the non-white gangs. White police officers are already using their military training to arrest or kill non-white gangbangers who were in the military. All whites must learn how to use a rifle well enough to engage and kill attackers at least 400 yards away, and arm themselves. There is going to be massive slaughters against white Americans sooner than later as this country Balkanizes and fractures internally while at the same time invaders seeking to kill or displace us flood in from the outside. In other words, war is coming and our uniform will be our white skin. The only way to safeguard whites ultimately is a whites only homeland where non-whites will be unwelcome and expelled by force.</p>

		<p>The military reflects our affirmative action diverse population.  What can we expect?</p>
<p>I skimmed through the report looking for SPLC ADL propaganda inserts.  I didn&rsquo;t find any SPLC ADL falsehoods.</p>
<p>Over all, I was pleasantly surprised to find a federal agency not totally biased against Whites.</p>
<p>Maybe the FBI has not been corrupted by ADL SPLC hate Whitey seminars as ATF, DOJ and state and local law enforcement.  Or perhaps they learned not to rely on SPLC ADL information from the Weaver family murders.</p>

		<p>I am active duty Navy.  I cannot believe the FBI had to conduct an investigation to figure a gang problem exists within the military.  They could have just asked ANY enlisted person and gotten &#8220;yes&#8221; as an answer.  I assume they did the investigation just to find the names of the gangs, I bet they never release the racial make-up of the gangs seeing how White people probably only make up 5% the gang members.  Of course the members who exit the military teach others the tactics and procedures they learned, I know I would.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this nice? Instead of prison they get to choose to be in OUR military? We all know most of these gangs are mostly black and mexican (illegals) and assorted nonwhites, don&rsquo;t we? We also KNOW that those in charge of allowing this nonsense know full well that these gang members and nonwhites should never be allowed in our military. They will just get the resources and knowledge of how to fight us in the end. And most of us think our military will protect us? Those in power when the time comes, will unleash these nonwhite &#8220;soldiers&#8221; against White Americans and we know it. Take a look at the U.N. forces and this is exactly what they have turned our military into. FOR A REASON.</p>

		<p>The biker gangs got a couple kids in the Navy, but these blacks are really going for the gold in enlisting. They want to have that VA loan when they get out, you know they are so smart with real estate. HAHA! ALSO female blacks are everywhere in the NAVY. Always in a Rating they do not belong, these female types have zero work ethic. If a black woman takes an engineering RATE she is pushed through to E-4 Petty officer third class super fast, eventhough she knows nothing, also in the NAVY soon they will have female blacks that are enlisted serving aboard Submarines. (they have female officers now)Now you know they only take certain whitemen that really want to be a Submariner. but no doubt these female blacks will be given priority over a more qualified Man.</p>

		<p>This country will collapse due to third world diversity and there will still be multiculturalists insisting that it is a strength.  The psychological conditioning is far too embedded to convince them otherwise.  But is it really their fault?  They grew up being bombarded with leftwing indoctrination.  Many are too young to have experienced an 80-85%+ White country so they have nothing to compare multiculturalism to other than what they read in textbooks.  And those textbooks are decidedly anti-White, are they not?  We, on the other hand, have experienced both and therefore are able to compare the two based on firsthand knowledge rather than what we read in some agenda-driven textbook.  So here we are, a military being overrun with ethnic gang members that will one day turn those guns on their own citizens.  Unheard of even 30 years ago.  For what it will be worth, at least we will have been proven right.  </p>

		<p>It is very sad to see how this country is being destroyed bit by bit while the politicians pretend everything is fine and dandy especially because this country is getting less and less white and getting more racially inclusive.  Mexico is currently fighting a big battle against former special trained military units, now called Zetas who turned into a drug cartel.  The big question is not if but when this country will eventually crash.</p>

		<p>YES, it would seem that the military is no longer a place where youngsters go to grow up and mature, in some cases straighten out, I heard on the talk show (the gentleman from San Francisco) first name Michael, that he belongs to the Navy league and attends events in honour of the Navy, one swabie told him candidly that gang bangers run around the ship top side during the night, the hang out there, etc, WHAT? if this is true, then what the hell is going on there on board our vessels are there not ODs are there no more master at Arms, it unbelievable, given the viscous nature of these people I am surprised that we have not heard of killings and the like, just think about this real hard, say your a NCO or officer in any branch of Armed Forces, OPPs&hellip;. Uniformed Services and you have one of these people in your unit and he does like the way he&rsquo;s being talked to and he mouths of and you discipline him you know stuff that&rsquo;s been going on ever since there was soldiers and sailors, although in the past punishments where very severe, in any event I would thing that the dis code will mandate the killing of the NCO/officer or at the very least a beat down, is this already happening and the Bush/Obama regimes covering it up ?</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it too much. Most blacks in the Military occupy low-skill jobs like cooks, drivers, fuel handlers, supply, etc. They&rsquo;re not even remotely qualified to be mechanics, to be honest. That said, most of them only get the cursory amount of tactical training, and even then it is maybe only twice a year when they actually qualify on their individual weapon system. Anyone leaving the Military holding one of the combat service support MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) positions will be poorly trained for combat at best. Besides the fact that blacks are incredibly lazy, and getting them to collaborate on a training event is like trying to herd cats. Really, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about this at all. People think that just because someone is in the Military they are hardcore, do 20KM ruck marches, thousands of pushups, personally killed Saddam, etc. If only the general public knew how much of a welfare system the Military has become. Single, black females with multiple children (can&rsquo;t get rid of them if they have a family care plan), black males running the promotion system, masons (exclusive club you can only get into if you are black), all EO reps are black or hispanic (how&rsquo;s that for irony?), rampant drug use and DUIs (usually excused if the Sergeant Major is black and both are masons. God forbid you are White and get one. Your career is over), more STDs than you can shake a stick at, theft, rape, child abuse&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, the Military has done such a good job at incorporating all walks of life that I really wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the combat effectiveness of the average black soldier these days. Except, of course, if we go to war again&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have to agree with #16 on this one. Most of the blacks in the Navy &amp; Marines were POG&rsquo;s. This is supply &amp; logistics (where the money for theft can be made), cooks, janitor, truck drivers, mechanics for the few with skills.  The insanity with promoting black females (and females period) is beyond belief to anyone that has not witnessed it first hand. Removing a black female is damn near impossible as well, even if their evaluations are terrible. Even the ones on drugs, it takes repeated violations, and rehab failures to get them out. </p>
<p><br>
I had two jobs contracting for the Navy &amp; Marines. Pretty much all of the interesting work that requires genuine IT skills has been outsourced. I&rsquo;m thinking back on how bad it was in 1999, and I can&rsquo;t imagine that 2011 is an improvement. In 1999 they couldn&rsquo;t even tune their antenna arrays themselves, they had to outsource for it.  </p>

		<p>Actually, it&rsquo;s not something suppressed. I remember an episode from a rather &#8220;liberal&#8221; &amp; stereotypical series, &#8220;Cold case&#8221; (the main protagonist was Lily Rush something, played by Katherine (?) Morris). It was about recruiting gang members for Afghanistan or Iraq. Of course, everything was deeply &#8220;educational&#8221;, pathetic &amp; faux emotional. But, the topic was addressed.  </p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t worry me if it were just White gang members, at least they are White. But, we know most are nonwhite, and when they get out they will use the skills they learned against us and against America. Just like the Zetas are now doing, that OUR military trained in the first place, have all walked across our border and inflicting their damage across the nation. Our own military have trained far too many of our enemies all over the world and then the chickens come home to roost. Thanks Oliver North.</p>

		<p>Gangs have always been in the military.  They&rsquo;re in the police forces in the large urban areas also, like Chicago and New York.</p>
<p>Now that the Obama administration has pressured cities and counties to hire unqualified blacks we&rsquo;ll see even more of it.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one BIG reason I&rsquo;d like to see the police defunded even more so than they have been&hellip;&hellip;..and they will be.  The economic drop is still in full swing.</p>

		<p>We get this story almost every year.  What disturbs me, though it does not surprise me, is that we keep getting it every year.  What that means is that TPTB know the problem but can&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t do anything about it.  That is because solving the problem would mean depriving the military of that all-important diversity that the desk generals think is so important.</p>

		<p>Listen the all volunteer military brought this on. Gerald Ford gave birth to this beast and it has really hurt the country. </p>
<p>Number one it has disengaged the public from our military foriegn policy. That is if we were in a draft situation today the wars for profit in the middle east would not have lasted this long. Hell they may have never been started. </p>
<p>Number two young folks now a days don&rsquo;t believe they owe any service to thier country. It has become a social program for incompetent blacks, now gays and bad women who sleep their way to the top. </p>
<p>Number 3 the better and brighter in the military still exist but they are dwindling in number and if the military were allowed to draft they could eliminate and pick more of the good. </p>
<p>We are in a downward spiral bad to worse. </p>

		<p>Blacks may serve in lowly positions in the military BUT have access to military -grade weapons.  The real danger is that these weapons are showing up in mexican and black gangs on the streets.</p>
<p>The following is from a military site   &mdash;   which the financial newsletters I read use  knowing government stats are mostly untrustworthy AND, for investment advice, to get the best info as to what the military is using :</p>
<p><i>Gang members in the military are commonly assigned to military support units where they have access to weapons and explosives. Military personnel may steal items by improperly documenting supply orders or by falsifying paperwork. Law enforcement officials throughout the United States have recovered military-issued weapons and explosives-such as machine guns and grenades-from criminals and gang members while conducting search warrants and routine traffic stops.</i></p>
<p><i>An interview with a former Marine and Gangster Disciple member incarcerated in Colorado detailed how easily soldiers-many of whom were gang members-stole military weapons and equipment and used them on the streets of US cities or sold them to civilian gang members.</i></p>

		<p>Some experts estimate that 1 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. military are gang members including both officers and enlisted. That&rsquo;s between 14,000 and 30,000 active duty military personnel who are gang members not counting reserves and national guard. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what military specialty that are in. Many are in non-combat jobs specifically so they can steal anything and everything as well as transport stolen goods and drugs world-wide. That compares with just 0.02 percent of the U.S. population believed to be gang members.</p>
<p>To quote one report: &ldquo;Among the most disconcerting &#8220;operations&#8221; carried out by gang members in the military involve the theft and trafficking of weapons. In 2006, for instance, &#8220;an incarcerated US Army soldier and active gang member identified 60 to 70 gang-affiliated military personnel in his unit allegedly involved in the theft and sale of military equipment and weapons. The solider reported that many of the military personnel in charge of ammunition and grenade distribution are sergeants who are active gang members. The soldier also reported that military commanders were aware of the actions of these gang-affiliated personnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gang-related activity in the military is highly underreported, and the Army is the only branch of the military that collects gang-related statistics. It&rsquo;s often in the military&rsquo;s best interest to keep these incidents quiet. The relaxation of recruiting standards, recruiter misconduct and the military&rsquo;s lack of enforcement have compounded the problem and allowed gang member presence in the military to proliferate.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just service members.  You have the same thing with military family members and federal civilian employees and contractors. Walk into a federal building and see uniformed security personnel flash gang signs. See how federal civilians claim EEO discrimination if their vehicles get randomly searched for stolen property. See how the federal government turns a blind eye to gang members hired as border patrol agents (even as hundreds are arrested). </p>
<p>BTW, when you read the report, you will see that civilian law enforcement is a prime area for gang members to join.</p>
<p>How did this happen?  Part of the reason for the military was the need for warm bodies.  They were taking just about anyone with a pulse.  Due to the recession, they can set higher standards but they are still under tremendous pressure to ensure diversity at all rank levels, even if it means lowered standards.</p>
<p>ALL aspects of our lives have become far more open to gang influence than they should be due to diversity.  When you lower overall standards to ensure greater minority representation, you lower it for everyone including whites. </p>
<p>The most terrifying thing about this though is what happens if, in the near future, this country experiences urban riots where the national guard, reserves and active duty units are brought in for security purposes. Will we citizens be able to trust them, will their fellow soldiers be able to trust each other?  Gang members will be loyal to their military units until gangs tell them otherwise. Same with security/law enforcement personnel. Once a gang member, always a gang member.  Gangs have the stronger tie.  </p>
<p>Keep that in mind if something happens in your city.<br>

<p>&#8220;Actually, it&rsquo;s not something suppressed. I remember an episode from a rather &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; &amp; stereotypical series, &ldquo;Cold case&rdquo; (the main protagonist was Lily Rush something, played by Katherine (?) Morris). It was about recruiting gang members for Afghanistan or Iraq. Of course, everything was deeply &ldquo;educational&rdquo;, pathetic &amp; faux emotional. But, the topic was addressed. &#8220;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe the complacency of so many posts here.  I would think that Amren posters would be sophisticated enough to understand how the media normalizes things like this through making shows that use a &#8220;compelling&#8221; story to deconstruct reality, or normalize the outrageous.  Yes, there&rsquo;s also &#8220;The Sons of Anarchy.&#8221;  This is a show about a white biker gang in the San Joaquin Valley of California.  Then, there&rsquo;s &#8220;Breaking Bad.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s so cool to watch our social decline mimed out on a TV show, eh?</p>
<p>It amazes me how little real thinking is going on among us.  Rather than the typical conservative knee-jerk reactions, try connecting some dots.  For example, we know that in Arizona, Mexican advocate groups have commented on the idea that there will be a racial civil war within 5 years and he is recommending that all Hispanics arm themselves.  No big deal that blacks and Hispanics are in supply?  My brother in law was in Vietnam and ended up teaching demolitions in California.  He made off with a collection of ordinance with no problem.  I&rsquo;ve heard other stories of white soldiers who took lethal &#8220;souvenirs&#8221; from their military service period.  So some of this has always gone on, but it is epidemic now and being done with a subversive, military vision. Add to this the fact that the 1914 San Diego Plan, which calls for all the white males over 16 to be killed as part of a Mexican takeover of the Southwest, and that this has been being taught at elementary schools in Arizona, and we can grasp that somethings cooking that hasn&rsquo;t been done before.  And let&rsquo;s not let that idea lull us into complacency.  I remember how I was raised hearing the brag that no foreign country had ever bombed America.  </p>
<p>Yes luckily, the elite services remain mostly white men, but the National Guard won&rsquo;t be so unified when police are further defunded and crime invades your quiet, all white community.  It&rsquo;s already there, you just don&rsquo;t know it - yet.  I also read yesterday that the oil boom in North Dakota has brought crime like drugs and prostitution to formerly white, Christian communities.  They say that while the money is nice, they wish they had their old lives back.  Many local young women have become strippers because it is so lucrative.  No doubt, the Somali gangs operating nearby are providing underage white girls for the entertainment of all the men who showed up for the jobs, jobs that they say can be had by any able bodied man who shows up with at least a GED.  Maybe not even that. So if you really want a job, go to North Dakota, it&rsquo;s a real party there!</p>
<p>If we refer to Chittum&rsquo;s &#8220;Civil War 2&#8221;, we can see that he predicted that the big issue initially will control of the military.  He recommends living no closer than 10 miles from any military base.  Now, we can see why.  The military will host a big shooting gang war once things break down far enough.  While that goes on, crime in general will climb to a point that you will be defending your personal property and lives from plundering.</p>
<p>I hope all of this is wrong, but I see no reverse of the trends of the last 20-30 years.  As the intensity increases, so does the speed of the breakdown.  So don&rsquo;t imagine that just making sarcastic comments, or demanding a more conservative, religious return will fix everything.  It&rsquo;s way beyond that.</p>

		<p>Some experts estimate that 1 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. military are gang members including both officers and enlisted. That&rsquo;s between 14,000 and 30,000 active duty military personnel who are gang members not counting reserves and national guard. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what military specialty that are in. Many are in non-combat jobs specifically so they can steal anything and everything as well as transport stolen goods and drugs world-wide. That compares with just 0.02 percent of the U.S. population believed to be gang members.<br>
To quote one report: &ldquo;Among the most disconcerting &#8220;operations&#8221; carried out by gang members in the military involve the theft and trafficking of weapons.

		<p>I was in the Reagan Army, the Bush I Army and the Clinton Army (Reagan Army was the best of the bunch).  Whites were, and are, attracted to the most dangerous MOS&rsquo;s, and the MOS&rsquo;s requiring lots of mental horsepower&hellip;  Like an earlier poster said, Blacks and Latinos gravitate towards MOS&rsquo;s that do not require lots of mental horsepower, MOS&rsquo;s that would put them in harms way or MOS&rsquo;s that require a high security clearance.</p>
<p>Outside of actual combat MOS&rsquo;s, MOST (not all) combat support troops receive very little actual combat training.  Qualify a couple times a year with a rifle or sidearm, at most.  And then Blacks and Mexicans only BARELY qualify with their weapon.  It is rare that a black or mexican actually qualifies Expert (at least from what I have seen).</p>
<p>Whites, especially rural white males, who grew up outdoors hunting and also with the instruction from their Fathers (who are likely vets and/or hunters themselves) on how to shoot properly have always made the best combat soldiers.  (Although I am biased as a Southerner)  I do have to offer one caveat:  I have seen white males from big cities take to their training very quickly&hellip; impressive for city boys.</p>
<p>Like OVERSEAS said:  Don&rsquo;t worry too much about the gang-bangers obtaining serious combat skills in the military.  I would take the old guys from the VFW down the street over gang-bangers anyday&hellip; and trust them to get my back in a scrape, too.</p>

This homosexual, illegal immigrant, feminist, reverse racist military of today I would not have bothered to join. I&rsquo;d have hopped on a plane and joined the French Foreign Legion and then gone merc. It makes more sense for a young white male in America that wants a military life to do that then join what passes for the U.S. military anymore.</p>
