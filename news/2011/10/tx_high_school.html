			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Madeleine Morganstern, The Blaze, October 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students in a Texas public high school were made to stand up and recite the Mexican national anthem and Mexican pledge of allegiance as part of a Spanish class assignment, but the school district maintains there was nothing wrong with the lesson.</p>
<p>It happened last month in an intermediate Spanish class at Achieve Early College High School in McAllen, Texas  &mdash;  a city located about 10 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Wearing red, white and green, students had to memorize the Mexican anthem and pledge and stand up and recite them in individually in front of the class.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t go over well with sophomore Brenda Brinsdon. The 15-year-old sat down and refused to participate. She also caught it all on video:</p>
<p><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YC3xejOJyrI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p><br>
&#8220;I just thought it was out of hand, I didn&rsquo;t think it was right,&#8221; she told The Blaze. &#8220;Reciting pledges to Mexico and being loyal to it has nothing to do with learning Spanish.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brinsdon said she complained to the school principal, Yvette Cavazo, who told her it was part of the curriculum and that she should participate. Her father, William, also got involved, calling the school district superintendent to complain.</p>
<p>When Brenda made clear she would not stand up and recite the pledge, she was given an alternative assignment: an essay on the history of the Mexican revolution.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>William Brinsdon is still having a hard time fathoming the idea of reciting foreign pledges and anthems in a U.S. public school in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our kids don&rsquo;t even know the [American] national anthem and here we are&hellip;teaching them to memorize and perform the national anthem for Mexico,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just think it&rsquo;s so backwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s one thing for the Glenn Becks of the world (The Blaze is Beck&rsquo;s news website) to tell us of these travesties.  It would have been nice, though, if the Glenn Becks of the world now and in the past would have supported immigration restriction for explicitly racial reasons.</p>

		<p>The Muslims as part of Islamic awareness in the class room do this sort of thing too. Make you repeat the shahada, the Islamic testament of faith. According to Islamic law, when you recite the shahada, you become a Muslim, whether you know it or not.</p>

		<p>Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses don&rsquo;t recite the pledge.  Lots of black militants don&rsquo;t either.  That&rsquo;s the pledge of allegiance to the U.S.  Brenda shouldn&rsquo;t have to pledge allegiance to Mexico.  Some schools won&rsquo;t even let the kids wear clothing with the American flag.  Wasn&rsquo;t there a riot over the flag at a school in California last year, with the Mexicans attacking the white American kids?</p>

		<p>Ummm&hellip; Didn&rsquo;t the Spanish language, as Mexicans know it, originate in SPAIN?  </p>
<p>What on earth does the Mexican anthem have to do with learning the Spanish language?</p>
<p>Incidents like this will only become more frequent.  As a high school teacher I can tell you more and more students will call bull and refuse this indoctrination.  I hope.</p>

		<p>If this were Mexico then it&rsquo;s normal to recite the national anthem of Mexico. But this is the US we are talking about. Are the &#8216;multi-cult&rsquo; people going to demand that other countries follow suit? I hope not. I hope more people wake up to this insanity. Demanding an American girl to recite the Mexican national anthem in Texas, USA is unacceptable under any circumstance. If Americans moved to Mexico en masse and demanded the US national anthem to be sung in Mexican schools, Mexican people would be rightfully angry. Why don&rsquo;t they understand Americans would be angry if they did the same thing in American schools? Respect never goes both ways for these multi-cult people. It&rsquo;s sickening. </p>

<p> Brenda Brinsdon is a hero in my book and gives hope not all is lost in our struggle to save our country from these invading Mestizo Hordes. The pressure and taunting she likely received from these militant reconquistas to concede must have been substantial.</p>

		<p>On a slightly lighter note, I&rsquo;ve seen the Mexican national anthem performed several times before US-Mexico soccer matches and it always makes me laugh. Whereas we place hand over heart palm to chest, Mexicans do it palm to floor with thumb touching chest.

		<p>To the person interested in the Oath of Diversity&hellip; I googled the term and found one at The University of St. Louis. In it you swear to accept people of different persuaions and fight for social justice. I`m guessing that this is close to the one I refused to sign&hellip; I`m sure more colleges have these than just a few.</p>

		<p>This article and accompanying video are horrifying. I always thought that singing a national anthem or reciting a country&rsquo;s oath of allegiance were tantamount to declaring loyalty to that country. Why should American high school students be forced to learn oaths of allegiance of another country? I don&rsquo;t see high school students in northern Washington or other areas close to the US/Canadian border forced to sing &#8220;Oh Canada.&#8221; And I would think that it would be more productive and infinitely more interesting for students to learn more about Canada than Mexico.</p>

<p>1. English as the official language in the whole of the US</p>
<p>2. Spanish language, as an important part of EUROPEAN heritage should be taught in classes, along with French and German - but NOT in such an degrading environment &amp; circumstances.</p>

		<p>I looked up the high school mentioned, and according to the school census, 100% of its 96 students are Hispanic.  That data may be a year or two old, but in any case Brinsdon is probably the only white student there (I&rsquo;m assuming she is white from her non-Spanish surname).</p>
<p>In the Rio Grande Valley region, which is about 85% Hispanic, it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that they would say pladges to the Mexican flag, especially in a Spanish class.  But, honestly, does it matter?  It seems to me that the Rio Grande Valley is a lost cause by now, and it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone that there is a strong loyalty to Mexico in the region.</p>
