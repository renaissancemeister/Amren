<h1><a href="http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=354309">Obama&rsquo;s &#8216;Department of Payback&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thomas Sowell, World Net Daily, October 10, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Those people of good will who want to replace the racism of the past with a post-racial society have too often overlooked the fact that there are others who instead want to put racism under new management, to have reverse discrimination as racial payback for past injustices.</p>
<p>Attorney General Eric Holder became a key figure epitomizing the view that government&rsquo;s role in racial matters was not to be an impartial dispenser of equal justice for all, but to be a racial partisan and an organ of racial payback. He has been too politically savvy to say that in so many words, but his actions have spoken far louder than any words.</p>
<p>The case that first gave the general public a glimpse of Attorney General Holder&rsquo;s views and values was one in which young black thugs outside a voting site in Philadelphia were televised intimidating white voters. When this episode was broadcast, it produced public outrage.</p>
<p>Although the Department of Justice&rsquo;s prosecution of these thugs began in the last days of the Bush administration, and the defendants had offered no legal defense, the case was dropped by the Justice Department after Eric Holder took over. One of the lawyers prosecuting that case resigned in protest.</p>
<p>That lawyer  &mdash;  J. Christian Adams  &mdash;  has now written a book, titled&#8221;Injustice: Exposing the Racial Agenda of the Obama Justice Department.&#8221;It is a thought-provoking book and a shocking book in what it reveals about the inner workings of the Department of Justice&rsquo;s civil rights division.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Moreover, the civil rights division of the Justice Department has turned the same blind eye to similar voter intimidation and corruption of the voting process by other people and other organizations in other cities and states  &mdash;  so long as those being victimized were white and the victimizers were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The widespread, organized and systematic corruption of the voting process revealed by the author of &#8220;Injustice&#8221; is on a scale that can swing not only local but national elections, including the 2012 elections. The Department of Justice under Eric Holder has not only turned a blind eye to blatant evidence of voter fraud, it has actively suppressed those U.S. attorneys in its own ranks who have tried to stop that fraud.s</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is an enormously eye-opening book which makes painfully clear that, where racial issues are concerned, the Department of Justice has become the Department of Payback. A post-racial society is the last thing Holder and Obama are pursuing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Eric Holder has it in for white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is so blatantly obvious I can&rsquo;t help but marvel at the fact that no radio host or politician has addressed the issue and given it the exposure it requires.  Instead they let it go on and on, and I have no doubt it is flourishing right now.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re delighted that they have a &#8220;fast and furious,&#8221; illegal gun operation attempted by Holder and Obama, because they see the pressing need to oust Holder from office before more damage occurs, and they see this illegal gun operation as the hammer they&rsquo;ve been looking for.  But none of them want to raise the issue of vicious anti-white racism endemic in the Department of Justice, although the racial crimes being committed there right now are as bad&hellip;or much greater&hellip;. than selling guns to drug cartels.</p>
<p>Do you remember how the radical liberals in the Senate forced John Ashcroft to raise his right hand and swear he would not let his harmless Christian religion taint anything he might do as AG?</p>
<p>Contrast that with this AG who thumbs his nose at every white in this country by encouraging anti-white racism in his department, theoretically placing them in danger.</p>
<p>Too, strange isn&rsquo;t it how the Democrats want perfection from Republican Christians, yet place no such restrictions on Muslims in government in spite of the fact Muslims are behind terrorism and killings all over the world?  They, in fact, insist that nobody even hints that Islam is a danger or threat to society.  Yet a harmless, reputable potential AG Christian is regarded by then as somekind of threat.</p>
<p>Empires last only a few short years, and this one, like all the others, is reaching it&rsquo;s end.  Thank God for that.</p>

		<p>I am reading the book &#8220;Injustice.&#8221;   The guy who wrote it might even be considered moderately liberal by Amren standards, but even the author was shocked at the blatant bias/racism against whites.  <br>
 <br>
It is not even payback, it is unprovoked.  Most blacks in the Justice Department have known a lifetime of Affirmative Action, and most whites today are accustomed to discrimination by our government and alienation in old neighborhoods.  Whites avoid black neighborhoods and consider it just common sense.  Blacks, however, swaggar into white neighborhoods and assume special treatment and sue if employers in white neighborhoods if they don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>As for crime, we all know the stats and it occurs year after year.  So this isn&rsquo;t payback, this is just racism against whites and the politicians are not sympathetic to blacks, they are fearful of blacks.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s even more troubling than the degree to which Obama and his administration, and his anything-but-Progressive supporters, have been able to sabotage progress towards a post-racial society is the degree to which the mass media has completely neglected to criticize the stagnation in this process. Many feel this amounts to even more than stagnation, but a retrograde backslide into an even more racially segregated and racially polarized society. Somewhere along the way the left gave up on their own vision of utopia. Instead they settled on an unsustainable, indefinite continuation of the status quo as their ultimate goal and rather than criticize this obvious failure, the media at large offered its support.  When exactly did they give up? Was it when they realized equality literally meant equal expectations as well as a literal interpretation of &#8220;equal treatment&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Ahh yes. I&rsquo;m sure Obama&rsquo;s and Holder&rsquo;s mammies would be proud. Oh wait&hellip; Aren&rsquo;t &#8220;dey mamas&#8221; White? Maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t care regardless. But O&rsquo;bama claimed he was Irish a few months ago right? And Holder claimed he was Hispanic by selling those guns across the border to Mexican drug cartels. If only he knew about the wholesale gun crimes being committed by Mexican gangbangers on his &#8220;brothers&#8221; in Cali, maybe he&rsquo;d think differently. Ahh maybe not. He&rsquo;s only out for himself. </p>

<p>Senator Chuck Grassley from the State of Iowa needs all of our support, to get of Eric Holder out.<br>
	<br>
	Senator Chuck Grassley <br>
	Ph. (202) 224-3744<br>
	<br>
	Give Chuck Grassley a call; tell Chuck his doing a good job holding, Eric Holders feet to the fire on the Fast &amp; Furious gun running scandal, tell the Senator we want Holder fired because he can&rsquo;t be trusted in such an important position.   <br>
	<br>
	Chuck Grassley is being harassed and investigated by the Justice Department now because of the indictment against Holder. </p>
<p>So this is our chance call Senator Chuck Grassley, leave a message. and get Holder out. <br>

All we can hope for is to find sympathetic attornies to help file lawsuits when there are clear cases of discrimination. The real kicker would be to get a lawsuit about the so called &#8220;hate crimes laws&#8221; since they are applied inequally they are clearly unconstitutional. </p>

		<p>I doubt any amount of black racist, white-house- ordered rigging or intimidation can keep Obama in office. He&rsquo;s packing his bags now.<br>
But I&rsquo;m sure it will happen; we will see outrageous incidents. We should file lawsuits.<br>
Then, there&rsquo;s the black race war that will start on election night.<br>

		<p>One looks in vain for any convincing evidence that the President has ever moved in his views beyond the indoctrination he received on a daily basis during his childhood from his socially alienated,<br>
schizy mother, Ann Dunham.  There appears to be no known evidence he has ever anywhere indulged before others in reasoned dialogue with someone holding generally opposing views about race.  He seems to know what buttons he can push and what words and emotions he can use, to &#8220;get results&#8221; concerning race as a vote-harvesting  issue.  I can&rsquo;t find any indication that race has ever generally had any personal significance for him beyond its manipulative potential in his brown hands.  A celluloid President?  </p>

Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s NOT an indictment, which is a formal charge of criminal activity, to be heard and considered by a grand jury- after which a ruling as to whether to pursue prosecution- is handed down.<br>
No, this is a more mundane thing. <br>
But hopefully the Lamestream Dinosaur media will cover it well.<br>

		<p>Eric Holder will be gone in a year, or maybe sooner. It depends on how the next set of subpeonas for the gun running scheme work out. And to my fellow voters, Herman Cain?? I&rsquo;ll bet you can guess which presidential candidate he supported in 2008. He&rsquo;s black. And like Eric Holder his agenda is a black agenda. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what he calls himself, CEO, conservative, businessman, republican. Like Eric Holder, Jimmy Obama, and every other black, he&rsquo;s black first, everything else is secondary. Does anyone in this country not see the consequences of affirmative action in the White House? An inexperienced black with no qualifications was elected because of his race. Do we need to go down that road again? How many black twerps would pizza boy put in office?</p>

		<p>I live in Bartlett Illinois, which is a small town. When I went to vote there were two members of the New Black Panthers standing infront of the doors of the church that is used as a polling place. They each had police batons, and they were intimidating whites going into the building to vote. I suspect that this will happen in the 2012 election. In which case I will be there with my sword protecting my white kinsmen. </p>

		<p>Holders parents came from Barbados, which is ruled by a light-skinned elite. They avoid dark-skinners like the plague. No doubt his kids, like Obama&rsquo;s, went nowhere near black schools. Holder views himself as some sort of nobility. In a black world he would be the elite ruling over the benighted blacks; here,he is the Avenging Hero bravely battling Whitey for &#8220;my people&#8221;. He is an arrogant, vain,loud-mouthed self-centered braggart, a clown, a buffoon. He is truly a despicable son of affirmative action, proving what a vile and contemptuous thing that practice is. I demand justice for, well, Justice. And never again,a &#8220;minority&#8221; as AG,they have proven over and over that they&rsquo;re unfit for the job. Remember Alberto &#8220;Speedy&#8221;Gonzales? The Boy from Texas bragged about how wonderful it was to appoint a real live Mexican as AG. Rush Limbaugh and all of his bretheren got into the act, beaming with pride. This shows, they chirped, how good Republicans are,they appointed the FIRST Latino!! He turned out to be a dumb clod, who was laughed out of town. Harriet Meyers redux. But before he left, he viciously attacked White firemen in NYC, bringing a lawsuit against NY to enable mass discrimination against white men. But Holder, he wont be laughed out of town. Not with blood on his hands.</p>

		<p>Obama&rsquo;s proof positive that the old saw &#8220;anybody can become president&#8221; is indeed true.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that a man who sprang from the loins of a deeply disturbed mother, impregnated by a substance-abusing black African with a whole stable full of other illegitimate offspring, who&rsquo;s never held a real job of any kind, and from whose lips came such utterly meaningless slogans as the audacity of hope (what&rsquo;s audacious about hope?) and we are the ones we&rsquo;ve been waiting for, could be elected to town councilman in a village of 400 souls, let alone the presidency of the US? </p>
<p>In addition to a hopelessly uninformed electorate, we have a voter fraud problem of monstrous proportions, and the Republicans are too cowardly to address it.</p>

<p>Be sure to bring a cell phone with a video app.  If you see any black thugs, be very discreet when filming.</p>
<p>This is something all Whites can do.  As soon as you get home post it on you tube or one of the numerous Republican party neo con websites like freerepublic.  Send the videos to the Republican party headquarters. Send them to Fox news.  Fox might not be much, but at least they are Republicans and not the party of Obama and Holder.<br>

<p>This happened across the Country, but I am also familiar with an incident in Philly, too. This is an outrage. </p>
