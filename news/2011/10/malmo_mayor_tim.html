<h1><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/36606/20111007/">Malmö Mayor: Time to Try &#8216;Temporary&rsquo; Citizenship</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local, October 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Social Democrat Malmö mayor Ilmar Reepalu&rsquo;s proposal to combat criminality by deporting new Swedish citizens who commit serious crimes has been slammed by party colleagues as &#8220;pure racism&#8221;.<br>
	<br>
On Friday, Reepalu suggested deporting criminals and introducing &#8216;temporary&rsquo; citizenship as ways to help combat crime in Malmö in the wake of continuing problems in the city&rsquo;s Seved district-</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe this should be applied more often; that more active criminals who are not Swedish citizens should be deported,&#8221; said Reepalu to the Sydsvenskan newspaper.</p>
<p>During the spring, the problems in Seved grew more extreme and a massive police surveillance programme was initiated. But lately the problems have returned.</p>
<p>Postal workers in the area now carry a personal alarm and many residents say they don&rsquo;t dare go out at night. </p>
<p>A gang of young men has been identified as responsible for the violence and disruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot have a society where children who are struggling in school see these young men leading a criminal lifestyle and controlling the whole area just because everyone is afraid of them,&#8221; said Reepalu.</p>
<p>With the high police presence in the area during spring, crime decreased by 25 percent. </p>
<p>Now Reepalu is calling for a larger effort by the police. </p>
<p>According to police superintendent Henrik Stiernblad, police presence is already high although he told TT that there are plans to increase it even further. </p>
<p>&#8220;We must acknowledge the fact that there are individuals in the area who believe they can commit a crime without any repercussions,&#8221; he told Sydsvenskan.</p>
<p>Reepalu also wants to introduce a type of temporary citizenship for new immigrants as a way to curb crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;A model where it is relatively quick to gain Swedish citizenship, but which entails a few years&rsquo; probationary period in which someone who commits a serious crime doesn&rsquo;t yet have protection against deportation,&#8221; Reepalu told the TT news agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems many of the serious criminal gangs come here and keep a relatively low profile until they get their citizenship. Then, once established here in Sweden, they develop a platform for international criminal activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reepalu said that apparently jail time given for these serious crimes is not enough to deter criminals. </p>
<p>&#8220;According to those I have spoken to, the only real threat in this situation is deportation. And it is clear that we cannot do that today within the rules for Swedish citizenship, where all Swedish citizens are equal,&#8221; he told Sydsvenskan.</p>
<p>When asked whether the temporary citizenship amounted to some form of second-class citizenship, Reepalu said that immigrants are already treated differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a second class citizen before you get Swedish citizenship and today there is a rather long period of time before that.&#8221; </p>
<p>Reepalu initially received support from Social Democrat judicial policy spokesperson Morgan Johansson.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a measure worth trying. And it is of course linked with faster processing times,&#8221; he told the TT news agency.</p>
<p>However, prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt quickly dismissed the idea of having different &#8220;levels&#8221; of citizenship.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have proposed many ways to to tighten the penalties for serious crimes regardless of who the perpetrator is. The frustration in Sweden is that there are far too many crimes not leading to prosecution. But that should not get mixed up with citizenship, which can not be divided up into sections or subcategories,&#8221; said Reinfeldt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either you&rsquo;re a citizen or you&rsquo;re not,&#8221; </p>
<p>Linus Bylund, press secretary to Jimmie Åkesson, head of the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, told news agency TT that his party has been making a similar proposal for years. </p>
<p>The Sweden Democrats now applaud the Social Democrats for embracing this initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;They called us ugly names for this yesterday, but today they stand behind it as their own proposal,&#8221; Bylund told TT. </p>
<p>Later on Friday, however, Social Democrat party leader Håkan Juholt distanced himself from Reepalu&rsquo;s proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;The solution to gang criminality isn&rsquo;t temporary or second-class citizenship. Let me be clear on this point,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mariam Osman, a member of the Social Democrat&rsquo;s governing board, also slammed the Malmö mayor&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;This smells like pure racism,&#8221; she told TT.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t have have people divided into two categories.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sweden will only increase its political infighting via any sort of program for immigration.  If they already wait quietly until they have citizenship, they will wait quietly through any probation.  Sweden has to learn that non-Swedes will never assimilate, become Swedes, especially if they are not white and from places with religions and cultures (non-Western) that never have had any other aim than establishing its own enclaves and even taking over.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have have people divided into two categories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No?  And why shouldn&rsquo;t a country divide people into two categories:</p>
<p>1. Indigenous population, whose ancestors built their nation and created an atmosphere which makes people want to live there, and</p>
<p>2. Immigrants, who have not yet paid their dues to their new host country, and probably haven&rsquo;t even begun to try to learn the language!</p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t immigrants be given a &#8220;probationary period &#8221; of five, or even ten years to prove they are good citizens?</p>
<p>What madness is this that, instead, developed nations roll out the welcome mat in such a fashion, with little or no expectation for the newcomer to assimilate! It is no wonder they immigrate with no feeling of obligation to contribute. People just do not value that which they do not earn.</p>
<p>When will White people open their eyes to this Treason being perpetrated by the very governments that should be serving them, first and foremost?<br>

		<p>Temporary citizenship that doesn&rsquo;t include the right to vote and guest-worker visas are the way to go. Serbia has treaties with Russia and China that regulate immigration along those lines. </p>

<p>Well, actually it&rsquo;s not &#8220;pure racism,&#8221; but I&rsquo;ll take it anyway.  &#8220;Pure racism&#8221; (ergo a better idea) would be not to allow black Africans to immigrate legally into Sweden in the first place, and &#8220;purer racism,&#8221; the best idea, is Sweden for Swedes.  But nobody is asking me.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just sad how many White Europeans are so eager to destroy their ancestral homelands. I visited Sweden for three weeks back in 2001, and I remember the Swedes being almost childlike in their naïveté about the dangers of Africans, Muslims and other Third Worlders. </p>
<p>I remember seeing a pack of Somalian loitering around this mall at Stockholm we visited, shooting daggers at all the Swedes who walked by. I remarked to my hosts that the gang-banger Somalians were more than likely up to no good, but in turn got a surprising reprimand by my female (Swedish) friend, saying that the Somalians were just as Swedish as they were and it was wrong for me to stereotype them. That&rsquo;s how foolish many of the Swedish people are.</p>

<p>Its like this: arrive, apply for a permanent residence permit, wait 5 years, apply for citizenship (dual citizenship possible). There is already a probationary period in the system. The problems here are that the darkhead enclaves have grown so large that its possible to live as an illegal inside them, its not uncommon that deported criminals return despited being banned from reentry and that many of these criminals are 2nd generation darkheads born in Sweden with Swedish citizenship. They cant be deported. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sweden Democrats mentioned are not ethnic nationalists, they are firm believers in assimilation of the darkheads, which in practice means a mulattoization of the Swedish population. This is prefectly acceptable because according to them, if the darkheads speak swedish, they are just as Swedish as a Swedish swede. They fully accept and embrace the cultural marxist raceless description of the world. I thus do not see them as having any positive influence on the future of Sweden. This is going to end with guns and fire and nothing less because it has to. The system is just too decadent. </p>
<p>Heres a youtube video from Rasmusgatan in Seved. Notice the prison like structure in the background and its name (LOL). Its now closed.  </p>

<p>But not all is bad. Some of the swedes that live there deserve all the bad and lots more of it, its very educational for them.</p>

<p>Translated: - I never go out at night anymore, although I am an active person. We moved here because we thought it was cosmopolitan and pleasant to live near Möllan (a place know for its diversity). But the dream has turned into a nightmare. How could this happen?</p>
<p>Well well well, liberal vagina man, reality caught up with you. </p>

<p>The REAL Swedes (White) are so foolish as to allow any nonwhite into their nation, but we all know from those living in the USA, how terribly naive the Swedish population really is when it comes to blacks (and all nonwhites). They think there is &#8220;good&#8221; in every race&hellip;and everyone will live happily ever after, if only the Swedes and the rest of us meanie Whites, will just be &#8220;nicer&#8221; to the blacks among them.</p>
