<h1>Cuomo: NY to Translate Forms into Other Languages</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wall Street Journal, October 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered state agencies Thursday to translate documents and provide interpreters in six languages for immigrants seeking public services.</p>
<p>The $1.5 million effort covered by state and federal funds will also provide the translations to illegal immigrants, depending on what services they seek, Cuomo said. Immigrants won&rsquo;t be asked about their federal immigration status.</p>
<p>The project will translate documents and websites from agencies including social services and motor vehicles into Spanish, Chinese, Italian, Russian, French and French Creole. The group New York Lawyers for the Public Interest estimates 2.5 million immigrants in New York require help understanding English. {snip}</p>
<p>Cuomo said state government for too long made immigrants responsible for learning enough English to apply for public services.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s responsibility to figure out how to communicate with the person,&#8221; Cuomo said.</p>

		<p>American readers will notice that the only, the only time the US government ever requires itself to defer to a person, instead of the other way around, is when that deferment involves subversion of the native White, Christian culture.</p>

		<p>Unlike English, American Sign Language is a language with deep roots in the United States.  Translating forms into ASL is a worthy use of tax dollars.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s right in a way - the Government drag all these disparate peoples into the country, so I suppose THEY do have some sort of responsibility to communicate with them, don&rsquo;t they. Thanks for seeling us all out Government&hellip;</p>

<p>Have you ever tried to understand and/or make yourself understood to some IRS &#8220;worker&#8221; on some tax question/dispute?? (and both of you were putatively speaking standard American English)</p>

		<p>Note to Cuomo:  It&rsquo;s the immigrants&rsquo; responsibility to learn English.  Try moving to Mexico and see how well the government accommodates you with English forms and translators.<br>

		<p>This is a gift to the bureaucracy, who will be demanding higher budgets and more staff.</p>
<p>This is a gift to lawyers, who will be sueing on behalf of clients who didn&rsquo;t get their &#8216;rights&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is a gift to wealthy individuals, who will reaps millions of dollars annually providing translation services under contract to government. </p>

		<p>As has always been and will be now, Americans will be footin&rsquo; the bill for this Privilege as these &#8220;people&#8221; are a part of the Fifty Percent who pay no taxes to begin with and lest we ever forget, these same spawn whom pay no taxes, also collect Welfare of some type.</p>
<p>Oh, besides being overrun by non-whites and their Third World Languages, they bring their &#8220;Values&#8221;, &#8220;Beliefs&#8221;, &#8220;Traditions&#8221; and best of all, their Third World Bugs that literally destroy entire crops of food.  How do ya like that?</p>
<p>Oh Yes, I do Believe in Strict Segregation.  I cain&rsquo;t help it but don&rsquo;t blame me, blame Third World Culture and Third World Bugs.</p>

		<p><i>The $1.5 million effort covered by state and federal funds will also provide the translations to illegal immigrants, depending on what services they seek, Cuomo said. Immigrants won&rsquo;t be asked about their federal immigration status.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the money quote.</p>
<p><i>The project will translate documents and websites from agencies including social services and motor vehicles into Spanish, Chinese, Italian, Russian, French and French Creole.</i></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize there were so many cajuns in New York. Well, of course, there&rsquo;s not. Just like there aren&rsquo;t that many native French speakers. There may be a fair number of Italian and Russian speakers. But this is really about appeasing hispanic immigrants. The others are just an after-thought.</p>
<p><i>Cuomo said state government for too long made immigrants responsible for learning enough English to apply for public services.</i></p>
<p>Yes, of course. With a 15 trillion dollar national debt we certainly don&rsquo;t want immigrants to have to wait for their &#8220;public services&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;French Creole&#8221; is actually not even what the Haitians call it.  They call is &#8220;Haitian Creole&#8221; or simply &#8220;Creole&#8221;.  So, dear commenter Fred, it is Haitians that are being accommodated, not Cajuns.  And calling it French Creole is a way of hiding from the rest of the American public what it actually is: a way of dealing with illegal and refugee Haitian immigrants without saying so.  It is true, though, that throwing Italian and Russian in there is for the purpose of looking balanced.</p>
<p>Listen up, everyone.  The foreign visitors or whatever you want to call them have already taken over.  This is by design and is almost solely to keep certain people in power forever.  It has nothing to do with true multiculturalism, in my opinion.  We are being brought down as a country slowly, incrementally, as this is the only way to do it since our old-time Americans, read: pre-WWII, wouldn&rsquo;t have stood for it.  Decades of indoctrination and screams of &#8220;RAAAACIST&#8221; have us where we are.  Sadly,there is no turning back now.  </p>

<p>Curiously, our country managed just fine for two centuries without this idiotic attitude.</p>
