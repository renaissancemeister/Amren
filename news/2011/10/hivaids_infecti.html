<h1>HIV/AIDS Infection Rate Among African American Women Alarmingly High in St. Louis</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KMOV (St. Louis), October 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 5,000 people in the St. Louis region are living with HIV/AIDS. The rate of the disease is especially high among African Americans and African American women. </p>
<p>In 2010, 300 new HIV/AIDS cases came up in the St. Louis area, according to the state health department. Almost two-thirds of those cases were among African Americans. But among women, African Americans accounted for 86 percent of new cases. </p>
<p>Washington University&rsquo;s Tawnya Brown has been dealing with this issue for more than a decade. She says multiple partners complicated the problem, and that many black women have trouble convincing their mates to use protection. </p>

		<p>At least twice in the last dozen years, St. Louis has been the worst city for AIDS, and at least once in that time period, the worst for another STD, either chlamydia or gonorrhea.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t use protection because they&rsquo;re trying to get pregnant by different fathers. More children means more money from welfare.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not surprised.Recently the stats said it was elderly white people showing an increase in new Aides cases due to Viagra use.The Villages in Fl. were a prime example.Black men won&rsquo;t use protection..result more babies, Aides, and STDS..  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a reminder to all those IQ deficient, MTV brainwashed-for-white-racial-genocide young white females who think its &#8216;trendy&rsquo;, &#8216;hip&rsquo;, and &#8216;fashionable&rsquo; to date and hop into bed with black males:  </p>
<p>The reason these overwhelming and staggering numbers of black women have HIV/Aids - is because they have the most amount of sex with those same black males that MTV and the rest of the anti-white, enemy controlled media are trying their level best to get white females to race mix with.   And, in case the light bulb STILL hasn&rsquo;t flicked on over your empty, embarrassingly easy to manipulate heads - let me put it in another, more direct and simpler to understand manner:</p>
<p>The anti-white, enemy controlled mainstream media is fully aware of these soaring HIV/AIDS infection rates in the black community. And, they do their best to play these facts and statistics down and to avoid publicizing them too widely.   And, the reason they do this - is because they WANT the HIV/AIDS rates to spread into the White community, and the best way to make sure this happens - is to continue to push black male-white female inter-racial race mixing.  </p>
<p>Oh, and one last piece of advice for White males.   Never, under any circumstances should any White man allow himself to get involved in a romantic or intimate fashion with any White female who has crossed the line and had relations with a black man at some point in her past.    This is part of the intention of the enemy controlled media when they push race mixing between black men and white women - and becomes the vehicle by which HIV/AIDS spreads from the black community back over to the White community.  </p>
<p>Remember the old adage:  Once she&rsquo;s gone black, we don&rsquo;t want you back.   Adhere to this rule, White men and racially healthy White women.     Bring back the stigma and social outcasting for Whites who race mix - because this is a key aspect of our racial survival.</p>

		<p>After 25-years of intense publicity &#8220;some people&#8221; don&rsquo;t understand about AIDS prevention? Amazing.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-American women in the ST. Louis region are being severly impacted by HIV/AIDS?&#8221;  Well, I am thinking they are being severly impacted by bad behavioral choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many black women have trouble convincing their mates to use protection.&#8221; Well, I am thinking they could tell them: &#8220;No Protection = No Sex&#8221;. Where is the trouble?</p>
<p>So confusing, I just can&rsquo;t find the logic in this type of PC reporting. It make sit sound like these women are helpless victims who need &#8220;free&#8221; tests and &#8220;free&#8221; treatment when what they really real need are values, morals and being held accountable for their choices.</p>
