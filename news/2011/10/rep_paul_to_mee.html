			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Strauss, The Hill, October 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The leader of a French far-right anti-immigration political party plans to sit down with Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) next month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Madame Le Pen has requested a meeting and Congressman Paul has agreed to a meeting, if he is in town, and as of today it looks like he will be,&#8221; Paul Communications Director Rachel Mills said in an email to AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congressman Paul is also open to meeting with any of the other candidates, it should be noted,&#8221; Mills added.</p>
<p>Le Pen is the daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen who founded the National Front Party and ran as its presidential candidate in the French elections. In April,The New York Times ran a profile of Le Pen and reported that under her leadership, the National Front Party has been reinvigorated and polls &#8220;show her matching or outpacing&#8221; President Nicolas Sarkozy. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The French politician also praised Paul as &#8220;a great defender of an international monetary system anchored on the gold standard,&#8221; according to AFP.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s official  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m back on board the Ron Paul train.  I have been saying all along that I would vote Bachmann, except two things have happened:  First, it is perfectly obvious now, especially to those that watched the debate a few days ago, that Romney and Bachmann are doing restrictor plate racing.  Or, to put it in the WaPo&rsquo;s terms, Romney is weaponizing Bachmann to take out the Rickroller.  The QPQ would be either a cabinet position or President Romney twisting Boehner&rsquo;s arm to step down as Speaker and let her become the next Speaker of the House.  If Bachmann is only staying in this race to help Romney, then I can&rsquo;t take her very reasonable immigration record and statements seriously, if all it will do is accrue to the benefit of an open borders type like Romney.  (And believe me, Romney is open borders  &mdash;  Don&rsquo;t let his anti-Rickroller rhetoric fool you.)</p>
<p>Second, is this news.  Ron Paul is practically the first elected American Republican Party office holder to acknowledge that the Front National and the Le Pen family even exists.  In 2002, when J-M made the runoff, nary a word from Bush, Rush, etc., even though in line item terms, American lamestream conservatives and their apparent agenda are closer to J-M&rsquo;s (and now Marine&rsquo;s) worldview than they are to French lamestream conservatives of the Sarkozy/Chirac mold.</p>
<p>Somehow, I bet the number of other &ldquo;willing Republican Presidential candidates&rdquo; who will want to be seen with her will number exactly zero.</p>

		<p>How to Stop Immigration - Part 1</p>
<p>Send a letter, email, postcard,  etc to your elected representative (Congressman, Senator, Member of Parliament etc.) informing him/her that if he/she does not support a zero immigration policy that you will vote against him no matter what. Come election day, you vote against that person even if you have to hold your nose to do so.</p>
<p>Most electoral districts have a narrow margin between the winner and loser. Politicians are cowards, if enough people send such messages they will get scared and act on this serious issue.</p>

		<p>People here like to criticize Paul for being weak on immigration. But even Tancredo wouldn&rsquo;t meet with someone like Le Pen. And here in New Hampshire where I&rsquo;m presently staying Paul is running TV ads saying that he is opposed to birthright citizenship for the children of illegals. Have Romney, Bachmann or the others said in point blank language that they favor the same? i don&rsquo;t think so. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m disgusted that a man like Ron Paul can only get 10% of the entire GOP behind him while they fight over Cain, Romney and that huckster Perry. 1/10 ain&rsquo;t bad for now but American conservatives as a group have a long way to go before enlightenement. I give them 15 years if Obama gets a 2nd term.</p>

		<p>Jean-Marie Le Pen is correct.</p>
<p>	Ron Paul is the only candidate that with a real tax plan, he seeks to end the income tax, and the corrupted Federal Reserve System. [Fact] America had no income tax or estate taxes until 1913 and our economy was thriving, of course News media will denounce anyone that is willing to cut federal spending, an put an end to the [Federal Reserve] and the [Wall Street Bankers] monopoly to creating money from nothing and charging interest to the taxpayers on the money they created. [Fact] Herman Cain sat on the board of directors for the [Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City] from 1995 to 1996. Herman Cain is attempting to dupe the nation, with his 999.</p>

		<p>The insinuation is that something is evil about Ron Paul. He could be hiding pro-white allegiance because he is meeting with the French nationalist. Which just begs the question: Name the most prominent person, active in public life, who proudly proclaims a white identity. Congress? Hollywood? Ivy League? Wall Street? Sports? Publishing? </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do it can you? The exclusion of white identity from public life is total. </p>

		<p>When &#8216;Sarky&rsquo; (Sarkozy) delivered his famous &#8216;metissage&rsquo; message (that all European/Western Whites should mulatto-ize themselves out of existence) I thought that France and the World would rise up to denounce him. </p>
<p>That they didn&rsquo;t do more than &#8216;peep&rsquo; angered me. But then, Ms. LePen began to eat at his shadow, and now has him running scared that he WILL lose to her, in the next Elections in France.</p>
<p>Ms. Le Pen is showing allegiance to the spirit of America, and the better part of the Spirit of the French Revolution (the guillotine and the anarchy was clearly pre-Marxist marxism, and Illuminism, by the same &#8216;international banker&rsquo; crowd) in wishing to even speak with Rep. Dr. Paul.</p>
<p>Rep. Paul is doing EXACTLY what &#8216;candidate Obama&rsquo; did when he visited Berlin BEFORE he was &#8216;crowned king.&rsquo; I consider this to be something to make the IB crowd in NYC and the Media urinate their pants, for they see (like Satan) &#8216;that their time is short.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bravo, Ron Paul. Tres Bien, Mme. Le Pen! </p>

		<p>Looks like Rep. Paul has got his mojo back.  About time, too.  Back in the Nineties Paul wouldn&rsquo;t have hestitated for a minute  to meet with Le Pen or her father.  Unfortunately, his contempt for all things related to the State after 9/11 became his default setting, causing him to oppose even moderate border and interior immigration control measures.</p>
<p>I may vote for this guy after all.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m another enthusiastic Ron Paul supporter. However, I&rsquo;d like to see him get his rating for his stance on immigration improved. This is currently an F according to Numbers USA. A previous commentator mentioned Mitt Romney&rsquo;s pro open borders stance. Ironically Mitt Romney&rsquo;s rating according to Numbers USA is a C- behind Michele Bachmann&rsquo;s B-.</p>

		<p>It cannot be said too often: Ron Paul will never explicitly support AR positions. BUT, as a strict constitutionalist, he would end the welfare gravy train  &mdash;  food stamps, Medicaid, etc  &mdash;  that illegals &amp; their anchor babies love. So while he may not come out &amp; join us, his limited government principals would have the net effect of discouraging leech-immigration. AR posters should keep their eye on the ball &amp; not worry about candidates who just talk a good game. Ron Paul would make America safer for whites even if he can&rsquo;t say it.</p>

<p>So we punish poor Whites who REALLY do need food stamps and medicare? Most of whom has worked and paid the taxes to begin with? Just because of these nonwhite parasites, we will all have to suffer? Whites have paid the majority of the taxes and we all know it, yet most of those taxes went to support the nonwhites in this country.</p>
<p> I am for denying any government aid for all nonwhites and let them live off charity from all their rich/middle class blacks and browns. Such as Oprah, Obama, sports stars, rap stars, black/brown congressmen, movie stars and so on. I am sure Bono will donate his &#8220;talent&#8221; to such an &#8220;aid&#8221; concert. I am sure all those people will love to donate to their own brothers and sisters without Whitey&rsquo;s help, right?  </p>

		<p>He sounds like a good candidate to me, from what I&rsquo;ve heard.  Especially when you consider the fact that, although libertarians often aren&rsquo;t very hard on immigration, the libertarian ideology definately has the potential to became fiercely anti-immigration.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s great that big bank Credit Suisse have been fined for their wrongdoings - but why hasn&rsquo;t anyone gone to jail? A bank is a financial institution so fining them means nothing; they can get the fine back in many ways from their clients. Imprison them and it&rsquo;ll actually hurt them. We need to see punishment that means something to the banks, for all our sakes. </p>
