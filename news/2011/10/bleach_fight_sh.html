<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Saturday morning of shopping turned into an emergency hazmat situation at a Baltimore Walmart where two patrons threw bleach and disinfectant at one another, officials said.</p>
<p>Baltimore County Police responded to a call at about 10:48 a.m. Saturday and found two women fighting inside the store.</p>
<p>The bleach and disinfectant created toxic fumes, forcing the immediate evacuation of the entire Arbutus store, officials told ABC News affiliate ABC 2. It closed for several hours.</p>
<p>Fire, EMS and hazardous materials units were dispatched to the scene, as well as 10 medics.</p>
<p>Nineteen people reportedly received treatment, including three Walmart employees. {snip}</p>
<p>Three Walmart employees were being treated for respiratory problems, a Walmart spokeswoman told ABC News.</p>
<p>Police have arrested Theresa Monique Jefferson, 33, after she turned herself in to authorities, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The brawl was a result of an ongoing dispute between Jefferson and the victim because the victim&rsquo;s boyfriend is the father of Jefferson&rsquo;s child, according to the AP.</p>

		<p>Is anyone else as tired as I am of seeing that &#8220;I be BADDD,&#8221; high self-esteem/low IQ stare on every black female mug shot? It&rsquo;s often said that insecure people put up a brave front to mask their inadequacies, but I don&rsquo;t believe blacks are capable of thinking that abstractly. The face simply reflects who they are.</p>

		<p>What savagery.  I live in an area where the wal-marts, as the liberal whack-jobs might say, severely lack diversity.  This type of incident has not, does not, and will not happen.  Ever.  Well, at least until they get &#8220;diversity,&#8221; then who knows.  Probably will happen.  </p>
<p>The bleach must have been the handiest weapon available.  They didn&rsquo;t say, &#8220;I&rsquo;ma find some bleach to throw at choo!&#8221; </p>
<p>What would&rsquo;ve happened if they were in the housewares section?  How many innocents would have been slashed open by cheap kitchen cutlery?   </p>

1. Ban her from Wal-mart for life.<br>
2. Jail time for assault<br>
3. Fine her for costing Wal-mart money, because they had to close their business early that day.</p>

		<p>It would seem as if the Walmart employees (and I&rsquo;m giving them the benefit of the doubt) attempted a clean-up and weren&rsquo;t aware that bleach mixed with almost anything else results in highly-toxic gas flooding the immediate area. It&rsquo;s not just unpleasant, it can be deadly-even out of doors. </p>
<p>  I&rsquo;ve noticed the &#8220;look&#8221; too, General. There&rsquo;s nothing in these faces, not a thing behind the eyes. Maybe the mugshot should have been taken with some of the mess the woman left behind sitting under her nose.</p>

		<p>We saw this story on Fox news. They talked about two women having a brawl in Walmart, and would have more after the commercial break. I told my hubby I&rsquo;d bet him it was black women and if I was right, he would do the dinner dishes. He wouldn&rsquo;t bite. Eh&hellip; can&rsquo;t blame me for trying.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s just another reason reinforcing my decision to avoid WalMart.  In Western Washington we have local big box stores with loyal clientele that predate Wally World so when they expanded into the area they became the exclusive haunt of feral blacks and recent immigrants who haven&rsquo;t learned about Costco yet.  </p>
<p>It smells, the parking lot is full of taxi cabs, and you&rsquo;ll hear just about every language imaginable save English.  No thanks, I&rsquo;ll stick with Fred Meyer even though it&rsquo;s more expensive.  At least the trash there is white.</p>

		<p>When I came across this story yesterday my first thought was &#8220;Walmart must have run out of orange soda.&#8221; I knew at least one of the instigators was black without even having a mug shot or a name. I must be psychic! </p>
<p>I wonder why black women get so bent out of shape when their men cheat on them? Every time I see a black family&rsquo;s profile at my insurance gig it never fails that the four kids have three different surnames. This is the modus operandi of the black man and there is no reason for the black women to fight about it! </p>

		<p>Wherever blacks go there is assaults and violence. It is in their genes, period. In black neighborhoods most stores closed down simply because blacks still do not know how to act and behave in a civilized manner. How long have they been here?  Hundreds of years? And some people still think blacks can change if they just lived around us..no matter the evidence to just the opposite.</p>

I bet the people from the days of slavery would not believe that we have allowed and HEPPED these people become our rulers.<br>
What we can say, how we can walk, how we can gaze upon them is all under their control and they are pushing that to the limit.<br>

		<p>You guys need to lighten up! Why isn&rsquo;t my local Walmart this fun?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t a bleach fight called a &#8220;Michael Jackson?&#8221;</p>
<p>These are Holder&rsquo;s people and Øbama voters. Now they are white oppressors!</p>
<p>For Walmart&rsquo;s part, &#8220;this is obviously not the type of behavior we would expect from people at our stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, normal Walmart behavior is stampedes, beating up on greeters and massive theft.</p>

		<p>Retail stores with items on shelves are not for blacks. Blacks are psychologically incapable of handling that much freedom. See it now, want it now, grab it now is all that matters to them.</p>
<p>Now bleach will be kept in locked wire cages behind the counter and the price of everything will rise slightly because the blacks need babysitting like this to prevent impromptu bleach fights. </p>
<p>Because blacks lack self-control, eventually everything must be kept behind bars, to keep them from trashing it and hurting themselves and others.</p>

		<p>This to &#8220;General Quagmyer&#8221;.  You comment on that &#8220;look&#8221; .  The other place that particular &#8220;look&#8221; can be seen is in the parking lots when they walk right down the center of the lanes, blocking cars and just daring you to hit them.  Same look can be found as black people cross streets, especially when they (commonly) do not use established cross-walks.</p>

		<p>That look the previous posters were talking about is real. I have been lucky enough to be enriched with diversity for a lot of my younger years, and I speak from experience when I tell you that when you are forced to deal with a black and they get a look like that in their eyes hit them first. Your average respectable white citizen would be shocked by the savagery and senseless violence that some of these individuals are capable of. </p>

		<p>As for locking items on the shelves, I noticed many years ago it was tobacco, then a few years later it was razors (the blades AND the actual shavers).  Then, it became electric razors and electric toothbrushes.  But the latest really gets my goat: body wash.  Really?  Body wash?  I&rsquo;ve seen them locked up in a plexiglass display but only at the ghetto grocery stores I am forced, for the most part, to shop from because I live in a ghetto neighborhood out of financial necessity.  Someday I will ask the store manager why BODY WASH is locked up.  It&rsquo;s just weird!</p>

		<p>What were black women doing in the home-cleaning products section anyway? From the looks of most of the dumps they live in, they don&rsquo;t ever buy or use these products. My sister and I used to earn money cleaning apartments between tenants, back when we were in college. The filth, disrepair and outright vandalism in some of them was almost unimaginable. I suppose when you live with people who think nothing of beating another person senseless for an imagined  slur, a cabinet door wrenched off it&rsquo;s hinges, or a vinyl floor that the dirt has to be chiseled off isn&rsquo;t too upsetting&hellip;  </p>

Peejay, common household bleach mixed with ammonia produces chlorine gas, a poisonous gas that can be fatal. I&rsquo;m only surprised that there weren&rsquo;t more victims.</p>

<p>Just drive down the street normally, until one or more of these geniuses starts to &#8220;J walk&#8221; across the street, taking their sweet time about it. </p>
<p>After a grace period of about 30 seconds, lay into your Air Horn and watch these Magic Johnson wannabes become Air borne, themselves. It really shakes things up, and gets them moving. </p>
