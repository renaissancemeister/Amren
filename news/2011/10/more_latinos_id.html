<h1>More Latinos Identify as Native American, Census Shows</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laurie Guthmann, CNN, September 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Ana María Tekina-eirú Maynard filled out her census form last year, she checked the box for Latino, and for the first time, she also checked the box for Native American.</p>
<p>It had taken her more than 30 years  &mdash;  plus research and genetic testing  &mdash;  to discover her ties to the indigenous Taínos of Puerto Rico, to claim her identity and re-learn what she thought she knew of her history.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not the only one. Since 2000, the number of Hispanics who identified themselves as Native American grew from 407,073 to 685,150, according to the 2010 census.</p>
<p>Some attribute the increase to immigration from parts of North and South America where there are large indigenous populations. In some cases, it&rsquo;s because of recently discovered ties to native cultures.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Four years ago, Maynard heard about the work of Dr. Juan Carlos Martinez Cruzado, a geneticist from the University of Puerto Rico. In an island-wide genetic study, he found that at least 61.1% of those surveyed had mitochondrial DNA of indigenous origin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mario Garza created the Indigenous Cultures Institute in 2005, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the research and preservation of indigenous cultures. It tries to educate people with indigenous roots who label themselves &#8220;Hispanic,&#8221; Garza said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Spaniards tried to destroy our civilization and history, outlawed our ceremonies, yet we are still here,&#8221; Garza said. &#8220;With a bigger group of Native Americans, we have a better chance of getting federal recognition and grants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maybe, but they should be asking the government of Mexico for such recognition and grants, not the U.S.  And of course, getting free money and other goodies is what this new drive for Amerinds recognition is what it is all about.  If greater advantage could be had via Hispanic identity, they would be building it up.  They sense a new scam, a new, even better way.  Imagine the new demands for reservation land, gambling casino applications, etc.  They may be of lower IQ than whites, but they sure can see a sucker for grafting.</p>

		<p>The agenda behind Amren&rsquo;s subtitle of this article(&#8220;As they should&#8221;) reeks of intellectual dishonesty. The frequency of Europoid, Amerindian and Sub-Saharan African genetic admixture in Latin Americans varies on a country-to-country basis(and on a region-to-region basis within a country i.e Sonora, Mexico having the highest European admixture and Veracruz, Mexico having the highest African admixture and Guererro, Mexico having the highest Indigenous admixture.) Puerto Ricans have some of the highest Black admixture, Mexicans have some of the lowest. Therefore, asserting that &#8220;Latinos&#8221; should identify as Native American is inaccurate, given the fact that Mestizo Mexicans(who constitute 80% of the population) are between 41.8%-58.96% Caucasoid. Asserting that Puerto Ricans should identify as Native presents an even worse problem, from a genetic standpoint, given the fact that the Taino were effectively extinct by the 16th century(90% killed). And Boriquas, today, only possess mtDNA markers of Taino, due to Spaniard men intermixing with aboriginal women. Latinos are, mostly, of mixed race.</p>

		<p>So Garza&rsquo;s purpose is to &#8220;have a better chance of getting federal recognition and grants.&#8221;  Translation:  a better chance of dipping their greedy entitlement beaks into the redistribution pool filled with the hard-earned dollars of the American taxpayer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m a &#8220;racist&#8221; because I squawk at being forced to help fill the pool, I enjoy my white heritage, and I am not interested in laying down for the genocide of my people.</p>

		<p>I miss the good old days when I first came to America and they called them &#8216;Indians&rsquo;. As an immigrant from India, I was hoping that I&rsquo;d eventually qualify for the same government goodies that they did just because I shared the same name with them.</p>

<p>In other words, they want more free goodies courtesy of the white taxpayer.  I don&rsquo;t see how indigenous immigrants from Latin American countries have any right to claim to be &#8216;Native American&rsquo; when that should only apply to people with Indian ancestry of tribes that resided in the United States.  But leave it to our ridiculous racial bean counting government to give out double rewards for being in the preferred &#8216;victim&rsquo; class.  The lunacy that preferential treatment for whites is morally unacceptable yet preferential treatment for all non-whites is acceptable always boggles the mind.  It defies simple logic and shows that these leftists and neo-con Republicans are the enemy of all whites.  </p>

		<p>Given how only about 9% or so of Mexico&rsquo;s population are White people of Spanish descent, and how those people, as well as the Mestizos who are mostly of Spanish descent are the ones staying in Mexico, it&rsquo;s obvious the Mexicans who move to the US are those of Native American descent more or less. (The Mestizos that want to come to the US seem to have higher amounts of Native American admixture than other Mestizos.)</p>

		<p>The native population of Mexico, Central and South America are not of the same gene pool as the redman of North America.  What is called Hispanics of today was originally an amalgamation of blue (extinct), orange (extinct), yellow, and red races.  (There were originally six colored races based on the color of the rainbow).  This amalgamation produced a new race until discovered by white explorers.  But prior to the white explorers, few descendants of Adam and Eve (they traveled everywhere on this planet) did land in South America.  They built the ziggurats, flat pyramids and Machu Picchu.  These pyramids look similar to the ones in the Middle East.  The second Garden of Eden was between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq.      </p>

		<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Rob. The motive is to claim that they have a right to this continent and we do not, according to them. In fact, if you look at some of the videos of Brown Berets yelling obscenities, threats, and challenges at Anglo-Americans, they constantly claim that they have a right to be here and we do not and that we should die off or be killed off (yes, they do say this). </p>
<p>The percentages of Indian and Spanish heritage for Mexico are on record. Out of memory I think that it is something like, 80% Mestizo (which for any individual could be 90% Spanish and 10% Indian or vice versa), 12% Indian, and 8% Spanish. However, certain regions have a lot of Spanish people. For example, Chihuahua. Sure, there are some Tarahumara Indians (mountain Indians) in Chihuahua but there are hardly any other Indians in Northern Mexico as compared to other regions.</p>
<p>How about Ricardo Mantalban, how Indian is he? Hardly. How about almost every millionaire and billionaire in Mexico? How about most of the upper level government officials in Mexico? Hardly Indian, probably not at all. How about most of the Mexican TV and Movie stars, a bunch of Spaniards.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, they do not have any claim to this land, Indian or not! Let them take Mexico back from the Spaniards that control it! They are afraid to do so. They refuse to straighten out the corrupt and unjust Mexican government. They don&rsquo;t think that we are capable or willing to fight for our rights. They are wrong. In fact, I have a solution!</p>
<p>Here is kind of a Solomon&rsquo;s solution. If the standard is indigenous American ancestry, then only the Indian part of those mestizos stays here, the other part is shipped back to Spain. This is tongue in cheek to make a point, I am not advocating atrocities and besides you would have to splice all of the cells and DNA! </p>
<p>How about the millions of Americans who have Indian blood but appear to be white because they are descended from tall blond and ruffous Europeans and tall lanky (compared to stocky Central American Indians) Indians from the U.S. The mixture looks different and is not as obvious. Central American Indians have stocky physiques and more delicate facial features and are darker, U.S. Indians tend to be tall and somewhat slender but with rugged facial architecture. Darker Europeans of Mediterranean type mixed with the Indians of Mexico.</p>
<p>Take Chuck Norris, half Cherokee, half Irish. Are the Brown Berets going to let him stay? I bet he could knock several of them out or such before they remove him:) </p>
<p>Again, they do not think that we are capable of resisting (partly because of the effite self-hating white ethno-masochists).  I think that those Mexicans need to take a stroll through North and South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, etc. and take a look at the people that they think will stand down and allow their people to be killed or deported.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Rational Observationist&#8221;  It is your agenda that reeks, not AR&rsquo;s. AR is a site about and for White, Caucasion&hellip;wholely Caucasian peoples. What percentage of this, that, and the other thing various Amerinds and &#8220;Latinos&#8221; may or may not have in their genetics is perhaps interesting on some academic level - but not really inportant. Alas, they are NOT WHITE. Quibbling over the percentages of Non-Whiteness is not the point, and not the &#8220;agenda&#8221; you seem to claim AR has. </p>
<p>You will notice we also consider Mulattos, like our president to be Black, despite his oft forgotten White anscestry. Same is true for Mestizos, etc. </p>

		<p>They may have some Amerindian ancestry which, I suppose, makes them &#8220;native american&#8221;. But if their Amerindian ancestors came from Central America then they weren&rsquo;t native to North America. Therefore, they should receive neither citizenship nor privileges simply because North, South and Central America happen to share the word &#8220;America&#8221; in their names. </p>
<p>We really need to cut this &#8220;gravy train&#8221; crap out. It seems like everyone is competing to see how much they can steal from the taxpayers. And its happening at every single level from the fat cats on Wall Street to the indigent. No wonder the US is broke.</p>

		<p>There Jared Taylor goes again. </p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t AMREN use intelligence and truth to come down on this mindwash? </p>
<p>Native American? </p>
<p>How can they be native American when they are not even native and sure as heck not American? </p>
<p>These red mongoloids came from Asia and even pc archaeologists acknowledge they crossed the northwest Bering Strait land bridge that wasnt even named Bering Strait 1500 yrs ago. </p>
<p>America was not named America until 1512 after white European Italian Amerigo Vespucci who made headlines saying the white man had not landed in Asia but in a new western hemisphere. <br>
He died in 1512 and the western hemisphere was named America.</p>
<p>Unless these red mongoloids are from Europe originally they are NOT native Americans. </p>
<p>REAL native Americans are white Europeans from all nations only.</p>
<p>Come on AMREN. Education of the masses is what you need to be performing not keeping with the brainwash lies of the pc liberal devils.</p>

<p>You are exactly right Rob. La Raza supporters speak of North America as the &#8220;Bronze Continent.&#8221; For these Mexican/Central American irredentists, all of North America belongs to the descendants of the Aztecs and Mayas. They are not the ancestors of the indigenous people of North America  &mdash;  that is a lie! They have no claim to land settled and developed by whites, or Native Americans for that matter, in North America.</p>

		<p>Actually, virtually all of us, Americans, who are colonial descendants, are also part Indian.  For the first 150 years of immigration, about four men came over for every woman, so the excess men took Indian wives and raised their children as Europeans.  If you study family history and find out that one of your prerevolutionary ancestors, Mr. John Wilkins, married a Miss Lydia Skunk, chances are that Liddy was Indian.</p>

		<p>These people are from the part of North America called Central America and they are partly white. North America goes all the way to the Panama Canal, learn your geography, people. I agree however, that Mexican Indians and Mestizos have no claim to the United States for several reasons.</p>
<p>This point about almost all of them being partly Caucasian is made to undermine their own argument and does not have anything to do with a rigid dogma of who is white (and many do not understand what the correct use of the term is or the nature of the &#8220;white&#8221; family tree). It is to point out the weakness of their (the Mexicans) argument. I am accepting, just for the sake of argument, the highly questionable premise that native American blood is all that entitles you to be here. It is a weak argument even if you accept the ridiculous premise. For one  thing many of the mostly whites of the U.S., are a little bit Indian and their ancestors have been here for a long time. For another, I do not accept that you have to have indigenous ancestry to live here or that it entitles you to it (not to mention the fact that Caucasians seem to have been here first or concurrently with Mongoloids, for example Kennewick Man et. al.). If you listen to many of the the Indigenous origin myths, they speak of white people emerging from caves with them and parting ways at the earliest of times).</p>
<p>Unless you have 100% Nordic ancestry, most of you will not make the cut that is advocated by some, anyway. Even many of you &#8220;Nordics&#8221; have a whole lot of Alpine type or other types whether you know it or not. A lot of Germans, for example, are round-headed, stocky, brunette, Alpines, not Nordic. Those who do are pure are probably very recent immigrants. It does make a difference and you probably do not have much practice of being an American and much family tradition of being an American if you are relatively recent (last 100 to 160 years). This country has very rapidly eroded American principles and culture in the last 160 years. If your family was here during the revolution, you should have a lot of understanding and family traditions of what it means to be an American.</p>
<p>Besides, if you start quibbling about how &#8220;white&#8221; you are, then who are the best whites and how much of that do you really have? Some might favor the Nordics but many others might point out how excellent the cro-magnon type (which still exists) is. Cro-Magnons might look somewhat Nordic (blond or rufous, long-headed, tall, often blue-eyed) but they are different and have a huge brain. I think that anyone who starts trying to hype this absolute purity ideal had best learn more physical anthropology (from the old days when we were allowed to study that and didn&rsquo;t have to answer to the marxists). </p>
<p>This term &#8220;white&#8221; as it is being used by our enemies and by most of us is baby-talk. You need to understand what white really is. The Caucasian (white) race includes many branches, Nordics, Cro-Magnons or &#8220;Cro-Magnoids&#8221; for skeptics, Mediterraneans, Alpines, etc. It was believed by many that the Nordics and Mediterraneans are more recently separated from the same type because their skeletons are quite similar (long headed, relatively slender, tall in the case of Nordics and SOME of the Mediterraneans). Those who hate whites and use the term &#8220;white&#8221; in such an unlearned way, are referring to the Nordic type and they do not even know about the Cro-Magnon type and the Alpine type are. They also do not know that many of the Nordics are part Cro-magnon or part Alpine or both. Millions of the people of India are Caucasians. Arabs and Berbers are Caucassians. What is going on here is that there is a war against the Nordics, Cro-magnons, and Nordic-Alpines. The enemies do not know what they are talking about and most of the &#8220;whites&#8221; themselves do not know what they are talking about. I am with the &#8220;whites&#8221; myself but I think that &#8220;whites&#8221; should learn some physical anthropology so that they know what they are talking about. The attackers of &#8220;whites&#8221; are often the Caucasians (whites) of the Mediterranean, Dinaric, Armenoid, and sometimes Alpine type along with Blacks, some Asians, etc. Some of these people are pretty closely related to us but will not admit it. So be it. Then they are enemies. But know what you are talking about people. Many of Spanish descent consider themselves to be non-white but they are wrong. They are attacking the Nordics. I guess that they have chosen sides but they are white, just a slightly darker shade and a slightly different branch of the Caucasian family. American Italians at least know this. Though they are often largely of Mediterranean and often especially Alpine type, but often also lots of Nordic, they know that they are white and resent being told that they are non-white. They are right.  </p>
<p>As for Oba Mau Mau being half white but being black, he is highly hostile and hateful to whites, identifies as black, and does not qualify to be president because he is a foreigner and his father was a foreigner. Furthermore, blacks are not part of the Caucasian family. Also Asians and American Indians are much more closely related to whites and are very far, despite skin color, from Blacks. Caucassoids and Mongloids are from the same original group which used to be called the circumpolar race. On a biochemical level they share characteristics that they do not share with Blacks. If you look in an older edition of the Encyclopedia Brittanica, you can read about this.</p>
<p>In summary, the Mexicans own argument does not hold up when you accept its premise for the sake of argument. The premise however, is unacceptable. As for the rest, with all due respect, learn what you are talking about and stop talking baby-talk, please.</p>

		<p>Hispanic is not a racial, ethnic, or national group. Hispanic is one who speaks Spanish. Hispanics are white Europeans, black Cubans, brown Phillipinos, and any other number of peoples from all racial groups. Native American describes people from Asia that migrated to the North American continent thousands of years ago. Recent fossil finds suggest that Europeans came to North America thousands of years before any &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; arrived. Migration of people from one place to another does not qualify those people to claim they are native to their new home. A Puerto Rican that is a decendent of indigenous Puerto Rican people is not a Native American. He is a Puerto Rican. Last time I looked Puerto Rico was not in North America or America itself. I am decended from German people, but I am not a German, I am an American. My family immigrated to Pennsylvania from Germany in 1760. In fact, I&rsquo;m more of a Native American than any Puerto Rican. I don&rsquo;t think the indians in Puerto Rico had much knowledge of a place that didn&rsquo;t exist at the time they lived. Puerto Rico was ceded to the U.S. from Spain in 1898. I really wouldn&rsquo;t consider Puerto Ricans Americans or Native Americans, Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in presidential elections. Most historical information on Puerto Rico and the Taino before Columbus is not well known. Puerto Ricans that cannot trace their ancestry to European colonists are actually mulattoes, not Native Americans, no matter what language they speak.</p>

		<p>I think that Native Hawaiians have a greater claim for recognition that these so called native americans. After all, the Native Hawaiians met the the first white settlers in Hawaii and died off because they did not have immunity to diseases brought over by the whites.</p>

<p><i>As an immigrant from India, I was hoping that I&rsquo;d eventually qualify for the same government goodies that they did just because I shared the same name with them.</i></p>
<p>Now we know the real reason you came here:  as a freeloader for government handouts provided by white American taxpayers.</p>
<p>@2  RationalObservationist:</p>
<p><i>The agenda behind Amren&rsquo;s subtitle of this article (&ldquo;As they should&rdquo;) reeks of intellectual dishonesty.</i> </p>
<p>I could not care less what percentage of non-white &#8220;aggrieved&#8221; persons are black, hispanic or native America.  All have low IQ&rsquo;s, high crime rates and demand their &#8220;fair share&#8221; of white taxpayer money for their various grievances against whites.  The only thing I want is non-whites OUT of this country and for third world immigration to stop immediately and permanently.  For whites, nothing else should matter.</p>
<p><i>Come on AMREN. Education of the masses is what you need to be performing not keeping with the brainwash lies of the pc liberal devils.</i> </p>
<p>We whites are under a genocide watch because various non-whites demand our living space and money.  I too resent this article being published on this site and don&rsquo;t see the point. As poster HH points out, why quibble over what percentage of non-whites are non-white. Why would any white concern himself over such trivialities when the larger issue for us is the rise of a massive hostile non-white population that out politicians welcome and that will eventually destroy us.  </p>
<p>All white lands are under threat of non-white take over through massive immigration and large birthrates.  Nothing else should matter to whites but this.</p>
<p>This is what non-whites are screaming (h/t to  Fr. John+ for providing the link):</p>
<p>October 3, 2011:</p>
<p><i>If anyone&rsquo;s going to be deported, it&rsquo;s going to be you! &hellip; Get out! We are the future. You&rsquo;re old and tired. Go on. We have beaten you – leave like beaten rats. You old white people, it is your duty to die. Right now, we&rsquo;re already controlling those elections, whether it&rsquo;s by violence or nonviolence. Through love of having children we&rsquo;re going to take over./i&gt; </i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Augustin Cebada, information minister of Brown Berets, militant para-military soldiers of Aztlan shouting at U.S. citizens at an Independence Day rally in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Their numbers are increasing, people, while ours are shrinking.  This is who will be lording over us, our white children and grandchildren, sooner than you think.  Open your eyes and look around you. Are you OK with what&rsquo;s going on?  NO major politicians represent us.</p>

<p>In your comment you write as if all Hawaiians died many years ago. This goes to show your ignorance of reality.</p>

		<p>Mexican mestizos are not North American Native Americans. The American Journal of Physical Anthropology reports the paternal ancestry estimated in Western and Northern Mexican-Mestizos is mainly European (60-64%), followed by Amerindian (25-21%), and also African (15%) from the great number of African slaves Mexicans imported during the Atlantic slave trade years.</p>
<p>Full blooded Ameri-indians from tribes in Mexico continue to be officially and systematically oppressed by Mexicans in Mexico. Mexican meztisos with some link to a tribe in Mexico have no valid ancestral claim on any land via the tribes here in the USA.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder that anthropologists do not classify Hispanics as Native Americans because they are not Native Americans. They are officially defined as &#8220;a person[s] of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.&#8221; </p>
<p>Complicating the situation is that pre-Columbian tribes here warred into antiquity with the pre-Columbian tribes south of the United States to the extent that their languages, rituals, cultures, etc.. are different. For example, the warrior Aztecs/Mexicas (for whom Mexico named itself upon gaining their independence from Spain) buried each male child&rsquo;s umbilical cord as a pledge they would live the life of a warrior dedicated to killing and enslaving other tribes and were the dominant pre-Columbian indigenous people dominating northern Mexico at the time of the Spanish conquest led by Hernan Cortes in the early 16th century never even got a foothold here due to the fierce resistance of the northerly tribes in what we call today the United States of America. In fact, Mexica/Aztecs were actually much farther south than the current Mexico/United States border and their territory was about the size of Kansas when Hernan Cortes discovered them. </p>
