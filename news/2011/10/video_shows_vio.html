			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS New York, October 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An argument between a cashier and two irate customers at a Manhattan McDonald&rsquo;s turned violent, leaving both customers injured and all three facing charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It appeared to have started when two female customers argued and yelled obscenities at the cashier when he questioned a $50 bill they gave him.</p>
<p>One of the female customers then slapped the cashier. A woman is then seen jumping over the counter while the other woman goes behind the register.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when the cashier can be seen on the video disappearing into the back of the fast-food restaurant. He comes back with a metal rod and begins hitting the women.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One female customer had a fractured skull that required surgery and a broken arm. The other has a deep laceration.</p>

		<p>Everybody here should take the side of that African-American man. I don&rsquo;t care what his past was. When 2 thugs jump over a counter and physically attack someone that person should have a right to beat the thugs with a pole until the thugs lie still on the ground. If it had been 2 white men who behaved like that instead of 2 black women then everyone would have hailed the employee as a hero.</p>

		<p>And yet the guy is being charged  &mdash;  charged for defending himself from physical assault or murder and his place of business from possible robbery!  How can a person know just how far he can go when fighting off attackers?  Is one whack okay?  How about two?  Should he have just kept going out the back and left the place vulnerable to two vicious black women who might well have trashed the place, broken into the cash register, attacked other staff and customers, and burned the building down?  At least he won&rsquo;t be charged with a hate crime.</p>

		<p>I know this McDonalds.  It&rsquo;s right near the &#8220;famous&#8221; West 4th Street Basketball courts where all the foolish liberal White people stop and admire all the great Black sandlot Basketball Players.  I&rsquo;ve seen many a White girl there admiring all the tall Black players.  Right on the same street only a few doors down is a store that sells - shall we say - &#8220;sexual paraphernalia&#8221; for all the gays and lesbians in the neighborhood. For once, it is good to see that it WASN&rsquo;T a White person getting their skull fractured.  </p>

		<p>We white men need to take a lesson from the bruthas&rsquo; in dealing with violent black females. We try to talk it out and ask them why they are hitting us. The bruthas&rsquo; just bust out the club and commence to whoopin&rsquo; them. And if a club, brass knuckles, switchblade, razor, baseball bat, glass bottle, pistol, shotgun, AR-15 isn&rsquo;t handy, then ball up that fist and start swingin&rsquo;! It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a public place or not, when a beat down is necessary, watch out!!</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m not condoning this behavior BTW. If they want to behave like animals, then we need to give them their own areas to misbehave in.)</p>

Many of these McD&rsquo;s are franchises.   It&rsquo;s quite possible he was the owner, defending his property, rather than just an employee. I doubt that an employee would be willing to go that far. <br>

The vicious counterattack by Rayon McIntosh was absolutely necessary. Black men &#8220;to&#8221; are well aware of the vicious nature and zero emotional control of ghetto- type black women. The smallest things can set them off. And once agitated, with or without cause, can set into motion an all to common freak out session. it&rsquo;s as if they hey cannot stop themselves.</p>
<p>McIntosh knew instinctively he must fight them like men when they jumped the counter. Slapping him in the face didn&rsquo;t help the situation any either for the ghetto gals. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written in the past about the extra violent and confrontational edge northern urban blacks display. The black women in particular up here, have such a large chip on their shoulders it manifests into psychosis.  </p>
<p>I hate McDonalds,- always have.</p>

		<p>I dont understand why the cashier was charged. In my opinion, he&rsquo;s a hero for standing up to these trouble makers. They slapped him and then come behind the counter, at that point all bets are off. I find it appalling that he is being charged for defending himself against these 2 criminals. </p>

		<p>The irony of this video is that this guy did exactly what you are supposed to do during a fight.  Faced with multiple opponents, he retreated and grabbed an equalizer, then he got on first one, then the other, beat them to the ground and kept hitting them until they stopped moving.</p>
<p>They were the aggressors and got on him.  He doesn&rsquo;t know if they are armed or not.  Doesn&rsquo;t know if they might pick up a kitchen knife and stab him. Or whip boiling grease into his face.  Anything can happen in a situation like this.</p>
<p>This is not a fight&hellip;..it&rsquo;s an assault and the cashier is acting in self-defense, I&rsquo;d say right up until the last 3 seconds, when he gives a bash or two for good measure.  Of course, we can&rsquo;t see what these women are doing on the floor.  Lying in a pool of blood and whimpering?  Or drawing a straight razor from a pocket and preparing to cut him at first opportunity.  Personally, I wear steel toe shoes for exactly this situation.  Several kicks to the face and temple will take the fight out of someone who isn&rsquo;t willing to give up so easily.  Almost no one recognizes them as weapons.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a big problem though.  He&rsquo;s an ex-con and the assumption is that he is guilty.  Plus the aggressors are women and despite women committing significant violence, murder and mayhem, especially black women, the assumption will be they are victims&hellip;.despite their obviously being the aggressor.</p>
<p>This could easily have turned out different though, with these women pulling handguns and shooting everyone behind the counter.  Remember that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I&rsquo;m also reminded of a couple years ago of a lady calling 911 because a McDonald&rsquo;s ran out of McNuggets. They didn&rsquo;t have McNuggets so she reported them to the police, not management.</p>

		<p>The news report is biased insofar as it starts of with the end of the altercation, not the beginning where the cashier was attacked by the two harpies. The reaction is certainly over the top but on par for the type.</p>

		<p>Self-defense  &mdash; he simply got a little enthusiastic.</p>
<p>He was slapped, then the other perp ran around the other side of the counter to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE. They should think about promoting this man. He made a very bad mistake before, and this is not a reprise. The injustice here is his arrest.<br>

		<p>Typical CBS MSM bias. The attackers who hit the cashier and climbed over the counter and tried to rob and assault the cashier are &ldquo;victims&rdquo;. The cashier who defended himself when the assailants got behind the counter is the &ldquo;savage attacker&rdquo;.<br>
They talked about the cashier&rsquo;s prison record but nothing about the arrest records of the assailants who jumped over the counter. No info on whether they were armed.</p>
<p>Cashier didn&rsquo;t start it and was defending himself. He will probably go to prison. <br>

The two Black women are used to being treated with kid gloves and given what they demand when they complain, especially when get their head and neck moving in the typical sideways motion. The Black guy was not having any of the intimidation They tried the same thing they use on whites, but got a black man who can fight back without going to prison for life for hate crime!</p>

		<p>They kept getting up when he told them to stay down so he had to hit them a few more times in order achieve submission. If he wanted to he could have killed them but he controlled himself.</p>
<p>Any time you have your attackers down you don&rsquo;t let them have a second chance to assault you and possibly kill you.</p>

		<p>Assailants are usually armed with a knife or some other weapon. After someone defends himself they always start screaming and shouting and telling him to stop. If he stops, they assault him again. There were two of them. They were working together. He had to make sure they didn&rsquo;t get back up and attack him.</p>
<p>Standard MO is to go into a place and start a big argument with the clerk.  While one robber is in the clerk&rsquo;s face yelling the other jumps the counter and goes for the cash register.  The idea is to get the clerk distracted thinking it is an argument so he won&rsquo;t hit the police alarm under the counter. </p>

		<p>His time served in prison taught him to hit till they don&rsquo;t move. This is why you should not initiate an assault on someone, you never know what their background is and if they just might snap.</p>
<p>He questioned the $50 bill.  $50&rsquo;s are very rare nowdays because everybody uses ATMS that give only $20s.  Many clerks are trained to scrutinize $50s and $100s.  Back before ATMs, I used to cash a check for $50 every week.  The first purchase I made with the 50, the clerk would always look at it and often yell for the manager to approve accepting the 50. It was annoying.</p>

		<p>This is from a news article.</p>
<p>The 2 female customers tried to pay for fast food at 12:30 am with a $50 bill. They became upset when the cashier tried to test the $50 to see if it was counterfeit. One woman struck the cashier in the face and the cashier then reached out to push her away from the counter. The cashier then retreated at which point one woman jumped the counter chasing after him. The other woman tried to cut off the cashiers escape route by running to the other end of the counter and jumping over it.<br>
At this point the cashier grabbed a steel rod to defend himself against the 2 assailants. He struck both and immediately stopped swinging once both went down to the ground. Witnesses state that the cashier ordered both assailants to remain on the ground but they did not listen. As each began to get back up the cashier struck them again as his fellow employees tried to stop him.</p>
<p><br>
This report seems very credible to me. And as such - each and every swing was in self-defense and was entirely justified.<br>

		<p>Before this episode the two thought they were real tough.<br>
Probably grew up bullying and threatening White female teachers.<br>
Now they bully hispanic welfare workers and hispanic and asian store clerks.<br>
They jumped him with intent to whip him and show him how tough they were. They made a error in judgement and got an unexpected introduction to a real, genuine tough thug, a black man who was not conditioned to submit to their bullying.</p>

		<p>Hey, &#8220;strong  empowered, assertive&#8221; black womyn, next time you climb over the counter to &#8220;get&#8221; some guy, and presumably beat the c**p out of him, you better PRAY that the guy isn&rsquo;t an ex-con who knows how to defend himself.<br>
It actually makes me kind of sad. The employee was simply doing his job. At least he was trying to work, and not be a welfare sponge. I&rsquo;ve been to many &#8220;respectable&#8221; places that test $50 and $100 bills, like my local grocery.</p>
<p>One of the &#8220;causes&#8221; of the Rodney King riots was the case of a black 14 year old girl who jumped the counter of a small market to beat up the middle aged very small Korean woman clerk.</p>
<p>Ms black thug pounded on the woman, the woman managed to grab the gun and killed the girl.  The black community of course went beserk.  How dare that old lady defend herself against the righteous anger of black womanhood protesting centuries of racism, slavery whatever.</p>
<p>Every poverty pimp preacher in town was leading marches.<br>

		<p>I would question a $50 bill, too.</p>
<p>First off, I&rsquo;d be insulted if someone tried to give me a piece of paper with U.S.eless Grant on its face.  Even though I live in a city that is known for a big piece of real estate he married into.</p>
<p>Second, 50s and (even more so) 100s are the bills most commonly counterfeited, and the bills most likely involved in the drug trade.  There are calls to stop printing 50s and 100s for that reason, and because most people pay with credit or debit cards these days.</p>
<p>I occasionally encounter a store that won&rsquo;t take denominations higher than the $20.</p>
<p>I know that the UK recently withdrew the £100 note, and that the £50 is the highest value remaining, mainly because of illicit drug and counterfeiting concerns.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing?  Once you go 365Black, you can&rsquo;t go 365Back.</p>

		<p>This is a sad sad encounter. Life in Amerika has become so violent and terroristic. This fine young gentleman of McD&rsquo;s is being terrorized by two black militant females who are obviously attempting to pass counterfeit money. This fine young gentleman has every right to dismiss their criminal attempt to defraud the McD company. Not only dismiss the money laundering but also the battery to his left cheekbone. The pain and humiliation this young gentleman must have felt by being victimized by these wanton criminals could not go without retaliation and a manly attempt to right a wrong. The liberal media can spin this however they choose but in the end the video reveals the truth. A young gentleman defending himself from assault and battery and possibly even murder. Thank goodness some people are finally standing up for themselves and doing a grand smack down on the violent slime of Amerika.</p>

		<p>Well, what does McDonalds expect? They advertise for black customers all the time and love and promote diversity. How many of these videos do we have to see at all of these fast food joints where blacks are always the perps? Blacks are violent, loud and abrasive, will go off at a moments notice, and belong in their natural habitat. AFRICA.  Any White that goes into these places are brain dead. Just thinking of WHO is preparing the food in the kitchens should give Whites a warning not to eat at those &#8220;diversity hell&rsquo;s kitchens&#8221;.</p>

<p>Okay, LISTEN to the video.  The black guy was 31 the day this happened.  He shot and killed a classmate in high school in 2000.  Okay, 2011 - 2000 = 11.  So, 11 years ago the guy was in high school&hellip;.when he was 20 years old.   LOL  </p>
<p>I wonder how many kids all 3 have on welfare right now?</p>
<p>Did the FATHERS of any of the 3 have any comment to make?</p>

		<p>McDonalds has made it very clear that they are betting on non-whites in their advertising and hiring policies.  Their ads are full of race mixing and overt negrophilia. Their restaurants are full of low class blacks who frequently boil over in some pointless chaotic violent stupidity on a regular basis.  Do yourself a favor and just go to another place.  If you trade with them you are only trading with the enemy.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m kinda disappointed this abridge clip with some rather manipulative commentary was attached.  The full clip shows quite clearly, two violent, unruly drunks getting into it for no reason.  They punch him in the face as a prelude to an assault, and jump to counter to go after him.  What happens next is clearly self defense, and, if you are ever assaulted, absolutely what you should be doing if you expect to survive.  He may or may not get into some trouble for taking a few whacks while they were down</p>

		<p>The first thing that came to my mind when I saw this was the Jerome Ersklind case. Yes, Ersklind had every right to shoot the thugs in the store (and to doubletap the one on the ground) and no I am not comparing the behavior of the black thug with the iron bar to that pharmacist-But thug or not, the employee had every right to defend himself. They hit him first, and then they hopped the table.</p>
<p>I cannot stand when someone with dollar signs in their eyes and an axe to grind tries to armchair quarterback the actions of someone who&rsquo;s life has been threatened, whether it is a police officer, a prison guard, or even a lowly McDonald&rsquo;s employee with past felonies on his jacket.</p>
<p>There were two of them, one of him. They escalated it to assault and battery first. Adrenaline is not easy to control. He should be exonerrated.</p>

Though in my opinion the last couple of licks were unjustified once they were on the ground and no longer a threat, I didn&rsquo;t see a problem with his initial actions.  They had already attacked him once, went storming behind the counter to continue their assault and underestimated their opponent.  In the end though, McDonald&rsquo;s will settle for millions to make this go away.  Couldn&rsquo;t happen to a more deserving company.  I&rsquo;m lovin&rsquo; it!!</p>

		<p>Having the perspective of a long life, I just don&rsquo;t remember incidents like these forty years ago. It would never occur to me to slap a counter clerk because he wouldn&rsquo;t take a $50 bill. He was probably ordered to mark/test the bill and not take suspected counterfeits by his supervisor. Our increasingly reckless violence is due to the sense of entitlement and grievance that many minorities seem to carry in their backpacks. The radical quest for equality and &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; has made a whole generation grow up without manners.  Unfortunately, this includes some degenerate whites, as well as minorities. </p>

It is not illegal to defend yourself by injuring or even killing an attacker, but only if it is necessary. It is illegal to inflict any damage on attacker after the attacker has become disabled. </p>

		<p>For the life of me I&rsquo;ll never understand why the owner of a private business cannot refuse service to any damn one he decides to..and not just on a case-by-case basis.  What&rsquo;s wrong with putting out a sign saying &#8220;No Blacks Allowed&#8221; or &#8220;Only English Speakers Allowed?&#8221; or &#8220;No Toddlers Period!&#8221;  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure if someone put out a sign saying &#8220;No Whites Allowed&#8221; or &#8220;No Gringos Allowed.  Only Spanish Spoken Here&#8221; the DOJ wouldn&rsquo;t bat an eye!  (Most places like this don&rsquo;t need to put out signs, however.  Whites know where they are not wanted and would be taking their lives in their hands to even walk inside!)</p>
<p>OK.  Don&rsquo;t call it a &#8220;business.&#8221;  Call it a &#8220;private club.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same goes for airlines.  I&rsquo;d pay extra to be seated on a &#8220;No Blacks or Moslems Allowed&#8221; plane.  No discrimination intended; how about offering &#8220;Only Moslem&#8221; Flights, &#8220;Only Black&#8221; Flights or &#8220;Only Parents with Screaming Infants&#8221; Flights?  I think these ideas would MAKE money!</p>
<p>Look, if it&rsquo;s a bad decision, the free market will decide and those policies will run the business into bankruptcy.  Why does this nanny state tell me whom I can &amp; cannot choose to serve?  I see signs all the time that say &#8220;No Shoes, No Shirts, No Service!&#8221;  And that seems perfectly acceptable.  How is my idea any different, much less any worse?</p>

<p>It must must be pointed out (for others&rsquo; sake)  that this is in Greenwich Village, which is generally well-to-do, very expensive,  and NOT black. These are not local blacks who come to  hang around there. They take the subway straight down from Harlem, or from Brooklyn, a matter of minutes.  Also from Newark. This is good hunting ground.  They are there to pick up white girls, rob white people, bash gays, look for sex, steal cars, or find whatever mischief they can. In other words, they are there as predators and outsiders. They could not afford to live in such an area. </p>
<p>There is very little crime in the 4th Precinct, except for that committed BY OUTSIDERS, like these blacks who go there to prey on the locals. The area is heavily populated by ultra-liberal arty types, and students (and faculty) from NYU, who love blacks in theory but manage to live far apart from them. </p>
<p>Btw, I believe that McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants  have a sign stating that they do not accept bills higher thatn $20, That is their policy, so that should be beyond argument. <br>

<p>Has McDonalds looked at the census?  How can they survive on 12 or 13 percent of the population. Probably they are hoping to make it up with hispanics.  But their advertising even in California is mostly blacks, not hispanics.</p>
<p>When hispanics first moved into Carson, Watts, S Central, Compton and other dangerous black neighborhoods the kids were under strict instructions to come directly home from school and stay inside.  When ever possible an adult picked and took them home preferrably in a car instead of walking.<br>

		<p>About seven years ago, we had an incident at a local strip mall.  A local sole proprietor style clothing store  manager (white female) told two black mothers and their gaggle of kids to leave the store after they were caught attempting to shop lift.  They left, but waiting outside until the place closed.  When the manager came out, they set on her, the entire group, beating her in public.  There was a Verizon store, a Bed, Bath, and Beyond store, and a Target on the strip, but no one did anything to stop the beat down.  This is in a town where white people were 80% of the population (there&rsquo;s more blacks and Hispanics now, providing higher crime stats).</p>

<p>Why is the clerk even out of prison? MURDERED a high school classmate in 2000 and already out? Wonder if the classmate was White?  I am sick of people murdering someone and getting out in 10 years or so..I see this all the time on Dateline, 48 Hours, Cold Cases, etc. Makes me sick.</p>

		<p>Lets see, they slapped the cashier, spring heeled sister jumps the counter to attack the cashier, the cashier being attacked grabs an iron rod and returns blows to heads and arms, and bodies.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still laughing at these fool &#8220;sista&rsquo;s&#8221;, wrong Mc and wrong cashier.  You need to pick a white dumo voting lib, lesson learned. </p>

		<p>#41 He overreacted while defending himself.</p>
<p>That bit of ignorance will probably cost your life if you are ever in a similar situation.  He did not over-react and, with a good lawyer, will probably walk.  The only borderline behavior on his part is during the very end where he pauses a significant amount of time, then lays down a few more smacks with the pole, while another employee tries to dissuade him.  If the two assailants are unmoving on the floor, then he is guilty of assault (unfortunately, it is illegal in most states to beat or kill an assailant once they are helpless).  But there is no footage of what the women are doing.  If they are trying to get back up, it is still self-defense&hellip;.even by the crazy laws of New York.<br>

		<p>Someone mentioned blacks on airplanes.  Even 40 years ago the White flight attendants had terrible problems with agressive black women trying to start fights over the food, seating, remaing seated during take off and landing, loading bags into the over head cabinets, anything and everything they could get into a rage about.</p>
<p>Quite a few White stewardesses as they were called then got hit and punched by blacks, mostly women.  The airlines never did a thing about it. Neither did the unions.</p>

		<p>Ideally, when those two sows came over/across the counter, Rayon beat the two of them into the next life.  Then, as he finished off the last one, the police entered, drew their sidearms, and sent him scampering after them.</p>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream!</p>
<p>Otherwise, after a careful review of the video and eyewitness testimony, I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion he had every right to brain those two (not that that would have been hard).  In any event, the three of them disgust me just by being in this country!</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to understand all races and nations, but I can never overcome my aversion to blacks.  They appear to me to be a caricature of the white man.&#8221; - Otto Von Bismarck</p>

		<p>&#8220;The thugs verbally abused the Mr. Mcintosh. One of the thugs struck Mr. Mcintosh. Mr. Mcintosh then retreated. One﻿ thug jumped the counter and gave chase. The other thug ran to the end of the counter blocking Mr. Mcintosh&rsquo;s exit. Mr. Mcintosh, fearing for his life, grab the closest object to use to defend himself against two attackers. Both attackers attempted to get back up to either re-engage their attack, or gain access to a weapon in their purse or backpack&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The question is did he stop hitting them when they ceased to be a threat or did he take retailitory blows while they were helpless? If he was using only the force necessary to stop the assault he has no problem but if he decided to deal extra punishment for them off to prison he goes.</p>

<p>Given that prior conviction, I wonder if that might well be the reason for his arrest. Could he be on probation?  In that status, any little bit of trouble could get him into more trouble. </p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on probation from such a crime as murder, you can&rsquo;t afford to get into ANY kind of trouble, because the law will automatically assume your guilt.  If you see trouble coming, just run away from it.</p>
