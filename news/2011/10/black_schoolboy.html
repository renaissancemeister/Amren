			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Murray Wardrop, Telegraph (London), October 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Adolph Cameron, head of the Jamaican Teachers&rsquo; Association, said many boys perform poorly because their fear that appearing studious undermines their masculinity.</p>
<p>He claimed that many youngsters turn to a so-called &#8220;hustle culture&#8221; to make money, rather than chasing careers built on academic achievement and hard work.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron warned that the attitude was affecting the academic standards of Afro-Caribbean boys both in Jamaica and in Britain.</p>
<p>They are one of England&rsquo;s worst-performing ethnic groups in schools. Last year just 40 per cent of Afro-Caribbean boys achieved five good GCSEs including English and maths, compared with the national average of 58.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron told the BBC: &#8220;That notion of masculinity says that if as a male you aspire to perform highly it means you are feminine, even to the extent of saying you are gay.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the context of Jamaica, which is so homophobic, male students don&rsquo;t want to be categorised in that way so that they would deliberately underperform in order that they are not.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lecture at an event in Bristol aimed at promoting the educational achievement of black boys and sponsored by the National Union of Teachers, Mr Cameron said that in Jamaica, boys were at least 10 percentage points behind girls in national tests.</p>
<p>Misplaced views about masculinity needed to be tackled in schools, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education &hellip; takes second place to notions of entrepreneurship as, predominantly our young men, get involved in the informality of what University of the West Indies academics have called a &#8216;hustle culture&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I would not be surprised if here in England the same or similar things occur in terms of how they feel about themselves and how the respond to and with respect to the society around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys are more interested in hustling, which is a quick way of making a living, rather than making the commitment to study. This is a supposed to be a street thing which is a male thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The influence of this attitude towards masculinity seems to be having a tremendous impact on how well African-Caribbean and Jamaican males do.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s a fear of being categorised as gay in a society where homophobia is so strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on to ask whether the notion of &#8220;academic achievement&#8221; could coexist with notions about &#8220;black masculinity&#8221; in contemporary culture.</p>
<p>Mr Cameron said the issue needed further investigation but there was a growing realisation among teachers in Jamaica that they needed to tackle it in schools.</p>
<p>Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said: &#8220;There are obviously issues for black boys both in Jamaica and the UK. We need system-wide reform to ensure that the system does not disadvantage black boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Experience tells us that some black boys do achieve, and what we have to do is replicate those systems which enabled them to achieve success.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The crabs in a bucket mentality.  The problem is, only a few crabs ever really want to get out of the bucket.  And likewise, this is only a problem for a small percentage of black students.  The real reason why black &#8220;schoolboys&#8221; are underachieving is because of their low average IQ.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re worried about their precious masculinity and fearful of being though homosexual, but the hustle culture they love so much gets them thrown into prison, where&hellip;you know.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight:  they don&rsquo;t believe in education, because it&rsquo;s &#8220;gay&#8221;.  Many of them turn to crime instead, and end up in jail, where they engage in homosexual sex.  What is wrong with this picture?</p>

		<p>This article borders on hilarious, actually.  I work in a prison, and blacks are the notorious sexual predators in every facility. There are white ones, but blacks dominate the field. </p>
<p>Blacks prefer slightly built young white boys first, but anyone they can overpower, to include other young blacks, will take care of their sexual needs. Blacks worrying about &#8220;looking gay&#8221; even though they can&rsquo;t spell it?  Most of them are, or at least they&rsquo;re bi-sexual, and it doesn&rsquo;t take long before the black booty-bandits are AIDS carriers. </p>
<p>Looks like the black and liberal white excuse-factory will have to manufacture another way to avoid stating the obvious: most blacks are blatantly dumb.  Hard comment, I know, but I&rsquo;m just &#8220;keepin&rsquo; it real&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Homosexual authors such as Jack Malebranche in his book &#8220;Androphilia&#8221; have argued that male homosexuality has indeed been hijacked by the effeminate.  Black men, homosexual and heterosexual, are able to speak this fact clearly.  When male homosexual culture is able to shake off the effeminate then black men, homosexual and heterosexual, will loose this excuse for their poor academic achievements.</p>

<p>The article is about school boys who may believe that studying<br>
is acting gay . And it is men who often indulge in &#8216;the Down Low Scene&rsquo; not school boys . And beside many of these men see themselves as straight,and some even speak badly of gays thus influencing how these boys view gays.<br>
I believe that this is just another excuse some of these boys use<br>
for not studying. If there were no gays in the world or they never heard of gays, these boys school performance would be the same. It is just a poor excuse, and they know it.</p>

		<p>Back in the 1970s when I was in (white) High School the dumbest boys were usually the bullies.  Acting &#8220;macho&#8221;, really just being obnoxious and rude, was just a cover for low IQ and an inability to do much else.  Considering that most blacks males are low IQ the only thing they have is to act &#8220;masculine&#8221;, which is in reality merely acting uncivilized.  Coupled with their low levels of impulse control and lack of white imposed societal constraints mayhem is the result.</p>
<p>As for blacks being bi-sexual, I do not believe it.  Some people here are confusing homosexual orientation with homosexual activity.  A small percentage of the population is born with an innate same-sex sexual orientation, both black and white.  However, because blacks are so sexually driven, much more so than whites, if an appropriate sexual object isn&rsquo;t available they will take whatever they can get.  Whites are much more likely to wait for what they really desire.  So it makes sense that black males fear being labled &#8220;gay&#8221; in our society.  They want sex all the time, lack impulse control, and will do their homies if given the chance.  They know it and fear it.</p>
<p>The really sad thing is that the United Kingdom has a large Afro-Caribbean underclass.  No Afro-Caribbean community, no problem.  Perhaps some of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s ministers should meet with King Abdullah&rsquo;s ministers to help them plan an Anglozation program for Britain.  Shouldn&rsquo;t every kingdom have the right, and obligation, to protect its demographic structure?</p>

<p>The explanation for that is very simple.</p>
<p>Lack of long term thinking.</p>
<p>They are unable to think that far into the future. They only see the right here and the right now.</p>
<p>And here it is seen as gay to study. The fact that they in a couple of years of doing their macho hustling thing will end up in prison where they will really be doing the gay thing, is simply too far ahead in time for them to grasp.</p>
<p>Meaning of course that the main problem with them failing to study isn&rsquo;t so much that it is seen as gay, but that they can&rsquo;t see the long-term benefits of studying.<br>
Remove the gay thing, and it will be something else.</p>
<p>The only thing that could get them to study would be short-term benefits. Like a reward after every successful test (and then we are talking a more materialistic reward than just a good grade).</p>

		<p>With respect to Anonymous:</p>
<p>I said &#8220;most&#8221; blacks are dumb.  Their ignorance is a willful choice in the majority of cases, but there is pervasive (and glaring) evidence of low IQ functioning among blacks. Delayed adolescence is rampant (and seemingly celebrated) in the so called &#8220;black community&#8221; where feelings trump the intellect and common sense. Criminals operate by this engine. This trait alone gives evidence of a race stuck in a dream world of pre-adolescent thinking, living on impulse, and an undeveloped brain.</p>
<p>A (white) acquaintance of mine is a Harvard and Boston College professor of Psychology.  He teaches both graduate and undergraduates, and he is as left as they come, but after years of teaching he has conceded that the black affirmative action students, which means all of the blacks the begin his classes at the start of each semester, are, &#8220;dumb&#8221;.  His words, not mine. He also fails them due to their inability to even marginally grasp the material.</p>
<p>Of course he has been threatened for his academic honesty, both physically and legally, but he sticks to his guns and has thus far survived.</p>
<p>Nobody can possibly claim intellectual equality when every hand-out, consideration, lowered standard, and hand-holding government overseer has been layed in front of them, free of charge, and then still come up with chronic failure in life. </p>
<p>And good for those black &#8220;African&#8221; girls who beat out the white boys in the GCSE, whatever that is. By today&rsquo;s standards with the Nobel committee, all they now have to do now is wrap a towel around their heads, and they&rsquo;ll be strong candidates for that prize.</p>
<p>Now name a few more black student groups who have academically bested any other race or culture. I ask only one condition of my request; you have to be honest. </p>
<p>Then again, name a black community - in the world - that is safe. </p>
<p>Independent thinking blacks with character and integrity and an absence of the &#8220;black values of failure&#8221; will succeed in most any goal.  But there are very very few Thomas Sowells and Walter Williams&rsquo; among their race. They are shunned, wholesale.       </p>

		<p>In a way this reminds of the fable about the fox and the grapes&hellip;the fox couldn&rsquo;t get them, so eventually he said &#8220;the grapes are sour anyway.&#8221;  Lesson:  it&rsquo;s easy to despise what you can&rsquo;t get.</p>
<p>Same thing here.  Blacks generally can&rsquo;t achieve what whites can, so they make fun of it, and make fun of any black that actually tries.</p>

<p>Your second paragraph was a wonderful rationalization. Many black males have a bi-sexual orientation due to their desire for anal sex and thus an attraction to other males. Even the most desparate heterosexual male wouldn&rsquo;t choose homosexual activities. That&rsquo;s why prositution is the oldest profession in history, or so the saying goes. </p>
<p>Blacks are second only to homosexuals in regard to AIDS contamination.  I know, dirty needles, etc.. Wrong. If whites are much more likely to wait for what they desire, as you so state, why are they leaders in the AIDS category of early deaths, i.e., gays? <br>
   </p>
<p>Having worked in forensic psychology for many years; decades, actually, the penchant for anal sex among black males is common knowledge.  &#8220;The Big Brown Eye&#8221;, male or female, is very appealing to feral (ghetto) black males in regard to sexual choices. </p>
<p>Just keep in mind the ghetto saying among the bruthas:  <br>
&#8220;Ain&rsquo;t no joy like a big butt boy&#8221;.    </p>

Even if used 85 (which most Amren posters claim are the IQ for blacks)  as the median for blacks that would discredit the notion that most blacks are dumb as a much lower IQ is needed to be considered &#8216;dumb&rsquo; . Moreover, it is not significantly different from IQ scores from  Albania, Iran, Turkey, Croatia, Syria, Iraq, and Bosnia.</p>

<p>I would not describe a black Harvard college student as dumb . The average IQ for blacks at Harvard is at least 115 given that the average IQ for blacks at UC Berkeley is given at 115 (Anydex  IQ Spectrum). Only 16 percent of the U.S. white population have IQ scores over 115 (if we accept that the <br>
average iq of whites is 100).  </p>
<p>And being unable to pass a class at Harvard doesn&rsquo;t make one dumb. Many of these students just need to work harder to pass his Psychology Class.</p>
<p>proactive wrote &#8216;whatever that(GCSE) is&rsquo;. Well the article is about black school boys in the UK not doing well on GCSE because they believe that studying is acting gay.

<p>Not to get off topic but I hope I can respond to your response.  A huge mistake we make is to judge blacks by white psychological standards.  Europeans, Asian Indians, East Asian/Orientals and blacks all evolved in relative isolation.  Most people were born, lived and died within the same village, or no more than a few miles from their place of birth.  There are, I firmly believe, certain hereditary psycho-social traits that have evolved in different racial and ethnic groups.  We, however, use a psychological standard that was developed by German Jews and to this day is largely dominated by both European and American Jewish psychologists.  Yet we insist on applying this standard to a completely alien race, the blacks.  What is &#8220;normal&#8221; for them is not normal for us.</p>
<p>I also firmly believe there are innate psychological differences between men and women.  I believe that, among other differences, men are more sexual than women.  If you have a society of all gay men I believe you will have a higher level of sexual activity than you would in an all heterosexual community, and more there than in an all homosexual female community.  This would explain the higher rate, or should I say almost exclusive rate, of sexual AIDS transmission in the white, gay, male community.</p>
<p>We can not, and should not, expect blacks to live up to our norms nor should we try to explain their behaviors based on our expectations.  While I believe that a small percentage of black males are born with a homosexual orientation I also believe that most black males, that by our definition would be considered heterosexual, are in fact just sexual.  Rather like domesticated animals that will mount a member of the same sex when in heat, aroused, or trying to dominate another animal. Are these animals &ldquo;bisexual&rdquo;?  No, just acting out an inborn behavior with the closet partner at hand.  Blacks seem to me much the same.  Blacks just seem to &ldquo;do stuff&rdquo; when the mood strikes.</p>
<p>Despite working in a city for almost all of my adult life and working among a largely black population I must admit that the saying &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no joy like a big butt boy&rdquo; is new to me.  It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, however, as black men love big booty on their women, so why not on their boys?  And if black men are more attracted to anal sex than white men that would explain the higher AIDS rate among black women.  Black men get it from each other and then give it to their women.  While there are straight, white, men who can function sexually with other men and gay, white, men who can function with women I would venture a guess that their isn&rsquo;t a great deal of &ldquo;bi-sexuality&rdquo; in white society.  Some, but not much.</p>
<p>In summation I believe our biggest mistake is judging blacks by our standards, something our forebears did not do.  Whether intellectually, sexually, or civilly, they are not, as a group, innately capable of living a Euro-American lifestyle.  This is something WE must accept.  When we do we can begin the arduous process of separation.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve demonstrated the soft bigotry of low expectations when it comes to black people.  Yours was a good demonstration of the psychological defense of &#8220;intellectualization&#8221;. In short, you&rsquo;re attempting to explain away the truth because it&rsquo;s either too uncomfortable to process or your career will be damaged admitting it. Don&rsquo;t despair, however, because you&rsquo;re the majority in regard the legions of apologists in the American excuse factory that invents chronic black failure. There is an entire victim-excuse industry that has made comfortable livings for thousands.   </p>
<p>How do you explain the incredible achievements of the most abused race in human history; the Asians.  Dr. Thomas Sowell researched this thoroughly. The Vietnamese kid who comes here with illiterate parents goes on to easily command the English language and then learn all that &#8220;German Jewish&#8221; material. As well they are in little, if any, need of outside help when it comes to honorable living. The very, very few Asians I&rsquo;ve dealt with in prisons got there by adopting the ghetto culture&rsquo;s values.  </p>
<p>The very working class poor culture that I came from (here in the U.S.) got by well, without harm to each other, and without depending on anyone, including the government. To learn if anyone ended up in jail for anything just didn&rsquo;t happen. And where we grew up, none of us kids ever heard of the word &#8220;regatta&#8221; until we learned about it in school.  That word is often used by excuse-makers for black people as a &#8220;racist&#8221; example of test questions, by the way.</p>
<p>Then there was black achievement before the avalanche of government &#8220;help&#8221;.  In many cases it was par with whites throughout the country.  </p>
<p>Blacks have been notoriously promiscuous throughout their history, but during the sixties, the black mantra of &#8220;end Western values among our people&#8221; really set of a social acceptance of sex anywhere and anytime with anything that walks, crawls, or hasn&rsquo;t been dead too long. It&rsquo;s a black thing, after all. </p>
<p>The black rejection of Western values has now infantalized at least 2 generations of black people as of today.  And they bury more of their children due to drive-by shootings, diseases, and drug abuse than any other culture.  Hispanics, however, have adopted the rejection of Western values rule so they are catching up quickly. All that this needs to continue is to finance their lives via government handouts and for people to make excuses for their failures.      </p>

<p>Well good for Barbados.  Pass the ghanja and celebrate that hotbed of peaceful productivity that enriches the world. </p>
<p>I should have been more clear in my question, apparently. Let me try again:</p>
<p>Where have the vast majority of blacks lived in Africa, Europe, Canada, South America, or America, and have not have embraced, wholesale, a culture of crime and violence?  Even the Scandanavian countries (and Scotland, and New Zealand) are experiencing tremendous victimization of white people at the hand of blacks.</p>
<p>As far as Harvard blacks; look at our current president.  If his IQ is above 105 I&rsquo;d be amazed, and I&rsquo;ve tested literally hundreds of people in that area during my career.  Jews and Asians top the list of IQ heavy-hitters to include members of those groups who haven&rsquo;t even attended college. Darn those Jews and Asians! Dare we walk around their communities at night?</p>
<p>Sorry, but your claim of black IQs of 115 at those Ivy League schools is highly suspect, if remotely true at all.     </p>
<p>Your &#8220;facts&#8221; are fun reads and would make great conversation at a college cocktail party, but the reality of the chronically violent black experience and their widespread academic failure betrays all the fantasy achievements of a very few. To quote Muhammed Ali after he returned from an African visit: &#8220;Thank God my ancestors got on that boat&#8221;.</p>
<p>Try this, Anonymous; Take a walk around any neighborhood at night in Detroit for at least 2 hours. Bet you won&rsquo;t come out without at least a beating by the hands of blacks. You&rsquo;ll be lucky if that&rsquo;s all you get.</p>
<p>While on your stroll keep in mind that Detroit, a tax money black hole, has been black-ruled for over 40 years with all the black school programs, black-oriented teaching methods, black counselors, black English, black psychologists, and black teachers that they have demanded and received along with literally billions of dollars at their disposal. Think, Haiti.</p>
<p>Now put your walkin&rsquo; shoes on and get to bookin&rsquo;. But update your will, first.       </p>

		<p>I believe that children use the word &#8220;gay&#8221; broadly. The word has almost lost its meaning&hellip;for yet a second time. To them, it means stupid, pointless, weak, possibly feminine, but they cannot grasp the modern meaning of the term. Black boys in Britian don&rsquo;t know or care about &#8220;Stonewall&#8221;, Harvey Milk, pride marches, San Francisco, etc. They simply use it as a general term to degrade something they don&rsquo;t like and don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;ve seen white adults use the term in the same way. The bland American comedian, Vince Vaughn, joked that electric cars are &#8220;gay&#8221;.  The term is used on South Park every five minutes, it seems. As a child, I remember hearing the term used often as well. </p>

		<p>In America, black youth deliberately underachieve (even though their low intelligence makes it difficult to achieve above a certain level in the first place) because they believe it&rsquo;s akin to &#8216;acting white&rsquo;. In the UK, black youth do so because they believe it&rsquo;s akin to &#8216;acting gay&rsquo;. </p>
<p>I have no problem with blacks (and other races) acknowledging the limitations of their average intelligence within their group, and working within that. But when blacks worldwide are deliberately underachieving because of the above reasons, there&rsquo;s no hope for that to happen, it seems. </p>

		<p>proactive wrote &rsquo; Sorry, but your claim of black IQ of 115 at those Ivy League schools is highly suspect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I made that assumption because Harvard is just as selective as UC Berkelely where the average IQ for blacks is 115(Andex, IQ<br>
Spectrum). And at the Ivy League  you would expect to find some of the brightest students as those  colleges tend to the first choice .  <br>
Furthermore if you assume that the black average is 85 and there are 40 million blacks, then about 1 million blacks would have IQs of 115 or more (as 115 would be 2 standard deviations above the mean of 85 thus 2.5 percent of blacks would have IQ over 115). Though that 1 million include all age groups,<br>
there are more than enough &#8216;smart&rsquo; black college aged students <br>
to fill up the Ivy Leagues. Bear in mind that blacks make up a small percentage of students at the Ivy Leagues.</p>
<p>To claim that the President IQ may not be above 105 is ridiculous. That is not far from the US average. Yet he is bright enough to run and win the highest office in the most powerful and wealthiest nation the world has ever seen in a country where blacks are only 12 percent of the population and whites are the majority. And what is the probability of the President not being one of that 1 million blacks with IQs of <br>
115 or more (using the 85<br>
that Amren readers and others say are the black average)?</p>
<p>When I googled,&rsquo;Obama SAT scores&rsquo;, I obtained scores ranging from 116 to 135. Some these estimates were based on his SAT scores .</p>
<p>As for crimes in Detroit and elsewhere I didnot give any excuse for those problems  in my earlier reponse to your post. Instead I tried to answer the questions you asked. <br>
However, you must know that according to MAP of the World, Senegal had the second lowest murder rate in the world for that particular year. Of the top 10 countries with the lowest murder<br>
rate 5 were in Africa(MAP of the World, &#8216;Top Ten Countries With<br>
Lowest Murder Rates). <br>
While Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Burkina Faso and Gambia made the list of the top 10 countries with the lowest murder rate in the world (MAP of the World), Russia had 33,600 homicides in 2001 (Crime in Russia,Wikipedia). By comparison, the United States with a population more than twice that of Russia had 16,037 homicide in the same year(2001). That is less than half the number of murders Russia had . </p>

		<p>The focus is on &#8220;gay&#8221; when it should be on a &#8220;notion of masculinity&#8221;. Mr Cameron said boys feared that appearing studious undermined their masculine image.  </p>
<p>Even among white pupils in Britain, especially those of lower IQ, a preference for academic studies rather than sport or mechanical trades is seen as a bit unmanly - this is acutely observed in mixed-gender classes where boys are more boisterous and girls scribble away at their books.  The development rates and relative proficiency in verbal and physical activities, between the sexes, and also between the races, are different. Blacks &#8220;mature&#8221; physically more rapidly than whites. They are also relatively more sexually active.</p>
<p>Homosexual activities among otherwise hetero males occur in male-only institutions which have no other outlet (other than solitary vice, which nowadays is catered for through industrial scale porn). Not only prisons but same-gender boarding schools experience this phenomenon; it has been rife in English &#8220;public&#8221; schools, and habits can linger in adult life. US jails are lax in preventing the cruelty of black sexual domination.</p>
<p>Outside domestication and in the wild, so to speak, mammals do not generally exhibit this behaviour. Among whites the innately &#8220;gay&#8221; population probably does not exceed 2% though it exerts considerable financial, entertainment-world and political<br>
&#8220;pink power&#8221;.  Blacks are more hostile to gays than whites (cf. the African churches re gay priests, &c;).<br>
 <br>
How many monasteries are there in Africa?</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks have from 3 to 19% more of the sex hormone testosterone than Whites or East Asians [which] translates into more explosive energy&hellip;the hormones that give Blacks an edge at sports makes them restless in school and prone to crime&#8221; (J. P. Rushton).</p>
<p>Solutions to the &#8220;problem&#8221; would include single-sex and single-race education; more intensive instruction in 3 Rs at primary level; earlier school release for black males and unacademic whites combined with industrial apprenticeship schemes instead of &#8220;street hustle&#8221;; a properly enforced anti-drugs policy, and (wait for it) eugenic sterilization to reduce the excessive underclass birthrate and incompetent parenting. </p>
<p>You can already hear the left-liberal and black-racialist responses - especially the H word - but they have no better ideas.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We, however, use a psychological standard that was developed by German Jews and to this day is largely dominated by both European and American Jewish psychologists. Yet we insist on applying this standard to a completely alien race, the blacks. What is &ldquo;normal&rdquo; for them is not normal for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>So very true.  That is where the nonsense that blacks suffer from low self esteem comes from. Prison, welfare dependency, slum living, thug children, promiscouis sex, all these are a disgrace to a German Jewish Dr.</p>
<p>All those shrinks who studied blacks applied professional class Jewish standards to criminal underclass blacks and diagnosed low self esteem because the blacks led a life style that was unacceptable in professional Jewish circles.</p>
<p>We all know what motor mouths blacks are.  When I was a Probation officer every ridiculous shrink report I ever got claimed that the black thug was &#8220;non verbal&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Actually, the black never talked to the shrink.  But away from the shrink they couldn&rsquo;t shut up.</p>
<p>Shrink criminal interesting bit of trivia.  Ever heard the term homosexual panic? Jewish shrinks came up with this to defend armed robbers who shot and killed their robbery victims.</p>
<p>The idea was that the ony reason the black thug shot the robbery victim was that the thug was a repressed homosexual.  The homosexuality was so repressed that the thug had no idea of his incliniations.</p>
<p>Until, one day there he was robbing a liquor store.  He had a sudden surge of mad, uncontrollable homosexual desire for the clerk or some innocent bystander. But his homosexuality waS deeply repressed.  In his mad hormone surge and overwhelming sex desire he decided to shoot the clerk rather than admit to his homosexual desire for the clerk.</p>
<p>Many of the black thugs were furious when their defense attorneys told them that this was their defense.</p>
<p>Homosexual panic as a defense to murder got shot down very fast when the gays organized themselves and went after the shrinks.</p>
<p>In addition to the untold harm they did, the talk therapists and psychiatrists and psychologists stalled research in mental health for more than 100 years.</p>
<p>While every other branch of medicine did research and discovered mew medicines,vaccines, surgeries etc, the shrink community stayed stagnanted in the false theories created by Dr. Fraud in 1890.</p>
<p>It ws the medical insurance companies that finally brought a halt to Dr. Fraud and talk therapy.  They decided not to pay for therapy that went on for decades but cured nothing.</p>
<p>That allowed the researchers to develop medications that actually cure and control mental illness.</p>
<p>Celexa, paxil, elavil, thorazine and prozac &#8220;cured&#8221; more criminals by claming them down in 10 years than all the talk therapy and fraudulent diagnosis did in 100 years.<br>

<p>Obama was elected due to his color and rhetoric along with an army of handlers behind the scene, money from Wall Street, and businesses that would be guaranteed perks and benefits by handing over the cash for his campaign. GE comes to mind straight off. And then there is the media. It has surrendered all integrity in their slavish devotion to this empty suit in our highest office.  Obama is an affirmative action president, and that says it all. </p>

		<p>So Adolph Cameron, head of the Jamaican Teachers&rsquo; Association, says:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr Cameron told the BBC: &ldquo;That notion of masculinity says that if as a male you aspire to perform highly it means you are feminine, even to the extent of saying you are gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the context of Jamaica, which is so homophobic, male students don&rsquo;t want to be categorised in that way so that they would deliberately underperform in order that they are not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it &#8220;racist&#8221; to characterize Jamaica as &#8220;so homophobic&#8221;? What if we replaced sexual orientation to race and Cameron was white?  Then we would have a white person saying &#8220;Jamaica is so racist&#8221;.  I wonder if this would be considered acceptable.</p>
<p>He is probably right about Jamaica being homophobic.  Generally speaking, blacks are very intolerant of minorities, especially sexual minorities.  But whites should be allowed to speak the truth as well.  I would even venture to say that whites should be allowed to use the name Adolph.  I mean it&rsquo;s been almost 70 years&hellip;</p>

<p>What SAT scores?  Obama REFUSES to release his SAT, LSAT scores OR his college transcripts:</p>
<p>WND columnist Jack Cashill writes, <i>If Obama&rsquo;s LSAT scores merited admission (to Harvard), we would know about them. We don&rsquo;t. The Obama camp guards those scores, like his SAT scores, more tightly that Iran does its nuclear secrets.</i></p>
<p>Occidental College:</p>
<p><i>Gary Kreep of the U.S. Justice Foundation, served officials at Occidental College with a demand to produce records concerning Barack Obama&rsquo;s attendance there during the 1980s because they could document whether he was attending as a foreign national.</i></p>
<p><i>A judge granted a motion to quash the subpoena.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8216;Obama&rsquo;s attorneys bent over backward to block us,&rsquo; Kreep told WND. &#8216;Obama doesn&rsquo;t want anyone to see those records. He&rsquo;s trying to hide them.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Columbia:</p>
<p><i>Obama claimed to be a part of the Black Student Organization and anti-apartheid activities. But according to the New York Times, several well-known student leaders did not recall his involvement.</i></p>
<p><i>Fox News made contact with 400 of Obama&rsquo;s classmates. No one remembered him.</i></p>
<p><i>Columbia University spokesman Brian Connolly confirmed that Obama graduated with a major in political science but without honors. Nonetheless, he was later admitted to Harvard Law School.</i></p>
<p>Harvard Law Review:</p>
<p><i>In 1990, Obama beat out 18 other contenders to become the first black president of the Harvard Law Review, where he spent at least 50 hours a week editing submissions from judges, scholars and authors.</i></p>
<p><i>According to Politico, there were &#8216;eight dense volumes produced during his time in charge there – 2,083 pages in all&rsquo;&hellip; Obama did not write any articles for the Review</i></p>
<p>National Review reports:  <i>A search of the HeinOnline database of law journals turns up exactly nothing credited to Obama in any law review anywhere at any time.</i></p>
<p>University of Chicago</p>
<p><i>The university offered Obama a full-time tenure-track position, an honor typically reserved for published instructors. However, reporters have been unable to find scholarly articles authored by him.</i> </p>
<p><i>President Obama wrote &#8216;Dreams from My Father&rsquo; while at the law school but did not produce any scholarly articles.</i> </p>
<p>Yet the press were able to access Bush jr. and AlGore&rsquo;s SAT scores: Bush (1206), AlGore (1335).</p>

 With an average IQ of 125 for US presidents (and president Lyndon Johnson having the lowest among democrats with an IQ of 126 and Carter 176), there is no evidence that Obama is below the average for presidents or his IQ is as low as 105. <br>
At the end of the day it is the American people who put him in office after view what he had to say.</p>
