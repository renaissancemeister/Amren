<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14812822">How China Is Winning the School Race</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yojana Sharma, BBC, October 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>China&rsquo;s education performance  &mdash;  at least in cities such as Shanghai and Hong Kong  &mdash;  seems to be as spectacular as the country&rsquo;s breakneck economic expansion, outperforming many more advanced countries.</p>
<p>But what is behind this success?</p>
<p>Eyebrows were raised when the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&rsquo;s international maths, science and reading tests  &mdash;  the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests  &mdash;  were published.</p>
<p>Shanghai, taking part for the first time, came top in all three subjects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hong Kong which was performing well in the last decade of British rule, has gone from good to great. In this global ranking, it came fourth in reading, second in maths and third in science.</p>
<p>These two Chinese cities  &mdash;  there was no national ranking for China  &mdash;  had outstripped leading education systems around the world.</p>
<p>The results for Beijing, not yet released, are not quite as spectacular. &#8220;But they are still high,&#8221; says Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&rsquo;s head of education statistics and indicators.</p>
<p>Cheng Kai-Ming, Professor of Education at Hong Kong University, and closely involved in the Hong Kong and Shanghai tests, puts the results down to &#8220;a devotion to education not shared by some other cultures&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Competitive exams</strong></p>
<p>More than 80% of Shanghai&rsquo;s older secondary students attend after-school tutoring. They may spend another three to four hours each day on homework under close parental supervision.</p>
<p>Such diligence also reflects the ferociously competitive university entrance examinations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all Chinese parents are &#8216;tiger mothers&rsquo;,&#8221; insists Prof Cheng. &#8220;But certainly they are devoted to their children&rsquo;s education.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certainly both these open and outward-looking cities set great store by education, willing to adopt the best educational practices from around the world to ensure success. In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, virtually city states, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,&#8221; says Prof Cheng.</p>
<p>The innovation in these cities is not shared by other parts of China  &mdash;  not even Beijing, he says.</p>
<p>Under the banner &#8220;First class city, first class education&#8221;, Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classrooms, upgrading schools and revamping the curriculum in the last decade.</p>
<p>It got rid of the &#8220;key schools&#8221; system which concentrated resources only on top students and elite schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in.</p>
<p><strong>Showcase schools</strong></p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s schools are now a showcase for the country. About 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s. Its survival as a service and management hub for China depended on upgrading knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>In the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on raising the bar and closing the gap or &#8220;lifting the floor&#8221; for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants.</p>
<p>The report, How the World&rsquo;s Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong&rsquo;s education system among the best in the world.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong schools are undergoing another huge reform, lopping off the final year of secondary school and instead moving towards four-year university degrees from 2012 to align it with China.</p>
<p>Abandoning the old British model is a gamble and no-one knows how it will play out in terms of quality.</p>
<p><strong>Top teachers</strong></p>
<p>However, Hong Kong believes it has laid solid, unshakeable foundations.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the late 1990s we moved to all-graduate [teachers]. If we want to have high achievement, subject expertise is very important for secondary schools,&#8221; said Catherine KK Chan, deputy secretary for education in the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, like Singapore, now recruits teachers from the top 30% of the graduate cohort. By contrast, according to the OECD, the US recruits from the bottom third.</p>
<p>Shanghai recruits teachers more broadly. But it is already a select group.</p>
<p>Shanghai controls who lives and works in the city through China&rsquo;s notorious &#8220;houkou&#8221; or permanent residency system, allowing only the best and the brightest to become residents with access to jobs and schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;For over 50 years Shanghai has been accumulating talent, the cream of the cream in China. That gives it an incredible advantage,&#8221; says Ruth Heyhoe, former head of the Hong Kong Institute of Education, now at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>Migrant children</p>
<p>The OECD&rsquo;s Mr Schleicher believes teacher training has played a part in Shanghai&rsquo;s success, with higher-performing teachers mentoring teachers from lower-performing schools, to raise standards across the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is striking about Shanghai is that there is quite a large socio-economic variability in the student population, but it does not play out in terms of its Pisa results,&#8221; said Mr Schleicher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people have even suggested we did not include Shanghai&rsquo;s fairly large immigration population. Around 5.1% of the population are migrants from rural areas. Their children are definitely included,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Last year Shanghai claimed to be the first Chinese city to provide free schooling for all migrant children. This year migrants outnumbered Shanghai-born children for the first time in state primary schools, making up 54% of the intake.</p>
<p>Prof Cheng agrees the Pisa results reflect a broad cross section. However the majority of migrant children are below 15  &mdash;  the age at which the tests for international comparisons are taken. It is also the age of transfer to senior secondaries.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they were allowed to attend senior secondary schools in the city, the results would be very different,&#8221; said Prof Cheng.</p>
<p>Even now &#8220;to some extent, where people are born largely determines their chances of educational success&#8221;, said Gu Jun, a professor of sociology at Shanghai university.</p>
<p>Their societies are changing rapidly and for both Shanghai and Hong Kong, being top might prove to be easier than staying there.</p>

<p>Sure, Asians are more prominent than before, but they&rsquo;re not essential leaders or dominant trailblazers. Never have been. No Asiatic Prometheus. They just slavishly subordinate themselves to their parents&rsquo; requests &amp; study more assiduously. Good for high maintenance of the already present technology, not good enough for path-breaking. </p>

		<p>A) American schools do a tremendous job given what they have to <br>
work with,</p>
<p>B) Asian countries score better not only because of homogeneous IQs, but also because they weed out the dummies. We educate everyone,</p>
<p>C) When measured strictly whites against China or Japan, etc, Americans score statistically equivalent or above.</p>
<p>American schools are world class for anyone who tries. It&rsquo;s the fact we have so many students who are troublemakers is the problem.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe all this stuff about China. About 10 % of the populace is doing well, the rest doing peasant hard pick and shovel peasant labor in the fields. Shanghai and Hong Kong are NOT representative of the whole nation. Far from it. And the Oriental is so concerned about &#8220;face&#8221; they will do anything to beat everyone else.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t believe that stuff too about how much money they have and all that. NO business transparency or the like such as you would find in the U.S. </p>

		<p>This just demonstrates anew why me need to stop Asian immigration to the USA. We cannot   &mdash;   and will not   &mdash;   compete with the bizarre slave-driving education ethic these students and parents adhere to. School all day and then more cramming for hours at night? What they get out of all of this is a massive collection of facts memorized and problems drilled,which allows them to excel at test taking. In a modern hi-tech society,much like the one WE hope to have once Barack Obama is gone, testing is essential for determining skills and choosing who will advance. But if the Chinese &#8220;game&#8221; the test, and their scores OVER predict their performance, they will advance over white students. Not only will whites find it harder and harder to advance in our own society, but we will fall ever more under the grip of a Chinese-style bureaucratic technical elite. Let the Asians stay home. I am willing to compete with them INTERnationally; but INTRAnationally I think we may be heading for a very bad outcome. </p>

		<p>1.  Lying.  Do you trust all of Beijing&rsquo;s official pronouncements?</p>
<p>2.  Not 100% of 15-year olds take these tests.</p>
<p>3.  Beijing is acting like a sane country that wants to grow and become more powerful - They devote most of their educational resources to their bright students, and little to their dummies.  In contrast, we close pre- and post-hours science labs to bright students so that the money can be spent on black and Hispanic dummies who haven&rsquo;t learned how to read very well by their high school years.</p>

		<p>I applaud Northeast Asians for their group oriented way of doing things and their discipline.  They do many things right.  I have stressed this many times on this website.  I think this author here explains things pretty accurately when explaining China&rsquo;s success compared to Western countries. American Renaissance, on the other hand, as the comment from the AR staff under this article&rsquo;s title indicates, needs to back off a little from it&rsquo;s obsession with Asian IQ.  </p>
<p>The high Asian IQ explains many things when comparing Northeast Asians to hispanics, Amerindians, blacks, Southern Asians, Southeast Asians, and Polynesians.  However, it is a moot point when comparing Asians to whites.  Asians only have a slightly higher IQ compared to whites, and there are obviously many unanswered questions in regards to why whites have created so much more compared to Asians.  This article even admits that the Chinese owe a lot to British rule.  I think Rushton gets a little too carried away when he proclaims the Chinese as being the first to live on Mars when they haven&rsquo;t even put a man on the moon yet (something we did in the sixties).  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give whites a little more credit when comparing them to Asians, as great as they are.  In the mean time we need to look at their discipline and devotion to their race&rsquo;s success and learn from it.  I will admit that.  But if we are going to admit to the success of Asians due to their group mentality, then we also need to point out the upper hand that whites have in creativity due to our individualistic mentality.</p>
<p>And what did the full list look like in this article anyways?  Was it a few select Chinese cities up against other countries?  That isn&rsquo;t really fair, especially since the author admits that these cities represent the best of China.  Plus, there are plenty of European countries that usually don&rsquo;t fall too far behind China in these rankings anyhow.</p>

		<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned about the Chinese mind is that they are robustly cynical realists.  There is very little sentimentality in their outlook on the world.</p>
<p>They know who they are, and they know what they want from us. <br>
The ambitious ones highly focused on getting ahead in the game of life. </p>

		<p><i>we need to look at their discipline and devotion to their race&rsquo;s success and learn from it.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true. White Americans used to be just as hard working and committed to their education and success as the Chinese are today. During the pioneer days, when whites who&rsquo;d been raised by Indians were rescued and brought back to white civilization, they would often run away and go back to their Indian way of life. A major reason for this was because of the difference in Indian and white parenting. Indian parenting was much more lax. White society was much more rigid and structured. Whites parented with the belief that to spare the rod was to spoil the child, and white children had far more expectations placed on them. </p>
<p>When I taught English in China, I recognized the difference in Chinese teaching style immediately: children who grew restless, jostled each other, or whose attention drifted, quickly had their hands smacked. It was not uncommon to see this about 4 times in a single class period. I also realized that the most well-behaved, and consequently easiest class to teach, was the group who had the strictest teacher. <br>

		<p>China practices massive selective migration in its cities: ordinary folks can&rsquo;t just pack up and move to HK, Shanghai, or Beijing-ONLY smart people are given permission to (my wife is Chinese).  These scores are as representative as taking Silicon Valley Whites and giving them education tests.  Not to mention that I have a sneaking suspicion that the Chinese let only the brightest schools sit for the test.  What a waste of time debating this!</p>

		<p>If Chinese are so smart, why have Europeans dominated?  Isn&rsquo;t it funny that even the most mediocre Indo-European Caucasian civilizations-India (the majority of whose population is ethnically Caucasian, if Aborigine-like Tribals and Dalits are excluded) and Persia, were still comparable to the most advanced Asian civilization, China, for most of history?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care who scores what on some IQ test: White Caucasians rule.  End of story!</p>

<p>When this report came out China was the only country not to release nationwide scores. Instead they released the scores of students in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing, their most successful cities and where scores would presumably be higher than in the poorer countryside.</p>
<p>Maybe we should have submitted the scores of MIT students to represent the US.</p>

		<p>The intellectual superiority of the Chinese can be explained by the imperial exam system. For about two thousand years young men who could pass the exams entered the Scholar Gentry. They were given high salaries, and expected to have several wives and many children. Youths of humble origins could rise to the top of Chinese society in a year or two if they were intelligent enough. <br>
 <br>
In the United States Orientals are far more prominent on the finest universities than in the population as a whole. They are much less prominent in prisons, however. </p>

		<p>Before the Renaissance Chinese civilization was technologically more advanced than the West. When Marco Polo published his account of China many in the West doubted that such an advanced civilization could exist.<br>
 <br>
During the Ming Dynasty, which existed from 1368 to 1644, the Chinese indulged in their version of American exceptionalism. They decided that they were the Middle Kingdom, surrounded by inferior nations that had nothing to teach them.<br>
 <br>
During the nineteenth century, the Chinese had two additional disadvantages when competing with the West. The Manchu Dynasty was entering into the decline Chinese dynasties experience after a century or two of rule. In addition, the Manchus were not Han Chinese, so they had difficulty appealing to Chinese nationalism.<br>
 <br>
During the twentieth century, when Sun Yat Sen died in 1925 he was not replaced with a man who combined his leadership skills and integrity. Chaing Kai Chek and Mao Tse Tung were tyrants who valued personal power more than the well being of China. The Chinese Civil War, and the Japanese invasion retarded the advance of China. <br>
 <br>
In the twenty-first century the Chinese are likely to achieve the prominence that history has denied them for two centuries.  </p>

		<p>Overall, I think China has a fairly good national average IQ. But I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s the whole answer for the performance of Shanghai and Hong Kong. As the article itself points out, there are two other factors. </p>
<p>First, those cities are extremely competitive and only the best and brightest can afford to live there. Indeed, only the best and brightest are even ALLOWED to live there. The government restricts immigration into those areas from other parts of the country. So the average IQ of Shanghai and Hong Kong is significantly above the national average. </p>
<p>And, second, China in general and those cities in particular are excruciatingly competitive. Those kids don&rsquo;t do anything but eat, sleep and study. Who am I kidding? Those kids don&rsquo;t sleep and they probably eat with chopsticks in one hand and a pencil in the other. So what you have is a group with a very high potential that is doing everything humanly possible to maximize their scores.</p>

		<p><i>Regarding why whites have created so much more, much of it can attributed to white Jews. Look at any field and the top performers, the biggest achievers, the ones who find the impossible, are often Jewish.</i></p>
<p>Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison, Adam Smith, Charles Babbage, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, all of whom helped lay the foundation for the modern world,  were not Jewish and were &#8220;big achievers&#8221; who &#8220;found the impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As did another White, physicist William Shockley, the &#8220;man who brought silicon to Silicon Valley&#8221; and who received a Nobel Prize for co-invention of the &#8220;impossible&#8221;, the transistor.</p>
<p>Elias Howe invented the sewing machine, for which, according to <i>The March of the Titan</i>s:</p>
<p><i>he  took out a patent in 1846. He then went to England, returning a few years later to find that the a man by the name of Isaac Singer had stolen his patent and had started mass manufacture of the sewing machine under the Singer trade name. Howe pursued Singer in court, during the course of which unfounded charges of anti-Semitism were made against Howe by Singer, who was Jewish. After several years, Howe won: Singer was ordered to pay the inventor royalties on all Singer sewing machines ever produced, and Howe retired a wealthy man.</i></p>
<p>It was Whites, the biggest achievers of all, who created Western Civilization which allowed Jews to flourish. (yes, I am well aware of Judeo-Christain teachings, of God and Nature&rsquo;s Law, but it is Whites who put it into practice, protecting the rights of the individual).</p>
<p>As another poster wrote recently, that merits repeating:</p>
<p><i>Whites developed cultures marked by rationalism, self-criticism, the search for truth, the rule of law and equality under the law, freedom of thought and expression, human rights, and the rights of the individual. These things mark Western Civilization, created by whites and only whites and allowed our people create the freest, most prosperous civilizations that have ever existed on the face of the earth.</i></p>
<p>Bigots wish to piggyback on our achievements, claim them for themselves or assign them to others while calling us Whites &#8220;lazy, stupid&#8221; or worse.</p>
<p>Give credit where credit is due.</p>

		<p>The whites may gloat over their achievements but it all can be destroyed if they do not value or guard the quality of their gene pool.  Presently, the whites are led by the media to believe that interbreeding with blacks and hispanics is cool.  It shows that they are not racists.  The Aryans (pre-white) went into India in two separate waves.  By the second wave, the Aryans from the first wave was submerged into the native population.  They tried to prevent interbreeding with the inferiors by installing a caste system during the second wave.  But it did not work and the advanced civilization again crashed.  The survival of this country depends on the quality of its gene pool.  This has nothing to do with skin color.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t delve much in history- this is not a site designed for this purpose. Also, the article is about school systems &amp; student ethic. But, just to add a few differing touches to the IQ dominant paradigm Mr. Taylor (and much of the commentators) subscribe to, a few things have to be mentioned:</p>
<p>1. true, Chinese have been during a few periods of civilization probably the most affluent &amp; prosperous nation/civilization. they invented s sort of printing press, paper money, perhaps powder and a few other things.</p>
<p>2. BUT, Europeans (Greeks, Romans and their successors in Europe) invented (or &#8220;invented&#8221; and developed):</p>
<p>+mathematical proof (Pythagoras)<br>
+logic (Plato and Aristotle)<br>
+autobiographic introspection (St.Augustine, Montaigne)<br>
+calculus (Archimedes integration, Newton and Leibnitz full enterprise)<br>
+polyphony (Ockegham and comp.)<br>
+modern mathematical notation (Cardano, Vieta, Descartes)<br>
+philosophy, not just theology, nor guru-like sayings (Greeks)<br>
+perspective and realistic art (Renaissance)<br>
+novel (Cervantes etc.)<br>
+drama (Greeks and later Europeans- Chinese forms of drama<br>
are not exportable)<br>
+mechanical clock (15th century Germany)<br>
+history in modern sense (Chinese got S&rsquo;ma Chen, but he is no match for Thucydides and Tacitus)<br>
+developed modern phonetic alphabet from Phoenicians which, in its Latin form, is the dominant global script<br>
+industrial revolution (early 19th century Britain)<br>
+democracy (Greece and later)<br>
+human rights idea (European-American Enlightenment)<br>
+blood circulation (William Harvey)<br>
+modern science (Newton et al)<br>
+genetics (Mendel)<br>
+chemistry (Lavoisier)<br>
&hellip;.<br>
+shipbuilding, guns, machine guns, automobile, plane, television, radar, rockets, wash mashine,..</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s enough.</p>

		<p>The Chinese, Mawkism or no Mawkism, have an American-like eye for what works. In the mid-80&rsquo;s a high member of the Chinese Psychological Society and also an administrator in a leading university, undertook to translate (no copyright barriers, then )<br>
and disseminate to six centers in the PRC books like  Jensen&rsquo;s STRAIGHT TALK ABOUT MENTAL ABILITIES,  Eysenck&rsquo;s THE INEQUALITY OF MAN, KNOW YOUR OWN IQ, and so on  &mdash;  this at a time, when circulation of such thought crime would put you in the mental wards in the USSR. This person wrote of STRAIGHT TALK  as being &#8220;exactly what we need&#8221;( the BIAS book by Jensen was in the pipeline  ).  The excellent traditional measure of general mental ability (&#8220;g&#8221;)<br>
The Raven&rsquo;s Progressive Matrices was being  standardized and used in the PRC at this time (when their use other than, say, in the KGB, was explicitly outlawed in the USSR  &mdash;  even for research purposes).  There may have been a partial U turn in the PRC  in the events at the end of the 80&rsquo;s but it is highly likely the Chinese are currently giving regard  &mdash;  whether quietly or overtly  &mdash;  to mental ability in allocating resources and seeking &#8220;goodness of fit&#8221; between students and the various levels of curriculum.  Basic.<br>
As noted in 05 above, they appear to be able to make allocations that relegate bricks and mortar and facade to far distant regard vis a vis brains.  American school buildings are the envy of the world in their luxuriant appearances and physical provision  &mdash;  yet out school system in its efficacy is about like Dresden 1945 after the dust cleared and the bodies were burned.  We have laid hold of Court decisions and media misinformation to effectively ban the use of IQ tests in American education  And we&hellip;just maybe..,.are now perched where the Soviets were in 1990  &mdash;  -facing a possible economic political implosion&hellip;..While China arises more and more.  The American Dream?  Where&rsquo;s the alarm clock?   <br>

		<p>&#8220;don&rsquo;t buy this IQ stuff. Chinese (and Japanese and Koreans) have been serious in education &amp; learning for past two decades (Japanese much longer). And ? Science-wise ?<br>
Here are Wolf prizes (I won&rsquo;t mention Nobels due to politicization) for fields like math, physics, chemistry, bio sciences, agriculture,&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data is your friend &hellip; only when you&rsquo;re bashing blacks and hispanics, right?</p>
<p>Do this exercise (I&rsquo;ve done it): check what proportion of American-born *NON-JEWISH* White winners there are. check what proportion of Japanese winners there are. Multiply the Japanese number by 2 (population adjustment for historical white American: Japanese ratio). And THEN get back to me. Do this for the Fields Medal, the Nobel in Physics over the last decade, etc. The Chinese will eventually catch up with their Japanese brethren. Like the Jews, the Asians have been asleep for a while. Just a matter of time before they wake up from their slumber ..</p>

		<p>John Engelman,</p>
<p>I respect you after having had some private email exchanges with you, but you really lose me in a lot of your posts.  What you write about China is basically what liberals have been teaching whites to believe for decades now.  It is absurd that whites won&rsquo;t think for themselves or do their own research.  How was China more advanced than Greece, Rome, or Byzantium?  In what ways are we comparing the two (China and the West)?  If we are comparing by scientific ideas as well as ideas that led to the modern world, we would be denying reality by NOT saying Europe was more advanced.</p>
<p>People like you like to mention Marco Polo.  I have read Marco Polo&rsquo;s writings first hand.  He said absolutely nothing about learning scientific formulas or math theories from China, but people like you make it sound as if that was the case. Bigger and richer in natural resources doesn&rsquo;t always mean better. I have been to maritime history museums and I have studied the history of sailing.  Even public museums admit that Europeans were equal to the Chinese in sailing at that point. Again, bigger ships doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean &#8220;more advanced&#8221;.  Other than the shipping fleets, Marco Polo commented on China&rsquo;s size, wealth, organization, food, pottery, and textiles&hellip;..and similar stuff.  All of these things had equivalents in Europe that might not have been as big but they weren&rsquo;t by any means inferior.  There are many historians who still debate which was really better (China or Rome?).  The only things Europe was &#8220;inferior&#8221; in was size and natural resources, two things which are hardly parameters to be compared here to determine superiority.</p>
<p>I do a lot of reading on the history of science.  I am well versed on it.  Just about every book on the topic spends 85% of it&rsquo;s page space on Europe going all the way back to Greece. So what was China doing during all those years it was more &#8220;advanced&#8221;?  You can only get so far in technology without science and that has been proven.</p>
<p>And to the person who said Jews are the reason whites have surpassed the world,&hellip;give me a break. Yes, Jews are overrepresented, but even if you take them out of the equation, whites still rule when it comes to achievements.  It is so lopsided, that I really don&rsquo;t understand why we always have white people on here trying to argue about China&rsquo;s historical superiority.</p>

		<p>In the mid-80&rsquo;s, before the convulsions that took place at the end of that decade,some Chinese pedagogy was looking very favorably upon the use of IQ tests and upon the works of such scholars as Arthur R. Jensen and Hans J. Eysenck.  Six educational psychology centers in universities around the PRC were involved. This coordinated effort was concerned with the standardization of more than one major UK/US test of &#8220;g&#8221;, reported in terms of conventional IQ.  These Chinese showed no reluctance to elevate ideology over demonstrated practicality or to wage war against the rawer aspects of the realities of bio-socially evolved human differences, among individuals and among  overlapping groups.  Some of this may have taken a detour in the time of convulsions, but it is unlikely there has been any U-turn, as it were.  Dr. Eysenck sent copies in amounts of six each of quite a number of his books to the aforenoted centers in the 80&rsquo;s.   Presumably many were translated ( no copyright convention then inhibited the Chinese from doing this ).  Whether in China this cognizance of evolved human differences has been quietly acted upon or open acknowledged by how, I don&rsquo;t know. But it likely has a lot to do with educational progress in China.<br>
It is true (ref comment 05 above ) that American schools in typical physical appearance and upkeep are  the envy of the world, but American Courts and PC pressures and media misinformation have combined to create largely a de facto ban on the use of IQ testing  &mdash;  not all that different perhaps from the official legal ban on their use in the USSR from 1935 onward.  The Chinese seem at liberty to allocate priority to brains  &mdash;  not bricks; to results, not glitz.  </p>

<p>Adjusting the data won&rsquo;t alter things much, neither for Chinese, Japanese or Jews. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to address the myth of Jewish &#8220;super-intelligence&#8221;.</p>
<p>1. Jews have been in and around history for ca. 3000 yrs; French, German and English not more than 1000 yrs (in presently recognizable form). During this period, Europeans from English to the Russians have changed the face of the earth, and Jews had lived a self-imposed suffocating existence, just like contemporary Arab Muslims in France.</p>
<p>2. Jewish contribution to the civilization is great, but it lags far behind those of European &#8220;Aryans&#8221;. It can be located in past 150 yrs, or so. The only true great Jews (or persons of Jewish ancestries) have been: Marx, Freud (both essentially charlatans), Einstein, Feynman,Von Neumann, Hausdorff, Proust and Kafka (in literature), Landsteiner and Vaksman in medicine. The lists for British, German, French, and to a lesser degree Italian, Russian, Polish, ..&#8221;greats&#8221; in past 150 yrs would have been much longer. Don&rsquo;t forget the numbers: prior to the WW2, there had been ca. 2-2.5 more French than Jews in the whole world, and ca. 3 times more English (in Britain). So- these figures are commensurable, not such a big difference in numbers. </p>
<p>3. Optical illusion. Not infrequently, Jewish nationalists, boasting of their compatriots&rsquo; achievements, count among &#8220;Jews&#8221; people with some Jewish ancestry (parent or grandparent), but without justification. How would have looked German military history if Germans had decided to promote Eisenhower, Nimitz or Schwartzkopf as German military figures ? I&rsquo;m not denying that Jews are, especially in the US, among the best achievers in science &amp; technology (and other fields): Minsky, Weinberg, ..<br>
BUT- this is great time for technology &amp; less than glorious period for fundamental science. Virtually all paradigmata have been created in 1920s-1930s. Among the greatest 20th century mathematicians is perhaps only one Jew-Catholic, John Von Neumann. Others are Germans (Hilbert, Herman Weyl, Goedel), French (Poincare, Cartan), Russians (Kolmogorov) Polish (Banach) and British (Turing). <a href="http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm" rel="nofollow">http://fabpedigree.com/james/mathmen.htm</a></p>
<p>So- Jews- who differ from Japanese &amp; Chinese due to the depth of their contribution to various sciences- came in the period of history where titanic achievements were not possible anymore. In chemistry, math, physics,&hellip; no fundamental insights in past 50 yrs. that can be compared to great works of Harvey, Pasteur, Koch, Mendel, John Fisher, Watson and Crick. Add a good advertisement industry combined with silence about avoidance of other fields (Army, big Oil business and big companies like Bechtel or GE, &hellip;)- one easily gets a wrong impression.</p>

Low hanging fruit. To give an extreme example - there will never be another Newton because Science is much more specialized and complex now. I have *MAD* respect for Newton and he&rsquo;s a hero of mine, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that a hypothetical Newton clone would contribute as much to civilizational advancement now than he did a few centuries ago. <br>
 <br>
Also, I can&rsquo;t help but notice that you&rsquo;ve cherry-picked nicely. <br>
From your own list you&rsquo;ve excluded the following 20th century Mathematicians RANKED ABOVE THE LOWEST RANKED PERSON YOU LIST: </p>
<p>Grothendieck (very much alive and absconding!) <br>
Noether<br>
Cantor<br>
Klein <br>
Hadamard</p>
<p>And really Poincare was a 19th century Mathematician. A mention of Banach should include Tarski (Jewish). And a mention of Poincare should include a mention of Perelman (Jewish).  </p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be involved into &#8220;Jew-assessment&#8221; squabble in a thread about Chinese schools (or any other, since this is a long &amp; absorbing topic). Just a few points &amp; I&rsquo;m through with this thread.</p>
<p>1. Ashkenazi Jews have become involved much, much later. True. But, after centuries of rape &amp; pillaging in Germany, Poland, Ukraine and Russia, it&rsquo;s questionable what can be said about their genetic makeup, which has changed during tumultuous centuries. Even more- frequently neglected Sephardic Jews highly outstripped Ashkenazim in all fields - Sephardim were Maimonides, Solomon ben Gibriol, Spinoza, Joseph Caro etc. The point is: the Ashkenazi &#8220;intelligence&#8221;, interpreted as creativity, is a myth. Especially when based on spurious genetic investigations. The Sephardim- Mediterranean, Iberian Jews have been intellectually active in centuries when Ashkekazim slept in comatose sleep of deep superstition. The point is- it&rsquo;s nurture, not nature. Sephardic Jews have, generally, the IQ like the rest of whites. Jews were unique among post- Hellenic peoples who actually assimilated Plato&rsquo;s idea that one becomes better, or a candidate for Heaven, by learning &amp; and cultivating oneself by pursuing intellectual endeavors. So much for IQ.</p>
<p>2. As far as English, Russians, French &hellip;go- these peoples have spent vast amounts of energy, resources and manpower on wars, battles etc. Jews- both Sephardim and Ashkenazim- simply didn&rsquo;t engage, due to known circumstances, in such endeavors. It&rsquo;s not such an enormous thing to form an intellectual &#8220;class&#8221; after other peoples had- in bloody &amp; expensive battles enlarged their empires and territories. killed &amp; got killed en masse, prepared the turf  &amp; built civilizations. For instance, during religious wars in 16th century France ca. 2 M people had been killed; in the Thirty Years was between-nominally- Catholics and Protestants, ca. 60% of German population perished. For all the persecution in the Middle Ages and later- Jews didn&rsquo;t suffer such catastrophic demographic losses.</p>
<p>3. As for maths- this was a link for illustration, nothing definite. The last truly great universal mathematicians have been Poincare and Hilbert. Poincare belongs more to the 20th than to the 19th century ( Poincare group in Special Relativity, contribution to the dynamic systems out of which emerged chaos theory and nonlinear phenomena). As for others- Noether is not such a great achiever; Cantor is not Jewish- this issue has been debated &amp; conclusively he is not even of Jewish extraction; Grothendieck&rsquo;s father was Jewish, mother German- so again selective way of looking at things (Grothendieck, indubitably a mathematical genius, is half- Jewish, doesn&rsquo;t consider himself to be a Jew, and religiously is, in late phase, something of a Catholic mystic); Hadamard is a great mathematician, but not in the league of Banach, Pontryagin, Hermann Weyl or Goedel.</p>
<p>4. at the end- HISTORY. In a span of ca. 500 yrs (700 B.C.- 200 B.C) Ancient Greeks had done more than the rest of the world (India, Egypt, Mesopotamia, China,..). In sciences, arts, military, politics, &hellip; This incredible era included Homer, Socrates, Epicurus, Pericles, Plato, Herodotus, Empedocles, Pythagoras, Alexander the Great, Aristotle, Archimedes, Parmenides, Phidias, Aeschylus, Aristarchus, Euclid,&hellip;   This unsurpassable acme lasted more than 5 centuries. Jews have been prominent in past 150 or so yrs. Now is the time of their prominence. But:<br>
a) this prominence is pale compared to that of ancient Hellenes<br>
b) it&rsquo;s just a part of general expansion of the West<br>
c) it will have sizzled out, like all things, in a foreseeable future  <br>

		<p>As a Chinese, I see some misinformation / misinterpretations above on China /Shanghai score.</p>
<p>Shanghainese are Wu branch of Han Chinese.  ( If Ashkenazi Jews are singled out within a tiny global Jewish population   &mdash;  15 million? 20? smaller than that of some Chinese cities  &mdash;  , there is no reason whatsoever that one can&rsquo;t single out some particular subgroup/s within 1.2 billion strong Han Chinese, right? )</p>
<p>Wu region ( Jiangsu Province + Zhejiang Province +  their  &ldquo;modern era spin-off&rdquo; Shanghai,  with population about 100 million) , along with a few other Han Chinese &ldquo;hotbeds&rdquo; in other regions, has historically produced THE top notch talents within entire Han Chinese population in China for the past 2,000 years, proven by the results of Imperial Exams.  </p>
<p>The average potential of Shanghainese (Wu people), therefore, is not merely above Han Chinese average, but at the top notch of it, if not THE top.  I have no doubt in my mind that provided with a bit of economical &ldquo;Flynn effect&rdquo; in the near future, a certain part/s of Wu region would have average IQ much higher than that of average Jews, rivalling that of Ashkenazi Jews if not even higher.   </p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s perfectly rational, for the Chinese at least, that Shanghai ( Wu branch Han Chinese) could outscore Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan (mainly Yue + Min branch of Han Chinese for HK/Singapore, and a bit &ldquo;average Han Chinese&rdquo; from all regions for Taiwan)  in PISA despite of significant economical/income disadvantage, since Shanghainese normally outscore Cantonese within China.</p>
<p><br>
HOWEVER, big metros such as Shanghai and Beijing usually are not on the top of the score list within PRC&rsquo;s annual National GaoKao Exam ( China&rsquo;s university entrance exam – THE most authoritive exam in China).  Within 30 provinces + 4 big metro areas (total 34) in China, there&rsquo;re at least 6 or 7 province ( much poorer tha Shanghai) consistently outscore Shanghai in maths and sciences EACH year in GaoKao.   <br>
 <br>
So if Shanghai can score #1 in PISA, it is widely believed in China that there are about 6 or 7 provinces that can do even better almost for sure.  </p>
<p>It seems then a bit odd of claiming that, yet the reason for that is simple: big city kids are almost always more spoiled than their counterparts in smaller cities.  It&rsquo;s a global phenomenon; ask yourself who are the top PISA or SAT achievers/ regions in the US?  Economically the most advanced NY Metro? Chicago Metro? Or LA?  No way!  So neither is Shanghai or Beijing or Hong Kong for China.</p>
<p>Finally on the score difference between Han Chinese and White Europeans, I would say if everything else being equal, Chinese would perhaps have a slight advantage on IQ front hence could be slightly higher on scores from time to time.  However, everything else are not being equal. This large abnormal outcome difference we see is more due to combination of  Chinese on average studying much harder and the whites being culturally decadent suffering from years of media brainwash into a &ldquo;culture&rdquo; where studying hard means not &ldquo;cool&rdquo;.<br>

<p>The country is in S.West Asia, but they are as White as Europeans. Planning a trip to California anytime soon? Be sure to do it during the school year. Go over to Beverly Hills. Pick any school at 3/pm. Watch the kids coming out. About 40 percent of the kids are Persian.</p>

<p>Thank you but I have met and worked with dozens of iranians/persians. They are not white by any means of measurement. I think your different opinion stems from lack of contact with actual white people and not people who merely claim they are white. I live in Europe and I can contrast your &#8220;white&#8221; persians with actual, native, white europeans whose ancestors have lived here since the ice receeded. You cannot. Persians are swarthy non white caucasians, period. Mentally and physiologically they are very different compared to whites. </p>

<p>There is no way to quantify one&rsquo;s achievements. But, also, big names in various fields can be pretty well ascertained re. their status &amp; contributions. Informed opinion of experts in the field is pretty much unison- for instance, no mentally sane person would challenge the contention that Bach, Mozart and Beethoven are the greatest Classical music composers. One may differ in opinion who&rsquo;s greater, Bach or Beethoven, but that both are on the summit is not disputable. The same with literature- Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, Cervantes, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Proust and add three or four names. These are canonical names.</p>
<p>As for Greeks:</p>
<p>+ they created Western man&rsquo;s mental forms and vocabulary. That is to say- global.</p>
<p>+ they invented mathematics as a science. No such thing in Sumer, Babylonia, China (despite rudimentary matrix calculus) and India (despite zero and the cyphers later adopted by the West). Suffice to mention the names of Euclid and Archimedes. The books to read are Lancelot Hogben&rsquo;s and George Sarton&rsquo;s</p>
<p>+ they invented &#8220;thinking&#8221;. From Ionians like Anaxagoras via religious Western Greeks (Pythagoras,Parmenides, Empedocles) through Plato and Aristotle to Stoicism and Neoplatonism. The rest of the world did not even come close. Sure- we got wonderful humanism in Confucius and naturalist Pantheism in Lao Zi, and mystical Pantheism in Chuang Zi, and in India six classical schools. But, this is not free intellect grappling with the world and the self, but more or less elaborate commentaries on already sacred texts (for instance, Upanishads and I Ching). Essentially, Oriental &#8220;philosophy&#8221; is theology. Helpful books are Russell&rsquo;s &#8220;A History of Western Philosophy&#8221;, works by Guthrie on Greek philosophy and great works by Wing Tsit-Chan and S. Dasgupta.</p>
<p>+ as far as literature goes, major Greek works are comparable to the Chinese in the realm of poetry, but surpass them in other forms- tragedy (the genre unknown even to the Indians), as well as detailed biography (Plutarchus). Whoever has deeply read Indian and Chinese literature alongside corpus of Greek classical texts will know what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>
<p>+ plastic arts. Myron&rsquo;s Discobolus dwarfs, literally, all Egyptian, Indian and Chinese art: <a href="http://goo.gl/E5lae" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/E5lae</a>, and Hellenistic art is even more impressive: <a href="http://goo.gl/kRxq" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/kRxq</a> </p>
<p>+ history began with Herodotus, achieved great universal work with Thucydides and others. Except S&rsquo;ma Chien in China, no such work even comes close. In India, Egypt, Mesopotamia- no history. </p>
<p>+ Greeks were the first to measure the Earth&rsquo;s circumference (Eratosthenes), first to pose heliocentric system (Aristarchus), we owe them Hippocratic oath and much, much more. We owe them the vast amount of scientific and technical vocabulary.</p>
<p>But, first and foremost- we owe them free inquiring intelligence, individualism and anthropocentrism expressed in Protagoras&rsquo; saying: &#8220;Man is the measure&#8221;.</p>
<p>As they say, &#8220;Greek miracle&#8221;.</p>

<p>I think posters who say things like this are just trying to be ornery.  I don&rsquo;t understand why we even still have these discussions on here. I have been posting on here ever since 2004.  I have been arguing with the Asian supremacists on here (as have many others) for years now.  We have posted the same facts (along with new fresh ones) over and over again, proving how Europeans have dominated in the sciences and math. I think what I write in my post above alone is enough to prove this.  </p>
<p>It should be obvious to anybody that Europeans have dominated in science and it is so lopsided that the posters who come on here trying to argue the opposite, demanding statistical facts ALL THE TIME even though they have been posted over and over and over again in the past on here and and in every book on the history of science,&hellip;&hellip;.these posters have some anti-white agenda going on. That is the only conclusion I can come to. Either that, or they like to come on and stir things up for no reason. </p>
<p> I don&rsquo;t understand how any white person can claim to love their race so much and then spend so much time and energy trying to degrade it&rsquo;s achievements when there are little facts to do so. Seriously people, what drives you?  History is history and facts are facts.  No matter how much you would have liked for the Chinese to have been developing Calculus and making blueprints for space shuttles in 1200 AD, it NEVER HAPPENED. Other than goofy liberal anti-white authors such as the one who likes to claim that the Chinese discovered America first (something that the Chinese themselves don&rsquo;t believe, and by the way, that book gets low ratings on Amazon)&hellip;&hellip;.other than that, I have yet to see any real historians claiming such things.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s drop it, and spend our energy saving our race.  It is ridiculous that we even have to debate these things among our own fellow whites who should be on our side.  It is disgraceful and ridiculous.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These are canonical names.&#8221;</p>
<p>They are canonical names IN EUROPE. In other cultural spheres around the world they have their own canonical names which people quote and use as a standard of quality. What is so hard to understand about this?</p>
<p>&#8220;Informed opinion of experts in the field&#8221;</p>
<p>As you say, experts in &#8220;the field&#8221;. You can only meaningfully compare classical music composers with other classical music composers. You cannot meaningfully compare composers across genres, because their musical aims are different. Same with literature or any form of art. It&rsquo;s like trying to compare athletes in different sports and determining who is &#8220;better&#8221; - only fanboys try to do something so obviously pointless to everyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;they invented &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>This just about sums up your entire position. What you are doing is looking at what is absent from other cultures that yours possesses and giving them a negative score on account of this, while looking at what other cultures have that yours does not have and dismissing it as unimportant. This is a specimen &#8220;Whatever subject I have no talent in is a load of crap&#8221; mentality.</p>
<p>Your need, for example, to describe Lao Zi&rsquo;s work as &#8220;naturalist Pantheism&#8221; shows this: you are interpreting it in terms of Western abstractions. This has no more merit than if some Sinophile came along and started talking about Pythagoras&rsquo; work as &#8220;the Tao of numerology&#8221; - it is intellectually embarassing. You are a Europhile; that&rsquo;s all it is. Nobody is trying to convince you to stop being a Europhile. But if you wish to comment on a subject from another culture, you need to learn how to do so without using the abstractions from your own culture.</p>

John Engelman,</p>
<p>I respect you after having had some private email exchanges with you, but you really lose me in a lot of your posts. What you write about China is basically what liberals have been teaching whites to believe for decades now. It is absurd that whites won&rsquo;t think for themselves or do their own research. How was China more advanced than Greece, Rome, or Byzantium? <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
When I wrote, &ldquo;Before the Renaissance Chinese civilization was technologically more advanced than the West,&rdquo; I was referring to the period of time between the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the Renaissance, although one might present a plausible claim for the High Middle Ages. During the Dark Ages in Europe literacy nearly ceased to exist. Cities greatly declined in size. When the Spanish conquered the Aztec Empire, the capital of that empire was larger than any city to the west of the Byzantine Empire, including Rome. <br>
 <br>
In China there was occasionally a war lord period in the transition from one dynasty to another, but there was never anything comparable to the Dark Ages in the West.<br>
 <br>
During the Roman Empire, the level of technology in the West was comparable to that in the Han Dynasty, which existed during the same time in China. Several Greek scientists made interesting discoveries and inventions. For example, Eratosthenes came close to accurately measuring the circumference of the earth. Hero of Alexandria invented a primitive steam engine. Nevertheless, these did not change the way most people lived.  <br>
 <br>
A much larger percentage of people in the Roman Empire were slaves than was the case in China. This large slave population reduced the incentive to find labor saving means of technology. <br>
         <br>
I do not know about Chinese mathematics, but Roman numerals were cumbersome to perform arithmetic with. Mayan mathematicians recognized the existence of zero before European mathematicians. European mathematicians only began to use zero with the use of Arabic numbers, which were actually invented in India. <br>
 <br>
It was only with the Renaissance that Europe pulled ahead of other centers of civilization, such as China, India, Persia, and the Arab world. <br>
 <br>
Fears expressed in some American Renaissance comments for the survival of the white race are exaggerated. Nevertheless, Orientals are able competitors of whites, and China may replace the United States as the dominant country in the world. If that happens, I hope the Chinese government will have become democratic. </p>

<p>Sorry for inconvenience, but&hellip; the &#8220;world&#8221; is &#8220;Europhile&#8221;. The West has become global, and only the West. The Chinese use pin yin for Internet, the novel-an eminently Western form, I&rsquo;m not counting such proto-novelistic work like Lady Murasaki&rsquo;s masterpiece- has become universal (in India, Japan, Africa, China), Classical music orchestra are here, from Egypt to China and Japan (I won&rsquo;t mention Rock&rsquo;n Roll), equations are written in Western notation &amp; the entire science, as explained in Japanese or Hindu textbooks, is Western in its profile &amp; origin. The universal calender is essentially Christian Gregorian calender. So, apart from Roman script in global context &amp; science and technology- even artistic &amp; humanistic fields (history, philosophy, linguistics,..), when global- they are &#8220;Western&#8221;.</p>
<p>No &#8220;Eastern&#8221; form of creativity has become widespread, except minor examples like Haiku poetry, No-theater and, in mass culture, Yoga and Oriental martial arts.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way how things work. For me, this little discussion is over. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The Aryans (pre-white) went into India in two separate waves. By the second wave, the Aryans from the first wave was submerged into the native population. They tried to prevent interbreeding with the inferiors by installing a caste system during the second wave. But it did not work and the advanced civilization again crashed. The survival of this country depends on the quality of its gene pool. This has nothing to do with skin color&#8221;</p>
<p>Huh. Pre White Aryans. Where did you come up with that. Ancient accounts of the &#8220;Aryans&#8221; who invaded India were ALWAYS described as &#8221; tall, long headed, light skin complexion, and light eyes. It is possible that 50,000 years ago our ancestors were not light complexioned. However 4500 years ago they were White as today. In fact, in the early eighties I traveled to some isolated parts of Central Asia where the people looked like today&rsquo;s Northern Europeans. They are very isolated and did not mix with the native dark skinned Dravidians. The native people of India.<br>
You are 100% correct that our Gene pool is the whole ballgame so to speak. The is why I have been warning about American Conservatives for 35 years. People like Rush Limbaugh espouse that America as been a highly developed civilization because of Capitalism. To me it is so absurd and dangerous that I will not even bother to debate a person who believes in such a theory. It is a thousand times more poisonous than the worst Communist.<br>

<p>The Byzantines were Europeans, or at least the people ruling that civilization were.  But you want to exclude Byzantium from Western Civilization in this paragraph you wrote here.  As for what was going on in the rest of Europe, the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221; were greatly exaggerated. In regards to your remarks about the Aztecs, bigger isn&rsquo;t always better.</p>
<p>As for the rest of your post, thank you for answering my question, but it seems you are picking and choosing certain negatives about Europe at certain times in history, that to me, don&rsquo;t equate to &#8220;Europe was inferior to everyone else&#8221;.</p>
<p>In any case, I appreciate your civility and honesty in answering my question.  </p>
<p>To the poster who keeps arguing with Bardon: You are a fine example of what I was talking about before.  Everything you are bringing up has already been answered in various forms by posters such as myself and Bardon. Stating that the Chinese had their own version of Newton is down right absurd and you know it. You didn&rsquo;t say that directly but that is pretty much what you are implying. Did they also have their own version of Neil Armstrong that the rest of the world never found out about?  Those sneaky Asians&hellip;.and oh let&rsquo;s not forget those evil whites who stole all their ideas and inventions from them without giving them credit.  I mean&hellip;.come on&hellip;.<br>

You two have no sense of humor whatsoever!  No, I am not a troll.  I wrote that Chinese dinner comment tongue-in-cheek and even sarcastiacally.  Don&rsquo;t you know SARCASM when you see it right in front of your face?   Do you take absolutely everything you read, word for word, so very literally? Do you imagine that everyone is attacking you?</p>
<p>And yes, I can see why the Chinese prefer to employ these little Mayans from the Yucatan in preference to American blacks. That doesn&rsquo;t mean I endorse it. I&rsquo;m just making an obvious observation that the Mayans are humble and grateful for anything they can get, rather than hire an arrogant  Afro who is bursting with attitude. The Chinese are being practical. Go in any Chinese business and you see them employing Mexicans, not blacks.  Where have I said anything anti-white?  </p>
<p><br>
These are simply facts. Get over it!   Good Lord, some of you fanatics need to lighten up! You imagine insults and criticism everywhere. Your narrow minds are more of a hindrance to us than a help.</p>

		<p>Poster 47 wrote &#8220;No &ldquo;Eastern&rdquo; form of creativity has become widespread, except minor examples like Haiku poetry, No-theater &#8220;</p>
<p>What planet are you on?  Even the Japanese don&rsquo;t do Haiku poetry or No-theater any more. Haiku is covered in middle school  classes, briefly, very briefly.</p>
<p> Haiku was only an upper class diversion for those who didn&rsquo;t have to work.  Literacy was very rare in Japan before 1880 or so. Only a few wrote Haiku because only a few could write. As far as No-theater goes, the only reason it survives is because the goverment subsidizes it.</p>
<p>Neither of those art forms spread out of Japan. </p>
<p>As far as the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; goes, that was an invention of the northern European protestants and atheists of the so called enlightenment period.  The people who invented the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; worshipped the ancient Greek and Roman empires.  They loathed the Catholic version of Christianity.</p>
<p>So they invented the myth that once upon a time in the farway land of Greece and Rome, it was paradise on earth.  No one was a celtic, german, african, middle eastern or other slave captured after battle, dragged across Europe or the middle east sold in the slave markets and worked to death on the latifundias or brothels.</p>
<p>Everyone was a free citizen discussing philosophy and advanced math with Aristotle.</p>
<p>Then along came Christianity and the evil Pope of Rome and destroyed everything.  Europe fell into the dark ages for a thousand years.</p>
<p>Then around 1500 the protestants and athiests began to rescue Europe from centuries of ignorance.</p>
<p>It is exactly the same kind of thing liberals today are doing to America and Whites. Revisionist history for an agenda.  The enlightenment bigots wanted to abolish Catholicism.  The modern bigots want to abolish the White race.</p>
<p>But before extermination, a propaganda effort against the people to be exterminated is necessary. </p>
<p>Columbus was an evil monster who exterminated all the natives even though he  never set foot on American soil and there are more Indians in N and S America than there were in 1492.  The founding Fathers were all evil slave owners.  All southerners were evil slave owners who whipped and tortured their slaves on a daily basis.  </p>
<p>All Whites are wealthy.<br>
Black on White crime does not exist.  All White woman who are raped by black men really wanted the sex and only reported it as rape because of racism.</p>
<p>When you look at what the reformers of today say about Whites and what the enlightenment reformers of 1600 said about the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; you see a lot of similiarity. Everything before us reformers was bad. Follow us to utopia.</p>
<p>Do any of you wikepedia historians know the real reason for the dark ages?</p>
<p>It was the bubonic plague.  Not the 13th century plague, but a much worse one that devastated Europe from about 500 to 600.  So many people died that Europe was essentially de populated from Sicily to Sweden. That is why so little history was written in those days, there was no one left alive to write it.</p>
<p>It tool several hundred years to re populate Europe enough to support scholars and libraries.</p>
<p>Cerca 600 the Pope sent one of the St. Augustines to England to <br>
find out if any one was still alive and if Christianity still existed.  Augustine found that Christianity no longer existed because of the depopulation.  He also found many Roman era ruins.</p>
<p>The depopulation had been so severe that the English had lost the memory of the Roman occupation that had existed up to cerca 435AD.  The English assumed that giants, elves and wizards had built those Roman ruins. England had no memory of the Roman occupation because so many had died.</p>
<p>FYI, during the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; one of the greatest hydro engineering feats in the history of the earth occurred.  The entire country of the Netherlands was created out of the North Sea and English Channel.  Much of it was done by monks.  Or perhaps they were the only dyke builders who recorded what they did.</p>
<p>Another but easier hyrdo engineering feat was the creation of the city of Venice out of the adriatic sea and a few islands.</p>
<p>Ever read that book &#8220;How the Irish Saved Civilization&#8221;  Saint Bridget and the monasteries and convents that copied Greek and Roman history, math, science and philosophy during the &#8220;dark ages&#8221;?</p>
<p>The reason western learning could be preserved in Ireland was simple.  The bubonic plague never got to Ireland.  So the scholars of Ireland did not die before they could pass on their learning.</p>
<p>When Charlemagen established schools and libraries cerca 800 he had to send to Ireland, not Rome for the scholars and books because Ireland was the only place in N Europe not depopulated by the plague.</p>
<p>Scholars in the Southern parts of present day Syria, Egypt and Iraq also survived being so far south of the plague area.</p>
<p>In addition, a major, perhaps the only reason the muslims were able to come out of Saudi Arabia, conquer the middle east and N Africa and Spain was because the middle east, N. Africa and Spain were depopulated because of the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>They had the arab horses and were probably more than competent armies, but if they had tried it in 300AD when the population of Europe and the middle east was high, they would never have gotten out of Saudi.</p>
<p>That plague was called the Justinian plague.  That was the cause of the &#8220;dark ages&#8221; not the end of Rome.</p>
<p>The end of Rome was good for the advancement of science and technology.  Rome had so many slaves that there was no need for machinery or even that many tools.</p>
<p>The ancient celts had something that looked very much like the McCormick reaper that did not re appear until cerca 1850 in Illinois.  After Rome fell, the Europeans were able to use their genetic mechanical abilities to create the modern world.</p>

I never said and do not believe that European civilization was inferior to every other civilization. It is true that agriculture and civilization began in the Near East, and only later spread to Europe. It is also true that at times Chinese civilization was equal or superior to European civilization. The Chinese may again surpass us. <br>

Washington Post ^ | 10-17-11 | Elizabeth Flock</p>
<p>Horrific footage captured on CCTV in Foshan, Guangdong province Thursday afternoon and now making the rounds on the Chinese version of Twitter, Weibo, shows a two-year-old toddler being run over by a van as she walks across the street. In the minutes that follow, dozens of passersby walk around the bleeding girl, not stopping to look at or help her. </p>
<p>A cyclist takes a wide berth around the body to avoid the body. One woman, holding her daughter&rsquo;s hand, looks at the toddler and walks past as quickly as she can. And a second truck, apparently not realizing there is&hellip;</p>

 <br>
I read any political thinker for insight, rather than doctrine. Karl Marx had two valid insights. He made one critical mistake that prevents his philosophy from being a useful guide to action.<br>
 <br>
He argued that under laissez faire capitalism, which was the only kind he knew, wealth would grow, but the average standard of living would decline.<br>
 <br>
He also predicted that there would be increasingly destructive economic downturns. When he wrote &#8220;The Communist Manifesto&#8221; in 1848 he foresaw the Great Depression that began eight decades later.<br>
 <br>
He did not foresee Keynesian economic policies, which counteracted these tendencies. Because of Republican deregulation and flattening of the tax system, these tendencies are again becoming evident.<br>
 <br>
Marx was wrong in maintaining that among working people class consciousnesses is stronger than nationalism and racial loyalty. The opposite is more nearly the case. <br>
      <br>
The writings of Karl Marx cannot explain the First World War, the rise of fascism in Europe between the world wars, and the fact that in the United States between the end of the Civil War and the civil rights movement lower income whites in the South preferred the K to a labor union.  </p>

When cruising the internet, it is important to have a firewall to reduce the chances of being infected by a virus. I use Verizon Internet Security Suite.<br>
 <br>
Sometimes you may be invaded by what is called &#8220;scare ware.&#8221; This claims to be software that detects and removes viruses. Actually it is a virus. If you do not recognize the software, it is probably scare ware. I have been invaded by XP Security 2011 several times. If this happens, try to stop it from scanning by pushing the x in the upper right hand corner of the software. <br>
 <br>
You should also have a technical support phone number to call if you think you have been infected. The internet can be fun and informative, but cruise at your own risk.  </p>

		<p>John Engelman,</p>
<p>Here we go again.  That article from the Washington Post is yet another example of liberal bias that states an opinion based on emotion with little facts to support it, and the facts it does list are false to begin with.  </p>
<p>The author of that article states the fallacy that I and many others on here have already proven wrong in this discussion: this idea that China was superior when I can count on one hand the inventions that came out of China prior to 1500.  That author lists irrigation, printing, and gunpowder as evidence for China&rsquo;s historical superiority, yet the average person should know that irrigation was developed separately in many areas of the world.  It is debated as to who developed the first moveable type.  Many authors say it was actually Europeans.  And then he mentions gunpowder.  Well it is said that the Greeks had a form of gunpowder.  But let&rsquo;s just assume that the Chinese really developed all those inventions by themselves before anyone else did&hellip;&hellip;How in the world does this mean the Chinese were ahead of everyone else in the world technologically at that time, just based on those things alone?</p>
<p>Then the author goes on to modern times and mentions a couple of achievements that the Chinese are doing in genetics.  Again, how does this mean that the Chinese are going to rule the world when most developments in genetics and most sciences even in modern times have been developed by whites?  Different posters above gave multiple examples of this.</p>
<p>As for the rest of our discussion, you are really starting to confuse me.  You started off with a post in which you made it sound as if you believed the Chinese were technologically ahead of Europe up until modern times.  Now that I have called you out on it, your story keeps changing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;However, it is a moot point when comparing Asians to whites. Asians only have a slightly higher IQ compared to whites&#8221;</p>
<p>5-6 points of IQ does not make you 5-6% smarter than average. Someone with 115 IQ is twice as able to learn as someone with 100, someone with 130 four or five times.</p>
<p>&#8220;whites have created so much more compared to Asians.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no natural resources in Northeast Asia. Northern China is the only region where agriculture is somewhat feasible, yet the land is erosion-prone with erratic weather and thus requires countless man-hours to maintain. Someone toiling 14 hours a day in the fields is not going to innovate much.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;In the mean time we need to look at their discipline and devotion to their race&rsquo;s success and learn from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the funny thing, neither the Japanese nor the Chinese or even the Koreans are in themselves homogeneous &#8220;races&#8221; of people. Taken as a whole each of these groups is a mash of two major subdivisions of two major races. </p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&rsquo;t really fair, especially since the author admits that these cities represent the best of China.&#8221;</p>
<p>The author is misinformed. Shanghai is the WORST performer when it comes to college entrance exams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plus, there are plenty of European countries that usually don&rsquo;t fall too far behind China in these rankings anyhow.&#8221;</p>
