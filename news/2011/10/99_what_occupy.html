			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Boyle, Daily Caller, October 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Though a few representatives of minority groups have appeared among the &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; protesters in New York City, photos and videos of the left-wing mini-throngs indicate they suffer from a serious lack of diversity. And the protesters themselves told The Daily Caller on Tuesday that they are conscious of the issue, if not the inconsistency it demonstrates.</p>
<p>A 40-photo Washington Post slideshow showing hundreds of angry protesters in New York and other cities includes no more than 15 clearly identifiable minority protesters, and just six African-Americans. The rest of the protesters shown are white, and most are male.</p>
<p>In 26 photos from San Francisco and Chicago gatherings posted on OccupyTogether.org, only one person from a minority group is clearly visible, and it&rsquo;s unclear whether he is a protester or a bystander.</p>
<p>Minority groups are similarly underrepresented in photos and videos posted on OccupyWallSt.org, the self-described &#8220;unofficial de facto online resource for the ongoing protests happening on Wall Street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the &#8220;unofficial&#8221; organizers of the protest events admit this is  &mdash;  or at least appears to be  &mdash;  problematic.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s an interesting question, and it comes up often,&#8221; OccupyWallSt.org&rsquo;s Patrick Bruner said in an email to TheDC. &#8220;Unfortunately, we have a very high turnover rate, and nobody as of yet has come up with official diversity related statistics for us. From observation, I can tell you that we&rsquo;re not all white, and that we also have a huge LGBT [Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender] population.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re working on reaching out to minority groups as well,&#8221; Bruner adds. &#8220;Thanks for the food for thought, I&rsquo;m sorry I don&rsquo;t have more exact information for you right now.&#8221; </p>
<p>The protesters have taken to calling themselves the &#8220;99 percent&#8221; in the country, labeling the capitalists they wish to remove from power the other &#8220;1 percent.&#8221; Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin told TheDC that the Occupy Wall Street protesters&rsquo; self-description as the &#8220;99 percent&#8221; in America is ironic because the crowds are mostly white.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Occupy Wall Street activists call themselves the &#8216;99 percent,&rsquo; it turns out they mean 99 percent non-diverse (by their own politically correct measurements),&#8221; Malkin said in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s as pale out there at Camp Alinsky as MSNBC&rsquo;s prime-time lineup or the New York Times editorial board.  Not counting the cameos by Jesse Jackson and Cornel West, that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan Gainor of the Media Research Center&rsquo;s Culture and Media Institute told TheDC that he thinks the crowds are &#8220;not as white as new-fallen snow, but almost.&#8221;</p>
<p>One minority activist has appeared to speak to the Wall Street protesters: socialist and Princeton professor Cornel West.</p>
<p>Malkin and Gainor also told TheDC that while news organizations have failed to report on these protesters&rsquo; lack of minority representation, tea party rallies attracted accusations of racism for what some reporters perceived was a similar lack of racial diversity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The liberal media will only engage in racial bean-counting of protest crowds when it serves their political ends: Namely, painting the Right as homogenous and non-inclusive,&#8221; Malkin said. &#8220;We heard endless derision about the tea party&rsquo;s lack of skin-color diversity from Hollywood and the national press. But not a peep about the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch-meets-Apple central casting mob swamping lower Manhattan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gainor added that mainstream media representatives &#8220;only see what they want to see.&#8221; He said reporters scoured tea party rallies for evidence of racism, while failing to notice how &#8220;white&#8221; the left-wing crowds are.</p>

		<p>This same hypocrisy was pointed out when both Colbert and John Stewart&rsquo;s affairs were revealed to be as lily-white as the Tea Party events. The reason these people will not be called to task is because they are &#8220;the right kind of white people,&#8221; rather than the &#8220;untouchable whites.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What few or no one has figured out is that these young people, mostly white men, are the result of the planned genocide of whites.  Here we see the results of AA, EOE, and Protected Groups and such legislation, practices in public education, etc.  We are suddenly inundated with young white men who sense their alienation from the wealth of the nation, of being included, etc., but they don&rsquo;t yet understand the racial aspect of it and why it exists.</p>
<p>I saw a placard early on that read, &#8220;This is the New Civil Rights Movement.&#8221;  Hmmm, I wonder if they knew what they were saying?</p>
<p>It will take some doing, and I bet many of the posts here will focus on those &#8220;damn liberal college freaks&#8221; getting what they deserve, etc., but these are the people who were brainwashed into accepting their own demise.  They represent a huge potential wave of white race realist converts.  The problem is that so many have nothing to draw upon but Sixties imagery - so far.</p>

		<p>On CNN boards a number of people have been noticing the whiteness of the crowds.  I have posted a number of times pointing out that these don&rsquo;t realize it yet, but they are the victims of 40 years of liberal doctrine finally coming to fruition as a generation of American white males begins to come to grips with the result.</p>
<p>This is the first generation of white males who will be so conspicuously sent to the bottom despite their education.  They have been turned out to wander off and die.</p>
<p>Or they might wise up and fight.</p>

		<p>The Diversities don&rsquo;t have time for the protest, they got the AA jobs at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>I had some hope for these protests and may still have a small hope, but I&rsquo;ve visited Zucotti Park three times at lunch time and what I saw was the typical left wing bash. There were signs for a People of Color Workshop, the &#8220;bookstore&#8221; was full of titles about Marx and oppression, I saw no Mises or Rothbard. Now big unions are getting involved and perhaps this is all a Soros/Acorn funded gathering:<br>

		<p>Back when I was an acceptable liberal and involved in the Democratic Party, I learned quickly not to count on blacks to get out and vote en masse.  Waste of effort until Obama superstar (but then try to get them to vote for a random white demagogue again&hellip;nope!  not happening!).</p>
<p>I have come to increasingly think that Caucasians may really be kind of hard wired for some kind of at least vaguely democratic polity.  The protestors, regardless of one&rsquo;s opinion of them&hellip;</p>
<p>Are getting off their butts and PROTESTING&hellip;</p>
<p>And going back to sitting on their butts, of course, when the &#8220;sit down&#8221; part of the protest kicks in.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s something.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Racist&#8221; is a word that has the most flexible definition of any word in the English language.  (Doesn&rsquo;t it infuriate your, or even break your compassionate heart, that blacks don&rsquo;t even know the word for &#8220;racist&#8221; in their native language?  They speak our language to condemn us, but they can&rsquo;t do it in their own.  Why do we even listen to them or take them seriously? They don&rsquo;t have their own language! If they will give English back to us, we will give them back to Africa.)</p>
<p>The definition of &#8220;racist&#8221; is owned by the user of the word.  If I were black, I could say that the white letters on my keyboard are racist, and poof, they ARE racist, because they then fit the definition.</p>
<p>The definition of &#8220;racist&#8221; is just being called racist.  If you are Whitey and a black calls you a racist, you ARE a racist, by definition.</p>
<p>Whites need to embrace this rule.  Never try to explain how you aren&rsquo;t racist by telling how many black friends you have and how sad you are that your company doesn&rsquo;t do more to reach out to the community of color and how shameful Jim Crow segregation was.</p>
<p>Just say that you are offended that you are being called a racist in the most racist language ever spoken: English.  You&rsquo;d be willing to listen if you could hear your accuser accuse you in their native Africanism dialect.</p>
<p>Embrace Racism, you can&rsquo;t avoid or deny it.  Get out front on this.  Define racism as stated above, and insist they use their own language and not yours.</p>
<p>We can win this one, but let&rsquo;s start by transcending diversity and embracing Whiteness- Whiteness Today, Whiteness Tomorrow, Whiteness Forever, for unto Whiteness Only shall we have White Life, White Liberty, and White Happiness!  Race Mixing Is Death, per Laurens, S.C.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t heard the expression JAP (Jewish American Princess used in the last few years, but I suspect that most of these protesters are upper middleclass young people who are horrified that they can&rsquo;t start out working at the top.</p>

<p>Who can forget the year Jon Stewart won an Emmy and his writing staff joined him on stage.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a cropped photo of the event. There are more White males out of frame:</p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/3mgm5e5</p>
<p>On his show, after the event, he sheepishly acknowledged and joked that his writers were overwhelmingly White and male (among other things). Everyone laughed and gave him a pass and all it took was self-deprecating humor.  Everyone gave him a pass because Mr. Stewart is &#8216;one of the good ones&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart, like all such liberal-progressives, sees the mote in the eyes of others (and virulently mocks and ridicules them) but doesn&rsquo;t see it in his own.</p>
<p>Clearly, Mr. Stewart doesn&rsquo;t believe in partaking in the rich, vibrant world that is diversity.<br>

		<p>I checked out the big protest Thursday night, (I work near downtown), there was actually lot of minorities, thanks to the unions joining in. A large percentage of the union presence was you typical black female DMV/Post office worker variety  of union worker.</p>
<p>You know the type, large, grumpy, hostile and sulky. Outraged that rich greedy bankers are millionaires while she only makes six figures performing some unnecessary or redundant task for some vast governmental bureaucracy. </p>

<p>True but they&rsquo;re PC hypocrites (branding the Tea Party as being racist and not inclusive) and confused about their message and motives. They should be called out as hypocrites.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another nice assessment of the OWS movement by Mark Steyn: </p>

<p>The only blacks I have seen have been in TV interviews with Jesse Jackson, Cornel West, and Van Jones.</p>
<p>If this goes on, I&rsquo;ll bet Jesse, Cornel, and Van will find blacks to bus in (pun interned).</p>

		<p>&#8220;the New York Times editorial board&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently the Times did an article on the group &#8220;Appleseed&#8221;. Appleseed promotes rifle marksmanship and the Times made a specific point of mentioning that the groups was almost exclusively WHITEY. As if that was BAD. [oh it must be so bad if something is almost if not totally whitey!!] Same with this group of rioters in NYC I would assume? That is what I call these people in NYC - - rioters.</p>

I thought your post was really thought provoking. <br>
I think it&rsquo;s true that white males like this really have no idea what they&rsquo;re doing; they have been unnaturally walled-off from inborn racial identity, with all that would have implied.<br>
It&rsquo;s like they have had very selective brain surgery, to remove areas that would have connected associations in their minds. They don&rsquo;t know who or what they are.</p>
<p>They may soon find out, though. Man, are they going to be a very confused bunch when the hammer falls. Their white-loathing dogma will collide violently with the need to survive in the post melt-down mayhem. Browns will be trying to kill them left and right, and they will not have the instincts to identify with and save themselves, like some poor ground bird in New Zealand who never knew predators. <br>
They&rsquo;ll get clubbed to death while they&rsquo;re trying to establish solidarity with La Raza and the Panthers.<br>
I hope they snap out of their brainwashing in time!</p>

		<p>The reason you will not see an abundance of Blacks and Latinos out there is because they have very strong racial identities and basically only show up to protests when their specific racial issues are addressed. They generally do not show up at rallies when it is for the general good of the people of the United States.</p>
<p>Some of the mainstream media act like White people are preventing the Blacks and Latinos from attending these protests. Their lack of presence is a choice these nonwhites are making. </p>

		<p>H/T League of the South, this is from the Boston Occutards&rsquo; &#8220;solidarity statement.&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We do not welcome any of the following in our community:</p>
<p> ■White supremacy (racism against people of all colors)<br>
 ■Patriarchy (sexism)<br>
 ■Ageism<br>
 ■Discrimination based on ability<br>
 ■Homophobia or heteronormativity<br>
 ■Transphobia<br>
 ■Anti-Arab sentiment<br>
 ■Anti-Jewish sentiment<br>
 ■Religious intolerance or intolerance of nonreligious people<br>
 ■Islamaphobia<br>
 ■Class oppression (classism)<br>
 ■Cultural intolerance<br>
 ■Discrimination based on immigration status<br>
 ■Discrimination based on experiences with the justice system<br>
 ■Disregard for indigenous rights<br>
 ■Weight-based discrimination</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just in case some of you were thinking that the Occutard cabal was some how a good thing.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people trying to compare the Occutards and the Tea Party Movement.  It&rsquo;s mostly nonsense, but taking the above Occutard &#8220;no-nos&#8221; at face value, I do see two similarities that they and the TPM leadership share.</p>

<p>Lenin arrived at Petrograd&rsquo;s Finland Station late at night on April 3 and gave a speech before he had even left the platform. In three sentences, Lenin outlined the Bolshevik program and his contempt for the Provisional Government: </p>
<p><b>The people need peace! The people need bread and land! And they give you war, hunger, no food, and the land remains with the landowners!</b></p>
<p><i>In March, 1917, Lenin was living in Zürich in poverty, the exiled head of a small extremist revolutionary party that had relatively little following even within Russia. Eight months later, he assumed the rule of 160,000,000 people occupying one-sixth of the inhabited surface of the world.</i></p>

		<p>Instead of occupying wall street, how about occupying the campuses or the professors&rsquo; nice mansion homes. For years these people have been told all their lives they must get a designer degree from these so called &#8220;Ivy league schools&#8221;. These are just as big business as the banks. They are huge money makers, raising fees arbitrarily to give raises/tenure, renovate or build another this or that, that has nothing to do with improving education. Students must take out mortgages, parents must spend retirement for these schools that can&rsquo;t promise a job after the degree. People attend theses schools to feed their huge ego and their parents. I&rsquo;ve always wondered why is a student paying over 150K for a social work degree that only pays 36K a year. </p>

		<p>Between their support for Oba Mau Mau, this anti-white race pandering, and the Soros takeover, they have lost my support and sympathy altogether. It reminds me of the Russian Revolution, there was really a third party and army of more or less libertarians, but the useful idiots chose between two forms of collectivism instead and both armies fought against the libertarian-like freedom army. </p>
<p>Support for liberty and white rights would be preferable. The vast majority of the young people in this country are brainwashed and fully indoctrinated. They are more often than not full-time &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; (anti-white) crusaders. </p>
<p>They are obsessed with searching out the &#8220;racists,&#8221; any white person who stands up for white rights and tells the truth and often any white who stands for liberty. They spend a good part of the time evaluating whites to see if the whites are thinking the right thoughts. We are in an uphill battle but we will win as we always have.</p>

		<p>#Anon #2: This is our Golden opportunity to reach these young, disenfranchised, White men and women, as well as the older ones that bought the lies of so many years ago, to help them see the light. </p>
<p>The College graduates who now have about $100,000.00 in College Student loan debt, as well as credit card debt, incurred from living an Campus, have no job prospects, in which they can repay what they borrowed. </p>
<p>These people are saddled with a lifetime of debt, because they, and their parents, were told the lie that a College education was their ticket to a good job, a nice home, and the former American Dream. </p>
<p>Say good-bye to that fantasy. Trade School is where most people should be going, for one good reason, which is that they can&rsquo;t export a Trade job that needs to be done here. </p>
<p>People will always need Plumbers, Electricians, Carpenters, Welders, HVAC, and Auto Mechanics. You just can&rsquo;t send your car out to China to have it serviced. </p>
<p>And you have the power over who you hire to do the job in your home or Store. Circle the wagons, and only hire each other. Shop at each other&rsquo;s Stores, and keep the money between us. </p>

		<p>All these whites are protesting against Wall Street, but where are they when whites are the victims of so much black crime. Why don&rsquo;t they take to the streets then? There has been so many high profile black on white crimes lately, like the murder of two young whites in Tulsa by black thugs and all those white victims of flash mobs. And yet whites can only protest against the Wall Street establishment. </p>

<p>&#8220;I checked out the big protest Thursday night, (I work near downtown), there was actually lot of minorities, thanks to the unions joining in. A large percentage of the union presence was you typical black female DMV/Post office worker variety of union worker.</p>
<p>You know the type, large, grumpy, hostile and sulky. Outraged that rich greedy bankers are millionaires while she only makes six figures performing some unnecessary or redundant task for some vast governmental bureaucracy. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt; Looks like the Unions and other groups rushed in to co-opt this movement.  It was wandering for a few weeks and it WAS mostly white. As one or more posters here have noted, some are even being paid to be there.  This happened the the &rsquo;60s.  The American Communist Party affiliated groups organized and paid many protesters, including white prostitutes, to go to Selma and do their thing.  TIME FOR AMREN TO RUN &#8220;REMEMBERING SELMA,&#8221; AGAIN.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that a lot of potential power was up for grabs and the Unions moved in.  So it will work to distract whites from what is going on, for now.</p>
<p>Some people here are criticizing John Stewart, but I saw him do a piece on how these protesters are using the small businesses for their toilets while protesting their existence (apparently), and not patronizing them.  Even SNL last night took a jab at them for blocking the Brooklyn Bridge, &#8220;After all, everyone knows Wall Street Execs want to get over to Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>
<p>What we might note in all this is that the confusion and chaos has begun to manifest in public.  The Obama jobs bills will hire mostly &#8220;minorities,&#8221; you can bet on that.  With job losses and foreclosures increasing for whites more will feel compelled to wonder how this happened to them, when they go to court and see brown faces judging, fining, collecting,and eventually jailing them for vagrancy.  Think that&rsquo;s a wild vision?  Just wait a few more years.</p>

<p>I think we&rsquo;re just seeing the start of this thing.  After they&rsquo;ve given up the latte&rsquo;s and dreams of BMWs, they will next become increasingly aware of what contempt they are held in by the society they thought they had a place in.  It may take a few years, but these guys are going to get tough and really bitter.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my prediction.</p>
<p>Those here who are feeling smug and comfortable may also loose some or most of that comfort as well.  They guy next to you on the line may have a useless degree, but he will be just as angry, maybe more.  As older people, we had a life, for some years, they are being shown they won&rsquo;t have any at all.</p>

<p>Bolshevik means large. &#8220;</p>
<p>Not to nitpick, but we ought to be clear about our terms, as in knowing your enemy;</p>
<p>&#8220;Origins of the name (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>The two factions were originally known as &#8220;hard&#8221; (Lenin&rsquo;s supporters) and &#8220;soft&#8221; (Martov&rsquo;s supporters). Soon, however, the terminology changed to &#8220;Bolsheviks&#8221; and &#8220;Mensheviks&#8221;, from the Russian &#8220;bolshinstvo&#8221; (majority) and &#8220;menshinstvo&#8221; (minority), based on the fact that Lenin&rsquo;s supporters narrowly defeated Martov&rsquo;s supporters on the question of party membership. Neither Lenin nor Martov had a firm majority throughout the Congress as delegates left or switched sides. At the end, the Congress was evenly split between the two factions.</p>
<p>From 1907 on, English language articles sometimes used the term &#8220;Maximalist&#8221; for &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; and &#8220;Minimalist&#8221; for &#8220;Menshevik&#8221;, which proved confusing since there was also a &#8220;Maximalist&#8221; faction within the Russian Socialist-Revolutionary Party in 1904–1906 (which after 1906 formed a separate Union of Socialists-Revolutionaries Maximalists) and then again after 1917.[8]&#8221;</p>
<p>Bolsh is a Russian root word.  So for example, Bolshoi Ballet means Greatest Ballet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not one who commented that these people could overcome us. However, they do have the force and power of the federal government behind them. They may be weak but they have sympathethic people in high places and federal laws in their favaor.</p>

		<p>The protests are organized by moveon.org. </p>
<p> Moveon.org began in 1998 as yet another George Soros front group.  Supposedly a wealthy Berkely Ca couple sent an email to around 300 email contacts asking support to end the focus on Clinton&rsquo;s sex life and perjury and &#8220;Move on&#8221; to more important things.</p>
<p>Actually, commie cannibal capitalist George Soros organized and funded move on.  He had a lot of money he made from the Asian economic crisis to pay for move on.</p>
<p>ACORN SEIU leadership and other hard left wealthy White supporters of Obama are also involved, but it began with move on.<br>
These movements always begin with move on because they are supposedly not political, wealthy and White.</p>
<p>Best bet is that the demonstrations are designed to extort more money out of Wall Street for Obama&rsquo;s re-election campaign.  Wall street and its fellow neo-cons funded Obama&rsquo;s first campaign, but with the economy the way it is, Obama needs vastly more for his second incarnation of our Lord whoever.</p>
<p>Secondarily, the demonstrations allow the Obama worshipping media to blame Wall Street and the banks, not Obama for the current depression.</p>
<p>The communists have been active since 1900.  They are gaining more and more power every day.  There is no, repeat no opposition but for a few hundred thousand Whites who follow amren, CofCC, newtation, stormfront and a few other small organizations.</p>

		<p>Looks like George Soros will look after his minions this winter.</p>
<p><br>
 &#8216;Occupy Wall Street&rsquo; Growing More Organized  Thousands join march  Anti-Wall Street Protests Spread Nationwide <br>
 The cold is coming   &mdash;   and they know it. </p>
<p>As the Occupy Wall Street protesters head into their fourth week, the camp is preparing to dig in for the long haul. Saturday, thoughts were turning to basic human needs and ways to plan and strategize for the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>At Saturday&rsquo;s 9 a.m. coordination meeting, representatives on the numerous task forces dealt with the need for more donations of sleeping bags, ground pads and shoes. Right now there&rsquo;s an oversupply of socks, T-shirts and thermal blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cold is definitely a concern for all of us,&#8221; Olivia Nole-Malpezzi, 18, of Rochester said later. &#8220;We definitely need to prepare for the winter, mentally and physically. Donations are everything to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The challenges aren&rsquo;t deterring one Long Island protester.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important,&#8221; said Roy Sharkey, 51, of St. James. &#8220;I want this to be effective and result in some kind of change. I want to make a statement that&rsquo;s loud and clear and right, for my children,&#8221; said the father of two, a carpenter and part-time musician now on disability.</p>
<p>Also discussed at the coordination meeting were compost, recycling, funding, and expanding the kitchen area to accommodate food donations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re feeding 2,000 people a day and growing but we need to coordinate with sanitation to get the trash out. We&rsquo;re spilling into the areas where people sleep,&#8221; said a kitchen crew representative, who gave her name as Tami.</p>
<p>With numbers swelling, there are concerns the protest may soon outgrow Zuccotti Park, a sliver of open space amid lower Manhattan&rsquo;s canyons.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do get to the point when we reach capacity, we&rsquo;re going to have to look for other venues to legally occupy,&#8221; said Nicole Pace, 23, a Patchogue native now living in Harlem.</p>
<p>How long protesters can occupy the park may depend on the way they manage relationships with neighbors, businesses and the police.</p>
<p>Though there have been complaints of graffiti and bathroom damage from some nearby restaurants and fast-food outlets, store managers interviewed Saturday spoke of an upside   &mdash;   increased business.</p>
<p>Kevin Crossan, general manager of Modell&rsquo;s lower Manhattan store, said his store had requested extra stock of cold-weather clothing, sleeping bags and camping gear.</p>
<p>Hundreds of the protesters embarked Saturday on a 2-mile march through the tony SoHo shopping district to Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. The NYPD said that as of 7:15 p.m. Saturday, no arrests had been made.</p>
<p>Once at the park, the workings of the protest were explained to an audience of more than 2,000, with bystanders encouraged to join the occupation. The second edition of the group&rsquo;s newspaper, The Occupied Wall Street Journal, was handed out. About 25,000 copies of the paper were printed and it also was available in Spanish.</p>
<p>Onlooker Bob Griffith, 49, an Episcopal priest based in Brooklyn, said he was impressed by the occupiers&rsquo; general demeanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s encouraging to me to see this many young people taking part in the democratic process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Eluding to the tumultuous events of the Arab Spring, he added: &#8220;You never know when something is beginning until after the fact &hellip; But we&rsquo;re lucky to be able to do this here. It&rsquo;s exciting.&#8221;<br>

AR posters have noted in previous articles that college degrees have become meaningless. How many companies are going to hire college grads who take courses such as &#8220;Transgender Liberation Theory&#8221;? Consequently, many of these people are unemployable.</p>
<p>If these young kids truly wanted to save the world, they should have taken serious courses in engineering, biology, and chemistry. That way, they could have developed clean, reliable, inexhaustible alternative sources of energy or discovered cures for cancer and AIDS. They want &#8216;clean energy&rsquo; but few of them are willing to invest in an education that would help to build the better world that they say they want. </p>
<p>Instead, they took courses in progressive ideology and now find their college degrees worthless. Many are unemployed because they have no useful, marketable skills.<br>

<p>Unfortunately these White ivy league grads sipping their $5.00 lattes have been funded, organized and are led by ACORN, bill Ayres, Valerie Jarrett and most of all George Soros.</p>
<p>The above groups plucked a clueless useless community organizer out of obscurity and in 11 years rammed him throught the Illinois state senate to the US senate and the presidency.</p>
<p>The lunatic fringe of 1968 were backed by some of the most powerful and wealthiest people, non profit foundations and companies in the country.</p>
<p>The 1968 lunatic fringe now runs the country and has been running it for decades.  This new lunatic fringe is backed by George Soros ACORN.</p>
<p>They will be running the country in 20 years.  The old 1968 hard left is reaching retirement age.  These wall street protestors are their successors.</p>

		<p> You know the reason white folk are on both sides of this affair is we are aware of the financial aspects of the situation. We have a tendency to see ourselves as a part of the process and will wave a protest sign. The minorities as long as they aren&rsquo;t getting discriminated against really don&rsquo;t care what the leadership does as long as they get their largess. We need to cloak white pride in the civil rights movement and when we can do that we will find progressives joining up.</p>

<p>The names came from a single vote during a conference of the unified Russian Social-Democratic Labor Party, which Lenin&rsquo;s faction won a majority of seats on their newspaper editorial-board. </p>
<p>The only firm differences between the two groups was over organization- the Bolsheviks wanted strict guidelines defining party membership, in order to restrict membership to a dedicated &#8220;vanguard&#8221;. The Mensheviks wanted looser rules and thus when the split became permanent, had a larger &#8220;movement&#8221;: if defined by membership, anyway. The Bolsheviks, however, based their strategy on members being able to rally masses of non-members.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>Do you really think all these pathetic, effete leftists (who want to preach marxism while driving BMWs and using I-phones) have ANY of the guts, strength and character needed to enslave YOU?</i></p>
<p>Yes. When they control the judiciary, the military, the government, schools and media they have the strength to enslave us.</p>
<p><i>Let me just say if you&rsquo;re a total invalid, maybe. No, they want a latte, and a cushy existence. They are incapable of violence; they&rsquo;d get slaughtered.</i></p>
<p>They are not incapable of violence to achieve their ends.  They&rsquo;ve used it before and won&rsquo;t hesitate to use it again against those who stand in their way. They are busy dismantling the First Amendment via Hate Speech Laws, along with every other right guaranteed under The Constitution, including the Second Amendment (which protects the others).  See Canada and England for examples of what happens when Hate Speech laws are violated and the population is disarmed.</p>
<p><i>I understand the bitterness, but how on earth does anyone here on AmRen REALLY come to believe that the most wormy, limp whites on the planet are going to muster the sheer physical force needed to enslave their better-minded and infinitely more strong and capable white brethren?</i></p>
<p>Please open your eyes and don&rsquo;t be naive.  We Whites are lorded over by a hostile government that is actively working for our demise. In another generation we will be a minority in the country we Whites founded, surrounded and out-voted in perpetuity by hostile non-Whites who are being primed by the schools and media to thoroughly despise us.  </p>
<p>Whites living in societies run by non-Whites are in physical danger.</p>
<p>The US government continues to allow into our homeland a million 90% non-White LEGAL immigrants a year as 27 million Americans are out of work.  Half of the US population does not pay federal taxes and is on some form of government assistance.  The takers are out-voting and out-breeding the taxpayers.  This is not sustainable. </p>
<p>Our government cares so little for you it refuses to seal the southern border allowing tens of millions of illiterate, backwards, disease-ridden illegal settlers to swarm into the US to set up Third World colonies (come to my home state, California, for an example).  The government then takes the money we earn for ourselves and our families and redistributes it to them   &mdash;   so illegal settlers can have large broods of welfare babies, free educations, medical care, housing AND rights over YOU and YOUR children for college admissions, public scholarships, and jobs. </p>
<p>This is outright government theft of White lands and wealth with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Who was asking why White birthrates are so low?   ~ 1.3 per female, far below the minimum replacement level of 2.1 per female?</p>

<p>You are already enslaved.  Try not paying your taxes or speaking out about White Rights and see what happens.</p>
<p>The following is a comment I wrote last March, entitled &#8220;How They&rsquo;ll Hit Us.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>The government has all kinds of modern weaponry to throw against your rifles and shotguns, weaponry that can atomize large areas, tanks that will roll over you just as surely as they rolled over innocent Chinese in Tiananmen Square, 2,000 of them according to the International Red Cross; the USG will rain hell fire on you from above with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.</i></p>
<p><i>Don&rsquo;t think the USG won&rsquo;t hesitate to turn these weapons on US Citizens who resist the imposition of a NWO, or those considered &#8216;surplus population&rsquo; meaning White Kulaks.</i></p>
<p>The following is what the US Government against Whites in Germany, in Dresden, in 1945, to a defenseless city of men, women and children, and refugees fleeing the Soviet hell state:</p>
<p><i>A terror tactic used by United States Army Air Force was the creation of firestorms. This was achieved by dropping incendiary bombs, filled with highly combustible chemicals such as magnesium, phosphorus or petroleum jelly (napalm), in clusters over a specific target. After the area caught fire, the air above the bombed area, become extremely hot and rose rapidly. Cold air then rushed in at ground level from the outside and people were sucked into the fire.</i></p>
<p>Remember this was carried out on defenseless women, children and refugees.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>I don&rsquo;t mean to offend, but are you serious?</i> </p>
<p>Yes.</p>

		<p>@#24 - Look at all that Jesus accomplished and understand that he wasn&rsquo;t exactly militant or macho. The leftist protesters are a symbol - but not of love or God - of taxable income/assets. The &#8220;spoiled brats&#8221; are either revenue themselves or have parents that are revenue. Most of the &#8220;hard men&#8221; will never be revenue. That goes for the blacks,rednecks,mexicans,working classes etc. My fear - and I&rsquo;m not the poster you replied to - is that the federal government and the military it commands will always choose revenue over honor, self-reliance, integrity etc.</p>
<p>Owning guns,being physically strong,emotional,violent and stupid isn&rsquo;t enough. If you want any government to listen to you - become revenue. Or abolish it&rsquo;s right to tax us all. Good luck with that.</p>

The fatal mistake!  Never underestimate your enemy.    Besides, it&rsquo;s not THEY who would overwhelm you, but their colored masses of henchmen.  (Was Lenin physically prepossessing?  But he went from virtually a nobody to a god.) <br>

I see this constantly on this forum:  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t worry about a tiny few silly leftist wackos.  They are insignificant and they are all crazy anyway. They can&rsquo;t do anything right.&#8221;   Naive  posters like that really upset me.<br>

At this post,  even many &#8220;conservatives&#8221;  desperately insist that  they&rsquo;re not racists, and worship  Saint MLK.   Who&rsquo;s been winning?<br>

<p>[Incidentally, as for those latte-loving, BMW-driving lefties who want a cushy life &hellip;. when I was in Capri  (Italy), a stunningly beautiful place,   I was astounded to learn that Lenin had a villa there   &mdash;    along with the Krupps and other big-shot millionaires.  Capri was his favorite place!  There is even a public library that Lenin donated to the people of the island.  Simply amazing.  Yes, they do like a cushy life  (for themselves),  but that doesn&rsquo;t make them un-dangerous.]<br>

By most measures, Harley-Davidson has been having a rough ride. </p>
<p>Motorcycle sales are falling in 2010, as they have for each of the last three years. The company does not expect a turnaround anytime soon. </p>
<p>But despite that drought, Harley&rsquo;s profits are rising  &mdash;  soaring, in fact. Last week, Harley reported a $71 million profit in the second quarter, more than triple what it earned a year ago&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Many companies are focusing on cost-cutting to keep profits growing, but the benefits are mostly going to shareholders instead of the broader economy, as management conserves cash rather than bolstering hiring and production. Harley, for example, has announced plans to cut 1,400 to 1,600 more jobs by the end of next year. That is on top of 2,000 job cuts last year  &mdash;  more than a fifth of its work force. <br>

The nation&rsquo;s workers may be struggling, but American companies just had their best quarter ever. </p>

What the Wall Street protesters are protesting against is true. The protesters need to stop being arrested. They need to present their arguments in ways economically struggling white people can understand and identify with. The Tea Party demonstrators were not disruptive. They even cleaned up after themselves. <br>
 <br>
The protesters should not be dispirited by the paucity of blacks in their ranks. Most blacks agree with them, even if many feel uncomfortable joining a predominately white movement. </p>

If by &#8220;they&#8221; you mean the oligarchy that owns and runs the United States, I agree with you. Since 1980 real after tax income for 80 percent of the country has declined, while for the richest one percent it has grown dramatically.  <br>

<p>On Friday, after Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) concluded a town hall-style meeting at an old folks&rsquo; home in Concord, New Hampshire, I asked him what he made of the ongoing Occupy Wall Street protests, which have included a noticeable contingency of Paul supporters. On Thursday night, for example, a group of young men assembled at Liberty Plaza in Lower Manhattan were wielding anti-Federal Reserve placards and promoting Paul&rsquo;s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they were demonstrating peacefully,&#8221; Paul told me, &#8220;and making a point, and arguing our case, and drawing attention to the Fed–I would say, good!&#8221;<br>

<p>No, it won&rsquo;t be an American version of the Russian Revolution.  No one claims that.  Nothing in history ever repeats itself precisely.  It will be an American-style  revolution,    or Mexican, or Haitian&hellip;  which have been terrible enough in those places&hellip;.perhaps far more terrible because of the race-hate aspect in it, and all the many races  that will be involved.    And the potential of genocide. </p>
<p>At least the Russians didn&rsquo;t hate one another because of race.  Look instead at South Africa and Zimbabwe today for a hint of the possible future. </p>
<p>No one can predict the future,  but all we can do is learn from history and  take precautions. </p>

<p>#OccupyWallStreet&rsquo;s Racist Speech Rule: White Men Last<br>
 <br>
The Occupy Wall Street movement has adopted racist rules for speech at its nightly &ldquo;General Assembly&rdquo; meetings, according to which white men cannot speak unless preceded by some other type of person.</p>
<p><br>
State your race, gender &amp; sexual orientation, then maybe we&rsquo;ll let you speak. Later.</p>
<p>According to Occupy Wall Street supporter/observer &ldquo;Lori&ldquo;:</p>
<p>Occupy Wall Street&rsquo;s General Assembly operates under a revolutionary &ldquo;progressive stack.&rdquo; A normal &ldquo;stack&rdquo; means those who wish to speak get in line. A progressive stack encourages women and traditionally marginalized groups speak before men, especially white men. This is something that has been in place since the beginning, it is necessary, and it is important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step up, step back&rdquo; was a common phrase of the first week, encouraging white men to acknowledge the privilege they have lived in their entire lives and to step back from continually speaking. This progressive stack has been inspiring and mind-boggling in its effectiveness.</p>

		<p>Some OWSers have legitimate grievances (e.g., folks who were born with debilitating diseases and cannot get health care), but many (most?) are simply whiny kids who are oh-so-shocked that they cannot get a job with their mickey mouse degrees, and are now left with nothing but mountains of student loan debt. Rather than turning themselves around and embracing traditional Germanic values (yes, most of these kids are white and Germanic), they now want handouts to continue the lifestyles that they lived for 4 years in college.</p>
<p>But I strongly disagree with the posters who suggest that we are headed for some sort of &#8220;Russian Revolution&#8221;, or, even more absurdly, that these people are going to be our &#8220;future rulers&#8221;, and that the military is going to enforce their dictates and kill anyone who resists. Unfortunately, these sorts of comments are all-too-common in the official &#8220;racialist&#8221; movement, even in the mode &#8220;moderate&#8221; portions of that movement (Amren, etc.) and it&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t consider myself a part of the movement (even though I do everything I can to promote white and Germanic preservation).</p>
<p>There is no doubt that we live in a fundamentally screwed-up culture which places no importance on traditional values of any kind, let alone Germanic values. But if people here are truly serious about what you preach, separate! You don&rsquo;t even need your own country, create a parallel society here in America. Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s impossible, or that the feds will kill you if you try. It can be done. The Amish have done it, and they&rsquo;re not just surviving, they&rsquo;re thriving. Why don&rsquo;t &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; do it? My guess is that &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; are mostly ivory-tower intellectuals and &#8216;internet warriors&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>A 40-photo Washington Post slideshow showing hundreds of angry protesters in New York and other cities includes no more than 15 clearly identifiable minority protesters, and just six African-Americans. The rest of the protesters shown are white, and most are male.</p>
<p>6 out of 40 is 15%.  That&rsquo;s slightly higher than the percentage of Americans who are black.  In fact, the percentage of people in that photo who are white is 62.5%, which is slightly lower than the national proportion.  I don&rsquo;t see how anyone could see this as an abnormally-white movement.  It actually fits the national demographic makeup far closer than any other movement or political group I can think of.  The numbers simply speak for themselves.</p>
