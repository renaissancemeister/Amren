<h1><a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/oct/26/young-black-men-youth-jails?newsfeed=true">Young Black Men Make Up Four in 10 of Youth Jail Population</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alan Travis, Guardian (London), October 25, 2010</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Young black men now account for nearly 40% of the population of youth jails in England and Wales, according to a report by the chief inspector of prisons.</p>
<p>The report, published jointly with the youth justice board, shows that the proportion of black and other minority ethnic young men in young offender institutions (YOIs) has risen from 23% in 2006 and 33% in 2009/10 to 39% last year.</p>
<p>The changing demographic profile of the population inside youth jails in England and Wales also shows an increasing proportion of young Muslims, up from 13% last year to 16% this year. Foreign national young men account for a record 6% of the population.</p>
<p>The chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, says young people aged 15 to 18 are being held in deteroriating conditions in the YOI network, with fewer feeling safe while they are locked up.</p>
<p>The inspection showed that fewer young inmates felt they could tell someone they were being victimised or believed a member of staff would take them seriously. Only half said they had done something while they were inside that would make them less likely to reoffend in the future.</p>
<p>The report also reveals that more that one-third of the young men had been physically restrained as part of the disciplinary process at their YOI. The highest restraint rate  &mdash;  66%  &mdash;  was at the Keppel unit at Wetherby, which deals with male teenagers who have not responded to a &#8220;normal&#8221; YOI regime. The lowest  &mdash;  8%  &mdash;  was at the Carlford unit near Woodbridge, Suffolk, which holds 30 teenage boys serving long sentences.</p>
<p>The over-representation of young black men in youth jails comes despite a sharp fall in the number of children and young people in custody that has already led to the closure of five YOIs, including a specialist unit for young women.</p>
<p>The total population of the youth justice &#8220;secure estate&#8221;, which includes eight male YOIs and three specialist units for girls and young women, continued to fall from 1,977 in March 2010 to 1,822 this March, before this summer&rsquo;s riots.</p>
<p>Hardwick says, however, that the number of black and minority ethnic children in custody has not fallen at the same rate as the number of white children being locked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Between 2007 and 2011 there was a 37% reduction in white children in custody, compared with a 16% reduction in black and ethnic minority children,&#8221; says the report.</p>
<p>The report does not discuss the reasons why young black people make up an ever greater proportion of the shrinking youth jail population. But Hardwick does note that an increasing number  &mdash;  53% now, compared with 39% last year  &mdash;  of young men are being sent to prison for the first time.</p>
<p>Hardwick said: &#8220;This report has highlighted some deterioration in children and young people&rsquo;s experience of custody. Despite the falling numbers, this population has well-defined vulnerability and increasing numbers within minority groups. The need, therefore, to provide these people with support during their time in custody and in preparation for their release is as great as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances Done, the chair of the youth justice board, which commissions places in youth prisons, said it would be working with all secure establishments to make sure that young people&rsquo;s time in custody has positive results.</p>
<p>The inspection was based on the experience of 1,115 young men and 47 young women in YOIs and specialist units.</p>

<p>Most of that increase happened when Labour was in power.  I wonder if the ASBO had anything to do with it.</p>

		<p>So, if you combine the numbers of blacks with the numbers of muslims, it is evident that ethnic White Britons make up an actual minority of young offenders.<br>
 Most likely this pattern will be repeated through the generations and hold with adult offenders.<br>
 The remarkable fact is that a mass non-White population has only really existed in Britain for 50 years.It only took a couple of generations for the true face of third world immigration to show itself in Britain - and the politicians claimed this immigration was done to &#8216;boost&rsquo; Britain.</p>

		<p>Extremely high rates of crime and violence - and subsequent incarceration - are a universal characteristic of all black communities. This is true everywhere on the face of the planet earth where blacks exist in any numbers. In fact it is the defining trademark of black population groupings. </p>

<p>That would be due to the fact that they are committing offences, breaking the law and getting caught. The greater proportion is due to the fact that there are more blacks in the UK than ever before. Elementary.</p>

<p>WHY black people make up a greater proportion of the jail population? They don&rsquo;t know yet? BECAUSE they are BLACK, you fools. Also those &#8220;first timers&#8221;,has since reached the age (oh say, about 11 years old) to become first time criminals. Could that be the reason, Hardwick? </p>
<p>Looks like they are wringing their hands over WHY so many blacks (just like in the USA) are incarcerated when the answer is so obvious. Now they will implement more programs to &#8220;help&#8221; these cretins, costing the taxpayers even more while the only solution is deportation and a stop to all nonwhite immigration into their country.</p>
<p>But, of course White societies are just too &#8220;civilized&#8221; and progressive to have any common sense left or any sort of racial awareness intact that once kept our nations WHITE.</p>

		<p>The Brits (and many others) have accused the US for being racist for decades.  Now they are getting a taste of our medicine.  We just didn&rsquo;t wake up one day and decide that blacks were a major liability to our nation.  We experience &#8216;diversity&rsquo; and special rights in government, media, academia and entertainment.</p>

<p>If I am reading this halfway correctly at least, it&rsquo;s telling me that the criminals are &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and that they should be &#8220;provided with support&#8221;&hellip;.yada yada yada.</p>
<p>Once again, it&rsquo;s never a minority&rsquo;s FAULT when THEY commit the crime and get punished.  They&rsquo;re just VULNERABLE and need SUPPORT.  Oh.  My.  Gah.</p>

This story of &#8220;The Guardian&#8221; is so badly written that it is difficult to understand if your interprétation is wright - one has to add 39% of &#8220;black and other minorities&#8221; to 16% muslims, so it is 55% - or if one has to understand 39% of which 16% are muslims. The &#8220;Guardian&#8221; is supposed to be a good newspaper&hellip; When it&rsquo;s about race, even the newspaper who are supoposed to be good are utterly bad&hellip; </p>

<p>No, read it more carefully.  </p>
<p>&#8220;The report, published jointly with the youth justice board, shows that the proportion of black and other minority ethnic young men in young offender institutions (YOIs) has risen from 23% in 2006 and 33% in 2009/10 to 39% last year.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this article, &#8220;black&#8221; means all non-whites, which is a common usage in the UK.  </p>

		<p>As the percentage of young people being locked up declines, only the most dangerous young people are being put behind bars.  Blacks are more violent, so as the standards for incarceration change, the percentage of blacks vs. whites incarcerated changes along with it.</p>
<p>White boys in the USA have known for many years that getting locked up in juvenile detention is going to be very bad for a white boy, because the blacks are going to victimize him repeatedly.  White boys in the U.K. are no doubt figuring this out, too.</p>
