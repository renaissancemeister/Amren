<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Herman Cain&rsquo;s campaign Sunday branded a Politico story on accusations of sexual harassment Cain faced in the 1990s as nothing more than a partisan attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fearing the message of Herman Cain who is shaking up the political landscape in Washington, Inside the Beltway media have begun to launch unsubstantiated personal attacks on Cain,&#8221; spokesman J. D. Gordon said in a statement about the former Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza CEO.</p>
<p>Gordon said the Politico piece centered on &#8220;thinly sourced allegations&#8221; relying more on rumors than fact. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cain has never sexually harassed anyone  &mdash;  period,&#8221; Cain chief of staff Mark Block said during an MSNBC interview Monday morning.</p>
<p>The Politico story claimed at least two female employees complained about sexually suggestive behavior from Cain while he served as head of the National Restaurant Association. The group reportedly paid out five-figure separation packages to the accusers. Cain&rsquo;s camp has not denied outright that Cain has been accused of harassment or that the incidents led to financial settlements.</p>
<p>The allegations included suggestive conversations and physical gestures, according to Politico:</p>
<blockquote>The sources  &mdash;  which include the recollections of close associates and other documentation  &mdash;  describe episodes that left the women upset and offended. These incidents include conversations allegedly filled with innuendo or personal questions of a sexually suggestive nature, taking place at hotels during conferences, at other officially sanctioned restaurant association events and at the association&rsquo;s offices. There were also descriptions of physical gestures that were not overtly sexual but that made women who experienced or witnessed them uncomfortable and that they regarded as improper in a professional relationship.</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gordon told Politico Sunday that Cain indicated to staff that he was &#8220;vaguely familiar&#8221; with the charges and that he was aware the restaurant association&rsquo;s general counsel had resolved the matter.</p>

		<p>Like these things usually turn out, the truth is somewhere between nothing and the media accusations.  If it is, then it is still uncouth behavior on the part of a married man.  And I think there has to be something there, just because there was a five figure settlement.  </p>
<p>While I don&rsquo;t think Cain was going to win the Republican nomination anyway, I think this revelation will create enough uncertainty and doubt about him so that his nomination will be impossible now.  As it is, it seems to me the big Republican money was coalescing behind Romney.  Short term beneficiary of Cain&rsquo;s fall is the Rickroller, and there is your &#8220;Cui Bono&#8221; suspect on who leaked this info to the Politico.</p>
<p>Ron Paul had the best response of all the Republican candidates, saying that he&rsquo;s not going to make hay of this, instead focusing on Cain&rsquo;s support for TARP and the Federal Reserve, and his troubling history with the Fed.  My response is still the same:  That, his time with the N.R.A. mentioned in this article should raise immigration questions, and a white country should not have a black President, period.  My opinion of Cain has not changed.  I wasn&rsquo;t going to vote for him before this, and I&rsquo;m not voting for him after this.</p>

<p>BTW, this sounds like a perfect description of every convention I have ever attended:  </p>
<p>&#8220;episodes that left the women upset and offended. These incidents include conversations allegedly filled with innuendo or personal questions of a sexually suggestive nature, taking place at hotels during conferences, at other officially sanctioned restaurant association events and at the association&rsquo;s offices.

		<p>I have to admit that it really does sound a lot like the Clarence Thomas &#8216;affair&rsquo;; maybe a little too conveniently for the Democrats.</p>
<p>This may help save foolish conservatives/white people from themselves. If they have a way to opt out of voting for him because of this, they won&rsquo;t have to vote for another black man to give blacks &#8216;one more chance&rsquo;. They can feel relieved that they have a tangible reason to vote for a white man this time, without a racial angle.</p>
<p>The only question left is where the women white.</p>

		<p>	Herman Cain&rsquo;s record at Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza, One recent article reports &ldquo;Cain has released no earnings statements either during the time he was at Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza or since. If we look at sales figures which are in the public record, sales at Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza, adjusted for inflation dropped over 40% from the year before he took over to his final years. It is hard to imagine that profits went up at this time. Godfather&rsquo;s Pizza fell from the 5th largest Pizza chain when Cain took over to the 11th largest Pizza chain by the time he left the company 15 years later.&rdquo;<br>

	Probable affirmative action hire, who has failed on many accounts.<br>

		<p>The Republicans can&rsquo;t produce a charismatic candidate once more, and just like past elections they&rsquo;ll have to settle for a  McCain, Bush, Dole, etc.  None of them are especially articulate in an effective way either.  Romney can speak well, but he&rsquo;s too much of a panty waist and is afraid to tell it like it is.</p>
<p>Gingrich might come the closest to having the ability to breathe the necessary fire, but I doubt the Republican rank and file will vote for him.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s blasphemous for a Republican to get mad and come right out and tell it like it is.  Karl Rove and the party leadership want deadhead dregs who would never consider raising their voices in anger.</p>

		<p>Notice how the women were paid off and the chief of staff said Cain never did this.  This was deliberate so no one can call Cain a liar.  If irrefutable evidence comes out Cain can say, &#8220;I never said that, my chief of staff did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Did he do it?  Probably.</p>
<p>Do I care?  No.  I am voting for Ron Paul anyways.  Cain is a neo con that is not much different from Obama.  The only difference is Obama will get all the black vote regardless.</p>
<p>As of right now if the GOP runs Perry, Bachman, or Cain it will mean 4 more years of Obama.  Of course this might change within the next year.</p>

		<p>Notice how Coulter, Limbaugh and others are madly defending Cain.<br>
I click on Fox sometimes.  Every time I have for the last week it has been Cain, Cain, Cain.</p>
<p>They refuse to face the facts that it is not unproved allegations.  There was a settlement.  The plaintiff&rsquo;s had to have soem verifiable facts for defandant&rsquo;s attorneys to agree to a settlement.</p>
<p>The National Restaurant Association is not some mom and pop store that would agree to pay $10,000 over a 3 year period because they could not come up with $6,000 to defend the suit.</p>
<p>An organization like that can afford to defend unfounded lawsuits.  First thing a defense attorney does in a suit is file a demurrer to dismiss the suit as without merit.</p>
<p>The Judge ruled that there was enough cause to allow the suit to go forward.  Then both sides agreed to settle.</p>
<p>If there was no merit, there would not have been a settlement, the lawsuit would hve been dismissed as without merit.</p>
<p>Fox seems to be a Republican party front.  Seems like the party has decided on Cain.  Won&rsquo;t it be wonderful, 2 black men running for President.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Chinese are buying up the west coast, and New York. Muslims are buying up N. Virginia, and other non White immigrants are buying up the financial sector, retail and what is left of industry.<br>

		<p>Well something happened. Why else would there be financial settlements? My guess would be the ladies were White. Did Mr. Cain being in a position of authority over them revert to behavior so typical of Africans in such situations? Sexual harassment or worse seems to be the usual outcome in these scenarios with the African being unable or unwilling to control his sexual urges.<br>

		<p>I rather doubt that Cain did anything improper.  The payment of a settlement, however, means little or nothing even if true.</p>
<p>These are normally engineered by the defendant&rsquo;s insurance company and are often in no way an admission of guilt.  Rather, the insurer makes a simple business decision that it&rsquo;s cheaper to settle than to incur legal fees in defending their policy holder, however baseless the claim may be.</p>

		<p>This sounds like garbage, and probably is. Nothing about these accusations sound like truly harmful or threatening behavior, nor gross exploitation of position. The aspects of Political Correctness driven by feminism have made so much of typical male behavior off-limits: producing the natural feminist conclusion that all men are guilty of offenses against women. </p>
<p>Black males are generally able to get away with much more &#8220;masculine&#8221; behavior than white males, because they too have their own PC protections (see &#8220;To Kill a Mockingbird&#8221;). HOWEVER, Cain is in the risky position of being an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; in the eyes of many influential Blacks. Essentially he has taken &#8220;acting White&#8221; much to far, to the point he is seen as a traitor to his race and the &#8220;progressive&#8221; coalition as a whole. </p>
<p>So, as he seems to have no problems with grading himself according to the white standard, his opposition sees it fit to judge him according to the white standard also.</p>
<p>He probably understood this, and paid out his money to cover his bum: as countless successful whites have tried to do. That doesn&rsquo;t make the accusations serious: rather, it attests to the absurdity of feminist PC demands.</p>
<p>Accusations like this immensely devalue serious cases of sexual harassment and abuse of position. &#8220;Empowerment&#8221; is once again shown to be a sham: it means claiming harm to prompt a shakedown. Very different from commanding respect as an equal. </p>

		<p>The way &#8216;conservatives&rsquo; have reacted to this story is embarrassing. Their most common response yesterday was to accuse liberals or the media of being &#8216;racist&rsquo;. Sorry, but publishing a story about a candidate&rsquo;s involvement with sexual harassment suits is not a &#8216;lynching&rsquo; or &#8216;racist&rsquo;, and any true conservative knows that. It is a legit story.</p>
<p>Nobody besides Cain and his accusers knows exactly what happened, but is clear that Cain lied yesterday about the settlements, before later reversing himself. (&#8216;I&rsquo;m not aware of any settlements&hellip;ok I am, but my lawyer told me they were small&rsquo;) That does not exactly bode well in my book. </p>

		<p>When I was 19 I was asked by a 20 something waitress to intervene on her behalf because the over 50 Black manager was pretty much doing all this and more to her . The guys response was that it was all harmless. I asked him how he could say that when she was mad enough to get me to make him stop cause she couldn`t. Not a lick of shame or embaressment or promise to desist. I forget what happened to her but he was fired for &#8220;borrowing&#8221; so much money from delivery men that they would refuse to come until after he had left for the day. The owner found out when he called up wondering why his meat, liquor and dry goods were starting to show up after 5pm and not before 11 am&hellip;</p>

In my life time I have known over 100 Black men.  All of them operated on a different sexual moral code than the Christian moral code. The Western Christian sexual moral code does not govern all White men, but is does certainly govern a vast majority.  </p>
<p>Adultery is considered wrong by almost all White men.  This is not the case with Black men or women.  Black men are always trying to get sexual favors from women, and thanks to the Civil Rights Revolution Black men can prey freely on White women.</p>
<p>The White race has spent hundreds of generations developing courting rituals that hold off sexual intercourse until after marriage.  Blacks have only lived in the White man&rsquo;s land for less than 15 generations and with no real check on their evolutionary successful African mating practices.   Black men&rsquo;s courting ritual is different than ours.  They do not go out on date, hold hands, and get a goodnight kiss.  They make lewd proposals    </p>
<p>To believe that Clearance Thomas or Herman Cain would not make lewd proposals to women you would have to be an ignoramus about Black men.  </p>
<p>An episode from a TV crime show captured the difference in Black and White mating practices.  It is a true story of how the Cleveland, Ohio police caught two murderers.</p>
<p>Two Black youths were cutting across a vacant lot on a Sunday morning.  Another Black man crossed their path.  The two killed the Black man then took his money and cell phone.  The killer use the cell phone to call his girl friend to tell her he had just killed a man and would soon be over for sex.</p>
<p>Now transport that event 300 years back in time.  Two natives encounter another native from a different tribe.  They kill him and return to the village as heroes and engages in sex with one or more of the tribe females.  </p>
<p>We cannot expect Black men to undo thousands of years of genetic programming in 300 years.  <br>

		<p>Cain was president of the National Restaurant Association.</p>
<p>Restaurants are the biggest employers of illegal aliens, even more than argiculture.  The big chains such as Burger King have 800 numbers in mexico and central america. Except for a few chefs, even the high end restaurants are no Whites need apply.</p>
<p>The restaurant association also spends millions every year lobbying for more and more hispanic illegal immigration and the multitude of benefits that enables their low wage employees to raise 3 or 4 children in nice middle class sec 8 homes along with the food stamps and the rest of the taxpayers money that subdizes the low wage restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Restaurants and the food industry are well funded enemies of Whites.  We have to eat, but we do not have to go to restaurants. </p>
<p>Any person who was a manager in the food industry is our enemy.</p>

		<p>People here dont understand how corporations work. At the time lawyers would have advised to settle out of court rather than go into a long drawn out court case and get all that NEGATIVE publicity that would affect SALES. Those of us who actually work in the Free Market will understand this basic LOGICAL fact. Im sorry but there is no &#8220;typical black man&#8221; stuff here or petty racial points to be scored through attacking Cain on this.</p>

<p>Had there not been some merit to the allegations the suit would have been dismissed before any settlement discussions.</p>
<p>This suit was in the 1990&rsquo;s.  By that time feminazis were no longer allowed to charge sexual harassement because &#8220;he looked at me and I felt uncomfortable.&#8221;  In the 1980&rsquo;s some of the sexual harassement suits were ridiculous.  But by the time this one came along there had to be some speech or actions to allow the suit to go forward instead of being dismissed at the demurrer hearing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been harassed by black men ever since I went off to college.  Sexual harassement and offensive language are just a black thing. </p>

		<p>A settlement is a clear indication of some liability, or the probability that a jury will find for the plaintiff multiplied by the probable amount of the awarded damages. Sure other factors are also included to determine settlement amounts such as legal costs and the hassle of defending. If Cain had a good name to clear he should disclose the amount of the settlement. If it was large, be sure that he feared liability.</p>

		<p>Whatever Cain did or didn&rsquo;t do, it was serious enough such that he would be a lot better off today if he didn&rsquo;t do it.  Especially since he was President of the National Restaurant Association at the time - Whatever he says and does to other people will be interpreted as the entire N.R.A. saying and doing it.  When you&rsquo;re a CEO of something, as he was, this is something he should have understood instinctively. And he wants us to hire him as the CEO of the American Federal government.</p>
<p>This all speaks to one of my pet peeves, and something I avoid as much as I can and as studiously as the plague:  Office politics.  Work is a place to do work, not to form cliques and gossip.  To the untrained eye, some of the rules and regulations that companies have about employee behavior seem abusive and heavy handed, but all they&rsquo;re trying to do is cut down of office politics, as they always drag down productivity.  One example is not allowing employees to discuss their salary or compensation packages with other employees - I think the reason for that regulation is to cut down on jealousy and hard feelings.  Someone will get jealous of someone else for making more than they do, when there&rsquo;s probably a perfectly good reason for that that is not their business.  But it leads to hard feelings, gossip and more office politics, which lead to less work getting done.</p>
<p>If I had my way, workplace gossiping would be a capital offense.  Then again, I really wouldn&rsquo;t want my way, because women are too important to execute.  Really, men aren&rsquo;t that much better in that regard.</p>

<p>BTW, I don&rsquo;t know where to put this, but I saw last week on CNN!! that Jesse Jackson is in Sweden promoting Diversity.  This while Sweden is debating the future of African/Muslim immigration in the face of reported (!) difficulties with immigrants and asylum seekers in crime and other social misbehaving.  They didn&rsquo;t mention the high rapes stats, but they did interview comments by leaders and individual Swedes who said that Sweden &#8220;not longer feels like home to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I bet that Je$$e Jackson is there getting some of that Swedish &#8220;Diversity&#8221; for himself.</p>

<p>Cain IS a race hustler.  Though not as obvious or ridiculous as Jesse and Al.  Notice how quickly he played the race card when this scandal made it to the surface, and notice how quickly lamestream conservatives did the same, even though they bemoan Jesse and Al doing it.</p>
<p>One more bromide of which I&rsquo;m getting sick - this lamestream conservative notion that the media/left/Democrats are &#8220;out to destroy&#8221; a conservative (quote unquote) black because they fear that blacks will leave the Democrat plantation (quote unquote).  That will never happen, simply because the Democrats will always be the party of more welfare than the Republicans, no matter who the Republicans nominate.  If, for example, Obama bows out tomorrow, the Democrats nominate HRC, and Cain wins the Republican nomination, almost all blacks will vote for HRC.</p>

		<p>He got his job at Burger King courtesy of Jesse Jackson&rsquo;s settlement with that company reached 17 March 1983. Why would someone in a background in mainframe computers take a job in fast food? He may not have been as successful as you think: Pillsbury didn&rsquo;t try very hard to keep him in Minneapolis, did they?</p>
<p>As far as what happened with Godfather&rsquo;s, I think Cain has created quite a legend considering his LBO with other executives was for about 10% of what the chain had cost Diversified Foods. Godfather&rsquo;s fell from fourth to eighth during Cain&rsquo;s tenure. A lot of the credit Cain now claims for himself he once gave to his predecessor, &#8220;Pete&#8221; Pettis, who was responsible for mending relationships with franchisees. </p>
<p>You can google it  yourself: May 7, 1986, Jordon, Steve, and Batson, Bill, Godfather&rsquo;s Selects Chicago Advertising Firm, Omaha World-Herald (NE). Or find Jay Raskin&rsquo;s blog at wordpress. He&rsquo;s done a lot of homework piecing together the pieces of Cain&rsquo;s narrative, and it answers a lot of the questions I had about why Cain would end up in fast food (come on, Godfather&rsquo;s is NOT a success story; Papa John&rsquo;s was started in this time frame and has far and away eclipsed what Godfather&rsquo;s ever was) if he was really a big-wig in computers.<br>

<p>Herman Cain Has a Powerful Enemy in Iowa[Hard-Core Evangelical Christian Host]<br>

<p>The harassment scandal highlights Cain&rsquo;s rift with Iowa&rsquo;s most dangerous conservative talker. Herman Cain has messed with the wrong Iowan. </p>
<p>One strand of the multifaceted scandal unfolding around the Republican presidential candidate this week has been the charge that Cain treated female staffers of Des Moines-based radio host Steve Deace in a manner Deace found &#8220;awkward and inappropriate.&#8221; </p>
<p>While Deace has refused to describe the interaction that prompted that characterization, he has also spent the week relentlessly pounding Cain on his nightly talk show   &mdash;   and taking to task the conservatives who, at least at first, largely defended the former&hellip;</p>

		<p>He asked the plaintiff to come to his hotel room during a convention.  She reported it immediatly.  </p>
<p>Sources reveal new details about Cain allegation<br>
By Kenneth P. Vogel, Maggie Haberman, Alexander Burns </p>
<p> Politico Wed, Nov 2, 2011</p>
<p>Herman Cain flatly denies the most serious allegation facing him – that he made an unwanted sexual advance toward a female employee at a work event – but POLITICO has learned new details making clear there were urgent discussions of the woman&rsquo;s accusations at top levels of the National Restaurant Association within hours of when the incident was alleged to have occurred.</p>
<p>The new details &mdash; which come from multiple sources independently familiar with the incident at a hotel during a restaurant association event in the late 1990s &mdash; put the woman&rsquo;s account even more sharply at odds with Cain&rsquo;s emphatic insistence in news media interviews this week that nothing inappropriate happened between the two.</p>
<p>In recent days sources &mdash; including associates of the woman and people familiar with operations of the restaurant association &mdash; have offered new details of the incident.</p>
<p>The woman in question, roughly 30 years old at the time and working in the National Restaurant Association&rsquo;s government affairs division, told two people directly at the time that Cain made a sexual overture to her at one of the group&rsquo;s events, according to the sources familiar with the incident. She was livid and lodged a verbal complaint with an NRA board member that same night, these sources said.</p>
<p>The woman told one of the sources Cain made a suggestion that she felt was overtly sexual in nature and that &ldquo;she perceived that her job was at risk if she didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a pretty confident individual, and she was pretty upset,&rdquo; the source, an acquaintance of the woman, said of her demeanor after the encounter with Cain. &ldquo;Not crying, but angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She described it as an &ldquo;unwanted sexual advance&rdquo; to the other source. The woman took the matter immediately and directly to the board member because &ldquo;she wanted this fixed,&rdquo; the source said.</p>
<p>POLITICO has learned the accusation was also later brought to the attention of another board member as well as the restaurant association&rsquo;s general counsel Peter Kilgore, both of whom are said to have looked into the matter. The woman, who now works in New Jersey, left the NRA in May 1998, shortly after the incident  &mdash;  under an agreement that paid her one-year&rsquo;s salary, in the mid-$30,000s, sources said. The amount of the settlement was first reported by the New York Times.</p>
<p>She said at the time that she left because &ldquo;she was not getting along with her bosses,&rdquo; said another source, a former NRA employee who knew her.</p>
<p>POLITICO has spoken to more than six sources familiar with aspects of the woman&rsquo;s story. Cain&rsquo;s campaign this week did not respond to repeated calls and emails seeking comment on the new details related to the woman&rsquo;s claim. Kilgore also has declined to comment, saying he cannot discuss personnel matters.</p>
<p>POLITICO first reported the existence of the woman&rsquo;s allegations on Sunday, and that she received a financial payout when she left the organization in 1998. POLITICO shared her name with Cain several days before publication, but, along with other news organizations that have learned her identity, has not publicly identified her for privacy reasons.</p>
<p>In that story, POLITICO described a second woman who left the NRA after making sexual harassment allegations against Cain. That woman received about $45,000 as part of her settlement.</p>
<p>Cain, in public comments over the past few days, has said he is unaware of any formal complaints beyond the one he has discussed in public – which relates to the second woman who received a $45,000 settlement. That woman&rsquo;s lawyer is now negotiating with the National Restaurant Association over possibly releasing a statement from the woman.</p>
<p>In an interview with Greta van Susteren on Fox News Monday, Cain described the first woman, who is the subject of this story, as &ldquo;a longer-term employee&rdquo; who &ldquo;worked in our governmental affairs department and she worked in the function that managed our political action committee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cain said he didn&rsquo;t see her much, beyond &ldquo;casually running into her, like I would run into everybody&rdquo; in the association&rsquo;s Washington office. And he asserted: &ldquo;I have no knowledge that she made a formal complaint or accusation or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cain also said Tuesday on Fox News that he is &ldquo;absolutely sure&rdquo; he didn&rsquo;t ask the women that were the subject of the POLITICO story to come to his hotel room.</p>
<p>But the sources describe how the woman recounted her allegations against Cain to two members of the restaurant association&rsquo;s board – sources who include an acquaintance of the woman&rsquo;s and a person who attended the restaurant association meeting at which the woman lodged her complaint.</p>
<p>The sources say the woman told them Cain invited her to his hotel room at the event, and that both the context and the way Cain phrased the invitation made her feel extremely uncomfortable, even incensed.</p>
<p>After her complaint, Kilgore – who is still serving as the association&rsquo;s legal counsel today – found out about it and looked into it, according to someone familiar with the association.</p>
<p>Yet, about 10 association board members serving at the time said they were never told of any investigation – or even complaints against Cain.</p>
<p>He resigned as president of the NRA effective June 30, 1999, before his three-year term was up, yet these board members say they were never fully informed as to why. None said they believed his departure had anything to do with the allegations made by the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My understanding is that he decided that he did not want to [be CEO] anymore – whether it was for some kind of personal issue, I did not know what they were,&rdquo; said Ron Magruder, who chaired the association&rsquo;s board at the time of Cain&rsquo;s departure. Magruder told POLITICO he never heard complaints about Cain&rsquo;s treatment of female employees, adding &ldquo;I have no reason to question his ethics or integrity in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cain told van Susteren he never had an inappropriate conversation with any female workers in his hotel room, but he also said of the woman, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall having a private conversation with her. But all of the conversations that I had, it could have been. But I don&rsquo;t recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman recently told her new employer that an embarrassing story might soon break involving her and a GOP presidential candidate. POLITICO initially reached the woman on the phone about two weeks ago, when she declined to comment, and has not been able to reach her since then.</p>

<p>The unidentified woman, who worked for Cain at the National Restaurant Association in the mid-1990s, strongly rejected Cain&rsquo;s version of events that he was falsely accused of sexual harassment, her lawyer, Joel Bennett, told reporters.</p>

I rather doubt that Cain did anything improper. The payment of a settlement, however, means little or nothing even if true.</p>
<p>These are normally engineered by the defendant&rsquo;s insurance company and are often in no way an admission of guilt.</p>
<p>Yes they are an admission of guilt.  I am involved in a medical malpractice lawsuit as plaintiff right now.  My medical insurance company will go after the hospital and Drs for the comlete cost of my care after the malpractice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll get a small settlement.  My insurance company will use that as an admission of faulty medical care.  Then the insurance company will go after the hospital for all the money they had to spend and will spend in the future for the injuries done to me by the defendant&rsquo;s malpractice.<br>

<p>All of you have definitely done yeoman&rsquo;s work on this Cain question.  A rational reasonable person would have to conclude that Cain&rsquo;s behavior was definitely inappropriate.  Any decent political pundit would have to conclude that even if the truth of the scandal never comes and and doesn&rsquo;t end his political career, the FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) will eventually take its toll, though it will take a few weeks for it to show up in the polling data.</p>
<p>But I get the feeling that all this, not only with Cain, but this whole Republican primary and caucus pre-season, has been a ruse.  I&rsquo;m going to get to my point right away.</p>
<p>On January 21, 2013 (see footnote), on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., you will hear the words, &#8220;I, Willard Mitt Romney, do solemnly swear&hellip;&#8221; being said.  We should really stop deluding ourselves.  By that, I mean I should stop deluding myself.  I&rsquo;m a political junkie, but I also have enough gray hairs above my ears, and I&rsquo;m a well versed student in recent American political history, such that I should have known better all along.</p>
<p>Romney won this nomination because he could do what none of his competitors could, that is, held his index finger on his nose and walked a ten foot straight line.  Translate that metaphor into English, and he merely engaged in an inverse utilitarian strategy of P.O.-ing as few people off as possible and the least often, relative to the other candidates.  He had the most name recognition, from his 2008 run, he had the most money, which he turned into more name rec.  He beat Obama because the economy remained in its near depressive or severe recessive state through 2012.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m already writing the future as the past.  Presumptive?  Yes.  But again, too many gray hairs and too much the student of history to think otherwise.</p>
<p>Think I&rsquo;m kidding?  Look at this:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/lVg6W" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/lVg6W</a></p>
<p>Romney is trashing the Rickroller&rsquo;s immigration record, in Iowa.  Now, Romney is a total phony about it, but he&rsquo;s the only one in this race with (A) Enough resources, and at the same time (B) Acting like he wants to win.  We&rsquo;re two months away from Iowa almost to the day, and now is the final back stretch where money really separates the men from the boys.</p>
<p>Prediction:  Even before the Iowa caucuses, the other candidates will either tap out or become non-factors.</p>
<p>We should follow Jack in Chicago&rsquo;s strategy of focusing on downballot and local matters.</p>
<p>Footnote:  January 20, 2013 is on a Sunday.  Romney will legally be sworn in on noon that day, but the formal ceremony will take place the next day. </p>
