			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Hoye, CNN, October 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At first, a Philadelphia landlord said, he thought one of his tenants was attempting to conceal a dog after finding a dog dish in the basement of his apartment building.</p>
<p>But on a return trip to the basement Saturday, Turgut Gozleveli found something much more sinister: four mentally disabled people held captive, including one man chained to a radiator.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Three people have been arrested and accused of holding the people captive and stealing their Social Security checks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The alleged victims include a 29-year-old woman and three men, ages 31, 35 and 41, said Philadelphia police Lt. Ray Evers.</p>
<p>All seven  &mdash;  the three suspects and four alleged victims  &mdash;  had been traveling together, he said, but did not know for how long. Weston is believed to have been in McLean, Texas, with some or all of the alleged victims. They then traveled to Florida and Philadelphia, Evers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The four were in a room roughly 10 feet by 15 feet, Gozleveli said, and looked malnourished and disheveled. They had a metal bucket and a jug of what appeared to be orange juice, but no food. They also had pillows and blankets, but didn&rsquo;t know where they were or where they had come from, he said.</p>
<p>Authorities believe the four were trapped in the tiny room for up to a week. Evers said they suffered from bed sores and &#8220;injuries that are very, very hard to describe.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>They are just like the black couple that adopted a lot of children, kept them out of school,and starved them so much that one of them was 19 years old but weighed only 45 pounds. You may remember that case.They did it just to collect checks.</p>

		<p>When someone told me about this story from the newspaper today, I wondered whether race might have played a role, considering the city in which it took place, but of course the story chose to conceal this information, just as the one above does. Of course, if the races had been reversed, it would have been featured very prominently in the story. The liberals&rsquo; screams of &#8220;Race is not relevant to the story!!&#8221; never hold true in the relatively rare instances of white on black crimes.</p>

		<p>One day after my Kleenex and Rolaids run to the nursing home my Dad said he wanted to talk to me. He went on to tell me he was &#8220;The richest man in the complex&hellip;&#8221;. The greed light in my eyes must have shone thru a Corvette on my retina, cause he then cuffed me on the side of the head. &#8220;It` not about money! It`s because my boy makes a deposit twice a day in the only currency of value here. Kid visits&hellip;.&#8221; <br>
 He then went on to say that while other Seniors were bragging about a physician son in Des Moines, his was here watching Wheel of Fortune.  Thought I`d pass that bit of wisdom along to anyone facing the situation.  You might not be lucky enough to live in the same town as an elderly parent but 15 minutes a day beats a whole weekend at Christmas&hellip;.And it keeps this stuff at bay as a bonus&hellip; </p>

		<p>Par for the course. I can&rsquo;t count the times I have read where blacks do this type of thing to steal social security checks. They closed such a black run home here a year ago. The black &#8220;caregiver&#8221; raped for over a year or more, a severely mentally challenged teenage girl (White of course) </p>
<p>Wonder if the disabled were White in this story? </p>
<p>Never trust ANY black to care for anyone.  Children, the disabled, the mentally/physically challenged, the elderly, pets or anyone else that is at their mercy and too weak to fight them off and RUN!</p>

		<p>So let me get this right, when blacks have the power they have absolutely no problem with slavery.  We have seen that most of the reported incidents of modern day slavery are perpetrated by blacks or other non-whites.  The &#8220;stays with&#8221; slave kids in Haiti.  Plain old fashioned slaves in the Sudan.  Sex slaves all over the planet.  Wake up people and start really studying the history of the world.  The white race has led the world in improving the lot of mankind.  </p>

		<p>Here in White NW Philly, I play a little game with my roommates/friends, all of whom, sadly, are very liberal. Flip on the local news, see a crime story, predict the race of the perps. I&rsquo;ve NEVER been wrong, and it ticks the buds off to no end. Surely most regulars here have developed similar &#8220;blackdar&#8221; capabilities.</p>
<p>Callous savagery, brutal, predatory indifference, and scamming for government gibs&hellip; Even in (still) White NE Philly- Yup, It&rsquo;s gotta be blacks! </p>

		<p>Tim Mc Hugh makes a good point.  I&rsquo;ve volunteered in care centers over the years and have observed that even under the best circumstances of care the residents who have frequent visitors are better treated by staff.  Never know when someone is going to drop in&hellip;</p>
<p>I have also observed and heard reports of some staff asking mentally impaired people for their watches, etc. One place I visited regularly I reported to the charge nurse of an incident I knew of and was told that it was just playful teasing.</p>
<p>Since she and the perp shared a culture I took it one step higher up the chain of command. The next day the man was no longer employed and no person of color who worked there ever spoke to me again.  Made me wonder how much &#8220;playful teasing&#8221; I had actually interferred with.</p>
