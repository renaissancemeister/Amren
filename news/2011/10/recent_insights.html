	<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW:</p>
<p>This study reviews recent insights into racial differences in bone from 2010 to 2011.</p>
<p>RECENT FINDINGS:</p>
<p>Recent studies have focused on expanding our current understanding of responsible mechanisms for racial differences in osteoporotic fracture risk. Using newer, three-dimensional imaging techniques, these studies demonstrated that racial differences in bone mass and structure are apparent early in adolescence, even when accounting for differences in bone size and muscle mass by race. In addition, recent studies using genetic admixture analysis showed that greater percentage of African admixture was independently associated with higher bone mass and more favorable parameters of bone strength in children and adults. Furthermore, recent studies showed that the relationships between 25-hydoxyvitamin D and bone outcomes differed by race, with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels being associated with lower bone quality and higher fracture risk in whites but not blacks.</p>
<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>Racial differences in bone mass and strength are apparent early in life, are independently associated with genetic ancestry, and may be partly explained by differences in the relationships between vitamin D and bone metabolism. Further studies are needed to explore these findings, with the ultimate goal of better defining molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying racial differences in bone quality.</p>

		<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve noticed about Blacks is that their bones seem to be harder than the bones of Whites.  Did you ever see some of their heads?  They&rsquo;re like bowling balls!  This is another reason why they make good fighters in the ring.  They&rsquo;re harder to hurt with a punch than an average White man is.</p>

		<p>It is well known in forensic circles that the identification of decomposed bodies into the categories of age, gender and race includes higher bone density for blacks.  Fact.</p>

		<p>#1 - Awakened, you are 100% right - the blacks have far greater bone density!  The elderly black women have much less risk for osteoporosis, which is an absolute PLAGUE on elderly white women, or at least those whose forbears are from the north and northwestern areas of Europe.  They lose inches in height and become bent, suffer from kyphosis or &#8220;dowager&rsquo;s hump&#8221; - not common at all in the sub-Saharan African female genes.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s a racist plot against whitey?  Hmm&hellip;.</p>
<p>My husband was a cop, and in the &rsquo;80s he was involved in some riots here in Brookly, NY (Crown Heights) when the blacks rioted (A Hasidic Jew accidentally ran over and killed a 7-year old black boy and the black&rsquo;s claimed they wouldn&rsquo;t take him to the hospital because he was black - totally untrue.  Anyway, they police were all using their clubs in self-defense.  Being in that type of riot is akin to walking among the hordes of attacking zombies in Dawn of the Dead.  Hitting those black man on the head is totally different; it is much harder, and much thicker.  Perhaps a good comparison would be earthenware and porcelain.  He describes the average white man to have a much softer head that can barely tolerate a small tap.  The black children&rsquo;s bones mature much faster too, and they are not as dependent on Vitamin D for conversion of calcium in the kidney.  AMAZING!  But we are all the same.  Another interesting thing; African eyes are farther apart, a trait that evolves in organisms that are often preyed on.  This is consistent with living near jungles, I&rsquo;m sure young African men have had to contend with lions and stuff.  I think that evolution, or intelligent design, or whatever is something that really never ceases to amaze me.  There are reasons for all of this.</p>

		<p>Racial differences surely will be irresistible for marketing<br>
before long ??  We have open acknowledgement of gender differences  in some vitamin marketing.  Minimum Daily Requirements have been debunked for decades now in alternative and<br>
integrative medicine  &mdash;  just in terms of the individual differences among the dominant Euro-American population.  As to differing averages between races  &mdash;  surely it must be quite significant and<br>
just awaiting a $$$ motive to authorize overt mention of it. We&rsquo;ll know inter-racial sex has hit a significant &#8220;market share&#8221; when a<br>
condom is marketed as Ebony Sheen  &mdash;   with, of course, a smell enhanced lubricant.  Oh, brave new world.  </p>

in average whites do better in boxing, amateur wrestling and mma, in rugby they also tend do be equal or better. </p>

		<p>This might be true, but don&rsquo;t hit a black man in the jaw with a round house right at the joint where the jaw meets the skull. It will kill him. blacks have hard bones that is true, but notice that in boxing one of the rules is not to hit the opponent with a round house to the face. if it hits the jaw of a black where it joins to the skull it will kill him. there have been instances where a cop will have a black in a head lock to bring him down; and then when he brings him down and lets go, he realizes that the black is dead. look at black professional whestlers. when they get into a head lock they are gasping for air and are in pain. that is because the weakest point of the skull for a black is at that joint. if you hit a black there, he will die. just like if you kick a black in the chins he will go down. their legs are actually not that strong. pound for pound whites are stronger.</p>

		<p>#2 IIRC they have smaller lungs too which counts for more when it comes to lack of flotation ability. </p>
