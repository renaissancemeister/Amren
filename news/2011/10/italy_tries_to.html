<h1>Italy Tries to Cope with Rising Tide of Immigration from Africa</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Tovrov, International Business Times, October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although African immigration is a &#8220;problem&#8221; across all of Europe, Italy and other Mediterranean countries are the most affected by this mass movement of people. Because of a 2003 European Union law called the Dublin II Regulation, the first European country an asylum seeker enters is solely responsible for the migrant&rsquo;s protection and application. This places a disproportionate burden on countries like Italy, where hundreds of migrants fleeing Libya and Tunisia at the start of the revolution landed daily.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year in Italy, the swell of sub-Saharan Africans entering the country  &mdash;  many of them former migrant workers escaping violence in Libya, some refugees from the Tunisian revolt, others fleeing the famine in Somalia  &mdash;  became so great that there were riots on the island of Lampedusa, where thousands of migrants waited months to be processed by an apathetic government.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most the immigrants in Italy, as with most countries around the world, head to big cities. About 15 percent of the people in Milan were foreign-born immigrants in 2009, according to the Italian National Institute of Statistics; while in Rome, about 10 percent of the population is non-Italian. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In general, the majority of people seeking asylum in Italy get rejected, forcing them either to await an eventual deportation or to enter Europe illegally.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Additionally, Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s government has tried to crack down on illegal immigration, starting with those already in Italy. In 2009, Italian legislators made entering or staying in the country illegally a criminal act punishable by a fine of $7,000-$14,000. Moreover, any landlord caught renting to an illegal immigrant faces up to three years in prison.</p>
<p>Berlusconi even said that these measures were so that a &#8220;multi-ethnic Italy&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t happen.</p>

		<p>Well at least Berlesconi is trying to keep Italy for Italians. The Italian people must also help by having larger families as their ancestors did. </p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have much of a problem &#8220;coping&#8221; with all these Africans.  I wouldn&rsquo;t let them in to begin with, and use force to stop those who try and enter in spite of my not giving them permission to enter.</p>
<p>Easy as that.</p>

Unfortunately, Italy has its hands tied by regulations of the EU, with which it must comply.  Italians are not allowed to &#8220;cope&#8221; in their own way.</p>

<p>The Eurocrats are subservient to global financial interests.  Any laws coming out of the EU concerning Europe&rsquo;s borders will be subservient to the goal of population increase, and breaking white European identity down and replacing it with that of &#8216;New Multicultural Man&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>The EU is frightening to say the least. I just can&rsquo;t fathom eastern European countries like Serbia wanting to join. Please just let it die already!</p>

		<p>Does being in the EU mean you have to commit national and racial suicide when told to do that.  When did a country give up its right to defend its self?</p>

		<p>Other posters have mentioned the EU &#8216;tying Italy&rsquo;s hands&rsquo;.<br>
This is one reason why that during this current existential crisis no-one should have too much sympathy for the EU.</p>

		<p>Just deport them. And KEEP ON deporting them. These people are not that stupid. Once they see you MEAN BUSINESS they will stop coming. In any case there is no alternative to deportation. Otherwise Italy and Europe will be swamped.</p>

		<p>The problem with the EU isn&rsquo;t its constituent member-states but the bureaucrats in Brussels who are as subservient to the House of Saud as America but as a domino effect of Nationalism spreads to more member-states, the greater their clout to change the legislation that binds them or flout it into redundance. In 2012 Russia starts building the S.Stream pipeline that will liberate the EU from Saudi oil, encourage Nationalism and may change the status quo in Brussels to unite all European states.</p>

<p>Apathetic?  How about OVERWHELMED and perhaps even rightfully angry?  Apathetic.  Indeed.  The wording of this entire paragraph makes it sound like everyone is so pitiful.  &#8220;Former migrant workers&#8221;, &#8220;refugees from the Tunisian revolt&#8221;, others fleeing famine.  As if evil Italy is being unfair to poor Africans.  I suppose the next thing will be that Italy is &#8220;racist&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s already implied in this paragraph and in the entire article, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Not quite true.</p>
<p>We have seen a number of documentaries on UK TV where investigative journalists have followed the illegal immigrant trail through the jungles of equatorial Africa from Nigeria, across the Sahara desert, across the Mediterranean sea, across Europe (Spain and France) across the English Channel to get into the UK and it left wing liberal soft touch socialist benefit system.</p>
<p>The journey takes between 2 and 4 years as the migrant has to stop and work illegally along the way to fund each stage of his journey (very few if any women do it) Many of them perish - dying of thirst in the Sahara, or drowning in the Med when the people runners drop them offshore and tell them to swim the last 100 yds to Spain and they can&rsquo;t - attempting to make the journey.</p>
<p>Once in the UK many are tracked down by the authorities and deported. <br>
They immediately start preparing for the next attempt.</p>
<p>The question that has to be asked is: <br>
Just how miserable is life in their home countries for them to be prepared to risk their lives to reach this perceived utopia - working as a security guard over weekends on a building site, or pushing a broom as a cleaner in building site offices where the white collar workers are - as I have seen here in the UK.</p>
<p>The tragedy is that their countries have every God given resource to be successful. This has been conclusively proven by the whites settlers who went to Africa and created viable businesses and economies wherever they put their roots down. South Africa is the best living example of this.</p>
<p>My mantra is that if sub-Saharan was a consolidated nation like the USA is, it could be a global super power. It has absolutely everything going for it EXCEPT intellectual capacity and capability.</p>
<p>As a Christian I find this the most difficult unanswered question of our time.</p>
<p>If as the liberals say race is a human construct and there is no biological basis for differences between the various ethnic groups ( I heard the Vice Chancellor of a well known University say this at a public lecture this week) - then why is there is difference in performance which leads to an illegal immigrant problem from Africa, which in turn deposits failed third world behaviours into their host first world countries.</p>
<p>I hope that in the fullness of time this inescapable fact will be revealed to me somehow, somewhere by somebody. </p>

		<p>So easy to deport! Why burden your country with these parasites when it is so easy to send them packing? All the specious arguments fail to convince, that procrastination in doing so spells ultimate ruination of a country. Wake=up from your multi-culti illusions of egalitarianism!</p>
