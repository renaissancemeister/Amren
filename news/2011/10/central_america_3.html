			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, October 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The spread of drug wars means young men in Central America can face a 1 in 50 chance of being murdered before reaching their 31st birthday, a U.N. report showed, describing the trend as close to &#8220;crisis point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worldwide, 468,000 people were victims of homicide in 2010, with around a third of cases in Africa and a further third in the Americas, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its first global report on homicide on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;In countries with high murder rates especially involving firearms, such as in Central America, 1 in 50 males aged 20 will be killed before they reach the age of 31  &mdash;  several hundred times higher than in some parts of Asia,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Globally, men account for around 80 percent of perpetrators and victims and are most likely to be killed on the street. Women are most likely to be murdered in the home by a partner or family member, the report said.</p>

		<p>I already know what the UN&rsquo;s &#8220;answer&#8221; will be: let them all emigrate to the United States, to lower the Central American murder average.  Of course, the US murder rate will soar still higher, but hey, that&rsquo;s the price of Diversity, eh?</p>
<p>Oh, and guns.  We&rsquo;ve gotta ban those evil guns.  It&rsquo;s the guns that force those poor Central American innocents to behave that way.</p>
<p>Somebody remind me, please: why do we still tolerate the UN?<br>

So that would be black and hispanic countries with the highest murder rates. </p>

		<p>Holy smokes, that is astronomicaly high. Imagine what that would result in if these Hispanics continue to flood into the U.S. They will create a situation where the homicide rate for whites will be far higher than that, and one very good reason to expel them from the country and prevent more for entering the country.</p>

		<p>One in fifty? That is much worse than it is for black American males.In San Francisco, a Salvadorian shot and killed a father and his 2 teenage sons in a car to car shooting.I wrote two letters to District Attorney Gascon, urging him to seek the Death Penalty. I got NO response. I am certain that he will not,but he SAYS that he MIGHT, in some cases. Maybe 15 or more killings. </p>

		<p>A couple of years ago I found a copy of &#8220;The Mammoth Book of Unsolved Crimes&#8221; in the bargain section at Borders(RIP). The book has several famous cases of unsolved murder along with many crimes that I had never heard of. The best part is an international section with unsolved homicides from Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc. This book must have been written in the 1990s or early 00s and already had a chapter dedicated to Guatamala and the horrific murders there. Many brutal serial killings and a woman&rsquo;s life seems to have no value whatsoever. The police are corrupt losers that make no effort to solve the many rape-murders that happen every year. I&rsquo;m guessing that many of the killers, and there are almost certainly gangs of them, hop freight trains across Mexico and into the USA. Gives one a warm feeling to think that a few of the diminutive indians I see everywhere might be responsible for brutal crimes in their own country. We have already had a number of sexual assaults tied in with these Central Americans that show up in my region to work as grooms during horse racing season. In one case a White seventeen year old was abducted off the street by a member of MS-13. He stripped her, but she managed to fight him off and escaped. I&rsquo;m not sure what happened to the migrant criminal, but our state is very soft on such thugs so he is either still awaiting trial or received some 5-10 year sentence. In no time he&rsquo;ll be free to prowl again. Hey, maybe he can use some of our tax dollars to attend college?</p>

		<p>Back in the Seventies I used to work in Central America.  While there was a high incidence of simple theft, there was virtually no incidence of violent crime.  I never heard of anybody being mugged or assaulted in any way.  One could walk around in Guatemala City, San Salvador, or Tegulcigalpa without any fear of getting mugged, though these places featured the most incredibly artful and talented pickpockets in the known world.</p>
<p>It would appear that the world&rsquo;s become a more violent place.</p>

Yes, it is amazing to realize how ultra-violent and savage those little 4-foot-five mellon-headed indians really are. They sometimes look docile.<br>
 Let&rsquo;s face it; take them out of the clothing and trappings of the Western World, take away their cars, their shoes, the electric devices they use,etc., and they are just grass- skirted primitives, performing blood rituals, raping children and all that other &#8220;vibrant&#8221; stuff Liberals love them for. <br>
They have not evolved one whit past jungle-dwelling people who squat down and defecate in the same places they eat. <br>
And they treat women worse than animals.<br>
Really, a fine people. So VIBRANT. </p>

		<p>Wow, those are some astounding numbers. But according to the movie &#8220;Boyz NThe Hood&#8221; 1991 (so being 20 years old these facts are probably outdated), in LA county, one in ten black males between 18 &amp; 21 yrs of age were incarcerated at some point in their lives. One in twenty would be murder victims within that same age group. So Central America is not as bad, but it sure isn&rsquo;t good either. Certainly not by Western standards.</p>

		<p>Does this story surprise anyone? Yes, Blaak Obango, guns will be targeted by the Global Socialists in order to make everything alright. </p>
<p>These same Socialists overlook the fact that these &#8220;people&#8221; have been killing each other for thousands of years, and neither need a reason, or a gun, to do so. </p>
<p>In the absence of guns, they will hack each other to death with machettes, or slash each other with knives. The end result is still the same. </p>
<p>Instead of &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221;, those protesting the Banks should camp outside the Federal Reserve, and the UN. But they are not smart enough for that. </p>

		<p>Central American men often remind me of bantam or game cockerels.</p>
<p>I believe the hideous past-time of cockfighting is still practised there, but in their natural pugnacity, aggression and squawking small bodied knife flailing arms, the men seem to have much about the rooster them - and the basic genetic fight instinct is probably the same.Curiously, another dark race conquered by the Spanish, the Fillipinos seem to have the same characteristic.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, woe betide America&rsquo;s blacks if the politicians continue to toss more of these bantam roosters into the vast sand-strewn cockpit bowl that is called inner city LA.</p>

		<p>Do we not have enough problems of our own, without worrying about murder in Central America? What about the murder in the United States? What about the flash mobs? What about the economy? Enough of worrying about other nations, countries, continents, etc. How about we just start taking care of our country and its people for a big ole change.</p>

		<p>John and Anonymous,</p>
<p>Maybe as Western Civilization retreats, the pre-Columbian Meso-American mores are being reestablished in Central America. Whites used to be humans most worthy of emulation. Most societies in the 19th Century, once exposed to the glories of the West, wanted to wear suits, shoes, etc. Now the Whites are despised as  contemptible weaklings. Maybe the other humans are seeing their natural, nasty, and brutish cultures reasserted. Someday Guatemala might tear down the Catholic churches and build pyramids with the rubble. </p>

<p>I remember those days. Central America was a great place for a canche  &mdash;  I remember walking around Guatemala City, guys always wanting to talk, girls always wanting to flirt&hellip;</p>
<p>What happened since then?<br>
1) a flood of small arms, manufactured by US firms  &mdash;  exports which our government seems to encourage.<br>
2) our stupid immigration policy (or rather lack of policy): we assimilated a young generation of Salvadorans to African-American underclass culture in Los Angeles, and then deported enough to set up the same underclass culture in Central America.<br>
3) our stupid drug policy: we prohibit recreational drugs, so that a money machine is available to the most evil people in the world, who use that money to gain control of countries like Guatemala.</p>
<p>Hey, all our fault. But just try to convince anybody in Congress of that!</p>

		<p>Is the UN going to come out and say that it&rsquo;s the Africans and Mestizos themselves who are causing the problem, or are they going to try to hint that it&rsquo;s bored white guys from American suburbs or college campuses who&rsquo;re committing these killings?</p>
<p>Even the contribution of US gun smuggling has been overrated.  When the Sandinistas were in charge of Nicaragua, they filled that country with all the weapons Russia was willing to supply; the area would be awash in modern military automatics whatever American gun-runners did or did not do.  A quick look at the pictures of armed African thugs from the news predominantly shows AK-47s (Chinese made, as the folding bayonet would indicate) and much smaller numbers of FN-FALs (Belgian), H&K; G-3s (German) and Vz-58s (Czech).</p>
<p>In Africa, they don&rsquo;t need the guns; they still use spears on each other in some places.  The other day I read a South African article from about 10 years ago in which two battalion-sized (~600 men each) groups of Zulus were preparing to go at it in the old style because they&rsquo;d been rustling each other&rsquo;s cattle.  Almost no guns; they were armed with traditional &#8220;iklwa&#8221; spears.  Police arrived in helicopters and got them to back down.  Note that gun control is stricter in South Africa than in the USA, but the Tugela Ferry area in KwaZulu-Natal is a hell-hole of Kalashnikov shootings.  AK-47s are smuggled in from Mozambique, yet another country that was grossly overarmed - during the Communist days - by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The problem with any UN effort to disarm these areas is that the locals aren&rsquo;t going to cooperate.  A classic example of this in Afghanistan after the Soviets pulled out.  CIA agents travelled the country, trying to buy back unused Stinger surface-to-air missiles, lest they be used against the wrong targets.  The Afghans didn&rsquo;t go for it; if they wanted money, they could always sell more opium.</p>
<p>As for drug legalization, that will not help at this point.  The drug cartels have branched out into so many other different sorts of criminal enterprises that the tipping point has been reached.  Most of these societies are currently in free-fall.  A recent article here at AmRen discussed the narcos torching a bar/casino (I think) because it wouldn&rsquo;t pay protection.  Something like 35 of the customers and staff died in the fire.  That incident had nothing to do with drugs.  Also in recent news, the cartels have been demanding that Mexico&rsquo;s schoolteachers pay them half their earnings as &#8220;protection&#8221;.  Since refusing these criminals&rsquo; demands tends to result in one being tortured, shot, beheaded, set on fire or some combination of the four, schoolteachers are going to quit in droves.  This also has nothing to do with the US consumption of drugs.  Finally, Mexico itself has a large domestic drug consumption.  Their 2010 census shows a population of 112 million, which makes for a fairly big market.  What the US does or does not do will have no effect on Mexican domestic demand.</p>
