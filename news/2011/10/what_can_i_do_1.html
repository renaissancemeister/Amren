Instead, I proposed a talk with the title &#8220;What Can I Do?&#8221; which he bravely accepted, noting that it was &#8220;the most difficult subject of all.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">During the 10 years since I spoke to an AR audience, I have come to feel that a deep interest in the comings and goings   &mdash;   alas as much going as coming   &mdash;   of diverse nationalist movements, interesting and entertaining though they are, has something of the voyeur about it. So many years have passed, so many false dawns have come, that it is time to look closely at our dilemma. It is time not merely to look closer to home, not just to look at them or even at us, but to look at me.</p><table class="boxcenter" style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/01a-Globe_in_Hand.jpg" alt="." width="576" height="506" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.85em; ">Probably not this, but we must do what we can.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">I assume this audience shares with me the three following assumptions: (1) that whatever else we believe we all agree that the culture and influence of the white man are in rapid decline, (2) that this fact is to be deplored, and (3) that over the last 50 years more could and should have been done to prevent that decline.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Other speakers are more able than I to offer analyses and accounts of our situation. Instead, I shall throw off some ideas about how each of us might be more effective. If I give some of you a few ideas this talk will not have been in vain.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">My first point is that you must know what you believe. Does this sound obvious? Groups and individuals often seem to be reactive, not clearly stating what they believe. They form groups that sweep far too many difficult subjects under the carpet. If you don&rsquo;t know what you believe you will have trouble explaining yourself to anyone, let alone convincing him. If you cannot explain what you want, you are on a long trip to nowhere. This is as true in politics as it is in business or private life.</p><table class="quoteleft" style="background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-right: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: left; width: 422px; "><tbody><tr><th>&#8216;If we believe, we believe, and it is our duty to act on what we believe.&rsquo;</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">If we know what we believe we come to the next thing we can do and that is stop apologizing. It&rsquo;s easy not to be apologetic about our beliefs at an AR meeting. I mean stop apologizing in your daily lives. When we apologize we are on the defensive. For example, I never apologize for the British Empire. And as for the subject of reparations for slavery, I believe in reparations the black man owes the white man, if only for the fact that so many black people are alive today and thriving thanks to white hygiene and technical efficiency. That is reason enough for compensation and gratitude.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Here are two different conversations on the same subject that show what I mean about apologizing:</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><em>Dialogue One</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;How can you defend a massive wall between the US and Mexico? It reminds me of Germany. We need Mexicans because they do the jobs we won&rsquo;t do.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp;We need to put up that wall to stop illegal immigrants</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s just so negative. This country was built by immigrants anyway.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp;We can&rsquo;t take so many millions at one go, since the country can&rsquo;t absorb them.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><em>Dialogue Two</em></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;How can you defend a massive wall between the US and Mexico? It reminds me of Germany. We need Mexicans because they do the jobs we won&rsquo;t do.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Michael:</strong>&nbsp;Is that so? How many of these illegal immigrants do you want? How many would you let in? If it doesn&rsquo;t matter then say directly that you don&rsquo;t believe in national boundaries at all. How high should taxes go to support them? How much extra income tax are you willing to pay?</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><strong>Alan:</strong>&nbsp;We have to look at income tax later&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">I hope you notice that in the second dialogue Michael is not apologizing. Apologizing sounds like weakness, and an impression of weakness is never good in politics.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">My next point is about optimists and pessimists. I have often been asked if I am optimistic about these matters, but I have never understood the question. It&rsquo;s irrelevant. If we believe, we believe, and it is our duty to act on what we believe.</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/03a-BritishFamilyinIndia.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="489" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.85em; ">&#8216;I never apologize for the British Empire&rsquo;</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Now it is true that for some, especially for a second generation of supporters of any movement, the chance of success plays a crucial role in their decision to join. For the first generation   &mdash;   the true believers as it were   &mdash;   it is a fatal mistake to make the &#8220;chances of success&#8221; a gauge of whether to act or not.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Propagandists and leaders of movements tend to be optimists while the members and followers are often pessimists. The pessimists first: we all know them   &mdash;   the doom and gloom merchants. They paint such a negative picture they give the impression nothing is worth trying.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">A long time ago there was in the USA a pro-white racially conscious publication that was notorious for its pessimism and downbeat reporting. If you saw someone brooding like Hamlet and asked &#8220;What&rsquo;s up with him?&#8221; the answer would be that he had been reading the latest issue. This magazine had an annual series in which the white person whom the editor thought had done the most damage to the white race would be depicted on the front cover, looking healthy and confident, and be awarded the honor of &#8220;Majority Renegade of the Year.&#8221; I wrote to this publication suggesting a series called &#8220;Majority Hero of the Year.&#8221; I got a letter back rejecting my proposal on the grounds that there are no majority heroes.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">There is another kind of pessimist   &mdash;   perhaps we should call him a misanthrope   &mdash;   who can only see the worst in people with whom he disagrees, instead of trying to work together on the basis of what they hold in common. A well-known British nationalist magazine that is also out of print took the misanthropic view of Harold Wilson, former Labour prime minister of Britain. He was well known for his opposition to Ian Smith&rsquo;s unilateral declaration of independence in Rhodesia, and was a confirmed internationalist on all major issues. The magazine often ran a not-very-good photograph of Wilson&rsquo;s owlish face with the caption &#8220;No change.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">So far as I know, the nationalist press never conceded anything good about Wilson. It never mentioned the remarkable fact that despite great pressure from Washington, he refused to commit Britain to engagement in Vietnam. He had also surprised many with his unexpected and stubborn resistance to metric measure when Britain joined the Common Market, demanding, for example, that we keep the pint as our measurement for beer. So far as I know, Wilson&rsquo;s insistence on the pint was unplanned, unpredicted, and based on some instinctive attachment to a cultural memory or tradition. Why couldn&rsquo;t the nationalist press recognize what was good in this instinct, and argue from it that Wilson should extend his firm positions to other areas? It is wrong always to see only the bad and never the good.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Optimists can do great harm as well. This is especially so when they make rosy, confident predictions about successes that are not achieved. In the past, British nationalists have boasted about how they would perform in elections only to leave their supporters dejected and mistrustful when the miserable results came in.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Optimists are often unable to say they were wrong. A political leader who has misjudged the electorate should be able to admit he made a mistake, but it seems that those who oppose the decline of the white man can never admit they were wrong.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The next point I would like to make is about cranks and historians. I put them together, but I don&rsquo;t want to imply that all historians are cranks or vice versa. Also, historians are not to be despised and one must be careful whom one calls a crank because many who point out unwelcome truths are called cranks. My definition of a crank is someone whose views are either so persistent, so emphatic, or so extreme as to cause embarrassment in &#8220;normal&#8221; company. If you feel you might be embarrassed by, say, having someone to dinner with friends or relatives   &mdash;   especially relatives   &mdash;   then he is likely to be a crank.</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/04a-Guilltine.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="673" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.85em; ">Why do the French celebrate this?</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Women have a better nose than men for cranks and are less afraid to call a spade a spade. Some years ago I went with my wife to a meeting in Germany organized by a man who edited a publication I read regularly and enjoyed. When we arrived a little late he was in the middle of addressing a meeting in exactly the terms one might expect of someone who had just achieved supreme power. In fact he had reached about paragraph 20 of what he called the &#8220;Constitution of the Fourth Reich.&#8221; My wife was pitiless: &#8220;Quite definitely a nutter,&#8221; she told me.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">What about historians? Bizarre as it may seem, historical controversy often causes more acrimony than does debate about pressing subjects of the present. As a foreigner addressing an American audience, I might assume I could speak respectfully of Abraham Lincoln, but I might be wrong. By speaking of Lincoln I evoke what is to many a bitter past and create unnecessary controversy.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Nationalist parties can create emotional and romantic appeal by evoking history, but they also make enemies. The National Front in France uses the tricolor, the French national flag, as part of its appeal to voters. That flag diminishes my enthusiasm for their cause because it is the flag of the French Revolution, which I despise. What, moreover, might a Breton nationalist who otherwise supports the front think of that flag? At the very least, when we make historical references and appeals to symbols, we should be very aware that they are divisive, and should be very sure of where we stand as to their meaning and legacy. Any political movement that ties its appeal to particular historical figures or movements risks alienating people who would otherwise support it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">It is important to remember that the general public is not greatly interested in history. For Joe Six-Pack, history is a yawn. He is not interested in ideologies or great men, but in what the British socialist politician Tony Benn called &#8220;security, peace, and prosperity.&#8221; These may seem tame to some of us, but we should not lose sight of their importance. Just see how quickly a festive atmosphere in a non-political setting will sour if you point out that Enoch Powell was right. A few men will think this is an interesting way to start a conversation; almost no women will.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">And this brings me to another point: women. I cast my eye around this room and there aren&rsquo;t enough of them. Nor are there enough of them making the arguments we consider vital. We may not like it but we live in a society dominated by female values. This is not the time and place to look at the whys and wherefores of that or to consider whether it is desirable, but it is so. We need to be realistic   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s what politics is about, not pious dreams.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">What does that mean in practice? Among other things, it means there is even less interest in history and even less susceptibility to historical romanticism than there might otherwise be. It also means that although facts are undoubtedly important, facts alone cannot persuade rationally. Women on the whole are not much interested in comparative IQ statistics. Men may be, but not women. Women are interested in knowing if they or their children can wander the streets without fear of harm or unwelcome attention. That interests women very much and that is where our politics and thoughts should be.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">What if you had a group of people who got together to, say, clean the streets in some area because the municipality wasn&rsquo;t doing its job, or that traveled together on public transport late at night to make sure everyone felt safe? If&nbsp;<em>American Renaissance</em>&nbsp;did this, there would hardly be a woman out there   &mdash;   not even a committed leftist   &mdash;   who would find it in her heart to denounce you.</p><table class="boxleft" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/04b-helping_elderly.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="437" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.85em; ">No one can criticize aid to the elderly.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Some years ago I suggested to the British National Party that it collect trash because it puts your opponents in an awkward position. How do you denounce people for collecting trash? I thought my advice had gone unheeded, but I was very pleased to read recently in an &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; posting on the Internet that the BNP was doing just that. &#8220;The BNP should know,&#8221; the anti-fascists sniffed, &#8220;that collecting rubbish is the responsibility of the local council.&#8221; That&rsquo;s not a very effective criticism.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Women are a magnet for any movement; they attract money and men. I&rsquo;ll give you both a negative and a positive example. About 30 years ago I was at a National Front meeting in central London. I had been told that the new organizer was efficient and ambitious, and it was true. He chaired the meeting in an effective, dynamic way, but there was another person at the meeting, who gave the opposite impression: a young woman making no effort to hide her boredom. &#8220;Who is that woman?&#8221; I asked, and was told she was the organizer&rsquo;s girlfriend. &#8220;Well,&#8221; I said, &#8220;either he will lose her or the front will lose him.&#8221; Within a month, he had resigned and neither he nor his girlfriend were seen or heard of again.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">I can cite a positive example from here in the USA. Some years ago a Briton of my acquaintance organized a group called &#8220;American Friends of the BNP,&#8221; the purpose of which seemed to be to raise money for the BNP. This person would invite speakers or organize events, at the end of which he would take up a collection. At one of these events he invited two British girls on a visit to America to come to the monthly meeting and help take up the collection. It seems that they were not political in any way and did not really understand what the meeting was about, but they were willing to oblige. They were even willing to oblige when the organizer asked them to wear Union Jack T-shirts. Now if Jared Taylor or I wear Union Jack T-shirts we are just two men wearing T-shirts. Union Jack T-shirts have another quality when worn by young ladies. The takings were reportedly a good 20 percent above the usual figure.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">My next point is about networking and socializing. Let us concede that rationally speaking, there is no need for any of you to make the effort of physically attending this conference. DVDs will undoubtedly be made of all the speeches, which can be watched in the comfort of your home. In a sense, our speeches here are just a pretext, in the same way as coffee is only a pretext for conversation when you say to someone, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s have coffee.&#8221; What is especially important is that we meet, socialize, get together, make new contacts, renew old ones, and exchange ideas and addresses with a willingness which is never the same when we only see names or faces on a screen.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Some years ago, at about the time the British National Front badly lost an election, it suffered what I thought was an even more serious loss: it lost &#8220;Excalibur House,&#8221; its social venue where members would meet for a drink or to play billiards. This was, in my opinion, a much more serious setback than a disappointing election result. That many people did not see it that way suggests to me that they do not understand the importance of social cohesion, association, and solidarity as a prerequisite of any political advance or influence. I must first effect change in my own life and the way I interact with others before I can change what is going on in the world at large. This is something women grasp instinctively, and when movements are dominated by men, they suffer from failing to grasp it.</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/05a-woman.jpg" alt="." width="324" height="537" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Alliances are my next point; people need to have a better understanding of what an alliance is. In one sense we in this room are an alliance. Mr. Taylor has not made us sign 39 articles of faith before attending this conference. All he needs to do is restrain cranks and historians. I have no doubt that what others here may think about hunting, for example, is quite likely to be different from what I think, but we set those differences aside.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">A late political leader noted that &#8220;one should be prepared to work with people next to whom one is obliged to hold one&rsquo;s nose.&#8221; He himself was unable to do this, and failed to build bridges that could have been very useful to his organization.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The fact remains that political movements that try to discuss race are always in a ghetto and seem friendless. I wonder how seriously they try to make friends. The best way to make friends is to support other groups out of friendship and conviction without expecting any immediate reward, and to praise, where possible, more readily than to condemn. If we praise a prime minister who defends the British pint we indirectly condemn those who do not. Being constantly negative encourages the &#8220;ghetto feeling&#8221; and makes one an easier target for attack. This does not mean that one should not attack where attack is justified, but an attack is more effective the more incisive it is, the more it appeals to general justice, and the more it is made in the knowledge of having at least the tacit support of friends.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><em>Schuster bleibt bei Deiner Leistung</em>&nbsp;is a German saying that means each of us should have talents on which we should concentrate. People are for the most part vain and need to be flattered. We need to be better at appreciating what each of us is good at and concentrate on encouraging that talent to flourish. People must be rewarded for what they do. Reward is not the reason we act on our beliefs, but with no reward at all   &mdash;   not even thanks or recognition   &mdash;   it is difficult for any of us to make a full commitment to anything. That is nothing to be ashamed of; it is human nature.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Coming together on the basis of what we believe   &mdash;   and I mean the three points I made at the beginning of my talk   &mdash;   we become a lobby and a force that grows in influence. We are an alliance of people who have come together united in one specific belief. We need to be able to join other social clubs and meeting houses and we need to have a more even balance of men and women than I see here today. These things come before political success.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">In France the French New Right understood that, but unfortunately fell into a kind of Parisian intellectual ghetto of its own. Still, the French were right to stress what they called the metapolitical, that which precedes the purely political.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The size of a nation also matters. I think it is no coincidence that, generally speaking, it is among small groups and in small nations that white resistance to multi-racialism is strongest. In small nations, fewer resources are needed to maintain a political party or movement that can have a national impact. At the same time, in a large country there is likely to be more geographical movement, which breaks up the closely knit groups that are the basis for an identity that opposes the one the national government promotes. For these reasons, oppositional movements are easier to start in the smaller European countries.</p><table class="boxcenter" style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/06a-VB_Poster.jpg" alt="." width="576" height="377" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.85em; ">Movements may be more successful&nbsp;<span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span></th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">We should also, as Lenin said, know the enemy. At the present time, the great mass of people are not historical movers and are not going to try to act to change history. They take things as they come, unless provoked by extreme physical duress, and even then they follow committed persons who can offer solutions.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">In my opinion the enemies of white survival or separation can be divided broadly into three groups. At the top is a small group of manipulators and propagandists who will never change their views and who are committed to the destruction of all movements similar to AR. All that can be done with them is to beat them. A second, larger group is composed of committed, active opponents, many of whom aspire or feel solidarity with the first group and are politically committed to it. This group includes those who believe they are opposing something truly evil and who draw that belief from distorted or false information. I believe that a large number of these people are women and their numbers and hostility will diminish greatly if we speak rationally and banish crankiness and provocation. The hostile media understand this. That is why they go to considerable lengths to depict racially conscious whites as evil and deceitful, and to portray their efforts as weak and small.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The third group   &mdash;   the largest and the least politically committed   &mdash;   must be made to understand that its interests coincide with ours. Our interests&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;theirs but they do not yet understand that.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">In order to counter the three groups that oppose us, therefore, I need to have the strength to fight the leadership of my opponents directly, to convince some opposing activists that they are misinformed, and to appeal to a larger mass of people by an appeal to facts, strength, and shared interests. Clearly, none of these things can be achieved effectively by an individual alone, so we should certainly be joining groups and engaging in dialogue with the world around us. At the same time, arguing personally with individuals is often more important than spreading propaganda anonymously, and is certainly more important than telling those who already agree with me what they want to hear.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">We need to present ourselves well on every occasion, private and public. Media savvy is something that can be learned, but again, it is important not to be defensive or apologetic   &mdash;   nor to be superior or condescending. I recall a British political leader of a white nationalist party being interviewed by a black journalist who made the entirely reasonable point that many colored immigrants were fearful of the suffering that would be caused by any scheme of enforced repatriation. The politician could not hide his condescension for the journalist or his disdain for the question. He insisted that people would simply have to follow the law as it then would be. There was even the suggestion of a smirk on the man&rsquo;s face.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">This left an unpleasant impression on me, even though I was broadly sympathetic to the scheme. One can imagine what kind of impression it must have made on the great majority of people watching the interview. We must, of course, advance our own interests, but it is wrong to be callous about the interests of others.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Another point to bear in mind is that although elitists often forget the people and their importance, populists can make a different mistake. They often miscalculate the effect of robust views expressed by the poorly educated. Those who express robust views are not usually any braver than those who speak more circumspectly; often they simply have less to lose. Rough talk about foreigners or scroungers is no substitute for a strong and well-based conviction that can be translated into deeds and commitment. Talk is cheap and easy, and it is easy to value it too highly. Commitment is quieter and more self-effacing. It is often undervalued and its importance overlooked.</p><table class="boxcenter" style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: auto; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/2008/08/06b-SVP_Poster.jpg" alt="." width="576" height="449" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr><tr><th class="photocaption" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.85em; "><span class="hellip" style="letter-spacing: 0.3em; ">&hellip;</span>&nbsp;in smaller nations.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Finally, it is often said that people are &#8220;asleep,&#8221; or they do not hear the call, or that they are unable to act in what is obviously their own interests. You know the kind of language I mean. I hope I have already replied to that objection. People will join us if they are drawn by the presence of women, the assurance of power, and the pursuit of their own interests.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">In this context I should like to see more direct, non-ideological involvement in the day-to-day. A specific example from current American politics would be this: The southern border with Mexico is essentially unguarded, whereas American troops make sure &#8220;insurgents&#8221; do not cross into Iraq or Afghanistan. How can guarding the borders of those countries be more important than guarding America&rsquo;s own borders?</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Americans will, of course, have many other facts and parallels on which to base trenchant arguments. AR is good at this. Arm yourselves with facts and use them. People are also very inclined to listen to arguments based on fairness. This was what propelled the big advance in civil rights in the 1960s   &mdash;   an appeal to fairness.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">At the same time, we must be able to make different arguments at different times. We can, for example, criticize the American government because it is prepared to enforce a bloody peace in Iraq but is not willing to ensure that the streets of Detroit are safe. This is a scandal that the great majority of Americans can surely understand. It is hard to criticize a position taken on these lines. It is easier to criticize one based on historical grievances or truthful but spiteful-sounding statistics about black crime. Some people must come to their own realizations of things in their own way. It is true that black crime rates are substantially higher than white crime rates, but it may not be useful to insist on saying so. It may be enough repeatedly to raise the issue of crime in Detroit and demand solutions rather than explanations from politicians. Some people will find their way to a more realistic understanding of the world when they are confronted with the issues in such a way.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Then again, other people may be impressed by statistics, at least statistics relevant to them. These would be contemporary statistics, not historical ones.

Strength comes above all from social acceptance, and social acceptance works in mysterious ways that are certainly not altogether rational. It has to do with what people think&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;people are thinking.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Acceptance often comes from activities that are not obviously political. In countries such as Belgium or Denmark or Switzerland where white identity movements are strong, it is possible to organize people unofficially and discretely to offer security on public transport late at night, to help older people, and do other things that receive favorable attention but are not political. Too often, among people who support any minority position, there is an obsession with parties and elections. It must be stressed that electoral success not built on solid social alliances and support will not last. Movements with sure foundations are those that have deep roots as a social and socializing movement, and are recognized and appreciated by people who are not politically engaged. In this respect, political movements are like religions: They are strong if they have healthy social and cultural roots and weak if they do not. I am not saying that one has to belong to a large organization, but three or four people together can achieve more than three or four times what one individual can achieve.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><em>American Renaissance</em>&nbsp;has got some but not all of these things right. On the whole, it avoids cranks and historians. It is difficult to steer between the Scylla of over-respectability by taking bland positions that betray our work, and the Charybdis of ghetto-building extremism. I believe AR also avoids the issues of pessimism and optimism. As far as women are concerned I cannot award AR high marks; if I were Jared Taylor&rsquo;s headmaster I would say, &#8220;Room for improvement here, boy.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">What about in the area of being sure of what we believe? AR does not have a clear political platform, but there may be good reasons for this. Whether AR should in the long term be mainly a magazine or an activist movement is something AR will have to define for itself in the years to come. As for providing an opportunity for networking, AR is to be congratulated. It is hard enough to put on a major conference without having to face scurrilous attempts to undermine you along the way.</p><table class="quoteleft" style="background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-right: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: left; width: 422px; "><tbody><tr><th>If I were Jared Taylor&rsquo;s headmaster I would say, &#8220;Room for improvement here, boy.&#8221;</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">As for alliances, anyone is free to disagree with AR&rsquo;s approach. Even if you agree with the three main assumptions with which I began this talk   &mdash;   about the importance of preserving and strengthening our culture   &mdash;   there may be those who do not wish to work within the same group. In that case, create a new group but not a hostile group. At this stage, there is nothing wrong with having many groups that cooperate loosely, tightly, or not at all, but they should share one fundamental operating principle: They should save their ammunition for those who oppose the very notion of a white future. There may be groups who share your general vision but with whom, for whatever reasons, you cannot work. Do not attack them. Just ignore them and work separately in your own way. Let us be ready to attack, and attack with conviction where and when we are sure of our ground, but nothing is gained by attacking groups with whom we have much in common.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Let me sum up the points I have made: There should more networking, more socializing, and more imaginative initiatives. We should make alliances, be realistic, and ensure that women are not hostile, disgruntled, or simply absent. To slightly misquote what one famous American president said, I should not first be asking what movements or organizations or individuals can do for me, but what I can do for them. It is very hard to answer the question &#8220;What can I do?&#8221; However, I hope these ideas may help some of you in finding answers to that most difficult question.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><em>This article is adapted from Michael Walker&rsquo;s speech at the 2008 AR conference.

		<p>I absolutely agree with the sentiments regarding women in this article.     I see far too many posts here at AMREN that denigrate women, at the expense of alienating us.  Please consider your entire audience.  White women are very concerned about the current future of whites in America.   We do NOT need even further villification of our gender here&hellip; we already suffer from it quite enough from other groups within our (still) great country.  Embrace us &amp; what we offer to the effort of preserving our way of life.</p>

		<p>Walker makes good points but he&rsquo;s too hard on AmRen. I agree with his criticisms but as I watch 90% of the GOP fight over 3 men who are worthless to their tribe even after all the Black flashmobs and Latino irridentism, the more I see that sane tactics &amp; policies of diverse rightwing figures from Ron Paul to Jared Taylor to David Duke just dont appeal to the 90% GOP electorate yet because it is still stupid &amp; greedy and NOT because Ron Paul or Jared Taylor &amp; WN are doing anything wrong.  </p>

The British Empire was the most enlightened empire in history. The legacy of that empire everywhere in the world but in Africa has been representative democracy and reasonably well functioning economies. <br>

If Great Britain had not stood alone against the Axis powers Nazi Germany would have conquered the mainland of Europe and killed an additional six million Jews. </p>

		<p>We need more focus on what we can do. Too may articles on how the ship is sinking, but none on how to build life rafts.</p>
<p>Leaving snarky comments on youtube or blogs as so many do does not advance our position.</p>
<p> I still think it would be a good idea to launch an underground publicity campaign for advancing the idea of immigration reduction.</p>
<p>The readers of AR have a diverse set of positions and causes, but I think in the light of massive unemployment there can never be a better time to go on the offensive for reducing immigration. </p>
<p>If not now, when?</p>
<p>A way to get our message to many people for very little money is to post signs on the highways.</p>
<p>There is a great video on youtube called</p>
<p><br>
How to Reach 100,000 People for Under $1.00 </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8abqbk8ex9E" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8abqbk8ex9E</a></p>
<p><br>
 This is a great video and is truly a way to reach millions of people for very little money.</p>
<p><br>
 What if we posted signs all over America</p>
<p> Want More Jobs?<br>
 Cut immigration!</p>
<p> Now most of Americans would agree with that sentiment, but they never hear such a sentiment in the media, if they started seeing it posted all over it would encourage everyone to start realizing they are not alone in thinking this way and be encouraged to speak up and act out on this position. </p>
<p>Also, by taking small steps like this will make people more ready to take further steps in the future.</p>
<p>Maybe you disagree with this idea, but you can not disagree we need to start taking actions as time is running out. </p>
<p>What actions do you think we should take?</p>

<p>The more highly sexualized the women of a culture - the less children they produce.  After all childbearing takes away from the energy needed to be a sex object. <br>
The chaste woman tends to have many more children than the strumpet.  Please don&rsquo;t turn our white women into sluts for money, even in the best of causes!</p>

		<p>No. 5 Eva, totally agree.  Being British, like the speaker, I am quite annoyed at him stating that we are not interested in history or IQ statistics, etc - unbelievably condescending!  Do men not worry about their children &#8216;wandering the streets&rsquo; especially as now they are nowhere near as safe as decades ago.  Otherwise quite a good speech.</p>

		<p>When I think of America in the 60&rsquo;s versus today, I am reminded of the story of a frog that immediately jumps out of a pan of boiling water, but stays in a pan of water that is slowly heated until it burns to death. Young people today growing up surrounded by minorities just assume the crime, thug mentality, and fear of being assaulted are just natural and that it&rsquo;s always been that way. It was not. </p>

<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t look at it that way. I don&rsquo;t see any belittling going on here. The fact is, normal men will always respond better to women (thank God!), and it has been true since the beginning of time. And let&rsquo;s be honest. I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find a woman who has NEVER used her looks, body, charm, flirting or gender to gain some advantage of some sort for herself on a personal level (yes, including myself) so why not do the same for a good cause? A VITAL cause in fact.</p>
<p>Now having said all that, I don&rsquo;t think we should be used solely as eye candy or be treated like bimbos either, but from what I can see in the White Nationalist movement, we are welcome and men have been very respectful of women, and know they can&rsquo;t get anywhere without us. Of course you have a few bitter men in the movement who seem to take pleasure in insulting and degrading women, but that usually comes from a marriage or relationship gone wrong, and it&rsquo;s up to the other men of the movement to set them straight. I agree with the author&rsquo;s assesment that women are critical if we are to have any kind of success, and personally I&rsquo;ll use any weapon in my arsenal to get it. </p>

		<p>Unamusement Park has made some flyers which you can distribute: https://unamusementpark.com/flyers/</p>
<p>I really like the idea of having a neighborhood watch program. In my hometown there was a de facto &#8220;sundown town&#8221; rule, enforced by the police&hellip;if the police aren&rsquo;t doing it, shouldn&rsquo;t somebody else step into the breach?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea: why isn&rsquo;t there an organization somewhere which helps white kids get out of hellish, minority-majority schools? There must be lawyers reading this, and educators––why not put your talents to good use for this cause? </p>

		<p>What about self-defense classes for women? There are some good books out there on women&rsquo;s self-defense, like &#8220;The Cornered Cat,&#8221; that could be used as &#8220;textbooks.&#8221; If an organization like the A3P, or Youth for Western Civilization, started putting on those kinds of classes for white women, I think you might find some supporters.</p>

		<p>I wish some rich white guys would start throwing money into the white movement. If you own a sports team or a Kentucky Derby horse, why not get involved in a real battle like the fight for the white race. I&rsquo;ve seen some fund drives asking for a hundred grand. Peanuts. There are many deserving white organizations. And we have needs like a white data institute for issuing press releases of new data, a lawyer fund to help lawyers whose business suffers because of white activism, or fired employee assistance for those who suffer job lose. Look at all the political parties for whites in Europe needing money. </p>
<p>For the rest of us there is always the missionary hobby. Come up with a circuit of places where you can meet people in a casual setting; lunch counters, bars, bus stops, smoking areas, cafes. Over 4 years I introduced 118 people to AmRen and the newsletter. A good place was a bar attached to a hotel. About a dozen of those people were American businessmen.</p>
<p>Most people out there have no idea there is a modern white movement or about the existence of AmRen. There must be many creative ways of getting the message out to our people without taking too big of a risk. </p>

<p>Internet is your friend, and TV even more. Stop whining about MSM and try to build another, parallel MSM- this time pro-European.</p>
<p>Slogans should be short &amp; message clear:</p>
<p>We are for European Americans (or indigenous Europeans). Not Whites, but Europeans.</p>
<p>We are not aggressors, but defenders of the greatest human endeavor, Western civilization. </p>
<p>Due to history&rsquo;s vagaries, almost complete power in Europe and the US is in hands of elites composed of short-sighted greedy people whose basic idea is destruction of European civilization on demographic level.</p>
<p>We demand that Japan, China and India take millions of African &#8220;refugees&#8221;.</p>
<p>We will try to enact laws that only economically responsible countries deserve to be helped. What goes for Greece and Italy, goes for Uganda or Somalia.</p>

		<p>No. 13 - Highduke - &#8216;to attract women you gotta have folk dancing clubs&rsquo;&hellip;you are as bad as he is.  Mr. Walker notices that in the room where he is giving his speech there are few women.  He then goes on to say that society is now &#8216;dominated by female values&rsquo;.  The fact that he thinks the only worth we women have is to put on a Union Jack T-shirt and do a &#8216;Dolly Parton&rsquo; is probably part of the reason.</p>

The rich white folks who own and run American benefit from open borders and a heterogeneous work force. Open borders make it possible for them to drive down wages. <br>
      <br>
A heterogeneous work force is more difficult to organize. White employees are more likely to identify with their white employers and supervisors than with non white co-workers. Thus, they are more likely to vote Republican.</p>

<p>Texas A&M; University is leaving the Big 12 for the SEC.  The exit fee to leave the Big 12 is something like $30 million.  The university figures it can pass the hat around and get that, most of it would come from a handful of successful alumni. </p>

		<p>Re: Post 19 - Folklore dancing attracts women in droves. It&rsquo;s not my opinion but a fact based on the experience all immigrant groups and if we consider male initiative in creating &amp; maintaining civilization &amp; religion plus the fact that there are so few female nationalists and no feminist nationalists, I really should&rsquo;ve typed in Post 13: &#8216;don&rsquo;t expect women to get into anything overtly ethnocentric for overtly ethnocentric reasons in an even remotely equal ratio to men&rsquo;. </p>

<p>Thanks for that wonderful video by the Freeway Blogger!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8abqbk8ex9E" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8abqbk8ex9E</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted it as a very strong suggestion to these folks:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/tFoji" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/tFoji</a></p>
<p>I think the people whose work you can observe at that link are doing some of the most effective pro-White activism against anti-Whites that is going on today. </p>
<p>More than that, it&rsquo;s a brand new approach that answers forever IMO what to do when someone tells you you&rsquo;re &#8220;a racist.&#8221; More importantly, it goes way, way beyond that in giving you techniques that put YOU on the offensive and put your opponents on the defensive struggling to answer YOUR charges against them, instead of our opponents being on the offensive and us struggling defensively to deflect their charges against us of &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;bigotry,&#8221; and all that other rot, as has been the case until now. Those days are OVER! (Yes, I am VERY excited about these folks&rsquo; methods and their message!)</p>
<p>At that link my own efforts are visible (I&rsquo;m a newbie there) trying to get posters and readers here at Amren interested in joining in with what these folks are doing.</p>
<p>I stumbled across their page several weeks ago that was just like the current page I linked above, and I liked what I saw them doing so much that I jumped right in immediately and imitated it&hellip;then I got a couple of helpful hints, and I was off and running! Their approach has increased the scope for whatever creativity and intelligence I have, and has made my posts in MSM much more effective. It&rsquo;s like seeing one&rsquo;s mental muscles double in size before one&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Their methods have also been used very effectively in speaking to groups or to individuals&hellip;it&rsquo;s about much more than just mainstream posting.</p>
<p>Pant, pant&hellip;maybe I need to take a breath&hellip;please check it out and I hope you enjoy!</p>
<p>The methods were developed in their basic form by a pro-White genius named Bob Whitaker.</p>
<p>Bob was involved in some way with the government in former days, and had a hand in the steady beaming into eastern Europe of the message, &#8220;If this is a workers&rsquo; paradise, why are there armed guards at the border to keep people in?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good representation of some (but not nearly all nor the most important IMO) of the aspects of his methods, which make use of simple true statements to make realities clear that are fuzzy to people, using explicatory phrases that work at both the rational and non-rational levels.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s be sincere: women aren&rsquo;t, contrary to men, political animals. Of course, not counting those women with more &#8220;male brain&#8221; (I&rsquo;m not referring to sexual orientation).</p>

		<p>No. 22 Highduke - I must admit to being mystified by your instance that folklore dancing holds this great attraction for women and what relevance it has to the topic of guarding our white culture.   I do not recall &#8216;English&rsquo; folklore dancing - ever. I don&rsquo;t think we have any.  I am not interested in immigrants &#8216;keeping their culture alive&rsquo; - this is part of our problem.  I cannot agree with you that it will work. The only thing that will work is Education and that has been dumbed down for decades.  I despaired at the rubbish my children were taught.</p>
<p>Of course women are not represented much in leadership roles.  The opportunities have not always been so generous as they are now.  It also means that we cannot be blamed for the current reverse of western fortunes.</p>
<p>Also No. 32 Bardon - it is my personal belief that Mrs. Thatcher was got rid of because the men were scared of her - irrational maybe but that is what I feel.  We haven&rsquo;t had a P.M. in Britain since with her forthrightness.  Must have been her &#8216;male brain&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Most White women already know this. They know black men are violent and prone to rape and other crimes.  Doesn&rsquo;t seem to deter them. </p>
<p> I am a White woman and yes, I have &#8220;belittled&#8221; women here who are the race traitors and are the lefty no brainers. Don&rsquo;t coddle or pander to these types. It is useless to do so. I tell it like I see it, whether it be a man or a woman. Far too many women go on emotion and misplaced altruism. They seem to always be for the underdog and they actually think these minorities are the underdogs. They are more easily manipulated and indoctrinated. That is a fact. If women can&rsquo;t take the heat then get out of the kitchen. We aren&rsquo;t all emotional cripples and can&rsquo;t stand criticism when needed.</p>

<p>I used to think the same way as you, but after 25 years of activism I know from experience that it is only ~ a 1% of White American women who are interested in WN politics from a purely political or intellectual reason. These woman are very interesting and throughout Western White history we have had some interesting White woman leaders/intellectuals.</p>
<p>But the large % of White women are simply interested in other things and we have to find ways to reach them. Most women are interested in things like boyfriends, other women&rsquo;s boyfriends, fashion, other women&rsquo;s butts in jeans, actors and actresses - going to college football games to be part of the good looking crowd all dressed in the home colors.</p>
<p>Many women don&rsquo;t care so much what their husband looks like, but they want good looking (White) children. We have to make this all come in to play for our side and stop trying to appeal to White women like they are men.</p>

<p>Be careful heaping praise upon Mrs. Thatcher; it&rsquo;s best to put things in perspective:</p>
<p>Dr. Sean Gabb writes on Libertarian Alliance,  <i>Margaret Thatcher   &mdash;   New Labour&rsquo;s Midwife</i></p>
<p><i>Margaret Thatcher was a bad thing for the cause of liberty in England.</i></p>
<p><i>She started the transformation of this country into a politically correct police state. Her Government behaved with an almost gloating disregard for constitutional norms. She brought in money laundering laws that have now been extended to a general supervision over our financial dealings. She relaxed the conditions for searches and seizure by the police. She increased the numbers and powers of the police. She weakened trial by jury. She weakened the due process protections of the accused. She gave executive agencies the power to fine and punish without due process. She began the first steps towards total criminalisation of gun possession.</i></p>
<p><i>She did not cut government spending. Instead, she allowed the conversion of local government and the lower administration into a system of sinecures for the Enemy Class. She allowed political correctness to take hold in local government&hellip;She extended and tightened the laws constraining free speech about race and immigration.  She ruthlessly pushed the speed of European integration</i> </p>

		<p>There have been some interesting comments on this topic but maybe we are all missing the point, until we get the mass media on our side or at least into a discussion we are all going nowhere - male or female.  Day in day out we are subjected to propaganda from them.  The BBC in this country is the worst.  They are still pushing the line that millions from the Third World are benefitting this country when in fact a large proportion will spend their entire lives on welfare.  Should you voice any protest over this you are a bigot, racist, nazi, etc.  It is a sad fact that the Internet is the only place for any discussion, until it is mainstream this is where we will be stuck.  We must get our freedom of speech back.</p>

		<p>A reflexive assumption seems to be that what can be done to assist<br>
an American renaissance is to be done within America.  Increasingly, reality in America is being perceived more clearly and discussed more clearly in some other nations than here.  An element of law-abiding activism just might be providing information and correspondence to those in other nations willing to report on matters that &#8220;our&#8221; own MSM more and more blocks out.  Perhaps it is not too fanciful to ponder the U.S. Department of State becoming the main brake and disincentive upon domestic &#8220;red guard&#8221; actions like preventing AR from peacefully assembling and indulging in a variant of the kind of &#8220;thought crime&#8221; liberty America was created to provide readers and thinkers and seers??   </p>

		<p>No. 28 Bon - I have Googled/Wikied Dr. Sean Gabb he seems a mixed bag.  &#8216;Gabb is for the legalisation of drugs&hellip;.sees no harm in gay marriage and adoption&hellip;.is isolationist in foreign affairs and is as much anti American as Eurosceptic&rsquo;.  Admittedly I have been selective  but I cannot take the views of someone like this as a benchmark.  I am not saying Margaret Thatcher was perfect, she is a controversial figure. I never voted for her myself but she had a strong personality and did presumably what she thought was right.  There have been ample Governments since who could have reversed anything that she put in place.  We had Tony Blair for 13 years surely you are not blaming her for that. All those people who always vote Labour were in fact voting Conservative? I would say things have got much worse since. We now have &#8216;leaders&rsquo; who will stand up for nothing, unless Brussels gives them permission. </p>
<p>No. 31 Highduke - I have also Googled.  I must have led a sheltered life.  Have never English folk danced and am pretty certain non of my friends have either.  However I will admit to the Morris Dancing, generally performed by men though.  Irish and Scottish I will agree, but not for me.  As a fund raiser I would be a dead loss.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another suggestion - comes from Whites way back in time in India when White warrior tribes invaded and conquered much of India:</p>
<p>Karma - White karma.</p>
<p>Do good deeds for other whites, especially other Whites who are some type of historic rival, enemy.</p>
<p>White Southerners, go out of your way to find and befriend decent Whites from New England - Yankees.</p>
<p>White Irish - go out of your way to find and befriend decent White British people and visa-versa.</p>
<p>White Germans - go out of your way to find and befriend White Slavic people.</p>
<p>Working class Whites - find some decent White middle class people or even wealthier Whites and help their children toughen up, fight back against Black bullies.</p>
<p>At this time, I especially encourage Whites who come from a Southern Baptist or other Evangelical Protestant background to seek out and befriend Whites from the Church of Latter Day Saints/Mormon Church - you&rsquo;ll find these are some of the nicest White people you will ever meet.</p>
<p>When our White people stop hating on each other for ridiculous divisions in the past, we will find ways to build  healthy, safe, prosperous new White communities, nations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a waste of time hating NWs who abuse us if we can&rsquo;t find a way to like or love our various types of White people.</p>

No. 22 Highduke - I must admit to being mystified by your instance that folklore dancing holds this great attraction for women and what relevance it has to the topic of guarding our white culture. I do not recall &lsquo;English&rsquo; folklore dancing - ever. I don&rsquo;t think we have any. I am not interested in immigrants &lsquo;keeping their culture alive&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe Highduke referred to the 19th and early 20th century<br>
immigrant clubs that held dances and taught young people the dances of the old country.  The big midwestern and north east cities were full of them.  Many of those clubs like Sons of Italy rented out their buildings for other events and made a great deal of money.  Milwaukee, Chicago, St Louis and other midwestern cities are full of glorius old buildings built by Bavarian, Rhineland, Polish and other groups.</p>
<p>They were sold when the blacks drove the Whites out of the cities.</p>
<p>There are still square dancing clubs that preserve American southern native culture.</p>
<p>Those clubs did hold the immigrants together for generation after generation.  What they did was encourage Whites to refer to consider themselves Irish, Polish, Italian whatever long after they should have considered themselves White Americans.</p>
<p>Irish music and dance is very popular in America right now with Michael Flaherty and his Lord of the Dance company.  I&rsquo;m sure it makes the Irish Americans very proud and almost everyone enjoys Riverdance.</p>
<p>Those ethnic folk dance clubs kept Whites separate from other Whites far too long.<br>

		<p>No. 41 Anonymous - Thank you for the explanation.  I have never heard of any of that before and had no idea of the tradition.  I must admit I have wondered why Americans often put some other nationality in front of &#8216;American&rsquo; when describing themselves.</p>

		<p> <i>Dr. Sean Gabb seems a mixed bag. &lsquo;Gabb is for the legalisation of drugs&hellip;.sees no harm in gay marriage and adoption&hellip;.is isolationist in foreign affairs.</i></p>
<p>I too am for the legalization of drugs, also I wish the US WERE isolationist in foreign affairs!! I am 100% against the US meddling in the affairs of foreign countries and trying to &#8220;democratize&#8221; the Middle East.  The British were correct to pull out.  The US has not won the War on Drugs, it is a losing battle and ties up law enforcement agencies that could be put to better use  (that&rsquo;s a VERY brief explanation of my views).</p>
<p><i>Admittedly I have been selective but I cannot take the views of someone like this as a benchmark&hellip;. We had Tony Blair for 13 years surely you are not blaming her for that.  I would say things have got much worse since. We now have &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; who will stand up for nothing, unless Brussels gives them permission.</i></p>
<p>Is Dr. Gabb  correct in his analysis?  </p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S what really matters. And yes, things have gotten a lot worse for you (as for us too for that matter!!) What Dr. Gabb writes that Lady Thatcher laid down the foundation for Blair and Britain&rsquo;s new police state.</p>
<p>He reports: </p>
<p><i>[Margaret Thatcher} did not just make the world safe for New Labour – she created New Labour. Without her precedents and her general transformation of our laws and institutions, Tony Blair would have been impossible.</i></p>
<p>I weep at the transformations of our countries, the race replacement of the Native Born and Founding White Populations.  Britain gave us two of the greatest gifts the world has ever seen:  British Common Law and The Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>All will be lost as Britain becomes an authoritarian police state eventually taken over by Sharia Law and in the US, repressive, Anti-White Cultural Marxism and Redistributionist policies become the prevailing principles upon which the country is run.</p>
<p>When Sir Cyril Osborne tried for a decade, in futility,  to curtail non-White immigration into England way back in 1965,  he told the House, <i>Our children and grandchildren will curse us for our moral cowardice.</i></p>
<p>All The Best To You!</p>
<p>Bon</p>

		<p>Reply to Jack in Chicago about white karma:</p>
<p>Jared Taylor is the only white nationalist leader, that I know of, who refrains from anti-semitism, accepts Jews as white people, and even partners with Jews who are loyal members of the white race.</p>
<p>Even though sometimes anti-semites post anti-semitic comments on this website, American Renaissance is still the only pro-white organization, that I know of, that does not itself have any official anti-semitic content on it&rsquo;s website or in it&rsquo;s magazine.  I have been a subscriber to this organization&rsquo;s magazine for quite some time.</p>
<p>I have heard that in prison, because of the extreme racial divide in the prison system, Jews and neo-Nazis are sometimes forced to put aside their differences and band together for survival.  Does anyone reading this comment know more about what this paragraph is talking about?</p>
<p><b>[I think you misunderstand.  It&rsquo;s not that AR specifically wants to pan anti-Semitism or philo-Semitism, and it&rsquo;s not that AR has taken sides on such matters either way. it&rsquo;s that we want as little discussion of those kinds of issues as possible, because AR has no official opinion on such things.  It&rsquo;s an impossible and fatal third rail.   &mdash;   Moderator]</b></p>

		<p>No. 43 Bon - We will have to agree to disagree on some view points but I am with you on weeping at the &#8216;transformation of our countries&rsquo;, indeed all white countries. If our cultures are lost then our countries will become Third World ghettos as there will be no one left to provide the welfare. Yesterday&rsquo;s T.V. pictures from Libya are a nightmare that could happen to us. At the moment we are awash with &#8216;moral cowardice&rsquo;.  Hopefully we can both make a stand.</p>
