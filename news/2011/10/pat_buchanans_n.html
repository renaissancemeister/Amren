			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Virgil Goode, Daily Caller, October 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the last two decades, Pat Buchanan has warned that America is on the edge of ruin due to our irrational immigration, economic and foreign policies. As events have proven Buchanan right, Americans have become more receptive to his brand of conservatism, which he lays out in his new book Suicide of a Superpower.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that the Republican Party is still ignoring his wise advice. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Republicans have at least been giving lip service to the problem of illegal immigration, their words are rarely backed by action, and they still refuse to address legal immigration. In my opinion, this is the gravest issue facing the country. Buchanan takes the GOP to task for its dereliction of duty, &#8220;through its support of mass immigration, its support of paralysis in preventing twelve to twenty million illegal aliens from entering and staying in this country, and its failure to address the &#8216;anchor baby&rsquo; issue, the Republican Party has birthed a new electorate that will send the party the way of the Whigs.&#8221;</p>
<p>What does he mean? Pat Buchanan accepts Howard Dean&rsquo;s gaffe that the GOP is &#8220;the white party&#8221; as simple truth. Pat puts the facts bluntly: &#8220;Due to the immigration and higher birthrates among people of color, America is becoming less white and less Christian  &mdash;  and therefore inevitably less Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt many will accuse him of racism for making this point, but Buchanan quotes many liberal commentators who say they support immigration for that very reason. For example Michael Moore consoled liberals after George W. Bush&rsquo;s victory in 2004, &#8220;88% of Bush&rsquo;s support came from white voters, in 50 years America will no longer have a white majority.&#8221; Assuming our immigration policies do not change, that date will actually be 2042.</p>
<p>One would think that out of pure political calculus, Republicans would oppose mass immigration, but instead GOP strategist Lance Tarrance called for the party to abandon the Southern Strategy for the &#8220;Hispanic Strategy.&#8221; However, as Buchanan shows, Hispanics vote overwhelmingly Democratic regardless of a GOP candidate&rsquo;s position on immigration. In fact, a higher percentage of Hispanics support tough immigration policies than vote Republican.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many more important reasons to be opposed to massive immigration than how it will affect the GOP&rsquo;s electoral chances. {snip}</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, immigration without assimilation is undermining our very culture. With the majority of illegal immigrants and the plurality of legal immigrants coming from Mexico, Buchanan notes that many of our southern neighbor&rsquo;s leaders and citizens have a grudge against America. He cites a Zogby poll that found that &#8220;69% of the people in Mexico believe that the first loyalty of U.S. Citizens of Mexican descent should be to Mexico.&#8221; Mexico even has a government Office for Mexicans Abroad with the explicit purpose of preventing assimilation. According to the one-time head of the agency Juan Hernandez, &#8220;I want the third generation, the seventh generation, I want them all to think &#8216;Mexico First.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s solution for the immigration problem: an end to anchor baby citizenship, a moratorium on all legal immigration until unemployment is below 6%, a crackdown on the employers of illegal immigrants and a strong rejection of amnesty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While I might quibble with a few points, Buchanan offers an astute diagnosis of America&rsquo;s problems and gives constructive suggestions to put us back on track.</p>

		<p>Virgil Goode was one of the few Republicans that lost in the blue wave election cycles of 2006 and 2008 (he lost in 2008), whose political departure I truly regret.  Goode was one of the few vocally protectionist anti-freetrade Republicans in the U.S. House.</p>

		<p>Regarding Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s moratorium on legal immigration until unemployment is below 6%, I would say there should be a moratorium on all nonessential legal immigration for at least 10 years. During this time we would have a national discussion as to who should be allowed to immigrate, is it acceptable for immigrants to be a public charge, are we willing to demand assimilation of new immigrants, how many legal immigrants should we allow each year, etc.</p>
<p>Only after these and other ideas are analyzed should immigration be resumed and only at much lower numbers than today.</p>

		<p>We need more Republicans like this in office.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s holding the GOP back right now from real action on immigration is the capitalist class and their campaign contributions.  The cheap labor lobby needs to be taken on directly and crushed.  </p>

		<p>Herman Cain  seems to be the most popular Republican presidential candidate at the moment.</p>
<p>He was president of the national restaurant association.  That business is probably the biggest employer and recruiter of illegal hispanics in the country, bigger than agriculture.</p>
<p>In addition to hiring illegals the restaurant association funds dozens of pro illegal immigration lobbyists.  It also funds those immigrant legal defense firms that fight deportation and sue for goverment benefits.</p>
<p>With manufacturing and clerical work gone overseas, restaurants are one of the major employers in America, right up there with education and medical.</p>
<p>The millions of illegals the restaurants employ have taken jobs from millions of White Americans. Millions of White Americans are un employed and being ethnicly cleansed by the national restaurant association and its memebers.</p>
<p>Many of the big chains have 800 numbers posted around in Mexico and Central America.</p>
<p>A pox on both their houses.  Republicans vs Democrats,the enemy of my enemy is not my friend but another enemy.</p>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t the pro-mass immigration faction understand that for every one - legal and illegal - who comes into our country means unemployed Americans must compete a little harder for jobs. When I hear the traitors in Washington say, &#8220;we need people who can do these jobs, so let&rsquo;s bring in more,&#8221; I wonder why they are bypassing their own people? Who do they think pays the bills and keeps them bellying up to the public trough?</p>

		<p>It may be &#8220;clear-headed&#8221; to some, but to race-realists and the like, it must surely be frustrating in the extreme. In typical Buchanan fashion, he continually baits the hook (regarding race-reality) and then in next paragraph reverts back to more &#8220;mainstream&#8221; ideas, sometimes seeming to disavow what he&rsquo;d just suggested. When he refers to Madison Grant&rsquo;s words as racial &#8220;hatred&#8221; or something to that effect, he really put me off, personally, and leaves me wondering if he does, in point of fact, get it after all! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m tired of this cat and mouse game! Our people don&rsquo;t have time for games. He is so close to telling the truth on these issues, but year after year, and indeed book after book, he pulls up short. Remember, most reading his books aren&rsquo;t nearly as race-savvy as the average AR reader. It must necessarily be confusing to the unenlightened to keep going back and forth like this - plating a seed, then digging it up and tossing it away. </p>
<p>I like Pat - I like his writing style and he is indeed brave&hellip;for a mainstreamer. But half-truths and sins-of-omission will only get you so far! I so wish he would go that ONE step further, repercussions be damned!</p>

		<p>HH expresses my own opinions exactly. He says it all.</p>
<p>I too like Pat, but he&rsquo;s a strange bird, and that must be said. He can&rsquo;t be called &#8220;brave&#8221; when (at his age!) he&rsquo;s too timid to tell the whole truth or to stick to one clear position.  He waffles this way, and then he waffles that way. Just what DOES he stand for, anyway?  So why doesn&rsquo;t he just say it?  Is he really dancing around the issues,  or does he just fail to see them?  And his attack on Madison Grant is undefensible. It makes you wonder if he really has any concept of race after all. </p>

		<p>HH, Madison Grant raised awareness of racial differences, but he was a proponent of Eugenics. That&rsquo;s enough reason to separate yourself from him. Stop immigration, get rid of illegal immigrants, don&rsquo;t extend visas and lower the number of third world people in this country. </p>
<p>Eugenics is a totalitarian idea and inconsistent with our principles of liberty and freedom. I&rsquo;m against it morally, but also practically; it would not be limited to foreign &#8220;undesirables&#8221; for long. Soon it would be applied to everyone. Think ancient Sparta. Or classifying political opponents as defective. Its too much power for any person, organization and certainly too much power for the government to wield.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be &ldquo;clear-headed&rdquo; to some, but to race-realists and the like, it must surely be frustrating in the extreme.

<p>Frustrating it may be, but frustration is an emotion that must be controlled, though not suppressed. Several religions, nations and movements have broken apart because lots of people are at least, if not more frustrated and angry at those who SHOULD agree with you but do not QUITE do so. This is fundamentally self-destructive, as for everyone there&rsquo;s plenty of people who don&rsquo;t agree with you at all. Against heathens, heretics are natural allies.</p>
<p>People on the fringe benefit from those who agree with them publicly on many things, and push the boundaries of mainstream outwards. Sure, it&rsquo;s immensely frustrating, especially since the main benefit for those mainstream people is to have a lightning rod to deflect anger away from them, someone to point at and say &#8220;hey, you can deal with me or with those guys&#8221;.</p>
<p>Still, most of times it is nonetheless mutually beneficial (exceptions do exist of course). I mean, as far as I can gather, Jared Taylor is about as well-read, intelligent and skilled writer as Buchanan, but now, who&rsquo;s the one who has to struggle against all odds all the time, and who&rsquo;s the one who has pretty easy time expressing his thoughts to much wider audience?</p>

		<p>To those who claim that Buchanan doesn&rsquo;t go far enough, I think the reaction to his book proves that he has gone exactly as far as he could, and then some, while maintaining any connection whatsoever to mass-media discourse.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s recent book, one could say, goes further. But it has also been thoroughly ignored by the mainstream media (for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>Which is the better approach? A book that goes further, but that relatively few read? Or a book that equivocates where it needs to, but reaches a broader audience?</p>
<p>(Then answer of course, is that BOTH are needed. Thus, we need braver books   &mdash;   and yes, even books that go further than Taylor&rsquo;s in criticizing ethnic groups that are considered off limits. But we also need books like Buchanan&rsquo;s, which tread a little more carefully, but still upset the orthodoxy, while reaching a more sizable audience. Buchanan is an essential entry point into the movement to save European and European-American culture and race.)</p>

<p>I agree. Every arena of discussion has its rules, which one must obey or get kicked out of to speak no more. We need every arena to have pro-Whites pushing and enlarging that arena toward the pro-White direction. Pat Buchanan is doing that.</p>
<p>Hopefully when he&rsquo;s older and his work is behind him, he will stand up and say to the biggest audience possible:</p>
<p>Everybody says there is this race problem. Everybody says this race problem will be solved when the third world pours into every white country and only into white countries.</p>
<p>The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this race problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.</p>
<p>Everybody says the final solution to this race problem is for every white country and only white countries to &ldquo;assimilate,&rdquo; i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.</p>
<p>What if I said there was this race problem and this race problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into every black country and only into black countries?</p>
<p>How long would it take anyone to realize I&rsquo;m not talking about a race problem. I am talking about the final solution to the black problem?</p>
<p>And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn&rsquo;t object to this?</p>
<p>But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.</p>
<p>They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.</p>

<p>Its author is former gov&rsquo;t psychological warrior and writer Bob Whitaker, who created the &#8220;Mantra&#8221; I quoted in post #11, the final line of which I tack onto most of my posts,</p>
<p><i>Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White</i></p>
<p>Currently the project of Bob and his crew is to get the phrases &#8220;anti-White,&#8221; &#8220;pro-White,&#8221; and &#8220;White Genocide&#8221; into everyday parlance by repeating them as frequently as possible everywhere we can. The hope is to displace the terminology of our enemies (the r-word and its many relatives) in which popular thinking is now framed, so that popular thinking will be framed in our terminology.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a project that will require more numbers, or at least the adoption and spreading of the terms by the people who see them and like them.</p>
<p>Lots of books are banned in Canada btw. No white countries have the freedom of speech we still have here.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t read Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s latest book, but I agree with 10 - Karsten. I think that Mr. Buchanan is practicing incrementalism, which is wise. People have been so brainwashed on this subject that they will shut down and not listen if you appear too extreme to them. Usually it is much more effective to move them a little at a time until they reach a tipping point.</p>
<p>Although one doesn&rsquo;t hear as much about it as one did decades ago, it used to be common to hear from people how important it was that the U.S. entered World War II and helped to defeat Hitler. Otherwise we would all be speaking German. Well, the probability that we&rsquo;ll all be speaking Spanish seems much higher than it ever did with German, yet where is the hue and cry about this invasion of our country?</p>
<p>Article IV, section 4, of the U.S. Constitution reads &#8220;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion; and on Application of the Legislature or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened)against domestic Violence.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, why is our federal government not protecting us against invasion?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just grateful for what the man has done. How many Amrens would it take to move Whites as much as he probably has in the direction we want them to move in?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s drawing racial distinctions on national media at a time when most Whites have been trained to not even think such thoughts. Bless him!</p>
<p>Suppose he did stand up and repeat the Mantra against White Genocide, and spoke other truths. He&rsquo;d only get to do it once, and what would be the result? </p>
<p>What happened to the man who was possibly the most beloved and popular American hero ever when he told the truth as he saw it? And how much effect did his telling the truth have?</p>
<p>Buchanan isn&rsquo;t the most beloved and popular American hero ever, and the anti-White media would make mincemeat of him in the public mind, and of whatever he said, in just a few days.</p>
<p>Timing is everything. If we succeed in making the fact of White Genocide a part of every White&rsquo;s understanding by repeating that expression at every opportunity, then it would become effective for national figures to say it publicly. Their saying it wouldn&rsquo;t be just isolated incomprehensible utterances then, but would be part of a new ethos that had already been forming.</p>
<p>Timing is everything, and so is repetition.</p>

<p>The moratorium being pushed by Buchanan and Brimelow is ultimately legalized race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;and it would also deprive Native Born White Americans of the great benefit of a severe labor scarcity.</p>

<p>Because it is much easier to sell a temporary/ten year moratorium on immigration during this time of high unemployment than it would be to push through an out and out pro White immigration policy making the USA a permanent White nation forever. We have to stop falling for the losing trap of going</p>
<p>&#8220;for all or nothing&#8221; as we always wind up getting nothing.<br>

&hellip;&#8221;I&rsquo;ve always felt similarly about abortionists&hellip; They try to make nicey by calling themselves &ldquo;pro-choice.&rdquo; They should be called &ldquo;PRO-MURDER.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true,  they do use a euphemism.  That&rsquo;s annoying.  But to call it MURDER is all the more absurd.   It all depends on what you consider a human being.</p>
<p>I am not in favor of abortion either. (Who is?)   But these anti-abortion fanatics are  really annoying.  Lately, they have infested this place!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Buchanan&rsquo;s solution for the immigration problem: an end to anchor baby citizenship, a moratorium on all legal immigration until unemployment is below 6%, a crackdown on the employers of illegal immigrants and a strong rejection of amnesty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would say all that, plus a permanent end to non-Western European immigration.</p>

<p>No, &#8220;pro-choice&#8221; is the right term, because that is exactly what we are for. It should be a woman&rsquo;s choice whether she wants to continue a pregnancy, not the government&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand how an anti-abortion stand is compatible with being pro-White. Do you want to stop blacks and mestizos from getting abortions (I know the Christian Right loves to whine about Planned Parenthood wanting to exterminate blacks because they have clinics in their neighborhoods)? What about White women who&rsquo;ve been raped by a black? Should they be forced to give birth to a rapist&rsquo;s mulatto spawn?  </p>

<p>And with a few economic bubbles and employment falls below six percent, the asians will  agitate-use  their enormous political muscle-to crank up legal immigration again to make Native Born White American race-replacement a permanent unalterable fact. That&rsquo;s what the moratorium is all about:race-replacement.</p>
<p>Moratorium is an attempt to make immigration reform safe to treasonous Republican senators and congressman who are on the take from the asian lobby and the corporations. But why should we be doing this if a moratorium means cranking up legal immigration again when unemployment drops below 6 percent..this will make race-replacment complete and final. Why would you be in favor of this? And what would be so terrible about unemployment dropping below six percent? Absoutely nothing. Essentially, you would deprive millions of Native Born White Americans of the great benefit of a severe labor sarcity&hellip;this is a very serious matter.</p>
<p>The moratorium makes the immigration issue 100 percent an economic issue..in effect, we concede the race issue to the asian invaders&hellip;this makes opposing nonwhite immigration illegitimate&hellip;and, as a consequence, legitimizes the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority for economic reasons.</p>
<p>You are assuming that race-replacement can be reversed through the beltway&hellip;it can not&hellip;there is not enough time for incrementalist policy change. This in itself should put an end to the moratorium nonesense. You are either for reversing race-replacement or you are aren&rsquo;t. The moratorium has 0 to do with reversing race-replacement..the moratorium is legalized race-replacement..and if you understand this very obvious point..you would never support it.</p>
<p>It is of the  highest urgency for the celebrities of this movement to encourage a Native Born White American revolt against race-replacement at the hands of post-1965 nonwhites..the situation for Native Born White Americans is absolutely dire. Pat Buchanan should have written a very detailed blood and guts book explaining to his fellow Native Born White Americans exactly what they are going to have to give up for racial minority status. It would be very easy to show that racial minority status for Native Born White Americans means a corresponding exponential increase in the nonwhite population..and this means..with 100 percent certainty..ecological collapse across the US..and this means-with 100 percent certainty that the minority Native Born White American population will be completely finished. Our fellow Native Born White Americans must be confronted with this soon as possible. When you understand the obviousness of this, you understand that the moratorium is complete nonesense..it is in the realm of rearranging the chairs on the Titanic. </p>

He is so close to telling the truth on these issues, but year after year, and indeed book after book, he pulls up short. Remember, most reading his books aren&rsquo;t nearly as race-savvy as the average AR reader. It must necessarily be confusing to the unenlightened to keep going back and forth like this - plating a seed, then digging it up and tossing it away.</p>
<p>I like Pat - I like his writing style and he is indeed brave&hellip;for a mainstreamer. But half-truths and sins-of-omission will only get you so far! I so wish he would go that ONE step further, repercussions be damned!<br>

<p>One of the best comments about Pat B. I have read. I feel the same way as you do and if Pat called Madison Grant&rsquo;s words racial hatred that did it for me. Pat is afraid of going all the way and then to label someone like Madison, who tells it like it is, a &#8220;hater&#8221; then there is no hope for Pat waking up anybody. I think he just loves to write books and get publicity (even if bad publicity) and make the $$$ while he still can.</p>

		<p>Hello #25: According to the American Nationalist Union, which sells that book in question, they noted that it was actually banned in Canada. </p>
<p>I was going on the informatiom provided by one of its Distributors. </p>
<p>It would be far better for Canadian Nationalists if this book, and others, were not banned there. </p>
<p>I like how the Canadian Government goes on and on about freedom, yet restricts its Citizens right to information, and the exchange of ideas. Much like what they are trying to do, here.</p>
<p>For those interested, I recommend the You Tube video, &#8220;Overview of America&#8221;. Too many people confuse the difference between a Democracy and a Constitutional Republic. <br>
