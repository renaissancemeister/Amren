<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;As the faith that gave birth to the West is dying in the West, peoples of European descent from the steppes of Russia to the coast of California have begun to die out, as the Third World treks north to claim the estate. The last decade provided corroborating if not conclusive proof that we are in the Indian Summer of our civilization.&#8221; </p>
<p>So begins Pat Buchanan in his hardcore work, SUICIDE OF A SUPERPOWER. </p>
<p>&#8220;Will America Survive to 2025?&#8221; </p>
<p>Buchanan, set for maximum controversy, launches all rockets at introduction &#8220;Disintegrating Nation&#8221;  &mdash;  and does not let up for 400-plus pages. </p>
<p>&#8220;America is disintegrating. The centrifugal forces pulling us apart are growing inexorably. What unites us is dissolving. And this is true of Western Civilization &hellip; . Meanwhile, the state is failing in its most fundamental duties. It is no longer able to defend our borders, balance our budgets, or win our wars.&#8221; </p>
<p>The books reads as if its been written to be left behind in the ruins, only to be found by a future civilization. </p>
<p>SUICIDE ranked #2,668 on AMAZON&rsquo;s hit parade early Friday. It streets on Tuesday. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Passing of a Superpower </p>
<p>&#8220;We have accepted today the existence in perpetuity of a permanent underclass of scores of millions who cannot cope and must be carried by society  &mdash;  fed, clothed, housed, tutored, medicated at taxpayer&rsquo;s expense their entire lives. We have a dependent nation the size of Spain in our independent America. We have a new division in our country, those who pay a double or triple fare, and those who ride forever free.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chapter 4. The End of White America </p>
<p>&#8220;[W]hite America is an endangered species. By 2020, whites over 65 will out-number those 17 and under. Deaths will exceed births. The white population will begin to shrink and, should present birth rates persist, slowly disappear.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Mexico is moving north. Ethnically, linguistically and culturally, the verdict of 1848 is being over-turned. Will this Mexican nation within a nation advance the goals of the Constitution  &mdash;  to &#8220;insure domestic tranquility&#8221; and &#8216;make us a more perfect union&rsquo;? Or have we imperiled our union?&#8221; (Page 134) </p>
<p>Chapter 5. Demographic Winter </p>
<p>&#8220;Peoples of European descent are not only in a relative but a real decline. They are aging, dying, disappearing. This is the existential crisis of the West.&#8221; (Page 166) </p>
<p>&#8220;Not any Iranian weapon of mass destruction but demography is the existential crisis Israel faces &hellip; .By mid-century &hellip; Palestinians west of the Jordan river will out-number Jews 2-1. Add Palestinians in Jordan, it is 3-1.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;In a startling development of history, Russia&rsquo;s population has fallen from 148 million in 1991 to 140 million today and is projected to plunge to 116 million by 2050, a loss of 32 million Russians in six decades.&#8221; </p>
<p>Chapter 6. Equality Vs. Freedom </p>
<p>&#8220;Those who would change society begin by changing the meaning of words. At Howard University, LBJ changed the meaning of equality from the attainable  &mdash;  an end to segregation and a legislated equality of rights for African-Americans  &mdash;  to the impossible: a socialist utopia.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;A time for truth. As most kids do not have the athletic ability to play high school sports, or the musical ability to play in the band, or the verbal ability to excel in debate, not every child has the academic ability to do high school work. No two children are created equal, not even identical twins. The family is the incubator of inequality and God its author.&#8221; </p>
<p>Chapter 7. The Diversity Cult </p>
<p>&#8220;The non-Europeanization of America is heartening news of an almost transcendental quality,&#8221; Wattenberg trilled.4 Yet, one wonders: What kind of man looks with transcendental joy to a day when the people among whom he was raised have become a minority in a nation where the majority rules?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;Historians will look back in stupor at 20th and 21st century Americans who believed the magnificent republic they inherited would be enriched by bringing in scores of millions from the failed states of the Third World.&#8221; </p>
<p>Chapter 8: The Triumph Of Tribalism </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s war of revenge against Japan was a race war. Newsreels, movies, magazines, comic books, headlines treated &#8220;Japs&#8221; as a repulsive race whose extermination would benefit mankind &hellip; .Only well after the war was over was it re-branded a war to bring the blessings of democracy to &hellip; Japan. </p>
<p>We may deny the existence of ethnonationalism, detest it, condemn it. But this creator and destroyer of empires and nations is a force infinitely more powerful than globalism, for it engages the heart. Men will die for it. Religion, race, culture and tribe are the four horsemen of the coming apocalypse. </p>
<p>Chapter 9. &#8216;The White Party&rsquo; </p>
<p>&#8220;Through its support of mass immigration, its paralysis in power to prevent 12-20 million illegal aliens from entering and staying, its failure to address the &#8220;anchor-baby&#8221; issue, the Republican Party has birthed a new electorate that will send it the way of the Whigs.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chapter 11: The Last Chance </p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to create a nation that has never before existed, of all the races, tribes, cultures and creeds of Earth, where all are equal. In this utopian drive for the perfect society of our dreams we are killing the real country we inherited  &mdash;  the best and greatest country on earth.&#8221; </p>

		<p>I doubt this book would have attracted much attention during the second term of President Clinton. The country enjoyed peace and prosperity back then. The crime rate was in decline. Although Bill Clinton was not setting a good example for the nation&rsquo;s young, I have even read that sexual activity among teenagers was declining.<br>
 <br>
Because we are facing the most serious economic down turn since the Great Depression, and cannot win the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, this book will sell. Nevertheless, the crime rate has continued to decline.<br>

Unemployment is lower than it was when Ronald Reagan had been in office an equal number of months.<br>

In the United States the black birth rate has been declining along with the white birth rate.<br>
 <br>
https://www.aei.org/issue/17614<br>
 <br>
The rise in the Hispanic population can be dealt with by further restrictions, and expelling the illegals. <br>
 <br>
Other things being equal, a declining population means a higher standard of living, because there is more of everything good to go around. <br>
 <br>
Also, a high percentage of young men is destabilizing. The high birth rate of the Arabs is the ultimate reason for Islamic terrorism. The low birth rate among Russians is the reason the Soviet Union collapsed with little violence. The declining birth rate in Latin America is the reason democratic governments are spreading throughout the region. </p>

		<p>Can anyone name a major conservative presidential candidate that was as cerebral, intellectually honest, and prophetic?  Did we ever have a political leader who was so passionate about politically incorrect ideas that actually matter?  Pat is truly a hero for speaking the truth yet remaining in the &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; so as to actually be heard.  I love his writing, but I wish he was more rigorous in connecting the dots.  He is a brilliant observer of &#8216;what&rsquo; and he is a bold truth-teller of &#8216;ought,&rsquo; but I am never satisfied with his explanations of &#8216;why&rsquo; we are committing suicide and &#8216;how&rsquo; we can rectify the situation.</p>

		<p>As long as European women see men as partners and not providers, we will continue shrinking. Wherever women work, birthrates go down and divorce goes up from the upper castes of India to Europe. Russia&rsquo;s incentives for working mothers to have babies can only slow the debacle and I&rsquo;m confident that Russia will use a future economic crisis to revive the traditional family structure because it would end unemployment, double wages and lower the cost of living without creating new jobs.</p>

		<p>Pat Buchanan calls it &#8220;Suicide,&#8221; but a better word would be &#8220;Genocide.&#8221;</p>
<p>When whites who are locked up and subjected to the tender mercies of black criminals then hang themselves, is that properly called suicide, or murder?</p>
<p>So we must ask what was done to our people to bring them to their present condition. Who were the anti-Whites who wrote the books and preached the preachments, and why did they write and preach them, that persuaded Whites to forsake their religion, to reduce their numbers (&#8220;The Population Bomb&#8221; by Paul Ehrlich published in 1968 was very influential), to admit floods of third worlders to their countries (thereby removing the barriers that are always required for distinct subspecies to maintain their biological distinction from each other).</p>
<p>Who put in place the programs that take wealth from Whites that Whites could use to raise larger families and give that wealth to the third world populations among us so that those third world populations can raise larger families instead?</p>
<p>By whom and for what reasons have Whites been demoralized by multicult propaganda to not even care about White Genocide, but to consider the elimination of the White race by interbreeding to be a solution to racial problems?</p>
<p>The purposeful elimination of a race by whatever means is defined by the U.N. as genocide. What the anti-Whites of the world and of this country want is White genocide, and we pro-Whites have not yet found the successful means of resisting their genocidal program.</p>

		<p>I recall the black mob attack on Emily Guendelsberger in Philly a few months ago where they broke her leg and she is permanently disabled. She right away defended them as kids and refused to cite race. I think this will wear off as she becomes increasingly frustrated having to accommodate a serious disability for the rest of her life. I think even hard core leftist whites will start to fight back when they are faced with being permanently disabled by groups of blacks on a regular basis.</p>

		<p>Buchanan worked for Nixon. </p>
<p>That administration gave us Section 8, affirmative action, enforced Griggs vs Duke Power and Kaiser vs Weber, and the Philadelphia plan that destroyed the White male construction business.</p>
<p>The Nixon administration aided and abetted more school busing. The worst and most far reaching action against Whites was the Nixon administration&rsquo;s turning the EEOC from an agency whose purpose was to prevent discrimination against qualified blacks to an agency whose purpose was to force the hiring of unqualified blacks far, far over the quota percentages.</p>
<p>Nixon also funded many of the worst war on poverty, LEAP EEOP CETA and other federal programs.  These Nixon era programs were nothing more than massive hiring programs for radical blacks and new left SDS Weather Underground red diaper Whites.</p>
<p>They had nothing to do but mooch around state and local government agencies.  The blacks just harassed women, took off early, and called in sick.  The Whites in Nixon&rsquo;s programs were hard leftists.</p>
<p>Bernadette Dohrn, while working under another name in one of Nixon&rsquo;s CETA programs was the one who placed the bomb in the back window of Park Police Station in San Francisco in 1971.  One police officer, Brian Mcconnell was killed.  Another was blinded. Dohrn was on the run from a murder on the east coast at the time.  The woman who hired her knew exactly who Dorhn was, a criminal with a felony murder warrant out.</p>
<p>Were it not for Nixon&rsquo;s program, Dohrn would not have been paid a salary to live in Sausalito and place a bomb in a police station.</p>
<p>The Ingelwood police station assassinations in San Francisco were carried out by White weather underground and black panthers working and being paid by one of Nixon&rsquo;s CETA programs.</p>
<p>The president under whom Buchanan got his start was more responsible for the demise of White America than Lyndon Johnson and Carter combined. </p>

		<p>Man this book is unpleasant, but the truth hurts. In our own homelands, we are being outbred by races who despise us, and we have only ourselves to blame. Even worse most our people our ambivalent about our survival, while other races relentlessly fight for their best interests. </p>

		<p>Wow, it sounds like the most powerful, hard-hitting and plain-spoken book by Buchanan yet.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Not any Iranian weapon of mass destruction but demography is the existential crisis Israel faces &hellip; .By mid-century &hellip; Palestinians west of the Jordan river will out-number Jews 2-1. Add Palestinians in Jordan, it is 3-1.&rdquo;</i> </p>
<p>It looks like an almost universal phenomenon that as prosperity increases, procreation decreases. The left would have us believe this will happen in the so-called &#8220;developing&#8221; nations, as well, as soon as they become prosperous enough. The problem is, if history is any guide, that will never happen. So whites are pouring money into these nations to prop them up while ignoring their own demise.</p>

		<p>Here we go again:  More great words from PJB.  Except what matters are actions, not words.  And PJB&rsquo;s actions leave a whole lot to be desired in light of his words:</p>
<p>*  While he did not endorse the race treason of the Republican Presidents for whom he worked (Nixon and Reagan, more so Nixon), it&rsquo;s all a matter of &#8220;the company you keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>*  After his 1992 and 1996 campaigns for President within the Republican Party, it wasn&rsquo;t hard for him to endorse Geo. H.W. Bush and Boob Dole.  In either cycle, if he would have won the nomination, Bush/Dole wouldn&rsquo;t have endorsed him at all, and in fact, would have actively worked against him.  I can&rsquo;t fathom being so loyal to an institution that would not reciprocate, and wants nothing to do you.</p>
<p>*  Two words:  Ezola Foster.</p>
<p>*  Also, during his Reform Party campaign in 2000, he was way too willing to play in the sandboxes of far left black kooks like Lenora Fulani.</p>
<p>*  While I don&rsquo;t consider Willis Carto nor his publications the most reliable and dependable ones on Earth, if my column were running in either The Spotlight or American Free Press, I sure as hell wouldn&rsquo;t ask Carto to stop running my column in order to assuage the whining of the Pro-Defamation League.</p>

<p>Well stated, Pat B. Who is that Wattenberg guy you mentioned who loves our demise?  </p>
<p>Remember what Bill Clinton said&hellip;.he was very happy to see our demise, also.</p>
<p>Former President Bill Clinton said Saturday that Americans should be mindful of the nation&rsquo;s changing demographics, which led to the election of Barack Obama as president.</p>
<p>He told an Arab-American audience of 1,000 people that the U.S. is no longer just a black-white country, nor a country that is dominated by Christians and a powerful Jewish minority, given the growing numbers of Muslims, Hindus and other religious groups here.</p>
<p>Clinton said by 2050 the U.S. will no longer have a majority of people with European heritage and that in an interdependent world &ldquo;this is a very positive thing.&rdquo;</p>

		<p> Another very disturbing, very frank book, from a conservative not afraid to say what he thinks   &mdash;   with no apologies. Drudge&rsquo;s summary of the basic points of the book make it sound eerily reminiscent of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s &#8220;White Identity,&#8221; published earlier this year.</p>
<p> And this brings me to a point which has also disturbed me for some time: When authors such as Taylor and Buchanan write books like this, books that I believe state the case exactly as it is, and give us dire predictions for the future of our race, cannot they somehow give us any cause for hope, any reason to feel that fighting back is possible?</p>
<p> Mr. Taylor did, briefly, at the end of his book. I have not read Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s book yet, so I&rsquo;ve yet to find out whether he thinks all this is as inevitable as a Greek tragedy. Jared Taylor gave us at least a modicum of hope, faint as it may be. I fervently wish for Mr. Buchanan to have done the same.</p>

		<p>Occidental Dissent has a good series of articles coming out about white complacency regarding our &#8220;celebrated&#8221; dispossession.  Celebrated by whites, that is.  I believe only Part I has been published and it is an interesting read.</p>
<p>I do not know what is wrong with many, but not all, white people.  I do not understand why so many whites feel no tribalism toward other whites.  I simply cannot comprehend why so many of us do not heed the warning signs that are flashing - in neon - in front of us.  Perhaps it is true, our best and brightest died during the two world wars.  And this would include any intelligent offspring that would have resulted from their survival.</p>
<p>In my verbal discussions with other whites I find that maybe 2-3 out of 10 are racially conscious and disgusted with what&rsquo;s going on.  That is not a very good percentage.  And, my hope for things turning around is of an even lower percentage point.</p>

		<p>While I still can&rsquo;t understand why Pat Buchanan chose a black woman to be his running mate when he ran for president as an independent various years ago, he&rsquo;s still the man. He handles all the &#8220;effete intellectual snobs&#8221; with ease on CNBC and I just thank God that somehow he&rsquo;s able to be on mainstream media to inject a bit of sanity in the midst of the liberal and pseudo-conservative &#8220;talking heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>I look forward to reading his latest book.</p>

		<p>The line Suicide of a Superpower sounds a bit like the title of George Gilders book from around 1970, Sexual Suicide. There have been a few brave souls warning us off and on for almost 100 years now. Of course, they&rsquo;re always dismissed by the &#8216;right&rsquo; as defeatists and detriments to our race. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why Patrick Buchanan always features thoughts about a last chance and what we can do to turn things around to the way they were before. </p>

		<p>&#8220;America&rsquo;s war of revenge against Japan was a race war. Newsreels, movies, magazines, comic books, headlines treated &ldquo;Japs&rdquo; as a repulsive race whose extermination would benefit mankind &hellip; .Only well after the war was over was it re-branded a war to bring the blessings of democracy to &hellip; Japan. &#8220;</p>
<p>I think much of what Pat Buchanan is saying is important. HOWEVER, Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s skew of the U.S. war with Japan as a &#8220;war of revenge&#8221; robs him of credibility to speak on U.S. history, projections,or related matters.  While accusing liberals and others of re-writing history through false characterizations and outright lies, he does it himself. This and an over-reliance on his Catholic world view prevents a thoroughly objective analysis of the full peril that the West faces.  One suspects that his message is simply to have more babies and less abortions.  But he doesn&rsquo;t explain how we could do that and deny the same to non-whites.  So with no abortions for any group, the white decline is doomed to succeed.  Only the most radical of white reactions and solutions will save us.  I have doubts that enough whites have the fortitude and will to do what needs to be done.  So it will be a long drawn out decline to extinction, with a bit of sparring here and there - unless&hellip; </p>

This country is coming apart for sure and Republicans, even the ones cloaked in the Tea Party flag, are not going to save it.  The only bright spot I see in it all is that the fragmentation into so many factions makes the formation of a power block based on White Nationalism a better possibility than it has ever been.  Time to get beyond pontificating about the problem and begin organizing to correct it.</p>

He tiptoes around the real issues and the whys that cause them.  He refuses to name names or place blame.  When he gets almost to the truth, he draws back and hesitates to say it.</p>

		<p>Go Pat go! I am very glad to see that he is speaking out in another book, as every new one is better than the last one. I just wish that he would quit mixing his metaphors. He keeps talking about the &#8216;nation&rsquo; and the &#8216;country&rsquo; as if they were one and the same. They are not. There are many different nations (such as the Black, Brown, White ones etc.) living within the country known as the United States. That is the big problem, and the primary reason that White America is disintegrating. He also talks about &#8216;culture&rsquo;, when he obviously means race. This further confuses a clear understanding of the actual problem. Race is the key to history, and he needs to state it boldly.</p>

<p>Your analysis seems a bit strange.  It is as though you are trying to say something but cannot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crime rate was in decline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Could the declining rate have had anything to do with the &#8220;prison industrial complex&#8221; that left (politicians and media) was constantly whining about in 1994 when the Republicans came to power?</p>
<p>&#8220;I have even read that sexual activity among teenagers was declining.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like to know where you &#8220;read&#8221; that?  Cannot imagine any male passing up opportunities for sex.  So if true, girls must have been offering less.  It would be interest to see an explanation for such a phenomena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unemployment is lower than it was when Ronald Reagan had been in office an equal number of months.&#8221;</p>
<p>I guess you are comparing Reagan to Clinton?  Do you really think a single man affects a nation so directly?   If you are correct, the US should put Clinton back in office so we, as well as Clinton, can enjoy the benefits again.  Maybe fathers would be willing to sacrifice their daughters for a presidential staining.   But could the rise of the Internet had anything to do with the &#8220;Clinton miracle&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;The declining birth rate in Latin America is the reason democratic governments are spreading throughout the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting observation, Reagan presidency resulted in increased sexual activity.  Can you provide any evidence for the relationship between and nation&rsquo;s population and form of government?  India has a large population and is democracy.  And Japan has a dense population and has a democracy. </p>

As a general global rule, the &#8220;proles&#8221; (i.e. those who produce little else than more babies) must never outnumber the producers, the problem-solving people must never be swamped by the problem-creating people, and so far as the white &#8220;west&#8221; (actually mainly north and to some extent far south) goes, we must first keep our homelands just because they are our own homelands, we must next ensure that our own clever people are not outbred by our own stupid people, and finally we must show peoples in other lands both the advantage to them of communicable white achievement without them physically invading our homelands, and the example of humanitarian eugenics all round.<br>

<p>I agree with your sentiments. Whites should stick together more than any other race, but we don&rsquo;t. How many times do you see whites guys ready to kill each other over a ball landing too close on the golf course, or getting cut off in traffic, yet they hold doors open &amp; say &#8220;excuse me&#8221; to the blacks. It is really amazing how the &#8220;sheeple&#8221; simply cannot see what is happening and they cannot recognize the enemy. Not to mention the white idiots who voted for Obammy. God I hope people will wake up, and soon!</p>

		<p><i>Pat Buchanan calls it &ldquo;Suicide,&rdquo; but a better word would be &ldquo;Genocide.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>True, but we have a lot of work to do before any publishers would touch a book dealing with the genocide of the White race!</p>
<p>A petition is being sent to the Russian president, Medvedev, to ask for Solidarity Against White Genocide. Here are a few excerpts from the petition, and on its link below, if you are possibly interested in signing it, please click on the tab &#8220;Petition Activity&#8221; and read the short message there.</p>
<p><i>Russia is the only majority white country that does not grovel at the feet of the United States and its European Union.</i></p>
<p>The question comes up regularly over here: &ldquo;Is Eastern Europe ready for immigration yet?&rdquo; It is demanded of every country in Europe and America that it literally change its complexion, that they bring in tens of millions of third world immigrants.</p>
<p>This question is never asked of Japan or Taiwan, but it is demanded of equally crowded European countries like the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>It is an automatic demand made on ONLY white countries. Massive third world immigration and assimilation is a demand made on ALL white countries.</p>
<p>The cry is &ldquo;Asia for the Asians, Africa for the Africans, and white countries for EVERYBODY!</p>
<p>We ask Russia to throw this genocidal demand back into the faces of the American and European establishments.</p>

		<p>&#8220;How do multiculturalists answer Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s honesty?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have not a clue how multiculturalist&rsquo;s answer his honesty but here is a WN answer. I do not believe he is being honest. He says just enough to sell books to people like us, but shuts up about the real racial problems just enough to be accepted to be on the mass media.I know damn well he knows the REAL problem of the West and it is all comes down to race. Yet even at over 70 he wants the big bucks.</p>
<p>Compare that to Paul Craig Roberts who is not even allowed on the MSM because of his unabashed honesty. Also Paul Craig Roberts in his review of this book takes Pat to task for his absurd crying that the rich are getting everything taken away. Roberts correctly points out the statistics point out since 1980 all the wealth of the USA has gone to the top 1%. of which Pat is a member. All I ever seen him get really mad about that Mass would not be in Latin anymore. Pat who is a Plutocrat who knows the truth yet chooses to sell out just for money. He does not even have a kid to leave it all to. America has been destroyed by our Plutocratic class and by nobody else. Pat who needs him, not me!</p>

		<p>Continuosly attacking Buchanan for his connection so long ago to Nixon reminds me somewhat, of the way they bring out that old photo of David Duke in his Nazi suit every time he runs for something.  One of the big reasons we never get anywhere is our propensity to magnify the flaws and overlook the virtues of the few brave souls who stick their necks out in defense of our own best interests.  Shut up about Nixon and Foster already and be glad we have Pat out there doing more for our cause then any of his critics would have the brains or guts to do.</p>

		<p>29) Remember, the AIDS virus was making the news daily at that point. Also, Clinton did end some welfare for people who got pregnant out of wedlock, forcing people to become responsible for their own actions. Sexual activity among teenagers was in decline during that period for these reasons. Dig up some old newspaper articles if you don&rsquo;t believe it. I don&rsquo;t know exactly how much it declined though.</p>
<p>Also, I believe that almost all unstable countries have a birth rate of over 4/woman because it&rsquo;s difficult to control all the young people.</p>
<p>I dispute &#8220;Other things being equal, a declining population means a higher standard of living, because there is more of everything good to go around.&#8221; though. The cost of any product is the cost of development + variable costs. More people means that the cost of development is spread among more people, leading to lower costs. Hence an increasing population tends to produce a higher standard of living and a declining one tends to lower it. Unless of course the average IQ declines, but that&rsquo;s another topic.<br>

Also i heard Sharpton and his callers openly celebrating the murder of the Coptic Christans last week and say that&rsquo;s what he should be doing here.

		<p><i>We pro-Whites have not yet found the successful means of resisting their genocidal program.</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  H. Dumpty</p>
<p>Excellent comment.</p>
<p>We Whites are in a fight for our very survival against a hostile, EVIL government, an EVIL academia and an EVIL media which promote and encourage White dispossession and replacement. </p>
<p>The following must end immediately if American Whites are to survive as a race:</p>
<p>*Third World immigration<br>
*Massive Numbers of Welfare Births<br>
*AA programs<br>
*Forced integration in neighborhoods and schools<br>
*America Last trade and foreign policy</p>
<p>Are ANY of the major candidates addressing even ONE of these issues that are so crucial to White survival?  NO?  Then White genocide continues apace.  I don&rsquo;t see much hope of us pulling out of this death spiral.</p>
<p>To anyone who disagrees: please post why you believe this is wrong.  Tell me what hope we Whites have? Because frankly, I don&rsquo;t see it, and as Mr. Dumpty posts:  We haven&rsquo;t been able to figure out how to resist the genocidal pogrom our enemies have set in motion for us.</p>
<p><i>The president under whom Buchanan got his start was more responsible for the demise of White America than Lyndon Johnson and Carter combined.</i></p>
<p>LBJ was a boob and a fool!  He signed the 1965 Hart-Celler immigrant flood bill which will soon make Whites a minority in the US, surrounded by a majority of hateful non-Whites.</p>
<p>At the signing ceremony LBJ declared:  &ldquo;This bill we sign today is not a revolutionary bill. It does not affect the lives of millions. It will not restructure the shape of our daily lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>He surely knows what&rsquo;s going on. At his age, why is he waiting to say it?</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Browser</p>
<p>Because if he did, he would lose what media expose he has left. Publishers too, ask Jared Taylor!!</p>
<p>Mr. Brimelow writes:</p>
<p><i>Taylor&rsquo;s publisher, Kent Carroll, refused to handle this sequel and told Taylor that he regretted publishing the original, despite its success, because of the backlash from industry peers. Two literary agents, Theron Raines and Paul Zack, attracted by the manuscript&rsquo;s undeniable skill and power, spent years trying to place it before giving up in surprised despair.</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think Pat Buchanan doesn&rsquo;t know this.</p>
<p>The following is from the article:  <i>Pat Buchanan is Censored by Human Events</i></p>
<p><i>Pat Buchanan is a national treasure  &mdash;  by far the most articulate and sensible spokesman in the mainstream media  &mdash;  or at least close to it  &mdash;  for a wide range of issues, from immigration, to economic nationalism, to foreign policy issues. Unfortunately, his exposure in the MSM seems to be on the wane. He still appears on the McLaughlin Group, but his former base at MSNBC has disappeared, and his exposure in the major newspapers seems non-existent. In the 1990&rsquo;s, he was a regular on the LA Times op-ed page, which seems inconceivable now&hellip; Buchanan has a very long rap sheet at the ADL.</i></p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always said that capitalism is about competition. We compete in school for the best grades; we compete to get into the best colleges and universities; we compete for jobs and we compete for promotions. The ability to compete depends on mental capacity, ability, inclination and initiative. We do not all have the same ability to compete hence the disparity in economic outcomes, standards of living and quality of life.</p>
<p>While this is true of capitalism, its also true of life in general and true in every form of government including communism. No society will ever be able to use all of its low mental capacity, low ability individuals. Many, if not most, of these low ability individuals must be &#8216;carried&rsquo; by the rest of society if they are not to perish.</p>
<p>Darwin says that one who cannot even produce what is needed to survivie SHOULD perish. We are not doing man kind any favors by carrying these folks especially given the fact the they out breed most of the rest of man kind. Darwin says that they should not survive and should not procreate.</p>
<p>However, saying that this is Darwin is a lot like saying that Newton discovered gravity. As if we would not have gravity if Newton had not discovered it.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that what Darwin &#8216;discovered&rsquo; is Mother Nature and you cannot fool Mother Nature. Those with more ability will always be the ones to survive. They will always be the ones with the highest standard of living and quality of life. Those who cannot compete, those who cannot produce even what they need to survive WILL perish in the end.</p>
<p>There will simply never be enough produced they the producers to carry all of the non producers. The non producers will perish in the end. As I said, you cannot fool Mother Nature.</p>
<p>Take as just one example what happened in Haiti. Haiti was once a very prosperous nation. When the slaves revolted most of the producers simply left. The Haitians continue to breed and they continue to perish. There is less and less money to pour into Haiti as the economy of the world worsens. The Haitians will continue to perish into extinction.</p>
<p>So take heart you producers. This country as well as the rest of the World is yours in the end.</p>

		<p>Some of you may not like Pat much, but what other conservative with views similar to ours has access to the MSM?  I don&rsquo;t   remember seeing Jared Taylor in the news earlier this year, even when he was being smeared by them.  Anyway, Pat&rsquo;s going to be on neoCON Hannity&rsquo;s Fox show on Monday.  When I&rsquo;ve seen Pat on his show, he&rsquo;s always treated Pat well.  Probably intimidated by Pat&rsquo;s superior intellect.  Hannity is one of those faux conservatives who tries to convince us that the only thing the poor, underprivileged minorities need is to embrace a conservative agenda including tax cuts even though most of them don&rsquo;t pay any taxes.  Like Thomas Sowell repeatedly saying that the problems that the poor and minorities have are caused by liberal policies.  What garbage.  I don&rsquo;t watch phony CONservative Joe Scarborough&rsquo;s show on MSNBC except sometimes when Pat is on.  I hope Pat is invited on to discuss the new book.  Can you just see Mika&rsquo;s face?  Or regulars like &#8220;Pulitizer prize winner&#8221; Eugene Robinson and John Heilemann of the far-left New York Magazine?  When a man has been smeared by CONservatives like Billy Kristol, Irving Kristol, Bill Buckley, Norman Podhoretz, Debbie Schlussel, Jack Kemp, Linda Chavez, he&rsquo;s a hero to me.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find archived podcasts of Al Sharpton&rsquo;s radio show&hellip;would you happen to have a link?</p>
<p>Re earlier posts: the many ways in which we&rsquo;re being attacked do constitute a White genocide that will be successful if not thwarted. The different components of White genocide that are discussed daily on this site are being carried out by anti-Whites who call themselves anti-racists, but as a poster noted above, anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will sign the petition to Russian President Medvedev that requests his solidarity with us in opposing White genocide. The petition is linked in post 45 above, and as is explained in the tab you&rsquo;re asked to click on, <i>you don&rsquo;t have to reveal any personal information to sign it, not even your name.</i></p>
<p>The petition is one of many attempts that are being undertaken to move into the mainstream the understanding that the White race is being genocided.</p>
<p>Please do read the petition before signing it, so that your own understanding will be deepened! The first time someone told me we were being genocided, I didn&rsquo;t buy it, but as I entertained the idea, all the racial info already in my head shifted around and fell into place and I realized the truth of the statement! I hope you will realize the truth of it too, but please don&rsquo;t be blitzed by enthusiasts like myself into not questioning it on this thread if you are doubtful!</p>

		<p>Racially speaking, small numbers of Europeans have always been able to control large groups of non-Europeans.  It&rsquo;s only when the former gives up this control that the latter takes power.  Often, this control is relinquished because of financial and logistical burdens.  The success of empires begins to have a diminishing return when controlled territories become too far-flung and expensive to maintain.  In the mid 20th Century, pressure to allott power to non-whites has also caused white power structures to weaken.  <br>
The West, of course, has now enfranchised the non-Europeans within its midst.  If, due to growing numbers, these groups take power, Western republics will collapse.  The same would happen to the democratic nations of northern Asia that are controlled by high-IQ populations if they allowed low-IQ southeast Asians to gain sway.  <br>
White people will always be the true masters of the world.  If civilization collapses, they should be able to build it back up, regardless of their numbers.  We should fight with all we have to prevent a collapse, but we must never lose heart.</p>

The survivors of the Bubonic Plague in Europe enjoyed the highest standard of living Europeans had ever enjoyed. Wages went up. Prices went down. <br>
 <br>
Despite the Great Recession, this generation of Europeans, Japanese, South Koreans, and Chinese enjoys a higher standard of living than their ancestors. One of the reasons is surely the decline in the birth rate in their countries.<br>

The relationship between population and economic well being can be described with the following equation:<br>

We compete in school for the best grades; we compete to get into the best colleges and universities; we compete for jobs and we compete for promotions. The ability to compete depends on mental capacity, ability, inclination and initiative. We do not all have the same ability to compete hence the disparity in economic outcomes, standards of living and quality of life&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, this is JUST NOT TRUE.</p>
<p>Many later-comers to &#8220;America&#8221; (at this point it has to go in quotes) were socialized into the &#8220;Melting Pot&#8221; and &#8220;Competition&#8221; rhetoric of the post-civil war Industrial Revolution. </p>
<p>This is a very specific conception of &#8220;America&#8221; generated for those brought in to fight the 1/3 of the country, the seceding states of the time, and then to work in the factories.</p>
<p>The factories and industrial revolution businesses RAN on the idea of &#8220;competition, melting pot,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>But this is only one America, and it in a sense by arguing this, you date yourself and your own trajectory to the country.   The pioneers were not born-and-bred as &#8220;competitive melting potters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Preamble clearly stated:  This is a nation FOR US AND OUR POSTERITY.  </p>
<p>The country could turn around if   &mdash;  -and only if  &mdash;  - those who came later can begin to understand their real role in the larger picture, how they were used by the ptb, why they were funded and brought, and so on.</p>
<p>The country WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT based on &#8220;competition.&#8221;   or &#8220;melting pot.&#8221;  This is later propaganda.</p>
<p>It was A PEOPLE, European people.   Later, they included others.  However, EVEN LATER decisions to include ever more different groups, to move from the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; (a frankly uneasy but doable &#8220;assimilation&#8221;) to the salad bowl that requires a gutting of self, a DE-historicizing of human life, a lost of capacity to think in cause-and-effect reality, to make it work  &mdash;  - is where we are now.</p>
<p>It was a country for A PEOPLE.   Before the Industrial Revoluton &#8220;competing with your neighbor and ugly &#8220;beating him out,&#8221; of the corporatist era, the pioneer and colonial peoples obviously did quite the opposite.    Community was absolutely necessary for their survival, and the more rural people still attempt to relate on this level today (something that is impossible when they meet with the people who come from the northeast and industrial (take from your neighbor) mindset.</p>
<p>A key to the change in the country  &mdash;  - is whether people s/a you, indoctrinated with the industrial revolution mindset, will be able to quit competing and having your children compete with other white people who built the nation and were never competing with you to begin with.   Currently, the rural, colonial, pioneer Americans are only now really in taking the industrial revolution mindset, these other whites who came to &#8220;compete&#8221; with them instead of to build a society.   They have never really begun to &#8220;compete&#8221; with you.  &#8220;Compete&#8221; is not what THEY are doing, in their own cosmology.</p>
<p>Please consider this.   And note that the constitution and other documents of the real founders SAY NOTHING about competing with other white people.  Rather, there were the networks and apprenticeships that Kevin MacDonald says were so envied by others who came, and that others wanted to rip down for their own sub-group (the Jews, Catholic nationalists, etc.)   The non-whites are not the problem in America and never have been  &mdash;    &mdash;   but rather European whites, (such as you show here) who came to the country to dispossess whites who never saw themselves as in &#8220;competition&#8221; but rather building a society, country, community in networks, apprenticeships, and so on.   The mindset of the Industrial Revolution  &mdash;  yields, buy low, sell high, live on markups and price gouging, market speculation  &mdash;  - that&rsquo;s just what others sum up as a &#8216;Yankee.&rsquo;  And that&rsquo;s all.   </p>
<p>Frankly, it was not the best of America and it&rsquo;s empire (what was built on the money collected from the heavy taxation it brought in) has been a truly mixed bag.   </p>
<p>Pat Buchanan is interesting, in that, while Catholic, he is also a Confederate connected person through his ancestry.   He is a person aware of what was just said, and yet firmly planted in the catholic mentality, (very different from many Americans who view it in a different way, from the outside, from how they have been affected).   The sort of figure who can &#8220;bridge a gap,&#8221; and see from different angles and sides, to much more of an extent.   </p>
<p>America was clearly not built on competition and melting pots.   The union government and its sweat shops, robber barron era was  &mdash;    &mdash;   but that has now passed.   One America was built on it (the northeast military taxation empire) but that is not what many experienced and they were/are not a part of it, and many don&rsquo;t even vote now, b/c they fought to not be a part of that.  <br>

Welfare was set up specifically for unwed mothers and there was a reason for that. Keep them single and pregnant because they don&rsquo;t need no daddy, government is their daddy and a steady paycheck. Part of the plan to destroy a family unit with the father in the home. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed that by now? </p>
<p>I know because I worked there for decades.  There was NO decline in sexual activity!  Quit believing what you read in the newspapers!</p>

		<p>Thanks, poster #41. From your link.</p>
<p>That Ben Wattenberg is a true enemy of Whites and our survival. READ his HATE for us in that article.</p>

Open to Greatness<br>
We need immigrants.</p>
<p>By Ben Wattenberg</p>
<p>There is a surreal quality to the freshets, streams, rivers, and oceans of words expended on the immigration issue, without a word on the big point.</p>
<p>We have heard all about the dueling studies on jobs, welfare, deportation, gangs, culture, guest-workers, and terrorism. When as astute an observer of the American scene as Robert Samuelson calls for an obscene and politically catastrophic 30-foot wall along the Mexican border, echoing an earlier position of lock-and-load Pat Buchanan, you know something is awry.</p>
<p>As it happens, I favor President Bush&rsquo;s courageous stand, but even he doesn&rsquo;t mention the big one either.</p>
<p>Namely: American greatness and influence depend on immigration and assimilation. The U.S. is the only major country in the world growing at a moderate but geometric rate, while all the others shrink, including the two great peasant giants, China and India. (If you&rsquo;re an investor, bet on India.) Europe is turning into a theme park with fewer and fewer shows and barkers.</p>
<p>If you know that American greatness, with its concomitant problems, comes from immigration and subsequent assimilation  &mdash;  immediately, or in a generation or two  &mdash;  you understand the situation. If you don&rsquo;t, ask an immigrant cab driver in any big city to explain. Immigration and assimilation are our most important comparative advantages in a roiling world. Does it cause problems? Sure. What in the realm of public policy doesn&rsquo;t? (Always answer a question with a question.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Mexican immigrants. My favorite stats come from the Defense Department, which has data on most everything except who will win the war. They calculate that Mexican-American GIs have been awarded proportionately more Congressional Medals of Honor than any other sub-group in the American military.</p>
<p>U.N. projections show America growing from 300 million to 400 million to 500 hundred million by 2300, but they underestimate.</p>
<p>America is influential now, albeit unpopular in some, but by no means all, places. The Indians like us, which is nice, because they will likely be our most important ally as the years roll on.</p>
<p>Immigrants are our best publicists. They fly home on cheap flights, they e-mail home, they use their cell phones to say America is O.K., and then some. They send home &#8220;remittances&#8221; to their families, the best form of foreign aid. Immigrants have an average age of 29. They will pay into Social Security and Medicare for 40 years before getting a nickel back. This, we want to encourage!</p>

<p>I disagree, as it is suicide not genocide.</p>
<p>I believe taking responsibility is virtue.</p>
<p>This has only happened because people allowed it to do so.</p>
<p>It really makes a mockery of the capability of us.</p>
<p>All one has to argue is that if we are great and superior then genocide would be impossible against a superior foe. And if it is genocide then we are a weaker group and who have no really great qualities that would give us a survival advantage.</p>

<p>John:</p>
<p>Reagan inherited an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent in his first month in office.<br>
By January of 1989, the unemployment rate had declined to 5.4 percent.  Had the Reagan presidency ended in 1982, when unemployment rates exceeded 10 percent, you may have had a point.  But for the remainder of Reagan&rsquo;s presidency, unemployment declined precipitously.</p>

<p>A healthy people do not commit suicide.  A blinded, drugged, brainwashed, captive people are subject to genocide.  Only they can be convinced that their extinction IS GOOD FOR THEM  (and good for the world)!</p>
<p>No healthy, sane people would buy such garbage. Obviously, it has taken many, many years of incessant propaganda to get us to this poiht, where we welcome our own demise.   We are no longer a healthy, sane people!  And when people are being force-fed national/racial  suicide, that is really &#8220;genocide&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Mr. Dumpty:   I have some comments to add to yours about &#8220;genocide&#8221;,  a word with which I have some reservations.  I think it is too strong a term for most average people - brainwashed sheeple -  to identify with or take seriously.   It sends them scooting away in derisive laughter.   They will assume you to be a paranoid looney, not anyone to be taken seriously.   &#8220;Genocide&#8221;, like  &#8220;Holocaust&#8221; is assumed to apply only to some people. They have a rigid monopoly on it, a virtual copyright.  It doesn&rsquo;t apply to whites, which is too novel a concept for most white people to &#8220;get&#8221;.     You might just as well say that,  &#8220;Hitler was right&#8221; (or some such thing).  Same result.  Alienation and derision!  Automatic rejection of your entire argument!   You have to approach the subject gently, obliquely.    In a sense, the word damages your own argument. Other people own it.  We need to use our own terminology, not theirs.  You have already admitted as much, in your own words.</p>
<p> <i>&#8220;attempts are being undertaken to move into the mainstream the understanding that the White race is being genocided. The first time someone told me we were being genocided, I didn&rsquo;t buy it, but as I entertained the idea, all the racial info already in my head   [eventually]  shifted around and fell into place and I realized the truth of the statement! </i>&#8220;</p>
<p>[But you already had A LOT more racial information in your head than MOST people do   &mdash;     as well as the capacity to sort it out.  They don&rsquo;t.] </p>
<p>Most people   &mdash;   ordinary people conditioned by TV and schoolbooks   &mdash;     will think:   Genocide???  Huh?   Whatever is this guy jabbering about?  Whites are the majority!   Whites are everywhere in charge.  Whites own the world, control the world, run the world.  Whites have all the money and all the power.   Everyone knows that  racism comes from whites, that racism is a white disease. Non-whites cannot be racist because they have no power.    Who is threatening whites?    The real problem is too much White Privilege, that&rsquo;s what. </p>
<p>Yet he claims that whites are being &#8220;genocided&#8221;.    What garbage!  Is this guy crazy? </p>

<p>Yeah? What does that mean if propaganda is effective? Wouldn&rsquo;t we not be capable of being brainwashed if we were so healthy to begin with?</p>
<p>Obviously it had to start somewhere&hellip; </p>
<p>Obviously we have guilt even before propaganda was used.</p>
<p>The only thing that hinders us is ourselves.</p>
<p>It really isn&rsquo;t a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The reason why it is happening &#8220;white&#8221; countries, is because we allot it so (out of guilt and our altruist notions).</p>
<p>Japanese is not a multicultural society (eventhough it has VERY small minorities). Guess what? </p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t think there is some people who believe that Japan should be more multicultural? Do you think that there is no one pushing it to be more multicultural?</p>

		<p>Great post Anna. You might be interested to know that one of the Popes, Pius the something, corresponded with Jefferson Davis. He couldn&rsquo;t give an open endorsement, but he obviously believed that Yankee Capitalism was a terrible and rising danger to the world - far greater than that of the slave owning South. Perhaps he knew that slavery was passing away because of machinery and that many prominent Southerners (like Lee) were opposed to it.</p>

<p>We all know the answer to that one.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, the neocons seem to be laying low immigration.  They clearly don&rsquo;t want to call attention to their open borders views now that the conservative grass roots are so riled up about illegals.  &#8220;Business interests&#8221; are doing all the heavy lifting to keep the borders open these days.  </p>

Continuosly attacking Buchanan for his connection so long ago to Nixon reminds me somewhat, of the way they bring out that old photo of David Duke in his Nazi suit every time he runs for something. One of the big reasons we never get anywhere is our propensity to magnify the flaws and overlook the virtues of the few brave souls who stick their necks out in defense of our own best interests. Shut up about Nixon and Foster already and be glad we have Pat out there doing more for our cause then any of his critics would have the brains or guts to do.</p>
<p>BRAVO FRITZ for making this point! We&rsquo;re nitpicking ourselves to death and wasting valuable time and energy by demanding perfection in public figures and candidates. PJB&rsquo;s long career, mostly on the right side of issues, deserves high praise (and damn the second guessers).</p>

		<p>Talk about the end of White America&hellip;I have seen far too many White kids and teens who go crazy over black stars and their parents approval of such insanity. I have even seen ads for new programming on TV and so many are all interracial and &#8220;gay&#8221; now.</p>
<p>How in the world are we ever going to change the mindsets of our young White kids when their own parents encourage this type of thing? </p>
<p>WATCH THIS!  Look at these two little White girls on Ellen&rsquo;s (the lesbian) show and their idol is a black &#8220;singer&#8221; who comes on and surprises them.</p>
<p>Watch that dark haired girl and how hyper she is. A sugar high or what? The little blonde girl at least isn&rsquo;t that bad.</p>
<p>Watch their parents and the one (emasculated) father crying when the girls met the black &#8220;star&#8221;..and the mothers are sooo happy and proud&hellip;.. This is what some of these insane White parents are promoting for their kids. Do anything to get fame and fortune while destroying your kids in the process.  Not to mention the parents even thinking about letting their girls go on ELLEN&rsquo;s show to begin with is unnerving to say the least&hellip;.Very sick people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many later-comers to &ldquo;America&rdquo; (at this point it has to go in quotes) were socialized into the &ldquo;Melting Pot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Competition&rdquo; rhetoric of the post-civil war Industrial Revolution. &#8220;</p>
<p>Anna, you are very right.  I&rsquo;ve been wanting to post something like this for a long time.  American Whites are really a mish mosh that does not add up to an ethnic nation.  The only Whites who are really Americans are those of the southeast whose ancestors arrived before the revolution.</p>
<p>There are some pockets of real American Yankees in the rural areas of New England.  A few Dutch descendants in upstate New York.</p>
<p>I grew up in a Chicago suburb in the 1960&rsquo;s.  I never heard anyone describe themselves as an American until I went to the University in Champaign.  Every White person in and around Chicago described themselves as Irish, Italian, German, Polish, Jewish (divided into German and Russian) Serbian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Croatian, Austrian, Bohemian, Slovak on and on and on and on and on.</p>
<p>My family was considered Irish because we went to the Catholic school and Church and did not look Italian.  Our last name was a common anglo saxon English one that no one could mistake for Irish.  But blue-eyed Catholics were either Polish or Irish and our last name was not Polish. So we were arbitarily classified as Irish.</p>
<p>Actually, our ancestors came to Maryland in the 1640&rsquo;s. I always felt a bit out of place in that Irish Italian grade school and that Irish, Italian, Jewish high school.  I was like the only American.</p>
<p>Anna is right.  White Americans are not a national group. We are a people from everywhere in Europe who never became one people.</p>
<p>By 1820 immigrants were pouring into America.  French Canadians came to the rural areas and factory towns of New England. The Irish came to Boston long before the potato famine.</p>
<p>19th century New York was a German and Irish city.  In the 20th century it was like a minature Europe with blacks. Every neighborhood was an ethnic enclave with its own language, churches, clubs, customs and occupations.</p>
<p>Before the revolution Pennsylvania was divided into 3 groups.  English quakers in Philly, German farmers and Scots Irish indian fighters in the mountains.  The English quakers despised the Scots Irish that kept Philly safe from the Indians.  The Germans kept separate German school systems into the 20th century.</p>
<p>Cleveland, Cincinnati Milwaukee, Toledo and St Louis were German in the 19th century. Chicago was mostly settled by immigrants who came off the ships and got on a train direct from  New York to Chicago.  Often they had been recruited for jobs back in Europe.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve often thought that the westward movement was because the industrialists of the east refused to hire Americans prefering cheap immigrant labor.  Most of the railroads east of the Mississippi were built by Irish recruited in Ireland.  Why not local Americans?  Because the Irish were starving because of the potato famine.  </p>
<p>It was only in the south that any native Americans worked in the coal mines.  In the north they were all immigrants.  I believe Carnegie  an immigrant himself staffed his steel mills totally with newly arrived immigrants.</p>
<p>The upper midwest was settled by Scandinavian and German immigrant farmers recruited to settle there by the transcontental railroad.  The railroads needed people along that route to survive.</p>
<p>San Francisco was always 1/3 foreign born, 1/3 children of foreing born and 1/3 native except for a very brief period in the mid 20th century due to the 1925 immigation restriction.<br>
Now San Francisco is more than half foreign born Asians.</p>
<p>The melting pot never melted this disparate conglomeration of Europeans into anything.  The immigrants quickly aquired the native born elites idea that native born White southerners<br>
were stupid hillbillies and rednecks.</p>
<p>The Democrats and liberals convinced the working and middle class immigrants that all the problems of America were caused by the evil rich WASPS code for old American of English descendant.</p>
<p>Actually, the worst capitalists were often immigrants, not old American stock wasps.</p>
<p>The cities were always sectioned into ethnic neighborhoods.<br>
Everybody got along more or less until the blacks arrived, but the Whites always stuck to their European nationality.</p>
<p>I think that Denver, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City were the only big cities that were majority White native Americans rather than immigrants clinging to their own kind.</p>
<p>Anna is also right about this idea of competitive climbing all over each other to grab the few jobs that are there.  For centuries there has been this myth of the poor immigrant who arrives with nothing but the clothes on his back ad his kids go to college and start a business whatever and become rich.</p>
<p>But there are only so many jobs. In a dog eat dog capitalist economy only some businesses will succeed.  With affirmative action for non Whites Whites will be driven to the bottom no matter how smart or hard working we are.</p>
<p>It is fine to talk about Whites uniting for the survival of our race, but Anna is right.  Whites are no more united than are European Whites.  We are just citizens of the same country.</p>
<p>We never melted.  There is a German word for the situation.  It means tossed salad.<br>

		<p>Separation is what has created diversity. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a fundamental tenet of evolution. If we consider a group of animals of the same species, of which half wander off into a different environment and stay there for long enough, then the two groups will biologically diverge from each other, since the differing pressures of their distinct environments will select different traits to prevail in each of them.</p>
<p>But if we then remove the barriers between the two groups, as has been done today in white lands by flooding those lands with massive numbers of non-whites, then the two distinct groups merge together once again.</p>
<p>We see this happening&hellip;note how many interracial couples you see today, and how many families you know personally who have mixed offspring as cousins, etc&hellip;.note the article that appeared recently on Amren about the growing number of black/white marriages in the U.S. South. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time until, as a race, we Whites will have been eliminated from existence.</p>
<p>BUT: Have we ever had a chance to vote on this flooding of our country by third worlders?? Have white Europeans ever had the opportunity to vote on the flooding of their country by third worlders??</p>

If the anti-Semites can&rsquo;t even see this simple and obvious fact then why should anyone believe what they say about Jewish influence in America?</p>

		<p>Not only will white people NOT stick together, they will be contemptuous of any political candidate who has the courage to advocate for their benefit.  </p>
<p>How many on this forum would vote for a George Wallace or David Duke?  I suspect very few. </p>
<p>Yes, both were very flawed candidates. Of course the hideous LBJ, Carter, Clinton, Nixon and both Bushes were not.  </p>
<p>By the way only Nixon, the skunk that he was, did not start a major war, he ended one, (Carter was special case). Nixon instilled fear in his enemies because they thought him a madman, thus they became cautious.  Reagan benefited in a like manner.  Carter avoided war by being a patsy. </p>
<p>I tire of the rehabilitation of fat boy Clinton.  Any positive thing he did was by accident or because it was forced on him by Newt&rsquo;s congress.  Had he had a Demonrat congress, he would have been as bad as this thing we now have. The boom in the 90s was caused in great part by Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and the maturation of the internet. </p>
<p>And yes Clinton had his major war. He attacked our allies in Serbia, the results of which gave Muslims a safe haven in Europe.  And,by the way, it is likely that Cocaine Clinton had Bin Laden in his grasp, but after millions of dollars were transferred to his Swiss account, he let him go.  </p>
<p>As I view the current crop of RepubliCons, only RINO Newt stands out as intellectually superior.  A couple of weeks ago I watched a speech he gave in which he took the hide off the present fiasco called the federal judiciary.  He nailed the problem.  Welcome to the party Newt, Wallace was saying this decades ago. </p>
<p>The thrust of his speech was that we now have a one person Constitution since one judge can decide to disregard voters wishes. </p>
<p>Remember, pop 187 in California, passed by millions of voters, was stopped by ONE &#8220;judge&#8221;.  The Arizona immigration law was stopped by ONE (idiot) &#8220;judge&#8221;.  Obumacare will be ruled constitutional or unconstitutional by one &#8220;justice&#8221;. Part of Alabama&rsquo;s immigration law was stopped by one hack in black robes.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately Newt is an admirer of Abe Lincoln, but is redeemed somewhat by his admiration of Andrew Jackson as well.  </p>
<p>Far me, Newt or perhaps, Bachmann, are the only ones worth wasting a vote on.    </p>
<p>Does Newt have a chance. Not on your life.  The average white voter will say things like, &#8220;oh he is just toomean&#8221;, &#8220;He&rsquo;s just not attractive&#8221;, &#8220;Oh he treated his ex-wife so bad&#8221;.  Of course the worthless Clinton didn&rsquo;t treat Hillary bad at all. </p>

<p>I beg to differ. My parents (at an age when most are thinking of retiring) were forced to pick up (for mom&rsquo;s health) and move from the snowy cold to California, back in the &#8216;70&rsquo;s, when it was still a lovely place to live. My dad, who had served in WWII, had only a H.S. Ed., but luckily got a CETA job as a janitor, which allowed him to then get a full-time custodial position, which allowed my mom to have a &#8216;dream home&rsquo; in CA, and where I got my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree, which then allowed me to get my Masters, and now, finally my Doctorate. We are neither black, hispanic, nor &#8216;red diaper babies.&rsquo; As a matter of fact, my parents (who came from union families) saw the unions&rsquo; nonsense back in 1968, and started voting (with Nixon) Republican, PRECISELY because of the Dems drift toward Marx, even back then. So, at least one American-American has benefited from those programs Nixon signed into law. And the other reason I THANK GOD for Richard Nixon, was that he abolished the draft, the year I turned 18. My entire adult life, my wife, family, and heritage all owe a debt of gratitude to Nixon.</p>
<p>I concur with a number of other posters on this forum. When confronted with criticism of the left, the Liberals, Marxists, and the unwashed form a block to stop all critique. Conservatives, and Republicans continually bicker and bitch and moan.</p>
<p>Whose agenda has advanced steadily year by year? Isn&rsquo;t it time we stopped fighting with each other, and stood together as a block against the Enemy?</p>

		<p>I drove the Skyline Highway in the Shennandoah Valley this past weekend. The vast majority the people on the Skyline were hindus,pakistanis,chinese and koreans. I saw young Paki couples right of the boat with three young children. At every viewing station I was a racial minority. Traffic was backed up.</p>
<p>I was thinking of visiting New Market Civil War Battlefield. I told someone in the Motel Parking lot about my plans. She told me that the Town of New Market was infested with Hispanics. This must be the reason why the Shennadoah Valley is infested with M-13. Jut before your approah the New Market Battlefield, if you look to your right off of 81, you may see all the Paki kids running around in the backyards of their homes.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, we are in a very dangerous situation demographically. So why are Pat Buchannan and Peter Brimeow only calling for a moratorium-temporary timeout on legal immigration&hellip;and stating that nonwhite immigration can commence again when unemployment drop below six percent? What Exactly would be wrong with a severe labor scarcity?</p>
<p>Pat Buchannan will spend a good portion of his book tour engaging in pychometric debates about scores on IQ tests and race and stating that science has shown that asians are more intelligent than Native Born White Americans..and as I have written many times before, there will be a massive sidetraking away from the race-replacement issue as a consequence.</p>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Pat Buchannan state emphatically in his new book that the Asians in our America are actively participating in the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Nativ Born White American engineering,technological,scientific and medical experience-future generations of Native Born White American Talent that will never be developed included.  Why didn&rsquo;t he mention the fact that Virginia&rsquo;s riparian ecosystems are being ecological destabilized by different species of asian snakehead fish that were introduced into the Potomac River by an Chinese immigrant?</p>

She was going into her car and a large black male was mastrurbating a few feet ways from her. She ran away into her friends apartment and called 911. Everyone in my family has a very sick feeling in the pit of their stomach. My sister is flipping out over this incident.</p>
<p>Since March there has been over 30 black youth gang attacks on White Americans. Why White Men continue to sit in sports  stadiums is behind my comprehension. I&rsquo;m in a state of shock at the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand why some of you have taken this article as an opportunity to question Buchanan&rsquo;s character. You don&rsquo;t have to worship the guy but he&rsquo;s on our side. He has a mainstream platform to express his views, and you&rsquo;d be hardpressed to find many more like him with opinions sympathetic to Amren and mainstream media connections. Picking him is wasted energy while our views are still so marginalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with you to an extent, and Mr. Buchanan shows no compunction to giving up regardless of ANY criticism from anywhere.  However, it real life, to have a real effect, it is important to WALK YOUR TALK.  </p>
<p>Aside from that, I think debating among ourselves is healthy, and in fact necessary, because it is very plain (at least to me) after seven years of reading and posting on Amren that a great deal of refining of our own ideas is essential if there is to be any hope.  We must be opened to thinking critically and being self-critical as well.  The opposite is following some supposed charismatic leader who  as history shows over and over will lead to even worse outcomes.</p>

<p>What a good post! Nevertheless, in the long run I believe being straightforward and calling genocide what it is will prove to be the correct tactic.</p>
<p>And for the minority of the population that studies have shown are receptive to reason, I don&rsquo;t see why my short little post #80, or my slightly longer post #4, shouldn&rsquo;t be sufficient to straighten out a person&rsquo;s thinking immediately! But of course I may have some prejudice in the matter.</p>
<p>For the much larger segment of the population that studies have shown depend on the daily repetition of ideas and phrases for the acquisition and maintenance of their beliefs, I believe that the repetition of the phrases &#8220;anti-White,&#8221; &#8220;White Genocide,&#8221; and &#8220;anti-racist is a code word for anti-White&#8221; will be critical to overturning the grip that the enemy&rsquo;s terminology of &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;bigot,&#8221; &#8220;hater,&#8221; etc. has fastened upon the popular mind. Our challenge is to get a larger and larger and larger group of people repeating the alternative ideas and phrases in the mainstream until the zeitgeist shifts.</p>
<p>The word &#8220;racist&#8221; we avoid using at all. That word belongs to the enemy. They have successfully loaded it with the baggage they want it to carry and there is no use we can make of it.*</p>
<p>The word &#8220;genocide&#8221; has also been loaded, I agree, but it&rsquo;s status is a bit different from the status of the word &#8220;racist,&#8221; and we can use for ourselves the emotional loading that our enemies have given the word! Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve written elsewhere about the two words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Genocide, the elimination of a race from existence, is a valid concept with a clear meaning that isn&rsquo;t inherently attached to one group or another. No one is going to argue that genocide can be committed only by certain races against certain other races, as is argued with the phony term, &#8220;racism,&#8221; which our enemies have succeeded in associating almost exclusively with Whites. As James Edwards brilliantly writes in his book, &#8220;Racism, Schmacism,&#8221; &#8220;If you&rsquo;re White, you&rsquo;re racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast to the clear idea of genocide, &#8220;racism&#8221; has become a phantasmagoria of imagined violations of every sort. But the term was first used by Trotsky specifically to deny the validity of racial feeling, and that is still its fundamental message. So however we might use the word, in using it we affirm and deepen the lie that racial feeling is a learned pathology, rather than an innate biological trait that evolved to protect the survival of racial groups.</p>
<p>Those two lies are two good reasons to let the word die a natural death and not lend our efforts to keeping it on life support.</p>
<p>But White genocide is our fundamental concern, since if we are successfully eliminated then all our other racial concerns will be moot.</p>
<p>Which is exactly the expressed understanding of anti-Whites who want to mix us out of existence.I&rsquo;ve heard the most ordinary but completely bewitched White anti-Whites say that the solution to the race problem is intermarriage to the point that persons who are distinctly White no longer exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree that the fact of White genocide, when properly labeled as such, will initially put some people off, but after they&rsquo;ve heard the term a couple of thousand times it will seem the most self-evident thing in the world, whether they have bothered to think about it or not!</p>
<p>For more on Bob Whitaker&rsquo;s methods, and an invitation and link to join in so that we can get to work on having everyone in this country hear the term White Genocide a couple of thousand times, will readers please refer to my post #23  to the Amren article &#8220;What Can I Do?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="/news/2011/10/what_can_i_do_1.html#comments" rel="nofollow">/news/2011/10/what_can_i_do_1.php#comments</a></p>
<p>*If called a racist, we will respond with something like, &#8220;That&rsquo;s just your opinion, and you&rsquo;re just saying that because I&rsquo;m White. You say you&rsquo;re anti-racist, but you&rsquo;re really anti-White. Anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White.&#8221; </p>
<p>Pro-Whites who have used these methods when addressing groups and individuals, and when posting in MSM, soon find the anti-Whites defending themselves against the charge of being anti-White. It&rsquo;s an approach that immediately puts us upon the moral and tactical high ground, the ground that has for so long been held by our adversaries in such exchanges, and puts our adversaries in the place that we&rsquo;ve been stuck in for so long, the place of defending oneself against the other&rsquo;s charges! More-or-less impartial bystanders feel their sympathies shifting toward the new winner! It works!</p>

Your shock should turn into anger so intense, it would burn like a themite bomb stapped to the back of one of these dirtbags after you lit the fuse. Whites need to start turning blacks&rsquo; behavoir against them, starting with refusing to charge other whites for killing them. When blacks are killed by whites, it much more likely to be self-defense than the reverse.</p>

<p>He is right to speak of &#8216;suicide&rsquo;, not &#8216;genocide&rsquo; (though they both amount to the same thing in the end - oppression of whites by their new nonwhite masters). Which GOP Presidential candidate is calling for an immigration moratorium? Worse, where is the grassroots GOP demand for such? Tea Partyers are not pro-immigration, but neither are they vociferously anti-immigration. They just don&rsquo;t get it -and they are about the best this country is offering now.</p>
<p>We need a national pro-white movement in America, one that is socially and professionally oriented towards European-Americans, as well as politically active on our behalf. We need to build white consciousness and unity, which is more important than additional racial science studies.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;As the faith that gave birth to the West is dying in the West, &#8220;&hellip;</p>
<p>This is the basic flaw of Mr. Buchanan&rsquo;s and the Christian point of view in general.  Everyone must know that the mission of Christianity, beginning with AND especially Catholicism has always been to first dominate Eruope and then the world.  Catholicism was always and ever at the frontier of every world expansion, seeking to convert and INCLUDE natives, wherever they be, into their control and world.  This worked while the West was expanding because it allowed a cover for colonizing and taking advantage of various natural wealth and labor throughout the world.  As the empires exhausted themselves, as empires always do, Christianity has become a contributor to the destruction of the West.  The mentality of core Gospel psychology is self-defeating for any wishing to thrive in the material world.  When Europeans were suffering under serfdom, peasantry, and domination by church and king, they were actively taught that this life didn&rsquo;t matter, but the next.  Christianity fought literacy, fearing the intellectual rise would threaten their control.  They next fought the printing press, then actively banned books, right up until and through the 20th century.  The reaction to a religious fiction made into a movie a few years ago brought both Mr. Buchanan out in force against it.  Why; because every historical fiction has a gem (or two) of truth in it.  Science and literature has traditionally been forced to run a gauntlet of censorship and persecution by Christianity.  So the claim that Christianity gave birth to the West is highly debatable.  The West may have utilized Christianity in subduing people once it was a  political fact, but within it was always the seeds of the West&rsquo;s demise. It is important that we soberly consider this at the time we presently find ourselves.</p>
<p>Christianity has served the West to some extant, but it suppressed the true European spirit by severing the indigenous European&rsquo;s connection to his land and past.  Typically, Christian leaders destroyed all the records of history and culture of Europeans wherever and whenever they came into power, from Alexandria and the burning of the Great Library, to Rome, to Ireland and beyond.  Then, they spent more than a thousand years attempting to root out remnants. They were never able to do it completely.  Luckily, some astute modern researchers have been able to piece some of that past together to form a meaningful understanding beyond the accusations of Inquisitors and Papal Bulls.  </p>
<p>Europeans had cultures and traditions that had existed for thousands of years that both scholastic and archeological findings have lately been increasingly finding evidences. This is why a thousand years of trying to not kill it completely.  Rejoining our genetically evolved connections to our genuine and core identity is possible.  Where Christianity supplanted it with a religion derived from non-European political and religious concerns, usurping even the spirit of the ancient sacred oak grove to create Gothic architecture for cathedrals, that spirit that whites feel and pathetically attempt to rationalize as Christian based is only nominally so.  Identifying the points of separation is going to become important as the white crisis grows.  Until then, our opponents will find it easy to defeat us in debate by exposing the obvious Christian hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Whites do indeed intermarry. But they also increasingly intermarry with non-whites. This is especially true for young whites. I grew up in a typical large metropolitan area and it was hard to find whites in their late teens are early twenties who had never dated outside their race. Race meant nothing at all for them when it came to dating. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I beg to differ. My parents (at an age when most are thinking of retiring) were forced to pick up (for mom&rsquo;s health) and move from the snowy cold to California, back in the &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, when it was still a lovely place to live. My dad, who had served in WWII, had only a H.S. Ed., but luckily got a CETA job as a janitor,&#8221;</p>
<p>Poster 87 Would you mind telling me where your Dad got a CETA job?  I saw hundreds of CETA workers infesting my County goverment building and not one was a White although blacks were only 8 percent of the county population. Only the heads of the programs were White.  The workers were all black.<br>
Poster 7.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure your Dad just did his job, but all the CETA workers ever did to me was very agressive sexual harassement and then accusations of racism because I don&rsquo;t sleep with black men or any men to whom I am not attracted.</p>
<p>The White feminazi red diaper babies  who ran the programs were always trying to get me fired for racism because I rejected the CETA black men, most of whom had extensive criminal records.</p>
<p>Not to be curious, but CETA only paid $700.00 per month.  Even then it was hard to buy a house on that which was a very low wage at the time.</p>
<p>Very few CETAs actually did real work like your Dad.  </p>
<p>They just lounged around offices all day using the phones, typewriters and copiers to advance the revolution. Another major activity was bailing the black CETA workers out of city jail when they got arrested for various crimes.  Then going to their trails to testify as character witnesses and harassing the DAs to drop the charges.</p>
<p>Your Dad was in a very different CETA that what I saw.  I observed hundreds of them in the years before Reagan thanks be to God abolished most of these programs.  </p>
<p>The head of the whole program for my county was a White man who had served a sentence for murder in San Quentin.  While there the Prison Law Project run by marxists Charles Garry and  Faye Stender ( Huey Newton&rsquo;s lawyer and lover) converted him to revolution and marxism.</p>
<p>Of course they needed a White guy who could memorize the script and speak understandable English.</p>
<p>I will always loathe Nixon because he ruined a perfectly nice job for me by loading up my agency with those blacks and marxists. I loathe him as much as I loathe the CETAs, EEOPs and others who made my life miserable for 10 years.</p>
<p>One of them planted a bomb in a police station and murdered one and blinded another police officer while on the federal CETA payroll.  Were it not for Nixon, she would not have been there.<br>
Nor would she have had a salary to live on.</p>

		<p>The U.S. is moving toward a system in which the government presides over a number of different social groups, some of which have their own language and type of education. This approach undermines social unity and allows construction of a multicultural society, which is the very opposite of America&rsquo;s previous practice. The government aims to supervise these different groups and keep the peace by redistributing income from one to another.</p>
<p>Thus the utopia of multiculturalism involves a bureaucratic class presiding over a nation divided into a variety of ethnic nationalities. That, of course, looks awfully like the old Soviet Union. Such a system cannot work, and its failure is likely to inflict great damage on the people, their traditions, and their liberties.</p>

		<p>#75 With regards to <i> &ldquo;The non-Europeanization of America is heartening news of an almost transcendental quality,&rdquo; Wattenberg trilled.4 Yet, one wonders: What kind of man looks with transcendental joy to a day when the people among whom he was raised have become a minority in a nation where the majority rules?&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>You must understand that Benjamin Wattenberg apparently never considered himself to be an european. He is thus merely celebrating the advancement of his self-interests. </p>
<p>#88 American whites are horribly atomized. They are not connected to each other in a wider context as in they do not share blood (and a common phenotype) - one american white may be a scot-irish-spaniard while another is a croat-polack-lithuanian. They do not share a common history beyond a couple of generations at best.  They are not connected to the land in the sense that their ancestors lived on it for thousands of years. They do not share religion - its not merely protestant vs catholic but a multitude of religious sects versus another. <br>
IMHO, the american experiment have yielded tangible results and they are horrible to behold. </p>

<p>What a good post! But I believe that calling White Genocide by its proper name is the correct tactic.</p>
<p>For the segment of the population that are receptive to reason, there are reasons aplenty as seen in posts on this thread.</p>
<p>For the segment of the population that depend on the repetition of ideas and phrases for their beliefs, repetition of the phrases &#8220;anti-White,&#8221; &#8220;White Genocide,&#8221; and &#8220;anti-racist is a code word for anti-White&#8221; may in time overturn the present loaded terminology of &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;bigot,&#8221; &#8220;hater,&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genocide&#8221; is a loaded term also, I agree, but in its case we can use for ourselves the emotional loading that the word has been given! The elimination of a race from existence is a clear concept that isn&rsquo;t inherently attached to one group or another. No one is going to argue that genocide can be committed only by certain races against certain other races, as is argued with the phony term, &#8220;racism,&#8221; which our enemies have succeeded in associating almost exclusively with Whites.</p>
<p>I agree that labeling White Genocide properly will initially put some people off, but after they&rsquo;ve heard the term a couple of thousand times, the fact of White Genocide will seem self-evident, whether they&rsquo;ve bothered to think about it or not!</p>

<p>&#8220;Typically, Christian leaders destroyed all the records of history and culture of Europeans wherever and whenever they came into power, from Alexandria and the burning of the Great Library, &#8220;</p>
<p>The library was burnt by the Caliph of Egypt because there was a severe cold wave cerca 750 AD long after the muslim conquest.  The books were burnt for fuel.  When the scholars protested, the Caliph said &#8220;the koran is the ony book we need.&#8221;  You&rsquo;ve been reading too much Voltaire.</p>
<p>Gutenberg was a Catholic who attended Catholic schools.  The first book he printed was a Catholic bible and the Church backed him 100 percent.</p>
<p>Before Gutenberg the priests and monks printed wood cut books.<br>
Half the page was a picture the other half printed.  The words were cut into the wood, the wood was pressed into ink and printed on the page.  The monks also invented 3 inch handles with individual letter stamps on the bottom.  The letters were lined up in a slot.  The writer picked up a letter, pressed it on ink and then on the page. A slow and tedius way of printing a book.</p>
<p>Those stamps were the forerunner of Gutenberg&rsquo;s printing press.</p>
<p>It was the early Catholics cerca 300AD who actually invented the book as opposed to the scroll.  The early Catholic scholars invented pages sewn together and bound with covers into a book.  The early Catholic scholars invented the table of contents, the index, chapters and paragraphs. </p>
<p>How can you say the Catholics were against books when they invented books?  How can you say Catholics were against books when until the invention of the printing press every book in the world was written and bound in monasteries and Catholic universities? </p>
<p>The vatican library goes back to the earliest days, the days of the apostles.  Ever heard of St Lawrence the patron saint of libraries? When Christianity was still illegal the Romans used to raid the Christian libraries.  He was killed in one of those raids.  He was the librarian.</p>
<p>It was the Christian and Catholic monasteries who for 1500 years sat in their cold libraries and copied books. Were it not for them there would be nothing of the ancient literature.</p>
<p>As for science, virtually all of the scientific discoveries came from Christian Europe, many of them long before 1800.</p>
<p>Ever heard of scholastisim?  Cerca 1100 AD system developed in the monastery libraies.  Known nowdays as the scientific method.<br>
Start with small discoveries, test them throughly, prove them and go on to the next.  Never have pre conceived notions.  Let the experiment play itself out. Accept what the experiment shows.  </p>
<p>Modern Chemistry developed from alchemy.  Physics developed from the medieval question &#8220;how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?&#8221;  In scientific terms, how small is small.  These experiments lead to the discovery of molecules.</p>
<p>Monks were using eyeglasses back in the 1200&rsquo;s.  It was a monk who invented the rifle or musket.  It was monks who traveled to China cerca 500 Ad and smuggled back silkworms.  Monks who developed windmills and water mills to a very sophisticated degree. </p>
<p>Some of the greatest engineering feats in the world are the cathederals.  I&rsquo;m not talking about their appearance but the sheer engineering genius of building those huge 100 foot ceiling hollow spaces.</p>
<p>I totally agree with you that Christianiti&rsquo;s universal view is completely anti White and detrimental to Whites today. The Christians don&rsquo;t want us any more.  Christians want helpless losers who can hardly feed themselves.</p>
<p>I agree with you that it was European intelligence, creativity and hard work that produced the scientific and other discoveries, not the Church so much.</p>
<p>I agree with you that Whites need to completely get away from Christianity.  Chrisianity is as much our enemy as is marxism and cannibal capitalism.</p>
<p>I think you have been reading too much John Calvin, John Knox, Voltaire and masonic literature.  Wicca and neo paganism is not the answer.</p>
<p>Religion has nothing to to with White survival in the face of genocide.  Christianity is true to itself.  It is universal.  It wants the rest of the world and is happy to throw European Christians under the bus if they can convert 5 billion asians, afrians and indians.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an atheist.  I&rsquo;m also a historian and I have balanced the rantings of Calvin, Knox and Voltaire with knowledge of what actually went on in medieval times.</p>
<p>Christianity won&rsquo;t help us.  Capitalism wants us dead so it will have no rivals.  Neo paganism may be a nice hobby or a fulfilling religion, but it won&rsquo;t help us either.</p>

<p>One thing I like about using the correct term &#8220;genocide&#8221; is that it gets well out in front of the present position. And as you say in different words, it claims territory that has been loosely under the enemy&rsquo;s dominion, but which the enemy can&rsquo;t very well defend as its own preserve. </p>

		<p>I agree more with #79 than #88.  White Americans are not an ethnic group.  Between different religions, the huge size of the country and especially the competition among the immigrant groups for jobs we are not cohesive.</p>
<p>Maybe in another 500 years with lots of intermarriage we might become cohesive.  In New England there are plenty of people who call themselves French Canadien and others who call themselves Yankees even though their ancestors arrived in the 1600&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>#79 is right that many Whites still identify as Irish English Italian whatever when asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Dumpty: I have some comments to add to yours about &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;, a word with which I have some reservations. I think it is too strong a term&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I`ve found that a very effective tactic against white genocide deniers is to simply state the facts:</p>
<p>&#8220;Genocide is genocide,whether accomplished by bullets,mustard gas,or mass immigration and social engineering.</p>
<p>Article II: In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a single anti-white has tried to refute this,because they know they CAN`T.The definition of effectiveness should be conveying our message in such a way that the the enemy will not contest it in front of our fellow white citizens,not whether you THINK it`s &#8220;too strong&#8221; or not.<br>

<p>Thanks, poster #41. From your link.</p>
<p>That Ben Wattenberg is a true enemy of Whites and our survival. READ his HATE for us in that article.</p>
<p><br>
Thanks #66 for that dose of unadulterated Wattenberg. It is always illuminating to hear the &#8220;right-wing&#8221; Open Borders enthusiasts in their own words. Words that are, IMHO, as idiotic and as reality-challenged as those of LEFT-wing Open Borders enthusiasts. Neither group has any REAL idea of what they&rsquo;re talking about. </p>
<p>Know what I would like to do to every one of these WSJ types? I would like to make them live for two years   &mdash;   as I did in the early 2000s   &mdash;   in a Mexican barrio in East LA. I would like Ben Wattenberg to live for 24 months in my old apartment with the &#8220;scratchiti&#8221; on the living-room window, and obey all the House Rules dictated by the Mexican super and his wife. Rules like &#8220;No noise after 8pm, but prior to 8pm all the noise you want&#8221;. I would like every member of the WSJ&rsquo;s mestizo-lovers to live directly above the Mexican family who used to live under me, who would pound their ceiling starting at 8:01 pm if I had my radio loud enough to be able to hear it. (Hey, it&rsquo;s not my fault our shared 1920s lowrise was constructed entirely of papered-over Popsicle sticks.) Papacito, like most Mex men, had to be up early in the AM to go to work. LA, like most cities, has no-noise laws that come into effect after 11pm. Doesn&rsquo;t matter: when ANY group achieves a local supermajority, that group feels they can now make their own rules &amp; reg&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>That said, I would like to make it clear that I don&rsquo;t hate Mexicans. I certainly don&rsquo;t LIKE them, and I don&rsquo;t want them in the US, but I don&rsquo;t hate them. I reserve my hatred for those who are actively Evil (G. Soros, for one). The Mexicans in the SW   &mdash;   and, increasingly, the country as a whole   &mdash;   aren&rsquo;t deliberately trying to annoy us or destroy us. Hispanics only persist in the their annoying and destructive habits because their IQ limits them to bettering themselves. IOW, yes, they&rsquo;re a problematic and undesirable immigrant group, but they can&rsquo;t help it. They can&rsquo;t help being unfit for 21st C living any more than I can help being unfit for acceptance to MIT&rsquo;s Particle Physics program. </p>
<p>I dare Wattenberg or any of his pro-pachuco ilk to walk the walk. Two years at my old address and ANYBODY from the WSJ would dump their Open Borders mania. </p>
<p>Pat Buchanan understands the situation. Ben Wattenberg doesn&rsquo;t. </p>

<p>As he was talking about the decline of America he mentioned the racial aspect and we are all forming into ethnic enclaves. He mentioned &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and how many we are allowing into the country. George, of course, the liberal he is, said illegal immigrants you mean? Pat said yes, but that the legal immigrants are numbering about 1 to 2 million a year. George then said, well it is so sad that illegals only come here because they WANT to work and send money home to their poor families. Pat said yes, that is true and it is &#8220;tragic&#8221;. Like they are the poor little victims&hellip;</p>
<p>Pat went on to say, that he thinks we need a moratorium on Legal immigration for just a &#8220;few&#8221; years BECAUSE of our high unemployment rate, THEN we can go back and allow the numbers that we are now! Not a word about how Whites are being displaced by allowing NONWHITES into our country! Not a word about how much it is costing US in so many ways to allow all these millions of nonwhite immigrants into our country.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s utterly undeniable that Jews are the most influential group across the entire mass media in America and on Wall St. and that they use this influence to advance their own interests and to undermine the interests of whites.  Anyone who wants to deny or downplay this is working against whites and has no place in the pro-white movement.    </p>

<p>If Pat Buchannan did say that about legal immigation I am not the least bit shocked..that&rsquo;s exactly what the moratorium is all about:eventual race-replacement. And Pat Buchannan of course was tutored on the virtues of the moratorium by Peter Brimelow. Peter Brimelow is more interested in reviving the moribund Republican Party than reversing race-replacement. The moratorium concedes one of our most powerfull debating points which is that a severe labor scarcity would be a great benefit to millions of Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>Who knows what Pat Buchanan might have said in his book and what its title might have been (&#8220;The Genociding of the White Race&#8221;?) if publishers were willing to publish the truth. Just look at the problems Jared Taylor and others have had trying to get the truth published. Maybe we should just praise Buchanan for doing as much as he did, though things being published one after another that fall short of the full truth also strengthen public belief that the full truth must not be true.</p>
<p>We must simply keep pushing everywhere to give the full truth increasing traction.</p>

<p>Our present dilemma is not an accident or error.  The sheep, who we interact with daily, are shallow, self-absorbed weapons used to further an agenda.  For them, &#8220;fitting in&#8221; trumps everything.  For us, it is a slow and painful death.  There no longer is another place to run to.<br>

Pat Buchanan understands the situation. Ben Wattenberg doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Jack replies:</p>
<p>No you are wrong Ben Wattenberg (is he still alive?) understands the situation and he like Tim Wise does not like White America. We have to fight for the legitimate rights of our people and understand that for many historic reasons, lots of racial and ethnic groups have intense hatred of White Americans - it&rsquo;s not a misunderstanding. They know what they are doing.</p>

		<p>People here are nit picking about something small that Pat Buchanan feels he has to say just to maintain some presence on the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan is 100% on our side. So is Peter Brimelow.</p>
<p>Pat Buchanan should now be the very powerful Republican governor of New Hampshire, building a powerful state party of young office holders making New Hampshire our state.</p>
<p>Tom Tancredo should be the very powerful Republican Governor of Colorado doing the same.</p>
<p>Ideological Libertarian, constitutionalists always convince our best, most competitive leaders to do foolish things like run for President of the United States on 3rd party tickets or else they are obsessed with hearing ideological purity on some late night cable news show.</p>
<p>We need to compete to win real power. The best strategy is to go local as our kinsmen in the US South have now done.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not going to be given it all in some easy way, like having a nice, honest 80 year old Libertarian Constitutionalist just given the US Presidency and making everything like it&hellip;</p>
<p>used to be.</p>
<p>The past is history.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg to differ. My parents (at an age when most are thinking of retiring) were forced to pick up (for mom&rsquo;s health) and move from the snowy cold to California, back in the &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, when it was still a lovely place to live. My dad, who had served in WWII, had only a H.S. Ed., but luckily got a CETA job as a janitor, which allowed him to then get a full-time custodial position, which allowed my mom to have a &lsquo;dream home&rsquo; in CA,&#8221;</p>
<p>Poster # 7 replies:</p>
<p>I forgot to mention Nixon&rsquo;s Philadelphia plan.  That act of vicious discrimination against the White middle class was not an order by some judicial dictator but cooked up by Nixon&rsquo;s inner circle (which included Buchanan) and implemented by the Nixon White House, not EEOC and the judiciary.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia plan was a direct attack on private sector unions.  American unions now consist of affirmative action alternative to welfare slugs, but back in the day the unions were the only defense workers had against cannibal capitalism.</p>
<p>Nixon&rsquo;s Philadelphia plan forced the highly skilled construction unions to accept totally unqualified blacks.  Carpenters who did not know and could not be taught to measure and add and subtract fractions.  Commercial industrial electricians who could not read or learn the building codes that kept buildings from burning down because of shoddy electrical work.</p>
<p>The only thing employers liked about the construction unions is that the workers were higly skilled and more importantly worked very hard and fast.  Even today, with $8.00 dollar an hour illegal indians available at every 7-11 parking lot, union workers are more cost effective.  They  complete construction projects on time and according to code, a contrast to the endless delays and mistakes by the indians.</p>
<p>Central American indians and hispanics at least work and follow directions.  But we all know the work ethic of blacks.  The Philadelphia plan was before hispancis and asians were declared an affirmative action group.  So the Philadelphia plan brought into the construction unions blacks who could never learn the basics and spent their day chuckling, chortling, chatting and flailing their arms and legs about.</p>
<p>We all know how blacks behave in the workplace.  Just what iron workers need, some guy so engrossed in his babbling that he backs up into you and shoves you off a 20 story beam. An electrician who causes an electrical fire.</p>
<p>The basement of the Moscone convention center in San Francisco flooded and the whole project had to be closed down for a week and completion was delayed for a couple months because of some stupid mistake by a black electrician who should have never become a commerical industrial inside wireman foreman.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lucky no one was killed by the live wires and water in that basement.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia plan really was the begining of the end for the highly skilled unions where admission was based on merit, ability to measure, spatial relations and other skills, ability to read and learn building codes and blue prints, first aid and safety such as concentrate not yap and yak when handling live electrical wires.</p>
<p>If you read some of Buchanan&rsquo;s early works he is so very proud of the Philadelphia plan of Nixon&rsquo;s.  I don&rsquo;t know if he helped develop it, but he sure advocated it. Liek all the other conservatives, Buchanan is ferociously anti union.  Conservatives are anti union because they help the workers.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia plan was as destructive as the EEOC, Griggs vs duke power and Kaiser vs weber to the White american worker.<br>
It was Nixon&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>Many people and I am one of them think that affirmative action for every ethnic group and gender on earth was created in a cannibal capitalist think tank, not some liberal advocates of opressed blacks.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that CETA helped on White family.  Your Dad was lucky he was not surrounded by black panthers and criminals just out of prison.  I know that the CETA program recruited blacks while they were still in prison.  CETA marxists like the Prison Law Project Whites often promised the CETA job to a black prisoner before his parole hearing.  They would then appear at the parole hearing and argue that he should be released on parole because he had the CETA job waiting.</p>
<p>Conservatives are not the friends of White Nationalists.</p>

<p>Your statement is so silly it&rsquo;s barely worth a response.</p>
<p>I wonder why so many sound investment institutions and businesses that have long records of success eschew government statistics and instead rely on economic and financial statistician John Williams&rsquo; reports instead?   </p>
<p>Do you really believe the government is counting unemployment statistics correctly? Do you believe the government&rsquo;s contention that the economy is improving, jobs are being created and the dollars is sound? Do you think flooding the economy with monopoly money is a good thing?  Have you seen the price of gold?  Why are the Chinese rumbling about dropping the dollar as the reserve currency if it&rsquo;s as sound as the feds keep telling us it is?</p>
<p>He John Williams lying when he reports the following?</p>
<p><i>Up until the Clinton administration, a discouraged worker was one who was willing, able and ready to work but had given up looking because there were no jobs to be had. The Clinton administration dismissed to the non-reporting netherworld about five million discouraged workers who had been so categorized for more than a year.</i></p>
<p>Given John Williams&rsquo; reputation and thorough research and the fed&rsquo;s tendency to lie to the American people, I&rsquo;ll use John Williams stats to guide my investments and business.</p>
<p>Good luck to those who depend on manipulated government stats and a willing media to guide their financial future. </p>

<p>The sheep need new shephards! And that would be us.</p>
<p>The sheep have always been sheep and always will be, and we accomplish little by bemoaning that while schizophrenically addressing them with reasoning.</p>
<p>A master of psychological warfare, who worked in that field for the U.S. government and whose site I linked above, Bob Whitaker, has developed methods for reaching the sheep that are proving very effective.</p>
<p>The simple but fundamental message of White Genocide is repeated over and over, sticking to the careful phrases that have shown themselves to be successful, &#8220;anti-White,&#8221; &#8220;pro-White,&#8221; and &#8220;White Genocide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our enemies have understood the power of a single fundamental message delivered with single phrases: If you walk into a room and speak any random racial truth, the mind of every sheep in that room fills with the same thought and the same phrase, &#8220;[r-word!!],&#8221; and your argument is defeated before it&rsquo;s out of your mouth! </p>
<p>The important part of Jared Taylor&rsquo;s term &#8220;Race Realism&#8221; is the word &#8220;realism.&#8221; Advertising psychologists would consider us bumbling unrealistic kindergartners in the art of &#8220;communication.&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;t takes about 15 minutes at Bob&rsquo;s site to start using his methods and sense their power, and to see the scope they offer for your intelligence and creativity!</p>

		<p>Back in my student days, I worked for a short time for the state agency that ran the Massachusetts CETA program.  As I recall, it was common for &#8220;participants&#8221; to cheat, as follows:  they were granted unemployment payments after their work stints ended, for the same length of time as the work stint.  I think they spent 6 months working and 6 months on unemployment.  Then, they could repeat the pattern with another 6 months working and 6 months paid idleness.  These people didn&rsquo;t even try to use their experience as a steppingstone to a real job, as the program intended.</p>
<p>The cheaters seemed mostly male.  The women in CETA were largely ex-housewives who suddenly found themselves in need of skills and real jobs.  I didn&rsquo;t know much about the racial distribution, but do recall a lot of French surnames, which I naively assumed were French Canadian.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recall any feminazis or red diaper babies among the admins.  They seemed a mix of young townies and suburbanites who went drinking and dancing after work, and prissy older women who studied accounting in the fifties.  There was a constant mess of foulups involving late documents, blame-passing, and suspicious firings.  </p>

		<p>John Englemann &#8220;the crime rate is declining.&#8221;</p>
<p>John, you can&rsquo;t rely on crime statistics.  Ever heard of multiple charges for the same offense and plea bargaining?</p>
<p>A criminal enters a home, beats and seriusly injures the residents, rapes one of the women and gets away with several thousand dollars worth of electronics, cash and jewelry.</p>
<p>In the big cities whose courts are overwhemled with criminal cases, that criminal can plead to  breaking and entering or even criminal trespass.</p>
<p>Rape is often pled down to sexual assault that can mean anything from rape to pawing a women standing on a bus.  What sexual assault is defined as depends on the state law.</p>
<p>Attempted murder, great bodily injury, mayhem and armed robbery are often pled down to robbery.</p>
<p>Many crimes are pled down to simple weapons charges, unregistered guns, discharging a firearm within city limits, carrying without a permit.</p>
<p>The good thing about all these complicated firearm laws is that criminals don&rsquo;t obey them any more than they obey traffic laws.</p>
<p>Ordinary citizens fill out all the firearms forms, pay the fees, wait out the waiting period, don&rsquo;t carry without a permit, don&rsquo;t <br>
discharge firearms within city limits, lock them in a locked box in the trunk of a car if that is the state law.</p>
<p>Criminals, especially blacks ignore all these laws.  So they often plead guilty to some simple firearms regs offense.  This is good because they are sent to prison where they can&rsquo;t commit crimes for a while. </p>
<p>Attempted murder can be and is often pled down to discharging a firearm within city limits, possession of an unregistered firarm and concealed carry without a permit.</p>
<p>Of all races, blacks are the most likely to own a firearm.  Most of these firearms are unregistered and purchased privately or stolen. if you can&rsquo;t get them on attempted murder, get them on the firearm regs they ignore.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t believe the statistics.  Don&rsquo;t believe these superficial internet sites either.</p>

<p>I also throw in a few easily verifiable, indisputable facts about the situation for Whites in South Africa and tell &#8216;em this is where WE are headed.</p>
<p>You might also bring up the Wichita Massacre, Knoxville Atrocity and/or Duke non-Rape case and then throw it in their ball-court   &mdash;   ask why they believe the media refuse to report black-on-White rapes, murders, tortures?  You can add the DOJ/FIB stats   &mdash;   government figures   &mdash;   about black-on-White vs. the reverse crime rates. (I&rsquo;ve used this when posting on mainstream sites, I CONSTANTLY see, undisputed, in  comment sections &#8220;Whites are more violent than blacks!&#8221;).</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t let these things pass!</p>
<p>If you need more, (most people watch TV)   &mdash;  ask why Whites are portrayed as boobs, idiots and fools on TV.  Or mention that 90% of sanctioned immigration is non-White.</p>
<p>That White are becoming a minority in the US cannot be hidden, the evidence is massive and in plain sight in front of anyone&rsquo;s eyes!  Non-Whites make up 1/3 of the population of the US, are increasing, are everywhere, are a burden and are hateful toward Whites.  Ask why they believe Whites are not allowed to form advocacy groups to promote the interests of Whites.  </p>
<p>Ask if they believe what the media tell them   &mdash;    that any time Whites gather it is for the formation of a Fourth Reich, K gathering, or skin-head type group and soon the ovens will be fired up!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one minute to midnight, we are losing our country while the likes of Zerobama and Holder lord over us.   Geez, I wish more Whites would wake the hell up.  What will it take, wholesale killing? </p>

<p>Derek Black, a young pro-White activist who was elected to the local Republican Committee in West Palm Beach, Florida (but who was not allowed to take his seat), speaks before many groups of people, and at the recent pro-White &#8220;Practical Politics and Leadership Seminar&#8221; he described how Whitaker&rsquo;s methods have completely transformed the degree to which he&rsquo;s able to reach his audiences. His excitement was evident.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been posting with Whitaker&rsquo;s bugsters to mainstream articles for awhile now, and everything you and others have said on this thread about the experience is accurate.</p>
<p>I think Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s limited points will on the whole be very beneficial to the pro-White movement. But while we don&rsquo;t all have Buchanan&rsquo;s position and ability <i>as a single person</i> to reach and affect his huge audience, as a group working together with Bob Whitaker&rsquo;s methods we <i>do</i> have the ability to reach huge audiences with the much more complete truth.</p>
<p>I hope readers here will go to the links you gave and check out what Bob and we bugsters are doing, and jump in and give it a try! <br>

Harumph! ARod, in your original post you extol free speech but end with the conclusion that dissenters from your views must be stifled! Lol, ARod! In similar fashion, anti-Whites like yourself extol the virtues of &ldquo;anti-racism&rdquo; but support programs that further White Genocide!</p>
<p>As cBear says, anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White.</p>
<p>Pro-Whites support the preservation of ALL races, because we enjoy the diversity of races and cultures on this planet.</p>
<p>We understand that separation created diversity and that separation maintains diversity. In other words, we understand the Theory of Evolution, which is among the many things that anti-Whites hate! Lol! And harumph!</p>
<p>Anti-Whites like yourself need to wake up and stop supporting White Genocide under the guise that you are anti-racist!</p>
<p>But you and I do have one thing in common, ARod: we both hate these stinking predatory banks and the politicians who have been corrupted by their money to let them loot, loot, and loot some more!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re anti-White and they&rsquo;re pro White-Genocide.</p>

<p>SO much fun! So far, I&rsquo;ve gotten NO ONE AT ALL who will argue with any of the bugster-type posts I&rsquo;ve posted in the MSM. Part of the impact is that I&rsquo;m posting with other bugsters who are using the same style, but it&rsquo;s also that the anti-Whites don&rsquo;t know what the devil to say! They certainly USED to have plenty to say, before I started using Whitaker&rsquo;s format! The content is mostly my same old content or my own new content, but re-formatted to the bugster style.

		<p>#78: I never watched the &#8220;Ellen Degenerate Show&#8221;, nor would I ever entertain the idea of watching such garbage.</p>
<p>All of these cheap Talk Shows are scripted so they get the end result that they want, such as White teenaged girls swooning over some just-released black Felon. </p>
<p>Maury Povitch is another garbage Show that stinks up the Air Waves. Again, it is all scripted for the weak minded who actually buy this crap; the &#8220;Married with Children&#8221;, and &#8220;American Dad&#8221; crowd. These people really are brain dead. </p>
<p>Forrest Gump said, &#8220;Stupid is as stupid does&#8221;, so what do you expect stupid people to do? </p>
<p>The good news here is that we have total control over what we allow into our homes on the television, and radio. Complete control. </p>
<p>No one forces any of us to watch this cow pile called a Television Show, and we could get the word out to others to avoid it entirely, as it is poisonous to the minds of impressionable children, and teens.</p>
<p>My children have never watched the horse manure that disguises itself as entertainment. They watch Classic movies, with the great Stars that could actually act. Movies that reflect America at its best is all they have ever seen, and now, all they will except to view.</p>
<p>The same goes for music. They were never allowed to listen to the ear busting, nerve shattering, ghetto trash, or what passes as music such as Alternative, etc. Not in my home, and certainly not my children. </p>
<p>This was also followed by my family and friends, who also forbid this kind of trash on Television, or on the CDs their kids bought. </p>
<p>When these same children were taught the violin, flute, guitar, piano, at a young age, and then directed toward their own hertitage&rsquo;s ethnic music, they gained an identity that cannot be readily stripped away. </p>
<p>We need to educate our children at the earliest ages, and maintain that education through movies, music, and books. </p>
<p>They need to know the truth right from the beginning, and they need you to teach them. </p>
