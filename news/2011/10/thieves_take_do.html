<h1>Thieves Take Douglass High&rsquo;s Football Gear Right Before Homecoming</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chastity Pratt Dawsey, Detroit Free Press, September 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Stolen football equipment threatened not only the season but also Friday&rsquo;s big event at Frederick Douglass College Preparatory Academy for Young Men  &mdash;  the Detroit school&rsquo;s Homecoming game.</p>
<p>As the junior varsity football team prepared to pack up equipment Monday afternoon and head out for a game, coaches discovered the field house had been broken into and looted. Again. The school canceled the JV game.</p>
<p>The looted field house already was a virtual shell because electrical wiring, copper plumbing and toilets had been stolen three years ago. This time, thieves made away with the students&rsquo; pads, helmets, some shoes and footballs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Frederick Douglass College Preparatory Academy for Young Men in Detroit is only about four years old, but the football team already has endured its share of hardship.</p>
<p>The Hurricanes&rsquo; undefeated season was taken away last year after the school was charged with playing an ineligible transfer student. Three coaches were fired last season when background checks showed they had felony convictions.</p>
<p>And this year, the players are nomads, roaming from school to school to play home games because their own field is in disrepair.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Douglass is a small school with about 225 students in grades 6-12. They wear neckties and blazers daily.</p>
<p>The school has met federal academic goals for Annual Yearly Progress for two of the last three years. {snip}</p>
<p><br>
Last year, parents ran extension cords to the press box so they could call the game over a microphone, said Wanda Dixon, president of the school&rsquo;s parent group.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an all-boys school with youth who have determination, goals and aspirations, and are not just out on the streets sagging,&#8221; said Dixon, whose son Marquise Poole plays on the varsity team. &#8220;Why would somebody steal from them?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: According to this site, Douglas High&rsquo;s student body is 99.1 percent black and has only one white student.</em>]</p>

		<p>Frederick Douglas would be proud. This is why the black man will never build anything of value his predatory instincts are to keen and his intelligence to dull to understand the long term ramifications of these actions. </p>
<p>We are faced with either building our own homeland or entering the slow decent that will follow once the black man takes charge. Look at South Africa look at Zimbabwe, look at Detroit, look at Atlanta, look at Memphis.</p>

<p>Years ago my high school football team played a game against and an almost all-black team from another high schoo&rsquo; on the south side of Chi. There was one white white kid on the almost all-black team and he of course played quarterback. Maybe this is the case here too? </p>

		<p>I really feel for these kids.  It sounds like a good school, (except for the felon coaches) but not to have a home field and have your equipment stolen?  That&rsquo;s just wrong!</p>

		<p>If the coaches themselves in the recent past have been revealed to be felons then maybe the current theft is just an inside job. The people working for the school team have the information to pass along to the actual perpetrators. It may not have been just blind luck on the part of the thieves.</p>

		<p>Before you get all weepy there CDE two answers need to be obtained.  WHY do they not have a field of their own?  Answer:  because like everywhere else in Detroit, they did not KEEP IT UP THEMSELVES.  Next WHO stole the equipment?  Answer:  if not somebody from the school, then somebody from the hood.  In other words, it wasn&rsquo;t the ONE White kid at the school.  </p>

<p>Sam Kinison couldn&rsquo;t come up with a better name. Every AR reader has this place pegged.</p>
<p>Anyway, if the school administrators had any brains they&rsquo;d dump the football program entirely and focus on academics. (Right)</p>
<p>This is just Africa on Lake Michigan - another fancy-named failing black &#8220;high school&#8221; filled with low IQ felon-breeders. And the morons giving donations only encourage future crime. </p>
<p>This whole story is a microcosm of black America - there is nothing positive.</p>

<p>Do a little digging, and you&rsquo;ll find the cheating.</p>
<p><i>Frederick Douglass College Preparatory Academy for Young Men</i></p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s URL is part of the Detroit Public Schools system, so it&rsquo;s a public high school.  Feminists usually have a bovine unit about single-gender education, yet I&rsquo;m not reading any complaints about this prestigious academy only for young men and felonious football coaches.</p>
<p><i>This is an all-boys school with youth who have determination, goals and aspirations, and are not just out on the streets sagging</i></p>
<p>Not sagging your pants in public isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;goal&#8221; or an accomplishment indicative of determination or aspirations.  It&rsquo;s a minimum expected standard of behavior, especially for &#8220;college bound young men.&#8221;  To laud the students for not sagging would be as insightful as lauding the football team for &#8220;trying hard.&#8221;  They&rsquo;re supposed to try hard, the objective is to win games.</p>

<p>HOWEVER! officials have noted that the &#8220;one white kid&#8221; is still a person of interest and the investigation will continue until some means of blaming the one white kid of the theft is discovered or created! I do feel for the one white kid though, his/her parents should be waterboarded.</p>

<p>Why were they not vetted before they were hired as they are in most school districts?</p>
<p><i>thieves made away with the students&rsquo; pads, helmets, some shoes and footballs</i></p>
<p>A brand new set of olympic weights, weight benches and weight racks were stolen from a school I worked at the night of the day they were delivered.  They had been donated and were very expensive.  Right before that, an entire shipment of sewing machines, still in boxes, was stolen from a storage room. I suspect both &#8220;burglaries&#8221; were inside jobs.  One guess as to the color of the after-hours cleaning crew.</p>
<p><i>Electrical wires stolen right off the pole, aluminum bleachers gone over night, copper plumbing stolen</i></p>
<p>Well, the price of metals HAS surged lately as the US dollar continues to fall.  Maybe these thieves are smarter than we think and don&rsquo;t believe a word the Ben Bernach says about the US economy and dollar being sound.  Has the price of her-ron surged as well?</p>

		<p>I was getting my teeth cleaned and the hygienist asked me what school I went to. I told her and she said,&#8221;Oh, that is not a good school. My kids had a soccer game there and there was so much broken glass on the field the parents had to comb it first and pick up as much glass as we could before the game. I told my kids they could never play there again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Feminists care about single-gender non-white schools about as much as they care about the fate of young white women raped, tortured and brutalized by black males.</p>
<p>You can ask Eve Carson, Lauren Burke and Channon Christian&rsquo;s families how much the feminists spoke out or stood up for them in court. </p>
<p>Or, you can ask the falsely accused Duke boys how they were treated by campus feminists who constantly demonstrated, called on the entire lacrosse team to confess, put up wanted posters on campus with pictures of 43 of the 46 white players, called them rapists and demanded they be castrated.</p>
<p>Think they&rsquo;ll ever be held accountable for their accusations (or lack thereof) or made to apologize?  If you do I own a bridge in Brooklyn that I&rsquo;m trying to unload.</p>

		<p>To be fair, this school looks like it&rsquo;s trying really hard to help these kids.  Why should we immediately write them off like it&rsquo;s a thug-overrun PS in NYC?  If we don&rsquo;t want to be a 3rd world country in 40 years we either need to help kids like this get an education, or convince white women to have more babies.  Which do you think is more likely? <br>
And for the record: my husband puts his hands over his ears when I start MY diatribes.  ;)  Not all we members of the fairer sex are brainwashed.</p>

		<p>This article involves education (loosely so) and Detroit.  I want to parlay this into something Paul Kersey has taken to saying in recent weeks.  I apologize in advance if this comes off as condescending.</p>
<p>Last year, Detroit native Chris Hansen devoted an installment of Dateline NBC to one of those &#8220;Whoa is Detroit&#8221; specials.  Toward the end, he profiled his HSAM, a suburban Catholic school, and their &#8220;community service&#8221; project that involved its math students tutoring Detroit Public Schools math students.  My very first thought at the time was that the whites doing the tutoring were giving up a chance to advance their own math education even further to tutor low IQ blacks who have probably grokked all the math they can.  My next thought was that down the road, some invention or innovation that could have been made won&rsquo;t be made, for the whites having to retard their own educational progress.</p>
<p>Last year, on AR, James Edwards and other similar media, we read a story from Oakland (?) where a high school shut down pre- and post-school hours science labs in order to spend the money on black and Hispanic underachievers.  I had the same kind of immediate reaction.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, the St. Louis media ran with a story about the local chapter of BABAA (Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS).  In passing, they told us that the Federal government spent more than $1 million on black men dancing naked in front of teenage AIDS patients at official BABAA functions   &mdash;   What that has to do with preventing the spread of AIDS, I don&rsquo;t know.  I do know that a megabuck spent on naked dancing black men wasn&rsquo;t spent on real AIDS research, or anything else useful.</p>
<p>Those are three tiny examples in three different cities about how spending money on what Kersey terms &#8220;Black Run America&#8221; has meant that real future progress has been sacrificed.  Multiply that by a whole country and several generations, and what do you have?  Kersey thinks he knows:  His recent bon mot is that (paraphrased) the literal trillions we have spent on BRA in the last few generations isn&rsquo;t the whole story, it also comes at the opportunity cost that might run into the quadrillions (1000 trillion) of dollars.  In other words, everything we have collectively given up, not spent money upon, in order to spend money on black welfare, means that we are significantly less prosperous and powerful than we otherwise would have been.  Maybe &#8220;quadrillions&#8221; is hyperbolic language, or maybe it isn&rsquo;t.  But the fundamental point is true.  Imagine if our GDP was double the reality based on the opportunity cost of BRA   &mdash;   It would mean that not only are we not spending exorbitant amounts on black welfare, governments would also be getting more revenue because the private sector economy would be far bigger and far more prosperous.  We would have a trillion dollar surplus, not a trillion dollar deficit.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that public expenditures per se have caused all our problems, it&rsquo;s that the wrong kind of public expenditures at the expense of the right kind of public expenditures are making us worse off.  And it&rsquo;s not that any and every public expenditure will automatically make us better off, it&rsquo;s that the right kind of those will generate dynamic benefits to the economy and society at large.  A dollar spent on the space program eventually means we get better mousetraps and heating blankets and gadgets, that same dollar spent on black welfare and not on the space programs means that we don&rsquo;t get better mousetraps and heating blankets and gadgets.</p>

<p>I thought the same when I saw that picture. None of the locker rooms in the schools I went to ever came close to looking like this one. Of course those schools were 90+% White, I wonder if theres a connection there?<br>
When I read stories like this I always wonder why the CBC, NAACP, BET, Al $harpton, Je$$ie Jack$on, Louis Farrakhan or the countless other wealthy black celebrities/&#8221;rap atisss&#8221; in Hollywood and in the NFL\NBA very seldom help in situations like this! They all claim to care for &#8220;day brothas and sistas&#8221; but instead choose to spend their money buying bling and huge homes in &#8220;racisss&#8221; White neighborhoods far far away from &#8220;the hood&#8221;, &#8220;Rev.&#8221; Wright being a good example. They all talk the talk in public and on t.v. then retreat to their safe White neighborhoods where they then complain about all the &#8220;racisss White folks&#8221; that live around them. Can anyone think of just ONE wealthy black that lives anywhere near the thugs they claim to love? Why the blacks in the hood continue to support these false idols is beyond me, I guess thats where the I.Q. thing takes over.<br>
P.S. I pity that lone White kid, if he\she isn&rsquo;t a w  &mdash;    &mdash;  r by now, their life must be hell! Shame on the parents! No amount of counciling will ever make that kid &#8220;normal&#8221; again!   <br>

		<p>Wow, <i>only</i> three coaches with felony rap sheets? I&rsquo;m shocked! Chicagoan (#6) is likely right about this being an inside job. Given the lack of a black market for football equipment, this is just the sort of heist low-IQ types would pull.</p>
<p>Question Diversity (#9) is also right about the cheating. But don&rsquo;t hold your breath waiting for the investigation.</p>

<p>Well, the University of Tulsa is also the Hurricanes, which makes about as much sense. Maybe the intent here was to honor black poster boy &#8220;Hurricane&#8221; Carter.</p>
