<h1>NRK Takes a Look at British Sharia Courts</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gates of Vienna, October 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Norwegian state television service (NRK) is not known for its hard-hitting investigative reporting on the Islamization of Norway. When dealing with the UK, however, it is willing to take a close look at official British sharia courts, and the disparity between their decisions and the law of the land in Britain.</p>

		<p>You are entering a Sharia controlled zone&hellip;. For some reason that poster brought to mind the final showdown scene in &#8220;The Wild Bunch&#8221; Hardened men armed to the teeth walking into the maelstrom to create a havoc uniquely their own.  Where can I send my Winchester and bandeloros  to make sure the EDL gets it?&hellip;</p>

		<p>Unbelievable. How have these people not been deported? How can the UK political elite allow this to happen? How is this not treason?</p>

		<p>I fear that it&rsquo;s going to take a lot of blood and death before White people wake up.  One &#8220;good&#8221; thing is that Europe will go before we do.  I really believe that many White Europeans will actually come here and lead the way for White people here in the United States.</p>

		<p>I suspect the NRK did this story to raise concerns about radical moslems in Norway. But if they had aired an investigation of moslems in Norway directly there would have been some blowback. So they show radical moslems in the UK instead. People will get the message. I think the NRK&rsquo;s strategy is a good one.</p>

		<p>this should be titled - &#8220;coming to a US city near you.&#8221;</p>
<p>because it is. underground at firs,t then, when they are the majority, you join or are beheaded. this is written in the koran.<br>
this system will work too perfectly for the inept politically correct idiots in the USA. I just hope these liberal morons who have destroyed this once great country are the first in their line.<br>
muslims are breaking the back of every country they infiltrate - they systematically reproduce, get on welfare, and repeat. it&rsquo;s happening in the US today. In my area, there are MANY muslims- all imported over the past 5 years, same in Minneapolis, on and on.</p>

<p>Do the Rabbinical Courts in the UK demand that the members of the Church of England or other religious groups follow Kosher law? The Muslims do not do so; YET. That time is coming. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear from some Brits on whether they think there&rsquo;s any hope for saving indigenous Britons from becoming a minority in their own homeland.  Britain is my ancestral homeland and it breaks my heart to see this stuff.</p>
<p>The thing about Awakened&rsquo;s comment @4 is I keep encountering both Americans and Europeans saying &#8220;things are screwed here, we need to go to the US/Europe and make our stand there.  Many in both places want to run, which is understandable, but doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>The bottom line is I believe that if we lose Europe, we lose everything.  </p>

		<p>Here is the difference between a Jewish court and a Muslim one. That is not to mention that women are regarded as a half person in muslim law or that they&rsquo;re yearning to see stonings and hands amputated for all. It&rsquo;s a sly trick to try to justify muslim courts based on the fact that jewish ones are already operating. No comparison. </p>
<p>&#8220;Contrary to the popular misapprehension, sharia is not like halachah and sharia courts are not like the batei din. Jews believe that the law of the land is the law. Decisions of the batei din are therefore essentially informal rulings; any binding decisions about family or other matters are made in accordance with the law of the land, which is acknowledged to hold sway. By contrast, Muslims promoting sharia believe that Islamic law must supersede the law of the land because sharia is divinely ordained and recognises no superior secular authority.&#8221;<br>
