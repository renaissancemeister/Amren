			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, October 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For several months, radio host Tom Joyner has pleaded with his 8 million listeners to get in line behind the first black president.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick together, black people,&#8221; says Joyner, whose R&B; morning show reaches one in four African American adults.</p>
<p>The Rev. Al Sharpton, an ally of President Obama who has a daily radio show and hosts a nightly cable television program, recently told the president&rsquo;s black critics, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not telling you to shut up. I&rsquo;m telling you: Don&rsquo;t make some of us have to speak up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as Obama and his campaign play down the suggestion that support among African Americans is flagging, a cadre of powerful allies is snapping back at critics in the black community and making explicit appeals for racial loyalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s not even deal with the facts right now. Let&rsquo;s deal with just our blackness and pride  &mdash;  and loyalty,&#8221; Joyner wrote on his BlackAmericaWeb.com blog. &#8220;We have the chance to re-elect the first African-American president, and that&rsquo;s what we ought to be doing. And I&rsquo;m not afraid or ashamed to say that as black people, we should do it because he&rsquo;s a black man.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the focus on sticking together has prompted criticism from some who call it an overly simplistic view that shuts off dialogue about Obama&rsquo;s achievements and his failures.</p>
<p>&#8220;It truncates vibrant conversation in the black community,&#8221; said Eddie Glaude Jr., a professor of religion and African American studies at Princeton University. &#8220;What I hear them saying is, &#8216;Black folk need to get in lock step because we don&rsquo;t want Republicans to take the White House.&rsquo; There is a kind of disciplining of the black polity that doesn&rsquo;t lend itself to a vibrant and detailed consideration about political issues.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There may be more than &#8220;racial loyalty&#8221; in play.  I am reminded of a remark by African-American scholar Shelby Steele:</p>
<p>&#8220;Politically, black America is almost socialistic. There&rsquo;s a feeling that the government is the vehicle that&rsquo;s going to lift us to equality, and without the government, we&rsquo;ll never make it.&#8221;  (Shelby Steele, &#8220;&lsquo;Live&rsquo; with Shelby Steele,&rdquo; The American Enterprise, April, 2006, Preserved at FreeRepublic.com)<br>

<p>It is almost redundant to point out that any White person making similar statements about White political candidates would be attacked from all sides as a Racist Hater White Supremacist Nazi.</p>

		<p>We approve.  We want blacks to be as outspoken as possible about how their blackness seals their bonds of loyalty with N&rsquo;Obamau-mau.  </p>
<p>And then we want them to then channel that progress into demands that we help them get back home to the sunny shores and verdant jungles home sweet home Africa. We have the most splendiferous dreams!</p>
<p>in Nov. 2010, Jared Taylor pointed out that Obama wouldn&rsquo;t have been elected with just the minority vote. Line crossing Whites put him in office, and the majority of voting Whites did not get the candidate of their choice.</p>
<p>The minority and liberal White voting coalition gave us Black Ruled America, a/k/a Black Ruined America.</p>
<p>The more obnoxious the blacks become as we get closer to Nov. 2012, the harder it will be to squeeze agreement out of independent thinking and correct feeling Whites that Diversity is our strength.</p>
<p>We need to do all we can to mainstream the Peter Wood insight into Diversity.  He sounds almost as good at Jared Taylor:</p>

<p>One would have to be very na√Øve to think that the University of Wisconsin will be moved by the two CEO reports to mend its admissions policies; or that it will hold Vice Provost Williams and Dean [of students Lori] Berquam accountable for abusing their authority; or that it will discipline the students involved. There is in Williams&rsquo; subsequent statements a glow of satisfaction that things came off very much as he hoped. And the absence of broader press coverage points to the usual fate of such stories [i.e., the lack of coverage of the story by the major print media]. They are just too awkward to fit with the official narrative of how &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; enriches American higher education. When we think of diversity, we are not supposed to think of gross discrepancies in admissions standards, unfairness to applicants, and &ldquo;mismatches&rdquo; between admittees and institutional standards, let alone flash mobs organized to intimidate critics, or university officials purveying falsehoods to whip students into taking illegal actions. (Peter Wood, &ldquo;Mobbing for Preferences,&rdquo; Chronicle of Higher Education)</p>

<p>On some WNRR websites, we are seeing calls for Obama&rsquo;s reelection, because four more years of such a hate-Whitey black in the White House will push forward WNRR further than we can possible do ourselves, especially if we have Romney or Perry win in 2012.</p>
<p>Wild prediction: Newt gets the nomination, then in desperation embraces the Pat Buchanan panic over the Suicide of a Superpower.  He gets elected in the most divisive and violent election in our nation&rsquo;s history.  Whites finally prevail, but for one last time.  </p>
<p>The illegal anchor babies are now breeding the new American voting population, and they will coalesce with the other minorities to out vote genuine White Humanity into perpetuity, starting 2016. Look for federal intervention a la Little Rock 1957 against Secretaries of State who dare to offend minorities through voter ID laws. We will see the Secretary of the State of South Carolina arrested on the same day of the 2016 election, and the feds will come in and do a recount and round up for the Democrat.  The projected votes of those blacks who were &#8220;discouraged&#8221; from voting will be added to the totals for Dem. Victory.  Ballot box stuffing was done during Reconstruction I, and it will be done again to &#8220;guard the change&#8221; of Reconstruction II.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s over, folks, and you know it.  Our greatest virtues of the future won&rsquo;t be elevated thinking and living, but base survival.  Vengeance will be our moral justice and duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prejudice renders a man&rsquo;s virtue his habit; not a series of unconnected acts.  Through just prejudice, a man&rsquo;s duty becomes a part of his nature.&#8221;  Edmund Burke</p>
<p>Or doesn&rsquo;t Newt get elected. That would help us even more.  From 2012-2016, Obama will get another SCOTUS pick to replace Ginsberg, and he&rsquo;ll put in a black from the Ogletree-Holder gang to counter and neutralize &#8220;Oreo&#8221; Thomas.</p>

		<p>This type of thing is always kicked around as if black people don&rsquo;t always vote for a black candidate. The only thing that blacks do that may hurt Obama might be not turn out to the polls. That&rsquo;s what happened when David Dinkins lost in his reelection bid for mayor of NYC. But the blacks who did show up at the polls voted overwhelmingly for him. It&rsquo;ll be the same with Obama. Whatever blacks show up to vote will vote overwhelmingly for him. </p>

		<p>Of course they&rsquo;ll vote for him.  I&rsquo;m sick of the Republicans saying they&rsquo;re going to &#8220;outreach&#8221; to the black community.  I don&rsquo;t hear that this year though.  Maybe they&rsquo;ve wised up.  And Michael &#8220;hip hop&#8221; Steele out of the way is a good thing too.  As if they would vote for a party that says they want a smaller government and would curtail entitlements.  They say it, but never do it though!  </p>

		<p>When Joyner says GOP he means white. How can blacks get away with this kind of talk? Whites would be lined up and shot dead if they talked like this publicly. </p>
<p>Imus uses the word nappy headed and was fired. Limbaugh wished Obama would fail and cant buy an NFL team. Both are slammed as racists as is the TP.</p>
<p>Weird problem whites have. Unnatural. Its a 24/7/365 deal with the media neocons. Blacks can stick together but whites cant even live as one pure race in the same residential area or its too white.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not even deal with the facts right now. Let&rsquo;s deal with just our white-ness and pride  &mdash;  and loyalty. We have the chance to un-elect the president and that&rsquo;s what we ought to be doing. I am not ashamed to say that as white people that is what we should be doing for the simple fact that the current administration is corrupt. <br>
What I say is that white folks need to get in lockstep because the country can not survive another 4 years of Democrats.<br>
This is just their own word (black vs white) reversed.<br>
I will probably be put on some &#8220;Hate&#8221; list for this, but I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

		<p>As before, BHO will get 98% (or whatever it was) of the black vote.  This isn&rsquo;t a fight over preventing blacks from voting R, but rather it&rsquo;s a fight to get black turnout.  He will need EVEN MORE black turnout in 2012 than he had in 2008, because he&rsquo;s losing a lot of white votes in 2012.  The blacks who vote will all vote for him, but he&rsquo;s worried that fewer will show up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this will be the last dying gasp of the Republican party.  The Democrats are winning just on demographics.  The Republican party has become the party of whites and whites are losing on demographics, due to uncontrolled third world immigration plus trillions of dollars in incentives for idiotic black women to have babies.</p>
<p>It sucks.  I&rsquo;m so happy to have a European citizenship, in addition to my US citizenship.  I hope to retire to a white country somewhere in Europe, whichever one is left.</p>

		<p>The convention where the Republican party began in 1856 vowed to abolish slavery for various reasons.  Primary reason was to instigate a war so northern elites could take over the south&rsquo;s cotton, rice, tobacco, sugar, coal, iron, timber, turpentine and other forest products and numerous world class harbors.</p>
<p>They elected Lincoln, went to war, freed the slaves and until posse comitatus forcibly removed Whites from government jobs and shoved the useless black freedmen in to running government agencies.</p>
<p>1965 to 1974  Presidents Johnson and Nixon are more crafty.  Affirmative action starts out as non discrimination against blacks and within 10 years turns into affirmative action for every variety of non White on the face of the earth with native American Whites excluded from government jobs.</p>
<p>Liberals and blacks turned against their tools, the Republicans, Johnson and Nixon.  Republicans are now vilified as black hating Kluxers and neo nazi racists who want to destroy blacks.</p>
<p>There are plenty of college graduates who think the Republicans fought for the Confederate states in the civil war.  I have met some of them.</p>
<p>What of Johnson and Nixon?  They fulfilled every liberal wish.  Affirmative action, school busing, section 8 massive housing projects filled with blacks, government funds for all sorts of quasi government jobs reserved for the blacks who did get civil service goverment jobs were the accomplishments of Johnson and Nixon.</p>
<p>What did the liberals do to their running dogs Johnson and Nixon?</p>
<p>Hounded both out of office, held massive demonstrations against them and wrote history books featuring them as the epitome of evil.</p>
<p>Nice to see the Republicans get what they deserve for the civil war.  I&rsquo;m a northerner.  The worst thing that ever happened to the US was the freeing of an African population among us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the Republicans can last long.  Even if every White in the country voted republican the Hispanics the republicans are so enthusiastically importing will destroy them.  About half White women are democrats.  </p>
<p>White men are their only voters and the Republicans are actively working with the liberals to exterminate them.</p>
<p>In 50 years there will be one party, the Democrats and a few fringe looney tune radical parties.  The Democrats under George Soros&rsquo; and Bill Ayers successors will move farther and farther left.</p>

<p>#13, I agree about Faroe.  I was just wondering how long it will take before they try to introduce &#8220;diversity&#8221; there.  The Faroese will not easily put up with it.  Unlike most of the other crazy Scandinavians (with the liberal black-worshipping attitudes) they seem to have a very healthy self-image.  I wonder how long these beautiful islands will survive.</p>

		<p>Racial loyalty in itself is important, but if means (as it does with black people), &#8216;racial loyalty even if it means supporting an incompetent leader&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s rather ridiculous. Their inability to see how and why certain leaders are incompetent are exactly why many black people choose incompetent black leaders, whether Obama, Mugabe, and many more. </p>

<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t vote Republican, even for a black Republican.  They will stay home or vote for a white Democrat.  The few black Republicans have been elected by whites.  The Republicans would be wise to cater to their base and not the pizza man.  Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t speak very well.<br>

		<p>Even if Pizza man gets the nod, the blacks will overwhelmingly vote for Obama. Any democrat who can&rsquo;t get 8 out of 10 black votes has some serious problems, or is white, and has a black opponent. At best you might see a 8 to 2 split, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be much more than that. There just aren&rsquo;t that many decent, conservative blacks out there. This isn&rsquo;t to say that they don&rsquo;t exist as I run into a fair percentage of them on the gun range, but those tend to be 1-2 issue type voters, and they also tend to be among the minority of blacks smart enough to make it on their own without affirmative action, and housing subsidies into the suburbs, and they hold suburban values for the most part. </p>
<p>The 10-15% of blacks who can make it in our economy are not the problem, its the other 85-90%. &gt;sigh</p>

		<p>Obama and his advisors are not worried that blacks will vote against him.  They&rsquo;re worried that too many of them will not bother to go the polls.  The excitement of the first black Prez is long over, and it&rsquo;s hard to build fervor over the FIRST REELECTION of the first black Prez.  Add to that the fact that many blacks are disheartened over Obama&rsquo;s failures to do the amazing things some blacks expected or to even maintain a decent economy or control illegal Hispanic immigration.  <br>
#17 Anonymous wonders how the GOP nomination of Cain might change the dynamic.  If such an improbable event did occur, it would sew up Obama&rsquo;s reelection.  Black people don&rsquo;t like black Republicans in general, and certainly if a black Democrat is an alternative, the former would get no more than a few percentage points from blacks  &mdash;  people who already vote Republican in most instances.  What Cain&rsquo;s nomination WOULD do is cause many white people to sit home.  </p>

		<p>A Cain/Obama contest is not easy to contemplate. But against Cain,<br>
Obama might be seen by most Blacks as the pretender and dissembler he is.  The &#8220;delusphere&#8221; that increasingly captivates most Americans has reached a dangerous point of consolidation when a &#8220;stage presence&#8221; like President Obama can be passed off as an exemplar of the American Black experience and as a leader.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t make some of us have to speak up&#8221;  An open admittance that to do mso will expose the black leaders as being racist as we all know.  This should be picked up anhd stressed in the US media as much as possible.<br>
My Amrican friends refer to him s &#8220;Obamanation&#8221;.  But he has not paid off all te arican Americans&rsquo; outstanding mortgages/bonds or rents so he is I guess considered to be a &#8220;sell-out&#8221; by many A.A.-s<br>
God help and God bless America.</p>

		<p>While we&rsquo;re on the suject of Bantus and the election, I&rsquo;d like to ask my fellow Amrenners, WHO is responsible for Herman Cain&rsquo;s poll numbers, lately in the Republican presidential race - </p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t be Bantus, who make up about 2% of the electorate in the Republicans. Nor is it Cuban negritos, concentrated mostly in Florida.</p>
<p>My guess is, it&rsquo;s tea party whites who are trying to &#8220;out-Bantu&#8221; the Democrats, by voting for Cain. I don&rsquo;t think Bantu Democrats are crossing over to vote Republican, all of a sudden.</p>
<p>If, by some miracle, Cain gets the GOP nomination, then this country has had it.  </p>

		<p>Sure they obviously would, but would more vote for Cain, who is even blacker ? That is what the neo-con republicans are hoping for and why I would not be surprised to see the GOP nominate Cain. <br>
However this plan could likely back-fire since it is doubtful that many white GOPpers would vote for Cain and even less would help fund his campaign, all of which leads to a second term for Obaamaa. </p>

<p>If that happens, Obama will win those otherwise reliably red deep South states, because whites will stay home or vote third party.</p>
<p>The reason third parties have never done &ldquo;well&rdquo; (relatively speaking) in the Deep South is because of the racial headcount nature of electoral politics there.  A white Southerner knows that a vote for a third party is effectively a vote for a black Democrat.  However, until Tom Tancredo&rsquo;s Constitution Party campaign for Colorado Governor last year, the best showing that any Constitution Party candidate ever had was for a state legislative race in Mississippi  &mdash;  It was a special election in a heavily black district that a black Democrat would win anyway.  Since it was a special election, the party power structures chose the candidates, and both the Democrats and the Republicans chose black men, and a white candidate running under the CP label was able to get enough sigs to get on the ballot, and get almost all the white votes and finish in second place, albeit a distant second.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how Cain vs Obama will turn out in the Deep South  &mdash;  Third party white candidates finishing in 2nd place, Obama winning the actual states.</p>
<p>But, that&rsquo;s all theoretical.  Cain doesn&rsquo;t have much money, his campaign will fizzle.</p>

		<p>I hear many whites supporting Cain. After the black mob violence and race riots like Wisconsin fair resulting from Obama&rsquo;s presidency, I would caution whites that even though Cain is conservative, blacks will see any black President as a green light to keep attacking whites and keep looting stores and rioting.</p>

<p>Lyndon Johnson was a Democrat. His &#8220;Great Society&#8221; and &#8220;War on Poverty&#8221; programs are part of the reason we&rsquo;re in trouble now.</p>
