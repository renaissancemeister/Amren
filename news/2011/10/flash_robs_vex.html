			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann Zimmerman and Miguel Bustillo, Wall Street Journal, October 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Retailers this holiday season are preparing to protect themselves against a new group of unwanted visitors: swarms of teenagers and young adults who plot via Twitter, phone texts and Facebook to descend on stores and steal merchandise.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials call them &#8220;flash robs,&#8221; a criminal incarnation of the &#8220;flash mob&#8221; phenomenon in which participants use social media to organize impromptu gatherings, from dances in shopping malls to uprisings in the Middle East.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The National Retail Federation says that flash-mob attacks were reported by 10% of the 106 retailers it surveyed in July, a group that included department stores and big-box chains, as well as grocery and drug-store operators. Security personnel or police nabbed suspects in about half the cases, according to the survey, which examined crimes involving more than one perpetrator. Several incidents resulted in injuries, the survey found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Retail merchandise theft rose almost 8% last year to $27 billion, according to the preliminary results of a security study conducted by the University of Florida for the NRF. {snip}<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that 10% of retailers across the nation have reported being the victims of black flash mobs. It&rsquo;s also no surprise that our national news media has hidden these attacks from us and ignore any black on white crimes while they sensationalize the smallest infraction by a white person. </p>
<p>This seems to be the case in Canada, Europe, and Australia. I believe there is some guiding hand that does this across the planet.</p>

		<p>In Gary, a recent news story was about how a local, long-standing plumbing supply house (white-operated, of course) was plundered and then set fire to. And blacks wonder why their areas have trouble attracting and holding business. A thousand years from now, liberals will still refuse to admit that blacks have a greater genetic propensity towards criminality than other races.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Flash mobs&#8221; are nothing new. About 30 years ago, I worked in an office that was near a very nice little neighborhood IGA store. It was in a nice safe area, but there was a middle school that had numerous minority &#8220;utes&#8221; from the projects. On more than one occasion after school, a dozen or so would enter the store simultaneously and fan out down all the aisles stuffing their pockets with whatever they could grab and then run for the front door and fire exits.</p>
<p>After these incidents, the store owner would sit by the front door and lock it as the little thieves approached. He would then let them in two at a time and each would be escorted around the store. Those remaining outside would spit on the door and mumble about the GD white m&hellip;r that owned the place. </p>
<p>This was really sad and also infuriating. The store had been there since the 1930s and many of its customers were elderly blacks. The owner treated them very kindly and often would personally drive them home, especially if they were using canes or walkers.</p>

		<p>Remember that blacks believe that whites are rich.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what car a white person drives or what clothing a white person wears.  They have money because they are white.  A black person is entitled to steal from a white person because they are rich.  They have more than they need, so they can give some up to the people they have &#8220;wronged&#8221;.  So&hellip;..white business owners should come into black areas and remain there, even if they are robbed by the black inhabitants of the neighborhood.  If they don&rsquo;t, they are just racist haters.  </p>

		<p>Perhaps the owner could try suspending a cage of rattlesnakes near the cash register.  When confronted with a flash mob, he could release the cage to the floor, whereupon the highly agitated snakes could swarm out.</p>
<p>Seriously, some years back I recall reading of a Texas retailer who was frequently burglarized after closing.  His solution was to release a number of diamondbacks after closing, policing them up before opening the following morning.  The plan went awry only once, when one day he couldn&rsquo;t find one of the snakes and had to delay opening until the reptile could be located and put back in the cage.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I went to a Store to pick up an item. I waited for a spot to open up. It was a black woman in the space, and she backed out of the parking spot, in her Mercedes Benz sedan.</p>
<p>Note that I am not driving an expensive German car. But I am the rich one. </p>

<p>H/T to the Anonymous poster who posted this URL a few days ago.</p>
<p>These flash robs seem to have two things in common:  One, the usual suspects, and two, the usual victims, almost always white and politically and/or socially left wing.  Notice this Minneapolis victim was some pub whose electric power comes from people riding bikes, so this is probably a green/left wing hangout.  MN is a CCW state, but it probably lets businesses opt out, side bet is that this &#8220;Pedal Pub&#8221; has the &#8220;No Guns&#8221; sign hanging on the entrance, a sign which practically begs flash robs and other violent crime.</p>

		<p>I remember about three months ago,  I was reading some amren articles. It was about black on white rape, flash mobs, and various other crimes. The articles were either amren articles or links to small local newspapers. The local media usually omitted the race of the perpetrator. Furthermore, these extreme interracial  crimes were never given any national coverage. CNN was on in the background. CNN was reporitng that in Quebec, a black African athlete was ridiculed by white students. I think the students were wrong for doing this, but a simple white on black INSULT made INTERNATIONAL news. At nearly the same time, a young teenage white girl was gang raped by two black students. The black students went to juvenile hall for about a year and were then allowed back in school. The victim was tortured by her black classmates as a snitch, endured daily insults and threats. This story somehow escaped international news.  At that time, before and after, thousands of black on white crimes escaped even local news as well. This omission is infuriating and it is the last straw. I have lost friends over this issue. Many wish to bury their heads in the sand, but I will not back down. I hope some of you out there will join me in lashing back at the media. (in a legal way of course).  We need lash back at CNN and the rest of the racist media. We need to make them remember interracial crime, and harrass them until their hands shake. </p>

		<p>@#10 Question Diversity:  My boyfriend and his friend own a bar, and we always check IDs.</p>
<p>In this area, the only bars that have problems with violence, ever, are the black-oriented ones.  At one in particular, there are arrests nearly every weekend and there have been four shootings in the last seven years, including two fatal ones in the last year.  The locals are picketing it and trying to get it closed down.  Of course, the owners and some patrons are defending it by saying those who wish it closed are &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve never thought of making the required IDs to be driver&rsquo;s licenses or passports, but perhaps that&rsquo;s a good idea.  I wonder why so few blacks and Latinos, compared to whites, have valid driver&rsquo;s licenses.  </p>
<p>The bar down the street from us that I mentioned in the above paragraph has now installed metal detectors.  Perhaps they should have been performing pat-downs long before this.  I just don&rsquo;t understand why someone would shoot someone else, much less inside a bar where everyone is supposed to be just drinking and dancing and having a good time.  Sad.</p>

<p><i>I wonder why so few blacks and Latinos, compared to whites, have valid driver&rsquo;s licenses.</i></p>
<p>No solid idea.  Maybe they just can&rsquo;t pass the driving test, maybe a lot of them have suspended licenses.  Don&rsquo;t forget, these disparities are from Wisconsin, and maybe Wisconsin is stricter on its driving test and the conditions by which one&rsquo;s license can be suspended than other states.  In St. Louis, the blacks mostly go to the Department of Revenue office in North St. Louis City (ghetto), where they know the DoR clerks will score their tests as passed even if they fail, and the black highway patrol officers will mark them down as having passed the driving test even if they really didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>In a story I caught in my local Marxist rag today (online), I&rsquo;m quite certain this bar owner wishes he&rsquo;d subscribed to such a practice, and if he had, this young, white male might still be alive (and thanks to all you baby&rsquo;s mamas&rsquo;  for assigning your children conspicuous names that clues us in to what the controlled media tries so desperately to hide).  Note too how as usual the disinfo media characterizes three-to-four-on-one as a &#8220;fight&#8221; somehow implying equal footing&hellip; Additionally, a story dated Oct. 1 actually states that it was 6-7- (note the curious language there too) on-one while the first link suggest fewer and has no date so you can&rsquo;t even identify the sequence of the stories much less the numbers involved in what is clearly a mob killing:</p>
