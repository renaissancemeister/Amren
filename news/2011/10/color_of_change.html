			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rebecca Shapiro, Huffington Post, October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African American political advocacy group Color Of Change has called for MSNBC to fire longtime analyst (and even longer-time lightning rod) Pat Buchanan for what it called his &#8220;white supremacist ideology.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advocacy group sent petition letters to its members on Tuesday. {snip}</p>
<p>While Color of Change cited comments made by Buchanan from as early as March 2008, the advocacy group highlighted Buchanan&rsquo;s new book &#8220;Suicide Of A Superpower&#8221; and a Saturday appearance on the controversial radio show &#8220;The Political Cesspool&#8221; (whose host has described his ideology as &#8220;pro-white&#8221;) as current reasons the network should fire Buchanan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buchanan has just published a book which says that increasing racial diversity is a threat to this country and will mean the &#8216;End of White America.&rsquo; This weekend, to promote his book, he went on a white supremacist radio show &hellip; &#8221; read the &#8220;Fire Pat Buchanan&#8221; petition letter.</p>
<p>Buchanan also appeared on NPR&rsquo;s &#8220;The Diane Rehm Show&#8221; on Tuesday and further discussed his new book and radio show appearance on &#8220;Political Cesspool.&#8221;</p>
<p>He defended his decision to visit the radio show and asked &#8220;Am I supposed to go and vet all the people on these shows and get the list from [Anti-Defamation League chief] Abe Foxman on what shows I can go on to?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Buchanan also told Rehm that &#8220;the argument that diversity is a strength is a canard. It is nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buchanan&rsquo;s new book takes on the racial makeup of the U.S. and has a chapter entitled &#8220;The End of White America.&#8221; {snip}</p>

		<p>This shows you just how ferocious opponents of race realism really are, even when arguments on its behalf operate even at half-strength.  Advice to MSNBC:  Don&rsquo;t yield an inch.  Then again, as MSNBC just brought Rev. Al Sharpton aboard full-time, the (Comcast-owned) network most likely will capitulate.</p>

		<p>Did you all notice that when the left describes a person who has White people&rsquo;s interests in mind, they are quoted as &#8220;pro White&#8221; like it&rsquo;s a negative thing. But Al Not-So-Sharpton is often described as a &#8220;champion of civil rights within the black community&#8221;, like he&rsquo;s son hero. Yeah right. A hero for himself, but he&rsquo;s got an overwhelming number of blacks believing he&rsquo;s looking out for their best interests. What a joke. </p>
<p>Sadly, Lush Limbaugh has too many Whites thinking he is a champion for their cause. That is an even bigger joke. He is a side show for the corporate right wing extremists. Not a friend of us Middle class AmReners. Buchanan is not continuously on the air, brought to you by Faux News, and lining his pockets with falsehoods at the expense of viewers/ listeners. Buchanan is right on the money when he facetiously asks if he should ask permission to see the royal ADL and kiss the czar&rsquo;s ring before he goes on a rogue network. That&rsquo;s exactly what they want you to do Pat. </p>

		<p>Doubt it will happen.  MSNBC likes PJB for two reasons:  One, he&rsquo;s their token rightist to combat bias charges, and two, he often criticizes other Republicans, which is music to the ears of most MSNBC personalities.</p>
<p>Happy to read that PJB doesn&rsquo;t check with the ADL before he goes on radio shows.  That&rsquo;s a change for him - In 1995 or so, he asked Carto not to run his column in <i>The Spotlight</i> precisely because of ADL pressure.</p>

		<p>If Patrick J. Buchanan ran for president in 2012, I would be the happiest new voter in America.  I have read two of his books, listened to a lot of what he has to say, and honestly I think he would be perfect for our country right now.  I suppose I&rsquo;ll just wind up voting for Ron Paul in the primary (if I&rsquo;m old enough during the primary vote), and then for whoever the Republican candidate is, unless it turns out to be Rick Perry.  Perry is such a despicable liar politician that I would rather not vote at all then give another vote to him.</p>

		<p>This perfectly illustrates the futility of Buchanan&rsquo;s non-racial position.  While he has very carefully danced around the entire issue of race, avoiding the slightest mention of the subject, if he is perceived as pro-white he is going to get accused of &#8220;racism&#8221; anyway. He can&rsquo;t win. </p>
<p>When is he going to wake up and speak out?</p>

		<p>The notion that diversity is a strength is, as Buchanan says, nonsense.</p>
<p>Diversity can certainly make a society more colorful and interesting, and within limits, even more desirable in certain ways.  There&rsquo;s no question that our original completely Anglo-Saxon colonies, and later nation, were enriched and enhanced by the many Scandinavian, southern European, and Eastern European immigrants.  Northeast Asians have also contributed positively to our great nation.</p>
<p>Presently, however, there is little or no evidence that black Africans or Mexicans, to cite just a couple of examples, have been, on balance, a positive enhancement to our culture and civilization. The evidence to date would appear to be quite to the contrary. Not every racial and ethnic group in our world is tempermentally or intellectually suited for positive contribution to a modern technologically oriented civilization.  Sorry, that&rsquo;s just the way it is.</p>

		<p>I believe that many &#8220;Liberal&#8221; people aren&rsquo;t quite as deluded as they portray themselves.  I believe that there is a significant number of them that have started to see the overt anti-white push that has been happening in every Western country.  Whatever is done, it&rsquo;s never enough to satisfy &#8220;minorities.&#8221;  It will never be enough.  Deep down they know, as Buchanan, that without white people, there will be no civilization.   </p>

		<p>Someone is going to need to take it to the next level because PJB is stuck and is afraid to drive forward. He is spinning his wheels at this point.</p>
<p>That next person has to openly advocate for whites - but good luck finding a cable channel with the stones to put that person 0n the air (wires/satellite).</p>
<p>It seems that person(s) is out there, somewhere, so we may simply have to wait a touch longer for the medium to change. Fox News and MSBNC, et al, will one day become old news, just as CBS and ABC and NBC are now.</p>
<p>The key is to find and grab that new medium before the multicults totally control it. </p>
<p>I sense the problem is not with the message because I know most whites, finally, are forming a connection with AmRen beliefs. So it is not the message but (at least in part) the delivery system.</p>

		<p>A single voice peeps up and expresses a white identity. Look how fast they rush to stamp it out. It&rsquo;s not like there are thousands of white voices to be heard every day. White voices are very rare, and there are many out there who want to keep it that way. Keeping a lid on whites may be getting harder. There are many white organizations out there. Give them money and you get more white voices. If you agree with Buchanan and want to help him, then help bring in many more like-minded people and leaders. Don&rsquo;t leave Pat standing my himself. </p>

		<p>    Pat Buchanan has said that &#8220;Suicide of a Superpower&#8221; is his last book on this subject and I believe he doesn&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s fired from MSNBC. He mentioned on the Hannity show, included on Amren that he expected to be savaged by the MSM. <br>
 <br>
   Speaking of Hannity, he couldn&rsquo;t seem to grasp that a white minority United States wouldn&rsquo;t be the same United States we&rsquo;ve had since the founding of the Republic. Sorry Mr. Hannity a United States with a majority of non-European Third World descended people will be a United States in name only. It really is quite simple: the people make the country. If the all the racial Japanese were magically moved to Haiti, then Haiti would become a new Japan. Likewise, if all the Haitians replaced the Japanese, who magically moved to Haiti, then Old Japan would become the new Haiti. <br>

		<p>I think that as the foundation of illuminated white people continues to grow, we&rsquo;ll begin to see leaders who are willing to promote and defend our cause more publicly.  Right now, it&rsquo;s simply media suicide to speak the truth, and preaching to the choir doesn&rsquo;t get you any exposure.  As the enlightened and indignant audience expands (and I&rsquo;m seeing it happen right before my eyes), public figures will be able to put some courage behind their convictions without fear of media exile.</p>

<p>I ask that American Renaissance not encourage this type of thinking - it&rsquo;s been 100% failure for us. Our people don&rsquo;t organize, don&rsquo;t form competitive, winning local political organizations and instead they waste their time and money on no hope, 3rd part President campaigns of nice, sincere OLD MEN who&rsquo;ve basically dropped out or have been driven out of mainstream politics/society.</p>
<p>Buchanan did very well until he got talked in to their ridiculous 3rd party, Reform Presidential campaign where he didn&rsquo;t even win 2%. </p>
<p>Pat Buchanan should have run and WON the governorship of New Hampshire. Tom Tancredo should have won and WON the governorship of Colorado. Way too many of our people fall for the lie that the US Presidential campaign is the be all and end all and that it&rsquo;s a great place to &#8220;TEACH&#8221; America THE TRUTH. It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t refer to the commenters as liberals as much as I would refer to them as programmed people who activate no critical thought within themselves.  Sadly, those commenters, no matter what color, do not offer independent thought but parrot the information that has been fed to them for the past fifty years.  Reality and reason are no longer part of the equation.</p>
<p>Liberalism really isn&rsquo;t the enemy, facist/marxist thought is.  And those thoughts are being fed to all of us.<br>

		<p>The idea that PJB should start an internet broadcast similar to what Glenn Beck has done is a great idea. </p>
<p>He is apparently wealthy enough now, and has the name recognition to make a go of it.</p>
<p>I think that Pat has MUCH more in common with Amreners than some of us might realize. I have followed his writing for many years and have read every book he has written. He is, if not at one with us, very close. </p>
<p>I think he has &#8220;danced around&#8221; some of the core beliefs simply to keep his public voice as with MSNBC, but now he may be ready to speak out. </p>
<p>I hope so. The timing for these sorts of moves is important to the success or failure of the effort. </p>
<p>Four years of BHO, coupled with the egregious steps taken by Holder&rsquo;s DOJ, plus the so-called flash mobs, may have provided some fertile ground for someone like Pat to launch a movement.</p>
<p>If Pat decides to make such a move, and does it in the right way, I think he could bring many, many Whites to the Cause! Go Pat go!!</p>

<p>Remember, Tancredo did run for Colorado Governor last year.  See how well that turned out?  Colorado might be gone forever.  FNC reports that there are now a million Hispanics in Colorado. </p>
<p>Also, PJB lives in Virginia, so I doubt he would meet the residency requirements to be the Governor of New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Your fundamental point is correct, though.  With rare exception, every President since Lincoln has had at least of of these five things on his resume:  State Governor, U.S. Senate, Four- or Five-Star (or equivalent) military general, Presidential Cabinet Secretary, or Vice-President.  </p>

<p>MSNBC has almost no ratings already.  But what little they have would go down to pretty much zero if they cut PJB loose.  I only watch the Morning Shmoo every once in awhile, only to see and hear PJB&rsquo;s take on whatever they think is news.  That&rsquo;s my only use for MSNBC.</p>
<p>30 Noneknown:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I ever made the accusation that PJB doesn&rsquo;t have much in common with us.  He obviously does.  My grind is that PJB in action (and by &#8220;in action,&#8221; I mean in Presidential campaigns) hasn&rsquo;t translated those words into actual behavior.  I was always taught that words were cheap, and actions were what really mattered.</p>

		<p>I think part of the problem is white liberals are worried Buchanan may be right rather than being convinced he is wrong.</p>
<p>So what do you do when you can&rsquo;t think of a rebuttal?</p>
<p>You try and silence your opponent.</p>

		<p>It seems the multiculturalists depend on emotion, rather than reason, to make their case. The create the myth of racism and make it moral dilemma to &#8216;sin&rsquo; against diversity. </p>
<p>Rational, logical thinking is trumped by White guilt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen an &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; Hollywood production that applied reason. Rather, they always make an emotional appeal. </p>
<p>It works. </p>

		<p>QUESTION:  Is there a counter-petition or other organized attempt to defend Buchanan?  If there&rsquo;s not, there should be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to fire off an email to MSNBC defending Buchanan.  I hope we can all do more.</p>

<p>Remember, Tancredo did run for Colorado Governor last year. See how well that turned out? Colorado might be gone forever. FNC reports that there are now a million Hispanics in Colorado.</p>
<p>Also, PJB lives in Virginia, so I doubt he would meet the residency requirements to be the Governor of New Hampshire.</p>
<p><br>
Jack responds:</p>
<p>Tancredo lost his race for governor of Colorado (he strongly beat the Republican candidate) because he ran under the &#8220;Constitution Party&#8221; instead of the Republican party. If he had run as a Republican he would have won - these 3rd parties of CONSTITUTIONALISTS and LIBERTARIAN REFORM Party campaigns never win, the only exception was Jessie Ventura in Minnesota - it never works with conservative, working class White Red States.</p>
<p>Buchanan won the New Hampshire Presidential primary in 1996 and had strong state ORGANIZATION including the support of the Manchester Union Ledger and Buchanan had strong White union support - not just the 1% libertarian intellectuals. If Buchanan had decided to GO LOCAL he could have moved to New Hampshire, acquired state residency, then ran and WON the New Hampshire governorship and then built US a strong state NH party, with new young talent. Instead, PJB&rsquo;s enablers encouraged him to stay on the national Presidential stage,  run again for President of the United States on the obscure Reform 3rd Party and PJB won less than 2%.</p>
<p>The US Presidential campaign is not a good place for us to put our time, money, hopes and dreams - it is mostly fixed against us  - the best that can be achieved is that we force some discussion/consideration of immigration.</p>
<p>We can and are winning state houses, congressional race and Governorships which have real power. I&rsquo;m looking to win REAL power not just moan and complain, hang around Libertarian true believers who believe that organizing and WINNING anything are signs of EVIL COLLECTIVISM.</p>

		<p>John @ 28. It&rsquo;s good to acknowledge the contributions of all Euro-Americans &amp; Americans who are of Far East Asian ethnicity. However, let&rsquo;s not forget those of us from the Near East, Central Asia &amp; the sub-continent. This includes Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Asian Indians, Iranians, Lebanese Christians, Turks &amp; several other groups. Although small in numbers, these aforementioned ethnicities are some of this nation&rsquo;s best educated, affluent &amp; most loyal citizens. Many did not have the benefit of preferential treatment, affirmative action &amp; welfare as did the indigenous black/Hispanic population of today. Yet, their contibutions to this country far exceed both of them by a long shot. Look at the academic achievements of Indian students or the number of Iranian Ph.Ds in science &amp; engineering on the faculties of the best universities. Many cities now have more physicians from the Middle East than they have black and or Latino. I would say these groups are far more productive &amp; preferred than a race that makes up over 70% of our current prison population!</p>

<p>Yes, Tancredo was running on the CP label.  But the Republican was such a turkey that Tancredo was the de facto Republican nominee.  The Democrat won anyway, with more than 50% of the vote.  Even if Tancredo would have won the official Republican Party nomination, he wouldn&rsquo;t have won in November.  Colorado is almost lost to the third world.</p>
<p>One other reason why the Presidency isn&rsquo;t a good investment for us for now is because Presidential campaigns are expensive, and this invites the big money interests.  Congressional races are much cheaper, more leverage for the buck.</p>

		<p>What if PB was telling everyone that 2+2 =5?All the talk shows would be fighting to have him on so they could prove him wrong.They would have 4 sticks laid out and slowly add them up and hope to God he kept saying it was 5 so they could laugh at him more.Or say that he claimed dogs were really reptiles and not mammals.They would not try to interfere with his free speech;they would encourage the vigirous exchange of ideas in the public format; for the people to sort out the truth.</p>
<p>BUT!!!! What if the facts were on his side and every study showed him right?The very fact that they try to get him fired and out of the public debate shows he is right. THEY KNOW HE IS RIGHT BUT IT GOES AGAINST THEIR RELIGION.</p>

		<p>Buy Pat&rsquo;s book, and hand them out as Christmas gifts this year. </p>
<p>First, you put some money into the pocket of a well deserving White Scholar, and Conservative, who defends our values.</p>
<p>Second, you hand out the book, to wake people up to our current situation. </p>
