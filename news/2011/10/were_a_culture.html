			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Damien Gayle, Daily Mail (London), October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Halloween is a time for parties, dressing up and having fun with a bit of harmless  &mdash;  but scary  &mdash;  make-believe. </p>
<p>But a group of college students are taking a stand against some costumes which, they say, can cause hurt and humiliation to people from minority ethnic groups. </p>
<p>Students Teaching Against Racism in Society, an Ohio University student group, have created a poster campaign to highlight the racial stereotyping all too common in Halloween party dress.</p>
<p>The campaign, headlined &#8216;We&rsquo;re a culture, not a costume&rsquo;, shows images of people of different ethnic groups holding up images partygoers whose costumes they say lampoon their cultures.</p>
<p>Above each image, the posters read: &#8216;This is not who I am, and this is not okay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They have provoked an online row over whether the costumes are actually racist, or whether they are just in good fun.</p>
<p>One blogger who wrote about the posters two days ago had to disable comments on her website after she got 3,000 views and comments from &#8216;rude, racist people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind blog, Melissa Sipin wrote of the campaign: &#8216;These posters act as a public service announcement for colored [sic] communities.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s about respect, human dignity, and the acceptance of other cultures (these posters simply ask people to think before they choose their Halloween costume).&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added: &#8216;What these costumes have in common is that they make caricatures out of cultures, and that is simply not okay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One poster shows a young Arab-American man holding up an image of a Halloween reveller wearing Arabic dress and a suicide bombers vest.</p>
<p>Another shows a Native American man holding a picture of two women with paint on their faces and feathers in their hair holding a sign reading, &#8216;Me wantum piece [sic] &hellip;  not war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A third poster shows an Asian American woman holding up a picture of a woman dressed as a Japanese geisha girl, with silk kimono and heavy white foundation.</p>
<p>On the Huffington Post, where the story has also been reported, website comments were split over whether the costumes could be judged offensive.</p>
<p>Many could see nothing wrong with dressing according to racial stereotypes: A user going by the screen name Masterkcb1 wrote on the site: &#8216;People need to get a sense of humour, and quit taking everything so seriously.</p>
<p>&#8216;If I can&rsquo;t dress like a bandito then nobody can dress like a ghost because I don&rsquo;t have a tan and I find it offensive.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>I cannot believe this. <br>
What a crybaby culture American minorities have turned into.<br>
Odd how the Asian/Hispanic/Africans are so hypersensitive, but whites have to absorb every insult and joke imaginable and smile.</p>

		<p>Yet I&rsquo;m sure if one wanted to dress up in overalls complete with straw hat, a few missing teeth and a goofy expression painted on their face, trying to portray a &#8220;hillbilly&#8221;, not one of these people would have an issue with it. After all, it&rsquo;s all in good fun&hellip; right?</p>

		<p>I see persons of four different races - Asian, black, &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; and Arab - wearing Western style clothing invented by whites.</p>
<p>Offhand, I would say that the posters they&rsquo;re holding DO depict who they really are.</p>
<p>When they dress up like whites, speak a white language, and live in a white country, they&rsquo;re not being true to their origins.  </p>

		<p>Where to begin?  There is so much that I, too, find offensive here&hellip;about the poster itself.</p>
<p>First, there&rsquo;s the nonsensical slogan.  It would have made more sense, had the slogan been &#8216;We&rsquo;re a RACE, not a costume&rsquo;.  But of course, we can&rsquo;t acknowledge the existence of Races, anymore.  So, we have to say &#8216;culture&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So, if race is nonexistent, and all that distinguishes Japanese from Swedes is &#8216;culture&rsquo;, then how the heck would this young Asian female (whose facial features don&rsquo;t look very Japanese to me) be mistaken for a Geisha?  What does that picture have to do with the woman holding it?  Nothing at all, of course. I assume that&rsquo;s a Geisha in the picture.  Or is it someone &#8216;decorated for Kabuki&rsquo;?  And if this young woman is not Japanese, then how is the Geisha a reflection of her &#8216;culture&rsquo;?  Geishas, I&rsquo;m told, were originally Men.  So, is this woman&rsquo;s saying &#8220;this is not OK&#8221; an attack on Japanese Cross-dressers?  That attack seems rather &#8216;homophobic&rsquo; to me.  In any event, Geishas were held in high esteem. And Kabuki performers are practically worshiped.  So what gives this rather Mongolian-looking young woman the right to say that Geishas (or Kabuki Artists) are &#8216;not OK&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Next, we have the young woman in the black Tee, who is offended, apparently, by the fact that a woman in a sleeveless black Top is portraying a member of the &#8216;Hip Hop Culture&rsquo;.  How is that a reflection on the woman with sleeves on her black Top?  If there were such a thing as race&hellip;  But since there isn&rsquo;t, we are led to believe that Women&rsquo;s Black Tops constitute a &#8216;culture&rsquo;, and that as such, they are sacrosanct.  Black Tops may not be parodied.  They are not OK as material for satire.</p>
<p>&#8216;Et puis&rsquo;&hellip;we have a young man with artfully-shaped eyebrows, holding a picture of a quite studly-looking Mexican astride a Donkey.  Even if there WERE races, &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; is not a real race, so I don&rsquo;t know where to begin here&hellip; Is this lovely young male person saying that his own (I&rsquo;m guessing here) &#8216;Metrosexual Culture&rsquo; is negatively portrayed by an image of an XY Chromosome individual who actually looks like a MAN?  Is that the point here?  Or is the Mexican&rsquo;s sexy grin, coupled with the Donkey, suggestive of large unmentionable parts?  Is that what&rsquo;s wrong?  Biometric data suggests that, in aggregate, that stereotype of Mexicans is untrue.  However, I would consider that to be a POSITIVE stereotype, if ever there was one.  But is the &#8216;not OK&rsquo; part of this the unreasonable standards of studliness that many in the Metrosexual Community are unable to measure up to?  Are manly-looking XY Chromosome individuals now an affront to femmy-looking ones?</p>
<p>Finally, we have what I take to be a Syrian Jew (I assume that&rsquo;s a Yarmulke on his head), in traditional Western garb, on the verge of tears, holding a photo of a very pink-skinned man, pretending to be a Muslim.  The Muslim appears to be involved in an activity held in great esteem within that &#8216;culture&rsquo;.  Even if there were such a thing as &#8216;Race&rsquo;, the young man holding the photo does not look like an Arab to me: nor does the man (probably of the &#8216;Celtic&rsquo; &#8216;culture&rsquo;) in the costume.  Please help me!  I&rsquo;m confused!  I see no relationship between the photo and the person holding it.  It&rsquo;s as if I were holding a picture of someone dressed as the Easter Bunny, and saying that it was not OK, because it was stereotyping ME.  If I ever do such a thing, please have me committed.<br>

		<p>Wow.  You know, I actually considered going as a slave for Halloween one year, and my brother as a planter.  I thought about putting on black-face, chains, and raggedy clothing, and he would wear a fancy Antebellum suit with top-hat and monocle.  But, we decided not to, for reasons this article makes obvious: there are many in our society who can&rsquo;t accept racial humor.<br>

		<p>I saw this article on Yahoo Shine yesterday and started cracking up.  In my Native American classes at the U of Utah, we are taught that historical images of Indians in America are racist, too&hellip;  Campaigns like this only emphasize how intolerant minorities are of expression.  Why isn&rsquo;t an image of a German person in lederhosen included in this campaign?  We all know why.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 14&rsquo;s link has the right idea.  The parody is funny, makes the multicult ad campaign look silly and accomplishes this in a single, simple image.  Making fun of them for their hyper-sensitive posters makes them look like total downers, not the type of people you&rsquo;d want at your Halloween party anyways.</p>

		<p><i> The campaign, headlined &lsquo;We&rsquo;re a culture, not a costume&rsquo;, shows images of people of different ethnic groups holding up images partygoers whose costumes they say lampoon their cultures. </i> </p>
<p>Is the right to lampoon not protected by the American constitution? Think back to the great political cartoonists of the past, such as Thomas Nast, who lampooned &#8220;Boss&#8221; Tweed and the other political figures of his day. Think back all the way to colonial times when papers ran political cartoons lampooning the excesses of their culture. So lampooning something is not allowed anymore?</p>
<p>I think we should call this type of costume a form of &#8220;political free speech.&#8221; If we&rsquo;re upset by Mexicans threatening to reduce whites to a demographic minority, why not wear a costume lampooning their &#8220;culture?&#8221; it&rsquo;s a form of free speech. If we&rsquo;re upset about the disparity of criminal behavior among the races, why can&rsquo;t we dress up as black ghetto thugs as a form of &#8220;protest?&#8221; If we&rsquo;re upset about Islamic terrorism, why can&rsquo;t we dress up as suicide bombers.?</p>
<p>If these poor &#8220;offended children are so upset, then they should direct their anger at their compatriots who give the rest of their race a bad name, not at those who simply point it out. It&rsquo;s really about the abrogation of our right to free speech.</p>

		<p>Halloween is a celebration held over from the Pagan Celtic festival celebrating the Celtic New Year. It is totally European in origin and context. Now for these people of non-European &#8220;culture&#8221; to horn in and claim they are somehow offended by WE celebrate OUR festival is presumptuous in the extreme. They have no right to even celebrate Halloween anyway, and if they are &#8220;offended&#8221; so effing what. Get over it! </p>

People are too thin-skinned  and it seems to me that they are just looking for something else to whine about and call &#8220;Raccccccisssssst&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re trying, but you ought to study up on it a bit more. You betray illiteracy in the subject while attempting to write about it in a sophisticated manner.  The result is a bit embarrassing to those who know.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;Hallows&#8221; was never a Celtic holiday, it was the Catholic version of the Celtic New Years Eve celebration as they sought to absorb the Old Religion.  The real event was based on the season and the end of the year that was around October 31, and called &#8220;Samhaine.&#8221;  It was a festival like a harvest festival when crops had been gathered and beasts slaughtered for the winter&rsquo;s store.  It was believed that at that time, when crops were experiencing their &#8220;death&#8221; as well as the selected livestock for man&rsquo;s benefit, the &#8220;veil&#8221; between our world and the Otherworld was thin, and the ancestors, those long dead, leaders and heads of the clan or tribe or groups were close and could be relied upon to reveal their old wisdom and guidance.  There were &#8220;priests&#8221; of a sort called Samethoi who at the time of the first frosts left for the land of mists with the souls of the recent dead to conduct them to the place of rest and bring back knowledge and enlightenment.  We can understand this today as a European version of the Amerind &#8220;vision quest&#8221; in a way.  Bonfires were a big part of the festival.  People would bring objects that represented bad experiences or feelings they had felt during the year and throw them into the fire, then many would jump over the fire to show their fearlessness of the dangers of life.  This festival still is observed in England on November 5th as Guy Fawkes, or Bonfire Night.  To get away with holding onto customs under the nose of Puritans the church alike, the English folk moved the day a little, and renamed it after Guy Fawkes, who blew up the parliament in 1605.  Protestants tried to kill it off, but the Catholics tried to change the name and meaning as they had already done with Christmas and Easter.  Oh, marriage existed as well. It was called &#8220;handfasting,&#8221; and was done in a sacred oak grove in spring.  The great Gothic cathedrals mimic those sacred oak groves in their high, pointed arches. This is well known.  To further destroy the meaning of it, stories of horror were associated with the day as in Washington Irving&rsquo;s, &#8220;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&#8221; which was based on a much older German tale.  From there, a 19th century explosion in superstitious replays of old European culture appeared in macabre stories about Count Vlad the Impaler (who actually kicked Ottoman a$$), and other now well known stories that have their modern culture in horror films that are associated with the date.</p>
<p>But there are those of us who read and frequent the Amren posting boards who love their white, European ancestry, and understand ALL of its traditions and racial memories.  It is who we are, having been so for thousands of years before.  We still remember and some of us at least will until the last white dies.  I predict that the last white will be filled with this knowledge because we are the most genuine of all white Europeans.</p>

I&rsquo;m sure this would drive the Asian woman pictured above over the edge if she were to visit around this time of year.

		<p>When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with whom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is pronounced among minority rights advocates, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights they defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities. The terms &#8220;negro,&#8221; &#8220;oriental,&#8221; &#8220;handicapped&#8221; or &#8220;chick&#8221; for an African, an Asian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. &#8220;Broad&#8221; and &#8220;chick&#8221; were merely the feminine equivalents of &#8220;guy,&#8221; &#8220;dude&#8221; or &#8220;fellow.&#8221; The negative connotations have been attached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights advocates have gone so far as to reject the word &#8220;pet&#8221; and insist on its replacement by &#8220;animal companion.&#8221; Leftist anthropologists go to great lengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. They want to replace the word &#8220;primitive&#8221; by &#8220;nonliterate.&#8221; They seem almost paranoid about anything that might suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive cultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftist anthropologists.) </p>
<p>Those who are most sensitive about &#8220;politically incorrect&#8221; terminology are not the average black ghetto-dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any &#8220;oppressed&#8221; group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness has its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and the majority of whom are heterosexual, white males from middle-class families.</p>
<p>Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being weak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals), or otherwise inferior. The leftists themselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit it to themselves that they have such feelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their problems. (We do not suggest that women, Indians, etc., ARE inferior; we are only making a point about leftist psychology). </p>
<p>By &#8220;feelings of inferiority&#8221; we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strictest sense but a whole spectrum of related traits: low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.</p>

		<p>So where are the posters of offended white people? Are we not a costume, but a race as well? The message I get is it is only offensive if whites dress up as stereotypes. Now if say a Black or an Hispanic dress up as a suicide bomber or a Geisha girl, that must be OK, right? What if a white transvestite dresses as a  Geisha girl or Harem girl? I&rsquo;ll bet the ACLU will defend his right to do so.</p>

		<p>GetBackJack,</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&rsquo;s remind ourselves that these minorities are constantly being programmed, via the media, to be crybabies.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in addition, when they are crybabies, they&rsquo;re rewarded, and if some of them says something bad about their own, they get attacked. Not that it is any less irritating, but well, there but for the grace of God go I, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really funny, even if mostly in a bad way, how a lot (if not all) of minorities and liberals I&rsquo;ve talked with simply lack all conception of how taking offense has two parts. Someone saying/doing something potentially offensive, and then other person taking offense. They simply can&rsquo;t grasp the idea of just not caring because &#8220;well why should I get all hot and bothered because someone else just showed himself to be an idiot?&#8221; or some other reason. They just don&rsquo;t understand that some people are easier to offend than others, and not getting unduly offended is a skill like any other that can be cultivated. To them, taking offense has just one part - something potentially offensive coming up - and like eating to hunger, the only natural reaction is to get offended as easily and viciously as possible.</p>
<p>I kind of pity them, for having been captured by a very bad habit which drives them to frequently exploding anger and bitterness, not to mention alienating lots of people they could have otherwise respected and befriended. I suppose it has its own base pleasures, but so does alcoholism.</p>

		<p>Many years ago, I went to a Halloween party made up as a Rastafarian. The dark brown make-up job was pretty good, if I do say so myself. I topped it off with rolled up jeans revealing a pair of black and gold stripe soccer socks, high topped Converse sneakers, a cheap black wig, and an old knit hat in loud colors. I carried a bottle of wine in a brown paper bag.</p>
<p>When I knocked on the door, a few faces looked out and then nobody came to open it. After about ten minutes, I had to go to a window and yell my name before anyone would let me in. Good thing there weren&rsquo;t any Jamaicans around! </p>

		<p>The &#8220;it&rsquo;s so offensive&#8221; crowd missed a few ethnic stereotypes that get regular play, such as the Costume Store that sells Roman Soldier and Centurian costumes. </p>
<p>Where is the Italian-American saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s my culture, so stop wearing these costumes.&#8221;? The same goes for people who dress up as Mafia Gangsters. That needs to be banned, too. </p>
<p>Stop dressing up like the Lucky Charms leprechaun. That really irks the Irish, yet those commecials keep on running, without a peep from the professional whiners.</p>
<p>German-Americans are sick and tired of people wearing traditional Lederhosen, or better yet, spiked helmets and Military uniforms, and going as the Kaiser, for Halloween. </p>
<p>Since Dracula is an Undead Romanian Count, I suggest that they stop selling Dracula costumes that make fun of the Romanian Nobility, and culture. </p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t want to see anyone wearing faux fur as a berserker, and a horned helmet, and going as a Viking, since that is unique, and culturally significant to the Nordic people.</p>
<p>Kilts should not be worn by anyone, lest they slander the Scots.</p>
<p>Powdered wigs and Colonial American attire should only be for re-enactment groups, and in no way be used as a Costume, since they would belittle those Colonial Americans, and our Founding Fathers. This is our culture, so stop dumping on it. </p>
<p>I better never see a Cowboy hat, such as a well made Stetson, on anyone except a White American, or a working Cowboy or Ranch hand. That goes for coon skin caps, too. </p>
<p>Nothing is more American than these items, and it would really smack of disrespect to our Culture to have non-Americans, and  non-Whites dress up in them. </p>
<p>So, Melissa, if you are going to whine, then cover all the races and ethnic groups of people who could possibly take offense to being parodied. Or, you could just shut the hell up, and let the rest of us have some fun one day out of the year, in this foulded up country.</p>

God forbid that any minority feel made fun of! Yet we whites must be strong and endure the mindless mocking of &ldquo;minorities&rdquo;. <br>
On a side note, it pleases me to see so many whites discussing these racial issues. Though we are not face to face, we are definitely discussing this as a people and that is the first step to getting anything done (even if it is only a fraction of our people). <br>
