		<p>Most of us have known the AG was clearly beholding to his race over the law. Good for Mr. Adams for having the courage to speak out. But even though Holder&rsquo;s shennanigans may be piling up, guess what will happen?&hellip;not a damn thing!<br>

		<p>Holder&rsquo;s obstruction of the Black Panther&rsquo;s case is small potatoes compared to the scandal coming down the pipe that is going by the code-name &#8220;Fast and Furious.&#8221;</p>
<p>http://goo.gl/idSr8</p>
<p>ATF members traded several thousand firearms to Mexican drug cartels in the hopes that the weapons could be tracked to the kingpins. Many guns were lost, Holder disavowed any knowledge of the operation, and later contradicted himself when a memo surfaced showing he had prior knowledge.</p>
<p>Of course, noticing when your president&rsquo;s main appointee in the Justice Department happens to be tracking guns would be rayciss.</p>

		<p>I personally canÂ´t stand Hannity but it&rsquo;s good that this is on his show, because he has a large audience. Not bad and encouraging but why do these guys still, after everything, insist on letting non-whites off the hook. So they&rsquo;re &#8216;racialist&rsquo;, Adams, and they don&rsquo;t have any hate for whitey? Really? You should rethink that one. &#8216;Racialist&rsquo; as you define it describes US. We&rsquo;re just defending ourselves. But no matter, the average Joe will draw the right conclusions.</p>

<p>I think most AR readers know about F&F.;  It is perfectly apparent that it was Obama&rsquo;s attempt to sandbag 2nd Amendment politics.  But the question I want to know, and what hardly anyone seems to want to find out, is this:  Was this also Obama&rsquo;s attempt to sandbag immigration politics?  Had Brian Terry not been assassinated, and the F&F; scandal blown wide open in earnest, I bet Obama would be popping off right now along these lines:  &#8220;How can you right wing bigots oppose amnesty and open borders because of crime when it&rsquo;s your guns causing their crime?&#8221;  The obvious answer, in a world where F&F; was still a secret, would be that &#8220;our guns&#8221; don&rsquo;t seem to cause problems when they&rsquo;re in &#8220;our people&rsquo;s hands,&#8221; it only seems that firearms don&rsquo;t behave very well in ghettos, barrios and Mexico.  If, for example, F&F; was a program that gave AK-47s and grenades to elderly bingo-playing white church ladies, I can assure you it would not have resulted in one violent crime.</p>

		<p>When it blows up, they&rsquo;ll shutter the entire BATFE, which conservatives supposedly want.</p>
<p>Except what will really happen is all the duties of BATFE will then be absorbed by SPLC-DHS, so instead of gun-loving whites enforcing the tyrannical gun laws, it&rsquo;s white-hating liberals who have never even held a gun.</p>
<p>Possibly the first open purge in American government. And that&rsquo;s the &#8220;bad&#8221; scenario. If it had worked out for them, as other commenters have said, watch out. </p>

		<p>I may be incorrect, but my faint recollection is that several years ago the Internal Inspection / oversight/ part of AFT was<br>
transferred from Treasury over to DoJ??  AFT has the most enduring &#8220;reputation&#8221; of any federal law enforcement agency for willfully<br>
disregarding restraints vis a vis constitutional rights.  Reportedly, also, is has had a lot of legally acrobatic involvements with $PLC (??) but it is unclear whether these alleged involvements were prior to, or after, any DoJ &#8220;oversight&#8221;<br>
Anyone have info re this?  </p>

		<p> You know what irritates me is the lack of passion from the talking heads who claim to be conservative. They always approach these issue carefully neutral in vocal tone as if to say &#8220;Be resigned to this development as we can&rsquo;t do anything about this but whimper impotently.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The guest mentions &#8220;radicalization.&#8221; Beware the assertion that someone &#8220;has become radicalized.&#8221; This smear is a recent invention. It labels people who cannot be reasoned with. People who are no longer human and deserve inhuman treatment. </p>
<p>The story typically goes like this: <i> Mr. Badguy went to a meeting <b>and became radicalized.</b> He was thereafter <b>a radical extremist,</b> so we have no choice but&hellip; </i></p>
<p>Do not pick up the verbal weapons of the left, even to turn them against those who typically wield them. Using these verbal dirty tricks lends them the appearance of legitimacy.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still shocked by the lack of outrage on the part of the media and the White public in general over that Mau Mau Shabazz who stood on a Phila. street exhorting Blacks to &#8220;kill the crackers and kill their little babies&#8221;.<br>
I never heard of G. Lincoln Rockwell nor David Duke ever calling for infanticide against Blacks.<br>
It went viral on You Tube and it seems that everyone ignored it.</p>

		<p>He did good work but those people are not racialists they are racists and they hate whites with a violent, murderous hatred. Intimidating voters at the poll, which Holder protected, is organized crime, nothing less. Therefore, this administration is a racist bunch of organized criminals. They are a mafia.</p>
<p>As for people thinking that this was put behind us long ago, pure ignorance or insanity. Anybody who thought THAT has been extremely sheltered and has not had to deal with many blacks or only had to deal with some on the job who were more civil in the interests of protecting their jobs (although blacks are now given much more latitude for malfeasance than whites or than they previously were allowed in more sane times). No sane and intelligent white person with a wide exposure to blacks of all social classes and ages would have thought that. </p>
<p>When you look at what is being taught in schools and the other extensive racist anti-white psyop, the media, it is obvious what has happened. Black and brown anti-white racism is at an all-time high and white self-loathing among many is at an all-time high. A radical, exaggerated anti-white curriculum (and its agents) and corporate media whores are to blame.</p>

<p><i>Why aren&rsquo;t the Republicans calling for an independent investigation and a special prosecutor?</i></p>
<p>They are.  But whether it will go anywhere is anyone&rsquo;s guess:</p>
<p><i>Reps. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) and Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) are asking for an investigation into whether Holder told the truth when he testified that he was unaware of the operation that oversaw the sale of some 2,000 of weapons (mostly semi-auto rifles like AK-47s and AR-180s which can be easily converted to full auto, which ended up in the hands of the Mexican drug cartel. Recent published memos between senior Justice Department officials and Holder suggest otherwise.</i></p>
<p><i>Committee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas sent a letter to President Obama on Tuesday arguing that Holder cannot investigate himself, and requesting the president instruct the Department of Justice to appoint a special counsel.&rdquo;</i></p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t hold it against the author for using the word &#8220;racialist&#8221;.  Nor would I hold his rosy definition of it against him either considering he was on the air. As a rhetorical device, especially when read in print, we all know what its use signifies. It&rsquo;s a way to call someone or thing racist without getting yourself in hot water over that accusation or allowing your detractors to dismiss your arguments by simply reflecting that that same accusation back at you.  He&rsquo;s letting his audience come to that conclusion themselves, which I&rsquo;m guessing won&rsquo;t be hard to do after reading his book. That nuance is necessary right now to reach a larger audience and I&rsquo;m pleased to see he had an awareness of that.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #14. I understand your reasoning and I might be inclined to agree with you. While I was annoyed by it while watching it did occur to me that it was good that he actually put the word &#8216;racialist&rsquo; out there and defined it correctly (as it&rsquo;s evolved), thus allowing those whites who are unsure a way to describe themselves without feeling too nervous about it (for those who are still queasy, which is probably a good portion of Hannity&rsquo;s audience). However, it&rsquo;s hard to tell if this guy actually meant to use it the way you described, I don&rsquo;t know enough about him to tell. As long as people read his book and make the jump to the right conclusion, which is that there is a war on White people. That&rsquo;s the message that has to inform every one of these stories.</p>

		<p>Ref. #08<br>
Today  &mdash;  Oct 10  &mdash;  there is a call for AG Holder to explain why DoJ didn&rsquo;t know what it should have known.  Maybe this growing scandal will be large enough to stimulate some misfit amongst the legions of hedonistic, campus group-think,  lefty  spoon-fed &#8220;reporters&#8221; to investigate the long neglect of effective oversight of BATFE (ATF)??  An outfit like BATFE ought to be of interest at least to CIA, NSA  &mdash;  if no one else.  Who IN REALITY has been in charge of it?  </p>

		<p>If AG Holder was in the dark regarding BATFE, that is supposed to lend some plausibility to the supposition that he knew nothing nothing nothing regarding the destruction of the right of AR to peacefully assemble and indulge in thought crimes and to &#8220;talk dirty&#8221; ipso facto by mentioning overtly the relevant raw facts of science and everyday experience.  The AG seems to be a stark  intellectual and moral mediocrity.   </p>
