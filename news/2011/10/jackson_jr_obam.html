			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Ballasy, Daily Caller, October 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Illinois Democratic Rep. Jesse Jackson, Jr. told The Daily Caller on Wednesday that congressional opposition to the American Jobs Act is akin to the Confederate &#8220;states in rebellion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson called for full government employment of the 15 million unemployed and said that Obama should &#8220;declare a national emergency&#8221; and take &#8220;extra-constitutional&#8221; action &#8220;administratively&#8221;  &mdash;  without the approval of Congress  &mdash;  to tackle unemployment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;President Obama tends to idealize  &mdash;  and rightfully so  &mdash;  Abraham Lincoln, who looked at states in rebellion and he made a judgment that the government of the United States, while the states are in rebellion, still had an obligation to function,&#8221; Jackson told TheDC at his Capitol Hill office on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;On several occasions now, we&rsquo;ve seen &hellip; the Congress is in rebellion, determined, as Abraham Lincoln said, to wreck or ruin at all costs. I believe &hellip; in the direct hiring of 15 million unemployed Americans at $40,000 a head, some more than $40,000, some less than $40,000  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s a $600 billion stimulus. It could be a five-year program. For another $104 billion, we bailout all of the states &hellip; for another $100 billion, we bailout all of the cities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jackson added that his $804 billion stimulus plan is the only way to solve the unemployment crisis. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve got to go further. I support what [Obama] does. Clearly, Republicans are not going to be for it but if the administration can handle administratively what can be done, we should pursue it. And if there are extra-constitutional opportunities that allow the president administratively to put the people to work, he should pursue every single one of them,&#8221; Jackson suggested.</p>

		<p>Along with being a low grade moron, Jesse Junior is also an economic illiterate. </p>
<p>A job is only created when a person or institution has more work than he/she/it and his/her/its current employees can already do, AND the person or institution can afford it, not only in pure monetary terms, but also the ability to comply with the regulatory and legal hassle that comes of hiring someone.</p>
<p>Jesse Junior doesn&rsquo;t want to create real jobs.  All he wants is welfare dressed up as work, aka workfare.</p>

		<p>Maybe we should take &#8220;extra-constitutional opportunities&#8221; to solve the problem of rampant crime by blacks. Declare the criminality of black &#8220;flash&#8221; mobs a &#8220;national emergency&#8221; and take take &ldquo;extra-constitutional&rdquo; action to end this racist and anti-social behavior.</p>

Blacks suffer from &#8216;The Big Chief Syndrome&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Big Chief won so the Big Chief should act like a Big Chief.</p>
<p>To the victor the spoils.</p>
<p>As I said after the election, we&rsquo;re lucky we elected a black man while Whites were still the majority. If blacks were the majority, President Obama would be acting like &#8216;the Big Chief&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Logically, we should see him soon speaking to the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators.  If he had a brain in his head, he would go after such an obvious opportunity for a power grab.</p>
<p>Just because I see it, doesn&rsquo;t mean I want it.  One thing I DO know is that  you can&rsquo;t have large numbers of people losing homes, going hungry, and having no future and NOT expect them to rob and riot.  The future is here.</p>

<p>And it could be suggested that among the Black Caucus in the Congress, Jesse Jr. is perhaps one of the more moderate and more articulate. So what does that say? We all know.</p>

		<p>Jackson Jnr is talking here about printing money and artificially inflating the economy with what is, in reality, faux dollars.</p>
<p>What he and to be honest, Bush before Obama won&rsquo;t face is that to create jobs, a government must lead the way by first creating wealth.  Outsourcing the nation&rsquo;s jobs and selling the nation&rsquo;s industries and resource assets off to foreign countries, is not the way to achieve it as any pea brain should know.</p>
<p>Bogus fixes are the way to go when one is seeking re-election.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters a damn compared with the fight for continued power (at any cost).<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s so predictable and in character that a pol like Junior would look to the Great Expropriator for an example.  Just as Lincoln unconstitutionally stepped in and took the lawfully owned property of the slave owners, thus setting loose upon whites the Great Black Crime Wave, Jesse the lesser wants to take the wealth of present day Americans, by any means necessary, and distribute it to his followers.  And to think, he comes from my city.  How embarrassing it is to be a Chicagoan these days!     </p>

		<p>On our TV news last night we saw an Alabama tomato farmer lamenting over his ruined crop, unpicked because it is now no longer legal to hire illegal immigrants to do this work in that state. The farmer said no Americans want to work all day in the hot sun picking tomatoes. Hey! I picked produce (including tomatoes) for pocket money when I was at high school and this country gets just as hot as the American south.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mrs Jackson Jr can let his followers that there are some REAL jobs out there if they get off their butts and have a look.<br>

<p>Glad to hear that.  Abraham Lincoln did not want blacks to serve on juries and wanted to repatriate the recently freed blacks to Africa.  It&rsquo;s too bad he was assassinated before he could carry out the program.  Then we wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with the likes of Jesse Jackson, Jr.<br>

<p>To the Australian guy, I have been looking for a &#8220;real&#8221; or decent job for a year and havem&rsquo;t gotten hired yet.  It&rsquo;s not as easy as it sounds.  And I have a bachelors degree from an Ivy League university.</p>

<p>In the 70&rsquo;s I picked pears in Victoria, somewhere around Shepparton, I think.  Up and down ladder from sun up til sundown.  The pay was, if memory serves, around $5 per (well filled) cart. Working steadily, I could produce three or so carts a day.  We slept in a bunkhouse.  I remember the dread, in the cool of the dawn, awaiting the moment the sun would break out and start frying us.  The growers relied on students, mostly.  I recall seeing no non whites.  Americans today can&rsquo;t face that kind of labor.  For too long, we&rsquo;ve let the illegals do our stoop work, to the point that we are now too soft for it.  To be fair to the American worker, even the few hardy ones who may be willing to try it are driven away by the pay.  Wages, never much to begin with, have sunk under pressure from the desperate illegals to levels that simply cannot sustain anyone who wants to live above animal level.       </p>

		<p>To Poster #15:</p>
<p>At the risk of sounding insensitive, what exactly is your degree in? Gender Studies? Renaissance Art? Musical Theatre? Polynesian Cultures? I just finished helping (not &#8220;putting&#8221;) my four children through college - NOT Ivy League by any means - and all four are doing just fine, thank you. My older daughter is a nurse anaesthetist. My younger girl is a speech pathologist. My older son (who has a physical disability) is a tool-and-die maker in a manufacturing plant. My younger boy just earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in chemical engineering. They are all well-employed because I sat each of them down in middle school and informed them that college studies were NOT the means to express one&rsquo;s deepest longings to be a hip-hop performer or a movie star or a pro ball player or a novelist. A college education is worthless unless it is predicated upon the acquisition of a skill that is actually in demand - and very likely to stay that way for many years to come. No one cares whether you went to an Ivy League University or a Community College. Your alma mater says nothing about your ability to produce a product or service  so valuable, that someone is actually willing to pay money for it. Quite frankly, the world can get by without any more generic Liberal Arts majors but we can certainly use more petroleum engineers and physicians and skilled machinists.</p>
<p>My advice to you is to consider additional education in a trade school or a graduate program that will provide you with a skill that the economy, in fact, needs. Or, as I told my own children: &#8220;The mountain ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; to Mohammed. So you better strap on your walkin&rsquo; shoes.&#8221;  </p>

<p>You are wrong.Americans now work more hours with less vacation time than any other industrialized country. Our hourly wages also are low compared to other countries. Just because White Americans do jot want to work for unlivable wages does not mean they are soft. The only reason Mexicans do it, is that they send money back home where it is a lot of money. We can thank our criminal Plutocratic class for our current situation.Repulican race traitors even want to lower our wages further.</p>

		<p>@24 at 8:40 a.m. -  Anonymous,</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with you that we Americans are working our butts off for chump change.   These are the same statistics I&rsquo;ve used to argue on other sites that we are grossly underpaid.  For example, we produce, in terms of the value of an hour&rsquo;s work expressed as a percentage of GDP, more than twice the value per hour of the Koreans, who get credit for being such hard workers, while we continually get slammed for not wanting to work.  The blame absolutely goes to our traitorous elites, who have sold us down the river to the global money powers.  I merely wanted to point out that, as a result of these traitorous policies, most Americans have, through no fault of their own, become strangers to the hardest forms of labor - which in previous times we handled quite nicely ourselves -  and that honest manual work no longer pays enough to live on in America .</p>
