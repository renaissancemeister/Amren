<h1><a href="https://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/10/12/rick-perry%E2%80%99s-latino-problem/">Rick Perry&rsquo;s Latino Problem</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, October 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Presidential candidate and Texas Gov. Rick Perry is taking heat from many in his own party for supporting a state policy giving in-state tuition rates to children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>But while this position may be seen as favorable for Latinos  &mdash;  a large majority of Texas&rsquo; illegal immigrants are Latino, with more than 60 percent of them hailing from Mexico alone, according to the Pew Hispanic Center  &mdash;  it hasn&rsquo;t gained him much Latino support in his own state.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of Latino voters in Texas vote Democratic, and Latinos overwhelmingly vote against Perry, a Republican.</p>
<p>In a GOP presidential debate last month, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney criticized Perry for supporting Texas&rsquo; illegal-immigrant tuition policy. Perry responded this way: &#8220;If you say that we should not educate children who have come into our state &hellip; by no fault of their own, I don&rsquo;t think you have a heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the debate, Perry fell from frontrunner status.</p>
<p>Some Texas Latinos came out in support of Perry&rsquo;s stand in that debate, including state Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was happy to hear that,&#8221; Villarreal said of Perry&rsquo;s in-debate response. &#8220;I thought, wow, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen Gov. Perry take a position based on principle at a political cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Villarreal also said Perry&rsquo;s policy priorities, especially cuts to education, have hurt Latino families in Texas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look at the policy outcomes of the last legislative session, and think this is the exact opposite of what Hispanic families want for them and their children,&#8221; Villarreal said.</p>
<p>And many Latino voters apparently feel the same. {snip}</p>

		<p>There is a reason that the republican party is known as the stupid party. And Perry is an excellent example of that. When are these clueless republicans going to stop pandering to minorities and start paying attention to their base, which is almost exclusively Whites? To pander to minorities who have no intention of voting for you and ticking your base off at the same time makes absolutely no sense. At least it makes no sense to me. But then, maybe it does make sense to the politicians of the stupid party. </p>

		<p>Moral of the story:  Open borders Republicans have almost no real support.  Various non-white recent immigrant groups have the Democrat Party, where they get both open borders and more welfare goodies.  Conservative white voters have no use for the Rickrollers of the world.</p>

		<p>THIS is why the Republican Party is called the Stupid Party.  Stupid Republicans like McCain, Perry, yes Romney, etc pander to people who don&rsquo;t like them, never will, never vote for the Republican Party and never will and in doing so piss off their base so even their base is reluctant to vote for them.  They are constantly shooting themselves in the foot trying to get blacks and hispanics to like them and vote for them.  Will NEVER happen.  Firstly, blacks and hispanics have low IQ&rsquo;s therefore limited reasoning powers.<br>
Like children, they want immediate gratification and approval no matter how spoiled or bratty they are.  Secondly, they are too well indoctrinated, easily done due to their low IQ&rsquo;s and &#8220;it&rsquo;s always about ME&#8221; child like attitudes.  They buy in to the class warfare, race warfare, and plantation mentality that the Democrats feed them.  I am GLAD Perry plummeted after saying what he did.  He deserved to.  The problem is we have another panderer, Romney, waiting to replace him and if Romney crashes and burns we have another black man in the wings ready to betray us in favor of his race, after suckering us into believing HE is  different from other blacks.</p>

<p>We Whites should be so proud of the above fact, right? Tell that to Perry and all those just like him.</p>
<p>Maybe one of our so-called WHITE candidates should mention this fact by Pat B.(above) and better yet, make him their VP or Immigration Czar.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;I thought, wow, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen Gov. Perry take a position based on principle at a political cost.&rdquo; Principle? Really? Where is the moral rectitude and principle in selling out your race and nation?  </p>
<p>&ldquo;I look at the policy outcomes of the last legislative session, and think this is the exact opposite of what Hispanic families want for them and their children,&rdquo; Villarreal said. </p>
<p>What about what White families want for their children? Don&rsquo;t White people have a say in their own country that their ancestors fought and died for to give to their descendents and not the world? </p>

		<p>The American GOP has been co-opted and bought out by competing race and religious interests. This is why they adore illegal immigration. It makes the leadership money, it makes the people who bought the leadership money and everyone gets to delude themselves into thinking that they are oh so wonderful and tolerant and celebratory and vibrant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they delude themselves into thinking that under the skin of every Mexican scab roofer and Guatemalan produce picker there resides a White Man GOP Voter. You&rsquo;ve just got to understand them and celebrate them and make them citizens and then convince them with speeches and pamphlets and very impressive graphs and slideshows that they should join the GOP.</p>
<p>Christianity and its all-inclusive nature also brings the alleged right-wing &#8220;Values Voters&#8221; along for the ride. Under the skin of every face-tattooed Mara Salvatrucha is a Latin-chanting, devout Catholic and Lutheran and Pentecostal.</p>

		<p>By most estimates, the German-Americans are the largest single ethnic group in this country, but, in fact, the only public recognition they have received has been bought and paid for by the Deutsch-Amerikaner.  If the Hispanics want more public recognition, let them pay for it.</p>

		<p>It seems to be a kind of sickness, this pandering to a group of people that, minus twenty million or so illegal aliens who can&rsquo;t vote, simply does not have that much power. Of course the real point might be that they have the power to cause trouble. Rational people should draw the appropriate conclusions.</p>

		<p>Rick Perry is a re-run of George Herbert Bush.  Putting him in the White House would merely slow the rate of descent a bit.</p>
<p>Perry&rsquo;s no answer to our problems - he&rsquo;s more like the answer to the question nobody asked.</p>

		<p>The Republican Party isn&rsquo;t the Stupid Party, it&rsquo;s the Crooked Party, the party of con-men that arises in a &#8220;democracy&#8221; where no democratic debate is allowed.  There is nobody so stupid, not even Rick Perry, that they don&rsquo;t understand that Somalians can&rsquo;t contribute anything positive to this society.  They all understand that open borders are disastrous for the nation, the Republican Party, and conservatism.  You can bet that most of them have about the same beliefs as most people here, the same as  most of the commenters on racial stories in any on<br>
-line newspaper.  The Republican/Conservative job in the system is to quash any outbreak of white interests in American politics, and their reward is access to the system for personal gain and to promote the interests of their employers, the rich.  They&rsquo;re not stupid, they&rsquo;re crooks and traitors.  Helping them to pretend they&rsquo;re hapless by putting their actions off to stupidity simply helps them cover their crimes. </p>
<p>This site does a lot of stories on racial violence toward whites.  When was the last time you heard a Republican or establishment Conservative make an issue out of one of these crimes, even a blatant and vicious one like the Knoxville Horror?  When have you ever heard them admit that any such crimes EVER take place?   This is the level of control that the Liberal velvet dictatorship has over its phony political opposition.   </p>

		<p>Anon #5: How about Ron Paul-Pat Buchanan, or Pat Buchanan-Ron Paul in 2012?</p>
<p>Flip it any way you like it. It won&rsquo;t matter to me, because we will either have a leader who wants to end our involvment in the UN, and Audit the Federal Reserve, while respecting our Constitution, or we will have a strong Nationalist leader who respects our Constitution, but is decidedly more vocal on the Cultural issues that threaten this country.</p>
<p>Either way, we win. </p>

<p>I was SHOCKED when I looked at the TV and saw that Gov. Perry, a Republican, had said that.  I heard it, but at first I wasn&rsquo;t looking at the TV and assumed it was a Democrat.  As soon as I realized Perry had said that, I thought &#8220;Yep, he&rsquo;s done for.&#8221;  People in the audience were actually booing him.</p>
