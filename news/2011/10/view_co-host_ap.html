			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Real Clear Politics, October 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the &#8216;Hot Topics&rsquo; segment on &#8220;The View&#8221; this morning, the ladies discussed a Washington Post story about a rock with the word &#8220;Niggerhead&#8221; written on it at the gated entrance of a hunting camp leased and frequented by Rick Perry and his father.</p>
<p>Host Barbara Walters used the n-word while explaining the story, causing co-host Sherri Shepherd to take offense. Shepherd says she didn&rsquo;t like the way Barbara Walters said it. However, Shepherd was okay with Whoopi Goldberg, the main host of &#8220;The View,&#8221; using it. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;When I heard you (Whoopi) say it, it was fine. You said it a different way. When I heard you (Barbara) say it, I didn&rsquo;t like the way you said it. Because when you say it, you say [inaudible]. And I don&rsquo;t like [inaudible],&#8221; Shepherd said.</p>
<p>This left Barbara Walters confused and wanted to know the proper way to say the n-word. However, Shepherd told Walters there is no right way for her to say it.</p>
<p>Walters said the n-word once in the segment while Whoopi Goldberg used the word nearly a dozen times.</p>

		<p>This is the epitome of the long standing double standard when it comes to the allowed conduct of people base on race.  I am glad this has happened because it helps expose the double standard and open-faced hypocrisy of Whoopie Goldberg and people like her.  As for Sherri Shepherd, too dumb for words.</p>

		<p>The real point is, who cares what any of these knuckleheads think? Who made these nitwits the new social policy analysts?</p>
<p>Instead of worrying about who says a certain word they should ponder why it is that all those who you can&rsquo;t say the word about are in prison or can&rsquo;t read or are on welfare.</p>

		<p>The way Spanish is bw3coming more prevalent in the USA, the word &#8220;negra&#8221; will be OK to use soon but only by those with good diction.  That will cause som misplaced ire.  But how about a lot of irate complaints from whites at the public use of the word?  Play them at their own game.</p>

		<p>Although I enjoyed watching rabid liberal Barbara Walters get b  &mdash;    &mdash;   slapped by her noble colored folks, I was appauled that this no-body Sherri Shepherd would disrespect her on HER SHOW on national t.v. over such a non-issue. While I don&rsquo;t agree with Ms. Walters opinions, I do have a certain respect for her. Gosh, I still remember getting up before dawn to go to school and seeing her on the Today show back in the late 60&rsquo;s when this Sherri was still in diapers! If I were Ms. Walters I would&rsquo;ve told this black heifer that I don&rsquo;t give a damn what she doesn&rsquo;t like and that this is MY show and I&rsquo;ll say and do as I please and if she doesn&rsquo;t like it, hit the road!      </p>

		<p>I very rarely tune in to The Spew anymore, but I unfortunately had tuned in to this little debacle. And tuned out just as quickly. Sherri Shepherd is one of the biggest reasons I will not watch this show anymore. She has to be one of the most ignorant people I have ever heard. And they give this fool a national platform. In this particular instance she kept going on and on and on about how bad Barbara saying the N word made her feel. But not Whoopi! Talk about playing the race card. She never misses an opportunity to do it either. </p>
<p>On the Friday of Prince William and Kate&rsquo;s wedding, when they were showing film of people seated in Westminster Abbey on the View, Sherri lets out with &#8220;where are all the black people at?&#8221;. Yes, she could be that ignorant, thinking black people should be at every function that takes place in this world. Or just pushing the black agenda. Either way it&rsquo;s extremely crude and annoying. The View lost me when they hired her.</p>

		<p>Yeah and I&rsquo;m SURE Sherri and Whoopie ALWAYS refer to Whites as White people. Everyone knows that Whoopie just lives to play the race card on timid weak minded White people. I got a kick out of watching poor Joy during this film clip, she was clearly very uncomfortable with the subject being discussed. Watch the clip again and look at her face and hands constantly fidgeting.</p>

Why should a self- respecting white man or woman care what a marxist, liberal, PC IDIOT says, thinks, or fantasizes, about such matters?<br>
This is a lower intellectual / sociopolitical pursuit, than commenting on the drooling babble of  a couple of  two- year olds who are squabbling with one another.<br>
These people are fools of the lowest order, serving an utterly decadent and mindless network, media and audience. Shiftless parasites, devoid of brains or conscience. I&rsquo;d literally cross the street to avoid them, and wouldn&rsquo;t urinate on their heads, if they were on fire.<br>

		<p>All of the white women on this show disgust me. Elizabeth is the lone &#8220;conservative&#8221; who makes us all look like fools by shying away from certain issues and agreeing with her &#8220;sistas&#8221; on here when a Republican acts &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Either you are conservative or you are not.  She made a spectacle of herself the day after Obama got elected, talking about how she is &#8220;ready to support him&#8221;, basically throwing everything she had been fighting for the previous year out the window.  Does she realize how obnoxious she appears and how bad she makes conservatives look?  And of course, here, in this video, she once again takes the black victim&rsquo;s side by trying to make a point with &#8220;if I said broccoli and it offended you, and you tell me, then I wouldn&rsquo;t say it anymore&#8221;.  The whole point here, is that it is a double standard that blacks can use the N word when reporting on it, but whites cant.  But Elizabeth was too consumed with proving she wasn&rsquo;t racist to notice that.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that Whites are still afraid to use this word. The world is unbalanced. The longer Whites allow themselves to be pushed around by the world, the harder it will be to fight back. Blacks find the N word offensive. Well I find blacks using White girls in their filthy porn movies and calling them White whores offensive. Wake up Whites. The world is invading you land.

		<p>While I am not a fan of either woman, I just don&rsquo;t understand the logic that it&rsquo;s acceptable for one group (in this case, blacks) to use it, but not other races. If a word is deemed vulgar in a language, it should be deemed vulgar no matter what race the person is.  Then again, it does speak of their relatively low intelligence  &mdash;  -they are willing to use a vulgar word to refer to themselves. Even if the user doesn&rsquo;t show their face or their face is obscured, I can see who a black person is online, such as on Twitter and so on. They always refer to themselves using that word. </p>

		<p>I was vaguely aware that Barbara Walters and Whoopi Goldberg had a show called The View. But I&rsquo;ve never seen it nor ever heard of Sherri Shepherd. After watching this clip I am reminded of why I canceled my cable subscription. I never bothered to get an HDTV antenna so that means no TV for me. And I don&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>The bigger issue concerning the name of Perry&rsquo;s camp is that Cain tried to use it to score points after he had repeatedly assured people that he would not be racial. The issue isn&rsquo;t as much the race card as the betrayal. You can&rsquo;t stake your candidacy on not playing the race card and then go back on it. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that Obama has done worse as the &#8220;post racial&#8221; president because no one believed him. But people believed Cain and he lost their trust when he did that. He might as well drop out now. Because his candidacy is over.</p>

		<p>Minorities always hide behind double standards. They always have to have this feigned outrage. Yawn.  And white liberals have to have a feigned contrition for upsetting these abused minorities. Babwa waa waa got &#8220;chills&#8221; from saying this word that may not be uttered. Oh, ofcourse she did. Well I get chills also. I get chills from watching the absurdity which is the view, the leftist view that is. Elizabeth is  a useless, mealy mouthed,  semi conservative. The rest of them are leftists, with Sherri just being simple minded.</p>
<p>Maybe whites should feign outrage at still being called white. Everytime a minority calls a white person white they should demand to be called European Americans. Say that we don&rsquo;t mind if other whites call us white, but blacks and hispanics must call us European Americans or it is racism on their part. </p>
<p>And by the way,(this may be a tiny bit off point),  didn&rsquo;t the 70&rsquo;s tv show the Jefferson&rsquo;s become popular because the main character used the racist term honkey to describe whites? I have yet to see a tv show where the character says the  word that cannot be mentioned and it being popular. Even Archie Bunker didn&rsquo;t say that unmentionable word. Plus Bunker was portrayed as just a stupid white guy.   I am sure that Whoopi and Sherri have already denounced the jeffersons show at some point in time as being racist. And they would NEVER EVER use the term Honkey or cracker. No, ofcourse not. </p>
<p>To say that I am grasping at straws. Maybe, I am simply following the minority example tho. </p>

		<p>Shows like these are nothing more than social propoganda. This was probably all scripted to cause a controversy and raise ratings. The masses eat this up. For me, I cant watch a minute of it.

		<p>Shepherd has made statements on that show that will make your jaw drop. Youtube her name and sort through the results if you have any impulse to take this woman seriously. Here&rsquo;s a couple:</p>
<p>1. She justified not knowing whether the earth was round by claiming to be too busy raising her children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>2. She believes that Christians were the first civilization.</p>
<p>Idiocy!</p>

		<p>The purpose of &#8220;The View&#8221; is to train the audience to hold certain opinions. The persuasion is not done with reasoned argument but by demonstrating emotional approval/disapproval and relying on the viewer&rsquo;s instinctive tendency to copy and conform. </p>
<p>One of the performers onstage mentions an issue and the other performers take turns reacting to it. Emotion is 95% of the argument. Facial expressions and body language convey the performer&rsquo;s view. The audience  &mdash;  a proxy for the home viewer  &mdash;  is cued to applaud or groan and camera angles are chosen to show other performers nodding in sympathy or grimacing in dismay. By the time a subject has received the full treatment, there has usually been no real debate or logical inquiry, but the viewer at home has been shown what the approved viewpoint is by nonverbal means.</p>

		<p>I agree that Walters probably associates mainly with whites.  If she had no idea how the black mind operates, let this serve as a quick and hard lesson.  Unless you want to become entangled in an asinine, pointless, race-baiting debate, it&rsquo;s best to avoid any semblance of the &#8220;n&#8221; word no matter how innocuous the context.  The fact that blacks tend to make an issue of a non-issue is already a given.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised no commenter has brought up a previous run-in that Barbara Walters had with this word. Would have been about 30 years ago, when she interviewed the (massively overrated) black comedian Richard Pryor. As I recall, Walters asked Pryor something like &#8220;Now, you call yourself [N-word] a lot. Why do you do that?&#8221; If memory serves, Pryor flew off the handle at the mere mention of the word, chastising Walters for using it, and &#8220;reasoning&#8221; that &#8220;It&rsquo;s OK for ME to say that word but not YOU!&#8221;</p>
<p>This despite the fact that Walters was only quoting Pryor himself. It was, in fact, a word that Pryor not only used CONSTANTLY in his standup act, but had even used in the TITLES of some of his 1970s comedy albums, including &#8220;Bicentennial [N-word]&#8221; and &#8220;That [N-word]&rsquo;s Crazy!&#8221;</p>

		<p>My Moniker says it all. Whites should embrace &#8220;Cracker&#8221; as it has its roots of empowerment in the days of segregation. Wgile it is offensive to some Whites, the black social groups also use it with impunity. We are all equal now, remember? I agree with the other bloggers.

<p>All of the white women on this show disgust me. Elizabeth is the lone &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; who makes us all look like fools by shying away from certain issues and agreeing with her &ldquo;sistas&rdquo; on here when a Republican acts &ldquo;racist&rdquo;. Either you are conservative or you are not. She made a spectacle of herself the day after Obama got elected, talking about how she is &ldquo;ready to support him&rdquo;, basically throwing everything she had been fighting for the previous year out the window. Does she realize how obnoxious she appears and how bad she makes conservatives look? And of course, here, in this video, she once again takes the black victim&rsquo;s side by trying to make a point with &ldquo;if I said broccoli and it offended you, and you tell me, then I wouldn&rsquo;t say it anymore&rdquo;. The whole point here, is that it is a double standard that blacks can use the N word when reporting on it, but whites cant. But Elizabeth was too consumed with proving she wasn&rsquo;t racist to notice that.<br>

<p>So true. Elizabeth is no different from the rest of the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; in the mainstream and the GOP. Sooo afraid of being a &#8220;racist&#8221;. She can have her &#8220;sistas&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t anyone else noticed yet how all these &#8220;conservatives&#8221; (Hannity, Levin, O&rsquo;Reilly, Fox news, etc) all lambast any WHITE person who may be racist and says so and the reasons why? They cannot tolerate any White telling the truth about race, yet they all downplay race when it concerns what blacks say and do&hellip;</p>
<p> Also Barbara Walters dated (and loved) a BLACK man, I believe he was a congressman at that time. Back in the 70&rsquo;s or 80&rsquo;s if I remember correctly. I saw her give some interview on TV where she admitted the whole thing.</p>

<p>Meredith:</p>
<p>There was related post discussing this topic earlier this year and I commented on my feelings about the word at the time. I agree with you totally. The word is DISGRACEFUL! No one of any race should use it!&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with the idea that certain words aren&rsquo;t used in polite circles.  But what to do when the circles have become unbalanced and not polite?  Or only some are forcefully reminded to be polite? </p>
<p>My big problem with all this is that we as whites are being dictated on what is allowed to be said by people who don&rsquo;t understand what they are talking about and have no compunction over being rude, unfair, even violent over the issue.  The other big problem is that when you allow one ignorant segment of the population to make using any word politically, then even legally disallowed, they can progress to other words and symbols that they don&rsquo;t understand or create their own politically charged meanings.  We saw it with &#8220;niggardly,&#8221; for example.  Some have pointed out that negra is Spanish for black.  Negger is German for &#8220;black person.&#8221;  Considering the long history of Spanish Florida, Louisiana and German immigration in the U.S., the problematic connotation of the &#8220;N&#8221; word seems to have come from the blacks themselves.  </p>
<p>Then we have the problem with actual African nations and locations such as Niger and Nigeria, etc. I sometimes have wondered when the populations there will grow self conscious enough to change the names?  Or maybe it doesn&rsquo;t bother them at all?</p>
<p>Blacks have long practiced and enlarged upon a collection of derogatory pejoratives for whites that I even Amren has no problem allowing here; Cracker, Honky, Peckerwood, Snowflake, Whitey, and I don&rsquo;t know what else.  Blacks seem to have always been talented and given to name calling.</p>
<p>Most everyone I grew up around had been called some name or called names at someone else.  Our parents taught us to just take it and say, &#8220;Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never harm me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Words can only harm when saying them are denied.  It has always been up to the listener to listen or ignore them.  America ceased to be a free country when we bowed to language control as a binding, social/legal mandate applicable to one group with another exempt.  I grew up taught that the saying the &#8220;N&#8221; word was naughty, like other bad words.  But when I am repeatedly told in the most hypocritical manner that I cannot say a word, I want to shout it out, loudly.  </p>
<p>Words like this that become political tools, including &#8220;racist&#8221; need to be used and so deprived of their power.  Liberals traditionally do what conservatives tell them is wrong or taboo, just for the shock value and for a &#8220;better and fuller expression of freedom.&#8221;  So the reasons become very obvious and go far beyond manners and politeness.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s really a disgraceful word at all.  Lots of blacks act like it, and if the shoe fits, wear it!  Of course they call each other that all the time&hellip;and one has to keep in mind that a lot of blacks more or less celebrate the thug culture.</p>
<p>I think some people are still brainwashed into thinking that whites treated the blacks oh so terribly, and the N-word is part of that.  I don&rsquo;t think they were treated terribly at all for the most part.  Lynchings?  That was done to people who committed crimes, black or white.</p>
<p>Way back when, the N-word was used all the time.  Of course, that was back when &#8220;gay&#8221; meant &#8220;happy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This entire topic is so puerile.  Words only have whatever &#8220;power&#8221; we invest in them.  No words should EVER inspire anyone to violence.  No words EVER justify shooting someone.  There used to be something in this ONCE free country known as &#8220;free speech.&#8221;  Don&rsquo;t take my word for it!  You can read about it in the Bill of Rights&hellip;whatever that was&hellip;</p>
<p>Look.  I am handicapped&hellip;crippled&hellip;whatever.  I am not &#8220;differently-abled.&#8221;  I grew up in hospitals for CRIPPLED children, for chrissake!  (Don&rsquo;t ask me why the United Negro College Fund &amp; the NAACP don&rsquo;t change their names&hellip;)  If my best friend were to call me a cripple, that might sting (but, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t shoot him), but why should some stranger&rsquo;s &#8220;calling me a name&#8221; bother me in the slightest?<br>
But in the topsy-turvy world of the American black, it&rsquo;s the exact opposite.  They pass around the n-word amongst themselves like they would share a crack pipe!  But why should blacks care if the Grand Wizard of the Kuses the n-word?  Do they really value his opinion so much?</p>

		<p>Sherri is 100% correct the n-word has been used amongst Blacks for years and communicated differently with multiple meanings, from funny to even sensual. Used in certain ways only Black American people could understand.<br>
When White people say it the weight of history and the echo of slave-master&rsquo;s whip can be heard and it can ONLY be a slur.  I think white do not even have the ABILITY to say it in a way that it could be considered funny like Richard Pryor did or Chris Rock does; I am talking about ability not permission.

<p>#29 Meredith &amp; Mrs White Manners: </p>
<p>A noble sentiment and one born entirely out of basic common decency perpetuated and evolved by whites to assist in peaceful co-existence. However when one or more other races don&rsquo;t play by the same rules as you do, then you will invariably be doomed by your own contraints and sensibilities. Not many, in fact no other race affords whites anywhere near the same consideration.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t sit well with denigrating an entire race with a very degrading epithet, but truth be told the majority deserve the tag. -It didn&rsquo;t come about by accident! I am however very aware that there is a minority of blacks who supercede decency and intelligence against some of our fellow whites in spades, thereby breaking the racial stereotypes down; therin lies the rub in generalising a whole race.</p>
<p>The problem is, that most folks have to go by a &#8220;general&#8221; rule of thumb when meeting people of other races for the first time. If this necessitates a defensive reaction based on historical and overwhelming precedents, then so be it.</p>
<p>The N word is just a word. If a word can provoke so much violence and is fine if spoken by the people it&rsquo;s applied to, then I suggest it&rsquo;s just a question and mix of reasonable self-control, objectivity and a huge inferiority complex if people of said race can&rsquo;t deal with it.- Its just a word. Rise above it and take the sting out of it&rsquo;s tail.</p>

<p>Barbara&rsquo;s final sentence should be taken to heart by all whites; I have said many times that when others fear us as much as we have apparently come to fear them, then things will finally change (or change back, as it were).              </p>

		<p>I actually watch this clip on TV and if any white person watches it.<br>
I am a racist I have pride in my skin color and I have come to the point in life I think some thing is worth fighting for.</p>
<p>I support a totally white america and only white and if it means the total collapse of the american government so be it they have sold out the white man for the purpose of his elimination and we must fight this all racial diversity is the elimination of the white man and the white man has to rise up to fight this or die.</p>

<p>&#8220;This reinforces the adage, which still holds very true today  &mdash;  <br>
There is no such thing as cheap labor!&#8221;</p>
<p>Very good point!! CA is just figuring this out with the wave of &#8220;undocumented workers&#8221; coming across our Southern border.<br>
We should have picked our own cotton/tobacco and need to pick our own grapes.</p>
