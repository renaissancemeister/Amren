<h1>Hatred of Arabs Deeply Rooted in Persians, Says Iranian Intellectual</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Saud Al-Zahed, Al Arabiya News, October 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The relationship between Arabs and Persians has always been a source of controversy, not only owing to the contemporary power struggle in the region, but also because of a long history of rivalry that formed an integral part of the national psyche of both people. Iranian intellectual Sadek Zibakalam provides deep insight into the different levels of this enduring animosity. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think the majority of Iranians of all types hate Arabs, and I believe they hate us, too,&#8221; Sadek Zibakalam, who is also a professor at the University of Tehran, said in an interview with the Iranian weekly Sobh Azade.</p>
<p>Zibakalam said there is a link between racism and a lack of education, and pointed out that this is the case in Europe, where people who express hatred against Jews or Muslims or foreigners are mostly uneducated. However, the situation tends to be different in Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;The phenomenon of hating Arabs is very common among intellectuals in Iran,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added that religious people also frequently express their resentment of Arabs, which usually comes in the form of curses directed at Sunnis.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, Iranians&rsquo; constant attacks on Sunnis stem from their hatred of Arabs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This hatred, Zibakalam argued, is not the product of the current hegemony conflict in the region, as many people might suspect, but has its roots in history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Persians will never forget their defeat at the hands of Arabs in the Battle of Qadisiya 1,400 years ago. It is as if a fire keeps seething under the ashes and is waiting for the right moment to explode,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Iran&rsquo;s attempts to gain supremacy in the region are not triggered by political ambition as much as by a racist drive that pushes Iranians to prove they are superior, the professor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever Iran issues any fiery statement about our neighbors in the U.A.E, Qatar, or Kuwait, you can easily detect that they revolve around a belief that Persians are superior. Listen to our foreign minister, parliament speaker, or even mosque imams, and you will notice that derogatory tone they use and which focuses on the racial and not the political superiority of Persians.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cited the example of the U.A.E., which many Iranians, politicians and clergy derides in their statements.</p>
<p>&#8220;They would say that if Iranians just blow some air across the Persian Gulf, they would wipe the U.A.E off the map,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When asked whether the stance of the people is similar to that of the government as far as hatred of Arabs is concerned, Zibakalam replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, people are like the government, and may be even more racist and intolerant.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, he said, when a couple of years ago the U.A.E said it was not going to drop its opposition to Iran&rsquo;s occupation of three disputed Islands in the Gulf and referring to the &#8220;Persian Gulf,&#8221; large numbers of people rallied in front of the U.A.E embassy in Tehran with a cake that had 35 candles: they were making fun of the U.A.E&rsquo;s 35-year history, compared to Iran&rsquo;s 2,500.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Iranians also criticize their compatriots who travel to Arab countries. For example, they always ask why they would go and spend their money in Arab countries, while they never do the same with Turkey, where huge numbers of Iranians go.</p>
<p>&#8220;This even applies to religious trips to the Arab world, while if Mecca or Karbala were in Turkey or Malaysia, Iranians would not have a problem with people going there,&#8221; Zibakalam said.<br>
He added that Persian racism against Arabs becomes very clear in language, and that the establishment of the Persian Language Institute was intended to carry out a plan to remove Arabic words from the Persian language. </p>
<p>&#8220;Arabic words that have been in the Persian language for more than 1,00 years would be removed even though they are mentioned in great literary works like The Shahnameh and the poetry of Rumi, all of which are parts of our history.&#8221; </p>
<p>Zibakalam also admitted that this &#8220;racism&#8221; for which Iranians are known is not practiced against Arabs only, but also against other non-Persian ethnicities inside Iran.</p>
<p>&#8220;If for example we take jokes as an indication of the way we view people, you will find how the Turkmens and the Lur are the most ridiculed in our jokes.&#8221;</p>
<p>That same goes for other groups, such as Kurds and the Baluchi, he added.</p>
<p>Zibakalam was born in 1948 to a Shiite family in Tehran and obtained his Ph.D. in political science from the University of Bradford in the U.K. He is currently a member of the Scientific Association at Tehran University.</p>
<p>Zibakalam was a critic of the Shah and a supporter of former Prime Minister Mohamed Mossadeq. He was sent to jail for two years during the Shah&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Zebakalam held several government positions and played a major role in the Iranian Cultural Revolution, in which academics who did not toe the line of the new republic were dismissed. He, however, expressed his regret for taking part in the revolution and issued a direct apology. </p>
<p>One of the things known about Zebakalam is that he has never belonged to any party, and that he criticizes both conservatives and reformists. He is also said to be close to former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p>

		<p>Maybe so, but the Arabs have ultimately won. They imposed - through subjugation to Islam - their values culture and supremacy upon the otherwise far more advanced Persians. Islam is all about Arab imperialism. The conquered non-Arab peoples were always too brainwashed to understand this. It reminds me of an Indian Hindu scholar who pointed out that the sub-continent&rsquo;s muslims have been conquered twice, once by the British, and earlier and much more effectively by the Arabs. </p>

<p>Read Richard Weaver&rsquo;s &#8220;Life Without Prejudice,&#8221; 1957, in Modern Age.  Don&rsquo;t just read it, study it often, as you would Cranmer&rsquo;s prayers in the Book of Common Prayer, 1928.</p>

		<p>Iranians are NOT White Europeans. They need to stop calling themselves Aryans. Same thing with Egyptians, they call themselves true Egyptians, but it was recently released that King Tut was White European, so how many other Pharaohs and the greater population were White?  </p>

		<p>Persians belonged to the Shiite sect since native Persian monarchs took over from Sunni Arab governers in the 16th century and re-introduced pre-Islamic Zoroastrian festivals at the same time as Shi&rsquo;ism, which became a way to preserve their Aryan non-Arab identity within Islam, so Shi&rsquo;ism is a very Persian thing, like Protestantism is to Germanic people. Also: US ally S.Arabia&rsquo;s richest oil fields are in Shi&rsquo;ite provinces, 1/4 of Saudis are pro-Iran Shi&rsquo;tes and Iran is allied to Russia.</p>

		<p>The true Iranians were Germanic and were know for their red hair. Europeans have been subverted by Marxism to think that you have to like the whole world and that the whole world should come to your lands and settle. To hell with that. Racial, ethnic and cultural survival are everything. Do these people honestly think an &#8220;education&#8221; will solve this problem. Racism isn&rsquo;t the problem; Europeans giving up their lands to foreign people is the problem! Things are unbalanced right now because Europeans have lost their backbone. Remember, at one point, Europeans dominated around 85% of the world. </p>

		<p>Persians are completely different from arabs, even if few pure Persians exist today.  It needs to be stressed that it was Persians, Greeks, and Hindus (all Indo-European) responsible for most of the math achievements that are attributed to arabs. I am getting tired of hearing about &#8220;arab mathematics&#8221;.  There is no such thing.</p>

		<p>My HS history teacher spoke of an Indo-Aryan people that split into three branches:  one branch in northwest India, one in Persia, and the third making its way to the Baltic States, particularly Lithuania.  I&rsquo;d be skeptical of this if it weren&rsquo;t for one fact:  the concave &#8220;ski-jump&#8221; nose shape with a bulb on the end seems to appear only among Lithuanians and northwest Indians.  (I am very conscious of this issue as I am half Lithuanian and throughout childhood had to deal with taunts of &#8220;Ski Jump&#8221;, &#8220;Bignose&#8221; and similar, all from outside the Lithuanian community.  In college, I commonly ran into Indians with identical, although brown, noses.)</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t recall ever seeing a Persian with this nose though&hellip;.<br>

		<p>Henry 7:14- You are displaying a deep ignorance of historical fact. As much as it might disturb you, there are only two groups of people who have consistently and continuously referred to themselves as Aryans for thousands of years- the Persians and Hindus. There is no serious debate about that fact.<br>
the name Iran means Aryan. And India used to be called Aryavarta, which means &#8220;Land of the Aryans&#8221; in Classical Sanskrit.<br>
The Persian language, as well as Sanskrit, Hindi,etc., are Indo-European languages and are directly related to the languages of Europe.<br>
At no point in European history, prior to the 19th century, did Europeans refer to themselves as Aryans.<br>
The Persians and Hindus have every right to refer to themselves as Aryans, because they are the inheritors of the culture and languages of the ancient Aryans.</p>

		<p>The ancient Persian stock was indeed much more white than what we see today. They simply lost to kinky hair, dark skin and eyes, and lower intelligence.</p>
<p>And Where are the Greeks of antiquity? Look at the statues that depict truly European features&hellip;are these people alive in Greece today? Perhaps just traces of their DNA&hellip;</p>
<p>And Lebanon: This was NOT an Arab culture. Those people were incredibly industrious, inventive and forward-thinking; centuries ahead of their neighbors. They were incredible traders, seafarers, navigators, explorers. They gave the Greeks their alphabet, for crying out loud. The only reason we have so little of their writing, is that they wrote on papyrus, which decays.  <br>
Theirs was NOT an Islamic place or people. The ancient Lebanese shared far more with the Greeks of antiquity, than they did with the semites. Lebanon was a Christian place, during, and after the time of Jesus.<br>
 Lebanese people absolutely HATED being arabized. Over the centuries, and most tragically in the last three generations, Lebanon has been swamped by low IQ, violent palestinians and other arabs. There was a large exodus of real Lebanese in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Some were more semitic, and some were more European. But they were fleeing the browning of their country, as we flee the browning of our towns and states.<br>
I&rsquo;d imagine &#8220;Persians&#8221; feel just the same. Even if they are already browned, they hate the browner ones.<br>
Hell, there are many Lebanese even today who are indistinguishable from Italians  and other Mediterranean Europeans, like the Southern French. (Who of course look the way they do, due to miscgenation&hellip;<br>
There still just a few white people with blond and red hair, and green eyes in Pakistan&hellip;<br>
All this just goes to warn us that white genes get swallowed up in the miscgenation.<br>
It&rsquo;s happened down through the ages to white, or near white peoples.<br>
Let&rsquo;s make sure we retain this last bit!<br>

		<p>How &#8220;Aryan&#8221; are the Parsees?  They have certainly prospered as an exiled cultural community more endogamous than the Jews.  &#8220;Inbreeding&#8221; has done them no harm.  What is their racial relationship to Iranians of Zoroaster&rsquo;s time, west Europeans and the Islamified Iranians today?<br>

		<p> Iranians (Persians) should be considered Mediterranean whites. Many could pass for Southern Italians or Greeks. They come from an ancient civilization that was the chief rival of Rome in the later Roman Empire. Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism, which had profound theological influences on Judaism, Christianity and Islam, both originated in ancient Persia.  Iranians also have a very rich poetical tradition. I&rsquo;ve personally found Iranians to be a big hearted and very friendly people. Yes, there is an ugly strain of fanatical belief in Shia Islam, but there is also a sublime Sufi mysticism as well. </p>
<p>I would consider Iranians to be a threat to Western/White Civilization only to the degree that they harbor fanatical Islamic beliefs. Of course, I would not support massive immigration of Iranians into Europe or the United States, but I oppose most non European immigration anyway.  </p>

		<p>During the was between Iran and Iraq the policy of the Reagan administration was to support the side that was losing the war. The policy was not to help that side win the war, but to avoid losing so that the war would continue. If the side began to win, American support shifted to the other side. <br>
 <br>
This continued until the arms for hostage deal was exposed. At that point the Reagan administration was afraid that Iran would win, and that an Iranian victory would be blamed on Reagan. Many Reagan supporters hated Iran as much as the Soviet Union. Consequently, Iraq was given enough support to force Iran to sign a peace treaty that gave Iraq enough territory to claim victory.<br>
 <br>
The policy of the Reagan administration was obviously not something to announce in a speech before the United Nations. Nevertheless, it was a clever and wise policy. The Muslims are going to be in a lethal mood for at least a generation. It is in our interest to encourage them to direct their lethal energies against each other. </p>

		<p>The problem with Sadek Zibakalam&rsquo;s exhortation to end prejudice against Arabs is that the Arabs have no intention of ending their prejudice against others. All he will accomplish is to disarm Persians and leave them at the mercy of their enemies. Not that I&rsquo;m some great Persian supporter or anything. I&rsquo;m just calling it like I see it.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The phenomenon of hating Arabs is very common among intellectuals in Iran,&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is true with regards to Iranian &amp; Arab students as well. When I lived in the dormitory at Moscow State University, there were many Iranians and Arabs. Here are my general impressions of the two groups. Keep in mind that MSU is top university in Russia, and the best option for middle easterners so those whom I lived with were from the select class.</p>
<p>Persian Iranians are wealthier, well dressed, and mostly respectful in public.  In general they appeared whiter than Arabs. Iranians were able to mix socially with Western foreigners, mostly Americans mostly due to their ability to adopt Western mannerisms and a keener ability to speak both Russian and English. They are quick to remind you that they are not Arab and speak openly about not liking Arabs.</p>
<p>Arabs are darker and have a mistrust look in eyes. Most do not have  the intellect to succeed in academics and are known for paying for their marks. They have no aptitude for foreign language or for learning in general, hence they have only Arab friends. </p>
<p>The middle eastern group preferred above all are the Kurds from Iran and Iraq. They are gentlemen in general and pursue education to return to their countries. They also are very White looking.</p>

<p>No one ever said they are Europeans.  Ever look at a map? Iran is not in Europe.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a Persian?  I doubt it.  It is true that the present day Egyptians are not descendants of the ancient Egyptians.  The present present day Egyptians are a combination of the 700 AD Arab conquerors and their black slaves.</p>
<p>Persians cannot be distinguished from any other Whites. Many are black haired brown eyed brunettes.  But not all are black haired brown eyed brunettes.  There is  a lot of fair skin, hazel and gray blue eyes and brown hair among Persians.  </p>
<p><br>
I live in a Persian neighborhood and see Persians all the time.  I went to high school and college with them.  I work with them.  Most of the independent businesses in my neighborhood are owned by Persians.</p>
<p>I know what they look like.  Do you?</p>

<p>Someone else who has never seen a Persian.</p>
<p>Persians do not have kinky hair and dark skin.  That is because they never imported black slaves.  African slaves were too far away.  Persians imported their slaves through the Black and Caspian seas from Ukraine, Crimea, Circassia, Caucasia and Russia. So whatever they were 5,000 years ago, they mixed with Whites, not  blacks as the arabs did.</p>
<p>Anglo Saxon Scotch Irish and German Whites betrayed their own.  It was Anglo Saxon and Scotch Irish Judges and a German President<br>
(Eisenhower) who destroyed our city school systems, many of our cities and subjected White students and teachers to the horrors of school busing and integration.</p>
<p>In California other than a few people like Bon, most American Whites are race traitors who put blacks, Asians and Hispanics above Whites.</p>
<p>The White immigrants, Russians, Persians, Armenians, and Israelis are the only Whites who have not succumbed to race suicide.</p>
<p>I would far rather talk to a Persian or Armenian about racial issues than one of my liberal, anti White Anglo Saxon ethnic fellows.<br>

		<p>There is actually more of Zorastrianism in Christianity than there is Judaism in Christianity.  Jesus and his followers were Jews, but after about 100 AD Christianity veered very far from Judiasm.</p>
<p>Most theologians consider Zoraster to be a pre Christian prophet.</p>

		<p>Anonymous@5:31 PM, your Hindu scholar is wrong. The Muslims who conquered India were mostly not Arabs. The founding stock of the Mughal empire were a mix of Iranian and Turkic peoples from Afghanistan, and the same peoples invaded India earlier, e.g. as the Ghaznawid empire and the Timur invasion. Iran itself did the last Muslim invasion of India in 1739 under Nader shah, but that did not stick.</p>
<p>Historical minutiae aside, it seems that Iranians and Turks are the advanced and naturally dominant nations in that region. We might not like their politics or their religion, but we should not underestimate them any more than we should underestimate the Chinese. Just because they are not particularly creative and have borrowed our shiny toys heavily does not stop them from eventually learning to do a good job at using them.</p>

		<p> #11 you are wrong about the Phoenecians sharing more with Greeks than the Semites. The main ancient Semetic languages were Phoenician, Punic, Moabite, Aramaic, Edomite, Hebrew and Ammonite. Initially all these were written in Phoenician script. These are all obviously Semitic not Indo-European languages. Which were Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, German and a host of Slavic and Baltic and Celtic languages. In fact, Jesus spoke Aramaic.</p>
<p>As far as Iranians being European/Aryan that is absurd. That is like saying Mexicans are Europeans because they speak Spanish. All modern Iranians are is what Americans will be in 2000 years from now if present trends persist. We will be almost totally non-White but our long ago ancestors will have been White.  Travel is the key. I have been to Iran one look at the people and their civilization tells you it is another Third World dump. Israel conversely has far greater White tendencies both in their much higher level of civilization and by the look of the people.<br>
My relatives are from Scotland when I used to visit them in the 70&rsquo;s in Glasgow. T was very poor. Yet the civilization was clearly European in it&rsquo;s structure. If you travel, it is the best racial education one can get.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t know if I think of Iranians as quite equal, but they&rsquo;re most certainly an old, sophisticated civilization with healthy self-respect. After being kicked around by Arabs and Turks for a while, they got serious about their national interest too, but after having regained their sovereignty and eventually given Ottomans a bunch of bloody noses (including wiping out just about every Sunni in Baghdad once), they kind of forgot. Well, they were pretty soon kicked around by British, Russians and in the end Americans as well. The last shah wasn&rsquo;t too bad of a ruler, but which kind of proud civilization can really live under a client dictator of foreign power?</p>
<p>Too bad they ended up with that dirtbag Islamist government. Talk about one step forward, two steps back. Still, if they can get rid of that or neuter the Guardian Council like lots of Europeans neutered their monarchs, I think they&rsquo;ll do well. Quite possibly I wouldn&rsquo;t soon look down on them at all, like I don&rsquo;t on East Asians (hell, in some respects I think they&rsquo;re somewhat superior). Might not be to our best interests, but meh, that&rsquo;s not really what it&rsquo;s about and they have no intrinsic reason to care about it anyway. As it is, sophisticated and well-ordered civilizations using violence in controlled doses can usually deal with each other. With savage tribes and semi-civilized states it&rsquo;s always so damned messy.</p>

Henry white europeans and americans need to stop calling themselves aryans. The word Iran refers to land of the aryans. The ancient aryans occupied India and Iran. There is no historical literature or oral tradition native to Europe that describes europeans as aryans. The word is only native to India and Iran(Persia).</p>

		<p>Caleo is correct. The Aryan migration into Europe occurred roughly 6000 years ago. However, DNA tests show that modern European genetics is more than 85% similar to what it was during the Ice Age (12000 years ago). This means that Aryan migration had at most 15% contribution to European DNA, and this does not even count all the other migrations into Europe (Turkic, Berber, etc.) throughout history. The real Aryan contribution to European DNA is more likely to be around 5%, if that.</p>
<p>Aryan does not equal European.</p>

		<p>All this discussion as to whether or not Persians are white will never reach a conclusion because there is no definition of &#8220;white&#8221;. The Iranians are caucasoid, so are Indians, Turks, Arabs, Berbers and, indeed Europeans. Perhaps the word &#8220;white&#8221;, if it has to be used, should be confined to Europeans.</p>
<p>I have known several Iranians and on first seeing them take them for Italians, a mistake not helped by the fact that their surnames sometimes sound Italian. So, if they are not actually white, they are pretty close.</p>

		<p>Amusing bluster from the Persians as they continue to be fanatical followers of the faith imposed on them at scimitar-point by the Arabs.  If Persians decide to revert to Zoroastrianism or move on to the Bah&rsquo;ai faith, both being authentic native Persian religions, I&rsquo;d be more impressed by the big talk.   Instead they continue to meekly submit to an Arab supremacist religion.</p>

But, HELLO, they have been breeding with people who do, at least some. And my point in that whole post, is, dark skin, coarse, kinky hair, brown eyes and LOW INTELLIGENCE tend to win in the mixture of races. <br>
It sucks, too!<br>
So whites had better not go the way of ancient Greeks, and (Let&rsquo;s not argue trifling specifics) most other once- whiter groups around the Med.</p>
<p>As to the Phonecians (sp), they were NOT ARAB. That was my point. They were swamped by Arabs, and Arab ways, and brought into the misery they now suffer as a result!<br>
That is a plain historical fact. <br>
Read up on Phonecian (sp) history. They were absolutely kick-ass people, when Arabs were in the stoneage.<br>
And You can still find a few Lebanese who are indistinguishable fro Europeans. Light skin, light hair, blue eyes. They look French. Some are, of course, duh! But that white blood has been around a long time there. <br>

		<p>The Persian civilization is one of the oldest and most refined in the world. The literature, architecture, poetry, cuisine, and art (especially carpets), are among the finest. Persian women are perhaps the most feminine and beautiful, and Persian men are among the most masculine and handsome of all peoples. I lived in Iran for three years and it was my experience that Persian culture far surpasses that of the US in every way. I&rsquo;m German and have light olive skin and brown eyes. The Iranian I married has paler skin and green eyes. Incidentally, Germans are the preferred foreign wives in Iran because they are considered to be pure Aryan. American women are regarded as mongrels.</p>

<p>No. Your point was to describe an ethnic group about whom you obviously knew v. little as partially black when they are not, with a few exceptions in the southern part of the country. A Persian told me there is a black group descended from slaves in a certain part of Iran, but they are not a significant demographic. As far as typical Persian looks, they tend to have olive skin and v. dark hair &amp; eyes, but lighter coloring is not extremely rare, esp. in the northern areas; when they&rsquo;ve been in the sun a while they can get quite brown, but are not naturally what I call a &#8220;solid brown&#8221; color. &#8220;Solid brown&#8221; in the way that most Indians (not all), for example. They just don&rsquo;t strike me as a brown people; just darker than white Euros on the average. Their eyebrows are rather intensely dark and heavy and that gives them a distinctive &#8220;middle eastern&#8221; look. One lady said she can always tell Iranians because they have a &#8220;twinkle&#8221; in the eyes. They do have more of a sense of humor than Arabs, but they haven&rsquo;t had a chance to exercise that facility much with Americans in the last 30 yrs. As they get older and their hair get less intense, they look less &#8220;middle eastern.&#8221; Sometimes older Persians didn&rsquo;t look Persian at all to me. Their features  are European type features basically, though they are a distinctive ethnicity.</p>
<p>They have called themselves &#8220;Aryan&#8221; for many centuries. The Nazis took the term from a language group  &mdash;  the Aryan family of languages. The idea of Aryan as blond/blue was overlain on the cultural identity. It was not a part of the ancient meaning. Aryanism had been a focus of study among Orientalists since the mid-1800s, with the French being the most active and since the mid-1800s, Europeans, esp. French, had gone to Persia in search of the history of the Aryan language; race was often intertwined in their writings on the subject.<br>
When i was a kid, Life Magazine ran pictures of the coronation of the Shah &amp; pictures of his family and court. I was fascinated because they looked so much like <br>
&#8220;us&#8221; (whites)  &mdash;   a bit different but not greatly so   &mdash;   and yet were in this exotic, non-European country. So when people describe them as you have, I know they do not know much about them. </p>

<p>Obviously you do not know where the Persians obtained their slaves.  You must have attended an American public school where you were told the false information that the only people in the world who were ever enslaved were black africans.</p>
<p>Why do you keep posting about Persia and Persians when it is obvious that you know nothing at all about them or the country?</p>
<p>Could you even identify Persia on a blank map of the world? Do you know what countries border Persia?  I doubt it. </p>
<p>The most ignorant of your latest statement is that Persians have been breeding with very dark people with low intelligence.  I assume you mean black african slaves.</p>
<p>Read some history.  Persians imported millions of slaves.  Very few to none were black africans who were simply too far away.  If you look at a map you might notice that.</p>
<p>Persians imported their slaves from what is now Russia, crimea, Circassia, caucasia, Georgia and  Ukraine.  If you ever looked at a map of the world you might notice that one of the longest north south rivers on earth, the Volga, goes from N Russia to the Caspain sea.  Russia is on the north side of the Caspain sea, Persia on the south side.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked at a map of the world?  Ever heard of the Caspian sea or the Volga, Dniepier or Don rivers through which were shipped millions of slavic slaves to Persia and Turkey by way of the black and Caspian seas  over the centuries?</p>
<p>The Persians bought their slavic and S Russian slaves from the slavers who went up and down the Volga,capturing them and shipping them  across the Caspian sea to Persia.</p>
<p>This went on for thousands of years. What with  extreme Shiism and crime in Russia it might have been revived since the revolution.  Ever heard of Shiism?  Bet you haven&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The Persians have been breeding with those Russian slaves for centuries. There are a lot of kurds in Persia.  They are a separatist group.  They tend to have brown hair and fairer skin that many Persians.  There is an Arab section of Persia.  They look standard Arab tan skin black hair.</p>
<p>One distinctive feature of many Persians are very shining big black not brown eyes. </p>
<p>I think you have confused Persians with the Morrocans and Egyptians who have bred with their black african slaves so much that many of them look much more black african than Arab.</p>
<p>Look at a map.  There are millions of Persians in this country.  You could probably find a Church or mosque or club.  The Persian Christians are called Chaldean Catholics.  There are also Zorastrian and Baahi Persian temples in the US. The Persian mosques are separate from the Sunni mosques.</p>
<p>Find a Persian and look at him or her.  Or are you one of those who think that only blue eyed Whites are truly White?</p>
<p>There is not a lot of hope for White nationalism when White nationalists reject every White whose ethnic homelands are south of Paris and east of Vienna.  </p>

<p>For those who keep claiming against the writings of Herodutus, the ancient Egyptians, the ancient Persians themselves and a vast amount of anthropology and other evidence over the centuries that Persians are &#8220;mediterranean&#8221; here is where the medes and persians came from.  Caucasus which is in Southern Russia.</p>
<p>Persian Period in Anatolia and Asia Minor<br>
Medes and Persians who, in the 13th C. BCE, entered Northwest Persia via Caucasus were of Indo-European origin. Medes settled first in the Ecbatana <br>
region www.ancientanatolia.com/historical/persian_period.htm </p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is that most Iranians, on average, racially resemble people from Southern Europe.&#8221; Sardonicus</p>
<p>But they are not from S. Europe, they originated in S. Russia.<br>
This was covered in my freshman high school year, verified by every historian who ever wrote about Persia for the last 5, 000 years.</p>
<p>If you work at a university surely you have access to the library. </p>
<p>Is someone posted an article about the wars in <br>
Afghanistan, Libya, and Iraq some one would immediately post that<br>
Arabs are not Europeans as though that is some major discovery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surrounded by Persians.  I know what they look like, the full range of White brunette types.  But I don&rsquo;t assume there of Mediterrean origin because of their dark brown and black hair.</p>
<p>Sorry if I seem agressive and arrogant about this, but if White Nationalists confine themselves to blue eyed Whites from a small section of N. West Europe,we are doomed, especially in America.<br>
