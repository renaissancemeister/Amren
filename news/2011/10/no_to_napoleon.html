		<p>That&rsquo;s not only Napoleon, but also Fran√ßois the First, Henri the IVth, and Louis the XIVth. They too were almost removed from schoolbooks. Clovis, Charlemagne and Joan of Arc were already withdrawn before.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if the USA take out from their history books Washington, Jefferson Davis, James Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, and David Crockett. What is left then? Children know only of great Americans such as Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Nat Turner, Martin Luther King, Al Capone and above them all Nelson Mandela.</p>

<p>At 1:04, look in the background. Nice white French girl reading book, African a bench down waiting to pounce.</p>
<p>At around 2:40, man says &#8220;We have to learn about even our worst days.&#8221; Guess what, my friend, they are just around the corner.</p>
<p>At 2:52, at least we get to see what a class full of white students looks like. If you are from anywhere within a thirty mile radius of Chicago and don&rsquo;t pay $40K a year for ultra private tuition you&rsquo;ve never seen something like that before.</p>

<p>The narrator uses the phrase &#8220;Political Correctness gone mad.&#8221; That phrase has been sticking out at me lately   &mdash;   not because I hear it so much (although as an AR reader of course I do) but because it&rsquo;s redundant. The &#8220;gone mad&#8221; part, I mean. Political Correctness, even in it&rsquo;s &#8220;milder&#8221; forms, is mad to begin with. &#8220;PC gone mad&#8221; seems to presume there&rsquo;s some SANE version of PC. There isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s ALL craziness. Dictating other people&rsquo;s speech to avoid offending certain other people who aren&rsquo;t even in the room at the time, does not stand up to any sort of logic test. </p>
<p>That said, the new French history curriculum is crazier than most. Twenty pages on foreign slavery and only SIX on their own heroic Gen. Bonaparte is madness. A special brand of madness found only in nations actively devoted to their own demise. </p>

<p>All those white kids is exactly the point: they&rsquo;re to be indoctrinated.  Black and other minority kids don&rsquo;t need to be because they are raised hating whites, right within their own households, well before they reach school age.  After that, the whites are made to catch up and pretty soon, everyone hates whites.  That&rsquo;s the goal.  Way back in the 1980&rsquo;s when I was in high school I noticed the newly rewritten textbooks&rsquo; exclusions and outright lies and fought openly with my history and government teachers, which got me in the principal&rsquo;s office.  I made my argument with the principal and the textbooks were actually augmented with handouts containing HISTORICAL TRUTH and I made A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s for the rest of my time in h.s.  My government teacher had threatened to fail me but when I stood up for my right to speak the truth, she was made to back down.  I guess I got lucky.  It will be interesting to see if anyone in France does what I did.  I doubt it.</p>

		<p>In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, I had some contact with English, French, and Swedish citizens. Their attitudes seemed to be that the few third-worlders living in their countries, absorbed European values and customs, or returned to their homelands. They also considered the black-white racial conflict to be a result of American ignorance and foolishness. It&rsquo;s simple they maintained: society should set up reasonable rules and apply them equally to all citizens. European condescension toward Americans was obvious.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, we know what has happened to the US, and it seems that even more is happening to the Europeans.  </p>

<p>The French revolution and the part Napoleon played in it were crucial to forming the world we live in. The enlightenment paved the way for the free thinking minds of today. Now great minds are censored to the point of absurdity unless they are deemed politically correct. James watson for starters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just hard for liberals to accept the fact that Africa has contributed nothing but raw resources to the technologically advanced society we live in today. Where are all the great minds coming out of Africa? I&rsquo;d like to know. Oh thats right there killing one another in civil wars and fighting over U.S. food aid.</p>

<p>The little girl is holding a Polish textbook so it is not a French classroom. In Paris, you have to move 20 km from the city limits to find all-White classrooms in public schools. And even there that is not always the case. Catholic private schools are much cheaper, though, but they are usually so crowded nowadays that they refuse many children.</p>
<p>Americans imagine that Paris is still a French town because they visit only the cosy arrondissements in the center. They also fail to realize that many of the Whites they see around are not Parisians but foreign tourists like themselves or French travelers from other regions. They don&rsquo;t know that heavy police presence at metro and train hubs in the northern surrounding towns prevent Black and Arab teens from entering the network. But just two kilometers northwards, it resembles Mauritania and quite often Subsaharan Africa. Paris is essentially non-White at night, and unsafe to White women. Actually, it&rsquo;s Chicago!</p>

		<p>Well, this has been going on for several decades to American textbooks &#8220;across the curriculum.&#8221;  </p>
<p>For example,  Larry Schweikart writes in <i>48 Liberal Lies about American History That You Probably Learned in School:</i></p>
<p><i>In a survey of the ten most widely used American history textbooks, one of the most frequently used images depicting life in the 1920s is that of the&hellip;K.  Virtually all of these textbooks dedicate at least one page, often more, to the K in the 20th century.  According to these texts, the K, above all other groups, defined America. This over the top coverage, meant to characterize the 1920s as an age of bigotry and backwardness, is common among almost all textbooks</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in California, ever on the forefront of the culture wars, textbooks are not only being &#8220;revised&#8221; and rewritten to show America as a racist, sexist and imperialist but&hellip;</p>
<p><i>Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill into law to ensure California K-12 school children know about gay historical figures.  The Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful (FAIR) Education Act makes California the first state to mandate that students study &#8216;the role and contributions of &hellip; gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans &hellip; to the development of California and the United States.&rsquo;</i> </p>
<p><i>Randy Thomasson of Save California says the new law means that public school children will be taught to admire homosexuality, same-sex marriages, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and even sex change operations. Kids will also be taught to support LGBT political activism because of the law&rsquo;s emphasis on &#8216;portraying the role of these groups in contemporary society.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>Parents will not be notified, nor will they be able to exempt their children, because the alternative lifestyle lessons will be part of the core curriculum.</i></p>
<p>Do you need a better reason to yank your kids out of government indoctrination centers?  What are you waiting for?  Do it NOW and don&rsquo;t look back!</p>

		<p>  What happened to the idea of educating youth in the glories of French culture?  What happened to the great French authors like Balzac, Zola, Moliere, and Camus? What became of the great French artists like David, Monet, Manet, Degas and Gauguin?  Where are the great Musicians of France: Berlioz, Gounod, Debussy, Ravel, and Couperin? They have been replaced by a rabble of insignificant Africans, Arabs and Asians in taxpayer supported textbooks.  &ldquo;Those who the Gods destroy they first drive insane&rdquo; Euripides.

<p>You are quite right. Use of the phrase &#8220;Political Correctness gone mad&#8221; serves only to legitimise the concept of PC itself. PC is a manifestation of Cultural Marxism, intellectual tyranny. Every use of the phrase reinforces our mental straightjackets.</p>
<p>The phrase could not have become so widespread without a concerted effort to bring it into public discourse by those who &#8220;mediate&#8221;. Every hearing of the phrase should be a reminder of which group controls the media, and how they are using that control to help slowly kill off our people.</p>

		<p>Sardonicus, et al:  I think that part of France&rsquo;s mad political correctness comes from outright fear.  Does anyone remember the Paris riots from a couple of years ago?  It was yet another instance of Muslims overrunning a European country demanding jobs and housing, then burning cars and shops.  Native Parisians can be rightly afraid or loathing of Africans of all colors, but especially the North African Muslims because they are so completely carefree about being violent.  Perhaps, even if subconsciously, the authors of these new histories are trying to placate the invaders out of fear.  </p>
<p>Know, however, that this is just one theory.  Still, think about why so many Americans placate blacks.  Fear. </p>

<p>Fraser&rsquo;s &#8216;The WASP Question&rsquo; clearly notes this.<br>
It was the West&rsquo;s adoption of scholasticism divorced from God and the conciliar Church, (instead of the Autocratic Papacy) that led to the Enligthenment. Of course, serious minds would go back to the Schism of 1054, and the filioque, but that&rsquo;s for another day&hellip;..</p>

I thought the French would be too arrogant to fall for this, but I seem to be wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an American proud of my French ancestry, which traces back to the 11th century noble lines, I must put in that you two are making huge errors in praising Napoleon or the French Revolution as great and positive people and events in European history.</p>
<p>First, Napoleon in fact, was Italian.  Next, the French Revolution was a tragedy that was sparked by national poverty that a result of Louis XVl financial support of the American Revolution.  The hatred for example of Marie Antoinette was due to fraudulent claims of excess and especially one particular fraud concerning the purchase of some expensive jewelry at the height of national crisis.  The French Reign of Terror saw legions of innocents, witch hunting, etc., to go wild.  Europe was frightened to death that the whole thing would spread.  Napoleon seized power of the military and brought some order, then fed the people the notion of national greatness through warring on its neighbors.  Fifteen years of devastating wars ravaged Europe.  While some civic organization was achieved far more destruction resulted, not to mention hundreds of thousands of deaths of Europeans at the hands of Europeans, many civilians.  By the time of Waterloo, Napoleon had to conscript the last of France&rsquo;s young men.  France&rsquo;s genetic makeup was permanently changed by the Napoleonic Wars.  And also important to realize is that the bitterments formed by the Napoleonic Wars led directly to the confrontation with Germany in The Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and so to both World Wars, which Europe has never really recovered from, especially spiritually and demographically.  Further, The French Revolution set into motion later Marxist revolutions, which occurred all over Continental Europe, especially within the Hapsburg Empire, leading up to the Big One which has further harmed the White World.</p>
<p>As for Bridgette Bardot, aside from being a one time sex goddess, she has made her marks as a representative for animal rights, and that only coincidentally made her an opponent of Islam in France.</p>
<p>As for the French being arrogant, my experience there is that they are actually very sweet people.  But they have had to put up with foreigners walking all over their country ARROGANTLY for eons.  Certainly, they have had to put up with outrages beyond belief.  A good review of the history of slavery in Europe would note how the French Gauls were subjugated and enslaved by Romans, and later captured and sold in the Arab markets in Africa.  All education is good, but the problem is the Marxist aim of deconstructing the national feeling by hammering the young French minds into a One World political consciousness.  Of course, this has been happening in the U.S. for nearly 4 decades. </p>
<p>While living in Europe, I found everyone pretty much as arrogant as most Americans, just perhaps in different ways and also perhaps with better reason.  France is arguably the most desirable span of land in Europe; it&rsquo;s beauty is truly remarkable.  The French culture is envied and imitated world over.  The French have a difficult task in the fight to preserve itself, since it has lost so much already.  But either case of distorting the truth of history is not serving such ends.  Better it is to face it all, the good and bad, and see the outcomes as they truly are, remarking and teaching of the tenacity of the French to survive and still remain great despite the worst.  National direction to French cultural and genetic survival is best served this way.</p>

		<p>This ones not about race.Napoleon&rsquo;s being written out because hes coming back.Napoleon was pushing for a unified liberal Europe of nation states, overthrowing the Divine Right monarchs and lords. Him and Hitler are seen as the ugly side of the never ending dream of a unified Europe. Its coming back round, Napoleon and the wars he sparked need to be forgotten to pave the way for the E.U super state. Hitler will become their bogeyman, but anyone else needs to be rewritten or forgotten. The muslims and &#8220;Europistan&#8221; situation is a fantasy. They have no real power and are just labour and votes to be used by progressive forces,undermine Democracy maybe a good excuse for a foreign invasion as well. Brussels is going for the Economic conquest model, which will soon break down and be revealed for what it is.

		<p>As a former French professor at the university level, I find this sort of &#8220;purification&#8221; (√©puration) of French history texts to be particulary troublesome.  As Voltaire once stated, &#8220;History is nothing but a pack of tricks that the living play on the dead.&#8221; This still rings true today. As the French struggle to preserve their race-blind, republican-based society, the immigrants masses (primarily Muslim) that come from North Africa and other former colonies are becoming more aggressive in their demands for recognition and ethnic equality in all facets of society.  France&rsquo;s cultural greatness is now fading into the morass of Europeanism; it will soon become a historical artifact if something proactive isn&rsquo;t done.  This parallels, in many ways, our struggle to preserve white identity in a country that is being rapidly transformed by multiculturalism advocates who are recasting history and demonizing the extraordinary men who founded our nation.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;First,Napoleon in fact,was Italian&rdquo;</p>
<p>Um,no!Napoleon was Corsican.<br>
____________________________</p>
<p><br>
Get your facts straight!</p>
<p>Are you suggesting that Corsicans are not  (really) Italians?</p>
<p>They are &#8220;French&#8221; only by virtue of a piece of paper. Many of them today are hostile to French authority and don&rsquo;t want to be French.  LIke the Basques, there is a strong independence movement. </p>
<p>Anyway, Corsica was a possession of Genoa at the time, which was purchased by France. Napoleon&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s family was actually of Tuscan descent.  Tuscany is in Italy.  So he was Italian.</p>
<p>Napoleon was said always to have spoken French with a slight accent;  and his writing and grammar in French were not very good. </p>
<p>Like a great many of the rulers and powerful in France, he was of non-French origin (Maria di Medici, Cardinal Mazarin, Kleber, Massena, MacMahon, etc.)  Immigration into France was strong to replace the declining French even two hundred years ago.  For two hundred years the French have not reproduced their numbers. But these immigrants were European and fit in imperceptibly.  However tolerance for immigrants set the stage for Third World immigration that began at the end of the 20th Century. By that time, France had been softened up to immigrants from everywhere and to the notion that immigration is good. </p>
<p>As #20 (accurately) said,  &#8220;they have had to put up with foreigners walking all over their country ARROGANTLY for eons.<br>
Napoleon seized power and  fed the people the notion of national greatness through warring on their neighbors.  Fifteen years of devastating wars ravaged Europe&hellip;not to mention hundreds of thousands of deaths of civilians.  By the time of Waterloo,<br>
Napoleon had to conscript the last of France&rsquo;s young men. <i><b>France&rsquo;s genetic makeup was permanently changed by the Napoleonic Wars.</b>  </i> And  the embitterments formed by the Napoleonic Wars led directly to the confrontation with Germany in The Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and so to both World Wars, from  which Europe has never fully recoverd - spiritually or demographically. Further, The French Revolution set into motion later Marxist revolutions all over Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p><br>
Napoleon became a French citizen by an accident of only a few days. The treaty handing over Corsica to France had been signed just before Napoleon&rsquo;s birth. Otherwise, he would have been born Genoese. </p>
<p>As a gesture of good will and to win over loyalty of the population, promising young Corsicans were sent to France for free education at royal expense. Napoleon was one of those selected.</p>
<p>As an adult, Napoleon was rather contemptuous of Italians, and  looked down on them, despite his own ancestry.  He resented any references to it.  He invaded Italy many times and treated Italy with a harsh hand.  But he was equally contemptuous of any notion of nationality being linked to blood. He was one of those who most ardently insisted that ANYONE could be French. Hence, the destruction of any concept of &#8220;Frenchness&#8221;, or of French national identify. You could say he was one of the first internationalists. To him, being French was a matter of a piece of paper. And so it has been ever since. </p>
<p>It recalls to me a famous quote. In a conversation with an Italian countess, on one of his Italian campaigns, Napoleon made the scornful comment that,  &#8220;All Italians are crooks and scoundrels&#8221;.  With great diplomacy, the witty countess replied:  &#8220;Non tutti.  Ma buona parte, si.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Not all. But Bonaparte, yes.]</p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>I always viewed Napoleon as a nationalist. He wanted to bring back the glory of the French and their culture/history. His disdain of the previous Bourbon Monarchy (except for a few) led him to try to recreate glory an earlier French golden age (even after a revolution that was initially caused to create a democratic republic found in newly formed USA).</p>
<p>In fact he made himself a dictator by specifically reinstating a monarchy (which &#8220;rule by blood/ancestry&#8221;). Sure it is a personal level, but it does lead credence to a biological entitlement in which his decedents are entitled to privileged of kingship  (going as far as to call himself emperor).</p>
<p>Internationalist literally means beyond nations (something found in Marxism under the Soviet or European Union). Instead everywhere he went he imposed French Imperialism.</p>
<p>It is interesting hearing your point of view though, GHW.</p>

<p><br>
Nationalism did not even exist before the age of Napoleon. It was unknown.  In fact, it began in Germany as a reaction to Napoleon&rsquo;s imperialism.</p>
<p>Being a nationalist means defense of your own nation and culture. It does not mean trying to impose one&rsquo;s rule   &mdash;    one&rsquo;s law, language and culture   &mdash;   upon everyone else. Napoleon was an imperialist without any pretense.  Yes, and he was totally devoted to France, his adopted country. </p>
<p>Btw,  to give balance, there are many things about Napoleon that I admire.  He dragged much of Europe, kicking and screaming,  out of the Middle Ages and into the modern world. He founded schools and technical institutes;  he encouraged the advancement of science; he reformed the laws and the chaotic legal system (the Napoleonic Code);  he emancipated the Jews from their ghettos;  he built roads; he promoted commerce; he rebuilt and beautified Paris; he re-drew the entire map of Europe and made it more rational.  </p>
<p>But he was also a despot who brooked no resistance. He chose as his royal emblem the bee, a creature which never stops working. Neither did he.  Once thing must be said about Napoleon: he got things done!</p>
