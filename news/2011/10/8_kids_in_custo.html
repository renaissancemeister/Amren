<h1><a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44958677/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/#.TqBbrpua9tO">8 Kids in Custody in Philly Basement Abuse Case</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, October 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Eight children and teens linked to the accused Philadelphia basement captors were in protective custody on Wednesday, including a teen so badly abused that &#8220;it makes you want to cry,&#8221; the city&rsquo;s police commissioner said.</p>
<p>Four accused captors are charged with kidnapping four mentally handicapped adults, each with the capacity of a 10-year-old child, found in a basement dungeon in what authorities said was a scheme to steal their Social Security disability checks.</p>
<p>The four adults were discovered malnourished and imprisoned in the filthy basement room over the weekend. One was chained to a furnace. Authorities said two of those held had been captive for roughly 11 years.</p>
<p>Police said they also had eight children and teens in protective custody, the youngest a 2-year-old, and were working to determine the nature of their relationships with both the suspects and captives.</p>
<p>One of the teens, Beatrice Weston, 19, is a niece of suspect Linda Ann Weston and had been beaten and tortured, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said. She had been reported missing in 2009.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter said he was not certain the word &#8220;horrific&#8221; was adequate to describe the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is sheer madness,&#8221; Nutter told a news conference, adding the case was an &#8220;incredibly tangled web of horror.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 30 years ago, Weston was convicted of starving to death a 25-year-old man in her apartment in North Philadelphia and served eight years in prison, authorities said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say there may be as many as 50 victims in multiple states in the case.</p>
<p>The case could be among the first of its kind prosecuted as a federal hate crime, according to a law-enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss the case publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The 2009 Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act is named for two victims of notorious hate-based killings and expands earlier federal hate crimes law to include sexual orientation or disability, among other things.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Weston was legally disqualified from cashing the victims&rsquo; government disability checks because of her criminal past.</p>
<p>But she apparently did anyway, enabled in part by a lack of accountability and follow-through by government agencies and police.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Well, when I first read the intro on another home page today, my thought was - - I know who has done this. And I was correct. Malevolently evil mentality and you know who is to blame. Horrific is a mild term as Nutter has said. And let us not hope the usual team of culprits do not try to &#8220;understand&#8221; any of this. This was just plain evil.</p>

		<p>The videos with the story are interesting. One thing I do not understand, some of these people were reported &#8220;missing&#8221; for years, including a minor. How could they be &#8220;missing persons&#8221; if someone was cashing their SSI checks? If the families searched for them and they were mentally disabled surely they would realize someone was still cashing the checks!</p>

		<p>&#8220;The 2009 Matthew Shepard &#8220;</p>
<p>The people who killed Matthew Shephard were gay or bisexual themselves.  The killing had nothing to do with sex.  Matthew was a small time retail drug dealer at his college.</p>
<p>The killers were wholesalers.  They gave Matthew drugs on commission. He did not turn the money over to them. Matthew and the murderers had an on going problem with this. It was not the first time the wholesalers thought Matthew was cheating them.</p>
<p>The gay issue did not come up until the defense came up with the brilliant idea that Matthew had sexual harassed the murderer.  The murderer only defended himself from possible rape or lesser sexualt assault.</p>
<p>That sure backfired.</p>
<p>That hate crime law is just one illustration of how powerful the ADL SPLC is.  With their total control of media and law enforcement, they managed to hide the truth.  It was never even reported that the murderers were drug dealers. It was just that they were evil White male Christian typical G who went out  and killed a gay man for the fun of it.</p>
<p>The whole thing is an astounding cover up and myth creation.</p>
<p>Shows what Whites are up against and how strong are the anti White forces.</p>
<p>If the victims here were White I doubt the black Philly police and social workers would do anything.  <br>

<p>Well it would be racist to question a black woman for cashing the SS check of another would it not?  </p>
<p>And besides&hellip; she spent all that money back into the economy buy buying gasoline, getting her nails polished and eating out at Chinese restaurants&hellip; so what was the harm?</p>
