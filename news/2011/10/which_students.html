<h1><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272775711000100">Which Students Are Left Behind? The Racial Impacts of the No Child Left Behind Act</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John M. Krieg, Science Direct, August 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The No Child Left Behind Act imposes sanctions on schools if the fraction of any of five racial groups of students demonstrating proficiency on a high stakes exam falls below a statewide pass rate. This system places pressure on school administrators to redirect educational resources from groups of students likely to demonstrate proficiency towards those who are marginally below proficient. Using statewide observations of 3rd and 4th grade math tests, this paper demonstrates that students of successful racial groups at schools likely to be sanctioned gain less academically over their subsequent test year than comparable peers at passing schools. This effect is stronger at schools more likely to suffer from NCLB sanctions and is robust to corrections for non-random sample selection.</p>

		<p>No Child Left Behind is really No Child Gets Ahead.  It&rsquo;s like I said earlier today in yesterday&rsquo;s Detroit post, paraphrasing Paul Kersey, the opportunity cost of NCLB, the education that white children aren&rsquo;t receiving in order &#8220;not to leave black and Hispanic children behind,&#8221; is far more drastic than the on-budget line item cost of NCLB.</p>

		<p>Blacks learn best in highly structured, heavy discipline, military style unpleasantness.  Not that some white kids couldn&rsquo;t use some discipline, but most seem capable of learning with little interference from a teacher nor intrusive &#8220;socialization and control&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>Regardless, of course our stupid, chimeric, quixotic, quest for vindication of the stupitopian left&rsquo;s pipe dream of racial equality has resulted in harming white children.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what all affirmative action is really about anyway - hurting whites so much we all live like blacks.  Ah, equality!</p>

The more we hurt, the more our enemies can celebrate &#8220;ridding the world of structural racism through eliminating racist unearned White privilege.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s us they are talking about.  We are the only legitimate target for racial hatred and violence on the planet.</p>

 The intelligent children are ignored in order to raise the scores of the less intelligent. this is the reason behind the constant lowering of standards; to bring it down to the lowest common denominator.</p>

		<p>If I were  teacher in a California school and I were dismissed because the black or brown students didnt get good eniugh grades,I wouldnt be upset, because I could then get transferred to a school that had more whites or asians. California is really hurting for teachers willing to put up with black and brown deliquents, and they want as many of them they can get.I dont know about other states.</p>

		<p>The inverted logic of liberals. Everyone knows young white men created most of civilization so this is a reason to skimp on their educations and lavish money on groups which have never accomplished anything. But then, I don&rsquo;t think libs actually want any more progress. They would prefer if things like the car and chemistry had never been invented.</p>

		<p>If I can decipher this goobly gook it seems to be saying that children in &#8220;successful racial groups&#8221; i.e. whites/asians in &#8220;schools likely to be sanctioned&#8221; i.e. heavily black schools learn less than whites/asians at non black schools.</p>

		<p>Of course. NCLB was designed to produce MEDIOCRITY - meaning get rid of the super low and the super high kids, and advance the Golden Mean, which of necessity results in mediocrity.  As a former teacher, I witnessed this first hand.</p>
<p>Just FYI, I moments ago saw on &#8220;Hannity&#8221; (Fox News Channel) a man who wrote a book on the Obama justice (??) department, and he uses the word &#8220;RACIALIST.&#8221;  He said it means one who uses race to get a specific goal accomplished.  I was astonished to hear that term - I first encountered it on AmRen, and I believe it&rsquo;s apt here.  We might want to listen up for this on other sites though!</p>

		<p>I am a teacher at a predominantly Asian school and my job is like a dream come true- highly motivated and intelligent students who get upset if they get an A- and break down into tears apologizing when they forget to bring their homework. Even white students are not this good. </p>
<p>The success of Asian children makes liberals extremely uncomfortable because it interferes with their notion that low Black achievement is caused by a culturally biased curriculum designed by whites in order to &#8216;oppress&rsquo; minorities.</p>
<p>I invite all you liberals to go observe a classroom dominated by Asians. They put the white kids to shame! Today&rsquo;s white kids are NOT violent or aggressive like certain groups but they tend to text in class and spend too much time playing with social media at home while the Asian kids study the maths and sciences. </p>

<p>Culturally biased curriculum and institutional racism? That&rsquo;s the bizarre, emperor has no clothes, we&rsquo;re in the twilight zone, aspect of it all. The curriculum is biased against whites as are the institutions. You can have one, institutional racism against whites, i.e. affirmative action, or in it&rsquo;s place you can claim institutions favor whites. But you can&rsquo;t have both. If you do AmRen is going to say something about it!</p>

		<p>My Slavic ancestors found out that Asians where their future alright during the late Middle Ages, as in millions dead, cities razed to the ground such as Kiev and the populace being ruled by ethnic aliens that exploited them. Eventually my Russian ancestors violently overthrew them and drove them out, those who didn&rsquo;t get beheaded by Russian swords that is. Asians have not changed when it comes to their core beliefs and character since Ghengis and Kublai Kahn, whose names is synomyous in the minds of Russians with death and destruction. Want proof? Just look at how the Chinese and Japanese have acted during the past century for a clue. Be careful what you wish for Jennifer, you might get it and the rest of us along with you.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see, I graduated from college in 1981 at the age of 38. Obviously, I started college rather late in life. Anyway, I was a science major, but had to take electives in other disciplines. One of the electives I took was philosophy and I was really looking forward to it. The first day of class the professor announced that the textbook he had chosen was because most college students were reading at an 8th grade level. He was a good professor, but I guess he had to make do with what he had. Almost half the class failed the mid-term which was easy enough if you just showed up, listened, and did the reading assignments. </p>
<p>So, this nonsense has been going on for a long time and it looks like it&rsquo;s only getting worse. I feel sorry for the professors who have to put up with this, it must be very discouraging. By the way, this was at City College in New York after they implemented open admissions. </p>
<p>I guess open admissions means that you can be dumb as a brick but, by God, you WILL go to college!     </p>

		<p>This country is in transition.  Unfortunately, this country wasted 50 + years and continuing due to dumbing down of the educational system and affirmative action trying to close the achievement gap between whites and blacks and soon to another huge upcoming Hispanic underclass.  Those years were critical in preparing for this country to go to the next level of creating jobs.  Many forward looking authorities and educators warned of the foolishness but this country decided to wear the badge of not appearing racists instead which it continues to this date.   No government bailouts or stimulus can adequately solve the problems this country is facing.  It will take years or ever to get this country back on its feet.  When the whites increasing become the minority, this country is finished.  It will regress to the level of the ever increasing third world population countries of origin.  The whites need to stay at a critical mass of over 60% for this country to survive.   </p>

		<p>@12 Jenifer,</p>
<p>The high IQ of East Asians has been observerved in psychometric tests for a long time.  However I think there are two other factors: Firstly Asian immigration is elite immigration since to gain residency access to western nations standards need to be met which filter out the less intelligent and capable. Unlike Hispanics Asians can not easily avail themselves of illegal immigration. Secondly there is the tendancy of migrants and their children to work hard to make their immigration succesfull.  I would suspect White European immigrants would also tend to be slight over achievers.</p>
<p>The immigration process of East Asians in large numbers is filtering in a cognitive elite.  It is very likely that they will eventually assume a leadership position.</p>
<p>I also suspect that the social and economic policies in many western nations have been dysgenic. </p>
<p>It has recently been said that the English middle class are now worse of than they were 400 years ago.</p>
<p>The costs of affirmitve avtion, the social burden of hispanic and black crime, the need to spend large sums of <br>
money to find a safe neighbourhood and schools the destruction of the middle classes as the US become somewhat <br>
of a kleptocracy and secure emplyment is offshored seems to reduce the fertillity of Whites.</p>
<p>All these burdens add up to delaying child birth while savings and carears are built over longer periodes.</p>
<p>On the otherhand the more impulsive and less insightfull are having large numbers of children.</p>
<p>Better teaching and training, cheaper books, IT technology has perhaps hidden the decline which must happen.</p>

		<p>The slowest learners of all our white liberals who continue to believe that blacks and &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; will somehow &#8220;catch up&#8221; to whites if we &#8220;eliminate racism&#8221;, whatever that means.</p>
<p>As Jared Taylor has pointed out, these people are not just hypocrites, they really believe their own raving, jabbering lunacy.</p>
<p>As a former liberal myself, I can testify that it is absolutely unthinkable - absolutely unimaginable - or one well-educated, successful white liberal to say to another: </p>
<p>&#8220;we&rsquo;d better just play along with this whole crazy race equality business, but really, there&rsquo;s something totally Alice in Wonderland about pretending that blacks have the same mental ability as whites. Most black adults are struggling with simple concepts and tasks that would be easy for most white children. If more education were going to eliminate the gap between blacks and whites, it would&rsquo;ve been gone 35 years ago. They really are sort of dumb, aren&rsquo;t they??&#8221;</p>
<p>These kind of conversations do not take place, for the simple reason that liberals are not exercising just speech control, they are exercising thought control, i.e., on themselves.</p>
<p>The possibility that as a rule, blacks really aren&rsquo;t very smart is literally unthinkable.</p>
<p>Until this changes, we will continue to squander trillions of dollars and meaningless programs designed to achieve the impossible. </p>

Did you have to pay your dues with &#8220;under performing minority students&#8221; to get those high performing Orientals, or were you fortunate enough to be assigned to them right after you finished college? <br>
 <br>
The problem with forcing white and Oriental teachers to start at the bottom is that many get burned out and quit, or they get fired for not achieving the impossible. </p>

		<p>What difference does it make?  It&rsquo;s been nearly 100 years since education was worth anything.  It&rsquo;s been replaced by marxist indoctrination.</p>
<p>Doing well in school, literally means how well you can present yourself as a marxist, so as to be offered a job.</p>
<p>However, things have changed in the last 2 decades.  Now, it is no longer sufficient to be a marxist.  You have to be non-white, as well&hellip;.or gay.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this burning down of our economic system are anyone who produces something tangible that people want or provide a service that people need.  Non-whites are incapable of doing real work of any worth.  So a white person who wants a job MUST focus on acquiring the skills needed to do real work of worth.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care how many phony PhDs come out of India, if there is a real problem to solve, they CANNOT solve it and MUST hire a white man to solve it or leave the problem unfixed&hellip;.usually followed by the company going out of business.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the new FORCED economy.  Where they don&rsquo;t want to hire you because of the color of your skin&hellip;but have no other choice in order to get a task accomplished.</p>
<p>There is no room for English teachers, computer programmers and poly sci majors in that economy.  And no reason to toe the marxist line either.  Nor any particular reason to not form small companies that compete with the giant corporations being looted by non-whites and neo-communists.  If you see blacks in high up positions in a company, it&rsquo;s time to strike and take business from them.  They won&rsquo;t be able to respond appropriately.</p>

Even conservative publications like &#8220;The Washington Times&#8221; avoid this topic. They would rather stick to advocating economic policies that make the rich richer. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Today&rsquo;s white kids are NOT violent or aggressive like certain groups but they tend to text in class and spend too much time playing with social media at home while the Asian kids study the maths and sciences.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do Asians have to spend so much time studying if they&rsquo;re so smart?  Sounds like you&rsquo;re praising them for being good little programmable robots.  Rote memorization is no way to learn; questioning, exploring, and experimenting are&hellip;not to mention a little defiance against &#8220;teachers.&#8221;  Expecting white kids to &#8220;learn&#8221; in the Asian manner is another form of dumbing them down.</p>

<p>&#8220;My Slavic ancestors found out that Asians where their future alright during the late Middle Ages, as in millions dead, cities razed to the ground such as Kiev and the populace being ruled by ethnic aliens that exploited them. Eventually my Russian ancestors violently overthrew them and drove them out, those who didn&rsquo;t get beheaded by Russian swords that is. Asians have not changed when it comes to their core beliefs and character since Ghengis and Kublai Kahn, whose names is synomyous in the minds of Russians with death and destruction. Want proof? Just look at how the Chinese and Japanese have acted during the past century for a clue. Be careful what you wish for Jennifer, you might get it and the rest of us along with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.  I am amazed that a &#8220;teacher&#8221; would say &#8220;Asia is our future,&#8221; with such excitement because it requires such a narrow sampling of the Asian character and the overall social, economic, and even environmental history of Asia.  Check the origin and course of the most devastating disease pandemics in history, including modern times and you will find Asian origins.  Asians and in particular Chinese groups are overall very superstitious and utilitarian.  They still believe in magic medicine and fraudulent aphrodisiacs.  They destroy land in swathes and species in mass through over-harvesting and complete lack of environmental foresight.  The U.S. West Coast has been suffering from this for decades now.  China and the Asia contains the most polluted cities in the world.  It is an old and possibly stereotyped bit of bigotry, but at least to rulers, life is cheap in Asia.</p>
<p>If Asia is our future, it only fits into a model that regardless of the deceptive hopefulness (to the Jennifer&rsquo;s out there), is the prodrome of human a worldwide population collapse.  But maybe that is biological destiny given the inability of humankind to manage itself?</p>

<p>&#8220;Jennifer, Did you have to pay your dues with &ldquo;under performing minority students&rdquo; to get those high performing Orientals, or were you fortunate enough to be assigned to them right after you finished college? </p>
<p>The problem with forcing white and Oriental teachers to start at the bottom is that many get burned out and quit, or they get fired for not achieving the impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
John, you are so right.  Almost all the job openings are in horrible ghetto schools. There are always openings because the teachers black, White, hispanic, asian whatever are driven out in less than 1 year by the Lord of the Flies jungle atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are only 2 ways a teacher can get a job in a civilized White or asian district.</p>
<p>(1) Have a friend or relative either a prinicpal or in the human resources office who can arrange the job for you.  This is the most common.</p>
<p>(2) Have a math or chemistry physics credential and have your application and resume in their data bases when there is an opening.</p>
<p>There are almost no openings in decent school districts because teachers lucky enough to work in those districts never quit until retirement. </p>

		<p>Note that Jennifer never says where she teaches.  She claims she teaches in a mostly asian school.  There are a few mostly asian schools, but not many. Cupertino, Sunnyvale and Mountain View in silicon valley Ca. come to mind.  </p>
<p>Seattle is the home of microsoft and other IT companies.  There are many children of asian tech workers in Seattle. Seattle hoever, is ultra liberal and very pro black.  So Seattle carefully busses thug blacks into all the schools.  </p>
<p>Seattle public schools do have lots of intelligent well behaved Whites and asians, but the bussed in blacks and the high number of vicious black women administrators make Seattle a horrible system for teachers.</p>
<p>San Francisco is the same.  Few Whites, major group asians and a few thug blacks.  But the blacks are bussed into asian neighborhoods and the unfortunate asians are bussed into black neighborhoods and the black thugs ruin the teaching experience.</p>
<p>Most asians live in the big cities where blacks live.  Texas and California are the only states I know of where large numbers of asians live in suburbs, although many Hmong have been settled in rural areas.</p>
<p>Most asian students are city dwellers and like the teachers, have to suffer the horrors of schooling with black thugs.</p>
<p>So I doubt very much that Jennifer is lucky enough to teach in an all asian school unless she teaches somewhere in the silicon valley area of California or one of the Catholic schools in San Francisco or the Chinatown parishes  of other large cities like Chicago or NYC</p>

		<p>&#8220;I am a teacher at a predominantly Asian school and my job is like a dream come true- highly motivated and intelligent students who get upset if they get an A- and break down into tears apologizing when they forget to bring their homework.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jennifer is making things up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m White.  I&rsquo;ve been around asians all my life.  Asians don&rsquo;t go around displaying their emotions as Whites, hispanics and blacks do. Even the little ones would not cry if they forgot their homework.  </p>
<p>Their upwardly mobile Mothers check them before they leave the house for homework, lunch, money, warm clothes whatever they need.  In addition to Mother, asian households usually have grandmas, aunts and other relatives in the crowded households to make sure the kids go off to school with every thing they need.</p>
<p>Before you spout off your cliches about asians Jennifer, work and live around asians.  Your ignorance about asians is very clear to anyone who has ever been around asians at work, at home, and whose White children have more asian schoolmates and neighborhood friends than White friends and schoolmates.</p>

<p>At the grade school level all that is needed to teach a child the basics to prepare him for a life of work, recreation and responsibility are:</p>
<p>An adequate teacher<br>
A book<br>
A pencil<br>
A piece of paper</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s the most required ingredient -</p>
<p>A child who wants to learn.  Don&rsquo;t even worry about his IQ if he has a desire.  He will learn an adequacy with help.</p>
<p>Everything else is gravy and most of it is a waste of taxpayer&rsquo;s money.</p>
<p>Successful farmers ready to retire today who came out of my mom&rsquo;s one-size-fits-all country classroom sixty years ago have better rounded educations than most kids graduating from college today.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine &#8220;tried to teach,&#8221; as he puts it, in a black public school. It was a horrible experience for him, and an eye opening experience for me, because until talking to him about it I really believed all that liberal nonsense that blamed the poor quality of ghetto schools on insufficient funding, bad teachers, and so on. <br>
 <br>
My friend did not hate blacks when I knew him in high school. He does now. <br>
 <br>
Public school teachers are considered to be a liberal constituency. After the experience of teaching in a black school I wonder how most teachers can retain their liberal perceptions and values. After several dangerous years in a blackboard jungle they may still want the rich to pay higher taxes, but I do not see how they can continue to believe that racial prejudice and stereotypes are based on delusions. </p>

		<p>BTW, journalists with big hearts and big brains gaining parental permission to learn to interact with, and elicit information from, school age children  &mdash;  can get high impact stories.  It is big league stuff to learn how to interview children of upper level elementary grades, middle school levels and into gland land. The challenge is to be an obstetrician of their knowledge  &mdash;  not a sculptor working with it.   If given legal permission by parents to video tape such conversations, the yield would be raw footage that could make memorable documentaries.  Having props  &mdash;  school room furnishing,etc. to act out what actually goes on, would be part of an effective revelation.  This topic is something the children can tell us more about than we can easily learn elsewhere.  Of course trying to do this with actual Black /White lunch room interactions, would probably get you into one of Guantanamo&rsquo;s cages.  <br>

<p>  &mdash;  Autie Em</p>
<p>So true!</p>
<p>And, decent schools are becoming scarcer and scarcer and further and further apart.</p>
<p>You are 100% correct that THE only way to secure a position at a decent school is through some type of personal connection.  I was able to escape via this route  but it still took me nine long years to get out. The non-White school I was assigned to needed my White face to fill a mandated racial goal and had no intention of allowing me to transfer.  A personal acquaintance, to whom I owe a pound of flesh, played a trump card that allowed me to finally break free.</p>
<p>The ONLY entry to my current school is via a personal connection through the administration, district or local school offices.</p>
<p>(2) <i>Have a math or chemistry physics credential and have your application and resume in their data bases there is an opening.</i></p>
<p>I would up that to include a willingness to teach AP classes. Schools are desperate to offer AP classes, especially the worst black and hispanic schools.  I have a colleague who has had schools compete for him because of his ability and willingness to teach AP chemistry, economics, calculus and biology. He tells me that AP classes at black/hispanic schools are ridiculously easy, only the best students are allowed to enroll and class sizes are rarely over 10 and often fewer. If the administration pisses him off, he transfers out. </p>
<p>The other recommendation I would make is a willingness to coach either athletic or academic teams (also a big deal at black schools). Coaching takes up  huge amounts of personal time after school and on weekends and very few teachers are willing to sacrifice this time on top of their teaching assignment.  I&rsquo;ve known several teachers who have used this as an entry to decent schools and then quit after a year or two, once their positions were secured.  I know one teacher who agreed to coach a sport only because it allowed him to skip teachers&rsquo; meetings and professional developments.</p>
<p>These and other coping techniques are used by teachers to keep ourselves sane when quitting is not an option.  Lateral moves are easy in the teaching world as long as one knows the tricks of the trade.  Teaching is a business and developing connections just as important.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you may find yourself facing LWOP at a miserable, anarchic black school lorded over by malicious black female administrators who make it a daily point to make your job a living hell.</p>

		<p>I was in a gifted class in junior high, back in the mid-80s.  I can tell you from experience that they push such students into liberalism.  We did this thing called future problem solvers&hellip;coming up with solutions for things that were supposed to happen in the future.  Global warming was one thing that was pushed off on us.  I remember having the impression that Christianity was for uneducated rednecks or something.</p>
<p>I remember seeing this film or something about a White couple that had a Black child (I think they were in South Africa, it&rsquo;s been 25 years since I saw this) and the question was:  was the child white or black, and why?</p>
<p>(Now that I&rsquo;m more knowledgable, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that it was a throwback.  One or both of the parents must have had a black ancestor.)</p>
<p>The way I see it, they take the brighter children and indoctrinate them, for the not-so-bright, educate them just enough to be a worker drone, but not enough to think.  (Something the late George Carlin pointed out&hellip;and one of his routines where he didn&rsquo;t cuss QUITE as much!)</p>

		<p>Competent homeschoolers remind me of Christian monks during the Dark Ages. They kept what was left of civilzation alive while the rest of Europe was being raped, murdered, enslaved, and looted by barbarians. We&rsquo;re not at that point yet, but we&rsquo;re getting there. In Europe, the situation is similar.  Many atheist liberals are now sending their children to parochial schools. European public schools used to be the best in the world. Now they are turing into crime-ridden ghetto schools. My liberal, atheist, German friend sends his kids to Lutheran schools. He explained to me: &#8220;that way our kids are safe from the Muslims&#8221;&hellip;.so much for liberal atheism. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Rote memorization is no way to learn; questioning, exploring, and experimenting are&#8221;.</p>
<p>I somewhat disagree with this statement.  I learned by rote for at least the first 5 years of school and am quite grateful, especially when it came to math or science, which was difficult for me since I am very verbally oriented and both of my parents were English majors.  That said, I credit my parents with a lot of my learning because I received balance.  My mother was an advocate of the rote way and my father always told me to &#8220;question authority&#8221;.  This got me sent to the principal&rsquo;s office in high school a couple of times because I argued with history and government teachers, sometimes to the point of standing and shouting.  Once I received the chance to speak with our principal, he agreed with me and the curriculum was actually changed.  So, I think it&rsquo;s okay to memorize facts but always make sure you have another source of learning so that you don&rsquo;t swallow the public schools&rsquo; version of the &#8220;truth&#8221;.  The other sources back in the 70s and 80s were not-yet-liberal newspapers, encyclopedias, dictionaries, conversations with older people, and good old fashioned books, and NOT textbooks, at least not history, social studies, or government textbooks.  And today they&rsquo;re written with absolute lies.</p>
