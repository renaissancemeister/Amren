			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Harris, M Live (Flint), October 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With Devil&rsquo;s Night on Sunday, the city is once again asking for volunteers to patrol the streets to cut down on potential arsons.</p>
<p>City officials say there will be 50 volunteers working at the police ministations throughout the city and are asking for as many volunteers as possible to patrol their communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of vacant homes for arsonists to pick on with an estimated 10,000 in the city.</p>
<p>Lock said there will be an additional four or five police squad cars over the weekend. He would not say how many additional firefighters were working, but said the fire department will be aided by out-of-county fire departments.</p>
<p>Devil&rsquo;s Night in Flint has been hit or miss in the last five years with as little as five (2009) to as many as 15 (2008). There were eight fires last year. The Devil&rsquo;s Night arson numbers peaked in 1994 with 200 fires.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last year, the city set a record in arsons, but Devil&rsquo;s Night itself was relatively quiet. The night after, however, saw 11 fires on Halloween night and 27 for the entire weekend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While many patrol the streets or man the ministations, some people are trying to board up vacant homes to discourage fire bugs.</p>

		<p>Flint is another black war zone here in Michigan.  White people build cities and blacks burn them down&hellip;.but we are all equal!</p>
<p>A white soldier was recently home on leave in Flint and was robbed at gun point by a black robber.  Typical.   </p>

		<p>This is quite a perversion of Halloween.  Those who would point to &#8220;pagans&#8221; and other older European traditions that Halloween borrowed from (Catholic Church created &#8220;All Hallows&#8221; from the previous seasonal harvest festival of Samhaine).  The idea of Satan or the Devil, Bezelbub, or whatever is from the Middle East and Christianity, which needs Satan for its cosmology.  Earlier European traditions didn&rsquo;t have an evil doer entity.  A person either is/or does good or not, and was/is judged by that alone.</p>
<p>It looks like Flint is just getting out of control.  It is a neighbor of Detroit.</p>

		<p>Alan Greenspan&rsquo;s policy is to burn houses down.  Maybe the chief should investigate Alan Greenspan.</p>

		<p>Oh yes, Devil&rsquo;s Night.  As a child I lived in the Detroit suburbs, and on Devil&rsquo;s Night Dad would have &#8220;Old Trusty,&#8221; his .357 Magnum, ready to go just in case&hellip;we lived only a few blocks north of Eight Mile Road (dividing line between Detroit and its northern suburbs).</p>
<p>Considering how rundown Detroit looks (and no doubt Flint  &mdash;  I remember hearing how ghetto it was when I was growing up in the 80s), I have to wonder a) is there anything left to set on fire and b) would anyone even notice?</p>
<p>Makes me glad to be living out near Amish Country in Ohio&hellip;.</p>

		<p>It has been quiet for some time now in Detroit during the Devil&rsquo;s Night celebrations. MOST all of what can be burned has already been burned? NOW the perps have to search for greener pastures? Maybe that is what this is. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a strangely comforting &#8220;nature in the raw is seldom mild&#8221; sort of vibe to this.  Fire IS purifying, and forest fires DO serve a natural purpose in the big picture.  Nature in the raw is also quite self correcting - a process which may be harrowing in the limited vista but again&hellip;</p>
<p>Comforting in the grand scope. </p>

<p>The idea of &#8220;Satan&#8221; actually came from an ancient Iranian religion called Zoroastrianism.  The Zoroastrians believed in a good god named Ahura Mazda and a bad god named Ahriman.</p>
<p>The Jews incorporated this idea into their religion when they were liberated from the Babylonian captivity by King Darius of Persia.</p>

<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it either. There was no such thing when I was a kid.  Halloween was a time for fun, for dunking apples, for cider and candy. Not for wreaking mayhem. </p>

<p>Actually, we already have Kwanzaa.   Don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ve gotten to Easter yet.</p>
<p>Can you imagine a bad Easter bunny who goes around setting fire to houses?  That could only come from the black mentality.  Whites build;  blacks destroy.</p>

		<p>It is easy to sit before your home computer, in your split level mansion, surrounded by every luxury money can buy and make fun of poor black and brown folks who are victims of institutional racism, elitism, ethnic bigotry and bad luck in the gene pool. You begrudge folks one night a year to strike back at the man. Do you think we like having to go out and burn down entire city blocks if we could be drinking martinis at the Grosse Pointe Country club? Poverty, frustration, police brutality, have ground us down to the point that we have to strike out at the rich white man. &#8221; I`m through with your snubs. I`m through with your spurns. Down with the white man, now burn baby burn.&#8221; &#8221; Give me your poor, your black,your mentally challenged huddled masses yearning to raise a little hell. I left my torch before your neighbor`s burning front door.&#8221; Apologies to Emma Lazarus.<br>

		<p>To those who claim to know that the origin of Satan is with the ancient Persians or Middle Ages Christians, please read the whole Bible.  The veracity of this holy book is, of course, open to the interpretation of each person who reads it.  But, it seems quite obvious that the belief in a being referred as Satan or The Enemy goes far, far back into pre-history.  <br>
It is simply smugness and arrogance for anyone to assert that he knows absolutely where the origin lies.  </p>

<p>When you say &#8220;the whole Bible&#8221;, do you mean the Old Testament or the New Testament?  In the Old Testament, Satan is merely an angel in God&rsquo;s court who prosecutes humans.  God uses him to test Job&rsquo;s faith.  In the New Testament, he becomes an all-encompassing entity of evil.  Something must have happened in between.</p>

<p>In Zoroastrian scriptures, Mithra occupies a position roughly equal to that of Ahura Mazda.  This is what the Mihir Yast of the Zend Avesta says:</p>
<p><i>1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathustra, saying: &#8216;Verily, when I created Mithra, the lord of wide pastures, O Spitama! I created him as worthy of sacrifice, as worthy of prayer as myself, Ahura Mazda.</i></p>

<p>  &mdash;  Browser</p>
<p>What is Easter?</p>
<p>That holiday has been throughly eradicated from the schools   &mdash;   along with every other White-celebrated holiday.</p>
<p>Hallowe&rsquo;en is now &#8220;Harvest Festival.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The ONLY person allowed his own holiday is the plastic god MLK   &mdash;   all White presidents have been assigned to the generic President&rsquo;s Day, which hardly garners any notice anywhere.</p>
<p>Christmas is known now as Winter Festival.  I think displaying a Christmas tree in my classroom, or possibly even mentioning Christmas could cost me my job and pension.  But Kwanzaa and Chinese New Year?  Well, those are honored with assemblies and showered with attention because that&rsquo;s celebrating &#8220;diversity!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanksgiving Day and Columbus Day are known as Native American Holocaust days; Columbus now equal with Hitler.</p>
