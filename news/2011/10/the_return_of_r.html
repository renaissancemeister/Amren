<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=355449">The Return of Race Riots to America</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Colin Flaherty, World Net Daily, October 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Thank God for YouTube. Or else we never would have know that hundreds of times in more than 50 cities since 2010, groups of black people have been roaming the streets of America  &mdash;  assaulting, intimidating, stalking, threatening, vandalizing, stealing, shooting, stabbing, even raping and killing.</p>
<p>But today the denials are crumbling. The curtains are lifting. We now can see what so many public officials and media have been curiously desperate to deny: Race riots are back.</p>
<p>And not just in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York. Places like Iowa, Wisconsin, Colorado and Indiana have their very own race riots, too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at Philadelphia. In the spring of 2010, large groups of black people  &mdash;  as in thousands  &mdash;  began gathering in the &#8220;eclectic&#8221; section of South Philadelphia. Mayhem and violence followed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then came the YouTube videos, showing thousands of black people roaming the streets of Philadelphia, with violence and injury following. Pizza shops, hotels, bar, tourists, the largest attacks all took place on South Street.</p>
<p>Pulling people out of cars and beating them.</p>
<p>And there were lots and lots of video cameras: Local network affiliates were all over it with video. But no one had the nerve to say what they video screamed: All the attackers and looters were black.</p>
<p>Police claimed that none of the injuries imposed by the mob was serious. Turns out they had not even checked. Ronnie Polaneczky, columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer, did.</p>
<p>She found John, a maintenance mechanic, who suffered severe brain injury and facial fractures and was still in the hospital two weeks after he was pulled from a bike and beaten.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In July 2011, hundreds of blacks created an &#8220;astonishing&#8221; amount of violence at downtown Philadelphia restaurants, hotels and bars.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>July 4, 2011, 10-20black people assault and stab a student and his dog from LaSalle University.He&rsquo;s still alive, though many people do not know why. The dog probably saved him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Spring of 2010,police break up a black flash mob in the Tioga-Nicetown section of Philly. Kids were bored and acting stupid, said the reporter. The video tells another story.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then came the reader comments to the race-neutral stories: Hundreds and hundreds wanted to know why reporters repeatedly refused to identify the race of the attackers.</p>
<p>People knew two things were important: One, large groups of black people were systematically assaulting people in their town; and two, lots of people seemed way too heavily invested in not talking about the central organizing feature of the crime: The gangs of violent criminals were black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then, one month later, Philadelphia&rsquo;s black Mayor Nutter blew all the deniers out of the water.</p>
<p>After years of denying and explaining dozens of attacks, Nutter took to the pulpit of a local black church to break the silence and mention the &#8220;R&#8221; word: Race. In a Sunday speech in July of 2011, the mayor admitted his city had a problem with violent black people:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have damaged your own race.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All the kids needed, said the mayor and his crew, was a place to go. Something to do. How about bowling? So the mayor organized a &#8220;Teen Night&#8221; bowling for the kids  &mdash;  which was just fine until someone got stabbed in a fight after the bowling.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several months after her attack, Guendelsberger is going through some changes, she told NPR. After Mayor Nutter got religion, so did she:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid of young, black men now. It&rsquo;s very annoying because there are a lot of young, black men in Philadelphia. I honestly just wish I could go back to how I was before,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>And all these attacks began one year after a Department of Justice investigation found that black students at South Philadelphia High School had been systematically assaulting Asian students for years. When this story broke, the superintendent of schools gave the Asian students a pamphlet, telling them how to talk and act towards blacks so they would not antagonize them.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not just Philly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Public officials, local media and even victims may be too squeamish to talk about the new race riots, but YouTube is not. Neither is talk radio.</p>
<p>So we learn in fits and starts and pieces and glimpses. Finally, we are connecting the dots. Which is good: The solutions cannot begin until the denial ends. But first we all need to hear  &mdash;  and see  &mdash;  it.</p>

		<p>So Emily saw the light. I don&rsquo;t imagine she&rsquo;ll be posting on Amren anytime soon. I wonder if her and Kumar are still together. Glenn Beck was the only mainstream anchor that ever showed the videos, albeit in a PC manner.  This is 2011, we have youtube, vimeo, dailymotion, and liveleak, who needs the MSM. I only catch CNN in the break room at work, which is usually Anderson Cooper. People are sick of the perpetual leftist propaganda. Illegal immigrants are a prime example. They just keep spinning and spinning, and nobody believes it. We have a real unemployment rate of close to 20%, and they&rsquo;re still talking about amnesty. </p>

<p>MSM, like the Knoxville Horror, says it didn&rsquo;t happen. The You Tube videos are shocking. The black gate is opening, Where is Aragorn? </p>

		<p>Interesting how it&rsquo;s only blacks you here about rioting when a race war is involved. You never hear about Whites, Asians, Latinos, or anyone else. Blacks are only 13% of the population yet commit ALL of the race riots. It can&rsquo;t be denied. This why is &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; have become a synonym for &#8220;blacks rioting&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a resident of northern California. This past September, my daughter and grandson and I visited Philadelphia for the first time ever. We got lost trying to find our way to Chinatown, and we somehow ended up in the Gallery Shopping Mall, looking for a policeman to direct us. It was a little after three o&rsquo;clock, and school must have just let out, because we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of a lot of black teenagers carrying backpacks. When a fistfight broke out among three or four of them directly in front of us, we tried to get out of the way, but at 67, I don&rsquo;t move as fast as I once did, and one of the teens was literally thrown into me. I didn&rsquo;t fall over but I was pushed up against a wall and I cried out. &#8220;Shut yo&rsquo; f***in&rsquo; mouth, grandma!&#8221; the punk screamed at me. &#8220;Just wait till the Flower Show! I&rsquo;ll kick your old white a**!&#8221; I was too frightened to say anything, but all his punk friends thought it was hilarious. They ran off laughing and shouting, &#8220;Wait till the Flower Show, grandma!&#8221; My daughter was in tears and my young grandson was shaking and crying with fright.</p>
<p>What an introduction to the City of Brotherly Love! We cut our vacation short and flew home the next day.</p>

		<p>Tim Wise mentioned that he wanted to start dialogue, not discriminate and battle &#8220;white hysteria of black people (his words),&#8221; and explain that this is all caused by white privilege.</p>
<p>I think we should send him into Phily as our representative.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure he can help by dismantling his own privilege by giving his wallet and clothes for starters&hellip;</p>
<p>After all he didn&rsquo;t really earn his status in life because he was given an advantage by his forefathers for simply being perceived as &#8220;white.&#8221;</p>

		<p>And this despite all the things being in place that the libtards said were needed to solve our racial problems: greater affluence of blacks, access to consumer goods like computers and cellphones, a huge black presence in the media, greater suburbanization by the black populace (while driving whites out with crimes like this) and even a wonderful black &#8220;role model&#8221; president. In fact, if anything, these things have made matters worse. And the mendacious media not only refuses to admit that they were wrong but tries to cover up the problem. What better example is there that the media no longer represents American interests?</p>

		<p>&#8220;first we all need to hear &mdash; and see &mdash; it&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard and seen enough and this was 40 years ago. I was way too dumb and naive then to have seen enough, however. Perhaps i&rsquo;ve learned something other than the correct way to talk to black people since then. I mentioned to a black woman, just in passing, about a relative of mine who had been victimized. She was one of the talented-tenth, apparently. Those folks were the true victims, desperate and at the end of their capacity to endure hardship, according to her. </p>

		<p>As the country song goes, &#8220;I wish I didn&rsquo;t know now what I didn&rsquo;t know then&#8221;.  Guendelsberger is, of course, expressing the belief that all whites  &mdash;  including herself  &mdash;  are racists.  Now the poor dear has been made fearful of all male blacks because of this one itsy-bitsy incident in which kids ran playfully past her and she fell down!  Hopefully, she really IS afraid now and will state that it&rsquo;s because she actually has reason to be fearful of black men and boys.  But I&rsquo;ll bet all she&rsquo;s saying is that people, including herself, are reacting emotionally and blowing the whole thing out of proportion.  </p>

		<p>To hear what blacks are doing listen to a police scanner. Online there is one called rollcallradio. Last week I heard a cop undercover going through a park with his wife and three blacks exposed their organs at them. It will never make the news but is totally common for them. The undercover was surrounding the park by radio and trying to catch them. That is here in Baltimore. Blacks here are totally crazy.</p>

		<p>Matthew Chew, 25 was attacked by six black teens who punched, kicked and stabbed him to death. He was unarmed walking home from work at 11:30 at night in  October 2010 The six blacks stopped Matt and asked him for a lighter. These kids are on trial now in New London, CT. They were not charged with a hate crime. They admitted they are local gang members. The black teens said they did it because they were &#8220;bored.&#8221;<br>
Seventy or more black students from the local high school, skipped school and showed up in court to cheer for the black teen murders. They were so loud and disruptive that they had to be removed from the court. They also had tee shirts made with the names of the killers and wore them to school to show their support. Minimal news or media coverage. Matthew&rsquo; s murder was neatly swept under the rug. <br>
Sadly when I suggested it was a racially motivated hate crime it was mainly white people that verbally attacked me and defended the crime as &#8220;random violence &#8220;<br>
I will never forget Matthew C Chew. Rest in Peace, beautiful one.</p>

		<p>Here  in Oakland my black co-worker was at a park having a picnic with a lot of her black family and friends. Cops came to the park to have a picnic as well, really ticking off the locals. My co-worker&rsquo;s friends ran over and beat and stomped the cops half to death.  My co-worker said she &#8220;almost&#8221; felt sorry for a lady cop who got her head stomped on. This happens often, but never makes the papers. Cops and blacks are like lyons and hyenas, or, as Hank Williams might say, Hitler and Netanyahu, mortal enemies. If the cops are getting their butts kicked on a regular basis, the rest of us don&rsquo;t stand a chance.</p>

		<p>Is there any data on the number of flash mob violent incidents initiated by race? Have there been violent flash mobs initiated by non-blacks, and what is their percentage of the total? And has there been any postings of videos of non-black flash mob violence?</p>
<p>You need to look at the bigger picture. See if the case is solid that this is a majority black phenomenon.</p>
<p>But if there is a trend of black initiated flash mob violence, you also need to look at the political end. Is this one result of the anti-white agitprop common in the media and academia? Or the perception of weakness among whites? </p>
<p>And are the American flash mobs related to the kind of criminal violence in the rainbow nation of South Africa which borders on ethnic cleansing of white people? </p>
<p>One wonders if they will be chanting, &#8220;Kill the Boer, kill the farmer&#8221; in America&hellip;</p>

		<p>Good article, except for one important thing. I&rsquo;m glad to see someone, even if it&rsquo;s an almost-unknown columnist, have the courage to stand up and state the obvious fact that all the flash mob thugs are black. But that&rsquo;s only half of the equation. The part he failed to mention is that none of the victims - NONE of them - are black. The vast majority of the victims of these black flash mobs are White, with a few Asians and Hispanics making up the remainder. Blacks are specifically targeting Whites for violence. This full statement is what needs to be repeated. We as White men and women are in danger, and we need to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>Even bringing up the racial aspect of flash mobs isn&rsquo;t always good enough, because often people who do that try to portray blacks as &#8220;the real victims.&#8221; Mayor Nutter is a good example, talking about the damage these attacks have done to blacks&rsquo; reputations. What about the physical and emotional damage done to the White victims of the assaults? Who talks about that? Neocons, libertarians, and even leftists are willing to talk about black-on-black crime, but who has the courage to speak up about the epidemic of black-on-White crime?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen lies posted on other websites, such as &#8220;99% of black crime is against other blacks&#8221;, &#8220;Black-on-White rape is exceptionally rare&#8221;, &#8220;99% of child molesters are White&#8221;, etc. I want to expose those lies here and now.</p>
<p>FACT: Black criminals choose White victims 45% of the time and black victims 43% of the time. Black-on-White crime is MORE common than black-on-black crime.</p>
<p>FACT: 37,000 White women are raped by blacks each year.</p>
<p>FACT: Blacks are four times more likely than Whites to be child molesters.</p>
<p>These facts are straight from the Department of Justice. No leftist who has posted his lies has ever been able to show his source when asked.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s ironic (and very disturbing) that those Philly thugs you encountered shouted at you &#8220;Just wait till the Flower Show! I&rsquo;ll kick your old white a**!&#8221;</p>
<p> You probably don&rsquo;t know this, but here in Philadelphia, the annual flower show that&rsquo;s held at the Convention Center is almost the last remnant of white civility left in town. A decidedly older crowd of (yes, largely white) folks flock into the city from the surrounding suburbs for a few days just to enjoy an early taste of Spring.</p>
<p> I know that attacks on patrons of the city&rsquo;s ballet and symphony orchestra have left many people unwilling to attend performances in Center City, but it&rsquo;s a crime to think that we will also lose the flower show just because alot of local thugs have decided to target vulnerable visitors!</p>

		<p>&#8220;the superintendent of schools gave the Asian students a pamphlet, telling them how to talk and act towards blacks so they would not antagonize them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antagonize THEM! THEM! THEM were not being antagonized. THEY were being bullies. The black derives a perverse and sickening pleasure from bullying others and the worse the bullying the more they enjoy it. And it was NOT for some manner of talking or walking or dressing or anything like for that these attacks occurred. It was merely for the black to act as a bully!</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a web site where we can see this pamphlet for ourselves. What sorts of lessons can we whitey learn too.</p>

		<p>I can understand what Guendelsberger is going through. At one time, I thought that race didn&rsquo;t matter and that blacks were generally just as good as whites. Then I began to notice that blacks take up most of the rowdies and criminals by far. In fact, they were the reason why my neighborhood wasn&rsquo;t safe. Yet at the same time, the idea of equality has been gospel for decades now, and asking a liberal to deny it must be like asking a devout Christian to deny that Christ was the messiah. But hopefully, Guendelsberger will realize that it&rsquo;s sensible to be scared of young, black men, especially after being the victim of such a terrible crime commited by them. </p>

		<p>Blacks and non-Whites in general are getting a stealth pass from successive governments throughout the Western world to commit full-scale genocide against European originated White nations.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, government sponsored <i>DEMOCIDE</i></p>
<p>There are still enough Whites on the planet to turn this around.  </p>
<p>We ought to be pulling the gloves off and looking at taking out our traitorous leaders, one by one, if necessary.  </p>
<p>It can be achieved by reporting every criminal act they&rsquo;ve  committed especially if they belong to a certain tribe.  This can be done by simply keep relating relevant events throughout history - past and present where they were implicated, providing factual evidence, in other word, <b>the truth.</b></p>
<p>It must be relentlessly pursued without letup even when the tables have turned in one&rsquo;s favour once again.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a case of playing them at their own game by exposing their dirty secrets and hidden crimes, past and present, against peoples of other ethnicities and <b>their</b> nations.</p>
<p>In the present political/social climate one can be forgiven for abandoning hope of defeating the System, but chipping away at its foundations and the continuous exposure of its crimes WILL bring about its downfall.  Nothing can survive such determined and relentless scrutiny and criticism.  </p>
<p>One finds that others outside one&rsquo;s own ethnicity become invariably convinced by the increasing expose and evidence of the machinations and crimes of another ethnicity and their cohorts, and are then drawn to joining forces with previously defined adversaries.</p>
<p>One of the chief reasons for this is because those belonging to more intelligent races can observe ahead of time, a potential for the same dangers descending upon their own unless steps are taken to permanently avert any such dangers by remaining forever vigilant and that means being prepared to take any type and degree of action necessary before the onset.</p>

		<p>Detroit has been strangely quiet for several years.  We have had small flash mobs&hellip;3-30 black kids trashing and robbing stores but not BIG riots as I have seen in other cities.  </p>
<p>A lot of white yuppies too young to remember the last race riot of 1967 are moving back into the city.  I will not be moving back.  With the amount of poverty and black males wandering the streets with no high school diploma and multiple felony convictions, I honestly don&rsquo;t see how another riot can be avoided.   </p>
<p><br>
If a white person ever gets elected to the all black Detroit city council, the back-lash from blacks will be interesting to watch as they will feel like they are losing their power. </p>

		<p>These are hardly riots. Riots involve two groups fighting one another. What we&rsquo;re witnessing is blacks violently targeting and attacking whites and most of the whites not even lifting a finger to fight back.</p>
<p>The thing that&rsquo;s sad and pathetic about these black on white assaults is that many are taking place in places where whites greatly outnumber the blacks. If whites seriously fought back against these genetic criminals then blacks would start to back off. </p>
<p>Back in 2001 here in the Northwest, we had the infamous &#8216;Fat Tuesday&rsquo; violence in Pioneer Square. I&rsquo;m not going to call what happened a riot because whites didn&rsquo;t fight back that night against a marauding group of an estimated 40-50 blacks who came into the area with nothing more on their minds than attacking whites. The crowd of revelers in Pioneer Square was estimated to be 4-5,000 people; well over 90% of whom you can bet were white. Most whites there that night just watched the vicious violence unfold and hoped they wouldn&rsquo;t be attacked by these beautiful blacks. If several thousand whites are too scared to fight back against four dozen or so blacks&hellip;what does that say about the white man today? Blacks like to bully and intimidate. Stand up to black bullying and intimidation, guess what, most of them will back off if you show you mean business.</p>
<p>Most blacks are cowards. That&rsquo;s why they usually choose easy targets to attack. Women, children, outnumbered or wimpy looking white men and the elderly. What they&rsquo;re banking on is not too much resistance for their genetically-inspired criminal behavior. It&rsquo;s almost like something gets knocked out of kilter in their genetic code when people are willing to strongly risk resisting their savagery.<br>

<p>Same thing in Philly on South St. They cancelled the annual MArdi Gras party due to &#8220;unruly behavior&#8221; of the revelers according to the news media, but cell phone video showed gangs of Mau Mau sucker punching White people as they walked along the street. There was not one incident of assaults BY Whites. The news video showed the attackers from the waist down so that they couldn&rsquo;t be identfied by race. <br>
South St. was also where the Black Panther called for the killing of &#8220;crackers&#8221; and their little babies and was not even arrested for inciting to violence; not that Mau Mau need to be &#8220;incited&#8221;. </p>

<p>Anonymous 26, you&rsquo;re right. This one doesn&rsquo;t pass the smell test. First off, no local cop in his right mind would take his family to Oakland for a picnic. Oakland is infamous for one hundred miles around as being Detroit without the panache.</p>
<p>Second,there would have been all kinds of teletype messages, officer safety bulletins, and locker room talk about this incident, and this is the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it. I work three cities away from Oakland. We all would have at least mentioned the incredible stupidity of that act.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a resident of a Philadelphia suburb and have occasion to go into center-city from time to time.  My route typically takes me through certain all-black areas.</p>
<p>I keep my car doors and windows locked and my loaded M19 S&W; on the seat beside me.  When I stop and get out it goes into my high-ride Bianchi hip holster. I fear some but not much evil.</p>
<p>PA is a right to carry state. Why every law-abiding citizen in Philadephia, black or white, doesn&rsquo;t get a carry permit and become reasonably proficient with the sidearm of their choice baffles me.</p>
<p>A few well publicized shootings of street gang members would have a remarkable effect on the incidence of street crime in this once beautiful city.</p>

<p>Prepare yourselves ahead of time by intense situational awareness, full tanks of gas so you won&rsquo;t have to stop for gas in unsavory neighborhoods, and escape routes from your places of work that are relatively safe. Heck, leave work early on election day (you have to vote, right!!!). </p>
<p>If you are capable, arm yourself; at the very least, have bear spray (pepper spray) handy.</p>
<p>Things will get VERY nasty!! </p>

		<p>Although Philadelphia is closer to where I live, I travel to New York if I want to go see a show or concert because it is safer.  It seems a lot of higher functioning immigrants have settled in New York.  If not for them, the blacks would have taken over  City Hall and crime would be as bad as Philly.</p>

<p>Police are armed when off duty.  It is not a choice, it is a requirement.  How did the witness know they were police?  Were they in uniform off duty picniking with their families?</p>
<p>Maybe they were plain clothes detectives or uniformed patrol who went to the park to eat their lunch outside.</p>

		<p>Poster 4 and 17 wrote about threats being made against Whites who attend the Philly flower show.</p>
<p>A few months ago there was an article posted about how the symphony and opera companies around the country are going under because of lack of attendance.</p>
<p>The Philly symphony was mentioned.  I posted a comment that the reason is because the Whites only go into the city if they have to to work.  Driving 50 miles back with the danger of being attacked by blacks to go to a concert or opera is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The flower show threat is why all those things that make a city attractive have disappeared because of black on White violence.</p>
<p>One of the big universities in my city sponsored a memorial day weekend family carnival every year.  The carnival raised money for a summer camp for under priviliged children, most of whom were black.</p>
<p>The carnival began in the mid 1920&rsquo;s.  It was canceled in 1998 because of marauding blacks.  The took city buses to the carnival, invaded, beat, raped and robbed. After several years of this the university ended a 70 year tradition.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful event.  Ended by out of control black thuggery.  Several times I saw 50 or more blacks pour out of the city buses.  They had to go through a business district to get to the campus.  They invaded and robbed the businesses as well.</p>
<p>Same old same old  Whites build, blacks destroy.</p>

<p>Exactly.  The last real race riot that I know of happened here in Chicago, in 1919.  And it was a doozy.  All inner city riots since then have simply been blacks on a rampage.   A real race riot involves the races, both of them, fighting it out.  I&rsquo;m thinking of printing up some tees with &#8220;Sprit of &#8216;19&#8221; on them.  Only race realists will know, at first, what it stands for.  1919 may be the last large scale example of whites not only protecting themselves from blacks, but going on to inflict enough punishment on the transgressors to earn the respect that only fear induces.       </p>
