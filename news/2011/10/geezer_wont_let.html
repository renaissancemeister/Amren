			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Philly, October 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An 84-year-old ex-university official savagely attacked by four young punks during a walk in Wissahickon Valley Park earlier this week theorizes that the beating he endured was a cruel game of &#8220;get the old geezer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Shea, a former vice president of university relations for Temple, from 1968 to 1983, walks up to five miles on Forbidden Drive, in Fairmount Park, three times a week, but that type of stamina wasn&rsquo;t enough to stave off the lowlifes who not only beat him bloody, but dealt a blow to one of the things he holds most dear  &mdash;  his pride.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt a real something to the head, a real blow to the head from behind,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It knocked me to the ground; that was the biggie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shea said the four assailants continued to beat him for minutes while he was on the ground. He said they were black, appeared to be between 16 and 20, and three of them were wearing La Salle sweatshirts.</p>
<p>Police and Shea said that at least one of the attackers used a rock to hit him, causing deep cuts above his eyes. They all kicked and punched him while he was on the ground, conscious the entire time.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was only one I really saw well because he came back to kick me,&#8221; Shea said. &#8220;The others spent a great deal of the time laughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The real &#8220;stunner&#8221; to Shea is that they left without trying to take his wallet, keys or cellphone.</p>

<p>And how many of your years as &#8220;director of university relations&#8221; did you spend promoting the glories of &#8220;diversity,&#8221; Jim?  Were you proud of all those Diverse, quota-filling Africans around you?  Did you ever tell your fellow Diversicrats how disgusted you were by Racist Nazi Hater White Supremacists?  Did you bow your head respectfully every MLK day?  </p>
<p>Those Fine Upstanding Youths of Color weren&rsquo;t after your goods, Jim, they were after <i>your White skin.</i>  Do you understand now, if only just a little bit?  Do you?</p>
<p>I can only wish that more university &#8220;administrators&#8221; could receive such a &#8220;stunning&#8221; lesson on the cold reality of the world outside their upholstered meeting rooms.<br>

		<p>Oh my God. This is beyond spooky. It was ONLY THIS WEEK on AmRen that I read about the elderly white woman in the Philadelphia Gallery being threatened and shoved by black thugs who swore to assault the elderly patrons at the upcoming Flower Show. Now it appears that they couldn&rsquo;t wait even a few months before they started stomping helpless white senior citizens. Two AmRen contributors rightly pointed out that this is the death knell for Center City&rsquo;s cultural establishments. No white person in their right mind would risk the beating that this poor old gentleman suffered. The Flower Show will run from March 4th through March 11th, 2012. I can just see every black punk in this city smacking his lips over the prospect of fresh white blood.</p>
<p>AmRen, you&rsquo;re batting a thousand. And it breaks my heart.</p>

		<p>I have heard many, many accounts of this kind of thing happening from word of mouth, not the Politically Correct media. If I were an old Gaffer (geezer) walking around where there could be any blacks, I would have a knife or gun to protect myself. Perhaps he was too trusting, a fault of MANY whites. I am not too far away from being an old gaffer myself, but a look at me would indicate otherwise.</p>

		<p>The trend I see here seems to be mostly leftists being attacked. This is because these types are mostly well off and are never around actual ghetto blacks, the only ones they see are in the media and Bill Cosby types. That&rsquo;s the real problem with liberals but this will eventually wake a lot of them up. As sick as they are even they don&rsquo;t like a beat down.</p>

		<p>Even after the severe beating Mr. Shea received at the hands of violent people he could not bring himself to admit the obvious.  The beating had nothing to do with his age and everything to do with his skin color.  He has remained a true believer in his fool&rsquo;s ideology of equality and diversity.  He no doubt has spent a lifetime in his hallowed university ivory towers sneering at whites who were worried and wished to preserve their heritage.</p>

		<p>This poor fellow, Jim, is clueless - which is probably why he had the job of university relations at Temple in the first place.</p>
<p>The school is smack in the middle of a black ghetto. The media has made it a contest over the years to cover-up crimes and downplay felonies, including murder, by local blacks against students. For the gentleman not to know his life was on the line is very strange. </p>
<p>The school also is a bastion of diversity-gone-crazy nonsense and pro-Afro mumbo-jumbo. </p>
<p>In a sad way it looks like this was Jim&rsquo;s delayed retirement party. I hate to see what Homecoming looks like.</p>

		<p>Sorry for the long post, but I thought it might be interesting to some readers.  It&rsquo;s from a essay entitled The Modern Theme by Jose Ortega y Gasset.  Perhaps it will help people understand the West&rsquo;s present historical situation. <br>
 <br>
&#8220;The tradionalist mind is a mechanism operating<br>
through credulity, for its whole activity consists in its<br>
reliance upon the unquestioned wisdom of the past.<br>
The rationalist mind breaks these bonds of credulity<br>
and replaces them with a fresh imperative: faith in<br>
individual energy, of which reason is the supreme<br>
instigator. But rationalism tries to do too much &mdash; in fact,<br>
aspires to the impossible. The proposal to substitute<br>
ideas for reality is admirable in its illusive electrical<br>
quality, but is always foredoomed to failure. An<br>
enterprise so disproportionately ambitious leaves a<br>
historical field behind it which becomes an area of<br>
disillusion. After the defeat of all his daring idealist aims<br>
man is left completely demoralised. He loses all spontaneous<br>
faith and does not believe in anything that works<br>
along manifest and disciplined lines. He respects neither<br>
tradition nor reason, neither collectivity nor the<br>
individual. His vital resources weaken because,<br>
definitively, it is the beliefs we cherish that keep such<br>
resources at concert pitch. He has not sufficient strength<br>
in reserve to maintain a suitable attitude before the<br>
mystery oflife and the universe. Physically and mentally<br>
he degenerates. In these epochs the human harvest is<br>
left to wither and the national populations dwindle.<br>
Not so much through famine, disease or other similar<br>
calamities as because the generative potency of man<br>
diminishes. Simultaneously, there is a decline in<br>
typically virile courage. Universal cowardice begins to<br>
prevail: a strange phenomenon which appeared equally<br>
in Greece and Rome and has not yet received its due<br>
emphasis. In times of security man possesses but half<br>
the measure of personal valour required to encounter<br>
the vicissitudes of life without disgrace. In such ages of<br>
waste valour becomes an unusual quality which is only<br>
possessed by a few. Its practice is made a profession whose exponents form a soldiery hostile to all public order<br>
and stupidly oppressive of the rest of the social body.<br>
This universal cowardice becomes apparent in the<br>
most delicate and intimate recesses of the mind, and<br>
projects itself in all directions. Men are terrified once<br>
more by lightning and thunder, as they were in the most<br>
primitive times. No one relies on his own personal<br>
vigour to enable him to triumph over difficulties. Life<br>
is felt to be a formidable accident, in which man is<br>
dependent upon mysterious and occult wills, acting in<br>
accordance with the most puerile caprices. The debased<br>
mind is incapable of offering resistance to destiny, and<br>
turns to superstitious practices in the hope of propitiating<br>
these hidden powers. The most absurd rites attract the<br>
adhesion of the multitude. Rome submits to the<br>
dominion of all the monstrous divinities of Asia, which<br>
had been so honourably disdained two centuries before.<br>
In short: the spirit of the time, being incapable of<br>
maintaining itself in equilibrium by its own unaided<br>
efforts, searches for some spar that will save it from the<br>
wreck, and examines its environment with the anxious<br>
and cringing look of a dog, hoping it may find someone<br>
to help it. The superstitious mind is, in effect, a dog in<br>
search of a master. Men cannot now even remember<br>
the noble gestures of pride they once assumed; and the<br>
imperative of liberty that resounded in their ears for<br>
centuries would now be totally incomprehensible. On<br>
the contrary, they feel an incredible anxiety to be slaves.<br>
Slavery is their highest ambition: slavery to other men,<br>
to an emperor, to a sorcerer or to an idol. Anything<br>
rather than feel the terror of facing singlehanded, in<br>
their own persons, the ferocious assaults of existence.<br>
Perhaps the name that best suits the spirit that comes<br>
into being beyond the sunset of revolution is the term,<br>
spirit of slavery.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Sorry to see American Renaissance sink to using &#8220;geezer&#8221; in its own headline for any reason.  &#8220;Geezer&#8221; is an element of the anti-white narrative specifically for older diverse white American men.  As if there is not enough of that going around.</p>
<p>Exactly what part of a &#8220;renaissance&#8221; is it to quote an article&rsquo;s headline and a self-loathing older white man for labels that demean, denigrate, and dismay?</p>

		<p>What gets me is that a 100 years ago if a gentleman went out for a walk he would carry a walking cane. A cane is a very deceptive weapon because people may assume it&rsquo;s to assist in walking but a cane is nothing more than a club with a little polish ( and maybe a knife or sword concealed). </p>
<p>The streets of America are as dangerous today as they ever were so why do people think they no longer need to be prepared to defend themselves? </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s certainly perplexing to the Left.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been lectured  in Europe by well meaning people that the ONLY reason  peaceful blacks commit crime is because in America they are subjected to such terrible racism and deprivation that they are FORCED to do so in order to survive.

<p>I agree with you on that. &#8220;Geezer&#8221; is not a complimentary word; it is sarcastic; it is dierespectful. It is certainly not a sympathetic word that one would use to descibe a victim.  I am not his age, but I would not appreciate being called a &#8220;geezer&#8221; in a newspaper story.<br>

Not from Philly, so no idea how Forbidden Drive got its unusual name. But wherever its source, it certainly fits nowadays. Forbidden to (unarmed) Whites, that is. </p>

A modified cane gun or zip gun would turn the tables on these black punks. A sting using an undercover cop disguised as a &#8220;geezer&#8221; would work too. Also, I doubt that his attackers were college grads, but you never know. Either way, he did not deserve the beatdown for being old and White and minding his own business.<br>

		<p>This reminds me of the race riots at the Wisconsin fair. By the way Rush played a clip of Farrakhan saying that the Arab Spring etc whatever the Muslim uprising is coming to your door and he said look its started in Wisconsin. Here in Baltimore, I have noticed a 50 percent increase in the average black male wearing the Muslim beard, so whites need to prepare for war. It&rsquo;s already here its just going to increase. A good idea is to get actual armed forces manuals off ebay or read online and train yourself mentally and physically so you are prepared.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately in the age we live in I practice the following tactics while walking.</p>
<p>- Ensure you are aware of your surroundings, do not wear headphones, earbuds, earmuffs, etc. Listen for footsteps or running.</p>
<p>- Check behind you often, if you see a group of &#8220;youths&#8221; move to the other side of the road. If they follow, you have been tagged as the victim.</p>
<p>- Carry the highest form of weapon allowed in your state. If a gun is not allowed carry a knife. Self defense walking sticks are available and effective. They are picking you because you look vulnerable, a weapon changes the equation. </p>
<p>- While brandishing your weapon do not allow fear to show on your face. Showing confidence will deter them further. </p>
<p>The good old days are gone, we have to be prepared. </p>

As a matter of fact, they are already doing that.  Those two white kids who killed the black in Mississippi are on CNN all the time for weeks now.  It has been used for the springboard of a new series entitled, &#8220;Is Mississippi Still Burning?&#8221;  This will be lorded over whites for at least a year. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a &#8220;Senior Citizen&#8221; and won&rsquo;t walk anywhere w/o a handgun (my state allows this). I have no reservation about shooting anyone bent on doing me bodily harm. If this man isn&rsquo;t going to arm himself he&rsquo;s asking for another beating, or worse. It&rsquo;s called personal responsibility.</p>

<p>As a WN I would get along better with Farrakan than Rush Limbaugh. Farrakan is a Black separatist and I am White separtist. That is why the media byes Farrakan. Of course, good old Rush is just an old fashion race traitor, and a cowardly neocon, who just loves to send White kids to die for our Plutocratic elite masters.</p>
<p>I have said it before and I will say it again. As long as Whites follow so-called conservatives, we are history.<br>

<p>Either of my two highly racist best friends and constant companions, the Rottweiler or the German Shepard would have alerted me to the presence of blacks.  You see, they don&rsquo;t like blacks and aren&rsquo;t afraid to show it, aren&rsquo;t afraid of the word &#8220;racist&#8221; as are humans, but they know a threat when they see one.  At that point, I would have one hand on my gun, the other on the leashes&hellip;or maybe not.</p>

<p>You might want to rent and watch the Charles Bronson movie called Deathwish.<br>
 I am not sure but I think it is still legal to protect yourself from pysical assault in America (At least this week)<br>
 The main character Paul Kersey has some interesting thoughts on justice?<br>
</p>
<p>That wasn&rsquo;t the point of Bronson.  He was willing to kill thugs regardless if it were legal or not.  I&rsquo;d kill someone trying to harm me or my family or some punks hurting an old person.  You need to defend yourself and those you care about at all costs, legal or not.  It&rsquo;s better to be sitting at the defense table than laying in a casket.</p>

<p><br>
Very, very true. Always look behind several times a block when walking.  When you see a black man or boy behind, there is probably 1 ahead to get you in the classic mugger&rsquo;s box.</p>
<p>A sure tip is 3 black men in a car. 1 is the driver.  The other 2 will go after you, 1 behind, the other ahead.</p>
<p>No matter where you are, 3 black men in a car is a danger sign.<br>
Be especialy aware if they are parked at night just sitting there.  They are waiting for someone to go to the ATM or walk to their car.</p>

<p>I once believed Farrakhan wasn&rsquo;t as bad as &#8220;they&#8221; said, too.  After all, if the dominant media culture can lie about us (and they do), why wouldn&rsquo;t they lie about Farrakhan?</p>
<p>After having looked into it, it wasn&rsquo;t hard for me to conclude that Farrakhan isn&rsquo;t one to touch with a 10-foot pole.  First, he really does believe in the test tube and orbiting spaceships malarkey.  Second, if you give him any appreciable power, he will use it to line you and me against the wall.  Third, we&rsquo;re not going to attract more apolitical whites and &#8220;moderate&#8221; whites by publicly throwing in with a white-hating black kook like him.</p>
<p>In spite of all that, I will always have disagreements with Rush Limbaugh and other lamestream conservatives.  I am definitely not one, even though I might agree with it half the time issue by issue.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think Farrakhan burned a candle in fond, loving memory of Qaddafi. That&rsquo;s strange considering that Qaddafi and Farrakhan were practically lovers.</p>
<p>Farraknan&rsquo;s a hypocrite, or maybe he saw how Qaddafi regarded Bantus as mercenaries to keep himself in power.</p>
<p>The first thing the Libyans should do, is toss the Bantus on their ears, from Libya. </p>

		<p>Seems like this older guy doesn&rsquo;t have much common sense&hellip;I agree totally with the poster who says he&rsquo;s a fool if he plans to keep walking in that area without any protection, be it a cane, weapon or big nasty dog. Will Some whites EVER learn that we&rsquo;re dealing with a thug race here?  Took me one time, after having the dubious pleasure of having to live above crackheads in a Southern city (took my poor, long-suffering landlord three months to legally evict them) to legally arm myself.  White liberals may soon be literally a dying species.</p>

<p>That is the most important thing.  Train yourself to check behind you 4 times on every block.  If you see 1 behind and 1 in front, get your gun out.</p>
<p>Especially watch out for 3 black men in a car.  That is the classic team, a driver and 1 in front, 1 in back.</p>
<p>Get a money belt, not one of those ridiculous fanny packs and put in a set of extra keys and keep your wallet in there.  My purse was snatched once by by a black.  He got nothing.  I had keys and money in my pockets.  The purse I usually use was at home with wallet etc.  I grabbed an empty purse out of the hall closet as I went out the door.</p>
<p>All he got was an empty Target purse with a comb in it. Ha ha</p>
<p>A good idea for a woman is to carry a couple plastic supermarket bags in your purse.  After dark or near a black neighborhood, just put the purse in the bag.  Blacks will think you have groceries in the supermarket bag.</p>
<p>If you can carry a gun, know how to use it, practice, rehearse different scenarios if you are attacked in your car or while walking and check out your local laws.</p>
<p>Remember, most goverment workers who will investigate and prosecute shootings are White hating non White affirmative action slugs.</p>
