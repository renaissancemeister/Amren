			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Shyrock, WSFA (Montgomery), October 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Alabama&rsquo;s controversial new immigration law is less than a week old and officials say they&rsquo;ve already made their first arrest for its violation.</p>
<p>A man identified as a Yemeni national was arrested after he could produce no immigration papers. The 24-year-old, Mohamed Ali Muflahi, was taken into custody in Etowah County during a drug raid Friday.</p>
<p>The <em>Gadsden Times</em> newspaper reported that the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office also seized illegal weapons and other items deemed dangerous.</p>
<p>After learning of the arrest, several Alabama state senators drafted a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder demanding the Justice Department drop its legal challenges to the state&rsquo;s immigration law.</p>
<p>{snip} The letter requests that Holder launch an investigation into how a citizen of Yemen settled in Alabama without detection or documentation.</p>

		<p>How did a Yemeni citizen settle in Alabama? Is that your question? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see. The border is wide open, and we don&rsquo;t enforce any regulations that would detect and deport these people, most of which are criminals, or in this guy&rsquo;s case, probably an operative for one Middle East group or another, but let&rsquo;s not say anything, because we might hurt their feelings.</p>
<p>If Uncle Scam doesn&rsquo;t want to control the border, then the States must do it, and there are more than enough people in every State willing to be Deputized to carry out the deportations.</p>

		<p>This might be the first announced arrest based on the law, but I bet it isn&rsquo;t the first literal arrest.  If this is PR positioning on Alabama&rsquo;s part, to announce the arrest of an illegal alien from Yemen days after we took out Al-Alawaki, it&rsquo;s really clever PR.</p>

		<p>Latest update is that he was in fact here legally. If thats true then IMO thats even worse. After they arrested this Yemeni thug - Mohamed Ali Muflahi - they found &#8220;illegal weapons and other items deemed dangerous&#8221;! In a sane world just his name alone would&rsquo;ve kept him out of the country. And, upon arresting him, they had to arrest two of his Yemini friends for &#8220;obstructing a government operation&#8221;, and they turned out to be legal also! How were these thugs allowed to be here legally or illegally? Thats what bothers me.  </p>

		<p>The Big Conservative Pushback begins in earnest.  </p>
<p>Libs are ringing their hands over the capacity of elected officials to pass laws that actually are intended to help White Humanity.  Look for more strident calls to &#8220;make elections less significant&hellip; elections shouldn&rsquo;t mean so much&hellip; we should postpone the next election so Congress can concentrate on its work&hellip; we should allow elections to hold us hostage to extremist, right wing and racist Tea Partiers&hellip; we need to minimize the harm from legislative inertia by relying more on automatic policies and depoliticized commissions for certain policy decisions&hellip; we need to counter the gridlock of our political institutions by making them a bit less democratic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Libs must double down. There&rsquo;s no going back now to a softer, gentler approach, which is only possible during times of prosperity when folks are too busy working and investing in the future to pay attention to how the Libs are stealing the future.</p>
<p>What can Libs do other than suspend elections?  The cat is out of the bag, and White Humanity no longer believes it should suffer for the sake of the blacks and browns.  Libs can&rsquo;t fall back on slogans and compassion. They must march that next step straight toward Tyranny.  That&rsquo;s their only option to control us now. They&rsquo;ll do it, too. Always have, always will.</p>
<p>What they won&rsquo;t allow will be Tea Partiers holding the DOJ accountable for anything.  Did you see the Hannity Interview of Chris Adams last night re his new book Injustice that exposes the &#8220;radicalized racialism&#8221; of the Holder DOJ?   It sounded like a litany of White Nationalist complaints against the modern Affirmative Action regime.  We are making progress at &#8220;mainstreaming hate&#8221; as the SPLC calls it, but look for the media to make sure you think of Hitler and David Duke every time you hear Chris Adams&rsquo; name from now on.</p>
<p>DOJ will use the &#8220;inciting racial hatred&#8221; over at at FoxNews as cover to ignore Alabama&rsquo;s demands re the arrest of the Muslim from Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just can&rsquo;t give in to hate!&#8221;</p>
<p>In loving memory of Anthony Jacobs:</p>
<p>transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip; you see it in your worst nightmares&hellip; and you are extremely right!</p>
<p>Anthony Jacobs could possible still be alive?  He was middle aged in 1965.  Maybe he&rsquo;s 99 years old and hiding out with William Gayle Simpson?  Who knows where he is?<br>

		<p>If I was a middle eastern man who also just happened to be an illegal immigrant, the last place in the world I would want to be is Alabama. He must not have done too much research. They seem to turn up in the strangest places though. I live in a predominately white area, and it has been that way for several hundred years. I am now seeing middle eastern people in public quite frequently, and many of them are not speaking English. This is a pretty economically depressed area, you have got to wonder why they are coming here. </p>

		<p>why isn&rsquo;t the rest of the U.S. protecting their own borders with a state volunteer militia? Here in Az. they are discussing this and each state has the right to protect and defend it&rsquo;s borders, if the government does&rsquo;nt have the capability or desire to. nobama is trying his hardest for amnesty(you know, amnesty like he gave to his sister and drunken uncle) and the safety of the American citizen is not at the top of his list of priorities.<br>

		<p> The fact that he is middle eastern reinforces my opinion that so called homeland security isn&rsquo;t here to protect us as much as it&rsquo;s here to force us into line with PC racial opinion. We simply cannot have any opinion that violates anyones constitutional right to take over our country. We have to hire people based on skin color and soon will suffer discrimination by the non whites simply because they work cheaper and get away with it. I&rsquo;m not in favor of any bias toward anyone yet cannot fail to see the double standard at work in immigration and elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Look for more veiled threats from the left about black violence.  Fools that liberals are, they&rsquo;re only beginning to realize that they&rsquo;re preaching to the choir with their plaints about the Tea Party, racism, and poor black and brown folks.  Are the vast majority of white Americans afraid of the Tea Party?  Are they wringing their hands because toilet paper is white or because blacks and Hispanics aren&rsquo;t receiving enough welfare?  About the only thing remaining for leftists is to hint that blacks will riot if Obama isn&rsquo;t reelected.  Of course, the behavior of lawless blacks has gotten increasingly worse since his election, leading sensible people to conclude that it will worsen still if he stays in office.  One way or another, we&rsquo;re probably going to have to deal with ghetto uprisings.  Do we want to have a big blowout for a day or two around the elections or four more years of increasing insurrection?</p>

		<p>It looks like a neo-con anti-Arab interpretation. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. They should never have forced that Arab and Muslim invasion on us. The 1st ammendment does not require Muslim immigration! </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see if they really apply it to the hordes of Mexicans taking our jobs, lowering wages, joining armed gangs,and costing billions in social and law enforcement services! </p>

<p>Your post was excellent until that last bit about &#8220;They&rsquo;ll do it, too. Always have, always will.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they won&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t really think you&rsquo;re defeatist, because your post was written in what appeared to be an optimistic, determined mood.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t thik the Libtards will succeed in much of anything anymore, going forward for the forseeable future. Why? They&rsquo;re effete, weak people. They are incapable of using effective physical force. That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to need soon. These are the pansies of the world.  The blacks and browns they wanted to use as enablers, are going to instead crush the pansies, whilst crushing each other.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just sit back and watch, smile, and enjoy.</p>

<p>I vote for the short, sharp uprising. I think it WILL happen on the evening of Obama&rsquo;s total blowout in November 2012.</p>

<p>SERIOUSLY, AmRen, we have to foster some real ambition here, something positive; we KNOW the toilet we&rsquo;re standing in. Let&rsquo;s stop encouraging all the whining.</p>
