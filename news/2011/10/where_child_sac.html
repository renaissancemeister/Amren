<h1><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15255357">Where Child Sacrifice Is a Business</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Rogers, BBC, October 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The villages and farming communities that surround Uganda&rsquo;s capital, Kampala, are gripped by fear.</p>
<p>Schoolchildren are closely watched by teachers and parents as they make their way home from school. In playgrounds and on the roadside are posters warning of the danger of abduction by witch doctors for the purpose of child sacrifice.</p>
<p>The ritual, which some believe brings wealth and good health, was almost unheard of in the country until about three years ago, but it has re-emerged, seemingly alongside a boom in the country&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>The mutilated bodies of children have been discovered at roadsides, the victims of an apparently growing belief in the power of human sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Sacrifice business&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Many believe that members of the country&rsquo;s new elite are paying witch doctors vast sums of money for the sacrifices in a bid to increase their wealth.</p>
<p>At the Kyampisi Childcare Ministries church, Pastor Peter Sewakiryanga is teaching local children a song called Heal Our Land, End Child Sacrifice.</p>
<p>To hear dozens of young voices singing such shocking words epitomises how ritual murder has become part of everyday life here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child sacrifice has risen because people have become lovers of money. They want to get richer,&#8221; the pastor says.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a belief that when you sacrifice a child you get wealth, and there are people who are willing to buy these children for a price. So they have become a commodity of exchange, child sacrifice has become a commercial business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pastor and his parishioners are lobbying the government to regulate witch doctors and improve police resources to investigate these crimes.</p>
<p>According to official police figures, there was one case of child sacrifice in 2006; in 2008 the police say they investigated 25 alleged ritual murders, and in 2009, another 29.</p>
<p>The Anti-Human Sacrifice Police Task Force, launched in response to the growing numbers, says the ritual murder rate has slowed, citing a figure of 38 cases since 2006.</p>
<p>Pastor Sewakiryanga disputes the police numbers, and says there are more victims from his parish than official statistics for the entire country.</p>
<p>The work of the police task force has been strongly criticised by the UK-based charity, Jubilee Campaign.</p>
<p>It says in a report that the true number of cases is in the hundreds, and claims more than 900 cases have yet to be investigated by the police because of corruption and a lack of resources.</p>
<p><strong><strong>&#8216;Quiet money&rsquo;</strong></strong></p>
<p>Tepenensi led me to a field near her home where she found the body of her six-year-old grandson Stephen, dumped in the reeds. She trembled as she pointed out the spot where she found his decapitated body; he had been missing for 24 hours.</p>
<p>Clutching the only photo she has of her grandson, Tepenensi sobbed as she explained that although the local witch doctor had admitted to sacrificing Stephen, the police were reluctant to pursue the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;They offered me money to keep quiet,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I refused the offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>No-one from the Ugandan government agreed to do an interview. The police deny inaction and corruption.</p>
<p>The head of the Anti-Human Sacrifice Police Task Force, Commissioner Bignoa Moses, says the police are doing all they can to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, they accuse us of these things because we make no arrests, but we are limited. If we get information that someone is involved in criminal activities like human sacrifice, we shall go and investigate, and if it can be proven we will take him to court, but sometimes the cases are not proven.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Boy castrated<br>
</strong><br>
At Kampala main hospital, consultant neurosurgeon Michael Muhumuza shows me the X-rays of the horrific injuries suffered by nine-year-old Allan.</p>
<p>They reveal missing bone from his skull and damage to a part of his brain after a machete sliced through Allan&rsquo;s head and neck in an attempt to behead him; he was castrated by the witch doctor. It was a month before Allan woke from a coma after being dumped near his village home.</p>
<p>Allan was able to identify his attackers, including a man called Awali. But the police say Allan&rsquo;s eyewitness account is unreliable.</p>
<p>Local people told us that Awali continues to be involved with child sacrifice.</p>
<p>For our own inquiries, we posed as local businessmen and asked around for a witch doctor that could bring prosperity to our local construction company. We were soon introduced to Awali. He led us into a courtyard behind his home, and as if to welcome us he and his helpers wrestled a goat to the ground and slit its throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This animal has been sacrificed to bring luck to us all,&#8221; Awali explained. He then demanded a fee of $390 (Â£250) for the ritual and asked us to return in a few days.</p>
<p>At our next meeting, Awali invited us into his shrine, which is traditionally built from mud bricks with a straw roof. Inside, the floor is littered with herbs, face masks, rattles and a machete.</p>
<p>The witch doctor explained that this meeting was to discuss the most powerful spell  &mdash;  the sacrifice of a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two ways of doing this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can bury the child alive on your construction site, or we cut them in different places and put their blood in a bottle of spiritual medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awali grabbed his throat. &#8220;If it&rsquo;s a male, the whole head is cut off and his genitals. We will dig a hole at your construction site, and also bury the feet and the hands and put them all together in the hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awali boasted he had sacrificed children many times before and knew what he was doing. After this meeting, we withdrew from the negotiations.</p>
<p>We handed our notes to the police. Awali is still a free man.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;No voice&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Allan&rsquo;s father, Semwanga, has sold his home to pay for Allan&rsquo;s medical treatment, and moved to the slums near the capital.</p>
<p>Sitting on the steps of their makeshift house, built from corrugated sheets of metal, I showed the footage of our meeting with the witch doctor to Allan on my laptop. He pointed to the screen and shouted &#8220;Awali!&#8221; confirming he is the man who attacked him.</p>
<p>Pastor Sewakiryanga says without the full force of the law, there is little that can be done to protect Uganda&rsquo;s children from the belief in the power of human sacrifice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The children do not have voices, their voices have been silenced by the law and the police not acting, and the people who read the newspapers do nothing, so we have to make a stand and do whatever it takes to stamp out this evil, we can only pray that the government will listen.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so strange abou this. Aren&rsquo;t generations of whites sacrificing their own children on the alter of Diversity? Haven&rsquo;t we been doing so for generations now? At least these people are out in the open about it!</p>

		<p>Knowing Whiteys as well as we all do, look for more Whitey missionaries to flock to Uganda, with their wives and children in tow, to &#8220;spread the message of hope and love through outreach to the poor, suffering African victims of global White racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Diversity Curse seeks us all, but it most easily reaches those who almost most deserve it.  Those who most deserve it, college presidents, trustees, philanthropists, government workers, rich bishops, etc., protect themselves behind gated communities and lifetime pension plans, plus health care.<br>

		<p>I caught the sad story of Allan on BBC America last night. Now the multiculti leftists will try and convince us that all cultures are equally valid, but how can anyone not consider abduction and killing small children in pursuit of wealth anything but evil?  It won&rsquo;t be long until we read of White children being kidnapped by Congoids and murdered in N. America, Europe, or AZ/NZ. I would imagine that in the mind of a primitive sacrificing the most desirable children will create the most wealth. I would not be surprised if such a killing has already happened (I know of the case from the UK with a refugee kid), but the MSM and the authorities would not be inclined to reveal such horrors to the public. I was surprised the BBC would even report on this. I thought all Africans were morally superior to us lowly Whites?</p>

		<p>&#8220;They have a belief that when you sacrifice a child you get wealth&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t suppose it matters to these pinheads that this obviously isn&rsquo;t true. That no correlation has ever been demonstrated between castrating and/or beheading a young boy and picking a winning lottery ticket or otherwise &#8220;hitting it big.&#8221; </p>
<p>What is such a stupid and vicious superstition even BASED on? How does an idea like this even STARTED? I mean, I know Bantu brainpower isn&rsquo;t exactly top-of-the-line, but even people with 70 IQ ought to be able to figure out that child-sacrifice-as-get-rich-quick-scheme is a very big no-no. <br>

		<p>Wow.  Just when you think it can&rsquo;t get any more absurdly horrific in subsaharan Africa&hellip;</p>
<p>WRONG!  </p>
<p>It can always get more absurdly horrific in subsaharan Africa.  That&rsquo;s my new rule, like Occams Razor, or Godwin&rsquo;s Law - It can always get more absurdly horrific in subsaharan Africa.</p>

		<p>Strangely enough the PC riddled BBC has managed to let slip a report about the truth about African life and human anthropology.<br>
  No doubt the purpose of the story was to raise alarm/sympathy and not awaken the public to the truth about genetic propensities.</p>

		<p>Wow, as if we need any more evidence- ever- to justify the inferiority of Africans and their &#8220;cultures&#8221;. I&rsquo;ve wanted an absolute moratorium on African immigration to the US for a while now, and in light of anecdotes like this one, how could any sane person argue against me? Oh, the multicultural left would find some reality bending way to except the majority of &#8220;good and noble&#8221; Africans from this sort of thing, but the fact is that cities like New York and London which have large African immigrant populations have been quietly dealing with cases of suspected child sacrifice for years. Of course, such new items get round-filed along with incidents of black-on-white hate crimes and flash mobs. Got to keep giving the poor oppressed Africans the benefit of the doubt, after all, if it weren&rsquo;t for our oppression of them creating such bad circumstances for them, then they would just be the best of people. With their 70 IQs and penchant for savage violence.</p>
<p>As an aside, really liking &#8220;Neanderthal&rsquo;s Constant,&#8221; good one.</p>

<p><br>
I&rsquo;d never heard of this, so I googled it. </p>
<p>Apparently, in the mid-19th C, some Xhosa girl in South Africa claimed visions of dead ancestors. The local witch-doctor confirmed her hallucinations as prophecy of a great Utopia just on the horizon, where dead loved ones would return, cattle would be superabundant, and the hated white man would be defeated. But first, the tribe&rsquo;s spiritual leader said, they would have to destroy all their current cattle and crops   &mdash;   presumably to make room for all the new, improved cattle and crops that this Bantu version of the Rapture would soon bring them. Needless to say, the Glorious Day never came, and 100,000 Xhosa starved to death. Those who didn&rsquo;t sought charity food from the Brits and the Boers   &mdash;   the same people they were planning on genociding right after Great Spirit in Sky had replaced their old cows. </p>
<p>As mass-suicides go, this makes what Jim Jones and his 700 followers did down in Guyana seem comparatively sensible and purposeful. At least the Jonestown kool-aid drinkers were convinced that they were committing (in Jones&rsquo; words) &#8220;a Revolutionary act&#8221;; whereas the Xhosa killed themselves basically on a hunch. </p>
<p>The ever-so-PC Wikipedia makes no mention of the mass-suicide in their &#8220;Xhosa&#8221; listing   &mdash;   the college girls who edit that thing are no doubt downplaying the wacky events because they make the tribe look kind of, um, dumb   &mdash;   but there is an account of it in the listing for &#8220;History of Cape Colony from 1806 to 1870&#8221;:</p>

		<p>Everyone (and I do mean EVERYONE) should watch the following documentary I caught on &#8220;National Geographic Channel&#8221; about the contemporary butchering of Whites in Uganda (of course suppressed by the international, controlled disinfo media).

		<p>Child sacrifice is nothing new, after all western governments sacrfice the lives and futures of white children on the altar of &#8220;die-versity.&#8221; Look how many white children die each year in the U.S. due to illegal aliens driving drunk for example.</p>

		<p>During the European slave trade the vast majority of black slaves were enslaved by other blacks, and sold to the white slave traders. Until the development of modern medicine the interior of Africa was lethal to European whites.<br>
 <br>
Black slaves who were not sold to the whites were often the victims of human sacrifice and cannibalism. </p>
