<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The percentage of foreign-born U.S. residents with deep roots in the country is rising and will continue to soar in the coming decades, a USC analysis released Thursday shows.</p>
<p>The percentage of foreign-born residents who have lived in the United States at least 20 years climbed from 30.4 percent of the foreign-born population in 2000 to an estimated 38.5 percent in 2010, according to the report.</p>
<p>The report, published by the Population Dynamics Research Group at USC, forecasts that by 2030 the majority of foreign-born residents  &mdash;  or 52.6 percent  &mdash;  will have resided in the U.S. for at least two decades, laying the basis for stronger social, economic and civic ties among the foreign-born population as they assimilate, the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} These estimates provide information not available in the 2010 Census, the first census in over a century that did not record residents&rsquo; place of birth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The percentage of those living in the United States who are foreign-born or children of immigrants will jump from 22.5 percent in 2010 to 30.5 percent by 2040, according to the projection.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a level that hasn&rsquo;t been reached since 1930, the report says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other findings of the report, &#8220;Projections of the U.S. Population, 2010-2040, by Immigrant Generation and Foreign Born Duration in the U.S.,&#8221; include:</p>
<p>-The total U.S. population is predicted to hit 391.1 million in 2040, a number 13 million below the latest projection issued in 2008 by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>-Rates of annual immigration, which slowed during the Great Recession, are not expected to return to the peak levels experienced in 2000. Net immigration, estimated to be less than 1 million in 2009, is projected to rise to 1.18 million in 2015 and 1.25 million in 2025. Pitkin and Myers convened a panel of leading national demographic and economic experts to forecast the annual immigration rate.</p>

		<p>All these stats are faulty.  There are currently 340,+ million people in the US - RIGHT NOW.  310 million officially, and 340 million total, including 30 million illegal aliens.  The 30 million MUST be included in any stats.  And there are AT LEAST 30 million.  I&rsquo;ve driven in at least half of all the states and there are almost as many Mexicans as Blacks.  (There are over 35 million Blacks) Considering the rate that all non-Whites reproduce and the fact that the rate of both illegal and legal immigration is increasing, and also considering that it took 44 years for the population of the US to increase 70%, it is obvious that it is not going to take another 44 years for the US population to increase another 70%.  When the population (both legal residents and illegal gets to over 400 million, we - Whites - will then be a minority.  And all the population has to do is increase another 18%.  (The White population is not currently increasing, but decreasing due to the low White birthrate)  The real truth is that WE WILL BE A MINORITY IN ABOUT 10-15 YEARS.</p>

		<p>The Civil War II will be between White Americans and our new non white overlords.  The federal government decided to elect a new people and dilute America&rsquo;s founding stock. When we are the minority, we will be subjected to the worst demonization imaginable, and stoking hate and violence against us will become a contest between our factionalized enemies.</p>
<p>We will not obey laws passed by bodies who were elected by Mexican anchor babies and illegal aliens.  We&rsquo;ve seen what kind of government we get from Freed Africanisms, and we won&rsquo;t tolerate worse.</p>
<p>Folks, it&rsquo;s bad, you know. </p>

		<p>&#8216;as they assimilate&rsquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem, they never do fully assimilate. They assimilate to the extent that they take full advantage of all the economic opportunities they can at the expense of Natural Born Americans. Indians and Pakistanis especially seem to have the deepest pockets and seemingly endless supplies of cash. And it is no secret that they are helped along by special loans and grants courtesy of the feds. Hispanics take advantage of the fact that many of their peers have moved into the service related industries and are the first pick to fill job openings. Regardless of how rich they become or how long they have been here they never loose their national identities even when and if they naturalize.</p>
<p>We are- at least our government is- signing our own death warrant. These people have doubtful loyalties to this country. The enemy is literally being let in through the front door and when they get in through the back door they can live here happily ever after. The owner of a hotel I have done some work for and who happens to be a Pakistani and owns at least four other units thinks that Americans are stupid. Most Hispanics will tell you they are taking over. With with the potential for a large percentage of these foreign born to produce instant new citizens we are headed for a political train wreck.  </p>
<p>If these trends continue unabated there is no hope for the survival of our race or this country. With the socialist march through the institutions, the indoctrination of our children and<br>
self centered politicos who only profit from the power of public office. It is only a matter of time.<br>

		<p> Don&rsquo;t you just love how these &#8220;leading national demographic and economic experts&#8221; blithely assume that immigration trends are as immuatable as the tides of the sea. If an indefinite moratorium on immigration and AZ/AL type laws were enacted nationally these predictions wouldn&rsquo;t come to pass. At the moment, things keep getting worse and worse. But something&rsquo;s gotta give sooner or later. You can only import so many dimwhitted third worlders before everything collapses. </p>

		<p>P.S. to my previous comment.<br>
In the news today:</p>
<p>The FBI and the DEA have disrupted a plot involving Iran to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States </p>
<p>and commit other attacks, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Two men - one arrested, the other at large - have been charged in connection with the plot, which the Justice Department says was directed by elements of the Iranian government.</p>
<p>The Justice Department says one of the men – Manssor Arbabsiar, a naturalized U.S. citizen holding an Iranian passport – arranged to hire for the assassination someone in Mexico who he thought was an associate of a drug trafficking cartel. The person in Mexico actually was a DEA confidential source who was posing as a cartel associate, the Justice Department says.</p>
<p>Ah the wonders of dual citizenship and third world immigration. Need I say more?</p>

		<p>No man can serve two masters and these Americans with deep roots else where are not Americans.  Here in NJ I am already the minoroty and with the number of white woman with black babies and white men (and even white woman) with Oriental spouses I don&rsquo;t hold out much hope.</p>

<p>Republicans use that phrase all the time..Assimilation is their answer to 3rd world immigrants and have the illegals apply for citizenship is their solution to the &#8220;illegal&#8221; problem.. They are NUTS and I want nothing to do with any Republican again. I used to think they were on the &#8220;white&#8221; side, but that changed about 30 years ago.

		<p>Its hard to tell what&rsquo;s going to happem to us (whites) in the future. Non-whites will always use us as a scapegoat for sure. That is a given. </p>
<p>I think we will start to become a much poorer country in the next 10 years, and that will slow down immigration. From there, the US will become a divided country just getting along. Some traditional American states and ones that are successful will try to break away from the union, and much resources will be spent to keep it together.</p>
<p>We will loose PR, Guam and maybe Alaska. The southern states will try to gain more independance if they&rsquo;re forced to stay in the union. </p>
<p>Non-whites will run the country and drive it into the ground little by little. Whites had built a great country but the others deep down know that - and resent it.</p>

		<p>In 2040 we won&rsquo;t have to worry about race.<br>
Either we&rsquo;ve won since way back or we&rsquo;re all so genetically modified (or at that point more robotic) that it won&rsquo;t matter. The timeline that matters is the next 15 years. And Peak Oil will be the main driver of events.</p>
<p>In 2025, racial differences will easily be able to be bridged through nanogenetics. That&rsquo;s if we have a civilization left standing. And in 2025, if we don&rsquo;t, then the world will likely be in ruins. </p>
<p>Either way, the &#8216;2040&rsquo; analysis is totally unnecessary. <br>
The fate of the West will be decided in these next 15 years, no later.</p>

There is no evidence that there are 30 million illegals.  That&rsquo;s pure speculation on your part.  There have been more Hispanics than blacks in the US for quite some time now as per the official statistics.  No need for 30 million illegals to account for that.  </p>

		<p>#4 anonymous makes a good point that immigration is being treated as an &#8220;immutable&#8221; force of nature. It&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s the direct result of policies that have been enacted against the will of the majority. Most people do NOT support the immigration policies that are creating these changes. </p>
<p>Therefore, the question should be   &mdash;   how can the policy of a democratic republic not represent the will of the majority? And that really is the question, now, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Returning now to the &#8220;immutable&#8221; force of nature, immigration may not be an &#8220;immutable&#8221; force of nature. But the consequences of immigration are. The consequences of allowing millions of low IQ, uneducated peasants to immigrate will be a lower standard of living and conflict. And THAT is an &#8220;immutable&#8221; force of nature.</p>

<p>I admire your attitude, but we have to face reality.  We - Whites - are now 2nd Class citizens in our own country.  And sometime soon, as Jared Taylor says, we are going to be a hated and hunted minority, if we don&rsquo;t wake up.  In many places or most places in the U.S. they ARE our overlords in a very real sense.  Their rights come first and ours second.</p>

<p>Wrong. Do you perhaps belong to the CoC? There&rsquo;s plenty of evidence.</p>
<p>https://www.capsweb.org/content.php?id=57</p>
<p>Four experts who contributed to the 45-page study explained their findings that illegal aliens in the U.S. total at least 20 million, but perhaps as many as 38 million or more   &mdash;   which far exceeds 8 to 12 million estimated by Homeland Security&rsquo;s Office of Immigration Studies new report, &#8220;Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States, January 2006&#8221; (released August 31, 2007, see https://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics . The new study disputing the government figures was funded by Californians for Population Stabilization (CAPS) (www.capsweb.org) and published by The Social Contract Press (www.thesocialcontract.com). </p>

<p>Hey LOOK around! Speculation? when they have been saying for a couple of decades now that there are only 12 million?  I suppose the numbers never grew since then, huh? In CA alone and in my city there are at least 10 million! I will bet just by mathematical calculations from 2 decades ago, that there are at least 40 million illegals by now&hellip;. Don&rsquo;t forget to count all those &#8220;anchor babies&#8221;&hellip;They are ILLEGAL also no matter what they try to say. </p>

		<p><i>The FBI and the DEA have disrupted a plot involving Iran to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States.</i></p>
<p>With all due respect, the sudden announcement of a &#8220;take down&#8221; that happened over two weeks ago is suspect.  The entire plot is too sloppy to have been conducted by Iranian ops, if the quds wanted the ambassador dead, he would be dead.</p>
<p>What possible reason would the Iranians have to risk turning their country into a toxic waste dump by the wrath of the US military?</p>
<p>The timing is suspect too   &mdash;   break this now to get Fast and Furious and Solyndra off of the front pages and just as Issa issues a subpoena to Holder.  Let Holder make the announcement so he looks like a responsible AG and savior of the world.</p>

		<p>To my eyes, this article is so in-your-face.  It&rsquo;s as if it says &#8220;Nya nanny boo boo&#8221; while sticking out its tongue and putting it&rsquo;s thumbs in its ears a la that taunting school playground gesture.  It tells me, &#8220;accept it&hellip;twenty years means these people are now assimilated and care about this country, and they are hear to stay, and more are coming.  DEAL WITH IT&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, I say, bullhockeys.  My family has been here since at least 1738 and there are few enough of them that care about this country.  But at least we no longer speak Gaelic, French, or German.  We don&rsquo;t get special loans or giveaways to open our motels or shops.  We don&rsquo;t receive Section 8 housing or any other benefit.  </p>
<p>And what is ironic is that once we become the minority, we STILL won&rsquo;t receive anything.  And we all know why.</p>

		<p>If you look at the people screaming &#8220;racist&#8221; loudest when someone protests our misguided immigration policies   &mdash;   these screamers invariably are liberals. This country does NOT need endless immigration! We, as a nation, cannot support a continuously growing immigrant population. What worked well between 1865 and 1965 is no longer workable. The jobs are not there; the economy simply cannot sustain unchecked immigration. </p>
<p>The reality is that every job held by an immigrant   &mdash;   is a job lost to an American!</p>

		<p>With respect to the invasion of illegal immigrants from Latin America   &mdash;   it must be pointed out that while these illegals generally work at unskilled, manual labor jobs   &mdash;   their eventual adult anchor babies will be competing against legitimate Americans for ever scarcer jobs!</p>

		<p>Responding to ATBOTL:</p>
<p>The actual number of illegal immigrants in our country is not even known to the Federal government! That was admitted more than once in newspaper articles attributed to government officials.</p>
<p>That something like a million illegal border-jumpers enter our nation yearly was also a point in published newspaper articles. Extrapolating that the present rate of immigration has pretty well been constant for the last thirty years   &mdash;   you have your 30 MILLION illegals. Truth, of course, being that the number of illegals is probably substantially HIGHER than the projected 30 million.</p>
<p>That illegal immigrants generally refuse to answer census questions; that Latinos rarely report illegal aliens known to them   &mdash;   is also a bleak reality.</p>
<p>Yet another realty is that while Blacks are outnumbered roughly 2-to-1 by Latinos, the two racial groups are pretty well TIED respective to the TOTAL percentage of criminals in each racial group. Apparently Blacks really DO work hard   &mdash;   even if only at committing crimes.</p>

		<p>What the U.S., Europe, in fact the entire West has going is a form of the Hapsburg Empire.  It was unmanageable and led to two world wars.  </p>
<p>In a far more populous world, international conflagration would be far more devastating than the first half of the 20th century. One of today&rsquo;s news stories for example, is about how the U.S. is not prepared - anywhere near prepared for public health disasters, pandemics, or national emergencies.</p>
<p>Among other preparations, all race realists should school up on first aid, and even further,even if you just mean to take care of yourselves and those near you. </p>
<p>I agree with #10 Anon; we will see this within 15 years. It is normal to project things far out enough to calm people in the here and now, and I am not suggesting we panic. I am suggesting that we prepare and watch.</p>

<p>Right on the money. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been talking all the time. By 2040 (or so), the dominant- or dominating- human form will have been a cyborgized man built on- I surmise- White man&rsquo;s psycho-physical blueprint, with possible smaller elements from other races &amp; especially new &#8220;Terminatoresque&#8221; ingredients (artificial hips, bones, perhaps better tissue in various parts of the body &amp; more potent brain). This is not a sci-fi rambling, but- I&rsquo;m convinced- a very probable future reality.</p>
<p>But, what in the meantime ? I agree that the crucial period will be next 10-20 yrs, when both genetic engineering, biomechanics &amp; nano-genotechnology will inevitably clash with liberal dogmas of social engineering &amp; forced racial uniformity. I believe that the grand lie will collapse, just like the Communist one- yet, what awaits the European races in the near future is some kind of purgatory. Hard times.</p>

		<p>Bardon #24: I advocate the end of abortion, or of White abortion, anyway. </p>
<p>This outrage has been directed at White women by the Marxists who spin lies to our sisters and daughters about being &#8220;Career women&#8221; all the while telling these women that motherhood is a prison, and babies are their Jailers.</p>
<p>For those young White women who are expecting a White baby, and the father cannot, or will not, step up and take his share of the responsibility, then it is up to us to contribute what we can to the full term birth, medical care, and food that the baby will need, along with other necessities such as diapers, clothes, and shoes. </p>
<p>These White women have to know that there is a support system for them, Nation wide, that will assist them and their children to grow to a healthy maturity. </p>
<p>Often, the women&rsquo;s families are not in the finacial situation to give the support they would like to. That&rsquo;s where we should step in.</p>
<p>I loath abortion as being the destruction of what GOD created, but if we are going to complain about future demographics, and our own Racial demise, then I would also suggest that we take an active part in doing something about it; and this is a giant step in the right direction. </p>
