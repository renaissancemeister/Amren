			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Deborah Linchesky, EurekAlert, October 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Less than half of pediatric car passengers suffering injuries from motor vehicle crashes were restrained, with the lowest rates among blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans, according to a research abstract presented Saturday, Oct. 15, at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) National Conference and Exhibition (NCE) in Boston.</p>
<p>While motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children, there is little data regarding the racial/ethnic differences in injury severity, use of seat belts and outcomes. In the study, &#8220;Are There Racial/Ethnic Disparities in the Use of Restraints and Outcomes in Children Following Motor Vehicle Crashes?&#8221; researchers reviewed 2002-2006 data from the National Trauma Database on car accidents involving nearly 40,000 children under age 16. Specifically, the study authors looked at the race/ethnicity of the children, whether or not they wore a seat belt, and the severity of their injury as determined by the need for emergency surgery, length of hospital stay, and morbidity/mortality.</p>
<p>Overall, 47.5 percent of patients were restrained, with the lowest use of seat belts among black, Hispanic and Native American children. Of the children injured, 12.6 percent required an emergency operation. Overall morbidity was 6.7 percent; and mortality, 5.8 percent. While race/ethnicity did not affect mortality or length of hospital stay, the use of restraints was associated with a lower injury severity score (ISS). A higher ISS was associated with an increased need for emergency surgery, morbidity (severe outcome), death and longer hospital stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;After adjusting for the use of restraints, we found no differences in mortality among different ethnic groups. The major determinant of both morbidity and mortality is the severity of the injury as quantified by the initial injury severity score,&#8221; said lead study author Rebecca Stark, MD. &#8220;Because the use of restraints decreases the ISS, we feel our results highlight the need for further education and outreach to the pediatric population about the benefit of seat belt use.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Once a week the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles gives away booster seats to anyone who shows up.  Interesting fact, the consulate is located right next door to one of the largest welfare offices in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>So it is not the cost of the booster seats. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s still another circular argument in a liberal-oriented article.  Whatever!  What cannot and will not even be hinted at, however, is the lack of care often allotted to black, Hispanic, and Native American children.  The incredibly high abortion rate among black women is good indicator, for example.  In NYC, it&rsquo;s almost 3/4, and the nation at large has a rate of half.  Child abuse is so prevalent among blacks that a nightly TV show could highlight nothing else and still have to pick among the many incidents that occur.  </p>

		<p>Now, in this twisted world, we should shortly see litigation against auto manufac. because of this &#8216;statistic&rsquo;&hellip;they are racists because their product leads to death/injury in a disproportionate amount of &#8216;minority&rsquo; children. In a word, the seatbelts do not automatically restrain the above, because they, nor their parents, think to do so for them or themselves. Yes, &#8216;automatic&rsquo; seatbelts (they made them in the past-fail) will become mandatory&hellip;probably.</p>

		<p>Law enforcement keeps lobbying state legislatures to change seat belt violations from secondary to primary, but the various black cauci keep pushing back, because they&rsquo;re worried about &#8220;racial&#8221; profiling.  What they&rsquo;re worried about is that they&rsquo;re worried the cop will pull over a car full of kids obviously not wearing seat belts, and find the driver has numerous outstanding warrants and/or several kilos of weed in the trunk.</p>

		<p>Minorities can&rsquo;t drive either,(drunk or sober).  That is one other reason more minority kids are hurt in more accidents. Problem is they hurt more Whites in those accidents they cause.</p>

<p>Translation:  We desperately need federal, local and state funding for an advocacy program.  We will hire hispanic illegal immigrants and blacks too stupid to get an affirmative action goverment job to advocate, counsel and advocate that the parents of these kids use car seats and seat belts.</p>
<p>The program of course will go on forever and the great grandchildren of these kids will still need counseling, advocating and educating in the use of seat belts and car seats.</p>

		<p>More &#8220;education&#8221; and &#8220;outreach???&#8221;  Who doesn&rsquo;t know that wearing a seatbelt in an automoble is not only a safety precaution, but the LAW as well? I&rsquo;ve worn a belt since before it was law - it is common sense, and has saved my skin in a serious accident to boot. </p>
<p>Next Blacks will need to be told that smoking is unhealthy, or that jumping off a cliff isn&rsquo;t a great life choice. God, what a race of overgrown children&hellip; </p>

		<p>Why would you expect Blacks, Hispanics and Amerindians to obey seatbelt laws when they ignore all the other ones?</p>
<p>The kicker is that they tend to suffer more serious injuries than whites would in similar crashes meaning they add yet more unnecessary costs to our health care system.</p>

		<p>Next on the News:  Those who designed seatbelts are racist because they did not take into account minorities will not be as prone to wear them as whites.</p>
<p>We need to redesign seatbelts to have bling and shiny objects on them along with pics of obese white women to cater to them.</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t work say it&rsquo;s a part of the legacy of slavery.  Even tough my all four of my grandparents were born in Europe and my family has had no connections to the U.S. before the 1940s I am guilty because I am white.</p>

		<p>This is another one of those topics that falls under the category of &#8220;Everyone knows this by now&#8221; and more outreach and education will not fix inherent stupidity and irresponsibility.  If they really wanted to fix up the numbers they should begin charging the drivers with negligent homicide or manslaughter whenever this happens.</p>

		<p>When I was a Probation Officer I often had to drive the criminals around town.  It was always the same.  We&rsquo;d get in the car.  I&rsquo;d start the car.  I&rsquo;d tell them to put on their seat belt.</p>
<p>They never just buckled up.  They&rsquo;d start babbling about how dangerous seat belts were because in case the car exploded they would be buckled in.  Unbuckling would take too much time.</p>
<p>Rather than argue I&rsquo;d just turn off the ignition and tell them we weren&rsquo;t going anywhere until they buckled up.</p>
<p>They always did.  But most of the time I had to listen to how dangerous seat belts are if the car explodes.</p>

		<p>Another legacy of the de industrialization of America and college for everyone in lieu of work.</p>
<p>The only jobs available any more are either service, food, teaching, medicine or telling other people what to do.</p>
<p>This is just a plea for goverment funds paying people to tell other people what to do.  It will be a nice office job for middle aged nurses wanting to get out of bedside care.  Of course the nurses will all be black and hispanic.</p>
<p>The raw materials of the black economy are disfunctional blacks.<br>
All those goverment, education and non profit affirmative action jobs are just Whites paying blacks to deal with black disfunction.</p>
