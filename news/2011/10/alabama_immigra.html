			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Naeesa Aziz, BET, October 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-American and Latino community leaders in Alabama came together Saturday in an effort to unite the two communities against the state&rsquo;s new strict immigration law that they say is tantamount to terrorizing immigrants.</p>
<p>In a rally titled, Alabama United: One Family, One Alabama, community members held hands and sung We Shall Overcome to build consensus for what they say are basic rights that new immigration law, HB 56, violates. </p>
<p>Speaking at the rally, Birmingham City Councilman Johnathan Austin called the new legislation unjust. &#8220;It&rsquo;s time for us, as brothers and sisters, to stand up for righteousness, stand up for justice and stand up for equality,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anthony Johnson of the Birmingham Metro NAACP likened the immigrant struggle to what Blacks once faced under segregation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must work together, we must pray together, we must fight together, until HB56 is repealed,&#8221; Johnson told The Birmingham News.</p>

		<p>It also keeps the Episcopalians glued to the interests of &#8220;the communities of color&#8221; at the expense of White Humanity.  The Whitey privileged Bishop of Alabama sued on behalf of the illegal invaders.  He must live in a safe neighborhood.</p>
<p><br/>
Even Atlanta&rsquo;s very black mayor called on the clergy, including a Whitey Episcopalian, to try and diffuse the Occupy Atlanta problem.  Keep your eye on this story.  Kasim Reed has been inconsistent and  waffling on how to deal with the occupiers, because &#8220;the eyes of the world are watching the cradle of the civil rights movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the hostile Whitey punks in the park are yelling at the mayor during a press conference while the Episcopalians look all smug and righteous.</p>
<p>We hope the occupiers make our mayor and the civil rights movement look fully Real to the latent Race Realists in all global White Humanity.</p>

		<p>I would call these AA &#8220;leaders&#8221; foolish, but that word doesn&rsquo;t begin to describe their actions. Down right stupid is more like it. They are calling for their own displacement on so many levels in this country, but it looks like they can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t see it due to their hatred of Whitey. They can team up now, but when Mexicans outnumber blacks 3 to 1, they will turn on them like rabid dogs, and there will be no White guilt to stop them. </p>

		<p>Sure, these African-American community leaders support any reach-out program to Latinos.  Your common, everyday black person, though, wants the illegals to go home, more than the average white person I believe.  Hardly the first time leaders or any ilk (elected, self or media appointed, etc.) acted against the wishes of the people they lead.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe a word of it.  Blacks and Hispanics are fighting each other throughout the US in jails, prisons and schools, especially in Calif., where LA County Sheriff Lee Baca has declared there&rsquo;s a black/Hispanic race war in his area.</p>
<p>The above story by BET is the same subterfuge black leadership uses to try to scam people into believing that blacks and Hispanics are &#8220;people of color,&#8221; united as one.</p>
<p>Nonsense!  The rank and file of EVERY racial group in the US wants nothing to do with unintelligent, violence-prone blacks, and a few disingenuous articles won&rsquo;t change a thing.</p>
<p>In fact, when the balloon goes up I look for every racial group in the US to be militarily aligned against blacks except for a few fools.</p>
<p>As the Hispanic Tonto said to the black Lone Ranger when he declared &#8220;Were done for,&#8221; as they were surrounded by Mexicans, to which Tonto replied, &#8220;What do you mean, &#8220;WE?&#8221; </p>

		<p>NBJ- They already are turning on one another. While mestizos don&rsquo;t like Whitey, they DESPISE blacks a whole lot more. It is one of the most superficial and precarious relationships in all of human societies. Alot like the paper thin Afro-Arab relationships in the Middle East and North Africa. That is purely based on religion, which is not as strong of a bond as race/ ethnicity. And the black/ Hispanic connection is strictly used in N. America as a rally against the evils of White civilization. When separated naturally they don&rsquo;t want to unite until one group has a grievance against the &#8220;Man&#8221;.  But make no mistake. If given a choice mestizos will side with European- Americans. Our languages may differ but our color is not as far off, and Christianity is a big uniter. Not Islam. </p>
<p>Socioeconomic similarities between the races is a common uniter because these economic times are extreme and dire to say the least. When times are good, if and when that happens in America again, people will go back to self segregating. It&rsquo;s when minorities pack up in a flash mob in a civilized community is when people will see great diversity.</p>

		<p>BannerRWB, I wish I could agree with you but I fear whites will not band together.  Perhaps the only thing that will make them do so is by accident when their own upscale neighborhoods begin to burn.  Even then, they&rsquo;ll profess forgiveness and blame no one group because wealthy, secure whites tend to be Christian and Christians that I know of in this country are scarily left-leaning about everything except abortion and separation of church and state.</p>
<p>I expect to see Courtney from Alabama&rsquo;s post here soon since she lives there.  I&rsquo;m so glad I don&rsquo;t but then, I&rsquo;m in Tampa, FL where, when I moved here one year ago, I was shocked to find it&rsquo;s one of the biggest ghetto-filled messes I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  To top it off, the nicest elementary, middle, and high schools are called &#8220;prep academies&#8221; and have 90% black, 5% latino, and maybe 5% white attendance.  These schools are square in the middle of each ghetto.  I KNOW the welfare class that sends their children to them are NOT paying the bills for these extremely upscale schools.  Yet, the area has one of the highest crime rates in the U.S. and police helicopters patrol it from 12 midnight to 4 a.m. seven nights a week.  I feel like it&rsquo;s post-apocalyptic here.</p>
<p>After a year I am still trying to get over the shocking state that a beautiful city like this is in, all due to liberal concepts and applications.  I suppose I will forever wonder why so many of its citizens complain about the problems yet always vote liberal Democrat.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe the hype here folks! There is no love lost between these two groups and most know it. The self-appointed leaders of the non-white identity politics world have tried to sell this &#8220;us against them&#8221; solidarity between &#8220;peoples of color&#8221; and evil Whitey for decades - and it had always been a farce. Blacks are out for Blacks, Hispanics Hispanics, etc. Their &#8220;leaders&#8221; may play politics, but the reality on the street is altogether different.     </p>

		<p>To those whites who are fence-sitting on the immigration issue, I have to ask. Do you ever agree with this collection of groups (African-American, Latino, Birmingham council, NAACP) about anything? Me either. But they are in action and you are not.  While you are making up your mind, in your own sweet time, the field of action is already changing.  You aren&rsquo;t even being left in peace to make up your own mind. This is by people you don&rsquo;t agree with on anything else. </p>
<p>What needs to be changed here?  </p>

		<p>I know what Blacks are thinking.  They are thinking that the Latinos will help them to take over America and get the White people to supply more free goodies.<br/>
<p><br/>
But letting in Latinos is a very stupid move by the Blacks for two reasons:<br/>
<p><br/>
One, there is really only a limited amount of free goodies that the White people can supply.<br/>
<p><br/>
Two, Blacks already have it made in America.  They are the official victim / freeloader.  Inviting in another non-White group to freeload off the White people&rsquo;s generosity is just plain dumb.  <br/>
<p><br/>
Blacks are feeding comfortably on their White hosts.  Incredibly they invite in another parasite to join the feeding.  Blacks and Latinos are competitive parasites.  Soon the two will kill the host, and both parasites will die.<br/>

		<p>Blacks are the most foolish of all the nonwhite groups.  They blame everything wrong in their lives or why even another nonwhite group doesn&rsquo;t like them as a &#8216;white man conspiracy&rsquo; or blame &#8216;white media for stereotyping blacks.&rsquo;  Most are either too stupid or dishonest to realize they are their own cause for their problems and why other groups (Latinos, Asians, Arabs, etc) don&rsquo;t care for them.</p>

		<p>I hear blacks loudly supporting the dispossession of whites in the media regularly, with the rationale being that they will join together with Hispanics to gain political and social power over a white dominant culture. One of the ideas they love to float around is a long term plan to write a new US Constitution, since the original is an invalid document written by slaveholders, with no brown or black input. I don&rsquo;t see this working out well for blacks in the long term, but they strike me as people who are not adept at taking the long-view on most issues.       </p>
