<h1><a href="https://moneyland.time.com/2011/10/20/is-occupy-wall-street-too-white/">Is Occupy Wall Street Too White?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Martha C. White, Time, October 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Occupy Wall Street movement that has spread beyond New York&rsquo;s financial district to cities all over the country and even beyond the U.S. has one glaring shortcoming, according to some activists: It&rsquo;s too white. According to the Village Voice, New Yorker Malik Rhasaan launched a Facebook page for Occupy The Hood after observing what he sees as a lack of racial diversity among OWS protesters. &#8220;I noticed there isn&rsquo;t a strong black and Latino presence. &hellip; People don&rsquo;t know why Wall Street affects them. It affects us the most when we&rsquo;re not knowledgeable about it,&#8221; he told the newspaper. {snip}</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s impossible to precisely measure the racial makeup of the deliberately leaderless Occupy movement, most of the images and video clips that have garnered media attention do indeed seem to feature mostly whites. Occupy The Hood leaders say their role is necessary because the more established protest movements don&rsquo;t do enough to address racism in financial industry misdeeds. &#8220;They&rsquo;re gonna have a problem with people of color [getting involved] if they don&rsquo;t connect the effects of capitalism to racism,&#8221; Uhuru told the San Francisco Bay View newspaper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2009, a former Wells Fargo employee-turned-whistleblower accused the bank of targeting minorities for subprime lending. &#8220;Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans,&#8221; she told the New York Times.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Even if minorities do have a distinct set of grievances against the financial sector, however, it&rsquo;s unclear that launching a splinter movement will prove an effective way to see them addressed. {snip}</p>

		<p>Somebody needs to make a bunch of signs and flyers to pass out at these misguided events that say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, all you young, white unemployed people with no hope for the future!  How&rsquo;s all that affirmative action, illegal immigration, minority set-asides, open borders, enforced diversity and multiculuralism workin&rsquo; out for ya&rsquo;?  It&rsquo;s just gonna get worse for you - white people!  What did you think was gonna&rsquo; happen when your &#8216;white priviledge&rsquo; became public enemy number one?  At the unemployment line, remember that diversity is a strength!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Occupy the Hood?  Seems redundant.  Blacks already &#8220;occupy the hood,&#8221; and they have for a long time.  That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s the hood.</p>

		<p>One reason the Occupy Wall Street Movement has relatively low minority participation:</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t about race!</p>
<p>So, in order to attract blacks and browns, Occupy the Hood proposes to introduce a racial component:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They&rsquo;re gonna have a problem with people of color [getting involved] if they don&rsquo;t connect the effects of capitalism to racism&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Gee, I thought capitalism was an economic philosophy, not a racial program.  But sure as the world, they wanna make it into something racial; just to gain &#8220;street cred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poster #1 has it right; these commies deserve their diversity with all its trappings!</p>
<p>A local counter-protester held a sign addressed to the 99%ers:  &#8220;YOU ARE THE MINORITY.  MORE OF US WOULD BE HERE, BUT MOST HAVE TO BE AT WORK.&#8221;          </p>

		<p>I recall news stories that featured black folks complaining that &#8216;racist&rsquo; banks weren&rsquo;t giving them mortgages; locking them out of home ownership.</p>
<p>The banks, fearful of the &#8216;racist&rsquo; label, complied. </p>
<p>In Indianapolis the banks actually conducted a &#8216;loan fair&rsquo; to which minorities were invited.</p>
<p>The loans were issued and blacks failed to pay. That, they said, was not their fault. It was the fault of &#8216;predatory lending&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I read yesterday that she had in fact been told, &#8220;We shoot white bitches here everyday.&#8221;  It was witnessed by cameramen, but she wouldn&rsquo;t repeat the exact words, nor did she seem to complain about it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re cracking down on Occupy Oakland. I&rsquo;m the poster who predicted the violence last week, and it seems there have been muggings, robberies, rapes, and sexual harassment going on all along.  Occupiers were defecating and urinating all around the park.  The public health problem prompted the first initiative to move them out, but the deeper motive was the basic crime going on.  </p>

		<p>Most blacks and Hispanics are too lazy for a long running camp out like this.  It&rsquo;s too peaceful, in most places, they like action.  These whites are used to doing it,&hellip; Burning Man, camping out at Star Wars premiers, and the like.  If there was a sale or giveaway of some Skechers or some other bling/swag, they&rsquo;d be in the forefront.</p>

		<p> From what I&rsquo;ve seen in person at a &#8216;protest&rsquo;, the &#8216;occupy wall street&rsquo; protestors are Hippies and losers. This is a no-hope event occupying completely harmless places like Parks.<br>
 I&rsquo;m certain the Bankers and Financiers behind our economic woes are trembling in terror&hellip; oops&hellip; laughter.</p>
<p> IMHO, If they&rsquo;d carried out their original intent, occupied and shut down the Stock Exchanges, Futures markets and Federal Reserves, they MIGHT have actually had a chance at starting a full-scale uprising.</p>

		<p>One has to ask, can something, anything EVER be too black? too Hispanic, too Asian, etc? What does &#8220;too White&#8221; even mean? How did we come to this point where everything, anything simply must have some unspecified number of non-Whites involved, lest it be deemed wicked somehow? </p>

<p>Yes, poor blacks and hispanics.  It&rsquo;s never their fault they aren&rsquo;t where they want to be in life.  It&rsquo;s always the fault of whites.  Let&rsquo;s be more concerned with how blacks and hispanics feelings are hurt than our rights and our freedoms.  </p>

		<p>Uhuru is mistaken is he thinks that capitalism causes &#8220;racism.&#8221;  A free market is in fact the best antidote to discrimination based on race.  In a free market, participants overwhelmingly care about getting value for money (on the one side) and maximizing return to investment (on the other).  </p>
<p>In my personal life, I prefer the company of my fellow whites. I socialize exclusively with Europeans and European-Americans, preferably those who are racially conscious.</p>
<p>In my business life, I have to hire the best person for the job, and I have to provide value to my customers otherwise I will lose them. If I were to discriminate on the basis of race in business, I would pay a price in terms of lost contracts, inferior work, or profits foregone. The only color that really matters there is green - the color of money.</p>
<p>Uhuru&rsquo;s (and the Left&rsquo;s) plaintive whining that capitalism promotes racism stems from unequal financial outcomes between blacks and whites.  &#8220;Wealth Gaps Rise to Record Highs Between Whites, Blacks, Hispanics&#8221;<br>

<p>Blacks tend to have a higher time preference and lower cognitive abilities than whites.  Consequently blacks aren&rsquo;t exactly the keystone of the saving-and-investing community.</p>

		<p>There is a simple reason for the lack of racial diversity. The Blacks are still waiting for marching orders from the Black leadership. Whites will show up on their own, but Blacks lack initiative. They need to be picked up and bussed in order to participate in an event. You want diversity? Let Jessie Jackson or Al Sharpton show up, then these white liberal kids will learn what diversity is all about.</p>

		<p>I guess that I&rsquo;m confused. When I saw interviews from this group of protesters, They were black and of course demanding that the people who have a lot of money, should share their wealth. Of course, in other words, give me your money cause we deserve it even though we have done nothing to earn it. Another example of give us all your money and more unearned assistance, not just some of it.</p>

		<p>Anon #6, that is exactly what happened at the Atlanta occu-fest. A calm, peaceful, albeit non-sensical and disorganized group of whiners hung out at a park in Atlanta until Saturday night, when low and behold, against orders from the Mayor two hip hop bands invaded the park, and the usual mayhem ensued, forcing the mayor to rethink his plan of allowing peaceful assembly, and it took half a police force to move them out. </p>

		<p>Too white? Thats a racist comment&hellip; dont they watch Fox News? They have that black guy on blaming the &#8220;joos&#8221; every other night.</p>
<p>So when Oakland&rsquo;s finest black cops beat on white marxist &#8220;trash,&#8221; there&rsquo;s no calls of racism?  We all know what happens when its Boston, LA, or NYC&hellip;</p>

		<p>On the local radio station this morning they had a report about how the kitchen volunteers, who had been preparing delicious meals for hundreds of people every day, were &#8220;tired of giving gourmet meals to homeless people and ex-cons&#8221; who were showing up like clockwork at the protests for the free food.</p>
<p>The volunteers (all white) were staging a mini-protest by serving only PB and J for 18 hours. </p>

<p>Yet, that&rsquo;s the kind of government they call for.  Most Occtuards would approve of prohibiting employers from asking about a job applicant&rsquo;s previous felony conviction record, because of the &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; it has on blacks.  Since when are &#8220;ex-cons&#8221; bad people?  Remember, they&rsquo;re just innocent black people who were screwed over by the big bad ugly system.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #7:  If reported Holloway had been told that they shoot &#8220;White Bitches,&#8221; I am disgusted that SHE didn&rsquo;t tell anyone about it, if she in fact didn&rsquo;t. It is more likely that the Politically Correct news station omitted this fact.</p>
