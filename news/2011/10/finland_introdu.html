<h1><a href="http://abna.ir/data.asp?lang=3&amp;id=271340">Finland Introduces Islamic Studies Textbooks into Public Schools</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AhlulBayt News Agency, October 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Finland has introduced its first official; textbook to teach Islam in its public school system. </p>
<p>Salam  &mdash;  islamin polku, or &#8220;Salam  &mdash;  the Path of Islam&#8221; is intended for children in the first and second grades. Books for higher grades are currently under development. </p>
<p>Religious instruction is available at Finnish schools for pupils who are members of the established Lutheran and Orthodox Churches, as well as for those who are members of other officially registered religions if there is enough demand for the instruction in the school. Pupils who are not members of any religion take classes in ethics. </p>
<p>Though Islam is offered as a religious class in a number of public schools, previously there had been no textbook for the subject. Instead, the same handbook-type guide had been used at all grade levels. </p>
<p>Suaad Onniselk채, who teaches Islam at the lower level comprehensive school in Vesala in the east of Helsinki, is one of the authors of the textbook. </p>
<p>In the book, two Finnish Muslim children, Fatima and Adam, learn the Islamic calendar year, and Muslim customs and behaviour. The book also teaches pupils about other religions, and the importance of tolerance for others. </p>
<p>In the stories in the book the children visit a forest, a grandmother&rsquo;s farm, and bake wheat buns. </p>
<p>&#8220;The stories are set in Finland so that the events would have resonance with the lives of the pupils. The status of Islam as a minority religion is reflected in the fact that the stories also teach how it is possible to live along with other people even though the religion and customs are different&#8221;, Onniselk채 says. </p>
<p>The different variations of Islam are also taken into consideration in the book. </p>
<p>&#8220;There are differences especially in the terminology, so we have tried to use terms that are suitable to all.&#8221; </p>
<p>Comments for the book were collected from various Muslim communities and from representatives of different mosques. Onniselk채 says that the reception was positive. </p>
<p>Eight-year-old Inas Ahmad is enthusiastic about the new book. Inas feels that the pictures are nice. Before the book came around, they would use photocopied texts and their own notebooks. </p>
<p>&#8220;The stories are good, because the girl and the boy behave well toward each other&#8221;, says Sami Dirie, age 8. </p>
<p>Dirie plans to read the stories at home with his parents, who have already asked him about the new textbook. </p>
<p>Onniselk채 says that older Muslim pupils are also anxiously waiting for their own religion textbooks. </p>
<p>&#8220;Having their own book is truly important for the pupils&#8221;, she says. &#8220;Since there are books for other subjects and not for Islam, they have felt that it is not appreciated as much.&#8221; </p>
<p>Next spring a textbook from the same series will be ready for grades 7-9. After this the books for grades 3-4 and 5-6 are scheduled to come out. </p>
<p>Textbooks at the high school level will appear in the spring of 2012, and they might also be translated into Swedish.</p>

<p>More or less correct. But that applies solely to &#8220;People of the Book&#8221;  (Chistians and Jews). It is assumed that eventually Christians and Jews will see the light and will  come around to &#8220;the perfect religion&#8221;.  They are just being granted an extension of time.  It is not forever.</p>
<p>All others, including non-believers like atheists, are entitled to NO tolerance. None whatsoever! They  have no right to exist AT ALL.  For them, it is slavery or slaughter.</p>

		<p>This is nothing but the SYSTEMATIC ABOLISHMENT of the white race- there is no other way of putting it. For white Americans, blacks are only a symptom of a dreadful disease that is sweeping thru the Western world, and WHITES need to find the CAUSE of the disease. Too much emphasis on the symptoms will do you no good.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all dark and tan faces because only Muslim children take these classes. I don&rsquo;t know of any Muslim kid whose parents are both white. There are quite a few with a white mother, though.</p>

&#8220;I can&rsquo;t understand why people like these Finnish and Scandinavian, and Christian dominated nations (Western) are so willing to commit suicide in order to prove how tolerant they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mainstream Christianity is dead in Finland. The people in charge of the national church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, are liberals who don&rsquo;t care about the Bible and are simply using their post to enact social justice, i.e. housing illegal immigrants and prostrating before Islamists. They even have priests who don&rsquo;t believe in God. Their favorite argument is &#8220;Jesus taught us to love, so we should&#8221; followed by something that&rsquo;s completely contradictory to what is written in the New Testament, like celebrating homosexuality. </p>
<p>More conservative Christianity, where the Bible might be considered to be more than toilet paper, is confined to smaller movements outside of the main church. It goes without saying that these movements are scorned by the &#8220;tolerant&#8221; liberals. Maybe Jesus&rsquo; love has its limits. So Finland is not really a Christian country anymore.</p>
<p>To put my words in proper context: I was born without a religion. I&rsquo;ve never, even for a second in my life, been a Christian. I don&rsquo;t believe in any gods. But I do believe in honesty.</p>
<p>Eva <br>
&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see the problem. If there were a greater number of Jewish kids, no doubt there would be instruction in Judaism. And if Finns produced a greater number of children, the situation of needing to accept Moslem immigrants would not have arisen.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is no situation. We don&rsquo;t need any of these Muslim immigrants. They are, almost without exception, here for humanitarian reasons. They are just a money sink, a liability. They have no skills that would gain them any meaningful employment in a highly specialized job market like ours. Many of them are illiterate. Their only function is to satisfy some kind of imaginary diversity quota. Everything else is just a lame attempt to legitimize this diversification project. None of it stands up to scrutiny.</p>

		<p>In California, they are indoctrinating children with the homosexual &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; now. In Finland, they teach them to be Muslims. I wonder what happens when the paths of indoctrination cross in the same modern liberal system.</p>

Oh boy, did you get that wrong!</p>
<p>The Finns are emphatically NOT Russian, neither ethnically nor culturally,  and the sentiment there is very anti-Russian.</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between the two.  They are much closer to the Swedes (although distinct), and Swedish is the second language of the country.</p>

		<p>Finland as well? The place was a beacon of hope and its demographics are still pretty good. Most of it&rsquo;s non-Finnish population is Russian, Swedish or Estonian. A quick wiki search suggests though that its Somali population has gone from zero (that&rsquo;s NONE AT ALL) to over 13,000 in 20 years.<br>

<p>Well!  Let me give you a good example.  </p>
<p>Multiculturalism:</p>
<p>Multiculturalism has been hailed as the greatest working concept since the Roman Empire, by certain vested-interests, of course.  </p>
<p>The architects of this religion-like cult, who, I&rsquo;m sure there is no need to allude to (see Frankfurt School and its contemporary replacement, Common Purpose), actually modelled this creed to run along religious lines.  </p>
<p>Within sixty years, before the Western world knew what had hit it, sure enough, the tenets and edicts of this new &#8216;religion&rsquo; had been put into operation in all its poisonous and destructive aspects across the whole of the political, judicial and social spectrums including sizeable swathes of the Third World too.  </p>
<p>The architects and adherents (disciples) of this creed even had the blatant nerve to hijack concepts and ideas from ancient Books of Learning such as those you alluded to prior.</p>
<p>In other words, the architects and adherents (disciples) of multiculturalism see themselves as the high priests and scholars of their devilish creation and have successfully infected the body politics and souls of those who have been indoctrinated with it.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Although I was born a Hindu, I&rsquo;m proud to have converted to ATHEISM. It&rsquo;s amazing that more white racialists are NOT atheists- evolution makes a strong case for certain races to be more evolved than others. But, no- the vast majority of white racialists cling on to that bible. The bible is a book of FAIRY TALES&#8221;</i>.</p>
<p>Sureesh, would you say that your ethnic identity is still completely intact in view of your declared conversion to Atheism since such a near-nihilistic belief system is <b>not</b> part of your ethnic heritage, culture and tradition(s)?  </p>
<p><b>Are</b> Atheists more <i>intelligent</i> than Christians and/or Hindus?  Could you perhaps furnish the board with any evidence that say they are?</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Racial realism would have a much stronger base if you give up your Christianity and focus on evolution and science.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Please check our the historical legacy of Christianity before committing your thoughts to the public domain.  </p>
<p>This religion gave rise to the most advanced civilization the world has ever known, the White European civilization since perhaps the era of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The subjects of science, medicine, technology development, geography, physics and natural history gradually reach their zeniths as regards ongoing research and discovery at the height of Christian influence <i>and has slowly begun declining in lock-step with the decline of Christianity, and the advent of multiculturalism</i>, the new &#8216;religion&rsquo; which is already exposing holes in its alleged truths. </p>
<p>Think again!<br>

<p>Exactly the same methodology and outcome has befallen my homeland - Ireland <b>within just twelve years.</b> </p>
<p>OK!  Let&rsquo;s examine the workings of an alternative example, one that doesn&rsquo;t encompass a whole country, but instead, a village.</p>
<p>Say, for instance, I have bought up a whole village and have successfully wrestled control of its local economy and by defacto, its monetary wealth.  It shouldn&rsquo;t take long for me to also spread my tentacles into its parish council, urban district council, judicial system and simultaneously commence heavily investing in or outright buying up the local media too.</p>
<p>From here on in, I can call the shots in relation to the general culture and belief system which includes shaping the cirruculum and, therefore, thought processes of the local education establishment(s) ensuring that only those who buy my politics get to teach in them.</p>
<p>If, I am of a particularly dictatorial and violent disposition, I can insist upon anything I want by employing smear tactics against anyone who challenges me including forcibly relieving him/her of his/her livelihood and good name, and incarceration if all else fails.  I can ensure he/she never succeeds in obtaining meaningful employemnt again and that his/her  offspring suffer the after-effects as a result.</p>
<p>In short, I can hold the whole population to ransom and  systematically replace them with suitable alternative sheeple (or should that be cattle) if I chose to.</p>
<p>If anyone does challenge me after this, I can command, through my puppets in high places, the utilisation of the law enforcement agency and/or the Territorial Army.</p>
<p>Now, how would you go about terminating my despotic reign of power and having me apprehended?<br>

<p>Wrong all around.  IN addition to what has already been said about religious instruction in public schools, there is the FACT that Jews have been present in Europe since Roman times.  REGARDLESS of some old and new conspiracies theories and accusations, Jews have contributed essentially to Europe&rsquo;s progress while keeping their religion to themselves.</p>
