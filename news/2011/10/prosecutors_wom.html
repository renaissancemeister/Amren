<h1>Prosecutors: Women Talk of Jihad in Recorded Calls</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS News, October 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two Minnesota women accused of funneling money to a terror group in Somalia talked about collecting money for al-Shabab, supporting fighters instead of other charities and the possibility that FBI was listening in on their conversations, according to hours of recorded phone calls played for jurors.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have built the bulk of their case by playing more than 80 phone calls recorded during a 10-month wiretap on the home and cellphones of Amina Farah Ali, 35. In those calls, prosecutors allege, Ali is heard talking to her co-defendant, 64-year-old Hawo Mohamed Hassan, as well as leaders of al-Shabab in Somalia. The calls include recordings of teleconferences in which the women gave religious lectures and collected donations.</p>
<p>Ali and Hassan are accused of being part of a &#8220;deadly pipeline&#8221; that routed money and fighters from the U.S. to Somalia. The women, U.S. citizens of Somali descent, are charged with conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. The women have said they were raising money for needy refugees in Somalia.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In one October 2008 call between Ali and Hassan, prosecutors allege that as the two women were discussing where the money should go, Ali said the priority be those who stand up for Islam. &#8220;Let the civilians die,&#8221; she said. In a Feb. 10, 2009, teleconference, Ali told others, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s forget about the other charities  &mdash;  how about the jihad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ali and Hassan are among 20 people charged in Minnesota&rsquo;s long-running federal investigations into recruiting and financing for al-Shabab, which the U.S. considers a terror group with ties to al-Qaida. Investigators believe at least 21 men left Minnesota  &mdash;  home to the country&rsquo;s largest Somali community  &mdash;  to join al-Shabab. Though others have pleaded guilty to related charges, the women are the first to go on trial.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scott also noted that after the U.S. declared al-Shabab a terror group in February 2008, the FBI made no attempt to &#8220;inform her that she should not be sending money to this newly declared foreign terrorist organization.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Our government is importing Somalians by the hundreds of thousands now, granting them refugee status. The city I live in is now host to over ten thousand of them, and they &hellip;.are&hellip;..AWFUL !!!!</p>
<p>  They are rude, act like they are due special privileges, and have a bizarre sense of entitlement that must be seen to be believed. Their children are garbaging up our schools and need to have one-on-one instructors throughout the day because they are too stupid to do anything other than what pops into their mind from one second to the next. The adults don&rsquo;t work, WON&rsquo;T work, and have no intention of ever doing so, because they get welfare/food stamps/section 8 housing/free medical/etc/etc. </p>

		<p>I often listen to a (internet) radio show hosted by US nationalist Jamie Kelso (Voice of Reason broadcast network) and he has noted how Christian groups import these Somalis by the plane loads, and give them everything they could possible want for free. These idiots actually think that they are doing great work&hellip;</p>
<p>Wich is very strange. You would think that American people should have learned by now that importing Africans is not a good idea.</p>

		<p>You would think that these Somalian females would be keeping well clear of their extemist Muslim brethren, what with the Muslim penchant for chopping of female genitals, child sexual abuse and subjection to a life of beatings and mental torture particularly rampant in the Sudan and contiguous territories.</p>
<p>Talk about brainwashed morons!  There&rsquo;s no better examples of that than we have here.  </p>

		<p>The average IQ of somalians is 68. Unlike those with average IQs of 85 and 82 that means they will never learn to read at 2nd grade level.</p>
<p>When they committ murders the Lutherans will provide free attorneys to argue that they are too developmentally disabled to understand the difference between right and wrong and should therefore the murder charges should be dropped.</p>

		<p>Domestic do-gooders do great harm but they can&rsquo;t give these Africans refugee status or US citizenship. If the State Department is shipping them in, what are we supposed to do about it? Write our Congressman? </p>
<p>This is why the question, &#8220;Why are we allowing this?&#8221; is misdirected and unproductive. That question blames the victims for failing to prevent a colossal evil that was planned without our knowledge and is being carried out against our will.</p>

<p>Such a salient point is extremely well articulated by your goodself, indeed.</p>
<p>We must be cunning and look for divisions within enemy ranks and accordingly exploit them to the hilt.  This can be done very covertly.  Yes, it takes time and time is not on our side, but it is up to us to cleverly expedite our counter attacks by devising ever-increasingly cunning and devious means to achieve our ends.  The dirtier the better!</p>
<p>All you have to do is to remember that our &#8216;devious&rsquo;, &#8216;cunning&rsquo; and &#8216;dirty&rsquo; tactics are the true, justifiable and honest means of going about it.  Only the enemy camp see those tactics as pentultimately described.</p>
<p>Incidently, there is evidence it is working, a treat albeit tentatively at the moment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m already &#8216;at it&rsquo; via a political outlet.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Why do we let Somalis become U.S. citizens again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the Communist-led idea that it will &#8220;enrich&#8221; you whilst obviously weakening you will be taken up and promoted by the secret communists in the US media and government. Duh!</p>

		<p>Not as bad as black Americans (Somalis want to work, after all), but hardly the kind of persons we should be eagerly seeking as new citizens. Refugees have proven to be a major mistake in Europe, even in countries with plenty of resources to throw at them (think Scandinavian countries). A sound immigration policy does not let in ignorant villagers who cannot use the opportunities available in America. A sound policy would let in only the rare individual who is clearly able to create opportunities for our own children. That is  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t let in someone who will replace an American; let in someone who will create even more opportunities for Americans.</p>

		<p>I have Googled the question many times - Who is bringing Somalians here? I have not found out who is responsible, though I suspect it is both religious groups and/or the United Nations. And I believe it involves payment for each one brought in. All white areas are being targeted. These Somalians, and their many descendents will NEVER be anything but a burden as dependents on our society. When the government finally runs out of money to support them, they will turn on the surrounding citizens for survival. Arm yourselves.</p>
