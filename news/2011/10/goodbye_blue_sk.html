		<p>In a sane world, lame-stream conservative shills like Beck, Limbaugh, etc. would be shelved in favor of genuine alternative Right voices filling the airwaves. I never miss a Ram video. Though this one is a fittingly sad tribute, the man has a wit about him and is often hilarious.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s stories like these that push my bitterness and anger over the edge when I see how White people are treated everywhere today, into the realm of that forbidden place called hatred. I&rsquo;ve heard all the arguments before, such as you can&rsquo;t judge a whole race of people by the actions of a few. Black on White crime has more than &#8220;a few&#8221; victims: I know it, they know it, and my feelings are totally justified.</p>

		<p>The murderers of these White kids were more clever than many. They were careful to lay mitigation plans by robbing the kids before executing them. It is likely that will pan out. The expensive Government provided taxpayer funded defense lawyers that will be provided their &#8220;clients&#8221; will likely be able to successfully argue that the murders lacked any hateful intent.</p>

		<p>The lesson here is that even in Western and Midwestern states, where the murder of whites by blacks is less common than other areas; it can and does happen. Let&rsquo;s not forget that &#8220;The Wichita Massacre&#8221; happened in Kansas. It really does not matter where whites live. If there are feral blacks in the area, your life is in danger. Whites must be organized, trained and armed. Sadly, we have no choice at this point. </p>

		<p>No news coverage of this outside of the local area.  It will probably be forgotten in a few days there too.  Two beautiful young whites killed, ho hum. The government has more important things to do than worry about two dead worthless whites   &mdash;   like making sure violent Mexican drug lords have full and free access to American guns.</p>

		<p>This is a common everyday occurrence in America today. As sad as this is, most White victims are raped, mutilated and tortured by the black thugs first. Much like the Christian/Newsome murders.  But, most Whites will not pay attention to the race of the perps and put two and two together, or they will forgive them and say it isn&rsquo;t about &#8220;skin color&#8221;. This is how insanely naive most Whites have become and even family members of the victims almost always forgive the black perps. They have not learned a darn thing in the murderous deaths of their own White family member. Pathetic.</p>

		<p>I like and respect Ramzpaul. He tells it like it is. He&rsquo;s reporting on one of the many black perpetrated crimes where national and international media are silent. Especially if the victims are white. Same reason we don&rsquo;t hear about the white genocide in South Africa on national news. Or if they can&rsquo;t hide the story, they leave out the race of the perpetrator(s) when they are black, but not if they are white or hispanic. This is why I now get the majority of my news from the internet. I consider most news sources to be complicit in keeping white people in the dark as much as possible concerning blacks committing crimes, showing a total disregard for our safety. This is why I&rsquo;m sure there is a world wide agenda of genocide against the white race. And I have lost almost all respect for this world&rsquo;s ruling elites, our politicians and the media.</p>

		<p>The fact that obvious hate crimes such as is depicted in the above video are consistently covered up by the so-called main-stream media is prima facia evidence that a conspiracy exists.</p>
<p>It can also be, and accurately, described as a crime. To purposely deprive people of information that would make them safer, is criminal behavior.</p>
<p>Given that Whites account for only about 7% of the population of the world, every single murder of a White diminishes the race, and particularly when those murdered are in their prime reproductive years. Not to take away from the morally heinous nature of any murder, when the murder victims are members of such a small minority, the loss is magnified.</p>
<p>Whites need to become super sensitive to their tenuous position in a very, very dangerous world and one that is becoming increasingly dangerous for them.</p>
<p>Take immediate steps to protect yourselves. This is especially important as the economic situation continues to deteriorate.</p>

		<p>Here is the headline Fox ran on this story:</p>
<p><b>Forgiving the killers of a young couple</b></p>
<p>Paragraph #1:</p>
<p><i>Police say the two men arrested on murder charges showed no remorse for their alleged crimes.</i></p>
<p>No mention of race.</p>
<p>Two racist blacks kill two young Whites which was their prime objective. Why would they feel remorse and who but media (INCLUDING FOX) brainwashed morons would expect them to?  Got that Whites?  I suspect these two are proud of what they did and will perhaps become heroes in the black community.  </p>
<p>Have you EVER see any outcry from the black community or black &#8220;leaders&#8221; (or the media or the government or academia) when Whites are murdered/tortured/raped by blacks??  NO, only screams demanding MORE entitlements.</p>
<p>This is what is supremely wrong with White people:</p>
<p><i>Ethan&rsquo;s father is fighting to forgive the men who took away his youngest child. &#8220;I know I have to forgive to be forgiven but I can&rsquo;t find it in my heart for them to,&rdquo; says Scott Nichols. Ethan&rsquo;s mother believes he will find forgiveness.</i></p>
<p>Forgive the killer of your child?  <b>ARE YOU KIDDING ME?</b>  These racist, White-hating killers deserve neither mercy nor forgiveness from anyone, only a quick appointment with old sparky.  </p>
<p><i>Much like the Christian/Newsome murders. But, most Whites will not pay attention to the race of the perps and put two and two together, or they will forgive them and say it isn&rsquo;t about &ldquo;skin color&rdquo;. This is how insanely naive most Whites have become and even family members of the victims almost always forgive the black perps.</i></p>
<p>People ARE waking up about media cover-up of disproportionate, high numbers of  black-on-White rapes/tortures/murders.  The Internet has allowed us to reveal media and government LIES.  </p>
<p>Long may it live in liberty.  </p>
<p>We must defend against Internet censorship the same way we defend The Second Amendment because it is just as important, otherwise we are slaves to the White-hating, lying media that seek our genocide.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the first comments from the Fox news story: </p>
<p>*Black people murdering innocent young white people?! What a surprise. Not.</p>
<p>* That this story received so little media attention points to how backwards and anti-White the establishment has become.</p>
<p>*Give these two goons forgiveness with a 230 grain bullet. These murderers have no soul. Imagine what else they will do if they get set free&hellip;</p>
<p>*Anti-whites always either ignore or try to minimize non-white violent crime committed against whites. Anti-whites are opposed to white people defending their group interests. Anti-whites always want what is worse for whites and better for non-whites. Anti-whites want a future where whites have become an extinct life-form. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.</p>
<p>*Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries&hellip;Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to &#8220;assimilate,&#8221; i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites&hellip; But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race&hellip;They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.</p>
<p>* There aren&rsquo;t any &#8220;White Gangs&#8221; laying in wait for non-White victims to stroll by. There aren&rsquo;t any news stories being edited in order to hide the identities of White criminals in the name of Political Correctness. There aren&rsquo;t any non-Whites crying about their children being beaten and worse by a bunch of blood-thirsty White people. These liberal wieners and their Conservative Respectable counterparts claim they are anti-racist. What they are? is anti-White. Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-White.</p>
<p>There is HOPE out there. Continue to spread the word about the dangers of black males far and wide to everyone you love and care about lest you find yourself in the same position as the Horton and Nichols families (or the Burke, Newsom, Christian, Carson families).   You can be sure the media, government and schools won&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>You have got to be kidding. If this was my child, God help his killer. This is an example of why it is so hard to convince White Americans that they need to take a stand. They are so over burdened with the &#8216;White Guilt&rsquo; myth pushed on them by the liberal pop culture media and brain washed by Bible belt evangelists preaching peace and brotherly love that they in essence have become racial wimps.</p>
<p>Like the Constitution and the writings of the founders- who incidentally were against this nation becoming an ethnic racial stew-pot, and one of the reasons it took a brutal war to free the slaves-the bible has been kneaded by liberal theologians into a neat mass of verbiage to create a generation of mindless automatons who are convinced that only by forgiving their aggressors, loving their fellow man regardless of race, and forgiving all transgressions will they attain &#8216;Valhalla&rsquo;. I would rather face all the punishments that Hell would have to offer than share eternity with a host of hypocrites.  </p>

<p>The antique European Christians of the Crusades lived in an actual Christian society. They are a better reference for Christian life than the liberal &#8220;Jesus is my homie&#8221; freaks of today. </p>
<p>The Emperor Constantine I was given a direct order, in person, from Christ in the year 312 to conquer in His sign. That is not the order of a pacifist, it explicitly overrides &#8220;turning the other cheek&#8221;. And that order still stands today. </p>

Someone needs to tell those misguided Pseudo-Christians that the first step to forgiveness is repentance. Did Jesus forgive one thief on the cross or two? Only one. the second one did not repent. Save your blather until the murderer falls at the feet of the poor parents in genuine abhorrence of what he has done. Then you can talk about forgiveness.  </p>

<p>MAN, are you confused!  Valhalla has NOTHING to do with Christianity and WAS NEVER about forgiveness or turning the cheek, etc.  It was about the Nordic Warriors creed to die fighting with a sword in his hand as a hero in the eyes of Odin, the chief Norse God. There was no forgiveness and once an oath was taken, it was not revokable and one&rsquo;s honor and life depended upon it.  There was NO confession, no excuse, no way to worm out of responsibility.  You either perform or die. A man was an honorable creature with honor as his code, not a sheep to be led by others. </p>
<p>Many who think themselves Christians today such as the following poster, is confused about where his Northern European culture ends and his Christianity begins;</p>

<p>Fools probably barely have read the entire Bible, and clearly know nothing of the doctrines and history of Christianity. &#8220;</p>
<p>&gt;And on he goes, failing to explain how Rome utilized Christianity to reconquer Europe, causing wars, deaths and suffering in Europe for at least the next 1500 years.  The immediate affect of Christianity in Rome and the Roman world was the suppression of all knowledge beyond that of itself.  So the knowledge taught by Greek philosophers and their kind with the famous example of Hypatia of Alexandria was violently suppressed.  The effect was to plunge Europe into the darkness of ignorance, superstition and violence for the next thousand years.  </p>
<p> Christian writers such as Paul were pretty clear about what was intended BEFORE the Romans got control of it. But none of them realized that handwriting could be compared, words analyzed, etc., let alone carbon dating invented.  It is historically obvious that the absorption of Christianity by Rome was a political move.  To make Christianity palatable to Romans things had to be inserted and rewritten so that Paul didn&rsquo;t look like an obvious (to them) Roman agent infiltrating a Jewish Sect, and so that there could be someone else besides Romans to blame for the crucifixion.  Scholars today have identified through forensic analysis the many forgeries and insertions made long after the first century.  I posted somewhere last week about how Pope Boniface titled himself &#8220;Caesar&#8221; in 1299.  The Holy Roman Empire.  Roman domination was always the motivation, the best way to achieve it in the 4th century became to adapt a popular religion as the official one. </p>
<p>FURTHER if 16  &mdash;  RegvlvsSeradly knew as much of the history of Christianity as he claims he would know that for example, the early church leaders made suicide a sin because converts were rushing Roman garrisons, sure that they would next be in heaven with Jesus.  The civil unrest went on all over the Roman world, but even in Rome, where Christians were eventually banished.  Later, in a perverse fulfillment of their death wishes, they were featured in the Colosseum where the Romans at least got some entertainment value out of the Christian death wish.  He would know that early Christianity spread like wildfire because the wealthy, fearful of the impending Apocalypse and the promise that the wealthy would not enter the Kingdom of Heaven gave their wealth to the local churches, who then redistributed it in the first world example of communism.  (Ref. Gibbon)  He would know things such as the Pope bending his knee to St. Francis, who exalted the notion of service to the poor as THE Christian example.</p>
<p>16  &mdash;  RegvlvsSeradly doesn&rsquo;t understand his own material.  I have said it many times here;  There is NOTHING in the NT about exclusivity in Christianity.  It has a mission to convert and include the ENTIRE world.  The OT is about Jews and their &#8220;promise&#8221; of exclusivity by God and cannot be conveyed to Christians of the NT.  Jesus said, &#8220;Suffer the children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for such is The Kingdom of Heaven.&#8221;  He calls on his followers to be like children, like sheep.  There is no context where this and other declarations attributed to Jesus can be overturned by later usurpation by Rome or any other group.</p>
<p>Where does that leave white Christians?  To me, they are a confused lot.  They live in contradiction.  They are like John Calvin, who put a Christian veneer on a political and social urge to separate from Christianity, but hundreds of years of indoctrination, including indoctrination from birth had left him and others of today with limited imagination.  There is little or no intellectual room in a mind full of dogma.  So our #9, like John Calvin cannot recognize the earlier pre-Christian tendency toward the impulse to distinguish one&rsquo;s clan (tribe) from a rule from outside.  Rome was rejected in the North of Europe.  Wars were fought over this devastated Europe over and over until the Thirty Year War finally wore it out.  But it lingers on in Ireland to this day.  The cultural tendency of the independent North was a big part of it but another version of the same resulted because the populace had been terrorized and brainwashed into a state of mind for hundreds of years and could see no options. </p>
<p>The contradictions and self-defeat inherent in Christianity can never be overcome.  Jesus was King of the Jews, not King of Europe.  The Bible says so.  But it also tells its followers to be childlike and like sheep, follow the shepherd.  Is this the basis for a white survival movement?</p>
<p>We need to get a hold of ourselves and finally recognize who and what we are.  We will always be much easier to silence as long as we call ourselves or identify ourselves as Christians because the arguments against exclusiveness and for inclusive &#8220;diversity&#8221; is inherent in Christianity by any interpretation.  The way it was used in Europe historically is not proof of its meaning, but its real history is one reason why this race realist cannot support its continued pretension as beneficial for whites.</p>

&#8220;Someone needs to tell those misguided Pseudo-Christians that the first step to forgiveness is repentance. Did Jesus forgive one thief on the cross or two? Only one. the second one did not repent. Save your blather until the murderer falls at the feet of the poor parents in genuine abhorrence of what he has done. Then you can talk about forgiveness. &#8220;</p>
<p>Where do you get such ideas and claims?  Jesus told both of them that they would join him in paradise that day.  Luke 23;38-43 describes one thief calling on Jesus to save himself and them, while the other thief rebuked the first telling him that while they both were justly punished Jesus had done nothing wrong.  The first thief is only guilty of wanting to live and entreating Jesus to save them all.  It is perceived as an insulting request because the soldiers repeated what his followers say in verse 35; &#8220;He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.&#8221;  It doesn&rsquo;t say that Jesus didn&rsquo;t forgive the first, only that he spoke to the one who told the other that they were both guilty and Jesus innocent.  Very different than a claim of condemnation. And Jesus is illustrated to forgive criminals in other Gospel writings. This is the problem of Bible interpreters; They read in what they wish to understand or claim to other not motivated enough to look it up, as I have just done.  Of course, all of this banter is necessary in order to give meaning to the later Resurrection, and so even the worst players were &#8220;part of the plan.&#8221;  Which makes one wonder why any of them would be condemned by a loving and all forgiving God, especially once his son was sacrificed for mankind&rsquo;s sins.  But even the best writers can&rsquo;t hope to cover all contingencies.</p>
<p>But why discuss forgiveness?  Revenge is only bad to the Christian.  It is fair retribution and satisfying to those who suffer loss due to the violence of others.  Once the guilty have paid in like, real closure can occur.  Until then, it requires hours and hours of praying and repetition of Christian  cliche&rsquo;s to live with it or forgiveness even after it is granted.</p>

<p>False. Jesus gave the promise of salvation to only one of the thieves, not to both. He said, &#8220;I say unto thee, today shalt thou be with me&hellip;&#8221; not &#8220;I say unto you, today shall ye be with me&hellip;.&#8221; The pronouns are singular not plural.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand the Christian bashing on this page. This story is about an ongoing race war against whites. The racist black murderers do not care if we are white Christians, white atheists or white Buddhists. As a Christian, I can forgive someone who has harmed me but it does not mean I must forget or be naive. If I loan you money and you don&rsquo;t pay it back, I can forgive you, but don&rsquo;t ever expect me to loan you money again. If blacks go around killing whites, I can forgive, but don&rsquo;t expect me to go around unarmed. And don&rsquo;t expect me to not be distrustful, suspicious and on alert with every black I encounter. Forgiveness, in terms of the victims families, is so that they themselves are not consumed with hatred and anger. Our responses to such crimes must be well thought out and reasoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And on he goes, failing to explain how Rome utilized Christianity to reconquer Europe, causing wars, deaths and suffering&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Because the history of Europe, and particularly Rome, wasn&rsquo;t already a story with much conquest, war, and suffering. </p>
<p>Pagan Romans conquered to the north of Britain, to the edge of Russia, and all around the Mediterranean. Before that though,  Pagan Gauls had come down and pillaged Greece and Greek Anatolia, and  had sacked the infant Rome. After Christianity, the Jacobite, Bolshevik, and Hitlerite groups all had their Reigns of Terror. </p>
<p>&#8220;Christian writers such as Paul were pretty clear about what was intended BEFORE the Romans got control of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes but I don&rsquo;t care what certain writers intended before the Romans &#8220;got control of it&#8221;. As I said before, I don&rsquo;t consider the New Testament to have been the final word. And as I said, I don&rsquo;t believe the Roman&rsquo;s &#8220;got control of it&#8221; but that they were given control by Christ. Thus the Romans became the chosen people of God- previously, as you pointed out, the Jews had this honor. </p>
<p>Note that under Constantine, the capital of the Empire was moved from Rome to &#8216;Nova Roma&#8221;- New Rome or Constantinople. This is part of why I consider the claims of primacy made by the Roman Catholic Church to be false. The State Church of the Roman Empire split into West (Latin) and East (&#8220;Romioi&#8221; or Greek) Churches. Overall, I consider the Western Church to have lapsed into such heresy that they can no longer be recognized as proper heirs to the Roman Church.  </p>
<p>On the question of universality and race, let me first be clear that I consider there to be one God who is the God of all humanity. This God is responsible for having created different species of animals and different races of humanity. </p>
<p>I would argue against Jefferson and Lincoln that no, God did not create all men equal. That is the real self-evident truth. </p>
<p>My Christian-European ancestors were against race-mixing. Unlike the liberal doctrines, created recently, I believe that tradition was in fact the correct one. </p>
<p>The liberals, of course, would respond that my ancestral Christian Europeans were insufficiently Christian. And I reject that argument on its face and take the inverse position. </p>
<p>Of course, charity and compassion are duties for a Christian. But is it charity to reward sin, as the modern welfare system and our aid to Africa does? If a Christian is promoting sin and vice through his charity and compassion, he is not doing the work of God.</p>
<p>Liberalism, like Satanism, perverts Christian ideas to do the work of Satan. </p>
<p>&#8220;But it also tells its followers to be childlike and like sheep, follow the shepherd. Is this the basis for a white survival movement?&#8221;</p>
<p>A fair question. But white survival is a temporal matter. Very simply, charity and compassion will not exist if white people do not exist; they are concepts not found in the cultures of other races. The work of God is dependent upon the survival of white people, the only people who have ever been capable of carrying the cross. </p>
<p>&#8220;The way it was used in Europe historically is not proof of its meaning,&#8221; </p>
<p>I say that it is.</p>
<p>&#8220;but its real history is one reason why this race realist cannot support its continued pretension as beneficial for whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am not a race-realist because out of an exclusive concern for whites. I am a race-realist because I consider the survival of whites to be essential for the survival of humanity, the Earth, and all of God&rsquo;s creation. <br>

<p>Everything is &#8220;Christian bashing&#8221; to you? READ the posts! Take your misguided &#8220;forgiveness/compassion&#8221; and lack of concern for the White race somewhere else. </p>

<p>Really? Does not the Good Book also say, there is a time for love and a time for HATE? In every season there is a time for peace and a time for WAR? A time to reap and a time to sow?</p>
<p>You go ahead and forgive all this black on White crime because I do not think God will or even intended for us to. Where is YOUR discernment?</p>
<p> That is the trouble with far too many WHITE Christians today, they do not even understand the WHO and WHAT God/Jesus is even talking about. BTW, WHO is your &#8220;neighbor&#8221;? Does it mean the one living next to you (black/brown etc?) or across the border? If you say yes, then it is YOU who hasn&rsquo;t a clue. What/who are those &#8220;nations&#8221; God speaks about? The whole world?</p>
<p>Your whole post reeks of God being a multicult, PC, metro male, love everybody, turn the other cheek to your enemies, a suicidal God who would have us roll over and die so people like you can &#8220;feel good&#8221; about their own pseudo-Christianity. Take the real over the fake.</p>
