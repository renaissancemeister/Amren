<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Queens District Attorney says a 15-year-old has been charged and arrested in connection with two sex attacks in Queens.</p>
<p>Police say there have been a total of five attacks in the last four weeks and they are still investigating whether the same teen is connected to the other attacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The victims in both attacks were hit in the head.</p>
<p>The teenage suspect has been charged with 2 counts of attempted rape, 1 count of attempted sex abuse, 1 count of sex abuse and assault.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Investigators say security cameras caught a suspect in Queens Village earlier this month right after he attacked a woman.</p>
<p>Each attack took place after dark, beginning Sept. 22 in Queens Village when police say a 44-year-old woman was sexually assaulted while walking home around 1 a.m.</p>
<p>A suspect struck again in Queens Village on Oct. 7, stalking and attacking his victim at 11 p.m. as she walked home. Two days later, police said he pushed a 40-year-old woman to the ground and beat her on 145th Road at 1:15 a.m.</p>
<p>The suspect&rsquo;s last two attacks were in Laurelton. First, police said he followed a 23-year-old woman leaving a bus stop at 11:35 p.m. on October 12.</p>
<p>Four days later, police said he struck again just a block away from the previous attack, hitting a 24-year-old woman on the back of her head before sexually assaulting her.</p>

		<p>I am still amazed that liberal young women think they have a &#8216;right&rsquo; to be out late at night, and that nothing bad should happen to them, even if they&rsquo;re drunk or dressed like a hoochie.  Liberalism is truly a disease of the mind.</p>

		<p>As a resident of NYC, I&rsquo;m familiar with Queens Village.  It is just another NYC neighborhood that&rsquo;s gone to pot, meaning, gone to &#8220;Black&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ll tell you though, I&rsquo;m just as interested in the &#8220;commercial&#8221; above.  The train in that commercial is a Long Island Railroad train.  Most of the people who ride the LIRR during rush hour are White.  You see, many hundreds of thousands of White people left the city, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, Manhattan for either Staten Island or Long Island from the 1950&rsquo;s onward to escape the Black wave into many neighborhoods.  </p>
<p>But back to the commercial above.  The commercial above is just another example of the media&rsquo;s relentless negative depictions of Whites.  We see above that a White Man leaves a suitcase on a LIRR train.  You will never see a depiction of a Black, Hispanic, Jew, woman or even the people who the media claims is most likely to be a terrorist - An Arab Muslim - depicted as a potential terrorist in a commercial like this.  It&rsquo;s ALWAYS A WHITE MAN.  It is never anyone else.  I think the commercial is even more relevant to Amren and the issues that we&rsquo;re facing right now. </p>

<p>They do. We live in wealthy country with a generous welfare state. There is no excuse whatsoever for crime of any sort. Women, elderly, handicap people, whatever, nobody should have to live in fear.</p>
<p>We should talk about Black rape until it becomes acceptable subject matter for discussion amongst &#8220;legitimate&#8221; media commentators and politicians.</p>
<p>Look at Philadelphia. The flash mob phenomena has reached such a crises level that even black liberal politicians had to enact sweeping curfew laws to stop black &#8220;youth&#8221; crime.<br>
 <br>
We need to push for castration or death penalty for rapists. Prison is simply 0 deterrent to certain sectors of the population who view it as a right of passage and a badge of honor. </p>

<p>Young women DO have a right to be out late at night and to be drunk or dressed whatever. It has nothing to do with being liberal. It&rsquo;s the criminals, such as this rapist, that should not be out at late at night or anywhere on the streets. Law abiding citizens, of either sex, should have the freedom to come and go as they please anytime, a right people of either sex used to have 100 years ago.</p>

<p>I believe that  a liberal or any type of person has the right to be out, and that nothing bad should happen to them. Even if I disagree with someone, I want them to be safe. The problem is that these white liberals support rights for criminals and ignore victims&rsquo; rights. They turn a deaf ear to any interracial crime statistic or any fact that challenges their agenda. Some are naive enough to enjoy &#8220;diverse&#8221; neighborhoods, only to become a victim themselves. I support zero tolerance and the expansion of the death penalty. That is the only way to stop crime. I sincerly hope that these liberal women in mini-skirts either become aware, or become piano teachers in North Dakota. </p>

		<p>Mature at an earlier age, and mature faster and more so when they do. And have that higher testosterone level that cannot be satiated. </p>

		<p>From that brief little article, what did we learn?<br>
15, teen, teen, minor, teenage, teen, just 15 years old.</p>
<p>Not one mention of race and at least 7 of age. Oh the poor minor teen just 15 years old. Likely didn&rsquo;t know who his father was and grew up disadvantaged in an institutionally racist society. The poor, poor dear.</p>
<p>The police sketches were shown after the arrest. One was an Black beyond all doubt who resembled the man in the surveillance video. The other was that most peculiar criminal, never caught yet we are assured that he exists: The coal dark police sketch with Caucasian features.</p>
<p>One quoted woman, possibly Vice President Biden in drag, said the following&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no job, nothing else to do.  So they&rsquo;re taking it out&hellip;ugh&hellip;every time I think about it, I&rsquo;m so disgusted,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Hmm. Pass that stimulus bill or &#8220;they&#8221; will get stimulated however they can. <br>

		<p>Nobody is going to mention the &#8216;Commercial&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Maybe others saw a different one.  What I saw was one of those &#8216;If you see something, say something&rsquo; White Demonization Propaganda ads, PAID FOR BY WHITE TAXPAYERS.  This one shows a well-dressed, well-groomed, young White man, leaving a suitcase on a train.</p>
<p>The guy had pinkish skin, and could not have been mistaken for an Arab.  White Demonization.  Paid for by you and me.  Very much like Hitler forcing the Jews to pay for their own &#8220;Relocation&#8221;.</p>

<p>Everyone has the &#8220;right&#8221; to be out late at night.  What about young women Drs, nurses, and other hospital workers, restaurant, hotel and theater workers, baby sitters, security guards, police officers, jail guards and everyone else who works a swing or night shift?</p>
<p>We have the right to be on the streets at all hours for any lawful purpose whether being called into the ER, coming home from a 3 to 11 pm shift or out socially.</p>
<p>It is the criminals who do not have the right to be on the streets.  Sunset laws prevented hundreds of thousands of rapes during the time they existed.</p>

		<p>The goon who raped Kelly McGillis was also 15 when he attacked her.  Emmett Till was 14 when he was killed in Mississippi after sexually assaulting Carolyn Bryant - Till had bragged to relatives in Mississippi about how easy it was to rape white women in Chicago (not coincidentally, Till&rsquo;s father had earlier been executed by the US army for the rape and murder of a white woman he had committed in Europe, which is why Till&rsquo;s mother was raising him on her own.)</p>
<p>Their higher testosterone levels and earlier sexual maturity means that some of them start young.</p>
<p>As for women having the right to be out on the streets at night, they do.  The problem isn&rsquo;t them; the problem is with who else is out on the streets at night.  When I was in Japan, far away from any US military bases, there were lots of young women - alone or in small groups - out late, in complete safety.  The missing ingredient of course was Africans.</p>
<p>The sunset laws mentioned by Margaret were effective in their day.  So, I imagine would handing the perps over to the male relatives of the victims; Till was permanently out of the rape business before his 15th birthday.</p>
