	<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Black individuals have been found to report the highest levels of self-esteem of any racial group in the United States. The purpose of the present research was to examine whether Black individuals also report higher levels of narcissism than White individuals. Study 1 (N = 367) found that Black individuals reported higher levels of narcissism than White individuals even when controlling for gender, self-esteem level, and socially desirable response tendencies. Study 2 (N = 967) and Study 3 (N = 315) found similar results such that Black individuals reported higher levels of narcissism than White individuals on the narcissism measures that captured less pathological facets of this construct. Study 3 also included indicators of psychological adjustment and found that the pathological aspects of narcissism were more strongly associated with maladjustment for Black individuals than for White individuals. The implications of these results for understanding the Black self-esteem advantage are discussed.</p>

I see all those self-esteem building programs in our public schools have been working.</p>
<p>Now that blacks have the highest self-esteem of any group, if the theory holds, they should surpass every other group in scholastic achievement.</p>
<p>That is, if the theory that high self-esteem produces high achieving students is true.<br>

		<p>This is a good jumping-of point to again rail against the disgusting practice of interracial sex.On the blog by Roissy,which many of you may read,they discussed the (bitter)truth that the male pathologcal narcissist is the personality that most attracts a woman.Black males are a worthless bunch,but capable of attracting white females,as they rae the most narcisistic and high &#8220;seff-esteem&#8221; of males.The end result we know all too well: mulatto children paid for by us. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Black individuals have been found to report the highest levels of self-esteem of any racial group in the United States&hellip; .  Black participants reported higher levels of narcissism than White participants. â–º The association between pathological narcissism and poor psychological adjustment was especially strong for Black individuals.&#8221;<br>
***********</p>
<p>The article seems to contradict itself.  It states that Blacks report the HIGHEST self-esteem of any racial group in the U.S.  Then it states that pathological narcissism and poor psychological adjustment was especially strong for Blacks.  There is no doubt that as a group they have over-blown egos.  I think every intelligent White person realizes that.  Their over-blown egos are an attempt to compensate for their innate inferiority complex with respect to Whites.  They know collectively at some deep level that they wish they were White, so they behave just the opposite of what they feel.  They also know that they can freely take their hostilities out on Whites as well.  Whites do not stand up for themselves in any confrontation with Blacks, either verbally or physically.  This is why they are running roughshod over Whites.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter that their narcissism is pathological.  They&rsquo;re getting away with it.  They&rsquo;re mugging us, driving us out of our neighborhoods, stealing our jobs, destroying our cities, raping our women, murdering us, stealing our women - and the bottom line is that these pathologically narcissistic, low IQ Blacks are in large part destroying our country.  Yeah, they may be pathologically narcissistic, but we&rsquo;re letting them get away with it and also with our country.</p>

<p>Gotta love the science.  Unless your narcissistic &#8220;self esteem&#8221; masks a deep seeded understanding of the fact that your race is statistically significantly less intelligent (as measured by IQ test after IQ test after IQ test), statistically significantly more likely to breed irresponsibly&hellip;cannot compete with most others as a group.  So you gotta have that self esteem, I suppose&hellip;</p>

		<p>Another way to state this, the obvious, is to call it arrested development.  Children are all about themselves, their wants, their demands, their pleasure, and RIGHT NOW thank you.  If they don&rsquo;t get their demands met, they often get destructive or violent.  Blacks are simply, by IQ, overgrown children.  What do you (or that is, we whites) do with children who act out like this?  That is exactly how blacks - both adult and children - should be treated.  AFter all, a black adult is just a physically grown to adult size child.<br>
Their IQ insures that.  Was a time pre-1960&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t mistake it - narcissistic personalities do not only feel great pride and importance in themselves, they find great personal shame in even the most menial of failings.  They tend to not over blow their involvement in any success, they take any perceived failure particularly hard.  So I don&rsquo;t think the study is wrong in saying that yes they do have big egos, but they also are prone to victim hood. </p>
<p>Perhaps their inability to handle failure as a result of their narcissistic personalities has something to do with their high rates of crime and violence and especially with their deflection of blame to outside forces (specifically white people), which they often turn in to the focus of their rage at their own failure.</p>

		<p> All you have to do is watch an NFL football to see this is true. Black players are always self-congradulating themselves over the littlest things they do on the field. Heck, they even had to put in a rule to keep your helmets on while you&rsquo;re on the field because they would take them off and mug for the camera constantly after making a play.</p>

		<p>Yes, Most comments are making a connection between narcissism and high self-esteem. There isn&rsquo;t one.</p>
<p>A true narcissist wears a mask to cover his horrendously low opinion of himself and this manifests itself in what we know as an outward display of narcissism.</p>
<p>Just imagine watching all your interactions as if you were outside of your body and you were studying the outcomes of your every move.<br>

<p>Narcissism is a personality trait, which everybody possesses to some degree:</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is a sense of self- importance. Even for a totally healthy individual, with empathy for and awareness of others, and a sense of objectivity and fairness, that individual must come first. That is, they must survive, so they must think first of their basic needs and motivations. This is why you&rsquo;ll hear therapists speak of &#8220;healthy levels of narcissism.&#8221; You need to put yourself first, or you can&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we see varying degrees of inappropriate narcissism: being selfish, thinking oneself to be overly important, and/ or believing others to be less significant in a pervasive way. <br>
This leads to the point where an actual PERSONALITY DISORDER is considered; where the individual feels ENTITLED, SPECIAL, EXCEPTIONAL, and BELIEVES, through and through, that they are BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE, and can thus DO AS THEY PLEASE, aka &#8220;Gibs Muh Dat.&#8221;</p>
<p>One hallmark of all personality disorders, especially Narcissistic personality disorder, is that they tend to cause OTHER PEOPLE more distress than the one diagnosed with the personality disorder.<br>
This is often because the disordered person tramples on the everyday rights and feelings of others, doing as they please, because they believe, as a simple matter of unquestioned fact, that they are above other people. <br>
We all have a set point where we just don&rsquo;t care about others; for healthy people, this is  only when we&rsquo;re at our wit&rsquo;s end, broken down, ready to explode or give up. For a true narcissist, or worse, a sociopath, this is a 24X7 mindset.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your typical black person, to a tee.<br>
It&rsquo;s so cool to see someone in the behavioral sciences is officially recognizing what a smart five year-old could tell everyone!</p>

		<p>Quite right, John. A Black could be a garbage man, a part time dope dealer, or just a layabout on SS. Nonetheless, he will walk, talk, and feel like a king. He will present himself this way to naive White Women and they will accept it as true. Black women tend to know better. </p>

<p>I was a Probation Officer before I had my children.  The criminals were virtually all black although the black percentage of the county was only 8 percent.</p>
<p>When I read Dr. Spock and other baby and childhood development books I realized what was wrong with blacks.  They are stuck at about 18 months old emotional development.</p>
<p>I I I I I  I want I need I need I want. Nothing else matters than the cookie or cartoon ow whatever it is they want right now.</p>
<p>The black rapists claimed that they could not control their urges long enough to get home to the women with whom they lived.<br>
The average black rapist justification for his rape is the same as a 2 year olds justification for grabbing a cookie or sparkly toy.  </p>
<p>I want I need.</p>
<p>My oldest child was more emotionally mature at 4 than most blacks ever are.<br>

<p>No, it is White feminist do gooder crusader cause women who are the most egotistical, arrogant narcissistic beings on the face of the planet.</p>
<p>One seldom sees White men claiming that Whites are a cancer on the face of the earth.  One seldom sees White male episcopal clergy advocating that Whites have no more childre and abort the ones on the way as White female episcopal priests do.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the pit bull lovers societies?  About 95 percent White women and a few henpicked husbands.  Who adopts africans?<br>
White women.  There are plenty of White male liberals who advocate the destruction of the White race.  But there are many, many more White women who advocate the destruction of the White race.</p>
<p>The liberal White women who advocate affirmative action, animal worship, earth worship and the abolition of the White race do it out of arrogance, narcissism, attention getting, and egotism.</p>
<p>The essence of their beings is superiority to both the downtrodden objects of their enlightened concern and the knuckle dragging White trash who don&rsquo;t go along with the White feminist agenda of self immolation of the White race.</p>
<p>White feminists and liberal women think of themselves as sort of Jesus or God figures leading the downtrodden objects of their concern to happiness forever and ever in heaven. <br>

<p>Thank you Sureesh, and thank you American Renaissance for continuing to publish Sureesh&rsquo;s many profound and varied comments. Each one continues to amaze and awe me to no end.  I have saved all of his posts on my hard drive for further, deeper reading and to share his wonderful commentary with others.</p>
<p>I, as a stupid, clueless white American, appreciate being &#8220;put in my place&#8221; constantly by Asian supremacists on a site about white issues.  Otherwise how would I know how superior, intelligent, humble and creative Indians are as compared to us brutish whites.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to know the money I pay for my AR subscription and the donations I&rsquo;ve made are being put to good use so Sureesh and other of his ilk can continue to have a forum where they can demean whites.  </p>
<p>Such a joy to read the comments on AR and come across <i>yet another post</i> by Sureesh. I appreciate that so many of his comments are posted and my inferior posts deleted.</p>
<p>Keep up the great work AR!</p>
<p><i>White men are the most egotisitcal, arrogant, self indulgent, narcisstic human beings on the face of the planet.</i></p>

		<p>Oh really Linda, your tirade sounds like a common ad hominem attack against white men just because they are white.  Blacks and Hispanics are by far the most egotistical, narcissistic and arrogant bunch I have ever met. I&rsquo;ve met some I wanted to strangle with my bare hands, they were that insufferable. But some white women I&rsquo;ve met are just as bad, which is why a growing number of them miscegnate with non-whites.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has spent much time around blacks knows this. Personally I often wonder if it is not some hidden over-compensated inferiority complex - a racial equivalent of a short man&rsquo;s Napoleon complex. Blacks as a race, have achieved very, very little, and this is true of blacks all over the world. Most blacks KNOW - but would never admit - that their race could never develop the civilization or economy they enjoy in the white countries they live in or move to. Many blacks are a mass of psychological contradictions.</p>

		<p>Mr. Jones asks about the definition of narcissism and what causes it. According to the criteria defined in the Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association, narcissism is a personality disorder. A personality disorder is &#8220;an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual&rsquo;s culture&#8221; and is &#8220;inflexible and pervasive.&#8221; Narcissistic Personality Disorder is marked by a number of diagnostic criteria, some of which are &#8220;a grandiose sense of self&hellip;requires excessive admiration&hellip;has a sense of entitlement&hellip;shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Studies have shown that the least competent (and presumably, least intelligent) people also have the highest opinion of themselves. Intelligent people are fully aware of their shortcomings. Low IQ people aren&rsquo;t, and never grasp how incompetent they are. They have high self-esteem because they cannot comprehend just how dull-witted they are compared to others. They think whites and other competent people made it to the top because of some undeserved luck or magic spells or some other nonsense. </p>

		<p>Thanks to 18 for pointing out the obvious, that narcissist is NOT!!!! synonymous with high self-esteem.</p>
<p>Many narcissists are plagued by devastating inferiority complexes.</p>
<p>The loud, obnoxious, arrogant, aggression often observed in blacks in their relations with whites may be a mechanism they have developed for compensating for their shortcomings.</p>
<p>If scientists were not straitjacketed by political correctness, we would already have reliable statistics for the following question:</p>
<p>are blacks aware of just how mentally limited they are compared to most whites?</p>
<p>How many blacks realize that their own cognitive limitations, and not racism, keep them from reaching the higher echelons of society (except as affirmative action ornaments?)</p>
<p>How many bright blacks are aware of the fact that the vast majority of blacks are far below them mentally?</p>
<p>As long as these questions are off-limits, we will be unable to talk about the PURPOSE of black narcissism and bragging:</p>
<p>as a coping mechanism for surviving in white society, where most of blacks are accurately perceived as less mentally developed than average.</p>

		<p>John, #5 @ 5:57 i right.  Perhaps black males have High &#8220;self  esteem&#8221; because they  succeed sexually.  That is  their role model for success.<br>
In the matter of miscegenation what was once a major, perhaps the major issue of white  consciousness, from 1675 to World War II it is now dead.  Even  white conservative groups have replaced it with immigration.  Perhaps they have  realized that there is now no turning back on the acceptance of sex between black males and white females.     Forget about marriage; how many white woman have had babies by black men in the last ten years.  No one seems to know; but it is clearly more, many more, then the 10 years before.</p>

<p>The psychological Nathaniel Branden   &mdash;   one of a tiny minority within the headshrinking profession worth paying attention to   &mdash;   drew a distinction between self-esteem and self-respect. And it is a CRUCIAL distinction. </p>
<p>When three-year-old Timmy stomps around the kitchen banging a saucepan with a wooden spoon and repeating &#8220;I am so great!&#8221; that little tot has PLENTY of self-esteem. It may not be founded in anything, and in a few years he&rsquo;ll grow out of it, but if self-esteem is what you&rsquo;re looking for, then little Timmy is your boy. But the more important matter of self-RESPECT   &mdash;   which nobody can simply bestow upon himself but which must be EARNED   &mdash;   is not yet on the radar. After a few more years, Timmy will have learned that, compared to all the other people he&rsquo;s now met, maybe he&rsquo;s NOT the greatest person in the world after all. He will grow up, and his ego will shrink to a level more reflective of his skills and abilities. He&rsquo;ll find that he&rsquo;s good at some things, and not at others, and his rampant self-esteem will develop into a more moderated self-respect. He&rsquo;ll respect himself for the things he does well, while trying to improve in areas where he now knows he doesn&rsquo;t stack up so well against others. </p>
<p>Well, if Timmy&rsquo;s WHITE, that is. If he&rsquo;s black, he might not ever get over it, but rather grow up to be as narcissistic and self-involved and immature as he was as a toddler. </p>
<p>We hear this surfeit of meaningless, groundless, almost-entirely-imaginary &#8220;self-esteem&#8221; in the relentless boasting of hip-hop: every single rapper goes on an on about how he&rsquo;s &#8220;the pimp of the microphone&#8221; and &#8220;best of the best&#8221; and &#8220;beats all them other sucka MCs&#8221; etc. It&rsquo;s all perfectly ridiculous, of course, and means precisely nothing. But because their audience validates these ludicrous claims for them, the rapper gets positive reinforcement (through applause and record sales) for his egomania, and therefore has no incentive to stop. Or even to tone it down a little.  </p>
<p>It is, I believe, much the same way   &mdash;   albeit on a smaller scale   &mdash;   with the average African-American. After 50 years of being reassured that they are not only equal to, but BETTER THAN white people, it&rsquo;s only natural that they have, as a group, internalized these delusions. If black people today are the most narcissistic   &mdash;   as this and many previous studies have clearly demonstrated    &mdash;   it is partly the fault of their own low IQs, but also partly the fault of white liberals for having inflated their sense of self-worth far beyond what the evidence (or common sense) would allow. </p>

		<p>Yeah, Linda, White men are bad, that&rsquo;s why women from other countries love em so much.  Most White men are nice, take us to dinner, consult us on important manners, share money, support their kids, etc. Most Black men beat their women, verbally abuse them, have not an ounce of romance in them. Show up for booty calls only, never take a woman to dinner. And you can forget about them being faithful or takng care of their kids. You have been watching too much Mad Men. I can count the good Black men I have known on one hand, and it makes me sad to say it and they were older guys from the South.</p>

		<p>If blacks dominated baseball the way they do basketball and football you would quickly notice the following.  The black shortstop fields a routine grounder and easily throws out the runner.  Following the play he does a celebration dance that carries him all about the infield.  He would woot and holler and lob profanities and taunts at the opposing duggout.  All after a very routine play.  Think not?  What do they do at the end of a mediocre four yard pass reception or a routine tackle after a the opponent gets a respectable five yard gain?  They do not do this in baseball because their numbers are low and that sort of nonsence isn&rsquo;t tolorated.  They are kept in check.  Once they have superior numbers it would all change.  Hmmm?  Just like society?  </p>

		<p>A couple of people above have mentioned football vis-a-vis black narcissism.  </p>
<p>There was a story over the weekend that gained a bit of traction in the lamestream sports media and in lamestream conservative media:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/qdHYh" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/qdHYh</a></p>
<p>The angle that most are taking with this story is that we&rsquo;re getting too wussified.  </p>
<p>The problem with that theory is that football is probably the only venue left where boys and men can still be boys and men   &mdash;   Other than the occasional feminist ideologue or the occasional Title IX enforcement bureaucrat, there is no whining about football.  Mainly because it&rsquo;s so black dominated, as an aside.</p>
<p>So there has to be something else at work.</p>
<p>When you dig down into the story, you find out that the &#8220;Madre Hill Rule&#8221; has been in effect for a long time, and only applies to fifth and sixth grade teams.  Too many people are walking away with the impression that they just came up with the rule because of young Mr. Jimerson&rsquo;s &#8220;prodigious talent.&#8221;  Wrong   &mdash;   This rule has been in effect for around 20 years, and Jimerson is just the first one to run up against it in all the years it has been in effect.</p>
<p>First off, I think it&rsquo;s a good rule, especially for younger children, because team sports at that age are supposed to be teaching tools.  You don&rsquo;t want one individual ego upsetting the apple cart.  Too, it&rsquo;s 5th and 6th grade amateurs we&rsquo;re talking about here, I highly doubt Jimerson needs to pad his stats because he&rsquo;s in a contract year.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the big white elephant in the room   &mdash;   Race.  It&rsquo;s just an instinctual guess on my part, but I get the feeling that the reason the &#8220;Madre Hill Rule&#8221; exists (Madre Hill was also black) was that this league or district was trying to douse water all over the flames of the narcissism of young black men, and the inevitable fights and hard feelings that would have resulted in, for example, an 11-year old running back scoring seven rushing touchdowns in a game his team was already winning by 70 points.  It is for the same reason that the NFL really doesn&rsquo;t like excessive endzone celebration   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re worried that one of the blacks is going to get too full of himself, celebrate &#8220;the wrong way,&#8221; hurt someone&rsquo;s feelings on the defense, (&#8220;he dissed me,&#8221;) and the whole thing gets resolved with the business end of a pistol.</p>
<p>Somehow, I doubt I&rsquo;m really making myself clear, so I&rsquo;ll stop.<br>

You&rsquo;re probably right, in that White males would have more extreme scores - a wider standard deviation (males are usually more extreme - have more variability - on most measures) so that many white males would score high on narcissism &amp; many low - &amp; that even though the Black mean was higher on narcissism than the White mean, in terms of actual people one meets every day, you may meet more narcissistic White males (due to sheer #&rsquo;s &amp; larger standard deviation), but that doesn&rsquo;t disprove the idea of overlapping normal distributions with different means for each group &amp; the Black mean being higher than the White mean. <br>

		<p>@ Linda The burden of proof is on you as the research given disagrees with you and whites are almost always the ones who are the middle of the road among the races. NEVER one extreme (i.e. dysfunctionality) of behavior or another. Men perhaps (something like 80% of clinically assessed casesof narcissistic personalities are male). But it would just, unless you have a lot of experience with non-white males intimately, be a natural BIAS on your part to loathe those you do have experience with  whites.  In the end the conclusion is clear: this clinically narcissistic esteem is very, very, very not good and to be avoided.</p>

		<p>Intelligent people have more capacity for introspection and self-reflection. They can more easily identify mistakes and shortcomings and admit to them. This can often lead to self-doubt. Lower I.Q. people simply don&rsquo;t have this capacity and so tend to remain child-like in their inflated sense of themselves. In other words, they simply don&rsquo;t know enough to know any better. They are simply not smart enough to know they are neither smart or special. But there seems to be something MORE with blacks. Some cultural or genetic missing puzzle piece that makes them particularly subject to this. I worked with a black guy who was a total loser, but he thought he was the last word. Just today I was at a shopping mall and there were five black women standing in the middle of the hallway. They were all obese and at least 200 feet from me. I could hear every word they said as they guffawed and cackled away like school children.</p>
<p>To Sureesh:  Humble people don&rsquo;t go around boasting to others about how &#8220;humble&#8221; they are. You have unwittingly contradicted yourself and shown yourself for a pompous dimwit.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Linda is necessarily being anti-white male. Unfortunately human reality is that these kinds of traits in males are attractive to females and is also why black males are so influential. The dark triad traits are what is attractive to women and men (for women to mate with and men to imitate), these personality traits are narcissism, machiavellianism, psychopathy, egotist, psychopathic liar, self-centeredness, exploitative, manipulative and deceitful. These traits draw women like a moth to a light. White men have been living in civilization for so long that they ignore their instincts and do what is best for civilized society. These are good things of course but it puts us at a massive disadvantage givin our current situation. White men have always been on top as well and what comes with that is ignorance. Like the Guns N&rsquo; Roses song &#8220;The Garden&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9e77IrHBsw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9e77IrHBsw</a> &#8220;Only poor boys take a chance on the garden song and dance&#8221;. We are not poor enough in other words&hellip;Yet anyway.</p>
<p>Black males were forced to understand this right after the sexual revolution but with us it has taken MUCH more time. Theres a big trick being played on white men world wide, and its like having a tiger by the tail, if they let go they are finished. Understanding among the white male population is what will cause the sleeping giant to awake.</p>

<p><i>I disagree with this. White men are the most egotisitcal, arrogant, self indulgent, narcisstic human beings on the face of the planet.</i></p>
<p>Linda, I disagree with what you&rsquo;ve said. First, it&rsquo;s a blanket accusation, which is never a good way to begin an argument. Second, the fact that some White men are this way does not negate the fact that Blacks were found to have a higher propensity toward narcissism.</p>
<p>Are <b>some</b> White men egotistical, arrogant, self-indulgent, and narcissistic? Yes. In fact, I dated one. And on top of it, he had Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which I didn&rsquo;t realize until I started to do some research on it. I was amazed by what I discovered and count myself blessed that the relationship ended before I became trapped in a never-ending cycle of emotional abuse. Narcissists are famous for &#8220;seeming&#8221; like great guys   &mdash;   until they don&rsquo;t get their way or you challenge their viewpoint. I was verbally abused and the mind-games were unbelievable as this man constantly dallied with other women and taunted me with that fact.</p>
<p>Narcissists use people like a drug. Something snapped in them when they were younger, which could be a reason why they act like a spoiled (and scared) toddler, constantly scheming and manipulating people to do their bidding.</p>
<p>I wish I could read the rest of the study that is linked in the above article. All I can do is share a personal story. </p>
<p>In one of the jobs I had during the year I met my husband-to-be, a Black man worked the same shift and would often chat with me. I was friendly and enjoyed light banter, but that was it. I was appalled when he shared with me that he had a mistress and how well she &#8220;treated&#8221; him than his own wife. I told him he had issues. He&rsquo;d just laugh and thought of himself as a true &#8220;playa.&#8221; In fact, he bragged to me that he could &#8220;have me&#8221; if he wanted. </p>
<p>I looked him straight in the eye and said with every ounce of steel in my bones, &#8220;No. You. Could. Not.&#8221; He claimed he could. I looked at him and said, &#8220;First, I&rsquo;m not interested. Not even a smidgen. Second, you&rsquo;re an adulterer. You&rsquo;re already married and you need to work on some things with your wife rather than tom-cat it around because you think it proves something.&#8221;</p>
<p>He just shook his head and smiled but thankfully, not long after, my husband proposed and I left that position to move to my husband&rsquo;s hometown as his new wife. And I do have a wonderful husband who treats me like a queen and I treat him like a king. Respecting one another is a part of love. Treating people with dignity is part of love. Narcissism is a one-way street where the narcissist drains the life out of the one used. But Linda, not all White men are like that and I daresay, many of the men here on AmRen are gentlemen who are shocked that White women would continue to be drawn to Black men who abuse them. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not denial by a long shot. That&rsquo;s reality.<br>

		<p>How ironic that the most illiterate, backward and degenerate race among all the races, has the highest (delusional) self-esteem. In the world of the African, failing to even have invented the Wheel and living in dung huts; while Rome was at it height, is simply &#8220;the man&#8221; keeping them down.</p>

		<p>I was watching this TV show called PROS VERSUS JOES, ex-professional athletes compete with &#8216;regular&rsquo; guys in sporting and athletic events. One involved a swimming contest. One of the contestants was black. He had rated himself a 9 out of 10 for swimming proficiency on a chart sheet the contestants fill out before the show begins. Once he entered the pool, he couldn&rsquo;t even tread water. The host I believe then said he should have been a 1 or a zero. I suspect a lot of blacks think this way. They assume they have an ability or skill they don&rsquo;t because of how inflated their sense of self-worth is. </p>

To Linda 51<br>
Think or feel what you like, you are a free minded adult after all. <br>
You just won&rsquo;t find a sympathetic audience here though to your specific assertions.<br>
The most wonderful thing about Amren&rsquo;s underlying philosophy is that no one here would ever dream of forcing you to live, work or study in close proximity with your most despised of groups (or face the indignity of having to underwrite their expansion).</p>
<p>As I see it, after putting aside the desire to defend my own demographic and &lsquo;correct you&rsquo;, your biases are no better or worse than mine, but are in fact equal to mine. </p>
<p>Would you agree with this or do you think that your biases come from a higher place? <br>
I&rsquo;m sincerely curious</p>

		<p>One thing I have always noticed about narcissistic men is cowardice. I have never known a black man that wasn&rsquo;t a coward, and white men under 50 do not know just how big of cowards black men really are. White men my age (30) seem to be scared to death of them.</p>
<p>I grew up around them and I know how they are, they are full of it. They are naturally submissive and cowards and if you want to know how to deal with them watch this video. </p>

So says our resident Indo-supremacist denizen who reminds us daily just how oh-so-smart and cultured his people are while forgetting that the countries his people have spawned are festering cesspits of dysfunction, intolerance and despair.

		<p>All right, enough said about Narcissistic personality disorder-how about other charming personality disorders freqently found in blacks, and I believe more so than the general population, such as sociopathic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and histrionic personality disorder.  I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, nor do I pretend to be, but having been around plenty of blacks in an industry I used to be in, and now thankfully out of, I sure saw other behavioural patterns besides narcissism.  Even though psychologists are bound by PC junk, having been all over the world including Africa, I daresay blacks are the most dysfunctional people on the face of the planet!</p>
