<h1>Russian Parliament Adopts Law Restricting Abortions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Google News, October 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Russia&rsquo;s parliament adopted a law Friday limiting abortions but rejected even tougher restrictions backed by the country&rsquo;s conservative Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Health officials say Russia&rsquo;s abortion rates are among the world&rsquo;s highest, contributing to a fertility rate of only 1.4 children per woman  &mdash;  far below the 2.1 needed to maintain the existing population. The country&rsquo;s birth rate has become a serious concern for Russia as it fights to stem a steep population decline.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry says more than a million pregnancies are terminated in Russia annually, although abortion critics say the statistics don&rsquo;t include private clinics and the real number amounts to six million a year.</p>
<p>The law passed Friday limits abortions to 12 weeks of pregnancy, except for women who say they can&rsquo;t afford a child, who may have an abortion up to 22 weeks. The law also stipulates a mandatory waiting period of two to seven days before the procedure to allow a woman to reconsider her decision.</p>

		<p>The last paragraph is enough to see that the law will be ineffective. A traditional family and a society where men &amp; women don&rsquo;t compete solves everything and the sooner this and similar legislation all fail, the sooner Moscow will reverse Modernity because Putin won&rsquo;t let Russians die out, so it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before this great reversal becomes the last &amp; only option. </p>

		<p>During the Cold War the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites had the highest abortion rates in the world.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the reason Russia and the rest of the white world is in trouble demographically. Still, this new law is a step in the right direction.</p>

		<p>Abortion is sad. These babies could have grown up to be anything in the world, but some would prefer to scrape them out and throw them in the trash like a used kleenex. Adoption seems like such a better idea in the case of an unwanted pregnancy.</p>

How heartbreaking is that? Russians are some of the most attractive people in the world in my opinion. I used to work with two Russian women who were in their late 50&rsquo;s and early 60&rsquo;s and they were still very handsome women, and you could just tell they must have been breathtaking in their 20&rsquo;s. The thought of losing so many beautiful children breaks my heart.</p>

		<p>Until the Orthodox Church in Russia and the Catholic Church in the West are able to influence public opinion to overturn all laws permitting abortion (and birth control), the birthrate of whites will continue to decline. It is our use of birth control and our killing of the unborn which has led to our need for widespread immigration. <br>

		<p>My main motivation for opposing abortion is actually based more on morality than on demographics.  But still, I&rsquo;m delighted to hear abortion will be more restricted in Russia.</p>

		<p>A high percentage of young men in a country is destabilizing, and the ultimate reason for Islamic terrorism. The low percentage of young men in Russia, caused by the low birth rate, is a reason the Soviet Union fell with little violence. <br>
 <br>
When the birth rate in Latin America was higher right wing dictatorships fought with left wing revolutionary movements. Now that the birth rate has declined, the countries in Latin America are developing democratic governments.  </p>

		<p>I never thought that I would be offering the Duma my congratulations, but this is good news and a step in the right direction. Too bad they didn&rsquo;t take the stronger medicine recommended by the Church. Anyway, at least this reflects an awareness of Russia&rsquo;s suicide demographics and some political will toward self-preservation. Pray for a nationalist awakening in all of Europe and North America!</p>

____</p>
<p>Central and Eastern Europeans are really the most attractive of whites as you mentioned (Russia with Hungary and Slovakia in my opinion) with extreme degree of racial homogeneity and their numbers are all declining.<br>
How great would be extra 6 mil Russian children..<br>
Sad.</p>

		<p>It might help to do interviews with women to learn what the reasons are that prompted them to seek abortions.  Before you can heal the illness you have to find the cause of the disease.  </p>
<p>I am surprised that they only have 143 million people with such a huge land mass.</p>
