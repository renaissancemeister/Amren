		<p>&#8220;Asian&#8221;, for those americans not familiar with british terms, means iraqis, pakistanis and the like, not chinese and japanese.</p>

		<p>As a commentator noted above, the Brits use &#8220;Asian&#8221; for what we Yanks call &#8220;Middle Eastern.&#8221; (I don&rsquo;t know if they also use it for who we call East Asians or SE Asians.) AmRen&rsquo;s editor may want to make it a habit to put that as a note on every British news item where Asian is used in that manner. </p>

		<p>These are muslim South Asians (Pakistanis) not Arabs.</p>

		<p>The attackers are most likely Pakistanis rather than Arabs, as the tag-line says.<br>
 Actually Arabs are not very numerous in Britain.</p>

		<p>Just another day in glorious multiracial England. So sad that all those Tommies went over the top so that Britain could end up like this. </p>

		<p>Asian no longer refers to the Mongoloid race any more than European refers to the Caucasian race.  I don&rsquo;t mean among us so to speak but within the field of media, academia, and global politics.  At least India and Pakistan are located on the continent of Asia.<br>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t describe the attack as &#8220;racist&#8221; because anti-racist is just a code word for anti-white. I would describe the attack as anti-white.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Asian&#8221; is never used to refer to Arabs or Iraqis in the UK.  It does NOT mean &#8220;Middle Eastern.&#8221;  It only refers people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese   and the like are referred to as &#8220;Orientals&#8221; in the UK.  </p>
<p>The headline should be changed. </p>

		<p>No one is Demanding Africa, India, China, or Japan be flooded with millions of people, that are not of their race and are telling everyone to &#8220;mix in&#8221;, until the targeted group is blended out of existence. </p>
<p>Funny how it is only White nations these so called &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; are doing this to, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>It is Genocide.</p>
<p>Anti-racist is a code word for anti-White. <br>

		<p>So Amren is just going to let false information that libels an ethnic group stand ?  I gotta wonder what the agenda here is that wants to pin the deeds of Pakistanis on Arabs.  </p>
