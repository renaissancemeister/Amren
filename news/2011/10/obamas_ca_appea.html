			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Larry Gerston, NBC Los Angeles, October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama may be slipping in the polls elsewhere, but the changing complexion of California&rsquo;s population is likely to serve him well in 2012 election.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most people know that Obama captured an overwhelming share of the African-American vote in 2008; in California, 94 percent of all African-Americans voted for the Democrat. But that&rsquo;s not the important part of the story, because African-Americans account for only 6 percent of the state&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>The most significant numbers lie with Latinos and Asian-Americans. Latinos gave a lopsided 74 percent of their vote to Obama in the 2008 election. Between 2000 and 2010, the Latino population in California grew by 28 percent, indicating a much larger political presence for this group in 2012. Latinos today account for about 38 percent of the state&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Asian-Americans in California voted for Obama by an almost two-to-one margin in 2008; their segment of the state&rsquo;s population soared by 32 percent during the past decade. Asian-Americans now account for 13 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, up from 10 percent in 2000.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the percentage of non-Hispanic Whites in California has decreased over the past decade to 40 percent from 47 percent in 2000. This segment voted for Obama by the slim margin of 52 percent to 46 percent for Republican opponent John McCain. </p>
<p>Of course, percentages of the population do not equate with percentages of voters. Thus, in 2008, non-Hispanic Whites cast 65 percent of all votes. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If nothing else, these dispositions should be a wake-up call for California Republicans. Clearly, relying on Whites alone is a losing proposition in light of the state&rsquo;s demographic direction.</p>

		<p>The recent Solyndra scandal was almost a matter of Solyndra being nothing more than a &#8220;solar energy&#8221; smokescreen and front for laundering Federal funds to the California Democrat Party.</p>
<p>What is mind boggling about that is this:  Why bother giving a dime to the California Democrat Party?  They will win everything that matter is California by default, just because of demographics.  Look at last year, a red wave election year - Not a single Congressional seat changed parties, and Democrats won pretty much all the statewide offices.</p>

<p>The first sentence is correct.  The second sentence, however, is highly misguided.  The solution to these disparaging facts is not for Republicans to capitulate to Hispanic demands, but rather to do everything in their power to reverse the situation, and get as many whites as possible on their side.</p>

		<p>No GOP candidate in the last 40 years has been able to attain even a simple majority of the Hispanic vote and there is absolutely no reason to think one ever will. Simply put, Hispanics will never vote in appreciable numbers for a party that advocates &#8220;limited government&#8221; because of their below average academic performance and their pervasively higher rates of poverty and welfare use. And there is good reason to believe that their below average academic performance has a genetic component. American Indians consistently average below whites and Asians on intelligence tests and most Mexicans have at least some Indian ancestry. If there is no link between IQ and success in life someone needs to explain to me why the entertainment political and business elites in Mexico are much whiter in appearance than the illegals wading across the southern border. Because if white, mestizo and Indian Mexicans do have the same average intelligence these disparities must be the result of widespread racial discrimination against individuals who appear to be more indigenous. Why are the so-called &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; MIA on this? </p>

<p>Same thing with blacks.  Most of them love big government, hate whites, hate the US, think white taxpayers have their money, love hate crime laws that favor blacks over whites, love the fact govt coddles them, etc.  All of this was done for blacks by having bigger and bigger government.  That&rsquo;s why blacks love liberals and will never vote for conservatives.  James Edwards mentioned that in Racism Schmacism, which I highly recommend you get a copy of.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s true, but, like with black republicans, they will stabbed the GOP in the back and constantly accused their own GOP of being racists, even though they elected them in.  These &#8216;hispanic republicans&rsquo; will do nothing about making English the national language, they&rsquo;ll do nothing about stopping the border, they&rsquo;ll give breaks and deals to hispanics.  Even a hispanic conservative woman on Fox is whining about how things are anti-hispanic.  This is why I want the GOP to be a conservative white party as we don&rsquo;t share the same values on how the country should be run.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Asian-Americans in California voted for Obama by an almost two-to-one margin in 2008; their segment of the state&rsquo;s population soared by 32 percent during the past decade. Asian-Americans now account for 13 percent of the state&rsquo;s population, up from 10 percent in 2000.&#8221;</p>
<p>How&rsquo;s that wonderful average 105 IQ for only 3 asian nations, <br>
China, Korea and Japan and officially low crime rate, going to help White Americans survive Messrs Taylor, Rushton, Sailor and Englemann?  Of course the unofficial crime rate from drug, sex and slave trafficing, extortion, tax evasion, business fraud of every kind and other white collar crimes is very high.</p>
<p>But since asian victims of their tribal members extortion and other crimes are killed if it is reported the crimes never appear in the official statistics.</p>
<p>I know, I know, average IQ of 3 countries is the only thing that matters.  White americans are too stupid to learn programming, systems design, engineering and even medicine.  White children do not vacumm up advanced trig and calcalus in high school.  White college students socialize on weekend nights instead of studying 18 hours per day.</p>
<p>We cant&rsquo; survive without these genius asians, especially the Drs, dentists, therapists and pharmacists who are the most overrepresented group in medical insurance fraud, surpassing even the armenians and russians.</p>
<p>Best advice for Whites: Change your last name to a hispanic one.</p>
<p>I know that asians in California voted against anti affirmative action Prop 209 in numbers as high as hispanics and blacks.</p>

<p>California is still either the 7th or 8th biggest economy in the world.  In 100 years when it is totally Hispanic Indian it will be on life support.</p>
<p>California and Mexico are actually equal in resources.  Mexico has something of an advantage in that it has marvelous natural harbors on both the Atlantic and Pacific.</p>
<p>Mexico could have developed like pre 1980 California.  The Hispanic population of California is more Indian every day.</p>
<p>Someday California might look not like the more civilized sections of Mexico but like the poorest mountain and jungle villages.</p>
<p>When the last Whites are gone, California will be dead.  But it will take a while.</p>
<p>I think the Aztecs had better water and irrigation systems than Mexico has today.</p>

<p>A lot of them are not Spanish but descendants of several million Irish and German immigrants to Mexico in the 19th and early 20th century.  The part Irish elites are mostly descendants of the Irish brought over to build the 19th century railroads.</p>
<p>All those Mexican beers so popular in America come from breweries started by German immigrants and still owned by their descendants.</p>
<p>S. America and Mexico were as popular a destination for European immigrants as the US in the 19th century.</p>

		<p>This is news?  Gerson is some sort of researcher investigator for coming up with something that has been obvious to anyone for the last 50 years?</p>
<p>Asians voted overwhelmingly against Prop 209 the anti affirmative action law.  James Rogan and other proponents of Prop 209 spent a lot of time and money pointing out that Asians suffer from affirmative action in college applications.  It was a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Asians know that once out of college, an Asian always gets a job<br>
instead of a much better qualified White in accord with the laws of affirmative action.</p>
<p>People who think that Asians with high SAT scores and good grades are discriminated against in college admissions in California are wrong.</p>
<p>The college admissions people give the most weight to the &#8220;poor, poor pitiful me&#8221; essay than tests, grades and activities combined.  The title of the essay is usually My struggle and the biggest difficulty of my life and how I overcame it.</p>
<p>Whatever a non White downloads from the internet is deemed to out weigh grades and test scores.</p>
<p>Whites who praise Asian immigrants are fools.  Replacement and genocide are replacement and genocide, whether it is done by blacks, Asians or Mexican Indians.<br>

		<p>The more minorities you have in a state the more likely it will be a blue state. With the growing Hispanic population more red states will be turning blue forever. It would be interesting to see a map of the U.S. and see how many states are hopelessly blue and how many more states the Dems need to become the only party for national elections. I believe Texas, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Ohio will become blue in the not to distant future. They will join New York, Illinois, Michigan, Massachusetts, California and so on. When this happens Democrats will have a lock on all elections. That is why the Dems want an open border. If these immigrants happened to be Republican, see how fast the border would be sealed.</p>

		<p>As late as 1970 California was 80% white. It was once renowned for its hordes of white teenagers. At 20% total for ALL non-whites, it was considered an unusually diverse state at the time. California&rsquo;s economic decline and decay is undoubtedly related to this invasion of non-whites.</p>

		<p>California is the most populous state in the union and it&rsquo;s such a lock for Democrats that none of the candidates for president ever even show up to campaign.  It&rsquo;s a waste of money for both parties.  If we Californians vote for ballot initiatives, the powers that be use the courts to overturn them in heartbeat if they contradict the liberal worldview.  If you&rsquo;re a conservative, why even bother voting?  It&rsquo;s like &#8220;voting&#8221; in Cuba.<br>
This is what our Democracy has come to.<br>

		<p>From first place to 43rd from the bottom in just a few decades, us Californians have realized one of the greatest falls of any great political state (country or state) in such a short period of time. We&rsquo;re so blue we might just pass irreversibly into last place within a just one more decade. </p>
<p>I fought it but few here did. The Republicans went hog wild exploiting the illegal alien labor for profit while the Democrats exploited it for political clout. What a mess it is today. </p>

<p>You are so right.  The excellent and free California public school system was a major reason the aircraft and technological industry located here from 1940 to about 1970.  The idea was that the excellent schools would produce generations of excellent engineers and skilled workers for those industries.</p>
<p>Liberals love Los Angeles now because it is a crime ridden minority mess with vast slums, periodic black riots, overcrowded free medical clinics and a horrible school system. This gives liberals lots of jobs blaming the Whites who have fled California for the mess the state is in.</p>
<p>But right up to the 1964 Watts riots, liberals hated Los Angeles because with cheap housing it had few slums.  Land was so cheap the average low wage worker could buy a 1/4 acre and build his own house.  It had the highest rate of home ownership in the nation.  There were jobs for everyone.</p>
<p>When he ran for another term as Mayor in 1960 Mayor Sam Yorty said &#8221; people criticize Los Angeles for being too bland and middle class and boring, but we have the best big city school system in the country.&#8221;  That was very true.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember sometime in the early 1950&rsquo;s my parents saying that California public schools were number 1 in the nation.</p>
<p>The grandchildren live in Cupertino, some of the few Whites in their school.  And yes Englemann, Jennifer and Sureesh, they are keeping up with the Asian geniuses with no difficulty.</p>
<p>Of course their other grandmother taught their mother Calculus when she was 15 so genetics might have something to do to keeping up with the Asian geniuses.</p>
<p>Their parents and I are not planning on college for them.  The discrimination is so bad here in California that a degree is useless for Whites.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll spend the money on a fast food franchise. The kids can take business classes at community college.</p>
<p>It is truly sad.  My first visit to Los Angeles was in 1972.</p>
<p>We stayed at a Sheraton hotel somewhere in the San Fernando valley.  Every hotel employee I saw including maids and janitors was White.  Now almost all hotel employees are Hispanic, including management in the very high level hotels in Santa Barbara and La Jolla.</p>
<p>My kids were born in 1967 and 68.  Every hospital employee including maids and food service in that hospital was White.</p>
<p>Now it is unusual to see a White employee in a hospital.  </p>
<p>I insist that all my Drs be White male Americans.  I increasingly resent the fact that their entire office staffs are non White.</p>
<p>I go out of my way to find White American Drs.  I support them but they do not support even 1 White out of maybe 18 office employees..</p>
<p>It is as big a change in 40 years as the change over in Russia in the 1920&rsquo;s and China in 1948. Worse, it was all done by White politicians, business people and activists.</p>
<p>As California goes, so goes the nation.</p>
<p>With these immigration levels, soon California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will have enough electoral votes to elect the Presidents.  The Democrats will have to fund the Republicans to preserve a facade of elections.<br>

<p>john:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you live but what makes you think you will escape California&rsquo;s fate?  The Southern border is still wide open and one million 90% nonwhite legal aliens are allowed to freely enter the US every year.  Add the daisy chain of family reunification and that number triples.</p>
<p>The entire nation is fast filling up with Hispanics, Marxist ideologues and professional moochers.</p>
<p>The United States economy is on life-support.  There will be no &#8220;recovery.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>White americans are too stupid to learn programming, systems design, engineering and even medicine.</i> </p>
<p>You are correct.  </p>
<p>But one thing I cannot figure out for the life of me is why these brilliant, smarter-than-white Asians keep coming over here to steal white-created technology?  Everyone knows whites are too stupid to compete with brilliant Asians in math and science.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t get it.  Jared Taylor must be dead wrong when he wrote in his recent book, White Identity:</p>
<p><i>In 1996, Congress passed a new law making theft of industrial secrets a federal crime. The offense rises to espionage if the secrets are handed over to foreign governments. Every single person arrested or convicted under this law has been Asian, and the vast majority have been Chinese.</i></p>
