<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Norway&rsquo;s capital Oslo has seen a sharp increase in cases of outdoor rape, with the number of attacks in 2011 already double the total for the previous year, according to figures compiled by newspaper Aftenposten.</p>
<p>Police in Oslo registered 24 such cases in 2010 compared to 48 so far this year, Aftenposten said.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians are again raising the alarm and making connections to &#8220;the porno generation&#8221;. An alert has been put out for a &#8220;non-Western-looking&#8221; suspect after the most recent attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can not be denied that many of the culprits have an ethnic background with a critical view of women,&#8221; Conservative party justice critic Andre Oktay Dahl told TV2.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more visible policing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He called for a force of &#8220;volunteer police like has been done in Canada&#8221;. Others have called for the introduction of a specialized vice squad.</p>
<p>One of Saturday night&rsquo;s two assaults happened just metres from the pristine palace residence of Norway&rsquo;s royal family.</p>
<p>TV images of the crime scene of Oslo&rsquo;s 48th sexual assault of the year showed forensic experts in white coveralls working against the backdrop of the Royal Palace.</p>
<p>A 20-year-old woman was attacked by two men after leaving the company of friends to walk home through Slottsparken palace park. One of her two assailants was described as &#8220;dark-skinned and round in the face&#8221;.</p>
<p>The same night a 17-year-old girl victim ran nude into the street in a desperate run from her attacker in an Oslo flat.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know Canada had a volunteer police force.  I&rsquo;m sure that various unions or organizations of existing professional cops would balk at such a proposal.</p>
<p>What nobody in Oslo or in Norway seems to be calling for is to deport these non-whites and not to let any more immigrate.  Norway for Norwegians would go a long way into preventing rapes in Oslo.</p>

		<p>The Oslo police report from May 2011 states that: All assualted rapes committed in the Oslo police district the last five years where the perpetrator is known was a non-Westerner. The news was actually caring as first news on the state broadcoaster NRK that evening. The fact that more than 90 per cent of the victims of these attacks are Nordic looking girls is downplayed. The police chief mentioned in the story Hanne Kristin Rhoede is at least telling the truth, that in contrast to our new deputy major (took office yesterday BTW)Libe Rieber-Mohn(Labour Party) that believes the solution to the problem is more street lights along the infamous Aker River! Welcome to the multicultural city of OSLO. As the most ethnic devided capital in Western Europe where almost all the elitist politicans from all political parties live in a cozy neighborhood in Western Oslo. By the way the Labour Party became the second largest party in the municipal elections in September, 11 out of 20 councillors are non-Westerners. Most of them are Muslims. </p>

		<p>Eventually, if we ever come out of this insanity, White Americans may very well end up fighting in Europe to help Europeans rid the continent of non-Europeans.  I&rsquo;m convinced we are driving ourselves into a world-wide race war, and all for the sake of temporarily telling ourselves we shouldn&rsquo;t be racist.</p>

		<p>I lived for a time in Oslo in 1981. It was absolutely pristine and all White. There were beautiful Norwegian girls everywhere and they were totally SAFE. They were independent and naive in many ways. To move in these Third World types in that environment is insanity. Even more than in the USA. I cannot believe Norwegians would want to change an almost perfect country.Rich from oil, a beautiful country, and a great social system. The politicians there must have their Viking ancestors rolling in their graves.</p>

		<p>That not all people are compatible with each other is such a fundamental principle of human nature the mind reels at why the people who control immigration policy in all Western countries don&rsquo;t get this.</p>
<p>Obviously these non-Whites see no kinship, no relatedness to the White women they&rsquo;re raping. For them they are mere sexual toys to be used and discarded. The physical manifestations of the porn they&rsquo;ve likely been watching.</p>
<p>All third world immigration into the West must be stopped and <br>
reversed. The immigration officials who have made things of this nature possible are treasonous.</p>

		<p>At first when I heard blame going to &#8220;the porno generation&#8221; my eyes rolled and I was about to think what excuse will they come up with next. Then I remembered that I have often wondered about the effect of porn on Muslim men. The 9/11 terrorists went to a strip club before the mission. A stash of porn was found in Osama Bin Laden&rsquo;s home. I suspect porn use is wide-spread among Muslim men and is a cause of much secret shame. Remembered porn images have a way of popping into the mind at the most inconvenient times like when praying. You can never get rid of porn memories. To make the issue worse, the porn industry is mostly white women. As sex objects, Muslim women can&rsquo;t compete. I also suspect that Muslim men are all aware of this problem that they have in common but are afraid to speak about. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think my hypothesis can be dismissed outright but how can it be debated in public as a partial cause of the rape crisis? It would be too embarrassing. </p>

		<p>The women of this land should unite in protest.  One protest that might actually shock the truth of the situation into the government fools who are trying so hard to candy coat this horror would be if ALL of the women took to wearing bright red head to toe burkas.  I KNOW this sounds like capitulation, but a sudden, dramatic transformation like this would make a statement heard around the globe.  Another aspect of this would be for the women to refuse to sleep with their husbands.  Just imagine how fast the reaction would be!<br>

		<p>Any people in a defined territory will invariably create a civilization unique to themselves. Their culture, art, and customs all flow from their racial genetics. If, for example, we visit China we will see the unique Chinese civilization found nowhere else in the world. That civilization is a direct product of the racial characteristics of the Chinese people. If the Chinese people were to vanish from the earth the civilization they created would vanish along with them. The same is true for any particular people occupying a given territory. </p>
<p>Now suppose unfettered third-world immigration was unleashed upon the Chinese such that they were becoming minorities in their own country. The third-world immigrants and the civilizations they created would begin to dominate and eventually displace the unique Chinese people and their civilization.</p>
<p>This is what is going on in the West. The Oslo rapes which are being perpetrated by third-world Muslims on White Norwegian women is merely a consequence of inviting into your territory a  totally foreign people. We may expect things to get much worse throughout the West as a result of inviting into our countries massive numbers of peoples unlike ourselves.</p>

		<p>Yes, the poster who claimed it has nothing to do with being smart. I agree with that. But it does, however, have everything to do with insanity. When you repeat the practices of bringing 3rd world Muslims into Scandinavia, which has historically had one of the highest standards of living on the planet, &amp; think that the new population will act like the host country, that is the insanity. It&rsquo;s never going to happen. </p>
<p>Maybe the left wants to see their homelands collapse, but we don&rsquo;t want to be around for it. White flight was appropriate twenty or thirty years ago, but we are running out of places to go. Why do you think some former ghettoes in American big cities have been gentrified and revamped towards upscale Whites? The key is showing these Whites to be more racially aware. </p>

<p>Interestingly, there aren&rsquo;t any nonwhite countries where mass numbers of nonwhites are being shipped.</p>
<p>This is so obviously a coordinated and planned and purposeful effort. There really should be a rational discussion of who is behind this, and what they have to gain by disrupting white societies.</p>

<p>48 rapes can still be swept under the rug.  Think of the gruesome crimes that are out of sight in this country. In this country mob violence can be swept under the rug.  <br>
How many mainstream whites heard about the little white boy being torched to death  with a welding tool last Christmas?  I have told people and guess what, they do not believe it. If it were true it would be on the news, right? They need to be gang raped to see the light, and sooner than later, they will be obliged. </p>

It is not just Norway, it is everywhere. A few people speak out and are condemned as racists. </p>

<p><i>Opposition politicians are again raising the alarm and making connections to &ldquo;the porno generation&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p><br>
They should instead be raising the alarm and making connections to &ldquo;the uncovered meat phenomenon&rdquo;. This was first discovered by a Muslim imam in Australia a few years back, who was reported preaching that Oz women, by not wearing enough clothes, are provoking Muslim men into raping them. Quoth the imam: &#8220;If you leave out uncovered meat, can you blame the cat for eating it?&#8221; Islam&rsquo;s racist, sexist attitude that Infidel women are all sluts who are asking for it, is a MUCH likelier spur for Oslo&rsquo;s rape epidemic than pornography. </p>

<i>He called for a force of &ldquo;volunteer police like has been done in Canada&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>I live in Canada and have never heard of any such thing. Closest I can think of is the Neighborhood Watch signs I occasionally see around town. (Not that I ever see any Neighborhood Watchers patrolling, I only see the signs.) But of course lots of countries have a Neighborhood Watch program, and none are what could be called a &#8220;volunteer police force.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Norway was not always rich.  (Oslo is currently the most expensive city in the world.) </p>
<p>Traditionally, Scandinavia was one of the poorest parts of Europe. Even Sweden, until the arrival of industrialization a century ago, was very poor. Norway, with a brief and erratic growing season and its  thin soil,  had little to offer but rocks, mountains, fjords, and scenery. It&rsquo;s main industries were fish and lumber. And before the welfare state arrived, there was no attraction there for immigrants.</p>
<p>It was a country that exported population.  One could say the same for Ireland, which was historically an exporter of population to richer places. There was little to be had at home. The only hope was to go abroad. </p>
<p>Now, all of that has changed!  These traditionally poor countries have become wealthy and the immigration is pouring in, overwhelming the natives. </p>
<p>The bottom line seems to be that, ironically, poverty is oddly good for a country&rsquo;s gene pool and national culture, while momentary wealth is lethal to its genetic or cultural survival.  In other words, poverty preserves, while prosperity kills.  Sad but true. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right, and when it has been brought up in the past, it seemed to evoke giggle-like comments from the few who responded.  But the REASON I found Amren originally was because one day, back in the early part of the last decade, I got curious one day.  I very honestly thought that I would surf the web to see how black and whites were getting along online.  All I found was black on white porn sites.  It didn&rsquo;t turn me on, it made me feel sick.  Not only is the porn often brutal, but it is often full of anti-white taunting.  I even have seen some where the white women is pressed to declare the superiority of blacks, etc.  I avoid it because it only makes me feel sick and then angry.  I can&rsquo;t imagine why white women will fall to such low occupation, especially in the post-feminist era.  But I&rsquo;ve even read some women rationalize porn work as a kind of feminist success story!  Of course, I realize that some of these women and many are obviously under 20, are terribly naive and perhaps also trapped in some way.</p>
<p>So discussing this IS something that ought to go on.  I&rsquo;d like to see some comments by women.  I am sure that the remedy is NOT simply harping on Christian values, that goes right through the head of most.  Appeals to personal worth and dignity and anti-gang work is what I think is required.  And action such as some of us going to truck stops and interfering and trying to rescue underage girls from the pimps and johns.  That might be done by citizen groups, and even Christian groups, but we need to do something to impact this besides demanding the police do something. They are either overwhelmed, corrupt, or unable to legally act.</p>
<p>As for this Norwegian report;  Well, the shooter Breivik seems to have reacted (triggered into action) by a rape on the steps of the Parliament across from the palace while security people watched and people passed by smiling at the scene.  Sounds like a mentally ill society, and Brievik felt he was attacking the cause.</p>
<p>This morning I saw a business report where some where saying that the EU&rsquo;s days are numbered.  Disagreement over how to handle the debt problems sovereignty issues seem to be the force at work against the EU, but quietly palpable was a feeling that problems with immigrants was part of it.  Good.<br>
 <br>
I hope the Norwegians and other European nations figure this stuff out.</p>

		<p>These comments are compelling and sensible. I&rsquo;m glad to read them, but I suggest posting them on the original article. They would be much more useful there. Amren readers already know the truth, but most Norwegians do not. Introduce them to race reality, and the concept of capital punishment. Reach out to Scandinavia. There is a &#8220;local&#8221; for both Norway and Sweden. Both online newspapers have English sections. Even if you comment on a Norwegian or Swedish language article, most folks there can read English. It is time for Scandinavia to meet AMREN!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the video and definitely there is a planned agenda.  It&rsquo;s amazing what chutzpah this lady has, the way she talks - it&rsquo;s as if she rules Europe herself.  I can certainly understand why people sometimes resort to violence, although I don&rsquo;t react that way myself.  One thing is certain: if the internet ever falls into the hands of these international oligarchs we are finished.  It&rsquo;s the only free press now.</p>

<p>Hmm. As a Scandinavian I&rsquo;d like to offer a couple of hints.</p>
<p>1) Don&rsquo;t harp on about capital punishment, but criticize the overtly gentle court sentences, or better yet, state that they&rsquo;re ok with first-timers and youth criminals, but completely asinine with repeaters and hardened career criminals. Call for expulsion of foreign criminals, too. Those things have definite support. Capital punishment is generally frowned upon even by those who want far more punitive system, and for many it&rsquo;s a kind of red flag, after which they won&rsquo;t really read more of what you write.</p>
<p>2) If you write on Swedish sites, do have a thick skin. It&rsquo;s the Scandinavian nation most dedicated to immigration and multiculturalism, the most ruthless in suppressing opposition to it, and the most dedicated in Scandinavian vice/virtue of consensus politics, of allowing only one basic truth exist at a time and thinking the only legitimate debate is about its details. Sure, a lot of Swedes are completely fed up with the great social experiment, but most still seem to wear blinkers, and to challenge The Truth can invite an attacks venomous even by American standards. Huntford&rsquo;s &#8220;New Totalitarians&#8221; is worth reading.</p>
<p>But yes, this site is certainly worth reading for Europeans as well. Our problems are the two faces of the same coin, and it is enlightening to study the other face, which is of course why AmRen has ran so many articles on Europe. By the way - if December 2006 article on my Finland seemed depressing, it may be comforting to learn that it was written while counterreaction had already gathered force for some time and was pretty much ready to burst. Things are far better now. There is still so much to do, but we have the initiative and most of all we&rsquo;ve caught this virus while it&rsquo;s still mostly in incubation stage. Since Scandinavia seems to be something of a darling of US left, another Nordic country going the way of Denmark may even be a blow for it.</p>

<p>Netzach, I have read here and there that the Swedes secretly made a deal with the communist Russians in the early part of the 20th century. The Swedes would create a perfect almost communist society as a communist examplar to the rest of the world and the Russians would never attack Sweden.</p>
<p>Certainly the European and American communists praised Sweden to the skies.  The idea was that maybe Stalin made a few mistakes killing innocents along with the subservive elements but if the rest of the world followed Sweden we would all live in a communist paradise.</p>
<p>I know Finland was almost a Swedish economic colony for centuries and that Russia has historic claims to Finland. Gunnar Mrydahl was a member of the Swedish communist party.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on this Netzach?</p>

<p>Thanks for your advice. I for one will try to adhere by your suggestions. I can&rsquo;t believe that Scandinavians are so adamantly against capital punishment. In the US, almost 80% of the white population favor capital punishment. Significant numbers of minorities favor it as well.  I wonder what the reason is for such a significant deviation. I believe that Americans have endured violent crime for a longer period of time. Also, it seems that Northern Europeans hysterically avoid anything that is even remotely similar to the Nazi regime&hellip;even if that means allowing several hundred thousand Europeans to be victims of rape and murder at the hands of foreigners. </p>
<p>When I see prison reality shows on television, I can&rsquo;t understand why are we allowing these people to live. They are only capable of horrific violent crimes and destruction. They commit crimes within prison walls, and commit them again when released. I never want to seem like a radical and I don&rsquo;t enjoy killing&hellip;but we have to get rid of these people if we want to save our civilization. </p>
<p>Near the end of the dark ages, the pope in Rome had all of the city&rsquo;s criminals executed/killed. When the city became safe to live and prosper, he had Rome&rsquo;s aqueducts and sewers repaired. He restored some of the old buildings and built some beautiful new ones. Commerce, education, and culture prospered in Rome, and spread throughout Europe. The mass execution criminals started the Renaissance, which brought us into the modern age. Without this action, the dark ages would have likely become worse and never ended. I dislike the idea of killing, but either we take over and survive or the criminals take over. I choose us over the criminals. Civilization is decaying so rapidly that we now must make this unfortunate choice. There is no more time to philosophize. </p>
<p>Our justice system in the U.S. can be harsher than Europe, although it is still ridiculously lenient. Please tell the folks of Scandinavia that lenient sentences and free council flats will not stop interracial rape and murder.  This spineless leniency actually accelerates crime. Once again, Netzach, thank you for your opinion. Please continue to post. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just Scandinavians.  All of modern Europe is opposed to capital punishment. <br>
Of course, it is understood that this applies to their own people, hence the concern.    In the USA, the criminals and miscreants  are generally of another race, hence less sympathy for them here. . </p>
<p><i>In the US, almost 80% of the white population favor capital punishment.   I wonder what the reason is for such a significant deviation?&hellip; It seems that Northern Europeans hysterically avoid anything that is even remotely similar to the Nazi regime..&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Well, there you said it. You just answered your own question.<br>
Virtually all of modern European politics are the result of 1945 and a reaction to WW2. </p>

		<p>Sorry for missing your answers, anons. With the discussions spread over 10+ threads daily, it&rsquo;s easy to forget checking some you&rsquo;ve written in for answers.</p>
<p>anon1,</p>
<p>Finland was an integral part of Swedish Kingdom from 13th century forwards, certainly exploited in favour of centre, but probably not worse than the Kingdom&rsquo;s other backwaters. During Napoleonic Wars, Russia conquered Finland and granted it wide-ranging internal autonomy. Neither power really holds any claim to Finland these days, Sweden having relinquished them long ago and Soviet Union having found out the hard way that attempts of conquest are both risky and cost way too much considering any potential gains.</p>
<p>Anyway, I doubt Sweden made any such deals with Soviet Union. They had Finland as a buffer zone and besides, the &#8220;perfect socialist society&#8221; with far different system from USSR was probably more of an embarrassment than anything. Not to mention danger, as having a working example of other kind of socialist state just worsened the alienation of many Western Communists from USSR, and it may have inspired dissension inside the Soviet Bloc (google Prague Spring for example). I think there were at least two important reasons for Swedish model.</p>
<p>1) If I remember correctly, it was that Myrdal who posited that if socialism is going to work anywhere, the place is Sweden. Strong communal and egalitarian traditions, strong group identity, high levels of interpersonal trust, relatively low income differences and remarkably efficient, uncorrupted civil service with an ethos for actually serving the public. And sure, it did work fairly well&hellip; until they began importing completely different people.</p>
<p>2) This is just a theory, but I suspect that Sweden tried to angle for power and prestige amongst non-aligned nations by its immigration policy. Recall that during 60s and 70s a lot of people actually thought that the Third World, even Africa, was going to rise rapidly after the yoke of colonialism was lifted. By opening its borders to non-Western immigration, Sweden was going to increase its population and create connections to their countries of origin. And of course the enlightened Sweden was going to do so much better with integrating the newcomers than the brutish America, which would demonstrate the superiority of its social model to all, especially to those formerly poor 3rd World nations it was courting.</p>
<p>By the time it was pretty clear it wasn&rsquo;t working, they had already decided that this was The Way and proper Swedes weren&rsquo;t supposed to dissent. By the time it was blindingly obvious that a dreadful mistake had been made, it was already too late to go back. A lot of them are afraid of admitting this and others fight back furiously because it&rsquo;s just not right to dissent about something so fundamentally about Who You Are. Kinda like Americans and the question of &#8220;hey, what if the blacks really are genetically less intelligent or their problems are due to some deep enough cultural trait that outside intervention just doesn&rsquo;t do any good, and we&rsquo;ve been doing the wrong thing all these decades?&#8221;. Except probably worse, because these are Swedes.</p>
<p>anon2,</p>
<p>Anyway, a lot of it is indeed counter-reaction against Nazis, but also a way for former Great Powers to psychologically cope with becoming little but subordinate allies for superpowers. If Western European countries could do something differently from USA and tell themselves it&rsquo;s better, they could at least consider themselves superior in some way. This has had a lot of implications, but it certainly shows in the area judicial policy and how it is regarded. Something like US use of death sentences, with occasional innocents getting executed and the absurdly long, repetitive rounds of appeals at ridiculous expense is, I&rsquo;m afraid, easy to sneer at. There are other valid grounds of criticizing the American way as well.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s always easier to see the flaws of others than those of your own. If I told you some stories about Finnish judicial system - even fairly typical ones - you probably wouldn&rsquo;t even be outraged, because you&rsquo;d have too hard time believing it. I, on the other hand, have no trouble feeling angry and bitter, so I spare myself those anecdotes. Overt strictness and leniency are both dangerous, but especially in the current situation, the latter is far worse. For one thing, one central function of courts is to punish offenders, so the citizens won&rsquo;t have to do it. If they don&rsquo;t do that in a way considered legitimate, sooner or later the lynch law comes back. It&rsquo;s still pretty rare for ordinary citizens to do anything, though there was a noteworthy case a while back, with a certain infamous paedophile murderer of two girls released from the asylum for criminally insane, and promptly getting beaten up viciously enough to almost kill him. He&rsquo;ll spend the rest of his life drooling in a wheelchair. While I don&rsquo;t feel a shred of empathy for that man, I dislike vigilantism. He should have been executed or kept locked up for the rest of his life. I don&rsquo;t think the culprits were ever found and I kind of doubt the police made a real effort, either.</p>
<p>For another, the system may restrain those who have strong internal controls against crime, but a lot of minorities simply don&rsquo;t have those. Quite a few of them have said this openly, like the former leader of Finnish Somali Alliance. &#8220;It&rsquo;s sometimes difficult for us to understand the overtly gentle Nordic court system. Our young men are used to strict discipline, and when they enter an environment where actions have no real consequences, they often think they can do whatever they like.&#8221; Well, expulsion back to Somalia, Iraq or whatever Camelstan they came from does have a real deterrent effect, but unsurprisingly the procedure is a convoluted mess which can and has been disputed up to the Supreme Court. Streamlining this, and making it automatic for repeated and serious crimes is of great importance, just like significant increase of sentences for non-expulsable citizens guilty of such. Wasting time and money in trying to reform hardened career criminals and psychopaths is criminally irresponsible and naive.</p>
