			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, October 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Increased immigration from South Asia helped fuel the rapid growth in the number of Asian Americans over the last decade as well as an influx of Asians to states such as Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data released Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Looking at Asian Americans as a single group masks the distinct social and economic needs of the various ethnicities involved, said Dan Ichinose, director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Center&rsquo;s Demographic Research Project. {snip}</p>
<p>And while 26% of Hmong Americans and 20% of Bangladeshi Americans live below the poverty line, only 6% of Filipinos and 8% of Indians do.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the report, which used 2010 Census, American Community Survey and other government data, immigration, both legal and illegal, has fueled most of the population growth. Approximately 60% of Asian Americans are foreign-born and about 1 million are undocumented, according to the report.</p>
<p>Among the undocumented, those from the Philippines, India, South Korea and China make up the largest numbers.</p>
<p>Though California&rsquo;s population of more than 5.5 million Asian Americans remained the country&rsquo;s largest, several other states showed significant growth over the last decade. The population of Asian Americans in Nevada more than doubled, while in Arizona it almost doubled.</p>

		<p>As Asians proliferate, we&rsquo;re going to see more conflict between them and whites.  Already, Asians have pushed whites out of certain industries like IT and many types of small businesses.  </p>
<p>Asians have moved to the left politically over the last 20 years and are now voting strongly Democratic.  The newer generation of Asian immigrants and their US born children often have hostile attitudes towards white and more attachment to their country of origin that older generations of Asian Americans.  Older whites who have not worked and went to school with recent Asian immigrants are largely unaware of how anti-white many of them are.  </p>

		<p>The Hmong, hill tribesmen from Southeast Asia (Montagnards) could have a rough time adapting.</p>
<p>Other East Asians, however, seem to go through the same adaptive process that Irish, Italians, and Poles went through early in the 20th Century.  The parents normally gathered in ethnically familiar neighborhoods, where their native languages were spoken.

		<p>If the pattern in the US is anything like that in Australia where 10% of the population is Asian the intake from high I.Q. areas such as Hong Kong will fall in proportion to lower I.Q. areas like India and Sri Lanka. The low percentage of Indians below the poverty line in the U.S. would reflect that they are better qualified than others like Hmong and Bangladeshis.</p>

		<p>One of the largest impacts of Asian (East and South East Asian) immigration is the white man/Asian woman mixing.  It appears that white men prefer Asian women for various reasons.  If there&rsquo;s a large number of Asians in an area, you&rsquo;ll see many of the men, often the ones who are more educated, paired up with an Asian woman.  At my place of employment, one of the top 3 internet companies in the world, out of the white men on my team 80% are in relationships with or married to Asian women.  These are highly educated men in the field of engineering.  </p>
<p>I was just at the super market, of the couples I saw, it was old white couples, younger white men with Asian women, and a young white girl with a black 20 something year old man.</p>
<p>White women are mixing with blacks and Hispanics.  The upper end of white men are mixing with Asian women.  Even tight-knit white groups like Jews are mixing with Asian women.  Example, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who only dates Asian women.</p>

		<p>And just exactly what <i>is</i> an &#8220;Asian?&#8221;  Asia is a big continent, and it contains many widely different racial groups.  Are we talking about Chinese?  Pakistanis?  Hmong?  Indians?  Japanese?  Mongolians?</p>
<p>There is no such race as &#8220;Asian,&#8221; and race realists of all people, ought to know it.  &#8220;Asian&#8221; is a term invented by our enemies for the sole purpose of blurring racial boundaries.</p>

<p>Oh, no kidding, Dan?  Then how about we start calling these &#8220;various ethnicities&#8221; what they are, instead of pretending there is some amorphous, racially-ambiguous human blob called &#8220;Asians.&#8221;<br>

<p>This is correct. The same is also true of South Asians. A good example is Nikki Haley (Governor of South Carolina) who within a single generation has become indistinguishable from the population at large.</p>
<p>Also, Asian-white marriages are statistically more frequent than black-white marriages, and the children of Asian-white marriages have higher average IQ than white children and tend to identify culturally with the white side. Those of us with Asian spouses probably know what I am talking about. I expect marriage to Asians will, over time, become as accepted within race-realist circles as marriage to Italians or Poles.</p>

		<p>Bare in mind that human beings adapt to circumstances. A hundred years ago, America was a strong, attractive nation. Immigrants wanted to be part of it. Today&rsquo;s America is not a country any normal immigrant would want to become part of. Rather, a normal immigrant views America as a vast resource to be colonized and exploited.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a disgrace that these &#8220;undocumented&#8221; workers are allowed to remain in the United States no matter what their country of origin. I&rsquo;ve always thought that if immigrants will break the law to get to the United States, what other laws will they break after arriving here? It clearly shows their contempt for our laws and traditions. So called &#8220;model minorities&#8221; obey our laws.</p>

<p>Blacks and American Indians. &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; without too much native blood do fine.</p>
<p>The Irish took a *lot* longer to reasonable assimilate than people think. Even 4+ generations in, they voted for fools like Kennedy and Johnson. A lot of them are still clueless and unfamiliar with the philosophies that built America. Catholic and Jews are more similar than either wants to admit.</p>

		<p>What is it with all these rationalizations about Asians here? They are still NOT US! They don&rsquo;t want to be like us and we shouldn&rsquo;t want them to be like us. They want to REPLACE US! And some of you don&rsquo;t mind that as long as it isn&rsquo;t blacks and hispanics? If you are White and think this way then you have entirely missed the point of this website.</p>
<p>Anyone who thinks Asians are our friends obviously have not seen them when they have an absolute majority in a place. I have seen what they do when they take over a neighborhood. They suddenly no longer feel the need to play nice. Ever see what a Sikh or a Hindu acts like when your the only white person around? Ever see what they do to a neighborhood? Do us a favor and go over and look before citing statistics about interracial marriages and IQ, or bringing up Haley Barbour or Bobby Jindal. The same surely goes for Southeast Asians or any other group that seek to colonize any White country.</p>
<p>Our countries became great because White people made them that way, without interference from non-whites. Even and maybe especially on the town or neighborhood level we have created for ourselves the kind of space that reflects us. Anyone old enough to have grown up in all White places know this. No outside group wants to maintain things that way, no matter how equal in ability (and no, in the aggregate most of them are not). So what you get will always be alien. Enough with the Asian love. If they&rsquo;re so great then let them all go back home and make their own countries better.</p>

		<p>Wow, so it is okay to insult the Irish here? Three generations ago my great grandfather came to this country and not to exploit it, he came here to work hard and to change his families lives for the better. There was no assimilation period. I resent the last comment and almost feel as if you are placing those with Irish ancestry in the same group with nonwhite immigrants. Itallians and the jewish also had their criminal elements, as did nearly every other group.</p>

		<p>White Nationalists and Race Realists have a lot in common but are not the same political movement.</p>
<p>Both are pro-White and pro-Western (or Eastern for Asian race realists in Asia ) and accept human biodiversity. However RR folks are a lot more inclusive of other non White races and I&rsquo;d say suggest a more inclusive policy that would not appeal to the WN crowd.</p>
<p>This should not stop the two sides from working together on common ground at all. They need each other and are not natural enemies. I dare say if the RR people won out, the WN people could be decently happy in the America they want, a smart, high trust America and maybe, though to a lesser degree the reverse. </p>

<p>Yes, WNs need RRs. But how on earth do RRs need WNs? I believe that WNs have in fact been overall detrimental to RR, since they can have just as much trouble as blank-slaters in dealing with data and evidence realistically when they don&rsquo;t like the conclusions. Outsiders who don&rsquo;t know the difference then assume that this is the case for all RRs (which it is not), or that RR is just a cover for WN (which it was not meant to be). Serious RRs then have to waste our time PROVING we are not WNs instead of moving ahead with the discussion.</p>

		<p>The posters who claim the current and future Asian immigrants will eventually assimilate similar to the earlier European immigrants are mistaken for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) Assimilation works when the ratio of those being assimilated is small in relation to the majority population.  Given the massive population bases of just two Asian nations, India 1.2 billion, and China 1.3 billion, coupled with the United States liberal immigration policies either of these two nations could overwhelm the United States and we would be the ones being assimilated.  </p>
<p>2)  The earlier European immigrants had differences, but consider the borders of Europe were fluid for thousands of years so there was still strong commonality between some nations.  For example, compare the cities of Stockholm and Venice.  They are separated by a considerable distance, but a high Western culture is evident in both cities.</p>
<p>3) Asian values, ethics, etc, are vastly different than those found in the West.  Cheating is the national pastime in China and most of Asia.  The people who believe that Western values are imbued on anyone who crosses the border are fools, especially if they come in significant numbers.<br>

		<p>Well, I can think of a couple of places where whites and East Asians seem to get along pretty well - Singapore and Hong Kong. Throw in our own islands of Hawaii while we&rsquo;re having the discussion.</p>
<p>People of similar intelligence always have a reasonable chance of living with one another peaceably and agreeably. </p>
<p>People of markedly dissimilar intellectual levels will automatically segregate into groups, and mutually hostile ones at that.</p>

		<p>I am noticing more and more that the white men in this movement who enjoy talking about the merits of marrying Asian women and the supposed negative qualities of most white women, are trying to justify the reason that they themselves chose to marry an  Asian woman, and why they weren&rsquo;t able to find a decent white woman.  The fact of the matter is that statistically speaking, most white men don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with white women, as the people who misceginate are few in number. Plus, I hate to use this as an example, as I despise the porn industry, but considering that most women in girly magazines in this country  are blonde or brunette white women, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to me that white men overwhelmingly find Asian women more attractive when going by looks, just to give one of many examples.</p>
<p>Second of all, people on here need to learn to think outside the box on this race realism and IQ issue. I take offense to this idea that someone such as myself who states facts on how whites have created superior civilizations to everyone else, including Asians, is automatically a &#8220;white supremacist&#8221;.  People who come on here and constantly talk about how Asians are &#8220;better than whites&#8221; are supporting some agenda instead of actually looking at facts. And they try to cover up their lack of facts by labeling those of us who are justifiably proud of our white civilization as &#8220;white supremacists&#8221;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to exclude people from the movement, but it should be obvious to anyone that the above two agendas I discuss are detrimental for our cause.</p>

<p>Please read Oberweis&rsquo; comment again. He wasn&rsquo;t saying that most white men prefer Asian women, rather he was saying that the better white men prefer Asian women, in his words: &#8220;The upper end of white men are mixing with Asian women&#8221;. Since most white men are not upper end, there is no contradiction with your claim. Also he never passed judgment on this; he was simply stating what he had observed.</p>
<p>Studies on assortative matching have consistently shown that married couples tend to have roughly similar IQs. Therefore it should be no surprise that upper end white men are more likely to marry Asian women. (In the same way, when black women marry white men, they tend to be the upper end black women.)</p>

		<p>WN and RR need to spend less time arguing among themselves, and more time increasing their earning capacity and their investing acumen so that they can donate more to political causes such as border control, deportation of illegals, English only, reduce &#8220;entitlements&#8221; and lower taxes and support suitable political candidates. Money will also allow them to live in low crime areas and to home school their own kids, thus protecting their children from known threats.</p>
<p>Courtney from AL: Living in CA&rsquo;s ethnically diverse SF Bay Area, I notice that usually the most aggressive and self-centered drivers on the roads are white women. They are even worse than black men who, because they&rsquo;re guys, know that when they act like jerks, there&rsquo;s a risk of physical confrontation. These white women think they can act like it w/o any consequences. </p>
<p>When I was a kid in the &rsquo;60s, white moms were the most polite, considerate, and careful drivers around. They cared about protecting life, esp children. Not anymore. They&rsquo;re racing in their SUVs to get from work to pick up their kids and take drop them off at soccer practice while they&rsquo;re at their yoga class. All the while they&rsquo;re gabbing on their cell phones&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The reason why there are so many illegal immigrants from the Philippines, China and South Korea is that the waiting period for those who want to legally immigrate from these countries can take years or even decades. I looked at the immigration  bulletin and they were processing family applications from 1988! The only countries that have a long waiting period is Canada and Mexico.</p>

<p>Maybe it is true that upper end white males are more likely to end up with Asian women than lower end white males, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me like this is a trend among MOST upper end white men.  I have known many very successful and smart white men and most of them seem to prefer attractive white women. It is rare that I see a white man with an Asian woman unless he has some sort of a short coming. And as you threw at me : &#8220;this is just my observation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Also, it is understood that it takes a higher IQ to move up and become famous in just about any field.  You have to know what you are doing.  The funny thing is, is that I am thinking about every single famous and successful white man I can think of, and the only one I can remember who hooked up with an Asian woman was John Lennon.  Most famous, successful, smart, attractive white men prefer attractive white women it seems, yet posters such as yourself make it sound as if white women are losing out to Asian women in this regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in CA&rsquo;s ethnically diverse SF Bay Area, I notice that usually the most aggressive and self-centered drivers on the roads are white women. They are even worse than black men who, because they&rsquo;re guys, know that when they act like jerks, there&rsquo;s a risk of physical confrontation. These white women think they can act like it w/o any consequences. &#8220;</p>
<p>Another knee jerk attempt to bring up something negative about white women for no reason at all. And what does this have to do with anything? The worst drivers I have had experiences with have been nonwhite drivers including Asians. And since you prefer to be divisive on here, aren&rsquo;t there plenty of negative qualities we could pick on white men for as well?</p>

<p>Yes, thanks for proving my point by mentioning a white man I don&rsquo;t care for who tries to justify his shortcomings in finding a decent white woman and instead marrying a Mexican. I read his piece there and of course there is no sort of biasness involved.  I don&rsquo;t think he should have been invited to speak at an AR conference quite frankly. It is funny that the men on here get upset that there aren&rsquo;t more white women involved in the movement but what do they expect? If this is going to be the atmosphere at American Renaissance conferences (inviting speakers like this) then I guess that they are more interested in keeping it as a white man&rsquo;s club, in which white men can discuss how unappealing white women are and show off their trophy Asian and hispanic wives to each other.</p>

<p>Thank you, Courtney. I feel the same way about &#8220;Fred&#8221;. It seems to me that the Amren Conference is slowly injecting race mixers and others (I don&rsquo;t feel are really with us)as speakers for our cause. Are they starting to pander?  I hope not.</p>

		<p>So now we are to split off into White Nationalism and &#8216;Race Realism&rsquo;? What is Race Realism, anyway? Honestly, it sounds like appeasement to me. Citing dubious statistics, highlighting model minorities, spewing tortuous logic and displaying smug superiority sounds all like what the multiculturalists do. </p>
<p>So do RRs think they are going to trick ever-increasing numbers of Asians into assimilating towards us and at the same time convince us that it is somehow OK or even wonderful that this supposed assimilation is taking place? Or what is the explicit goal of Race Realism, after all?</p>
<p>My take is that it sounds like surrender. &#8220;Oh oh, here comes the Asians! Let&rsquo;s all believe the propaganda that they are the unstoppable future and there is no way we can compete with India and China. So let&rsquo;s all hide behind them so they&rsquo;ll protect us against the mean blacks and hispanics&#8221;. Or maybe &#8220;My Asian wife will be mad at me and won&rsquo;t (blank) if I take too hard a pro-white stand&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s is nothing realistic about your philosophy. You will not get the results you desire. You will only find yourself serving a new master. All you have to do is look at the actions of the Chinese government or the aggressive crony business practices of the Indians here in the U.S. to know that. Whites will not be co-rulers. Ask the Tibetans if they are having a Tibetan Nationalist versus Race Realist argument there.</p>
<p>Once again. White is White. Wholly European and nothing else is what made us who we are. History shows again and again that societies are strong where one ethnicity dominates and knows it. Just like they say, integration in a neighborhood is what happens between when the first black moves in and the last white moves out. No different for cultures. Did you see the opening ceremonies to the Beijing Olympics? Chinese cultural triumphalism front and center. Now wait until next year&rsquo;s London ceremonies, where I read they have planned some pathetic multicult spectacle, all while their own police run from black rioters. </p>
<p>And you guys think you are being realistic.</p>

<p>Re. &#8220;average&#8221; white guys &amp; Asian gals: I remember first reading about the disproportionate number of those relationships in the SF Bay Area back in the early &rsquo;90s. It was mostly involving UCB, USCSF, and Stanford students/grads. In 2005, Wong Fu Productions released their &#8220;Yellow Fever&#8221; short film (filmed in SoCal at UCSD):<br>

<p>My comment re white women&rsquo;s driving illustrates how much white women in America (in general, not necessarily any white woman in particular), have changed their values &amp; behaviors over the past 40 years. That change in attitude and behavior is not limited to their driving. Asian girls are #11 at stuffwhitepeoplelike.com because &#8220;Asian women avoid key white women characteristics, such as having a midlife crisis, divorce, and hobbies that don&rsquo;t involve taking care of the children.&#8221; Asian who are bad drivers are usually clueless as to what they are doing wrong, whereas these white women drivers know exactly what they are doing.</p>
<p>Another observation of mine re. drivers: Asians &amp; Caucasians almost always nod, wave, or give another expression of &#8220;thanks&#8221; when you let them cut in or yield to them in some way. Latinos do such about 1/2 the time. Blacks virtually NEVER express thanks. This holds true regardless of gender. Again, just my experience in the SF Bay Area.</p>
<p>While I am sure that white men have many short comings, many Asian women seem to be able to complement   &mdash;   not to be confused w/compliment   &mdash;   them, and vice versa. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why, where there are many Asian women in America, there are many WMAF couples. Hopefully, RR Asian guys will connect w/RR white gals just as well. </p>

<p>So in order to prove this to me you obviously had to search the internet for a website that talks about &#8216;Asian trophy wives&rsquo;, which of course is not biased. But the main point here is that you had to do a search at all.  Is anybody on here, OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS, really able to think of any famous white man who married an Asian woman other than Lennon?  Nope, didn&rsquo;t think so. In fact, I talked with a guy friend on the phone last night about this discussion, and he himself couldn&rsquo;t think of anyone else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asian girls are #11 at stuffwhitepeoplelike.com because &#8216;Asian women avoid key white women characteristics, such as having a midlife crisis, divorce, and hobbies that don&rsquo;t involve taking care of the children.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
<p>Oh and now you are presenting me with a blog on the internet written by a nerdy liberal white kid in his twenties.  That is real scholarly.  Since HE puts Asian women at number 11 on his list then I guess every other white should too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asian who are bad drivers are usually clueless as to what they are doing wrong, whereas these white women drivers know exactly what they are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm, be careful how you go about making statements like this. So are you saying whites need to be held to a higher standard? If so, why? Why wouldn&rsquo;t Asians &#8216;know what they are doing&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Another observation of mine re. drivers: Asians &amp; Caucasians almost always nod, wave, or give another expression of &#8216;thanks&rsquo; when you let them cut in or yield to them in some way&hellip;&hellip;This holds true regardless of gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought you just got done telling me about how the women folk of the Caucasian race are horrible drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;While I am sure that white men have many short comings, many Asian women seem to be able to complement  &mdash;  not to be confused w/compliment  &mdash;  them, and vice versa.

<p>That is a nice little plan you have there but unfortunately 90% of Asian women, Asian men, white women, and white men will refuse to go along with it.  You can&rsquo;t fight nature here.  Nobody is as good for an Asian woman as an Asian man is, and nobody is as good for a white man as a white woman is.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What is Race Realism, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Race Realism is simply this: looking at human biodiversity so as to reach unbiased conclusions, rather than to promote information that makes one&rsquo;s politics look good and bash information that makes one&rsquo;s politics look bad. Neither blank-slaters nor WN are RRs because both start with a dogma. Blank-slaters start with the dogma that everyone is entirely interchangeable with everyone else. WNs start with the dogma that only whites are good for America. It is obvious that both dogmas are wrong. The real data shows that some groups assimilate easily and others do not, but - sadly - it takes an RR to see this and be unafraid to accept it.</p>
<p>RRs bring up quantitative facts about Asian educational attainment, income, low welfare dependence, low crime rates, low STD rates, etc.. WNs respond with ad hominem caricatures of RRs about &#8220;Asian trophy wives&#8221; and other nonsense from their own imaginations. Courtney claimed that only white men with &#8220;shortcomings&#8221; marry Asian women. Funnily enough, bitter black women claim exactly the same thing about black men who marry white women. Make of it what you will, but I see a pattern here.</p>

<p>This is starting to get ridiculous.  What is your goal here?  If you want Asians and whites to coexist and form their own empire, then there are plenty of websites you can go to for that.  Why are you trying to take over things on here?</p>
<p>Here are some facts I&rsquo;d like to throw right back at you since you claim I don&rsquo;t use any. </p>
<p>1)Asians have their own countries to live in/ whites do not. Isn&rsquo;t it part of basic human God given rights and liberties for people of a particular race to be able to have their own lands to live in to practice their own cultures?</p>
<p>2)It has never been proven that we need Asians here.  In fact I can prove just the opposite. During America&rsquo;s greatest decades for technological growth, this country was just about void of Asians.  Did we need them here to put a man on the moon? To look even more broadly, the white race as a whole did fine for centuries without Asian help. Now in response you are going to talk about gun powder and other Chinese &#8220;inventions&#8221; that have dubious origins and that pale in comparison to everything whites have given the world.</p>
<p>It appears YOU are the one with an agenda based on emotions. </p>
<p>As for your indirect jab at me in your last couple of sentences,&hellip;.. for starters, I have never felt threatened by an Asian woman. I have never had a white man leave me for one. In fact, there are quite a few men involved with this movement who have met me in person. Maybe you should ask them what I look like before you continue with what you are trying to say here. I am also quite young still. In fact most people on here are quite surprised to find out I&rsquo;m not 30 yet.</p>
<p>So that negates your assumption that I am &#8220;bitter&#8221;.  And this &#8220;pattern&#8221; that you are trying to conjure up here doesn&rsquo;t even stick well to begin with in how you are trying to use the bitter black woman analogy when speaking of white women. The worst specimens of every race are the ones who marry outside of it. If the people who choose to marry out of their race are some how the cream of the crop of their race, then wouldn&rsquo;t more people in each race be doing it? I mean you seem to like to talk about race mixing as if it is perfectly normal human behavior. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, WNs need RRs. But how on earth do RRs need WNs? I believe that WNs have in fact been overall detrimental to RR, since they can have just as much trouble as blank-slaters in dealing with data and evidence realistically when they don&rsquo;t like the conclusions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, all twenty of you can go it alone, single-handedly cracking every stone-faced Chinese into smiling acceptance of a round-eye marrying their daughter. You guys are keeping&rsquo; it real!</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;but - sadly - it takes an RR to see this and be unafraid to accept it. RRs bring up quantitative facts about Asian educational attainment, income, low welfare dependence, low crime rates, low STD rates, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Proof that you are just like the lefties and multicults. They also all prattle on about having the &#8216;courage&rsquo; to embrace the new, all the while living in white neighborhoods. Unalloyed and delusional smugness. I bet you all hang on Jim Rogers&rsquo; every word, as he sits in Singapore bad-mouthing his own country and whispering who knows what advice into his Chinese masters&rsquo; ears.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t care about your statistics. I&rsquo;m sure neither do the Asians, who probably see you for the suckers or turncoats that you are. We care about US. As Courtney said, we never needed any Asians around to produce the most astounding results, FOR CENTURIES!</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve explained to me what RR is it only confirms my suspicion that your philosophy is an artificial contraption twisted around clumsily to justify your emotional aversion to your own kind and your sexual attraction to your Asian trophy wives. You probably couldn&rsquo;t handle a real White woman. If that sounds like ad hominem, it is. You don&rsquo;t rate any more than that.<br>
The stakes are too high for us to be entertaining this nonsense at all.</p>

<p>To follow the Jefferson quote that defines AmRen: &#8220;There is not a truth existing which I fear or would wish unknown to the whole world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;Asians have their own countries to live in/ whites do not.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the countries in Eastern Europe?</p>
<p>&gt;Did we need them here to put a man on the moon?</p>
<p>That is a logic fallacy and you should know it. If you want to claim that Asians are bad for America, you would have to prove that having Asians in the country would have somehow PREVENTED us from putting a man on the moon. I doubt even you believe that.</p>
<p>Besides, your argument that America doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;need&#8221; Asians could similarly be applied to say that America doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;need&#8221; Poles or Italians or Irish either. So why apply your argument to some groups but not to others? All I am saying is that if we can welcome Poles and Italians and Irish, and if Asians have demonstrably better track records of socioeconomic success than these groups (which they do), then we should welcome Asians also.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, there are quite a few men involved with this movement who have met me in person. Maybe you should ask them what I look like before you continue with what you are trying to say here.&#8221;</p>
<p>What you are providing is an anecdote, not a fact. Facts are quantifiable and measurable. Regarding physical attractiveness, the facts are that on average, Asian women have lower testosterone levels, less body hair, fewer sweat glands (hence less body odors), more uniform distribution of fat (hence smoother skin), more gracile skeletal structure and more neotenous facial features than white women. All these mean that Asian women will tend to be perceived by men (of any race) as more attractive. They also age much more slowly.</p>
<p>&gt;The worst specimens of every race are the ones who marry outside of it.</p>
<p>But you previously conceded that it is the upper end white men who are more likely to marry Asian women. So are you saying that upper end white men are the worst specimens of white men?</p>
<p>&gt;If the people who choose to marry out of their race are some how the cream of the crop of their race, then wouldn&rsquo;t more people in each race be doing it?</p>
<p>Because the cream of the crop, by definition, is a small minority. </p>

 What they are doing is natural,exporting excess population, taking over and in the process assimilating others. Don&rsquo;t blame them, blame whites who were/are in charge and allow this to happen.</p>

<p>Wow, now I know everything I need to know about you. You are perfectly fine with whites getting displaced in their own countries. You are bargaining here by telling whites they can have SOME of their countries to themselves. Meanwhile, Asians get ALL of their countries. Okay, carry on&hellip;.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a logic fallacy and you should know it. If you want to claim that Asians are bad for America, you would have to prove that having Asians in the country would have somehow PREVENTED us from putting a man on the moon. I doubt even you believe that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wait a minute, I guess history and facts are getting thrown out the window now, huh?  You are basing your argument on a hypothesis.  I am basing mine on history. Isn&rsquo;t that what Race Realism is all about&hellip;.comparing civilizations to each other throughout history?  Whites have outmatched everyone else in achievements and discoveries by a long shot, so your argument that &#8216;we just don&rsquo;t know for sure if we didn&rsquo;t need Asians&rsquo; is quite silly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, your argument that America doesn&rsquo;t &#8216;need&rsquo; Asians could similarly be applied to say that America doesn&rsquo;t &#8216;need&rsquo; Poles or Italians or Irish either. So why apply your argument to some groups but not to others? All I am saying is that if we can welcome Poles and Italians and Irish, and if Asians have demonstrably better track records of socioeconomic success than these groups (which they do), then we should welcome Asians also.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t we compare Nobel Prize winners from each of those nationalities to those of Asians overall?  How about great scientific thinkers and discoverers?  Are you up for the challenge?  And all this aside, Poles, Italians, and Irish people have done a great deal more in creating this country and you know it. I am really starting to lose respect for you. I think you are exposing yourself here in regards to what you are really about, and it doesn&rsquo;t fall in line with what Jared Taylor stands for, by the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding physical attractiveness, the facts are that on average, Asian women have lower testosterone levels, less body hair, fewer sweat glands (hence less body odors), more uniform distribution of fat (hence smoother skin), more gracile skeletal structure and more neotenous facial features than white women. All these mean that Asian women will tend to be perceived by men (of any race) as more attractive. They also age much more slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your &#8216;facts&rsquo; sure are subjective.  Who says most men in the world find what you just described attractive?  Most men on Amren describe Asian women as flat (as opposed to curvy) and prepubescent in appearance. Is that really feminine to you?  I see a lot of Asian women trying to look like white women, but not the other way around.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you previously conceded that it is the upper end white men who are more likely to marry Asian women. So are you saying that upper end white men are the worst specimens of white men?&#8221;</p>
<p>What I am saying OBVIOUSLY is that a high IQ and only a high IQ doesn&rsquo;t define someone as the best of their race.  It is very rare that I see all around attractive, smart, and rich white guys with Asian girls. Most white guys I see with Asian girls are short and nerdy, and they may be smart, but they are lacking in other ways.  The alpha males, and the all around attractive and talented guys seem to prefer attractive white women.  The white men who appear normal don&rsquo;t date Asian women.</p>

<p>There are NO WHITE females having plastic surgery to make themselves look more Asian.  Yet Asian females are obsessed with plastic surgery to make themselves look more like White females.  </p>
<p>It seems a people who have nothing but poker-straight black hair and dark brown eyes envy Whites with our blue, green, hazel, and light brown eyes and our blonde, red, light brown, dark brown, auburn and black hair.</p>

<p>From the article: <i>An Influx of Asians are Having Plastic Surgery to Look More Western</i></p>
<p><i>Dr Kim says his clinic, one of the most successful in a city dubbed the &lsquo;plastic surgery capital of Asia,&rsquo; performs 100 surgeries a day.</i></p>
<p><i>&lsquo;They always tell me they don&rsquo;t like their faces,&rsquo; says Dr Kim &lsquo;They want to have some westernized, nice faces. They want to have big eyes like westernized people, high profile, nicer noses.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>The Chinese and Korean patients tell me that they want to have faces like Americans. The idea of beauty is more westernized recently. That means the Asian people want to have a little less Asian, more westernized appearance. They don&rsquo;t like big cheekbones or small eyes. They want to have big, bright eyes with slender, nice facial bones.</i></p>

<p>Can you find ONE plastic surgery clinic in the US that specializes in making White women look more Asian?  </p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>

<p>This is laughable and not true.  I come from a male-heavy family of medical doctors, professors of hard sciences, IT specialists, software designers and entrepreneurs.  I have attended functions with them for years such as company picnics and faculty parties.  I have seen White males with Asian wives but they are  the minority.</p>
<p>Not one of the males in my family is married to an Asian.  Not one of them has ever dated an Asian. Period. This includes three generations all the way down to the ones who are still in college.  ALL of them have White wives or girlfriends.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You are perfectly fine with whites getting displaced in their own countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>You are failing to recognize a difference between Europe and America. America originally belonged to the Amerindians, and I do not see you applying your rule about &#8220;every race having their own country&#8221; to the Amerindians. Now I am not saying that America should be returned to the Amerindians either; I am merely saying that you cannot use the same arguments for Europe as for America, because whites were also immigrants. For America, the best we can do is an immigration policy that excludes low-IQ people. That would actually be a perfectly nice America to live in by any standards, with safe neighborhoods and no permanent welfare class.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are basing your argument on a hypothesis.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was criticizing your argument, not providing an argument of my own. To repeat, you are trying to claim that Asians are bad for America. I am asking you how they are bad for America, since the stats (lower crime, higher income, etc.) show they are good for America. You responded that we didn&rsquo;t need Asians to land on the moon. I responded that this is not a valid argument that Asians are bad for America. Please take it from here again.</p>
<p>My teeth don&rsquo;t need brushing in order to chew food. Does that mean brushing is bad for my teeth? By your logic, yes. Do you see a problem?</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobel Prize winners&#8221;</p>
<p>To say nothing of the fact that Nobel Prizes are a subjective award, Nobel Prize winners are a TINY SAMPLE of specialist people, all statistical outliers hardly representative of the group as a whole. Why are you so afraid of using statistics that involve the ENTIRE group being measured, such as crime rates and average incomes?</p>
<p>&#8220;Whites have outmatched everyone else&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter how many times John Engelman and others have demolished you on this, you keep acting as if nothing had happened&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says most men in the world find what you just described attractive?&#8221;</p>
<p>Men are hard-wired to be attracted to phenotypical clues of a woman&rsquo;s youth and fertility. It is an evolutionary psychological adaptation. The traits I listed all correlate strongly with youth and fertility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most men on Amren&#8221;</p>
<p>Only the WNs. And we all know they have a dogma to uphold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a lot of Asian women trying to look like white women, but not the other way around.&#8221;</p>
<p>When a white woman waxes, or uses deoderant, or uses skin cream, or slims down, she is (whether she realizes it or not) trying to look more Asian, since she is aiming at an appearance more frequently possessed by Asians naturally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most white guys I see with Asian girls are short and nerdy&#8221;</p>

		<p><i>America originally belonged to the Amerindians.</i></p>
<p>There was no &#8220;America&#8221; before Whites created it.</p>
<p>You come here because of what Whites have created and you know it.</p>
<p>Native Americans were a stone age population without a written language.  They created exactly nothing. They were not united in any way.</p>
<p>No one is breaking down the borders of the United States because of what the Native American population created.  Non-Whites from everywhere flee the messed-up countries they created for themselves to join White societies.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>Why are Asians not capable of creating what we Whites have created for ourselves?  Why do you need to come here to displace us?  If you are SO smart and SO attractive why come here?  </p>
<p>How many Whites are trying to barge into non-White nations?  Demanding entry and preferences and privileges?</p>
<p>Why are Asians allowed to form advocacy and political pressure groups in the United States but not Whites?  Asians come here to form colonies, displace the native population and advocate for Asians and Asians only.</p>
<p>Sort of like why you come here to denigrate us.</p>
<p> Whites who even deign to do the exact same thing allowed every other racial/ethnic group are called Nazis, fascists and supremacists, our meetings shut down through threats of violence.</p>
<p>Here is an article about Asians supremacy written by Jared Taylor:</p>
<p><i>Asians &mdash; those smart, hard-working people you&rsquo;ve always been told believe in merit and would never act like the NAACP or La Raza &mdash; have joined the racial spoils system. They have gotten in right at the top, and they are playing dirty.</i></p>
<p>If Whites were to do this it would be called a hate group and the DOJ would be investigating.</p>
<p>Wanting to preserve one&rsquo;s race is NOT White Supremacist no matter what the government or DOJ say.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough we have to fight the White-hating government without having to fight White-hating Asian supremacists as well.</p>

		<p>#1.  Why am I seeing so many Asian chauvinists on these threads lately?</p>
<p>I though this was a venue to discuss White issues, not to constantly battle arrogant Asians and John Engelman who constantly insult Whites by claiming we are unintelligent and unattractive.</p>
<p>&gt;What is your goal here?</p>
<p><i>To follow the Jefferson quote that defines AmRen: &ldquo;There is not a truth existing which I fear or would wish unknown to the whole world.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Oh, really?  Your purpose here isn&rsquo;t to lecture us Whites as to how superior Asians are in intelligence in looks?  Or why we Whites should roll over, let you flood and colonize our homelands and take over what we have created?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re here for the truth?  OK:</p>
<p>How about The Truth about how Asians steal White technology because they can&rsquo;t create their own.  How about The Truth that Asian women have plastic surgery to make themselves look like more far more attractive White women.  How about The Truth that Asians flock to White countries but Whites do not leave their countries to join Asian societies?</p>
<p><i>When a white woman waxes, or uses deoderant, or uses skin cream, or slims down, she is (whether she realizes it or not) trying to look more Asian, since she is aiming at an appearance more frequently possessed by Asians naturally.</i></p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re being downright ridiculous.  NO White woman waxes, uses deodorant, skin creams or slims down to make herself look more Asian &#8220;whether she realizes it or not.&#8221;  Your claim is beyond risible.</p>

		<p><i>Also, Asian-white marriages are statistically more frequent than black-white marriages, and the children of Asian-white marriages have higher average IQ than white children.</i></p>
<p>Prove it.  </p>
<p><i>Those of us with Asian spouses probably know what I am talking about.</i> </p>
<p>Like the two guys I work with who divorced their Asians spouses when they found out they were nothing but scammers who wanted to bring over their entire families?  Both Asian spouses claimed spousal abuse (they knew what they were doing) and demanded large divorce settlements (which they also seemed to know a lot about).  One said his worst nightmare would be to wake up and find himself lying next to his first wife.  Both are married to white wives now.</p>
<p><i>I expect marriage to Asians will, over time, become as accepted within race-realist circles as marriage to Italians or Poles.</i></p>
<p>Not a chance.  Asians do not carry the genetics for blue or green eyes or red, blond or brown hair. </p>

		<p>To all the complainers, for the last time, this is not a WN forum, this is an RR forum. No one should be telling anyone else to self-censor. Realism is about saying things and hearing things even if egos will be bruised as a result. So far, I have not seen one RR who has demanded WNs stop talking about certain topics, but I see a number of WNs demanding RRs to stop talking about certain topics. WNs should therefore reconsider whether they care more about realism or more about feeling good.</p>

		<p><i>So far, I have not seen one RR who has demanded WNs stop talking about certain topics, but I see a number of WNs demanding RRs to stop talking about certain topics.</i></p>
<p>What topics?  Stop talking about what?</p>
<p>How about telling a few of the arrogant Asians I see on here frequently to stop with the &#8220;hate-White&#8221; comments, especially those directed at White women.</p>
<p>I will not stand by while Asians malign and demean Whites, especially White women.  If that makes me a &#8220;RR&#8221; or a &#8220;WN&#8221; then so be it.  I don&rsquo;t even know what those two terms mean, I am only interested in standing up for Whites against haters like the Asian poster (or poseur) on this thread.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;d like to know is this:  Why is AR allowing Asians to frequently come on here to post insulting and demeaning comments about Whites?  These comments seem to be increasing in number across all of the threads on this forum, so much so that I am reconsidering my support of AR.  I am sick and tired of reading comments that refer to White women as &#8220;mannish&#8221; or that White men reject them in favor of &#8220;more attractive&#8221; Asian women, that &#8220;White-Asian children have higher IQs&#8221; than White children and White women are &#8221; aggressive and self-centered&#8221; drivers.</p>
<p>All of this seems to be stated with little to no rebuttal except from Courtney and Bon, two anonymous posters and myself, MEGO. (excellent commentary, Courtney, keep it up).</p>
<p>I do not come here to read noxious comments written by  white-hating Asians.<br>

		<p>&#8220;You are failing to recognize a difference between Europe and America.&#8221;</p>
<p>What? You only mentioned Eastern Europe as the only area for white people, and so likewise I argued with you on that note. So how are you jumping to the conclusion that I fail to see the difference between Europe (as a whole) and America? That is a great leap you took there from conclusion to conclusion. You are making less and less sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was criticizing your argument, not providing an argument of my own. To repeat, you are trying to claim that Asians are bad for America. I am asking you how they are bad for America, since the stats (lower crime, higher income, etc.) show they are good for America. You responded that we didn&rsquo;t need Asians to land on the moon. I responded that this is not a valid argument that Asians are bad for America. Please take it from here again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again you have lost me. I never said directly that &#8216;Asians are bad for America&rsquo;. Stop making these kindergarten level arguments against me. Did I ever say Asians have high crime rates?  This is all beside the point.  The point is that Western Civilization has never needed Asians to be what it is.  This is what you fail to understand. Why is it that just within the last 50 years, out of thousands of years, people like you are suddenly insisting that white countries NEED Asians?  Do Asian countries NEED whites?  Doesn&rsquo;t every people group have the right to exist on it&rsquo;s own?</p>
<p>&#8220;To say nothing of the fact that Nobel Prizes are a subjective award, Nobel Prize winners are a tiny sample of specialist people, all statistical outliers hardly representative of the group as a whole. Why are you so afraid of using statistics that involve the entire group being measured, such as crime rates and average incomes?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nobel Prize is subjective only because you want it to be to suit your argument. And you keep making red herring arguments that aren&rsquo;t making any sense.  Again, I never ignored Asian crime rates or incomes. So explain to me why any of this means that white people MUST share their lands with Asians when Asians have all of Asia to live in?  Once again, you are on here to support an anti-white agenda as opposed to make an argument based on facts or fairness.  According to you, I should have to let you live in my home just because you may be good at cleaning up after yourself.  Seriously, that is no different from what you are saying here.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter how many times John Engelman and others have demolished you on this, you keep acting as if nothing had happened&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Another subjective statement.  You make it sound as if I am the only person on Amren making these arguments. Most people on Amren agree with me, as has been proven in this discussion.  And no, John Engelman has never demolished any of my arguments. You must not have been following our debates too closely it seems, either that or you only see what you want to see.</p>
