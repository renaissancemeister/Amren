<h1><a href="http://www.hudson-ny.org/2487/french-suburbs-islamic-societies">French Suburbs Becoming &#8216;Separate Islamic Societies&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Soeren Kern, Hudson New York, October 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France&rsquo;s decrepit city suburbs are becoming &#8216;separate Islamic societies&rsquo; cut off from the state, according to a major new study that examines the spread of Islam in France.</p>
<p>Muslim immigrants are increasingly rejecting French values and identity and instead are immersing themselves in Islam, according to the report, which also warns that Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law in many parts of suburban Paris.</p>
<p>The 2,200-page report, &#8220;Banlieue de la RÃ©publique&#8221; (Suburbs of the Republic), is the result of a one-year research effort into the four &#8220;i&rsquo;s&#8221; that comprise the heart of the debate over French national identity: Islam, immigration, identity and insecurity.</p>
<p>The report was commissioned by the influential French think tank L&rsquo;Institut Montaigne, and directed by Gilles Kepel, a well-known political scientist and specialist in the Muslim world, together with five other French researchers.</p>
<p>The authors of the report show that France, which has between five and six million Muslims (France has the largest Muslim population in European Union), is on the brink of a major social explosion because of the failure of Muslims to integrate into French society.</p>
<p>The report also shows how the problem is being exacerbated by radical Muslim leaders who are promoting the social marginalization of Muslim immigrants in order to create a parallel Muslim society in France that is ruled by Sharia law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The study says that Muslim religious institutions and practices are increasingly displacing those of the state and the French Republic, which has a strong secular tradition.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The researchers also looked into the reasons behind the 2005 riots, which they said had called into question modern France&rsquo;s founding myth, namely &#8220;the implicit shared belief that the nation was always able to integrate people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Islamic values are replacing those of a French Republic which has failed to deliver on its promise of &#8220;equality,&#8221; the report says, and the residents of the suburbs increasingly do not see themselves as French.</p>

		<p>This situation may be marginally tolerable if Islamic people stayed in the same suburb.</p>
<p>But like blacks in this country they will flee those suburbs the first chance they get.</p>
<p>And after blacks and Islamic people destroy where they live they want to move to white Christian areas. </p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s really a coincidence, because the last time I was in France I didn&rsquo;t &#8220;see&#8221; a lot of the people there as being French either.  Maybe these folks should do their homework &amp; find a place where they can &#8220;see&#8221; themselves as &#8220;X&#8221; &amp; relocate there. They would probably be welcomed. Problem solved.</p>

<p><br>
And where else have we seen something like this? Want to break this down? At a minimum, you must stop any additional immigration. If you do, the descendents of existing immigrants will assimilate.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t, you end up with two separate societies. Assimilation is not the simple thing people make it out to be. Lest we forget, in America even European immigrant groups are not all totally assimilated almost a century after the immigrant era ended. Wake up or go to sleep. It&rsquo;s your choice.</p>

		<p>The good news is that they are grouping up where they will be able to be easily identified and deported.  Hopefully France and other European nations will soon throw in the towel on their Diversity experiments and recover their senses and self-respect.</p>

		<p>I was in France and less than 12 years ago there were no Islamic zones. None. You could go anywhere. Now there are dozens where the police can&rsquo;t even go. My prediction is a French civil war in our lifetime. Yes, our side will be small. Yes, they will probably lose. But expect to see it happen. I welcome it.</p>

		<p>This is essentially colonization by a hostile foreign population. These foreigners reject France yet would scream bloody murder if their citizenship were revoked. So what? Revoke their citizenship and let them scream. Whether they are first or second generation gives them no inalienable right to be there. France has no obligation to allow itself to be colonized.</p>
<p>The situation is simple   &mdash;   foreigners have the will to conquer France but do not yet have the power. France has the power to defend itself but it remains to be seen whether they still have the will.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s called celebrating their own culture, not ethnically cleansing white from the area. Now they now live in a completely separate society.</p>
<p>If Algerians can throw the French out of Algeria, because of all the bad influences the French brought, why can&rsquo;t the French kick the Algerians out of France, despite all the improvements they&rsquo;ve made. </p>

		<p>No kidding.  When you import a third world people, you get third world ghettos.  This rhetoric above insinuates that &#8220;integrating&#8221; third world Muslims is somehow a good idea or even desirable, which it is not.  I choose &#8220;France for the French,&#8221; but nobody is asking me.</p>

		<p>The best that can be said about France is that it serves as an object lesson to the those few European nations that haven&rsquo;t embraced mass third world immigration to what the future will hold if mass third world immigration is permitted.<br>
  It is a real life, real time example of the consequences of a dumb out of control political class.A slow motion train wreck.<br>
 The most importing lesson to be learned is that there is no acceptable &#8216;minimum&rsquo; level of third world immigration whatsoever.<br>
  Third world immigration must seen as a soial evil and held at zero.Muslims in France now number 6 million at least.We tend to forget that as recently as 60 or so yeras ago there were practically no muslims in France.When third worlders first began trckling into France, the justification was always that there numbers were small and insignificant compared to the indigenous populaion.</p>

		<p>Regarding the possibility for integration of Muslims in French society, French nationalists often quote the general De Gaulle [speaking to Alain Peyrefitte in 1959]:</p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s very fine that there are yellow French, Black French, Brown French . They show that France is open to all races and has an universal vocation. But under the condition that they remain a small minority. Otherwise, France would no longer be France. We are still pre-eminently a European people of White race, of Greek and Roman culture and of Christian religion. Let us not tell ourselves stories! The Muslims, did you go to see them? Have you looked at them with their turbans and djellabas? You can see well that they are not French! <b>Those who advocate integration have a hummingbird brain, even when they are very learned.</b> Try to incorporate oil and vinegar. Shake the bottle. After a while, they will separate again. Arabs are Arabs, French are French. You believe that the French body can absorb ten million Muslims, who tomorrow will be twenty million and forty the day after tomorrow? If we integrate, if all the Arabs and Berbers of Algeria were considered French, how do we prevent them from coming to settle in metropolitan France, where the standard of living is so much higher? My village would no longer be called Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises[Colombey-the-Two-Churches], but Colombey-les-Deux-Mosques[Colombey-the-Two-Mosques]!</i></p>
<p>De Gaulle is a treasure trove of race realist quotes. Unfortunately, he was our last president with healthy views on this question.</p>

		<p>The French situation is deteriorating day by day. They now have about 750 of these &#8220;sharia zones&#8221;. Five years ago it was only 70. The explosive growth rate of the Islamo-African population is incredible. </p>

		<p>The situation in France is very grave. There are hundreds - hundreds - of &#8220;zones de non-droit&#8221; which the police will not enter except in number. A policeman friend of mine explains that it is a question of self-respect to the police that they will go into any and every area of France, but in the &#8220;zones de non-droit&#8221;the minumum number is 15. If they are only 5, say, they risk being insulted or spat on without being able to arrest anyone because of hostile mobs, and this would be intolerable.<br>
 <br>
This friend is absolutely convinced there will be a civil war in France one day, but I don&rsquo;t agree; I think that with the segregation that has become normal already, even with demographic change and population and economic pressure the situation can be stable for a long time. </p>
<p>There will certainly be civil disturbances and riots, however. And much worse than the last time, 2005. In 2005 there were hundreds of riots throughout France, and in the worst cases the police were shot at, though none were killed. At the time, I was puzzled that the police did not shoot back; I thought it was admirable, if misguided, restraint. I now know better: the police did not shoot back because they could not get clear shots in the dark. Next time will be different; the police have trained teams with night vision equipment, and it is a matter of self-respect for them that no-one can shoot at them with impunity.</p>
<p>The French state has been trying to stave off the next riots by spending more than France can afford in sensitive areas. They have also discreetly but firmly instructed all public bodies to give priority to young people of immigrant origins in employment, at local and national level, as a safety valve; young white people consequently are turned away. But the pressures are too great: the riots will come again, and the next time it will be worse, as the numbers of Africans and North Africas and their anger and confidence - arrogance, even - are ever greater.</p>

		<p>&#8220;France&rsquo;s decrepit city suburbs&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, actually, they were not &#8220;decrepit&#8221; before the african/muslim invasion.</p>
<p>When most of thoses suburbs were built, they were made for upper middle claas, and people (white) were really happy to live there. My wife grew up there, and she has only great memories : modern confort, cleanliness, good neighbouring, no violence&hellip; until the thirld wolders came&hellip;</p>
<p>Regarding a civil war in France, just a question of time. Maybe even in 5-10years or before because of the economic crisis : the gvt can&rsquo;t afford anymore to buy peace&hellip; Look at the AAA ratings after the presidential election in 2012&hellip; And now only the leftits medias (meaning 95% of them) and politicians pretend everything is fine. A lot white are begining to understand.</p>
<p>Some people say that the war has already started (2005), but only few people have noticed and only one side is fighting. &#8220;Conflit civil de basse intensitÃ©&#8221; they say&hellip;</p>

		<p>France went through 12 violent changes of goverment between 1790<br>
and 1875. All the changes were violent and bloody. Millions were killed between 1790 and 1816.</p>
<p>The violence was always caused by leftists, or more realistically, working class cannon fodder rent a mobs paid and manipulated by various elites.</p>
<p>But several decades ago the French left kicked the French working class under the bus and allied itself with the muslims.</p>
<p>So unless the French working class (85 percent of French Whites)<br>
finds itself another leader, there will be no riots and violent changes.</p>
<p>Irish in Paris.  Please keep us posted.  It is nice to know that the French police, unlike the English and American police still have some self respect.  A lot of French police are tightly knit family, class, regional, kinship and religious comrades.  For once, both the Catholics and militant anti clericals might find common ground.</p>
<p>France is not a seperation of church and state nation in the American tradition.  Laicism does not mean separation of church and state. It means the French state is activily anti religious, any religion, not just Catholicism.</p>
<p>If Laicism had been as strictly enforced against islam as it is against Catholicism, these without the law zones would never have been developed.</p>
<p>Legally, all France has to do is enforce laicism as effectively against islam as it enforces laicism against Christianity.</p>

		<p>This might put an end to muslim immigration to Europe.</p>
<p>Yahoo News ^ | Oct 14, 2011 | RAF CASERT<br>
The European Union is considering a roughly 75 percent cut in funding for a program that helps feed 18 million of its poorest citizens. The cuts, set to take effect after New Year&rsquo;s, would come at a time of rising unemployment and consumer food prices in many parts of Europe, as well as overall economic turmoil on the continent. The looming cuts already have raised fears among people who rely heavily on the program. </p>

What you will see, rather any massive evacuation of &#8220;immigrants&#8221; back to their home countries, is a massive increase in crime that will ravage European cities.  If they can&rsquo;t get what they need, they will take it. They will NEVER leave the comforts of Europe voluntarily   &mdash;    only at the point of a gun. <br>
All other policies are useless. </p>
