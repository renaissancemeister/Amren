			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Art Moore, World Net Daily, October 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the second time in less than a week, a major U.S. hotel has canceled an agreement to host an event on radical Islam&rsquo;s threat to America&rsquo;s freedoms, due to threatening messages to management.</p>
<p>The Preserving Freedom Conference, scheduled for Nov. 11 at the top-rated Hutton Hotel in Nashville, Tenn., features Robert Spencer, author and director of Jihad Watch, and Pamela Geller, a WND columnist, editor of the blog Atlas Shrugs and author of the book &#8220;Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.&#8221; WND is a co-sponsor of the conference.</p>
<p>Steve Eckley, senior vice president of hotels for Amerimar Enterprises in Denver  &mdash;  the Hutton Hotel&rsquo;s managing corporation  &mdash;  told WND it was his decision to cancel the event.</p>
<p>Eckley said he &#8220;wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what the content of the program was,&#8221; but he explained that he canceled it because of the threat of physical harm to people at the hotel.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were veiled threats that there were going to be protests that could easily erupt into violence,&#8221; he told WND in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As WND reported last week, the Hyatt Place Hotel in Sugar Land, Texas, near Houston, canceled a tea party event featuring Geller after complaints reportedly by the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Commenting on the Nashville cancellation on her Atlas Shrugs blog, Geller said Eckley &#8220;has caved to Islamic supremacist demands.&#8221;</p>
<p>She warned that free speech, &#8220;the cornerstone of our constitutional republic, is in serious jeopardy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Spencer told WND the conference will go on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will find a new venue,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but the Hutton Hotel&rsquo;s capitulation to Islamic supremacist threats and intimidation is a disgrace and a disquieting reminder of just how much the freedom of speech is threatened in America today.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked to respond to charges that he was &#8220;caving in&#8221; to radical Muslims, Eckley insisted he had &#8220;no idea&#8221; what the sources of the threats &#8220;were complaining about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I am responding to is the threat to my staff and my property,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Eckley said that management received &#8220;several calls, emails, letters and personal calls.&#8221;</p>

		<p>RICO law  &mdash;  perhaps both the civil and criminal recourses contained in it  &mdash;  would seem a huge disincentive to this sort of third party sabotage of lawful and routine bilateral agreements  &mdash;  the moreso, if freedom of speech is involved.

<p>One of the first things the intelligence apparatus looked for when they closed in on Bin Laden&rsquo;s compound was a data line.  Such is the ability of the communications snoopers, they can penetrate land line communications in a hostile country like Pakistan.</p>
<p>Surely there must be a wealth of evidence for Homeland Security and the FBI to track down the individuals who threatened and terrorized the hotel management.  Charges must surely follow.</p>

		<p>Just a reminder:if the 1965 Immigration Reform Act  had not been passed, and if America had a national origins immigration policy that completed excluded Muslims, the probability of 9/11 occuring would have been exactly 0. Moreover, the probability of Muslims shutting down a Patriotic Native Born White American conference would be 0. Muslims are a very very unacceptable alien presence in our America.</p>
<p>So why is this nonsense going on? Answer:The White Liberal Greedy Cheating Class would have us believe that the economic health of the nation requires an immigration policy that floods America with high fertility Muslims&hellip;and in the process,rapidly reducing the Native Born White American Majority to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borers of &#8220;America&#8221;..for otherwise, Native Born White America would never be able to produce its own doctors,nurses,engineers,computer programmers,construction workers,electricians,carpenters,architects&hellip;you name the occupation. This,of course, is manifestly a bold-face lie. The White Greedy Liberal Class is truely an evil cabal.</p>
<p>By the way, the Lutheran Church sponsors interfaith prayer groups on Lutheran property. I visited one of these recently and the first two pews were all filled with muslims&hellip;including an Iman. This is truely unforgivable treasonous and blaphemous syncretism.</p>
<p>Wat Tyler had the  right idea in 1381&hellip;</p>

<p>- Yes. Excellent question. </p>
<p>- When a people (us in this case) give the responsibility of protection of rights to the government, those in government will then come to pick and choose which rights it will protect.  If our representatives are paid off, threatened, disinterested or biased to the point that they will not protect the right of free speech by using the power of law and police force which they have been given, then that right is lost.  We are then given the stark choice to either give in and not speak, or take action among ourselves to protect a right we hold dear. And to take the needed action would of course be seen by our police forces and representatives as being outside the law.  By taking the path of non-action in cases such as this, our government does not guarantee free speech, but does guarantee oppression, which will eventually lead to revolution.</p>

		<p>Another illustration of the fact that you can either have civil society and freedoms, or you can have diversity. You can&rsquo;t have both. All &#8216;diverse&rsquo; states* in history have been authoritarian in order to keep the various factions from fighting each other.</p>
<p>*not &#8220;nations&#8221; or &#8220;countries&#8221;. Most of these diverse states have been empires and those that were not empires were usually failed states.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech either exists in a society or it doesn&rsquo;t, there is no in-between. The last two years of AmRen cancellations and this past week make it abundantly clear that the First Amendment is now but a relic of a once great country called the United States.</p>

<p>I surely hope these communications are being analyzed and traced, for one.  For another, I&rsquo;m willing to bet that it&rsquo;s not all Muslims or possibly even Muslims at all.  The ultra-left American citizenry has perhaps found a new way of shutting their enemies down.</p>
<p>If these indeed turn out to be non-Muslim-source threats, we will NEVER see the results of any investigation.  Either way, this Eckley gentleman, I hope has actually contacted the FBI at the very least.  If he has not he is an abettor.</p>

		<p>The United States of America is a de facto muslim nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our government treats the Koran with a reverence not given to any other item, period.</p>
<p>Our government has toppled governments in Africa, Asia, and Europe in order for muslims to create an islamic state, in addition to the 50+ that already exist.</p>
<p>The government does nothing against islamic bullying and islamic encroachment.</p>
<p>If you are a muslim, you basically can attack the USA with complete impunity, and so long as you don&rsquo;t literally wear a head covering your religion will not get any of the blame.</p>

<p>Gun rights and anti-tax groups still have enough clout to fight back - probably.</p>
<p>But these groups shed nary a tear when AR was violated and I will shed none for them. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;Haters&#8221; who threatened violence didn&rsquo;t win, they lost big time. And so did the followers of Islam. Instead of civilly responding to the critics of Islam they chose the threat of violence. Now the majority of Americans will hear about this story and figure the critics of Islam are right, they are a violent people. Whoever says our cultures can co-exist needs a serious wakeup call.</p>

		<p>Before now, these same mysterious goony birds were almost able to shut down two different AR conferences.  Yet, I don&rsquo;t remember either Spencer or Geller taking up for AR.  Jihad Watch has never mentioned AR (and I read Jihad Watch daily, I would remember if they did), but if they ever did, it would be similar to Spencer&rsquo;s opinion about European nationalist parties, &#8220;wrong&#8221; for being &#8220;racist&#8221; but &#8220;doing the job&#8221; that the lamestream conservative parties refuse to do in combating Islam.</p>
<p>This picnic of theirs was supposed to happen in Nashville.  Even with the growing threat of Islam in Tennessee (mega-mosques have opened up recently in Murfessboro and near Fort Campbell in Clarksville), the average white Tennesseean is still far more likely to die at the hands of a black criminal than a Muslim terrorist attack.  The Islam threat here is not yet existential like it is in Europe.</p>

There is another way.  We can use our rights to protest the government in a very public but legal way.  Politicians hate being called out in public and the voters will get the heads up on who not to vote for again.</p>
<p>I hope that they contact the District Attorney, Governor, FBI and states Attorney General.  There must be lots of conservative talk shows in Texas, as it is a conservative voting state.  We have to make noise.  If muslims can make noise, so can we.</p>

		<p>I doubt either Holder or Napolitano are expending many resources looking into this. I mean, what results did they ever produce regarding the threats against the Amren hotel in Charlotte? Not ONE that I&rsquo;m aware of. Is this a situation in which a corrupt government is running interference for thugs? Attorney General Eric &#8220;My People&#8221; Holder dropping the charges against the club wielding black panther at the voting polls in Philadelphia suggest the answer may be &#8220;yes&#8221;.</p>

		<p>ref. 3,7,8</p>
<p>The federal Privacy Act provides citizens the right (within reasonable limits ) to submit statements (an affidavit format is preferable but not necessary ) to be put in any personal files held under their name by federal agencies.  It is relevant that those of us who&rsquo;ve attended AR meetings have seen no evidence of, or even suggestions of, illegal activity, emotional arousal toward violence or incivility, or anything else that could remotely be considered a justification for denial of the rights of assembly and speech.  It is fatuous to assume otherwise than that a troubling number of Conference attendees have been $tooges and a$sets of those $pecializing in &#8220;hating hate&#8221;  &mdash;  so even one a$set  feeding off another can give rise to contrived nonsense in files that if not counteracted genuinely can be milked and milked for smear and disinformation purposes.  </p>

<p>- Thank you for your response.  I must admit though that I have very limited faith that we will take such a path of action (I know I will not) or that any such action would gain the desired result.  My mindset is as such:</p>
<p>- Most voters keep voting for the same anti-White, anti-American politicians as it is, and those politicians have no fear of pushing the multicultural, anti-White, anti-American, anti-U.S. Constitution agenda.</p>
<p>- Any pro-White candidate is roundly condemned by the media while all other candidates either remain silent or join in the condemnation.</p>
<p>- Our politicians do have a fear of doing anything that would be perceived as anti-Muslim or anti-Liberal, and as such, our freedoms (of speech in this case) continue to erode.</p>
<p>- I will take a guess, and say that you and I are of a different demographic.  My guess is that you are both younger than I, and also have less of a family history in America.  I may be wrong, but that is my perception based only upon our comments so far. I don&rsquo;t dislike you. I&rsquo;m just saying that we have a very different perspective on how situations such as the oppression of freedom of speech will end up being resolved.</p>
<p>- Our representatives in government have been given the faith and trust of the people to, above all else, be the defenders of our nation and to take action to defend our rights.  When they actively choose to both destroy our nation through current immigration policy and to suppress our rights through inaction, they increase the ever present risk that the people will reach a point of having to clarify their rights by themselves.  As for me, I can&rsquo;t see taking to the streets to &#8220;protest&#8221; for rights that we already have.  To put it another way, if ever I should reach a point of going &#8220;out&#8221; to protest, it won&rsquo;t be to protest with signs and slogans. </p>

<p>The Left, from the limp wristed &#8220;Professors&#8221; to the hardcore Communists, and every other fruit loop out there, works togther, for the common destruction of our country, and our Civilization. </p>

<p>It is just as important to call on the end of Immigration, and the Deportation of Illegal Aliens, and to repeal the 1965 Immigration Reform Act, as it is to repeal NAFTA, and to get out of the UN. </p>

		<p>A big problem for those seeking to use fear tactics to get<br>
Hotels to deny opportunities for peaceful and lawful assembly and speech is that within the leadership ranks of the vast liability insurance industry, this sort of political antic is<br>
very unwelcome for very very practical reasons.  If the particular companies that carry the liability coverage for a Hotel have a wide number of their in-house lawyers informed of what&rsquo;s going on, such awareness tends to be an important disincentive or even obstacle to those wanting to prevent free speech.     The general tactic for tricksters is to narrow<br>
the &#8220;in house&#8221; awareness to one or two adjusters  within the insurance carrier&rsquo;s home office, or at most to one or two lawyers within the large legal staff.    <br>
