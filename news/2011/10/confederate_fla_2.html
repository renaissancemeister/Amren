<h1>Confederate Flag Causes Race War</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rachel Glaser, ABC 57, October 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Classrooms were noticeably empty at Dowagiac Union High School on Thursday. It&rsquo;s been almost a week since administrators banned students from wearing anything with the Confederate flag. </p>
<p>Since then, things at the school have been tense, &#8220;It&rsquo;s been really hectic, pretty awkward,&#8221; Brittany Williams said. </p>
<p>Thursday was a half day for students, Williams and her friend spent the day downtown trying to escape the controversy at the high school. </p>
<p>&#8220;They need to stop. They&rsquo;re doing it on purpose just to agitate people,&#8221; Williams said.</p>
<p>To her, it&rsquo;s not just the Confederate flag she finds offensive, it&rsquo;s the students who are wearing it and their reasoning behind it. &#8220;A lot of them don&rsquo;t interact with black people,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;So a lot of them, I think, are being racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re just standing up for what we believe in,&#8221; Wayne Matthews said. He&rsquo;s one of the students who helped pass out t-shirts before school Wednesday morning. His mother made 32 Confederate flag t-shirts and stacked them up in the back of her trunk.</p>
<p>Williams lives next door to the Matthews family, &#8220;They&rsquo;ve never liked us and we never did anything to them, so I do think it&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthews said this has nothing to do with race; it&rsquo;s about his right to freely express himself. To him, the Confederate flag does not represent any one race. &#8220;It stands for people that believe in what the Civil War is about and it stands for Southern pride,&#8221; Matthews said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, the battle over the Confederate flag has only created more boundaries between different races and groups at the high school. Threats of violence have been exchanged both at the school and on the web.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Matthews said when he walked into school in his t-shirt, another student threatened to beat him up. &#8220;I was confronted by one, a colored kid and he was calling me names and stuff.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police officers have posted up outside the school for the last two days, and the school&rsquo;s administration told students they are looking into all of the threats. The students who wore the Confederate flag t-shirts to school on Wednesday did not return the next day.</p>
<p>Gabrielle Williams said she&rsquo;s not sure how the students will heal, she said this has turned into another race war and it will be difficult to move on from here. </p>
<p>&#8220;People that are still angry about it, people that won&rsquo;t let it go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I really think that they&rsquo;re going to be targeted when this is all over with.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So what if these flag-wearing students actually DON&rsquo;T like blacks?  There&rsquo;s no way blacks, liberal whites, or anyone else can make them!  When political correctness shut down most racial public discourse, some blacks complained that it had all just gone beneath the surface and was worse for it.  Well, it probably had worsened, since whites had every reason to resent blacks for the shutdown.  <br>
Blacks have to earn white people&rsquo;s respect and/or affection just like anyone else would.  How obtuse can someone be not to see this?</p>

<p>Blacks have clearly told whites what words they can&rsquo;t say, what symbols they can&rsquo;t display, decorations and so on.  If anyone rebels against this (I like that word here), they can be expected not to &#8220;heal&#8221; from the &#8220;damage&#8221; and be expected to &#8220;rebalance&#8221; themselves through some activities that may target an occasional white.  They&rsquo;re just helping us all keep order in our free society.</p>

		<p>Slavery was wrong.  Importing tens of thousands of africans to this land was wrong.  We all agree on that.</p>
<p>But see how they are making the confederate flag out to be like a nazi symbol?  The confederacy was made up of a lot of diverse white people, most of whom had no slaves and little to no contact with them.  </p>
<p>The war was about differing ways of life, economies and regionalism, and slavery was not the greatest component of that fight.  But racial-hustlers have rewritten the meaning of symbolism to say that the historical symbol of a rebellion is equal to racism and is anti-black.  </p>
<p>So before the civil war, the flag of the land had 13 stripes and 35 stars.  It flew over a land that allowed slavery on at least part of its territory.  So is the stars and stripes racist too?</p>

		<p>The Confederate flad didn&rsquo;t start a race war at the school, it was the emotional and (if not already, soon) violent actions that the PC witch hunters and/or race baiters committed using the flag as a pretext/excuse.  </p>

		<p>Wrong headline.  It&rsquo;s not the CBF clothing and shirts that&rsquo;s causing a race war, it&rsquo;s black crime and hate and intolerance towards white symbolism.  Various Federal courts have ruled that clothing prohibitions in public schools can&rsquo;t be single-edged swords.</p>

<p>Claiming the incident &#8220;turned&#8221; into another &#8220;race war&#8221; is just her ignorant, lying black take on the situation, because there&rsquo;s no school in the country with a black population that isn&rsquo;t embroiled in black on white harassment, intimidation, and assaults.</p>
<p>The confederate flag emblem is more likely than not a response to black racist provocation toward the white students, since this is Michigan and not a southern state.</p>
<p>Let them rave on, though, because we&rsquo;re getting very near the time when this constant black trouble making is going to experience a thunderous backlash.</p>
<p>I can feel it coming. </p>

<p>Amazing. She has the ability to read people&rsquo;s hearts and figure out what their motives are. On the side, I wonder if anyone ever does anything to irritate Whites? And I wonder if anyone cares?</p>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;To her, it&rsquo;s not just the Confederate flag she finds offensive, it&rsquo;s the students who are wearing it and their reasoning behind it. &ldquo;A lot of them don&rsquo;t interact with black people,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;So a lot of them, I think, are being racist.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I find a lot of things offensive. I have to keep quiet about it or I&rsquo;m a very evil person. You, on the other hand, get a podium to blast from because of your skin color.</p>
<p>BTW, when was the last time you interacted with some Vietnamese? You probably don&rsquo;t do it often. This makes you a racist.</p>

What if White students found the image of Martin Luther King offensive?  Would the school back them in prohibiting MLK celebrations?<br>
<p><br>
Certainly any sane discussion of MLK would bring out his pro-Black and anti-White goals.  Also MLK is widely known as sexual immoral by traditional Christian values.  MLK good friend and pro Black associate, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy confirmed MLK&rsquo;s sexual immorality.<br>
<p><br>
Compare MLK&rsquo;s libertine life style to Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s and Jefferson Davis&rsquo; virtuous life style.  Compare MLK&rsquo;s treatment of women to the average Southerners&rsquo; treatment.<br>

		<p>Is it me or does it seem strange that kids up in Michigan are sporting a Confederate flag? Mississippi okay. Michigan? This doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. I live in Northern Ohio and I speak like a &#8220;Yankee&#8221; according to people in my own state who live no more than two hours South of me. Yes I guess it&rsquo;s a geographical thing. The Michigan border is only 1&1/2 hours from my hometown and I&rsquo;ve been up to Detroit on business and casino gambling. I&rsquo;ve never seen a Confederate flag up there. I don&rsquo;t see any in Cleveland either. I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine why. But in the rural areas it is more en vogue to fly them I guess. But it still seems weird. I don&rsquo;t have anything against most of the South. Of course the ones who are still fighting the war who don&rsquo;t like us Northerners can just go learn to read and write and be grateful that us &#8220;snowbirds&#8221; are spending money in their states. If not then I would consider them no different than the Caribbeans who hold grudges against Americans (see Whites) for being on their land. </p>

<p>*She also said you don&rsquo;t always see the looks or hear all the comments, but &ldquo;&hellip;Behind closed doors, yeah, I think racism is alive in this city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So let me get this straight - she doesn&rsquo;t acually SEE the looks or HEAR the comments but yet she just KNOWS there just HAS to be racism somewhere! Unbelievable!</p>

		<p>When I was in high school, Blacks went around wearing Malcolm X hats and necklaces with Africa on them. Nobody really complained or cared. Blacks will use any excuse for violence. The Confederates were in their rights to want to leave the union and it&rsquo;s a part of USA history and heritage. Also, so what if they don&rsquo;t like blacks. Even when whites try to be nice and civil, it&rsquo;s clear blacks don&rsquo;t like whites no matter what. </p>

		<p>The &#8220;Social Construct&#8221; of race seems to rear it&rsquo;s ugly head again and again, generation after generation.  Amazing how tribalism will always effect the human population as long as we all have the ability to see.  </p>
<p>I quote Abraham Lincoln:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.&#8221;</p>
<p>The operative word there is &#8220;physical difference&#8221;.  Those who look alike will get along more than those who do not.  It&rsquo;s so simple it&rsquo;s funny.  </p>
<p>These kids don&rsquo;t seem to understand that everyone is tribal - these white kids have pride.  Let them have it - because it&rsquo;s part of their nature and part of everyone&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>School &#8220;administrators banned students from wearing anything with the Confederate flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>How is this action even constitutional? The supreme court (in Tinker v. Des Moines) upheld the right of students to wear armbands to protest the Vietnam war back in the 60s. I don&rsquo;t really see how is this any different.  Students don&rsquo;t leave their right to free speech and expression at the school house door according that decision. </p>

<p>I grew up in Flint, MI where there are many people from the South-especially Ark.-who came to work in the auto factories. And some Michiganians who have no Southern roots became Copperheads after attending Flint schools.  For many of us, the Confederate Flag is a protest symbol against Black crime and violence and a government that stabs white people in the back.</p>

		<p>President Grant was asked after the civil war if he had been born in the south would he have fought for the south in the war.  He said &#8220;Certainly&#8221;  Black folk want to dominate eveything and to run the whole country accoring to their standards.  racism is a much over used term that allows black folk to dominate.</p>

		<p>The confederate flag, like &#8220;the N word&#8221; is just a power play they assert against Whites because Whites put up with it.  The Postal Service used to make metal pins in the design of commemerative stamps.  The Christmas stamp pins were especially popular at my office around the holidays.  One day I decided to show my support for the good citizens of Georgia who were fighting to keep there old state flag from being changed.  For those of you unfamiliar, the old state flage was half confederate flag.  Back in 1976 the Postal Service made pins to match there 50 state flags commerative stamps.  I happened to have the Georgia flag pin and wore it to work.  It wasn&rsquo;t long before my supervisor came over to tell me she had recieved a complaint that I was wearing an &#8220;offensive pin&#8221;.  I told her the pin I had on was manufactured by the Postal Service and told her if I was ordered to remove it I would, but I would also file a grievance and an EEO complaint.  I suggested that if the news got whiff of my complaints it would make an interesting story, the Postal Service banning it&rsquo;s own product from it&rsquo;s employees.  It was a &#8220;go ahead, make my day&#8221; sort of challenge and the supervisor backed down.  You can get away with stuff like that when you&rsquo;re the union president and have enough seniority to walk out the door any time you like.  My post office by the way, was in Illinois.  So come on all you Yankees.  Get behind our White brothers and stand up for their flag in any little way you can.</p>

I always said the young whites are different from their parents. Yes we have more brainwashing now than they had in 1968. But we have the Internet now and have to live more with them than in 1968.</p>
<p>You can teach thousands of lessons on why a blue sky means rain and a cloudy sky means sunshine. Some will believe it. But if they get out, they will know when to take the umbrella.</p>
<p>In Germany the biggest agenda of the past decade was to make people believe Turks are just like whites and fit into the culture. But the moment the students get into buses, go to school, walk home at night, they know which places and areas they have to avoid.</p>

<p><i>I live in Northern Ohio and I speak like a &ldquo;Yankee&rdquo; according to people in my own state who live no more than two hours South of me. Yes I guess it&rsquo;s a geographical thing. </i></p>
<p>Since you&rsquo;re a self-described &#8220;yankee&#8221; I&rsquo;ll clue you in. It&rsquo;s not entirely a geographical thing. I&rsquo;d be a Southerner regardless of where I lived. I consider it an ethnicity and not just where I was born.</p>
<p><i>the ones who are still fighting the war who don&rsquo;t like us Northerners can just go learn to read and write and be grateful that us &ldquo;snowbirds&rdquo; are spending money in their states.</i></p>
<p>From my perspective, whatever problems exist aren&rsquo;t caused by Southerners but Northerners. If a Northerner has a problem in the South it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re wearing their anti-southern bigotry on their sleeve. But all a Southerner has to do to experience prejudice and harassment in the North is to just <i>be there</i>. I&rsquo;ve experienced it myself on a number of occasions. I noticed you couldn&rsquo;t help taking a little dig even in that comment. And you talk about others &#8220;still fighting the war&#8221;? Wake up. YOU are part of the problem.</p>

		<p>If I walk onto the MIT campus I will become aware in a very short time that I am out of my league.  I will not be accepted as an equal.  The faculty and students won&rsquo;t interact with me.<br>
<p><br>
White people do not understand that this is how a Black person feels around White people. <br>
<p><br>
I don&rsquo;t need to belong to MIT.  I can accept my status and go where the air is not so thin.  Blacks cannot; they need to belong to the White world.  The Civil Rights Movement is Black people attaching themselves to White people.  <br>
<p><br>
What is happening to Blacks in America is what would happen to me if I forced my way onto MIT.  Some people would be nice to me, but I know I don&rsquo;t belong and I know they don&rsquo;t want me there.   <br>

		<p>There is nothing inherently anti-Black about the Confederate flag.  I mean it does not have the N-word on it.<br>
<p><br>
Liberals tell us all the time that no one is born a racist, but that White supremacist upbringing and White privilege turns un-racist White babies into racist men and women.<br>
<p><br>
So is a Black person born with a fear and trembling of the Confederate flag.  I don&rsquo;t think so.  Any Black that is upset by the Confederate flag has been conditioned to be upset.  He was not born that way.  <br>
<p><br>
We spend hundreds of billions of dollars teaching Black kids.  Isn&rsquo;t it time we spent some of that money teaching them not to get upset by a Confederate flag?  That way White kids can display the Confederate flag and the Black kids can just be ho hum.<br>

		<p>When I was young I was for the North.  I remember watching a Maverick episode and I was happy to hear that although Bret Maverick (good White role model) was in the Confederate Army he joined the North to get out of a Yankee a prison to fight the Indians.<br>
<p><br>
We never gave the Civil War much thought.  The good guys of the North led by saintly Abe Lincoln freed the slaves.  I was floored when in Catholic high school a priest history teacher informed us that the Emancipation Proclamation did not free one slave.  I mention it was a Catholic high school because I known that public school kids did not get this information, and I doubt that they do today.<br>
<p><br>
Gradually I came to the conclusion that Lee and the South were the good guys and Lincoln and the North were the bad guys.  And neither the men of the North nor the South fought to end or preserve slavery.  If the newly minted idea of &ldquo;social justice&rdquo; has any merit at all it must mean the South had a right and duty to its people to secede from the Union.<br>
<p><br>
The Confederate flag issue is another example of why we have so much trouble with Blacks.  They are as children, irrational, impetuous, and they are spoiled children to boot.  Jefferson Davis could have just as well freed all the slaves in the North with his own Emancipation Proclamation, thus the Union flag would traumatize every Black person today.<br>

		<p>@14:  You just confirmed what most Southerners were taught growing up-many Northerners are arrogant and overbearing.  Telling us to &#8220;learn to read&#8221; is childish, and ignores the fact that some of the best 20th century American literature is by us ignorant, toothless southerners.  Perhaps you have heard of Faulkner, Welty, and Wolfe?  We have a lot of people from Michigan and northern Ohio passing through my Virginia town on the way to their vacations.  Why can&rsquo;t y&rsquo;all be friendly like the Canadians? </p>
<p>It is not clear from the story how this flag controversy got started, but the boy who was wearing it has every right to do so.  It is not the business of the public schools to engage in viewpoint discrimination. If a kid wears an Irish flag, or St. George&rsquo;s cross, or the flag of Uruguay, I am sure someone, somewhere will be offended.  What is really offensive is the violence against whites and asians going on in the cities.</p>

		<p>I read this and recalled an incident that occurred at Robert E Lee high school in Tyler, Texas back in the 90s. A student wore a Confederate flag t-shirt to school and was sent home. Of course the usual suspects went into emotional breakdown. A local TV station interviewed a couple of black girls and one of them made the remark &#8220;&hellip;and they wonder why black people riot and burn&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to fully understand or comprehend why the people of my race have capitulated so completely that they are so willing to let blacks hold their feelings and possible reactions over their heads like a Sword of Damocles.</p>

<p>I find this quite hateful and divisive yet nobody on here has called this poster out on this. Why are Northerners allowed to post hateful things about Southerners on this website but when a poster such as myself shows any sort of Southern pride, I get labeled as &#8220;divisive&#8221;?</p>
<p>I agree that we are all in this together.  I went to an Amren conference and I was so happy to see so many name tags from New York and California.  I felt like we were all one big family.  But it is when I see comments like the one above, that I can&rsquo;t help but be a bit bitter towards Northerners.  I have met enough in life who enjoy looking down on the South, so it really hurts me when I have to see such a statement on a website like this.  Unbelievable.  </p>
<p>As for my view on people in Michigan wearing the flag?  I agree with the posters who say it is odd.  All I ask is that people understand it&rsquo;s meaning and wear it for the right reason if they aren&rsquo;t Southerners.  Too many people use it for strictly white pride reasons and meanwhile so many Southerners in the South just want to use it to celebrate our culture and heritage, yet there are other people who are ruining it for us.  All I ask is do some research first if you want to use it as your symbol.</p>
<p>It appears that the kids in this story wore it for the right reason, so I am not blaming them.</p>

		<p>The hypocrisy is overwhelming. Blacks can parade around their &#8220;Black Power&#8221; flags, the Red, Black, and Green rag, and Whites are just supposed to accept it. </p>
<p>Well, right back at you. Grow the hell up and accept the Confederate flag for what it is; a regional, American flag, which is as American as the Gadsden flag, the first Colonial Stars and Stripes from Betsy Ross, and the &#8220;Appeal to Heaven&#8221; flag. </p>
<p>These blacks are just looking for a reason to start a fight. </p>
<p>I wore a Confederate flag belt buckle all through my High School years. It wasn&rsquo;t a political statement. I just liked it, plus I had cousins that moved to a Southern State when they were very young, so they were immersed in Southern culture from an early age. </p>
<p> I respect those Southerns that want to maintain their unique Culture, which makes them who they are. </p>

		<p>Right on Courtney from Alababa! We have enough problems without Northern and Southern Whites constant bickering over ancient history. Every time the issue of the Civil War comes up, no matter what pro White site I&rsquo;m on, it always leads to an argument. Enough of this nonsense already. We all have pride (or most of us do) in where we come from, and we should respect that in each other. My family have lived in the South for centuries, and there&rsquo;s no doubt there is strong Southern Pride in all of us, but I didn&rsquo;t realize just how stong it was &#8216;til I announced I would be marrying a guy from BOSTON, who had moved down South as a teenager. You&rsquo;re marrying a damn Yankee they said? Yes, I am, I told them, and take it or leave it. They love him now just as much as I do, so we CAN get over it. And of course we share the same views, although I may be a little more vigorous in mine.</p>
<p>I also agree with you that if those boys up North want to wear the Confederate Flag, understand what it means and stands for, and if they do, they have my blessing.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it amazing that the very first slaves in America were actually white, not black, and that many blacks owned slaves. In fact, the first man to own a black slave for life in America was a black man. Some how nobody hears about this in history. I think what we better realize is that whites are more likely to be descendants of slavery than the majority of blacks are. In fact, blacks enslaved their own people first. It is about time the truth be known. The Shawnee Indians use to go to white settlements in Virginia and kidnap white people and make slaves of them in the salt mines, sliver mines, and so forth in Ohio. Nothing is said about that. The first people in North America, Central America, and South America were white Europeans, not the American Indians. Why don&rsquo;t we hear nothing about that. Whites have nothing to be ashamed of or guilty from. The whites were the first to do everything. In fact blacks have never even established a culture or a civilization. If it wasn&rsquo;t for white people blacks would still be chucking spears, and they know it. </p>

		<p>Im from Massachusetts, and now I live in California. That must sound awful to some Southerners (in many ways it is). I imagine you think I am some arrogant liberal who loves the Kennedys and disdains the South. I am none of those things. I am racially aware and I am completely against forced integration. Several of my relatives have been attacked by blacks. I am not liberal and I believe there is an ongoing race war against us. My point is that you should not assume that all northerners are exactly the same. It&rsquo;s just not true.</p>
<p>As for the South,  I enjoy visiting there.  I have enjoyed meeting people of all races there. I admire their politeness and morality. I have nothing against the confederate flag. I do not wear the flag because I have no connection to it. I always liked that flag and accepted it as part of American history and culture.  I think it&rsquo;s disgusting that it is given the stigma of a nazi symbol. It is an example of liberals trying to rewrite history. </p>
<p>Some like to split hairs about the civil war. There were atrocities committed by both sides. I have distant ancestors on both sides.  I honestly harbor no ill will. NO ONE today was alive during that period. It is a moot point for me. It&rsquo;s over. We need to focus on the current civil war that has been declared against whites.</p>
<p> If you say that you are glad that white Northerners are killed by blacks, that is sick and you do not belong on this site. Forced bussing destroyed northern cities. Many white students and teachers were brutalized during this period&hellip;assault, theft,  rape, murder.  The advent of section 8 housing had the same effect. Most white northerners do not support these horrible programs.  Killing innocent whites, whether in Boston, Memphis or Sydney is pure genocide. Do not follow in the foot steps of white liberals. Do not support your own genocide. </p>

<p>Northerners have been prejudiced against Southerners for a very long time. Even Northerners who are <i>cautious</i> of blacks themselves take a perverse joy in the racial problems Southerners have faced. Now THAT is what&rsquo;s sick. And that attitude is nearly universal among Northerners.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&rsquo;t anyone consider it poetic justice when those SAME hypocritical Northerners get a taste of their own medicine? Lose your anti-Southern prejudice and maybe I&rsquo;ll care. Until then, I&rsquo;ll reserve my sympathies for those who deserve it.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see anyone attacked, regardless of their race.  Further, I am willing to tolerate the funny accent you have when speaking English, but you must concede that Southerners are not less intelligent than Northerners are.  I have actually had Northerners tell me &#8220;I didn&rsquo;t think someone with your accent could be smart&#8221;.  The historical legacy of Lincoln and Reconstruction has been the concentration of political power in the federal government which has made all this PC nonsense possible.  This perversion of true federalism has created the mess we now live in.  </p>
<p>Thus, as a matter of history, it is the north, and not the South that bears responsibilty. </p>
<p>Your quip about &#8220;learning to read&#8221; should have been saved for the leftists, and other anti-Europeans.  Rather than wasting energy on this we should be expressing support for these students in their fight against the PC machine.</p>
<p>Finally, many northerners are polite, and midwesterners almost always are nice.</p>

		<p>I have never seen any comments from Southerners getting excited that Northerners got attacked.  I think that is a ridiculous exaggeration, but then again, I am not 100% sure.  I myself have said that I enjoy seeing Northerners such as Barbara Walters on The View get a taste of their own medicine when lectured on the &#8220;n&#8221; word.  I have said things like that which is completely different than what Who in their White Mind accused any of us of saying.  Something tells me he is taking something I said out of context. And considering all the hate from Northerners that I have witnessed first hand in life, I could care less if what I said offended him.  I think Southerners have every reason to be angry quite frankly.  No, this doesn&rsquo;t mean we should get excited when someone is physically assualted, but as I just said, I highly doubt anyone on here has said that. </p>
<p>As an aside, I don&rsquo;t agree with the endless comments from Northerners on this website that &#8220;most of us aren&rsquo;t hostile towards the South&#8221;.  In my own personal experience, I have met people from all over the country who I ran into either because they came South to live or I went up North on vacation.  More often than not it seems that I try to be as polite as I can be but then the Northerner whether they are from Michigan, Ohio, or New York, always makes a point to crack some redneck joke about the state I am from for no reason at all. Either that or they start talking about how we burn crosses on our lawns. It is as if they are so insecure about something that they just feel the need to shove it in my face at some point.  Again, this is after I said absolutely NOTHING offensive towards them.  And I won&rsquo;t even go into what I have seen on the internet. I&rsquo;m sorry, but I am just not convinced that enough Northerners really respect the South.</p>

<p>If this one sentence from Abraham Lincoln does not clarify the issue of the Civil War for people, then they&rsquo;re brain-dead:</p>

<p>We should display our own symbols like the Confederate flag and use our own terms.

		<p>Courtney from Alabama. I know for certain that there were a couple of posters from the South who took a sick joy in learning that a Philadelphia White man and his family had their home invaded by a pack of sub-Saharans. The story basically started off with a group of White kids laughing at a Sub-Saharan because he fell off his bicycle. He went and got his homies and tried to break into a White man&rsquo;s home and threatened his wife and twin toddler sons. They had to move out of the house, but last reported, the man was still in the house to watch over it so it&rsquo;s not vandalized, ransacked or burned down. I read some of the comments and saw that they stated the Yankee got what he deserved. Now remember this was only from a couple of Southern bloggers. But it&rsquo;s totaaly uncalled for. I wanted vengeance for Channon and Chris, the Henry family, Ann Pressley, and thousands of other Southern victims of black crime. Show some Southern hospitality for Northern Whites please.</p>

<p>&#8220;So what if these flag-wearing students actually DON&rsquo;T like blacks? There&rsquo;s no way blacks, liberal whites, or anyone else can make them! When political correctness shut down most racial public discourse, some blacks complained that it had all just gone beneath the surface and was worse for it. Well, it probably had worsened, since whites had every reason to resent blacks for the shutdown.<br>
Blacks have to earn white people&rsquo;s respect and/or affection just like anyone else would. How obtuse can someone be not to see this?&#8221;</p>
<p>YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!  I never had any real personal feelings about the Confederate Flag (the Stars and Bars being only one of them), but when it became a forbidden symbol, I had to ask why?  The NAACP worked to have it recognized as some &#8220;universal symbol of hate.&#8221;  They then made it along with all the words they could include, forbidden to utter.  This is a demonstration of power, but not only over whites.  It is a demonstration of how once group may exert unconstitutional powers over others via the ignorance or bias of the courts.  </p>
<p>Today, we are seeing the growing results of black rule; whites are targets and not much is being done about it.  I DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO PUT THIS ITEM IN;</p>
<p>Story today on CNN (surprise) concerning hundreds of Midwestern white female children forced into sex slavery right here in the U.S.  The pimps capture them (I don&rsquo;t know how) and force them with death threats to service among others, truck drivers at truck stops!  More truck divers in the U.S. are not white, but clearly, white johns are involved.  The race of the pimps was not disclosed, so we can assume&hellip;.</p>

		<p>53: Courtney, with all due respect, it&rsquo;s mostly liberals who hurl insults at Southern heritage and culture. These liberals can come from any part of the country, including the South (i.e. Southern Poverty Law Center). Most racially aware northerners  sympathize with your plight. The same interracial crime and decay occurs in our communities as well. For years, Southern culture has actually been well-received in the North. (bluegrass music, southern rock, etc). Growing up in the North, I have seen thousands of confederate flags. It was a well-liked symbol, although few really knew much about it.</p>
<p>If you are stuck in a room full of Harvard liberals, Hollywood liberals, British liberals, etc they will all say awful things about the South. That is unfortutlatey a reality. As far as the redneck jokes go, that is insensitive and wrong. The media in general has demonized the South, along with demonizing conservatives, whites, Germans, Christians, Arabs&hellip;the list goes on.  This anti-South prejudice is not a northern issue, but a liberal and leftist issue. It is also a form of racism.</p>

		<p>Anyone who has read this site or Stormfront over a few year period has seen comments from Southerners gloating when Northern whites as beaten, raped or killed by blacks.  The same comments come from Americans when Europeans are attacked by nonwhites.  Another variation of this are comments from people saying that &#8220;things like this don&rsquo;t happen where I live, because we are tough unlike like Yankees/Europeans are.&#8221;  This line of thinking is especially strange because anti-white violence in the South and America is regularly reported here.  </p>
<p>Society at large is a different story, but in the pro-white movement itself, the problems between North and South come from Southerners who have a grudge against other whites.  Pro-white Northerners are pretty much automatically disposed to being pro-Southern unless something happens to change that.  </p>

		<p>Courtney from Alabama, I agree with you.  I&rsquo;m originally from Georgia and have been discriminated against and ridiculed all my life.  Here in Florida, locals ridicule people from outside the cities as &#8220;bass-ackward rednecks&#8221; because they have a southern heritage and don&rsquo;t vote Democrat and sometimes drive a pick-up truck.  In Missouri, where I lived for six years, the state was strangely completely segregated yet very liberal-minded with regard to taxes and how they voted.  </p>
<p>But the worst thing that happened was when I returned to Georgia for a while.  I had a job at a university where I was responsible for assisting doctors with their licensure, aka, postgraduate education.  Many, many, times I would have northern (New York, New Jersey, Maine, Connecticut) doctors try to coerce me into untoward activities with regard to certifications, and when I stated that they and I both had to adhere to the law, I was told I was a stupid, ignorant southerner and they would mock me with a fake southern drawl.  Some would even curse and scream.</p>
<p>Even today, my friends will make fun of my accent when it comes out after a drink or two, as if somehow their leftover Brooklyn or Bronx or Chicago accents are non-existent.</p>
<p>Whatever.  I will always be immensely proud of my Georgian background.  I am a 12th generation American and 7th generation Georgian and no one can take that away from me.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s always amazing to me how much control over our thinking and ideas the media possesses. If we didn&rsquo;t have the messages coming through the media that the Confederate flag was a symbol of slavery and hate, no one would think anything about it. Certainly most of these kids would not care. The media shapes our world view to theirs (the elites). Our schools are not teaching our children to think independently, but rather to accept blindly what they are told. To show how powerful the schools are at shaping children&rsquo;s thinking, I live in Alabama and a little boy who grew up here and is 12 years old came over one day to play with my kids. I was watching a Civil War documentary and he sat with me for a couple of minutes and said, &#8220;Aren&rsquo;t the men in blue the &#8216;good guys&rsquo; because they freed the slaves, and the men in gray the &#8216;bad guys&rsquo;? Even our own Southern schools have bought into the politically correct narrative that the South was evil and the Civil War was fought over slavery. INDOCTRINATION WORKS!!!</p>

		<p>If there have been comments from Southerners as some of you above are pointing out who have cheered about violence against Northerners, that is a shame.  However, all I can say, is all the time that I have been involved with this movement since 2004 posting on all these websites, I haven&rsquo;t seen it in the sense that all of you are speaking of.  I haven&rsquo;t seen it at all actually.</p>
<p>I have noticed, as ATBOTL is saying, that Southerners in this movement show an amount of pride that might irritate whites from elsewhere, but at the same time I have seen more than a couple of comments coming from Northerners that classify Southerners as &#8220;stupid&#8221;, playing on the redneck stereotype (I won&rsquo;t mention any names to be polite).  So if we want to discuss &#8220;who started it&#8221;  I think it will be hard to determine.</p>
<p>Anonymous poster 58: Thanks for the polite post.  I agree with most of what you say unless you are implying that the North is equal to the South in racial awareness.  It most certainly is not. Yes, I know there are racially conscious  Northerners just as there are liberal Southerners, but I am looking at overall trends.  And, unlike what you assume in your post, I don&rsquo;t hang out with Harvard and Hollywood yankees.  Why would I?  I have never even met one.  Unfortunately the white Northerners I mention who have liberal views on race have been people who I thought were conservative&hellip;people that I have met through my church and who were from places like Upstate New York and Wyoming. </p>

		<p>14-WITWM:&#8221;Of course the ones who are still fighting the war who don&rsquo;t like us Northerners can just go learn to read and write..&#8221;</p>
<p>- Arghh!!!!  My apologies to the entire South!  WITWM appears to believe there  is a split among Southerners regarding the Civil War, but should, I believe, come to understand than any such denigrating remarks will be taken as an afront to all.  Hopefully, those who have commented here have provided WITWM with a better understanding.</p>
<p><br>
38-Courtney: &#8220;I have met enough in life who enjoy looking down on the South,..&#8221;</p>
<p>- And there are those who always will, and no doubt they will make themselves known and their words will be widely broadcast, etc.  Otherwise, for the average person you may meet, my guess is that the only thing they know of the South is what they are taught in propaganda class or what they see and hear on comedy shows. Sadly, they do not have the depth of character to see beyond such nonsense.  Otherwise, those who do not look down on the South are more likely to never speak their comments loudly or at all, unless asked, and even if they should do so, their words will never make the media. Such behavior though is learned through a lifetime of indoctrination, and it will take a lot for us to undo such training.</p>
<p><br>
41-QD: &#8220;Remember, these white students wouldn&rsquo;t have come around to our way of thinking but for the diversity shoved in their faces every day..&#8221;</p>
<p>- Agreed.  That is pretty much what it takes - reality to defeat fantasy.  Eventually there will be a separation, but it appears we have a ways to go yet.</p>
<p><br>
44-NBJ: &#8220;so we CAN get over it. And of course we share the same views, although I may be a little more vigorous in mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I find this to be an interesting comment. My question would be: If you share the same views, just what is it that you are getting over?  Otherwise, here again we have a &#8220;South is better than the North&#8221; type comment in that the Southerner (NBJ) is a &#8220;little more vigorous&#8221; than the Northerner. I&rsquo;m not saying that isn&rsquo;t true in this case.  What I&rsquo;m saying is that it appears to me that NBJ is playing to the Southern audience on this website, and in doing so gets in an ever so slight tweak at the North.</p>
<p><br>
51-Fred: &#8220;Northerners who are cautious of blacks themselves take a perverse joy in the racial problems Southerners have faced. Now THAT is what&rsquo;s sick. And that attitude is nearly universal among Northerners.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Only for those who still remain unenlightened by diversity. Even then, for most it is again a learned response from school indoctrination and what we &#8220;learn&#8221; from TV.  I recall no such discussions at home where Southern Whites were denigrated in any way.  In the total absense of any pro-Southern White (or even White in general) teachings, the only thing we have is anti-Southern White indoctrination, and any such lifelong type of learning is extremely difficult to undo or even think against.</p>
<p><br>
52-Keith: &#8220;Thus, as a matter of history, it is the north, and not the South that bears responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Exactly.. the South has no responsibility whatsoever for any race issues. (That was sarcasm.)</p>
<p><br>
52-Keith: &#8220;Finally, many northerners are polite, and midwesterners almost always are nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Thank you for the compliment.</p>
<p>- By the way, I promise to work on my funny accent&hellip; Oh wait! That comment was yet another dig against the North&hellip; and I missed it!.. or not&hellip;</p>
<p><br>
53-Courtney: &#8220;As an aside, I don&rsquo;t agree with the endless comments from Northerners on this website that &ldquo;most of us aren&rsquo;t hostile towards the South&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Being from the North, I would agree that most of us indeed are not hostile to the South.  We do though, remain with the constant indoctrination of the evils of Slavery being solely a domain of the South.  I think it is more apprehension towards the South which comes from a combined anti-South teaching throughout school and the ever greater feelings of White guilt that our fight against the South was less than the best option.  The negative comments you receive are, I believe, more likely a conditioned response which contains a significant amount of the &#8220;I&rsquo;m better than you&#8221; thought process as a sort of defense against knowing the truth, or of not wanting to fully admit it. I think something similar is true of all such comments we see between the two sides.</p>
<p><br>
53-Courtney: &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I am just not convinced that enough Northerners really respect the South.&#8221;</p>
<p>- And many never will. Nor does is seem that enough Southerners really respect the North.  Here we go again&hellip; The South is mad at the North for freeing the Slaves and crushing States rights; The North is mad at the South for enslaving Blacks even though Northerners shipped them in and sold them.  This has no end and no real beginning. There is no way the White world can win within the context of the Country of the United States of America.  If we are going to survive as a race, we will need a whole new game plan.</p>
<p><br>
  As a last comment here, I swear some of the comments we see on this site must be placed by trolls whose efforts are designed to continue the White discourse, thus keeping us from gaining greater ground towards ensuring our continued existence.<br>

<p>Yes, there have been a few comments on this website within the last year (the ones I recall related to the flash mob violence up North). </p>
<p>I also recall being told directly that since I was not born in the South I should not move to a small Southern town as my presence would corrupt the culture. Do you recall who said that?  As a Californian that transplanted to a small Southern town I can say people are VERY friendly (at least to my face!). People are very accepting and polite, even though I am a non-Christian in the Bible Belt. I am not shy when it comes to expressing views on race and my belief in segregation; hearing it from a &#8220;yankee&#8221; no doubt makes my Southern friends feel far less self-conscious about their not so PC views. The only thing I would change about the deep south is the rampant animal abandonment and abuse, but that isn&rsquo;t a yankee thing as all of the animal loving Southerners agree the problemis quite severe.</p>

		<p>Fred, Fred, Fred. You sir, are the poster child for the reason your perceived sleight from Northerners about Southerners exists today. Maybe it&rsquo;s because you live in black neighborhoods, maybe because you like to blame others, (ironically a lot of low class blacks live like that, too) or maybe you have a chip on your shoulder from a war that is almost two hundred years old between people that are no longer alive, for certain goals that are obsolete in this day and age. </p>
<p>All I know is saying it&rsquo;s &#8220;poetic justice&#8221; for yankees to experience savagery and brutality from blacks is a n****r attitude to the fullest. Only an idiot or low IQer would state that. Or someone who can&rsquo;t control what they say without thinking first. I&rsquo;m hoping what you said was out of pure emotion because those impulses can be reigned in and controlled. If you actually enjoy watching Northern Whites as victims at the hands of Sub-Saharans and that thought gains strength south of Columbus, Ohio, and south of, say, St. Louis, Missouri, we as Whites, have no chance of attaining our goals. So thanks for that. You would be succeeding in giving the liberals what they want.</p>

<p>It is called &#8220;shock value&#8221;. Even in Canada whites will use the Confederate flag for that purpose. Either that or some of the students have Southern ancestry, possible vague of course. Either way it is vogue in many rural areas.  </p>
<p>My mother was born in Mississippi but I don&rsquo;t go around flaunting myself as a Southerner. How ever, as the North has no similarly &#8220;exclusionist&#8221; symbol, many rural folk adopt Southern symbolism and claim some detached Southern ancestry. Some even start speaking in full-on stereotypical Southern accents&hellip; even though there is no single &#8220;Southern Accent&#8221;.</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what a &#8220;Yankee&#8221; sounds like either, necessarily.  People tell me I sound like a Brit or something because I have trouble with rhotacisms.</p>
<p>What I hate about things like this is it brings Southerner heritage groups to start cowering and making silly statements about how their flag isn&rsquo;t a &#8220;racist symbol&#8221;.</p>
<p>I hate seeing that, so I have personally started flying the Grand Union Flag (First National Flag)- the 13 r/w strips with an old pattern of the British Union Jack in the canton- since it is both explicitly American and explicitly celebrates the combined Anglo-Saxon/Norman/Celtic heritage that was brought to this land. </p>
<p>I got the idea as I heard of how much the UJ is considered &#8220;offensive&#8221; and &#8220;xenophobic&#8221; over the pond. </p>

		<p>44-NBJ: &ldquo;so we CAN get over it. And of course we share the same views, although I may be a little more vigorous in mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- I find this to be an interesting comment. My question would be: If you share the same views, just what is it that you are getting over? Otherwise, here again we have a &ldquo;South is better than the North&rdquo; type comment in that the Southerner (NBJ) is a &ldquo;little more vigorous&rdquo; than the Northerner. I&rsquo;m not saying that isn&rsquo;t true in this case. What I&rsquo;m saying is that it appears to me that NBJ is playing to the Southern audience on this website, and in doing so gets in an ever so slight tweak at the North.</p>
<p>I was referring to my husband when I said we share the same views&hellip; as in race and how unfair we are treated these days as Whites. When I say I am a little more vigorous in mine, I meant that I&rsquo;m just more likely to go on a rant, and have serious anger issues when I see things like Whites being attacked for no reason. He&rsquo;s always been the calm, cool and collected one, and that&rsquo;s just the way he is, and I seriously doubt it has anything to do with his being from up North. Also, I was referring to my family when I say &#8220;we&#8221; can get over it. And they did. Obviously I don&rsquo;t have an issue with Northerners, as I married one. I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m playing to the Southern posters here either, as I thought I made myself clear when I say we have more serious issues to deal with without White Northern and Southern folk bickering over nonsense. We are in this thing together, and we HAVE to stick together regardless of where we come from.</p>

		<p>Who in their White Mind:  After reading your classless, hateful posts directed at Southerners, something tells me that you have some deep seated hatred for the South. Stop using posts from Fred and other Southerners as examples of &#8220;why there is animosity towards the South&#8221;, when it is obvious that you yourself need to get straightened out.  Why haven&rsquo;t more of your Northern brethren who are so busy lecturing me, called you out yet on this?  To me that is very telling. You obviously hate the South, and you are jumping at any opportunity to show it.  You are part of the problem.</p>
<p>I am not going to fully believe these claims about Southerners cheering for violence against Northerners until I see actual quotes.  Then I can draw my own conclusion as to whether or not something was taken out of context.  </p>
<p>On another note, I really don&rsquo;t think a lot of you are really fully aware of the havoc that the North has wreaked on the South from the Civil War all the way through to the Civil Rights period (and even through to today).  I would think a lot of you would have more understanding as to why so many Southerners are angry to the point that SOMETIMES, SOME of them might let something slip out every now and then that doesn&rsquo;t sound so nice.  If I heard a South African white say something similar about America, I would probably give them some leeway considering the situation that we put them in.</p>
<p>In closing, I am done with this discussion.  I think it has exhausted itself.  It is a shame there is so much division on here, and after a while I lose the energy for this back and forth stuff&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;but I will say the following&hellip;&hellip;.I first started posting on here in 2004.  At that time there weren&rsquo;t very many posters, and John PM was among them. For a few years there was a group of high caliber posters on this website, and there was only one moderator who was very strict about what went through.  </p>
<p>At that time I was very well liked by most people on Amren.  Through the years, more and more people have infiltrated this website, posting many different, diverse views from the norm.  Quite a few of the newcomers over the years haven&rsquo;t liked my strong views, and some of them (again I won&rsquo;t mention names) seem to enjoy commenting on my posts only because they always seem to enjoy having a bone to pick with me.  It has made posting on here less enjoyable. It is for this same reason that John PM (one of the better posters on here) has stopped posting.  He is one of my good friends and we talk all the time.</p>
<p>I might have strong views that certain people don&rsquo;t like, but at least I stick by them and I don&rsquo;t follow certain posters around Amren harrassing them just because I haven&rsquo;t gotten over something they said to me before, as is done to me all the time.  It is borderline harrassment, and it is why many of our old timers are leaving Amren. I don&rsquo;t argue with posters because I have problems with them as people; I argue with them because I don&rsquo;t agree with what they wrote.  There is a difference there. Maybe others should do the same.</p>

<p>Are you serious?  Since 1865, many whites have moved all over the country.  You must not get around very much.</p>
<p>And if you knew your own history, you&rsquo;d know that the CSA allowed wealthy slave owners to forgo military service.  So the serving soldiers were losers on both ends.  When the CSA ordered conscription it proved that central, federal government was a reality and the argument for confederacy was dead.  That left slavery as the only argument, and the vast majority of Southern soldiers had never owned one.  They just responded to an invasion from the North, which was all that was going on by then.</p>
<p>I have ancestors from both sides of the conflict.  I am a distant cousin of Robert E. Lee.  Nothing makes me sadder than to think of that war and all the white people killing one another.  In fact, the two world wars have the same effect on me.  It all really breaks my heart.</p>

<p>to 75-Courtney: You may not have seen my comment at 63, but I believe I called out WITWM, at least to some degree, for his anti-Southern lack of White solidarity.  Also, I hope my comments were not taken as lecturing, as that was not my intent.</p>

		<p>To my Southern and Northern brothers,  any  truly honest American after hearing these 3 names cannot pretend to look down on the Southern states for it was their culture alone that produced the immortal Washington; Jefferson, and Madison.</p>
<p>Charleston SC was the wealthiest city in British north America and its wealth astonished Boston&rsquo;s John Adams when he visited the South. While Bostonians sent their sons to Harvard, the sons of the South were educated at Oxford. In terms od education, land ownership, and aristocratic culture and blue bloodlines the South frequently surpassed (and surpasses) the north.</p>

<p>True, but the point of this story is whites should be free to express themselves and have symbols, regardless if others find it offensive.  If blacks can, so can we.  <br>

<p>- And yet once again, even after all the recriminations on this thread, we have another put down of the North.  It does not matter at this point even if the comments are true, for even if so, it would be true by only a matter of degree and not in an absolute sense.  What are we going to do, have the last two White people on the planet in the year 2525 debate who brought over the first Slave a thousand years earlier? The continued &#8220;We&rsquo;re better than you&#8221; attitude must come to an end if we (Whites worldwide) are to remove ourselves from centuries of internecine conflict, as the verbal onslaught generally leads to physical slaughter in the end. </p>

<p>BannerRWB, I respect you as a poster and I like your civility.  I wasn&rsquo;t talking to you directly above by the way.  I was talking to a lot of people.  </p>
<p>However, it is easy to be the peace maker when you enjoy pointing fingers at the other side.  Wasn&rsquo;t it a Northerner who started this debate with a hate filled post to begin with?  Can I go back and count all the insults towards Southerners above?  I noticed how you overly dissected NBJ&rsquo;s comment above. If what she said was an insult to the North, then I guess Southerners aren&rsquo;t allowed opinions at all in this discussion.  If we are going to examine peoples&rsquo; comments like this, then there are more than a few Northern posters above guilty of making under their breath indirect insults towards the South. Where was the finger pointing towards them?</p>
<p>I agree with you however, that this discussion needs to end.  But why don&rsquo;t we end on the note that BOTH sides here have been antagonizing to each other? Fair enough?</p>

<p>No we do not! Blacks we uncivilized, living in a preliterate, so-called society, and the fact some of them were brought to America made it possible for some to actually learn how to read and write.</p>
