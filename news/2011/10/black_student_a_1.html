			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Mansour, State News, October 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Black Student Alliance, or BSA, met with some of MSU&rsquo;s top administrator&rsquo;s, including MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon on Friday at Brody Hall, determined to see action in response to a series of racial incidents that have occurred on campus this semester.</p>
<p>The group read off a list of 22 demands they want to see implemented by administrators, with each demand containing an expected date of completion.</p>
<p>Included in the list of demands were the establishment of a multicultural center, the creation of a required course for all students teaching cultural sensitivity and an increase in black students, faculty and staff at the university to match the 15.2 percent of blacks in Michigan&rsquo;s population, according to U.S. Census data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tone of the meeting was contentious with members of BSA&rsquo;s executive board frequently raising their voice and interrupting Simon on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>At one point when Simon referred to the demands as &#8220;recommendations,&#8221; BSA Vice President and journalism junior Silver Moore interrupted Simon and responded pointedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep throwing around the word recommendation,&#8221; Moore said at the meeting. &#8220;These are not recommendations or suggestions. If they were suggestions we would put them in a suggestion box. These are demands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simon said the administration would send a written response to the BSA&rsquo;s demands &#8220;in due course,&#8221; and said the university has to continue to improve graduation rates and health and safety issues among other concerns.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Simon also said she was disappointed with the way the meeting played out.</p>

<p>Were Black girls kidnapped, raped, tortored and killed by Whites?</p>
<p>Did gangs of Whites attack lone Black men or women walking across campus late at night,while yelling racila slurs?</p>
<p>Did gangs of White youths flash-mob local stores, stealing and destroying everything?</p>
<p>Where Whites with low grades or SAT scores admitted into the university over higher-scoring Blacks?</p>
<p>Where Whites given special tutoring, set-asides, lounges, fellowships, scholorships, or other privliges not given to Blacks?</p>
<p>What happened that elicited this response?</p>

		<p>I bet I could compile a list of &#8220;racial incidents&#8221; that has occurred on that campus in the last year, too. I bet my list would be different, and longer, than the one the black student group came up with. </p>

Hmmm&hellip; no mention of what the racial incidents were, and which race of people. From the comments section, I gather blacks are having issues with&hellip; Asians? Now, what was UVa-Wise saying about our &#8220;ignorant&#8221; viewpoint on diversity?</p>

		<p>The ethno-centric breakup of the U.S. cannot come soon enough.  Once the U.S. is destroyed and the land mass is again redivided, Blacks can have their own schools in their own nation. They can then teach themselves whatever they want and give themselves all A&rsquo;s.  Somehow though, I just don&rsquo;t think they will offer &#8220;cultural sensitivity&#8221; classes to their own people.</p>

		<p>Lol&hellip;.the blacks were making a similar pain in the butt of themselves 20 years ago when I attended MSU.  Back then, they couldn&rsquo;t seem to come up with anything specific (yesh&hellip;we&rsquo;s wanteshes teh moar diversity, now).  They would take over buildings, moan but never come right out and say what it was that was such a problem.  We want the administration to address &#8220;racism&#8221;&hellip;.well, ummm, what do you mean&hellip;.what racist behaviors do you want changed?  Yeah&hellip;.umm, we&rsquo;ll have to get back to you on that.</p>
<p>Now, it seems they at least have 22 concrete demands, which, are, of course, completely unreasonable but at least identifiable.  Pass more black students (what, just do away with their failing grades).  Make everyone attend white guilt brainwashing classes&hellip;.yeah&hellip;.I&rsquo;m sure the student body will appreciate that.</p>
<p>And rather than, ask, they are &#8220;demanding&#8221;&hellip;.well&hellip;.or else what?  Quite frankly, such talk is reason to expel every single person involved.  And shoot anyone who does more than talk.</p>
<p>Because, after 20 years of listening to these fools with sympathy and open mindedness, they&rsquo;ve yet to address anything serious.  And quite frankly, the whites at MSU could care less about the blacks.  The blacks are there to play ball and take fake classes for a phony degree they won&rsquo;t ever get hired with.  Everyone knows it, including them.</p>

		<p>The voters of Michigan, whose tax money subsidizes Michigan State University, should demand a retroactive end to affirmative action, one that would result in the immediate expelling of every student who got in under an affirmative action policy. That would end this problem immediately. </p>

This is the real problem at Michigan State University, not some so called &#8220;racial incidents.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
An 18-year-old female student allegedly was sexually assaulted between 10:30-11:40 p.m. Saturday in the men&rsquo;s restroom at Armstrong Hall, according to a crime alert by MSU Police&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Police announced Sunday morning that they have identified a suspect described as an 18-year-old black male with short black hair, weighing 160 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches tall.</p>

		<p>More blacks wanting more things without cause or merit.  I see the percentage of whites weren&rsquo;t released in the state in regards to in the University.</p>
<p>I have lived in MI for about 20 years now.  I has to be 80%+ white, easily.  MSU is about 65%, give or take.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair.</p>
<p>This is no different then the Silicon Valley article.</p>
<p>Blacks want more.  Blacks want to be around whites.  Blacks want everything, but can&rsquo;t earn anything.  It must be because their great, great, great, great, great grandfather was a slave. </p>

<p>I went to the original article but there was no mention of what these racial incidents were. One has to wonder who committed these racial incidents.</p>
<p>BTW, while I was at the original article, I found saw another article:</p>
<p><b>Sexual assault reported in Armstrong Hall</b></p>
<p><i>Police announced Sunday morning that they have identified a suspect described as an 18-year-old black male with short black hair, weighing 160 pounds and 5 feet, 11 inches tall.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/43f2wmh" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/43f2wmh</a></p>
<p>I wonder if this was a racially motivated incident.</p>

<p><i>Included in the list of demands were the establishment of a multicultural center</i> </p>
<p>Oh, no biggie there. Just the construction of a new building at the cost of probably a million dollars or so. And I&rsquo;m sure much wrangling over whether enough black contractors are hired.</p>
<p><i> the creation of a required course for all students teaching cultural sensitivity and an increase in black students </i> </p>
<p>Right. Indoctrination of all the students in order to please less than 15% of the students.</p>
<p>The sad thing is I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll get all their demands.</p>

This is the kind of uppity attitude blacks display after they have had an unending fountain of unearned praise and empowerment heaped on them by silly liberals, many in the education scam.

		<p>I was a student in college during the mid to late 1980s. This was a time of many racist incidents on campus. I had to deal with at least one racist incident per month. During my freshman year, I was constantly being harrassed by the White jocks in my dorm. </p>
<p>I finally moved off campus. On night during my junior year I was walking to m car to go to my off campus apartment when I was suddenly follwed by four White guys making racial comments. Two of the guys were at least 6&rsquo;0 feet and at least 50 lbs heavier than me.</p>
<p>I was by myself, so I decided to quicken my pace without running. I was afraid that they were going to turn violent. When they saw me arrive at my car, they retreated and went the other way. My heart was racing so fast, I thought that I was going to have a heart attack.   </p>
<p>There were also a number of racist comments made in class by students and in some cases, faculty. This was an ongoing fact of life at the time. I felt like I was always being scrutinized by someone. I am sure that many fellow Black students had similar stories as well. It was alo the era of Ronalad Reagan. A president who was vehemently hostile toward African Americans and other minorities.  </p>
<p>I am glad these students have decided to make their concerns knows. Sadly, it seems that more than quarter of a century later with a Black man as president, things still have not changed all that much. </p>

		<p>From the <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~bsaemail/" rel="nofollow">website</a> of the Michigan State University Black Student Alliance:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Black student, you are already part of the BSA family!&#8221;  There&rsquo;s a word for making generalized statements about a person based on their ethnicity, but I can&rsquo;t remember what that word is right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;History gives evidence to the either inherent or created differences between White and Black cultures [&hellip;]&#8221; It&rsquo;s right on the tip of my tongue, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a word that conveys the idea that there are inherent differences between White and Black cultures.  Hopefully some AmRen reader can help me out.  What&rsquo;s that word?  I forget.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through our collective efforts we [&hellip;] may grow and flourish in the world as self-determined critical-thinkers.&#8221; Raising your voice and interrupting are good ways to demonstrate one&rsquo;s critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ervin Armstrong presented the idea of Black Culture rooms in order to help Black students establish their cultural niche in Michigan State&rsquo;s environment, a predominately White institution.  [&hellip;] Currently, there 19 caucus rooms throughout the residence hall system. [&hellip;] Since the 1980&rsquo;s, these caucus rooms are still used by African American students residing in the halls to conduct caucus meetings, hold small-scale programs, and serve as a place where students can study.&#8221;  Clearly 19 rooms for African Americans in use since 1969 are not enough - there needs to be a new multicultural center too.  That can go with the black cheerleading squad and the black newspaper.  Because nothing says integration like self-segregation.</p>
<p>But hang on a sec there, I see on the Michigan State University Black Student Alliance <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~bsaemail/about.htm" rel="nofollow">About</a> page that MSU has had a multicultural center since 1999.  Yep, the MCC has <a href="https://mcc.msu.edu/" rel="nofollow">its own page</a> even.  Took me a dozen keystrokes and a few seconds to find it.  So perhaps the original report is misinformed about what the critical thinkers are seeking.  Or perhaps the critical thinkers aren&rsquo;t thinking to clearly.</p>
<p>&hellip; now if I could just remember what that words was&hellip;</p>

		<p>A big problem in getting a true understanding about race is the illogical approach that Blacks are allowed to use in presenting their case.  They pick and choose when they want to use race.</p>
<p>Either you A.) Take race into consideration, or you B.) Leave it totally out of consideration.</p>
<p>A.) Take race into consideration: Michigan State University was created by White people for White people.  It is maintained by White people.  The university is a totally White enterprise.  Blacks are complete outsiders.  Therefore Blacks have no standing as Blacks.  </p>
<p>B.) Leave race totally out of consideration:  All discussions involving race are off limits.  Therefore Blacks have no standing as Blacks.<br>

		<p>One of the comments on the original news article:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the demands are reasonable. I don&rsquo;t know how MSU students will receive the idea of taking a course on racial sensitivity, but perhaps it could be a part of freshman orientation. Something needs to be done. I have been the victim of discrimination on the campus of MSU, and believe it has to do with the fact that the majority of students have a malformed idea of who black people are. They think that what&rsquo;s shown on tv is an accurate representation of us and this is not the case. I&rsquo;m hoping that the administration responds and that BSA continues to fight for justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right - what&rsquo;s shown on TV isn&rsquo;t an accurate representation of Black people while they are consistently shown as being more moral and better behaved than Whites and other races.  However, what is shown on the news about Black people is very accurate.</p>

		<p>The article says the BSA&rsquo;s &#8220;demands&#8221; are in response to some &#8220;racial incidents&#8221; at MSU. However, the only &#8220;racial incidents&#8221; I could find for MSU were committed anonymously, ie. graffiti, etc. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if one of BSA&rsquo;s members wrote it themselves. Many of these incidents on college campuses turn out to be perpetrated by the alleged victims themselves for the sole purpose of making &#8220;demands&#8221;.</p>

<p>So the &#8220;meeting&#8221; was &#8220;heated&#8221;, was it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed in many news reports about such &#8220;meetings&#8221; with disgruntled Blacktivists a lot of euphemisms like &#8220;heated&#8221; or &#8220;passionate&#8221; or &#8220;emotional.&#8221; This is the lamestream media&rsquo;s attempt to make their white readers believe that the blacks were merely engaging in traditional white-style debate   &mdash;   albeit a debate with a bit more &#8220;soul&#8221; than usual. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that, in every case including this one, what weasel-words like &#8220;heated&#8221; and &#8220;emotional&#8221; really mean is: </p>
<p>&#8220;Angry, low-IQ black radicals, unable to score points with intellect and/or strong arguments, instead resorted to screaming, yelling, crying, threatening, and bullying. Their weak white liberal counterparts, being susceptible to such minority guilt-trips, were sufficiently terrified for their safety, and so caved in to every one of the radicals&rsquo; demands, regardless of how unreasonable or unrealistic.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The alleged racial incidents were a couple incidents of alleged racist graffiti, one sexually explicit drawing and black students allegedly finding a doll made of black rags hanging from a noose in a lab.</p>
<p>Normally the press makes quite a bit of hay out of those types of allegations until it is determined they were perpetrated by blacks in an effort to further their permanent &#8216;victim&rsquo; status.</p>
<p>Members of the BSA were shouting down those folks trying to respond to this ridiculous garbage? A typical tactic used by blacks. I have coined the behavior &#8216;Shaniqua Theater&rsquo; after spending most of my adult life dealing with it as a police officer.</p>

The voters of Michigan, whose tax money subsidizes Michigan State University, should demand a retroactive end to affirmative action, one that would result in the immediate expelling of every student who got in under an affirmative action policy. That would end this problem immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already happened John.  Michigan passed an anti affirmative action initiative.  There was a collge admissions court case, Gutter case.</p>
<p>Neither mattered.  Blatant discrimination against Whites continued. University administrators refused to comply with the anti affirmative action law.<br>

I was a student in college during the mid to late 1980s. This was a time of many racist incidents on campus. I had to deal with at least one racist incident per month. During my freshman year, I was constantly being harrassed by the White jocks in my dorm.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe a word of what you say I am not surprised. If you were in college in the 1980&rsquo;s it was blacks abusing the Whites, not the other way around.  Until the 1980&rsquo;s it was always non student black predators raping White college students.  It was in the 1980&rsquo;s that the black students began raping the White students. </p>
<p>I remember when I was at oh so politically correct Cornell.  <br>
When the first affirmative action blacks arrived at Cornell around 1973 the blacks were put into the big dorms.</p>
<p>The black girls complained that they felt &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; being around so many Jewish girls.  Most of the blacks and Jews were from New York City and the blacks had a major chip on their shoulders.  </p>
<p>During the 1960&rsquo;s New York blacks blamed the destruction of their neighborhoods on Jewish landlords and retail merchants. Although the Jewish leadership was ultra liberal, thousands of Jews a year were robbed, murdered, beaten and raped by the conquering blacks invading their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Remember the 1964 Los Angeles riots was blamed on Jewish merchants.  The 1992 Los Angeles riots were blamed half on evil White police officers and half on Korean merchants.</p>
<p>So the university gave some of those big old houses to the black sororities. White sororities have to buy their houses, but the blacks were given the buildings on very cheap long term leases.</p>
<p>The blacks began spreading the word that there was an active klux chapter on campus and that they were raping and attacking blacks.  There was of course no evidence of this whatsoever.</p>
<p>Then one night a fire broke out on the porch of one of those black sorority houses.  The evil White boys of the klux were blamed.  The blacks rioted across the campus.</p>
<p>The fire of course was set by the blacks themselves.</p>
<p>That is why I don&rsquo;t believe you I Am Not Surprised.</p>
<p>I know how blacks, asians, hispanics, SPLC ADL and other minorities and anti White racists such as SPLC ADL operate. They create incidents and blame them on mysterious Whites who never show up in the surviellance tapes. Remember the numerous noose and hate crime hoaxes where the blacks themselves were caught on tape stringing nooses and spraying graffiti?</p>
<p>Feminazi vs her beloved blacks.  I love it.</p>
<p>Of course this may be a pre arranged set up by the administration and the blacks.</p>
<p>This happened at the university where I worked re the establishment of a chicano studies department. MECHA funded by  some liberal foundation pushed for a chicano studies department.<br>
Administration could not find the money.</p>
<p>One day a mob of non student hispanics invaded the campus and swarmed the faculty club at lunch time.  More than 100,000 dollars worth of damage was done.  Robberies went on all over campus, especially in the faculty club and administration buildings.  The women who were in the faculty club had their purses stolen. Since university women are anti White racists dedicated to our extermination I didn&rsquo;t feel a bit sorry for them.</p>
<p>2 days later the administration found the money and a chicano studies department was created. It was a safe haven for all the affirmative action hispanics who had been admitted to engineering, pre med, programming and other science and tech courses.</p>
<p>Instead of flunking out, they and all the others who were on the verge of flunking out transferred to hispanic studies.  That department pays dozens of anti White racist hispanics to brainwash students that Whites must be exterminated.</p>
<p>For years before Rome totally destroyed Carthage, a Senator Cato preached that Carthage must be destroyed.  Carthage was a major<br>
rival to Rome.  Rome had part of Europe.  Carthage controlled<br>
N. Africa.  It was as powerful as Rome militarily and even more powerful in trade and finance.</p>
<p>Carthage was finally destroyed.  The adults and teens were all slain, the children sold as slaves, the city and surrounding area<br>
razed to the ground.</p>
<p>Before Carthage was destroyed, the Roman senate preached the destruction of Carthage.  Now it is the universities funded by White tax payers, students and MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF ALL, RICH WHITE DONORS!!!!! who preach that Whites must be destroyed.</p>
<p>Even ADL AJC SPLC NOW CPUSA LARAZA NBP NOI do not consistently preach day after day, year after year to now a third generation of students that Whites must be destroyed.</p>
<p>But the colleges and universities do.  What other people pay $200,000 to be told to destroy themselves.  What other people fund the very institutions that preach their destruction.</p>
<p>Carthage at least resisted Rome.  We American Whites do it to ourselves.</p>

<p>I finally moved off campus. On night during my junior year I was walking to m car to go to my off campus apartment when I was suddenly follwed by four White guys making racial comments. Two of the guys were at least 6&rsquo;0 feet and at least 50 lbs heavier than me.</p>
<p>I was by myself, so I decided to quicken my pace without running. I was afraid that they were going to turn violent. When they saw me arrive at my car, they retreated and went the other way. My heart was racing so fast, I thought that I was going to have a heart attack. </p>
<p>There were also a number of racist comments made in class by students and in some cases, faculty. This was an ongoing fact of life at the time. I felt like I was always being scrutinized by someone. I am sure that many fellow Black students had similar stories as well. It was alo the era of Ronalad Reagan. A president who was vehemently hostile toward African Americans and other minorities. </p>
<p>I am glad these students have decided to make their concerns knows. Sadly, it seems that more than quarter of a century later with a Black man as president, things still have not changed all that much. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
I Am Not Surprised:</p>
<p>While the late night incident which was admittedly probably scary (and the other problems you encountered in the dorm) were bad as well. Given the fact that I am probably about your age, maybe a few years older, I am 46, I am aware of soem of the racial incidents that took place on college campuses at the time. However, at my institution, the administration qucikly expelled or disciplined any anyone involved in such behavior. </p>
<p>That being said, the fact is that jerks are jerks regardless of race. It is not only White people or White men who behave in this manner. Moreover, do you really believe that because Ronald Reagan was president during this time was the reason that racial incidents college campuses occured? I know that the late president was not popular among many Blacks, but you might want to rethink this.    <br>

		<p>Students who go to MSU have a VERY accurate idea of what black people are like.  Located in East Lansing, it is only a couple quick miles to greater Lansing, a black, crack infested hell hole.  There is not a single student who goes to MSU that doesn&rsquo;t get a thorough education about what blacks are really like.</p>
<p>As far as racism on campus&hellip;.those are bald faced lies.  Michigan is a liberal bastion, and whites simply do not engage in that behavior.  I have NEVER seen such behavior but I have seen hundreds and hundreds of incidents FROM blacks, of such behavior.</p>
<p>What is happening here is black entitlement&hellip;.not just for things they have not earned but to engage in behaviors that is not appropriate.  Typical is a black man who makes advances on a white woman who wants nothing to do with him&hellip;.then tries to rape her.  When arrested by the cops, to them, it&rsquo;s racism.  Never mind the fact that such has been a capital crime (ie death penalty) for all of human history until the present.</p>
<p>Black claims of &#8220;racism&#8221; and conflict are simply not credible.  They lack even a grain of truth.</p>

<p>The fact is that there were a number of racial incidents that took place on college campuses during the 1980s. both liberal and conservative newspapers The New yorktimes, TheWal Street Journal, National Review, The Progressive etc&hellip; ran stories covering such incidents. </p>
<p>As to whether &#8220;I Am Not Surprised&#8221; is being truthful, I do not know, however, I am more inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt given the time period he is discussing. </p>
<p>These incidents did indeed take place.<br>

<p>Where was this?  In California, all locations, it was the opposite.  My wife&rsquo;s high school was actually invaded one day, by black gangs that beat up every white kid they could catch. The school was already fenced in, and they just plucked them off the chain link fences as they tried to escape, and stomped them.  My wife as a student, had an ongoing problem with one black male who kept breaking into her locker and leaving &#8220;things&#8221; to let her know that he was watching her. She had to leave her books in the principles office for fear they would be stolen, but the school staff would do nothing more.  Her parents finally withdrew her and placed her in a private school.  This was actually the late &rsquo;70s.  I graduated in 1970 in Sacramento County.  We already had sexual harassment of white girls and beat downs of white boys (always by a group) until we had full fledged riots in 1971 (during which blacks ended up hiding in their homes). </p>

If you had been white, and they had been black there is a good chance they would have beaten you up, and stolen your wallet and car.<br>

A black person walking in a white neighborhood after dark may have his feelings hurt. He is unlikely to be the victim of a crime. A white person walking in a black neighborhood after dark risks his life. So does a black person walking in a black neighborhood after dark. </p>

<p>You should also be aware that AMREN has also posted a link in its archives entitled &#8220;Misbehaving White People.&#8221; The link describes some of our fellow Whites who have behaved inappropriately, theft, lying, cover ups and staging hoaxes for some.</p>
<p>I have to be candid here. Some other posters have made this point as well. Just because you disagree or have doubts about someone or something does not mean the situation at hand or the story is false!</p>

As some posters have stated, given the climate in our nation at the time, coupled with well documented in major newspapers about such events taking place, there is a strong possibility that &#8220;I Am Not Surprised&#8221; story is indeed accurate.</p>
<p><br>
Some of you need to get over the &#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe you, I believe what I want to believe, therefore your story is false&#8221; attitude. Such a myopic mindset leaves much to be desired.</p>

		<p>I cannot beleive that some of you posters cannot beleive that there were NEVER any Black or other non-White students ever harrassed by White students on college campuses. I would make the same case if there wee Blacks and other Non-Whites who argued that there were NEVER any Whites who were the victims of campus harrasment by non-Whites. </p>
<p>This defies logic. Posters 47 ad 48 make some very good points.</p>
