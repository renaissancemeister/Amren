<h1>Muslims Say Crosses at Catholic University Violate &#8220;Human Rights&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox New Radio, October 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Washington, D.C. Office of Human Rights confirmed that it is investigating allegations that Catholic University violated the human rights of Muslim students by not allowing them to form a Muslim student group and by not providing them rooms without Christian symbols for their daily prayers.</p>
<p>The investigation alleges that Muslim students &#8220;must perform their prayers surrounded by symbols of Catholicism  &mdash;  e.g., a wooden crucifix, paintings of Jesus, pictures of priests and theologians which many Muslim students find inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Office of Human Rights told Fox News they had received a 60-page complaint against the private university. {snip}</p>
<p>The complaint was filed by John Banzhaf, an attorney and professor at George Washington University Law School. Banzhaf has been involved in previous litigation against the school involving the same-sex residence halls. He also alleged in his complaint involving Muslim students that women at the university were being discriminated against. {snip}</p>
<p>Banzhaf said some Muslim students were particularly offended because they had to meditate in the school&rsquo;s chapels &#8220;and at the cathedral that looms over the entire campus  &mdash;  the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult somewhere on the campus for the university to set aside a small room where Muslims can pray without having to stare up and be looked down upon by a cross of Jesus,&#8221; he told Fox News.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a 2010 interview with National Public Radio, university president John Garvey acknowledged that they don&rsquo;t set aside prayer rooms for Muslim students.</p>
<p>&#8220;We make classrooms available, or our chapels are places where they can pray,&#8221; he told NPR. &#8220;We don&rsquo;t offer Halal meat, although there are always meals that conform to Halal regulations, that allow students to do what they want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Banzhaf said that it is technically not illegal for Catholic University to refuse to provide rooms devoid of religious icons.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be illegal, but it suggests they are acting improperly and probably with malice,&#8221; he said. {snip}</p>
<p>As for the creation of a Muslim student group, Banzhaf said the university has an association of Jewish students  &mdash;  so why not a Muslim group?</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they are entitled as a matter of law to be able to form a Muslim student association and to have the same privileges as associations,&#8221; he said. {snip}</p>
<p>Garvey, in his 2010 interview with NPR, addressed that issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just not something that we view as an activity that we want to sponsor because we&rsquo;re a Catholic institution rather than Muslim,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>The university is Catholic, and is allowed to make its own rules regarding other religions. Those who are offended by the Catholic rules can choose a secular university. The government should not mediate or prosecute in this case.</p>

		<p>What are apparently devout muslims doing at Catholic University in the first place? Are these people stupid or what? How much more of a warning do they need that it might not be the best place for muslims to enroll. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not even sure what Jews are doing at Catholic University but I suspect they are there for the education and are at least  tolerant/understanding of the religious aspects of the school. Muslims show no such tolerance.</p>
<p>And since Amren readers often do this, let&rsquo;s turn things around. Can you imagine Catholic students at a muslim school in the middle east demanding that the mosques and koran be removed so crosses could be put up? </p>
<p>Can you say &#8220;beheading?&#8221;</p>

<p>I suggest that if they find the religious atmosphere in a Catholic school &#8220;inappropriate&#8221; or &#8220;offensive&#8221; that they should find themselves another, more accommodating school to attend. Better yet, go back to a Muslim country, where they can pray without Catholic symbols offending them, and where WE won&rsquo;t be offended by THEM. I am not a Catholic, but I wouldn&rsquo;t presume to go into a Catholic school, then demand that they accommodate me by removing their icons and rearranging everything to suit my lack of faith. (But then again, I am white, and somewhat civilized&hellip;)</p>

What the school should do is simply say something like, &#8216;this is a Catholic school with all that entails. Anyone who applies to this Catholic school is aware it is a Catholic school and they will be surrounded by Catholic and Christian iconography. Anyone who objects to Catholic and Christian symbols is free to find a non-Catholic school which will serve their needs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>No anger. No hostility. Just state the facts. All it takes is conviction and a backbone. </p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s likely the school will accommodate Muslims and give them what they demand lest they be call &#8216;intolerant&rsquo; (which is exactly what the Muslim students are).<br>

		<p>Typical Marxist trick of &#8220;critical theory&#8221;.</p>
<p>Make Whiteys start doubting the value of our uniqueness.</p>
<p>Claim that you are offended by the culture of those who oppress you, and sure enough, as long as that culture is Whitey, they will surrender up whatever you demand.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how White Humanity has gotten itself into such a suicidal state- surrender, surrender, surrender to the blacks, Mexicans, and Muslims.   </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t deserve to keep anything at all, given how little we value what we do have as soon as our lessers come around making demands of us.</p>
<p>Whites put an end to White Supremacy, thus, Whites deserve nothing but Heaven&rsquo;s contempt and the burden of slavery.</p>

		<p>To all that say let them go somewhere else&hellip;..RIGHT ON, I would add, what are they doing there in the first place, it is a Catholic school, is there a law now that they have to admit non Catholics. I guess I am showing my age (I&rsquo;m 50) but in my day in the 60s and 70s (not that long ago in the great scheme of things) only CATHOLICS could get admitted to CATHOLIC schools, this being grammar schools, High schools and colleges. Lets say admitted members of the Church Of Satan want to go, do they Oh Okay ? If it is a religious institution than it should be open to ONLY those of that religious faith plain and simple. I doubt very much that Muslims they would try to get in to yeshivas. This sort of nonsense cuts all across our social spectrum IE, ONE lesbian goes to E-harmony.com and sees only straight women and sues and sues successfully because there are no lesbians for her on that site, AND like the Muslims ( although they&rsquo;re more than one in the instance) they get away with it, and they&rsquo;re most likely to get their way here as well, and that&rsquo;s the most disturbing and troubling thing of all.   </p>

		<p>The other side of the coin is this:<br>
Why did a catholic university admit muslim students in the first place?<br>
At the very least muslim students could have signed a declaration recognising the catholic university&rsquo;s ethos as a condition before entry.<br>
 Unfortunately, the catholic university is very prepared to accept muslims if they pay fees - and not so prepared to accept catholics who can&rsquo;t pay fees.<br>

		<p>If I were to attend BYU, I have to follow along with the codes and rules in place. Should I wish to smoke, drink coffee, or do some other things, I should probably go to Utah Valley University or another state supported college. The professors may be Mormon, but they cannot impose their religious beliefs on me. Over in the Middle East, things stop or slow down for daily prayers. There is a Mosque on the Kuwait Naval Base and you hear the calls to prayer at some ridiculous hours. Christians are not very well &#8220;accommodated&#8221; in that part of the world. How about starting your own Universities? </p>

		<p>No one is forcing Muslims to attend a Catholic University. If they don&rsquo;t like the fact that crosses are displayed, then they can transfer to another school.</p>
<p> Muslims, along with the leftist D.C. Office of Human Rights, are fully aware they have the option to attend secular schools. They chose a Catholic school with the intention of making complaints and dismantling  it from within. The fact that crosses are displayed was not the deterrent, but the very thing that drew them all together to this game.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As for the creation of a Muslim student group, Banzhaf said the university has an association of Jewish students – so why not a Muslim group?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tut, tut. Apparently Prof. Banzhaf doesn&rsquo;t understand that some minorities are more equal than others.</p>
<p>And, I apologize for the ignorance of this question, but do Jews pray?</p>
<p>If they do, then how do they manage to pray among all the crosses but the muslims can&rsquo;t?</p>

		<p>I believe that most complaints of discrimination against Moslems are part of an organized effort to break down all barriers to an eventual U.S. subservience to Islam.  There are constant reports of Moslems doing even outrageous things to create a stir and then crying foul  &mdash;  such as boarding an airplane and doing everything to convince the flight staff that terrorism is afoot.  They no doubt hope that lawsuits will make airlines and other companies afraid to challenge anything they do.  <br>
As long as Eric Holder is AG, there will be no relief from tolerance for these actions.  It&rsquo;s of paramount importance that we get him and his boss out of office next year.</p>

		<p>This is nothing but another incremental step towards a Muslim stranglehold on everything. They are anti-white, anti-western civilization, anti-freedom of religion (for everybody except themselves), and anti-everything non-Muslim controlled. I would think that the Catholic Church would have enough attorneys to think up the bright idea that since the CATHOLIC UNIVERSITY is privately owned by the CATHOLIC CHURCH maybe they have the right to have CATHOLIC SYMBOLS in their own places of study and worship? Why do Muslims want to go to a Catholic University anyway? Didn&rsquo;t they notice it was owned by a Christian religion somewhere along the enrollment and acceptance process? </p>

		<p>&ldquo;It may not be illegal, but it suggests they are acting improperly and probably with malice,&rdquo; he said. </p>
<p>What is improper about a Christian church having Christian symbols? What is malicious about it? How does this violate their human rights? If a person doesn&rsquo;t believe in something, it has no power over them. If I don&rsquo;t believe in UFO&rsquo;s for instance, pictures of UFO&rsquo;s on the walls won&rsquo;t bother me&hellip; If they really don&rsquo;t believe in Christianity, Christian pictures shouldn&rsquo;t affect them in any way. They need to get a grip and stop being so sensitive. They hold a way of life that is incompatible with American tradition, culture and belief, so they need to be deported elsewhere.</p>

		<p>When one considers the daily tribulations that Christians in Muslim countries are subjected to, it is stunning to read of the temerity of this guy Banzhaf. I rubbed my eyes, checked my reading glasses three times, and still I wonder if this guy is mentally ill, or am I suppose to suspend disbelief at his ridiculous proposal. To even imagine something similar happening in Egypt or Iraq, or anyplace else in the middle east where Christians still exist is almost in the realm of science fiction. <br>

		<p>The likeness of Christ on the Cross is something that they hate. Too bad. You&rsquo;re in our house, now.</p>
<p>Jesus was scourged in the worst possible ways, beaten, spat on, cursed, tormented, and then nailed to a Cross to die over a period of three hours, for us. HIS &#8220;Human Rights&#8221; were violated in ways we cannot even begin to imagine, all for us.</p>
<p>If the Muslims find the Cross, and the likeness of Christ upon it so offensive, then they can take their selves off of the Catholic Campuses, and start their own Colleges. </p>
<p>I will call the Catholic Colleges, and speak to their Administrators, and demand that they stand firm in the faith, and tell these Cultist anti-Christs to find somewhere else to go. Maybe someplace really hot. </p>

		<p>I belong to the Maronite Catholic Church which is based in Lebanon. From what I understand, Muslims have been attending Catholic/Christian schools &amp; universities there for decades without incident, even during the 1975-90 Lebanese civil war.<br>
I think its ironic that they would make such demands on Catholic University of America, but then again their ultimate goal is to drive Christianity out of its birthplace, the Near East. Look at the horrible treatment Coptic Christians have received in Egypt, the slaughter of Chaldean Catholics in Iraq since GW 2 &amp; what the Armeneans have endured during the past century to get an idea of their overall agenda. I hope the Catholic Church doesn&rsquo;t capitulate to these &#8220;radicals&#8221; because it could spill over into other areas of American Christianity. That would be the death knoll of all who uphold our nation&rsquo;s tradition of religous freedom. </p>

		<p>A point to  be made is that the university is already granting them a concession by generously giving them a place to hold their prayer sessions   &mdash;     which the university DOESN&rsquo;T EVEN HAVE TO DO.  This does not pretend to be a secular or state institution.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those concessions are not enough!  The Moslems demand more. And then how much more will there be after that?</p>
<p>This illustrates very well that the notions of &#8220;Rights&#8221; and &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; are Western concepts that are utterly foreign to this alien mentality. There is no way to integrate them or accommodate with them, because no matter how much they get, they will always want more   &mdash;   until they have it all.</p>

		<p>I find it hard to believe that a faithful Muslim would even want to go to a Catholic University? What could be their objective?  To show peace and tolerance?  Doubtful.  They need to see why we believe Jesus was God on Earth? Na, they think he was just a prophet..  So why?  Maybe to infiltrate and try to convert, maybe, looking for a good place to bomb?  Hopefully not.  </p>

		<p>For all of you wondering what Muslims are doing at a Catholic school&hellip;well&hellip;they&rsquo;re there because it IS a Catholic school. It&rsquo;s the same reason they send their women to work at major corporations (deep pockets) and then bring suit against the company for violating their &ldquo;religious freedoms&rdquo; when  not allow them to wear their hijab while waiting on tables or selling tickets at Disneyland. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re intent on destroying our country and those institutions by interjecting their disgusting Islam into the very fabric of our being. They are using our own Constitution against us to wage their &#8220;holy war&#8221; against us.<br>

<p>That is because the Jews of this country have a nation wide Jewish student organization, Hillel. There are others such as Chabad. There are branches of Hillel in most of the Catholic colleges.  The muslims are perfectly free to do what the Jews did.  Pay some rabbis and organizers to establish branches in universities.  Rent, buy or build a building.  Hold services and events to draw the students in.</p>
<p>There are Catholic organizations such as the Newman clubs at all non Catholic universities.  The Newman clubs did what the Jewish Hillel clubs did.  They built their own organization and found their own space.</p>
<p>In the military sometimes non Christians put an attractive drape over the crosses when they have services.</p>
<p>One of the major industries in this country is the cultivation of grievances.</p>
