			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gavin Allen, Daily Mail (London), October 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A father-of-three was beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of as many as 15 thugs who stole his wedding ring and mobile phone. </p>
<p>Joseph Frederic, 38, was punched to the ground before the gang repeatedly kicked him and stamped on his head.</p>
<p>Mr Frederic, who was visiting from France, had attended a family friend&rsquo;s birthday party near the Centaur Social Club in Langley Green, Crawley.</p>
<p>The social club had not hosted the party, but at around 2am Mr Frederic went outside to look for his wife and was set upon by the gang in the club&rsquo;s car park. </p>
<p>After the attack the gang fled and a local resident said the gang had a taxi waiting for them. </p>
<p>Mr Joseph, who is French Mauritian, was taken to the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead for surgery to repair a series of facial fractures.</p>
<p>Because of the extent of his injuries he was not allowed to fly home and instead had to return by Eurostar.</p>
<p>He is recovering well from the attack and is now able to speak and eat again as his horrific facial swelling begins to recede.  </p>
<p>Mr Frederic&rsquo;s friend Sylvio Lynx, 57, said the attack took place around 40 minutes after his son&rsquo;s 18th birthday party had ended on Sunday, October 16.</p>
<p>&#8216;He went outside because he was looking for his wife,&rsquo; said Mr Lynx. </p>
<p>&#8216;They took his ring, his necklace and his phone. He could not see the attackers because it was dark. He cannot describe the faces of those who did it.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The only description Mr Frederic was able to offer police is that he believes all the attackers were black.</p>
<p>Detective Constable Mike George said: &#8216;This was an attack on a man visiting this country. </p>
<p>&#8216;The consultant treating him described his injuries as some of the worst she had seen from an assault.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>This is why the focus on Muslims only is misguided.  Blacks are a large and rapidly growing part of Europe&rsquo;s immigration problem. In London, blacks cause far more problems than Muslims.  </p>

		<p>In 1975 I visited London with my brother as a high school graduation present. London was an all White unbelievably safe big city. It was civilized and it was one of the greatest big cities in the world. Now it has a higher crime rate than New York City. Something that would have been beyond imagination at the time. Now 35 years later we have the new and improved multicultural London. I guess the only question is what will London look like 35 years from now. Maybe it will get better as New York has. Though I kind of doubt it. </p>

		<p>Apparently this attack occurred in Crawley, Sussex.</p>
<p>Crawley lies deep in the Sussex countryside, but contains within its environs Gatwick airport and an industrial center built up from the 1950s onwards.It was redeveloped as a London &#8216;overspill&rsquo; town, and I thought most of the residents were traditional old stock Londoners and/or Sussex natives.</p>
<p>I am mightily surprised that there any blacks at all in Crawley.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;beating&#8221; is the use of lethal force. NOT just to rob. And taking the wedding ring is an afterthought. They did what they did for the sake and pleasure of just stomping a man nearly to death and enjoyed doing so. Theft and stealing the wedding ring had nothing to do with it. Evil evil people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it [London] has a higher crime rate than New York City.&#8221;</p>
<p>YES, and other parts of Europe are now the same way. That Europe our ancestors left generations ago now is gone forever and is much the worse for it too.</p>

<p>Muslims are a problem. Blacks are a problem.</p>
<p>That one is a problem does not exclude the other.</p>
<p>The greatest problem however, are people like Somalis, who are both black and Muslims.</p>
<p>Not very surprisingly, Somalis are one of the most troublesome immigrant-group in pretty much any country that has a significant number of them.</p>
<p>But you shouldn&rsquo;t stare yourself blind at just one group. Gypsies are another group that can be defined as a very major problem, and they are neither black nor Muslim.</p>

<p>Whites account for 2% of the population of Mauritius. They speak French historically, although they all know at least some English. They run the economy. They often have dual citizenship, like with White Zimbabweans and Britain.</p>

<p>Hasn&rsquo;t multiculturalism enhanced our beautiful country? We have been nothing less than utterly ruined by the open-door policy. Day after day after day we are letting these thugs flood in. And a lot of them have no idea how to behave in a civilised country. Just how bad will it get before a light goes on in our leader&rsquo;s head?<br>

<p>Well I did go to the comment section that showed 469 comments had been made but after only showing six comments they state that they&rsquo;re &#8220;no longer accepting comments&#8221;. I wonder why? My guess is they also saw that Whites are waking up and decided to put a stop to it. Had the races been reversed in this beating you can be sure they would&rsquo;ve accepted comments from now till doonsday!   </p>

Blacks are a problem.<br>
The greatest problem however, are people like Somalis, <br>
who are both black and Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry Guys, you are both wrong</p>
<p>The biggest problem is the &#8220;libtards&#8221; [retarded liberals] who believe in diversity, multi-culturism and consequent enrichment who are responsible for making the regulations which are allowing these people into Europe and thus effectively giving their countries away.</p>
<p>Stop all 3rd world immigration now. No exceptions, and hopefully the trend of anti-social behaviour will be arrested.<br>
Alternatively house all the incoming immigrants in the neighbourhoods where all the libtards reside.<br>
Perhaps that will be the quickest and most effective solution to turn the issue around.</p>

   There is only one solution to gangs of blacks attacking one person to commit that kind of violence. As the article stated this was not about robbery,  It was about the sense of power they attain, not considering the fact that they always have to fight 10 on 1 at least.</p>

<p>Mauritius and Reunion are French islands off the East coast of Africa.<br>
Along with The Seychelles group of islands they are to Africa what Hawaii is to the USA<br>
Most of the residents are white caucasians but miscegenation from the slave era has taken place.</p>
<p>@ No 21</p>
<p>Quite correct.<br>
If you read up on the murders of the white farmers in South Africa you will find exactly the same modus operandi<br>
Individuals overpowered by gangs of at least 5 or 6<br>
Most time it is older females and the old and infirm males that are targetted.<br>
Rarely are young robust males attacked<br>
Before being slaughtered the victims are normally gruesomely tortured for some time<br>
Rarely is anything stolen.</p>
<p>The geniuses within the police describe these slayings as &#8220;a robbery gone wrong&#8221;</p>
