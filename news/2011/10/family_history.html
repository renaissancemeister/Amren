<h1>Family History, Ashkenazi Jewish Lineage Made Swim Coach Proactive</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 90 percent of the estimated 6 million Jewish people living in the United States are of Ashkenazi, or Eastern European, Jewish descent  &mdash;  primarily from Germany, Poland and Russia.</p>
<p>Researchers have shown that Ashkenazi women face a higher risk of breast cancer. Associate professor Sophie Lelièvre, a breast cancer research scientist at Purdue University, said researchers don&rsquo;t know why Ashkenazi women are more prone to breast cancer than other ethnic or racial groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a population that has more of a problem than it used to be,&#8221; Lelièvre said. &#8220;Not only do they have higher risk of developing breast cancer but also a higher risk of developing a very aggressive form of breast cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the Breast Cancer Resource Directory of North Carolina, genetic disorders worldwide are common in various ethnic, racial or geographic groups.</p>
<p>In the Ashkenazi Jewish population, one such genetic disorder is an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Researchers recently discovered that Ashkenazi Jewish women are more likely to have certain alterations in the genes &#8220;BRCA1&#8221; or &#8220;BRCA2&#8221; than women in the general population. As many as 1 in 40 Ashkenazi Jewish women (2.65 percent) might carry one of these alterations, which could put them at higher risk for developing breast and ovarian cancer.</p>

		<p>Another factor is that Ashkenazi Jewish women have an extremely low birth rate, probably the lowest of any ethnic group, and having no children is a risk factor for breast cancer.  There will be very few Ashkenazi Jews left in the US in 50 years except for some Orthodox communities.</p>

		<p>Ashkenazic Jews often have genetic diseases. These are caused by genes that are recessive for the disease, but dominant for superior intelligence. If the Jew has one of the genes at a genetic location the Jew has a higher IQ. If the Jew has two of the genes at the genetic location the Jew has a higher IQ, but also the genetic disease.<br>
 <br>
The reason for this is that for centuries in Europe most Jews were restricted to business and finance. These fields require superior intelligence. Those who could not learn the skills did not survive, or they left the faith. Because the evolution of the Jewish intelligence happened so quickly, Jews picked up some dangerous genes along the way, </p>

		<p>Genetics proved that Ashkenazi Jews are Middle Easterners, very probably coming from Hebrews. On maternal lineage, they have a significant amount of European ancestry, which they received about 15 to 20 centuries ago : very probably, some jewish male immigrants in Europe married European women who converted and whose children were Jews.<br>
Now, what is a Middle Easterner ? He belongs to a big race, with the Europeans and the people from India (whose genetical differences with the Europeans are extremely thin, dixit for instance Arthur Jensen), one of the four big races now on this Earth, the other big races being the yellow  or mongoloïd race (which includes the Amerindians), the black race and the melanesian one. Which name to give to this race ? It seems to me that US citizens, and people here on this site, use indifferently the words White, Caucasian and European, so that they do not have a word to name this big race. Though it exists, and has to be named. </p>

		<p>A higher rate of breast cancer isn&rsquo;t evidence of not being white. My mother had breast cancer. I can assure you we are 100% white. Nor does having a predisposition for a certain disease keep one from being white. Hemochromatosis is the most common hereditary disease in the US primarily affecting people of celtic ancestry. So it&rsquo;s a good idea for people of British or Irish descent to be &#8220;proactive&#8221; and get the blood test.</p>

Thank you for that link&hellip;a very interesting read. I never knew about this and I imagine most of us here have never read this. So the Northern Europeans, especially from  Russia, Sweden and Scotland&hellip; had no admixture with Africans but the Southwestern Europeans had the highest admixture.</p>
<p><br>
Excerpt from the data.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;that within Europe, the Southwestern Europeans have the highest haplotype-sharing with Africans. The proportion decreases to the north and we find no evidence for mixture in Russia, Sweden and Scotland (Table 2, Figure S5). We also detect about 3-5% sub-African ancestry in all the Jewish populations.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Shemites, Hamites, Japhites? Seriously?</p>
<p>Anyway, Ashkenazic Jews are white. Get over it. And they are certainly European. In fact, Ashkenazic Jews have contributed disproportionately to all spheres of European culture and society, especially in the 19th and 20th centuries. And yes, those contributions go beyond Marxism and Critical Theory, thanks for asking. One of the puzzles that I&rsquo;ve encountered since joining the racially conscious far-right is the persistence of anti-Semitism amongst many of its members. As far as I know, Mr. Taylor himself rejects anti-Semitism, yet many of the posters on AmRen clearly don&rsquo;t. Seems like fruitful ground for a little further analytic inquiry. </p>

<p>Why so defensive? Is everything (even facts) so offensive and &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; (I get so tired of that phrase) to you when something (such as that study) is pointed out that may burst your bubble? Jews may have been part of that study, so what is the big deal? What is it you find so offensive? </p>
<p>It is okay to talk about us Whites as a whole, (rednecks, hillbillies, etc.) Christians, Catholics, blacks, mexicans, muslims etc. until we are blue in the face, but heaven forbid, unless we constantly praise the Jews and claim them as our own, then all of a sudden we are &#8220;bashing the Jews&#8221;? This kind of stuff (censorship) that you endorse, is what creates suspicions and feelings that you have something to hide. Is that what you advocate? Even MORE censorship? </p>
<p>Take the good with the bad like the rest of us have to do and quit whining and quit scolding us like we are all 5 year olds. We are all old enough to handle it.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t please everyone, now can we? </p>
<p>Just what is YOUR definition of anti-semitism? EVERYONE is ANTI something! Even you. I am against nonwhite immigration so does that mean I am not allowed to say so because they may be offended? It sure is getting to that point, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>
<p>Anything or fact that may put Jews in a bad light, is that your definition of being anti-semitic? If that is the case, then we had all better forget any sort of free speech and forget the &#8220;Freedom Of Information Act&#8221;..so I guess we all need to just shut up and stifle ourselves just to please your sense of paranoia? </p>
<p>Amren and Jared would go out of business if they could not publish NEWS articles or write books that we ALL find of interest and should we not be free to post our own comments on said subject. Stifling free speech will come back and bite one in the &hellip; so beware what you wish for.</p>

		<p>There is a difference between race and ethnicity. For example a person may be White by race but Celtic, Anglo-Saxon, French or Germanic by ethnicity. Most Jews are a mixture of many different ethnicities but I would venture a guess that most Jews were of the White race but several ethnicities. I would presume that the breast cancer risk would come with several causes, not the least of which would be location (did they study women from all over the US, Europe and Israel or just the East Coast?) as well as the founder effect where a population shares a small set of ancestors.

		<p>More than 4000 genetic diseases have been identified, many specific to racial and ethnic groups. Northern European whites, for example, are at higher risk for cystic fibrosis. Among whites, those of Mediterranian origin are at greater risk for some diseases than are Whites from northern Europe.<br>
Jews have for decades undergone genetic testing in order to eradicate such diseases as Tay Sachs, Gaucher, and Niemann-Picks.<br>
For Americans to eliminate genetic diseases would be much more difficult than for Jews, because so many Americans are themselves mixtures of various ethnic, and racial groups. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s due to inbreeding. Now, in the US, Jewish-Gentile marriages account for ca. 50% of all marriages involving a Jew or Jewess. That means Jewish women - or their female progeny, whatever their ethnic-cultural identification - will step out of the danger zone.</p>
<p>As for superior Jewish achievement i numerous fields, it&rsquo;s certainly far beyond their numbers, but one has to add. Germans, English and French, who came to the history ca. 2000 yrs after the Jews, and whose numbers had been roughly 2-3 times bigger than Jews&rsquo;- all have contributed o the human civilization much more than Jews. Take English and Scots, for instance. No Ockham, Hobbes, Newton, Kelvin, Harvey, Darwin, Jenner, Lister, Boole, Shakespeare, Maxwell, Adam Smith, W.R. Hamilton, Hume, Milton, Gilbert, Cavendish, Dirac,Crick, Locke, Rutherford, Young, Turner, Purcell, &hellip; among the Jews- Spinoza and Einstein excluded. To quote Queen Victoria: &#8220;We are not impressed.&#8221;   </p>

		<p>Observations:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that haplotype analysis has shown that modern Jew&rsquo;s closest relatives are Kurds, Turks, and Armenians.</p>
<p>The classical facies of Einstein and Golda Meir certainly are distinct from the various political faces on television of North European top brass.  They are derived from different bloodlines as shown by migratory arrows on a prehistoric map. Jews are obviously white but not not of the same migratory arrow as the classical caucasions e.g. Celts, Russians, Poles and Germans.  Jews and Celts diverged much earlier than Russians and Poles did.</p>
<p>Post #14, you are misinterpreting any disagreement with any subgroup of Jews as antisemitism. This is unreasonable and patently incorrect.  There is a significant contingent group of Jews who are very cohesive cultural Marxists as well as non-Jew cultural Marxists.  If any subgroup contributes heavily and has an outsized effect, that will will be recognized by other interested groups.  Discussion of this will occur from time to time.  This does not constitute antisemitism.  Aintisemitism is a generic hatred of Jews with a wish to eliminate them.  To call some limited group rivalry, antisemitism,is gross overinterpretation.</p>

&ldquo;that within Europe, the Southwestern Europeans have the highest haplotype-sharing with Africans. The proportion decreases to the north and we find no evidence for mixture in Russia, Sweden and Scotland (Table 2, Figure S5).

		<p>One reader wondered about the definition of &#8220;white.&#8221; The white race includes all people whose native languages are indo-European or semitic. All Europeans, Iranians, Afghanis, Pakistanis, and Indians speak an indo-European language and are related. Hebrew and Arabic are semitic languages. The Turks are also whites. <br>
If you are in doubt about the race of Jews you might be interested in knowing that many can trace their ancestry back to the European Middle Ages. How many Americans are able to trace their ancestry back even four generations?   </p>

		<p>I agree- any criticism of Jews (or Israel for that matter) is considered anti-Semitism by members of the left. To me, this is tantamount to accusations of &#8220;racism&#8221; if one points out the crime, illegitimacy, drug use and welfare rates in the black community. Most of the &#8220;Jews&#8221; that are big in the leftist movements are probably Jews in name only- many of them are likely athiests anyway and havent been inside a synagogue since they were kids if at all. </p>

		<p>Poster 14 Nick K wrote &#8220;One of the puzzles that I&rsquo;ve encountered since joining the racially conscious far-right is the persistence of anti-Semitism amongst many of its members. As far as I know, Mr. Taylor himself rejects anti-Semitism, yet many of the posters on AmRen clearly don&rsquo;t&#8221;</p>
<p>Anti Semitism is disliking Jews because they are Jews.  Being aware of the names of people who are out to destroy Whites is not anti semitism.  It is just being able to read the names of the funders and doers of racist anti White activity.</p>
<p>I have a list of about 800 of the attorneys involved on the anti White side of every anti White lawsuit going back to Brown vs Topeka including all the affirmative action lawsuits.</p>
<p>About 90 percent of the anti White attorneys on the anti White side of these lawsuits have obviously Jewish names.  I don&rsquo;t count names like Becker or Kaufmann that might be German or Jewish.</p>
<p>I am not against Jews, but since affirmative action ruined my life, I am against what so many anti White racists with Jewish names do.  </p>
<p>If 90 percent of the names of 800 anti White attorneys were Italian, French, Irish, Polish, German, Serbian, Hungarian, Croatian, Scots, or English I could not help but notice the ethnicity of the names.  I could not help but conclude that these attorneys had declared a racist war against Whites.</p>
<p>Jews also seem to run the anti White organizations such as ADL, ACLU, NOW, NAACP.</p>
<p>NAACP was a majority White Jewish organization right up to the 1970&rsquo;s when the blacks finally succeeded in taking over their own organization.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no interest in these nit picky discussions of how many Arabs and N. Africans had children with S. Europeans 2,000 years ago or the eternal claims that only blue eyed people are White.</p>
<p>I know the names of the attorneys who have made it illegal to hire a White for a government education or medical job.  </p>
<p>I know the names of the attorneys who condemned millions of White children to attend school with thugs.  </p>
<p>I know the names of the attorneys who made it illegal for school districts to keep the White children safe from the thugs.</p>
<p>I know the names of the attorneys and PR people who work for the restaurant, sweatshop, agricultural, construction, medical and other industries that hire only illegal aliens.</p>
<p>The name of the head of the late sixties EEOC who moved the agency from investigating discrimination against qualified blacks to a quota system for unqualified blacks and a no Whites at all policy was Levin.</p>
<p>&#8220;By your actions you shall know them.&#8221;</p>
<p>One thing I like about the Catholic religion is that it doesn&rsquo;t place much importance on Bible reading or belief.  It focuses on doing good and not doing bad. Maybe that has led me to focus not on what people say, but what people do.</p>
<p>Then there is the little saying I have for all my girl friends involved in unhappy love affairs.  &#8220;Don&rsquo;t listen to what he says, watch what he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>Einstein and other Jewish geniuses neither helped nor hindered me.  </p>
<p>Hundreds of attorneys with obviously Jewish names imposed school busing, affirmative action, unlimited non White immigration, and out of control black on White crime on Whites. Those attorneys and the ADL AJC ACLU and other organizations that funded them have destroyed the lives of Whites.</p>
<p>Why should I love the people who declared and won a judicial war on me because I am White? Why am I called anti semite because I know their Jewish last names?</p>
<p>Who stopped the last Amren conference?</p>
<p><br>
Look at who funded and created Obama. Pritzker, Woods/Rosenwald Axlerod, Rahm Emanuel, Dorhn.</p>
<p>I consider it an insult to classify me as far right.  I am a White nationalist concerned only with White issues, not abortion, guns, welfare, gays, American patriotism or any other rightist issue.</p>
<p>Posting that orthodox Jews are not members of the militant leftist anti White coalition is irrelevant.  Posting the fact that Mayor Bloomberg of NYC and a few others are Republicans is irrelevant to what Jewish attorneys have done to Whites since Brown vs. Topeka.</p>
<p>The foremost anti White organization in the country today is SPLC. Its funds come mostly from wealthy Jews who believe that all the goyim are 80 IQ incestuous, criminal, K, neo nazis out to get them and that only the ever vigilant SPLC will save them from another holocaust.</p>
<p>FYI Tim Wise&rsquo;s organization is run out of the Jewish Museum of &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; and holocaust memorial at Rexford and Pico in Los Angeles. He uses a different address. His office is in the Jewish Museum.</p>

<p>&#8220;The German soldier has impressed the world, however the Italian Bersagliere soldier has impressed the German soldier.&#8221; - Rommel</p>
<p>Unlike you, Rommel came to understand the problem with the Italian Army was it was led by an archaic and utterly corrupt monarchy (the House of Savoy).  Two interesting facts: 1) The Savoy and most of their senior officers were Northern Italians.  2) Italy&rsquo;s best generals in both world wars (Armando Diaz in WW1 and Giovanni Messe in WW2) were Southern Italians.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for the Germans YOU claim who STARTED both wars, maybe you better do a little more digging.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll interject here.  Historical scholars generally agree World War 1 was the result of a series of events culminating in the outbreak of hostilities in 1914.  The murders (there was simply no valid reason to kill that man and his wife, so I refuse to dignify their deaths by calling them &#8220;assassinations&#8221;) of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sofia triggered the so-called &#8220;July Crisis&#8221;, a series of diplomatic maneuverings by the major powers of Europe that culminated in Austria-Hungary issuing an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia.  </p>
<p>Serbia agreed to eight of the 10 demands.   Austria-Hungary, however, wished for war to do away with Serb influence in the northern Balkans.   Russia sided with their allies, the Serbs,  Germany sided with their allies, the Austrians.  It was British wartime propaganda that pinned the blame for the war squarely (and unfairly) on Germany.</p>
<p>World War II, however, was a completely different ballgame! Fact: Hitler demanded the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and promised no further aggression in return.  He lied.  After the occupation of and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by the Germans, even Mussolini&rsquo;s ersthwhile pro-Nazi advisers Italo Balbo and Galeazzo Ciano demanded he end Italy&rsquo;s &#8220;friendship&#8221; with Germany.  He refused.  Every schoolchild knows what happened on September 1st, 1939 and who was to blame.</p>
<p>Germans, however, have a &#8220;rich&#8221; history of territorial aggrandizement and brutality against their neighbors.  A fact that has not been lost on others.</p>

<p>First, its perfectly possible to be caucasian without being white. Arabs are caucasians. Gypsies are caucasians. Iranians are caucasians. It doesnt make them white. The Peace President is presently waging war against three caucasian nations - Iraq, Libya and Afganistan. As you can see from the news, the only white people in these nations are non-locals wearing the uniform of USA or NATO allies. In fact, most caucasians in the world are not white. There are way more of non white caucasians than white. Calling yourself caucasian when you are a white euro is utterly silly. I always ask back &#8220;so you are an arab or perhaps a kurd?&#8221; when someone ignorant white states that hes a caucasian.</p>
<p>Second, by reducing the ashkenazi jews to a bunch of euros with funny looking hats you are not only presenting false narrative, you are also denying them a history that goes back to the bronze age, a history that is confirmed by their genetics, not disproved. </p>

<p>I would like to point out that if there are a percent or two of black blood in an average southern European, how much near eastern and north African blood is there? It has to be considerably more for simple reasons of access. This blood will leave an imprint in the mental profile of an average south European and not a positive one. </p>
<p>Mediterranean European nations does not &#8220;taste&#8221; like north European nations. They are more like something between northern Europe and north Africa, with poor organization, little or no industry and plenty of graft. They are much ahead of north Africa, true, but far behind north Europe, and I don&rsquo;t think that can be explained by happenstance, not for all of them. </p>
<p>The Italian efforts in world war 1 are something Italiophiles should avoid holding up as an Italian achievement. Italian success on the battlefield was not achieved until Austria-Hungary collapsed from the inside and their troops packed their gear and walked home. </p>
<p>In 2nd world war it was even worse. The Brits considered the Mediterranian battlefront against the inept Italians to be something of a sinecure - until the Germans and particularly their infernally effective Luftwaffe showed up. If we look at the underlying industrial infrastructure of Italy we find that technology wise they were at par with far smaller Sweden and falling behind as the war progressed despite German tech transfers. The Italians had neither the tools nor the knowledge to wage war effectively. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that individual Italian soldiers didn&rsquo;t fight bravely - it just meant that they were going to lose the war before it started. </p>

		<p>The significance to me of this item is another example of the genetic differences among human groups. The scientific community  acknowledges this, except where mental capacity is concerned. In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, scientists (who care about their paychecks), allow political correctness to override scientific correctness and agree that all races have equal mental capacities.  </p>

Well seen, Hindenburg the half Mongol, I hadn&rsquo;t remarked before. That said Clemenceau looked like a Mongol yet more. The remark has been made among others by Thomas Mann (pejoratively, when evoking the Versailles Treaty). That said, there is really very little far eastern ancestry among the French (some Alans settled about the town of Orléans, some Huns probably too). Relatively Mongoloid-looking features may certainly appear without any Mongoloïd ancestry. Among the Europeans, it is among the Russians that mongoloïd features trace back to mongoloïd ancestry : for instance Lenin, Chernenko, probably Gorbachev, probably Yeltsin. Among the most spectacular person one can see in Russia : the blue eyed blonde with mongoloïd cheek-bones.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;I am not against Jews, but since affirmative action ruined my life, I am against what so many anti White racists with Jewish names do&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Affirmative Action also ruined my life your post got my attention. All I ever wanted to be was a Geography professor I did the 8 years of study at University. After I could not get a job because they were only interested in Women or minorities. So I tried foreign service, I passed all the tests but they wanted, again, women or minorities. I am now 53 have spent most of my life driving taxis or bartending.</p>
<p>Just curious if you care to, do you have specifics on how affirmative action destroyed your life? I am curious. Though I am sure you found out that nobody cares about victims of Affirmative Action. They just call us racists.</p>
<p>I do not blame Jewish lawyers. I blame myself for not listening to warnings from people who told me what was going onion academia and government jobs. Ironically many of the warnings were from my Jewish neighbors who knew what was going on as far as Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Again if you could share your story maybe some other WN would also be interested. And by the way I am sorry about what AA did to your life. I can relate!<br>

<p>Really? I blame jewish lawyers (along with the ADL/SPLC/ACLU) and as for those jewish neighbors you claim warned you, what did they say about there being so many of their own people who are in huge numbers btw, in every movement and org that is intent on destroying America and the White race?  I don&rsquo;t hear them in the media, protesting and naming the perps, etc. etc. It is easy to say they warned you, but another for them to ACT on their own warnings.</p>

		<p>Buridan, I&rsquo;m trying to say to the people (who basically don&rsquo;t care)- don&rsquo;t be so exclusive &amp; paranoid. White race can assimilate portions of other races and no big deal.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t alienate White - and lighter Mestizo- Hispanics &amp; try to assimilate them. After all, they are the &#8220;race&#8221; European Whites most frequently marry &amp; cohabitate.<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/gk7y" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/gk7y</a></p>
<p>Biologically assimilate Pacific Islanders and Native Americans/Indians.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reject persons who are a bit &#8220;tanned&#8221;, like this one: https://goo.gl/x17go</p>
<p>The only NO-NO race mixing should with Negroid persons, plus unassimilable cultures like Islam.</p>
<p>And yes, I&rsquo;d add Brezhnev, the late general Lebed, and to a certain extent my favorite writer, Dostoevsky.</p>

		<p><i>Second, by reducing the ashkenazi jews to a bunch of euros with funny looking hats you are not only presenting false narrative, you are also denying them a history that goes back to the bronze age, a history that is confirmed by their genetics, not disproved.</i></p>
<p>Yes, exactly like what is happening to American Whites.</p>
<p>A small group of hostile elites depict a false narrative of White history,   disseminated through school textbooks and the media.  We are presented as nothing more than evil slavers, colonists and genocidists, dehumanizing us to nonwhites.  Never-mind that Whites created the First World.</p>
<p>We are being denied ANY history of our people except a VERY biased, revisionist one. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>Howard Zinn is arguably the most influential historian in America.  His textbook <i>A People&rsquo;s History of the United States</i> is assigned reading for courses in colleges and high schools.</p>
<p><i>Rather than an event that inspired movements for freedom and self-government throughout the world through the present, the American Founding is portrayed as a virtually totalitarian system of oppression.</i> </p>
<p>In the conclusion of the book&rsquo;s 1995 edition, Zinn concedes that his work is &ldquo;a biased account&rdquo; and that &ldquo;I am not troubled by that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted my writing of history and my teaching of history to be a part of social struggle,&rdquo; Zinn remarks in an interview conducted long after the release of A People&rsquo;s History of the United States. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Objectivity is impossible,&rdquo; Zinn once remarked, &ldquo;and it is also undesirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>One thing I like about the Catholic religion is that it doesn&rsquo;t place much importance on Bible reading or belief. It focuses on doing good and not doing bad. Maybe that has led me to focus not on what people say, but what people do.<br>

<p>margaret, I am disappointed in what you say in this paragraph.</p>
<p>What do you consider &ldquo;doing good&rdquo; and &ldquo;not doing bad&rdquo;? I see a lot of bad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good works&rdquo; are to no avail&hellip;.we all know the Catholic religion (Church) promotes 3rd world immigration into White lands, not to mention giving them sanctuary, along with many Protestant churches&hellip; Please do focus on what they DO&hellip;as it is killing us&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, you are right about one thing&hellip;they don&rsquo;t place much importance on Bible reading or belief&hellip;.is this a good thing to you? IF, and I mean IF, the Bible is read and understood correctly by Catholics and Protestants alike, it is a good thing, not a bad thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret replies.  </p>
<p>Catholics emphasize doing good and not doing bad.  They don&rsquo;t bother too much about depth of belief.  They pay little attention to the Old Testament. The New Testament after all is the story of Christianity.</p>
<p>Catholics of course do bad things.  They commit sins and crimes. But they are not supposed to do bad things.  The Catholics do not think priests molesting teen agers is good.  That is definitely a very bad sin.</p>
<p>Unfortantely Catholics, at least the bishops, most of the priests and all the nuns believe that unlimited immigration is a good thing.</p>
<p>I on the other hand, believe that both legal and illegal immigration is a very bad thing.</p>
<p>I certainly think that concentrating on being good and avoiding bad is better than endlessly reading the Jewish part of the bible and coming up with endless interpetations of what is essentially a historical myth. </p>
<p>It just depends on what one thinks is good and what is bad.<br>

Genetics proved that Ashkenazi Jews are Middle Easterners, very probably coming from Hebrews. On maternal lineage, they have a significant amount of European ancestry, which they received about 15 to 20 centuries ago : very probably, some jewish male immigrants in Europe married European women who converted and whose children were Jews.&#8221;</p>
<p>So much for Jewish lineage only from the Mother due to the evil cossacks raping them for so many centuries.<br>

#1.  Well, which is it? Racial or what?  If so, then wouldn&rsquo;t the women of the whole White race be genetically the same as the Jewish women? </p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>No, not necessarily.</p>
<p>I will not take a position on this. I understand your point, but in this case I do not think you are pursuing a sound line of argument. Jews remained a separate breeding pool for many centuries, cut off from those around them,  and that is what explains it. Surely, Italian, Polish, or Swedish women may be more or less prone to certain diseases than other nationalities, and so it is with everyone else;  but this does not mean Italian, Polish, and Swedish women are not white. Even Amish people in the USA have different sensitivities. It means simply that they come from different gene pools.</p>

<p>Exactly what could you have done against those anti White plaintiff&rsquo;s attorneys funded and backed by billions of dollars from the Ford, Rockefeller, Woods/Rosenwald/ Carnegie, Tides and many other billion dollar foundations?</p>
<p>Did you even file a friend of the court brief on the pro merit defendant&rsquo;s side?  One does not have to be an attorney to file a friend of the court brief. I filed a pro Prop 209 brief with the California supreme court.  I had a pro Prop 209 brief all ready to file with the US supreme Court had the case gone to the Supreme Court.  I am not an attorney.</p>
<p>Exactly how would you have stopped the tenured professors from preaching their message of hatred of Whites?</p>
<p>Lawsuits do not just fly into the clerk&rsquo;s office on a magic carpet.  They are filed by attorneys who spend much time and money first investigating and then writing them so they can win.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to not blame the attorneys, especially as in many of the affirmative action cases the unqualified black plaintiffs did not approach the attorneys, the attorneys and civil rights activists spend years searching for the plaintiffs.<br>

<p>Good thing about Catholicism is that it&rsquo;s, institutionally, the inheritor of great cultural Western tradition. It wasn&rsquo;t for nothing that EU liberal elites fiercely opposed Pope&rsquo;s (John Paul II) initiative that Christianity be explicitly mentioned as one of the pillars of Europe. Catholicism is, more than Protestantism, *the* Western cultural heritage (books, Universities, art, music, etc.). So, it&rsquo;s part of White identity &amp; opposed- more subtly- to Islam (Evangelical opposition is more radical, but vulnerable to short-fuse syndrome).</p>
<p>After all, media hysteria about pedophilia scandals is exaggerated-although, of course, the events were, for the most part, real - and led by &#8220;liberal&#8221; media. Liberal multiculturalists somehow &#8220;sniff&#8221; their central enemy.</p>
<p>Bad thing about Catholicism- from my standpoint- is it&rsquo;s universality (and, of course, dogmatism in irrelevant issues plus gerontocracy). But, as I see it, the color of Catholicism is still White and, well, &#8220;brown&#8221;, among Hispanics. It&rsquo;s Protestantism (Evangelical variant) which is much faster growing in Africa, India, China etc. If CC sometimes pushes for immigration, it&rsquo;s mostly about White and Brown Hispanics- but no Muslims, Africans, East Asians, Hindus,..<br>
The latter is reserved for mainline Protestants &amp; Evangelicals.</p>
<p>Of course, the immigration should be strongly reduced, but even then- better Pancho than Mkelele, Venkataram or Huang.   </p>

<p>Fact: the largest &#8220;concentration camp&#8221; in Italy during WW2 was located in Calabria in Southern Italy.  It was administered ENTIRELY by Southern Italians.  It housed over 3,800 people, most of them German, Austrian and Polish Jews.  Contrast the treatment they received there with that dished out by your more &#8216;flavorful&rsquo; Northern Europeans.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mediterranean European nations does [sic] not &ldquo;taste&rdquo; like north European nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since I&rsquo;ve never taken a bite out of any country or people I have no idea what you&rsquo;re talking about.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Italian efforts in world war 1 are something Italiophiles should avoid holding up as an Italian achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Why not?  Italy fought your mighty Austria-Hungary to a stalemate for most of the war.  For a small, underdeveloped country I&rsquo;d call that an &#8216;achievement&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Italian success on the battlefield was not achieved until Austria-Hungary collapsed from the inside and their troops packed their gear and walked home.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a lie!  The Austrians fought ferociously at the Battle of the Piave River, suffering 12,000 fatalities, 90,000 wounded and 25,000 captured.  If they &#8220;walked home&#8221; they sure had a funny sense of direction.</p>
<p>By the way, historical scholars know (unlike you) Italian victories over Austro-Hungarians forces contributed in no small way to the collapse of their empire.</p>
