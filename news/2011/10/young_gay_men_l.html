<h1>Young Gay Men Lead in New HIV Infections</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gracie Bonds Staples, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thirty years into the HIV/AIDS epidemic, gay and bisexual men of all races remain most affected by HIV in the U.S., said Tracy Elliott, executive director of AID Atlanta.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2009, he said white men accounted for the largest number of new infections  &mdash;  11,400  &mdash;  - followed closely by black men  &mdash;  10,800. In Georgia, there were 1,366 new HIV diagnoses in the same year. Of those, 49 percent were among gay men, with blacks accounting for 74 percent, whites 21 percent and Hispanics 5 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among gay white men, Elliott said, the distribution was very consistent, about 3,200 new infections for those aged 13 to 29.</p>
<p>But among black gay men like Tim Ward, the latest numbers show the distribution was weighted toward those 13 to 29 with 6,500 new infections.</p>
<p>Elliott blamed the disproportionate number on to the significant levels of poverty and unemployment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: According to 2010 Census Data, Georgia is 55.9 percent white, 30.5 percent black, and 8.8 percent Hispanic.</em>]</p>

		<p>It is good to see that the media is finally looking at the rising rate of HIV among young White men. I certainly do not wish the disease on anyone. Moreover, I  do not have it, <br>
However, the media has a tendency to place a Black or lower income face on HIV when in fact there are many other ethnic  socio-economic groups afflicted with the disease. </p>

<p>How in the hell does unemployment and poverty have anything to do with getting HIV? Why then isn&rsquo;t HIV exploding in WHITE Appalachia? Why then isn&rsquo;t HIV exploding amongst the Mexicans living in virtual shanty towns along the border, they&rsquo;re MUCH poorer than any inner-city ghetto thug! Have you seen the cloths, &#8220;jury&#8221; ( jewelry ) and &#8220;bling&#8221; THEY have? That&rsquo;s not poor!</p>
<p>A lot of gay White men actively seek out black men for sex and many of them end up getting HIV, so I wonder how much of the HIV among the Whites is a result of inter-racial sex with blacks? I&rsquo;ve tried to warn them of the danger of having sex with blacks but they just dismiss me as a racist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going off subject here but I need to get something off my chest. Even though I&rsquo;m a gay White man, most of my friends are straight and I&rsquo;ve always lived and worked among straight people that KNEW I was gay and I have rarely had a problem with them because you know why - I carry myself as a man, I don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;homo chip&#8221; on my shoulder and I don&rsquo;t rub my sex life in their faces. Unlike blacks and other gays, I don&rsquo;t move into a straight neighborhood or get a job at a company and then expect THEM to be &#8220;sensitive&#8221; to MY life style. I personally don&rsquo;t WANT to work in a &#8220;gay friendly&#8221; workplace, just treat me and promote me ( or demote me ) like everyone else. The saddest day of my life is watching those dreaded &#8220;gay pride&#8221; parades on the nightly news once a year, do you guys have &#8220;straight pride&#8221; parades? I get alot of flack from other gays on my &#8220;opinions&#8221;, being called the usual &#8220;nazi&rsquo;, &#8220;racist&#8221; and, can you believe it - a homophobe! Being a gay conservative is like being Clarence Thomas at a new black panther gathering!    </p>

		<p>This is the real explanation: men are more sexual than woman.  Blacks are more sexually driven than whites.  When you have a society of black, gay men you will have a much higher level of sexual promuscuity and partner exchange.  Combine that with black men&rsquo;s lower average IQ and you get a recipe for STDs.  It has nothing to do with poverty or unemployment.  Condoms can be had for free.</p>

<p>Perhaps the brilliant Tracy Elliott would be good enough to explain to us ignorant rubes how poverty and unemployment cause AIDS.  And I&rsquo;m sure medical researchers around the world would be interested in this new finding.</p>
<p>Oh, well, the consequences of black behavior are <i>never</i> the responsibility of blacks themselves, are they?  It would be Racist to assume otherwise.<br>

<p><br>
When they say &#8220;white&#8221; men, they use the catch-all term &#8220;white&#8221; to mean there are no such sub groups of &#8220;White&#8221; men? They can&rsquo;t list those in the sub groups?  Is this deliberate or what? </p>

<p>13-year olds?  &#8220;Men?&#8221;  In most states, it&rsquo;s statutory rape to touch a 13-year old.  A 13-year old presenting with HIV or AIDS should warrant a police investigation for stat rape.</p>

 <br>
I see, so if one is prosperous and employed, they can still engage in substantially identical patterns of reckless sex and needle sharing drug behavior and have less chance of contracting AIDS?  Aren&rsquo;t condoms and safer sex advice free, conspicuous and ubiquitous at all social service, welfare, and public health department clinics nationwide?  Don&rsquo;t most states have free disposable needle programs for needle drug addicts?  Seems to me that the welfare junkie/on the down low fag that Tracy Elliot is referring to has more opportunities and visible reminders to take precautions than the rest of the world.<br>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say they&rsquo;ve been looking very hard. Over 600,000 Americans have died of AIDS. We&rsquo;ve never, ever, learned the race of those who&rsquo;ve died. We&rsquo;ve only ever learned about the rate of &#8216;new cases&rsquo; just as we do here. There&rsquo;s no other disease where those killed are not tabulated by race. It has taken 30 years, but on occassion the media will now discuss, in some locations, the current death rate of AIDS by race.  </p>

		<p>Is there anyone left in the U.S. who doesn&rsquo;t know that condoms help protect against HIV/AIDS?</p>
<p>So in addition to blaming poverty we can blame IQ?  I doubt it.  More likely a causal factor is the high degree of addiction in the gay community and its concommitent affect on the immune system paired with poorly made choices.</p>
<p>More money, more sex education and more tolerance will scarcely make a dent in resolving compulsive and unhealthy habits.</p>

		<p>Every single solitary article that&rsquo;s written about a health problem being worse among blacks always has to end with the same threadbare statement that the problem is caused by lack of money or lack of access to health care.  It&rsquo;s like a disclaimer that the writer didn&rsquo;t mean anything racist about his contentions.  I believe that if someone wrote a piece about some disease being prevalent among millionaire black rappers, the same statement would be tacked on at the end!</p>

<p>Rather cryptic statement here.  The white men you refer to, are they prostitutes?  Prostitution isn&rsquo;t new, you know.  As for unatractive woman &#8220;turning&#8221; gay, don&rsquo;t they usually go black?</p>

		<p>My impression is that homosexual black men - at least the men who admit to being homosexual - seem to be more likely effeminate, more likely to be prostitutes, more likely to be the receptive partner, and thus more vulnerable to infection.  More likely to be sent to jail, and raped there.</p>
<p>Perhaps among blacks, soft or delicate boys are more often sexually abused and pushed into homosexuality than among whites.  Throw in less of a future time orientation (less condom use) and more drug use - there&rsquo;s a problem.  Twice the new infection rate with a sixth the population is pretty much in line with other disproportionate black pathologies.</p>

<p>What? The notoriously gay areas like West Hollywood in CA are FAR from poverty/unemployment. In fact, West Hollywood, while being majority gay, is one of the most expensive areas to live in Los Angeles. Instead of making excuses they should instead recognize this as a serious issue people of the homosexual variety face, otherwise how are you ever going to actually solve the problem? </p>

		<p>The REAL reason why HIV/AIDS infection rates are so much higher among gay and/or bisexual Black men is because most of them (particularly those who have relationships with or are married to women) WILL NOT admit that they are gay  &mdash;  now or ever. Many of them believe that having sex with other men in a clandestine manner does not &#8220;make them&#8221; gay and that everything is &#8220;cool&#8221; as long as their women, their families and others see them as &#8220;straight&#8221;. Tragically, these same men will be either extremely hesitant or downright resistant to use condoms when having sex with men because they (ignorantly) view HIV/AIDS as the so-called &#8220;gay white man&rsquo;s disease&#8221;. For better or worse, homosexuality is viewed by the Black community as one of the &#8220;ultimate&#8221; sins. As incredible as it may seem, many feel that if a Black man gets infected with an STD by a (female) prostitute it&rsquo;s less &#8220;Sinful&#8221; than if he got it from a man. </p>

<p>And this ought to give pause (but will not) to those who claim that the solution to AIDS (and unwanted pregnancies, etc) is education and availability of prophylactics.  </p>
<p>Well, cheer up, we can all look forward to the government being pressured into providing &#8220;free&#8221; AIDS drugs.<br>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t possible when communal support for gay relationships in an area such as West Hollywood is very positive (that is why gay people move there is it not?). Most &#8220;gay communities&#8221; come to be out of some threat from a bigger national culture that is hostile to them, granting the a safe and secure place for their views (which would in tern create more self esteem as they recognize that there are others like them&hellip;and to practice freely).</p>
<p>I have a different view.</p>
<p>=&gt; Gay person wants to &#8220;try something new&#8221; and contracts HIV and brings it to the US (after the spread in Africa)<br>
=&gt; Aids quickly spreads in gay circles due to the liberal views of sex where the emphasis is placed upon quick pleasure and pushing boundaries rather then a conservative view of bonding in monogamous relationship<br>
=&gt; increased risks of HIV</p>
<p>This, natural selection, rewards those who are intelligent enough to not impulsively sleep with strangers and seek a potential mate  by thoroughly examining them. </p>
<p>Ironically, the benefit is most likely lost if the inherent intelligence plays a role, due to the fact that procreation is done only heterosexually.</p>
<p>On a grander (sub group) level it is weeding out a defect in our gene pool. A certain mindset walk in hand with this group, where defying the norm becomes the conventional reality and who very behavior diminishes the chance of reproduction&hellip;which is already nearly non existent group in a group who believe that survival and the reproduction of genes (via procreation) is non essential.</p>

		<p>Anyone here remember back in the late 80s/ early 90s, when Madonna, the queen of no talent and a big mouth, and all like her, were claiming that gay men were really not the main victims/ carriers of the disease?<br>
Remember when the media got behind this, and tried to bamboozle America into thinking it was going to be a white heterosexual epidemic, and all that fixation on the fact that gay men were about 90% of the cases, was just an illusion, and MEAN?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just like the whole multicultural lie&hellip;it eventually shows up as a ridiculous farce. <br>
Where&rsquo;s the media retraction now?<br>
Just like denying mass black crime&hellip;where will the media apologies be, for dropping the stories?<br>
Never trust the media. Never trust anyone in power in such a corrupt, amoral regime.<br>

Homosexuality is viewed by the Black community as one of the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; sins. As incredible as it may seem, many feel that if a Black man gets infected with an STD by a (female) prostitute it&rsquo;s less &ldquo;Sinful&rdquo; than if he got it from a man. &#8220;</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>I believe you&rsquo;ve hit on a very important point.  So very, very  many of them are living  in denial.</p>
<p>Exactly the same thing goes for Latinos.   I had an acquaintance, a Latino, who died of AIDS.  He NEVER said he had AIDS, nor even hinted at it. Not a word.

<p>The nurse asked me to try to get through to him,  but I was not going to tell someone he was dying. That was not my job. I was only  there as a visitor.  If I had told him, he would have ordered me to get out and don&rsquo;t come back!</p>
<p>To people like that,  OTHER people get AIDS   &mdash;     not them.  Latins emphasize being macho.  Blacks too.   And, above all, they are not honest with themselves.  You&rsquo;re up against a huge mental  and cultural  obstacle here. </p>

<p>There was an article written by a New York Times reporter a couple of years ago (I beleive his name was Benoit-Diaz),that discussed the fact that number of younger gays (especially under 35) frequent integrated bath houses and seek out sex partners of other races. </p>

<p>Oh, please&hellip;..of course he is anti-White (read between the lines, sometime) he loves telling us he has been with many men and a lot of WHITE men and is very pro-gay. Yeah, it would be real &#8220;interesting&#8221; to hear what he has to say&hellip;NOT!</p>
<p> Why would you even want him to come back and post? He isn&rsquo;t what we need, that is for sure, and I could care less about what he &#8220;thinks&#8221; of this article and his spin on it. Don&rsquo;t you hear enough of the gay rhetoric?</p>

<p>I have been out of town for a few days. Thank you for acknowledging my occasional contributions to this website. As is often the case, the comments on this particular topic range frmo thoughtful and accurate (such as poster #2) and outlandish and bordeline insane (posters #11,16 and 27).</p>

In urban areas, it is not uncommon for Black gay professionals and White gay professionals to attend interracial bath houses. I have only frequented a couple of bath houses when I was in my mid 20s. It was not my scene so to speak.  While it is true that there is a segment of the gay Black community that is relatively exclusionary toward Whites (this is based on power control reasons),many Black gay men (especially in the upper classes) have good relationships with White gay men.   </p>

Maybe Obama can recruit these gay black men to help fight his war in Uganda? Of course Obama wants us in Uganda. Time to fight for the blacks and send our White soldiers to do the fighting, right Obama? We know your game plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a lot of oil in Uganda.  The goverment has just given permission to drill.  That is why Obama&rsquo;s handlers told him to send troops to Uganda.<br>

		<p>Condoms do not prevent AIDS at all.  </p>
<p>The virus goes right through condoms.  The lining of the intestines is only 1 cell thick.  Furthermore, the intestinal lining contains receptor cells.  Basically a hook that grabs onto whatever is passing through the intestines.</p>
<p>The receptor cells help suck nourishment out of the intestines into the blood stream.  Receptor cells are what makes suppositories so quick acting.</p>
<p>The medical profession knows that condoms do not prevent AIDS.  The condom thing is pushed by the endless gay advocacy groups.</p>
<p>Maybe 4 or 5 condoms might work, but one is useless.</p>

<p>I would argue that we need to hear more voices like Gay Black Man and Gay Conservative (another poster on this board who is White)on such topics. They certainly would have a better vantage point on the issues and other matters related to the topic as opposed to straight heterosexual White men who are largely, if not entirely, removed from such a underworld.</p>

<p>I have many concerns nd interests. I am a very active, healthy, intelligent person with a wide variety of friends straight and gay and of all races. </p>
<p>To answer your questions, Everything I have posted on this website is indeed truthful. Secondly, the majority of topics on this website deal with issues that do not necessarily relate to me or affect me, therefore, I do not spend time commenting on such issues. However, I have commented on several posts that discuss race and gender oriented topics. </p>
<p>On another note, I would like to clear up this notion for a few posters who seem to be obsessed with my sex life. I previously stated that I have been sexually involved with men across racial lines (including other Black men). I mentioned this fact only once and for some reason, some of you posters are under the impression that I have been slumming around sleeping with hundreds of White men. Well, that is not the case. While I still engage in sex with men of all races, I am very disciplined in regards to my sexual behavior. I am not promiscuous. </p>
<p>I am a successful, well educated, intelligent, confident person and I am proud of who and what I am and do not apologize for it. <br>
 <br>
Apparently, I have struck a nerve with a few of you.  </p>
<p><b>[I should not have allowed the previous comment that intruded into your private life.  Honestly, I shouldn&rsquo;t approve this comment, either, but fair is fair.  Going forward, I am going to to keep my antenna up for these kinds of comments and reject them.  Conversation about the private sex lives of AR posters makes for good comments not.   &mdash;   Moderator]</b></p>

No, I am not friends with nor do I know Gay Black Man. Calm down with the paranoia. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, I stand by my previous post. Hearing from more openly gay male (or lesbians for that mater) posters on this issue would be good thing. He does make some interesting comments which is more than I can say for you and some other &#8220;anonymous&#8221; posters who would rather engage in cheap, personal attacks without providing any substantive arguments.</p>

Homosexuality is viewed by the Black community as one of the &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; sins. As incredible as it may seem, many feel that if a Black man gets infected with an STD by a (female) prostitute it&rsquo;s less &ldquo;Sinful&rdquo; than if he got it from a man. &ldquo;</p>
<p>========</p>
<p>I believe you&rsquo;ve hit on a very important point. So very, very many of them are living in denial.</p>
<p>Exactly the same thing goes for Latinos. I had an acquaintance, a Latino, who died of AIDS. He NEVER said he had AIDS, nor even hinted at it. Not a word. In fact, he hated people with AIDS and had nothing but contempt and abuse for them. He was very mean to them, would practically spit on them. </p>

The same can be said for many White men. Bruce Bower in his book A Place At The Table disucusses how so many White men he had counseled in the early 1990s were in denial about their sexuality and behavior. He argued that many of them went to their death beds denying their situation.</p>
