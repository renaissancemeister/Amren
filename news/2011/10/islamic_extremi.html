		<p>I&rsquo;m with Jack from Chicago.  Al-Alwaki wasn&rsquo;t some domestic purse snatcher, nor a domestic gangster/murderer, he was actively participating with a declared hostile foreign potentate and actively planned what are really acts of warfare against us.  He was an &#8220;American citizen&#8221; inasmuch as his mother just so happened to be in Las Cruces, New Mexico when she went into labor, and at that, he was a Yemeni citizen all along.  I thought we were opposed to this &#8220;birthright citizenship&#8221; nonsense.  </p>
<p>I approve of his summary assassination, and I don&rsquo;t fear any so-called &#8220;slippery slope,&#8221; because I don&rsquo;t believe in slippery slopes for their own sake; it is a logical fallacy.  The local cops aren&rsquo;t going to summarily assassinate people who run stop signs just because President Obama stumbled on doing the right thing (broken clock is right twice a day, after all).  I also don&rsquo;t believe in consistency, as in ideological rectitude, as some in this thread seem to think we need to.</p>

<p>Sorry, if that&rsquo;s what it comes to,  I think I&rsquo;d rather take my chances with putting him in Alcatraz. That sounds like the safer bet.</p>

<p>Are you kidding me? Your comparison of Anwar al - Awlaki and Capone is ridiculous. Awlaki fled to another country and actively sought to destroy, kill and harm America in any way possible, yet people like you think he has a right to hide behind the protection citizenship in America offered him? At the very least, I call this treason, and if he had chosen to, he could have turned himself in and been given a fair trial to defend himself, yet he did not. Instead he continued on with his call for the destruction of the very nation you claim he still had &#8220;rights&rsquo; in. Absurd!</p>
<p>Btw, I&rsquo;ll have to read up on my Capone history, because it sure is news to me that he killed &#8220;thousands&#8221; of people. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure he never betrayed America in such a blatant way either.</p>

		<p>Al Capone broke laws for personal gain, and certainly killed people (Though I haven&rsquo;t read his biography, I question the assertion that he killed &#8220;thousands&#8221;). But he did not make war on the American nation-state as such, and it was, from a practical point of view, possible to apprehend and try him. This makes his case altogether different from Islamic terrorists who direct war against America as such from bases in foreign countries. Clearly, such people have by their actions renounced their citizenship and cannot claim its protections.</p>

<p>Which is, the government decides what is &#8220;terrorism&#8221; and &#8220;war against the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get it when Amren is labeled a terrorist organization and accused of inciting violence against America and &#8220;Americans.&#8221;  But by then it will be too late.</p>
<p>The trend is the important thing.  And the trend in this country is disturbing.  Look at this next to Homeland Security memos saying that people who frequent sites such as this are domestic terrorists and it should come into focus.</p>

		<p>1965 - It&rsquo;ll just be a few Third World immigrants, it won&rsquo;t change anything about our country.</p>
<p>2011 - It&rsquo;s not like he was REALLY an American citizen or something, it has no bearing on the rest of us.</p>
<p>They also said divorce wouldn&rsquo;t lead to the cheapening of marriage to the point that Americans would be on the verge of accepting two men getting married.  They said the slippery slope was a logical fallacy too.  Then everything we said would happen, happened.</p>
<p>If Amreners are unwilling to accept the slippery slope is a real thing I can&rsquo;t see that they&rsquo;ve learned a single thing from the past 50 years.  Seems to me that the evidence is all around us.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the answer to your quandry;  Christian missionaries have interfered throughout the world with greater success in some regions than others, but there&rsquo;s hardly a place or people they have not attempted to occupy and convert.  The conceit of the left is the same conceit of those who would spread &#8220;civilization&#8221; via Christianity; They truly believe they are so strong in their culture and Christianity that others will be changed by it rather than the other way around.  European governments and even many Church leaders seem to think that they can be accepting of them and it will pay off later on with some sort of conversion and cultural absorption that will retain Christian and European identity.  Of course, they are terribly and tragically wrong.</p>

		<p>The resistance in Europe to the Islamic invasion is pathetic at best, to claim that any current organization is effective in curbing or effecting the state of affairs with regard to mass immigration of Africans and others to the old continent is totally oblivious to the facts. Reality reveals that most governments actively support immigration and actually open the doors by way of legislation and political decision making all across the continent. For anyone naïve enough to believe that the indigenous people of Europe have a say in this development is to believe a fantasy. Europe is losing the battle against the &ldquo;Invasion&rdquo; because of low birth rates on the one side and high birth rates and simply by the numbers involved that are coming in and making themselves at home in Europe to hope for a Hollywood style &ldquo;happy end&rdquo; to this story. Vlaams Block has had little to no effect on this sad development whatsoever. The outcome for Europe to which the continent is at present facing can and will, if not arrested, destroy the culture and people that once gave the world its greatest minds and ideas. What is needed is real and effective opposition until this is somehow formed Europe will go the way of the great US American cities like Detroit, not a pretty picture.</p>

		<p>Well, so much for the Constitutional Republic that we claim to want to save. </p>
<p>You people, above, are unbelievable. During prohibition, thousands of people died in Gangland killings, for profit in the Illegal production and distribution of alcohol.</p>
<p>You better believe that Al Capone had his hands in many of those murders. Al didn&rsquo;t have to pull the trigger on each murder victim to be responible for the deaths of those people. He just needed to order the hit.   </p>
<p>Al-Whatever was an American Citizen and did give up his right to his Constitutional protections when he called for open warfare against the US, in a foreign country. </p>
<p>But how about those nut cases, that are born here, and want to commit a crime of action against us, here?  </p>
<p>Do we discard their protections under the Constitution, which forces the Government to do a thorough job in its investigation and arrest of the suspects, or do we let the Government come in and, as they have in the past, make an arrest, or shoot the wrong person, because they thought they had the right man? </p>

<p>If it was up to me, there would be no brown or black faces anywhere on that Continent, simply because they would not be allowed to enter, so deportation would never become an issue.</p>

<p>American Renaissance is a magazine/forum devoted to White racial realism - defending the legitimate rights of of our Indo European White Western people in the United States and wherever we still exist in this increasingly hostile world. We&rsquo;re working to see that White people in places like Belgium, London England, and now Philadelphia do not fall victim to anti White genocide as our White kinsmen did in Algeria, Zimbabwe, Detroit! </p>
<p>Amren.com is not a race denying, 100% Libertarian/Constitutionalist forum  - we don&rsquo;t want to hear your ridiculous nonsense that the likes of Al Qaeda terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki or Mohammed Ata or the whole diseased island of Black Haiti should be given full &#8220;American citizenship&#8221; under some legal technicality of &#8220;birth right citizenship&#8221; or some other legal hair splitting nonsense!</p>
<p>Take a look at this video of the racial/culltural clash in Belgium between our White Western people in the Vlaams Belang and these dark, hairy, 87th century Arab Muslim barbarians. Do you really have a hard time understanding which side we are on?</p>
<p>How do Japanese Nationalists deal with these issues? Think there are many/any Japanese Nationalists that want to give full Japanese citizenship to the likes of Al Qaeda terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki?</p>

		<p>15:  Unbelievable?  What&rsquo;s unbelievable is that you can&rsquo;t seem to distinguish between domestic crime and a foreign enemy.  Those &#8220;nut cases born here and want to commit a crime of action against us here&#8221; are committing a domestic crime, not cavorting with a declared hostile enemy plotting acts of war against us.  Maybe this controversy wouldn&rsquo;t be a controversy if Congress would actually declare war and use the word &#8220;war&#8221; against specific countries, groups and actors, not this meely mouthed mush about &#8220;authorization to use military force&#8221; against fill in the blank/whoever.</p>
<p>10:  Does that possibility exist in the future?  Yes.  But at this moment, I&rsquo;m not so worried.  The reason is that the official definition of &#8220;terrorism&#8221; is pretty solid.  You actually have to engage in terrorism to be a terrorist, legally speaking.  None of this Southern Poverty Law Center ticky tack bull waste about how you&rsquo;re &#8220;linked&#8221; to &#8220;extremists&#8221; if you stayed in the same motel room that the fifth cousin of someone who once went to a K rally once stayed.  Even the SPLC is loath to throw around the &#8220;terrorist&#8221; label generously.</p>

		<p>Sorry to have to weigh in on the Capone-al-Awlaki matter, but Capone was, if not the most patriotic of men, an American: &#8221; This American system of ours, call it Americanism, call it capitalism, call it what you will, gives each and every one of us a great opportunity if we only seize it with both hands and make the most of it.&#8221;  He certainly (in his own way) loved this country, and what it offered.  Al-Awlaki was an out-and-out traitor, openly and flagrantly calling for and working toward the destruction of the U.S., the American way of life, and the lives of individual Americans.  I am not an expert in the law of treason, but would like to hear form anyone who is, so that we can all be informed on what constitutional rights and protections are given a traitor in a foreign land.  I for one would not be alarmed or offended if a so-called citizen who acts so blatantly adverse to the nation he supposedly owes allegiance, in a foreign land and among people who are actively seeking our downfall, is summarily killed, similar to a soldier.  If al-Awlaki had on the uniform of our enemy (and Al-Qaeda does not have uniforms), he could have justifiably been terminated.<br>

<p>You would think that white libertarian/Constitutionalists would beat the drums for white nationalism even louder than we do.  After all, what good is a written Constitution if a society full of fanatical Arab/Muslim mullahs and imams, or a society full of black Haitians with their typical black warlord/strongman mentality, don&rsquo;t heed the words on paper?</p>
<p>You mentioned Japan.  When we caught up to the Ron Jeremy look alike, (Ramzi Yousef&rsquo;s uncle, name escapes me) in Afg. in 2003-4, and we shook him down for info, he confessed that AQ was planning to attack Japan when they hosted the 2002 Soccer World Cup (actually co-hosted with South Korea).  They all quickly gave up on those plans when they realized that they couldn&rsquo;t get the necessary ground network going in any Japanese cities. </p>
<p>The reason they couldn&rsquo;t was obvious   &mdash;   Japan isn&rsquo;t dumb enough to let them immigrate in for &#8220;diversity&rsquo;s&#8221; sake   &mdash;   Tokyo hath not a Grover Norquist.</p>

I suppose Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and George Washington were also clueless &#8220;Race realists&#8221;, or whatever the term is today. The term changes almost every day, on this site.</p>
<p>No, gentlemen, I have been informed my whole life about our present situation, and didn&rsquo;t come late to the party like so many here have claimed, after a &#8220;traumatic experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>But unlike many here, I want the Constitutional Republic preserved, as it was intended. That also means I want the demographics of the Country to revert back to what is was through the 1960s. &#8220;For ourselves and our posterity&#8221; is the closing phrase in the preamble of the Constitution. Who was the intended posterity of the Founding Fathers, then?</p>
<p>I grew up and watched the country descend into hell because of what was allowed to happen. One voice, alone, will do nothing to stop the tide.</p>
<p>How about deporting the 30 million plus, Illegal Aliens in this country? Have any of you supported these groups, and Politicians that call for this? </p>
<p>Here we have millions of undocumented people among us, committing crimes, yet they want America-born Citizens, and those Naturalized, to carry ID cards. Why? Why not just close the borders, especially to hostile types, and deport those Illegals that don&rsquo;t belong here?</p>
<p>Americans should be free to travel, unmolested, without having to produce National ID cards, and the rest of the Soviet-style nonsense.</p>
<p>If people desire this kind of country, there are many others to choose from. <br>

		<p>25:  I doubt this applies to you.  But if we give <i>soi distant</i> modern libertarians any serious political power, it will result in the American Federal government becoming bigger, more expensive, more abusive and more intrusive in the long run.  Counterintuitive?  Paradoxical?  Yes, but think it through   &mdash;   Most libertarians want free trade and open borders.  That results in a more non-white America and an decreasingly prosperous white America.  The &#8220;brown dog&#8221; mentality of blacks is that of a strong man or a warlord, that of Chicano Hispanics is that of large scale tribes.  Neither are compatible with what we consider republican Constitutional governance.  Also, with less prosperous whites, that only increases white use of welfare.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity #26: I agree with you. I certainly am no Libertarian. I do believe in preserving our Constitution, and the guarantees it enshrines.  </p>
<p>I want to see Fair Trade, not this Free Trade scam that has placed millions of Americans out of work. </p>
<p>So here, I want the repeal of NAFTA; along with secured borders, and the immediate deportation of all Illegal Aliens, as well as those foreign and hostile, to our traditional culture. </p>
<p>Think about how many people laughed at Ross Perot, while he was running for President, and stated that NAFTA would destroy American Industry, and its Middle Class. </p>
<p>I ask those former Clinton voters about their jobs, or lack of them, today. </p>
<p>If we can get out of the UN, and other international organizations, we would be much better off, by not supporting them finacially, nor adhering to their Global treaties which violate our sovereignty. </p>
