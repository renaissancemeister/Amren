			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Russell Contreras, MSNBC, October 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A grocery store worker accused of handing out a semen-tainted yogurt sample at an Albuquerque market pleaded guilty Thursday.</p>
<p>Under terms of his plea agreement, Anthony Garcia admitted he tainted a sample of the yogurt he was handing out at Sunflower Market in January. He also admitted putting some of his semen on a plastic spoon that he placed with the yogurt.</p>
<p>Garcia then approached a female customer and offered her a sample.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The woman told police that after tasting the sample, she spit on the floor several times and wiped her mouth on the garment she was wearing to get the taste out of her mouth. Investigators collected samples of the woman&rsquo;s spit from the floor and took the garment she was wearing as evidence.</p>
<p>Police say Garcia was linked to the yogurt through DNA samples. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Garcia faces up to three years of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release. {snip}</p>

		<p>This is the THIRD such story I have read in the last two years about a latino man doing this.  One time before it was also yogurt, and in another incident it was in a water bottle.  In all three instances, the victims were white women.  Think of all the times that no one has been caught!</p>

		<p>When I was stationed in Germany, there were Turkish delicatessens all over the cities that made something called Schwarma (basically a Muslim version of the Gyro). They were delicious but rumors about the way they were prepared especially for American servicemen (rumors I won&rsquo;t really touch on here in the name of decency) scared most of us off the sandwiches.</p>
<p>This was years before Thilo Sarrazin&rsquo;s bombshell dropped, or before I was racially-aware. But navigating German streets filled with knife-armed Turks selling hash, where I expected to see Germans in Leiderhosen, made a strong and lasting impression on me.</p>

		<p>How disgusting. I never take samples from a grocery store, won&rsquo;t get a salad from an open bar, and actually, our family rarely eat out at all. When we do, it&rsquo;s at a tiny local cafe where my husband and I personally know the owners. Besides, there&rsquo;s not much take out that I can&rsquo;t make ten times better at home. </p>

		<p>Just think of how many times they do this, and aren&rsquo;t dumb enough to put too much of &#8220;themselves&#8221; in the food/drink, and therefore don&rsquo;t get caught.</p>

		<p>Here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, about 10 years ago, a Mexican kitchen worker apparently defecated in the refried beans at a very popular restaurant. As I recall, several hundred people were sickened. The restaurant closed and never reopened.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t eat Mexican anymore, and its getting harder and harder to do so since several Mexican restaurants have recently closed! </p>
<p>ADIOS AMIGOS! </p>

After reading that Trichinosis can lead to Epilepsy, and that unwashed hands and improperly washed raw vegetables can spread the disease, we decided we&rsquo;d had our last Taco Salads.  </p>
<p>Then, our Mayor went on a crime-busting spree, which sort of fanned-out from an investigation of a Mexican restaurant in our town.  Turns out an entire CRIMINAL NETWORK was run from Mexican restaurants scattered across our state.  Infiltration by Mexican Drug Rings was being hidden by those restaurants (Great Money-Laundering opportunity, too!).  Obviously, you couldn&rsquo;t drag me into one of those places, now.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people have figured that out.  And plenty more are simply sick of everything Mexican.  A friend says he buys nothing with a Spanish name, as a form of protest.  Sounds like a pretty good idea.  The votes we make with our spending habits are the only ones that seem to count at all, these days&hellip;<br>

<p>You are so right about that poster!  There are so many mexican restaurants that have little business and it is obvious that it was just a front for their criminal network and money laundering scams. That goes for the Chinese and Indian restaurants also. </p>

		<p>It baffles me upto this day, why do many Americans like Mexican food which for the most part tastes from bad to atbest average. I find Italian &amp; German food very appealling to the palate. Amongst the exotic food I enjoy, I like Mediterranean, middle eastern &amp; some Indian &amp; Thai food. Another place one should avoid are those Chinese &amp; Vietnamese restaurants. As such I find Chinese food unappealing. </p>

		<p>If you want ethnic food for dinner, you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with Italian, German, or French.</p>
<p>Forget eating at places where the cucarachas work and eat, because you are only looking for trouble. </p>

		<p>Grotesque and malicious! Are some of these people so sex-crazed or starved that they resort to deviant activity as this?  I&rsquo;m no prude but it seems that so many Spanish-language TV channels that I blunder upon are filled with lascivious behavior, outrageously flimsy outfits on women and scores of love triangles or worse!</p>
