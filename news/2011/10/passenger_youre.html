			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Gamm, Amarillo Globe-News, October 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Somewhere in the heavens above Amarillo, angry shouts rang out from the back of Southwest Airlines Flight 3683.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&rsquo;re all going to die,&#8221; a man dressed in black screamed at passengers Tuesday afternoon. &#8220;You&rsquo;re all going to hell. Allahu Akbar,&#8221; translated as God is great in Arabic.</p>
<p>Federal authorities arrested Ali Reza Shahsavari, 29, of Indialantic, Fla., onboard the Boeing 737 after pilots made an emergency landing at Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport at 3:30 p.m. He is being held in the Randall County jail on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police said the incident began with Shahsavari arguing with another passenger. The flight crew separated the men, said Amarillo police Cpl. Jerry Neufeld.</p>
<p>Shahsavari went into a bathroom and yelled obscenities from the rear of the plane, said passenger Doug Oerding, of Sacramento, Calif. Attendants tried to calm Shahsavari before a female flight attendant finally succeeded in quieting him, Oerding said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent Mark White, based in Dallas, said the event did not appear to be an act of terrorism. He described Shahsavari as a U.S. citizen who might have experienced an episode of mental illness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounded like he sort of lost control of himself,&#8221; White said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>TSA agents removed Shahsavari&rsquo;s luggage from the plane, searched it and turned it over to his unidentified sister, who was traveling with him, Neufeld said.</p>
<p>The sister stayed in Amarillo overnight, Neufeld said. He said there was a language barrier for investigators attempting to interview Shahsavari, who is of Iranian descent. Shahsavari was born in Mississippi, Neufeld said.</p>

<p>WHY is there a &#8220;language barrier&#8221; for ANY person born and raised in the United States? What possible excuse can there be?<br>

		<p>Shame on AmRen for reporting this story. Don&rsquo;t you know that you are supposed to just submit to jihad, and never complain about it?   We must embrace our joyous &#8220;dhimmitude&#8221; status. The sooner we learn how to love it, the better off we will all be.  Diversity is our strength is just a step in the right direction toward Muslim America.</p>

<p>A Hyatt hotel in Sugar Land, Texas, has abruptly canceled a previously scheduled tea-party event at which author and Atlas Shrugs founder Pamela Geller was scheduled to speak on the dangers of Islam. </p>
<p>Geller said the decision came about because the hotel was &#8220;intimidated&#8221; into censoring her planned speech by &#8220;CAIR thugs,&#8221; referring to the controversial Islamic advocacy group Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p>
<p>She accused the Hyatt Place of enforcing Islamic law, or Shariah, under which no criticism of Islam is allowed. In Muslim nations, it can be a death penalty offense, Geller noted. </p>

		<p>There are so many things wrong with this story that I do not know where to begin.  For one, why is there a language barrier for a man born in Mississippi?  Secondly, why is it OK when a minority &#8220;loses control&#8221; of himself, and endangers others, but heaven forbid a white person whisper even one word of supposed &#8220;racist&#8221; talk, they are ostracized?</p>

		<p>There was an incident once back in the 1980&rsquo;s aboard an Areoflot airliner flying in the former Soviet Union involving two Chechen hijackers we should take note. Some time after hijacking the plane, they made it clear their intention was to blow up the plane in midair, and that was the last mistake they made, Passengers and crew swiftly overwhelmed and disarmed them, then proceeded to land so many punches, kicks and blow that both hijackers were beaten to death, their blood splatter all over the cabin. Spetznaz soldiers were alerted and when the plane came to a halt they stormed the plane where they found the dead hijackers, automatic weapons and explosives and a lot of angry passengers too. What should have happened to this gus was the same thing, I would have attacked him with the goal of killing him had I been on that plane. Time for passengers and crew to fight back against these barbarian Muslims and beat, stomp and kick them until they are dead. </p>

		<p>I see someone on my plane stand up and start yelling Allah Akbar, you&rsquo;ll be met with a vicious ground &amp; pound campaign, no questions asked. I would rain down elbows and heel stomps on some poor Muslim fool, with pleasure. Since 911, I watch and hope for this kind of nonsense to happen on my flight just for the pleasure of a serious Muslim beat down. Don&rsquo;t much care about the consequences, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, they could be the next underwear bomber or shoe bomber. The point is to render a fool like this unconscious for the remainder of the flight in the event he does have explosives. Have yet to experience Muslim trouble on a flight, but if I do, those flying will enjoy the show.</p>

		<p>Born and raised in Mississippi and needs an Iranian translator?<br>
He managed to say you&rsquo;re all going to hell and you&rsquo;re all going to die.  What about the sister?  She doesn&rsquo;t speak English either?</p>
<p>There have been cases when born and raised in America hispanics who did not speak Spanish at all were released with all charges being dropped because the officer who gave them the Miranda warning did not speak to the hispanic in Spanish even though the hispanic did not know Spanish.</p>
<p>If he were a Christian, Baahi, Jewish or Zorastrian Iranian he would not be a pampered minority.  He would be just another man subject to TSA and airline regulations of not interfering with an airline.</p>
<p>But a muslim, hands off, treat him gently.  He could be off his meds.  This behavior is more like that of blacks.  Start an argument for no reason with a passenger then go after the flight attendants.</p>

<p>The only thing I can guess is that his parents took him back home when very young and he did not grow up here.</p>
<p>But wait!  He was still quite capable of yelling &#8220;You&rsquo;re all going to die!&#8221;  So evidently he knew English well enough to make a death threat. Besides, why would he be blaming all the passengers on the plane for a private quarrel with another man?  (I have to assume the other man was another foreigner, or else how could they have understood one another?) Yes, there&rsquo;s a lot unexplained about this story.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s also unexplained is WHY, why, why was this mental case allowed to be here in the first place? And WHY was he allowed to have &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; citizenship?  THAT is something that has to stop!</p>

		<p>Someone needs to explain to me how yelling &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all going to die,&rdquo; on a passenger jet, post 9/11, cannot be consider an act of terrorism! It seems to me this act defines the very essence of what creating terror would be! Ask those passengers on that flight if he succeeded in creating terror though his actions! </p>
<p>Or does terrorism only become a completed act when innocent American are killed in the process! The benefit of the doubt should be given to Americans and not Muslim barbarians!</p>
<p>In any event, I agree with what another poster said. He should have not been able to walk off that flight. </p>

		<p>Ground and pound? That&rsquo;s just for starters, hell he might have swallowed 5 pounds of C4 filled condoms (or had his intestines surgically removed and replaced with even more explosive). The only way to make sure he is not going to detonate would be to quickly open him up and verify the absence of an explosive. It might be bloody but other passengers should help once the risk is explained to them. There is NOTHING stopping a suicidal maniac from blowing a plane out of the sky ANY TIME THEY WANT TO.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

		<p>translated as God is great in Arabic</p>
<p>Notice how this quote or some version of it is always included in terrorist media coverage?  It is a carefully crafted lie designed to instill in whites the idea that we share the same God with islam.  That is a lie.  One that only a handful of muslims actually believe.  Usually, when a muslim expresses this idea, they are practicing some form of Tikrit (warfare via deception).</p>
<p>Muslims worship a form of demonic moon god.  There used to be many of these cults with various demons they worshiped.  All had the same tenant that those that didn&rsquo;t worship their demon were to be put to death.  Well, most of those people are dead.  And islam is the last one left.</p>
<p>Mostly, islam is a modern invention, the Koran having been written hundreds of years after Muhommed died.  It really didn&rsquo;t take on any importance until world war II when Hitler empowered these guys as a method of blocking jewish and british influence in the region.  For some reason, &#8220;denazification&#8221; as an systematic enterprise, although pushed to the limit in europe and japan, was not pursued in the middle east and africa.</p>
<p>Instead, these groups were empowered with tons of US money&hellip;.probably because WWII revealed that, even when outclassed technologically and militarily, what it comes down to is energy.  Run out of gas and your mighty war machine becomes useless and you lose.  Which is how Hitler lost WWII when he could have won.  It came down to gasoline.  And because of that our treatment of the middle east and islam has been insanely self destructive.</p>

		<p>What we need is a permanent ban on Muslim immigration. </p>
<p>From the Social Contract magazine I quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;applicants for admission to the United States do not enjoy the protection of the US Constitution or its 1st Amendment until and unless they are lawfully admitted. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress has plenary power under the Constitution to regulate immigration and determine who can and who cannot be admitted. Congress may bar immigration on any grounds it chooses - including those classes of persons protected by our civil rights laws e.g. race, religion, national origin, sex, age, etc.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yep time for a D.B. Cooper style date with the &#8220;air stair&#8221;, minus the parachute and the money. Just a flight crew installed proximity fused counter charge to make sure he does no damage on the ground. <br>
There is nothing, not TSA gropes or naked body scanners or super sharp affirmative action screeners that is going to detect internal explosives. So once someone is nice enough to identify themselves as a possible &#8220;splodydope&#8221; they should be thanked and dealt with accordingly. </p>

<p>1. He knows English, he simply chose not to speak it when arrested. Cops see this all the time. The joke is, &#8220;how is (an immigrant, insert your favorite one) like a cue ball?&#8221; &#8220;The harder you hit it, the more English you get.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. Because the powers that be know that the worst thing that could happen to their scheme is to have White people band together and act in their own best interests. That scares the daylights out of them. And for those of you who may be having a knee jerk defeatist reaction to what I&rsquo;ve just written, remember this:</p>
<p>Power is never given away, but is always obtained by force from those who have it. Power is only kept by using force against those who would try to take it.</p>
<p>As for the scenario aboard the airliner, Google &#8220;carotid restraint hold&#8221; and you&rsquo;ll never be helpless again. After all, TSA can&rsquo;t cut your arms off before boarding. </p>

<p>The ancient S. Arabs did worship a Moon God, just as the Greeks worshipped a Moon Goddess Dianna.  The European Christian Jesus Christ has many aspects of the old Sun God. The old Europeans also had a Moon God, a God of war and a Mother Goddess.  Apollo was a Sun God.  Before they worshipped G-D ancient Jews worshipped a variety of Gods.</p>
<p>Most people had a supreme God like Zeus, a war God, a Mother and Father nature God, a mechanic God, a hunter God, a Farmer God a Mother Goddess and a Virgin Goddess. </p>
<p>There are still Green Man carvings the ancient Father Nature God all over Britain.</p>
<p>Allah is the one true God.  He is the same as the Jewish G-d and the Christian God the Father of the trinity. The three religions that follow the one true God are just fighting about who are the true followers of God.</p>
<p>All religions have something of the precursor religions in them.</p>
<p>Everybody knows this. So does Islam.</p>
<p>People who are is very anti Islamic because of 9/11 and other things feel that the Moon war God of ancient S. Arabia is the same as Allah. </p>
<p>Atheists laugh at the Christian concept of the Trinity and point out that many of the ancient pagan European religions had 3 Gods in one.  Many scholars point out that Apollo is the son of the Greek God in Chief Zeus.  Perhaps Jesus the Son of the Christian God the Father is similar to Apollo. Maybe the Christians adopted the ancient European Gods.</p>
<p>I doubt that the ancient Moon war God of S. Arabia is behind the 21st century Islamic moves against the Christian west and Jewish Israel.</p>
<p>Some people look at another&rsquo;s religion and see nothing but bad.</p>
<p>All religions have war Gods.  Pre Islamic S. Arabians did have a Moon war God.  They had many Gods, just like the peoples who later became Christians did.</p>
<p>If you want to be anti anything, you can always find something with a bit of truth in that people&rsquo;s history to justify your thinking.</p>

		<p>&#8220;For some reason, &ldquo;denazification&rdquo; as an systematic enterprise, although pushed to the limit in europe and japan, was not pursued in the middle east and africa.&rdquo;&#8221;<br>
 &mdash;  anon. #12</p>
<p><br>
Hitler did make some overtures to Muslims in the English colonies in the middle east. He also made overtures to the Irish victims of 400 years of English colonialism.  He made overtures to  people who lived in the old Province of Brittianey in France.<br>
None of these ever got anywhere.</p>
<p>Supposedly a few Albanian Muslims worked with the Germans in Yugoslavia.  If they did they were completely unimportant. The Mufti of Jerusalem did visit Berlin during WW2.  Perhaps he was annoyed that his city traded Turkish for British imperialism after WW1.  Maybe he didn&rsquo;t like his city and people given as a prize of war.</p>
<p>I really do not want to say anything against anyone&rsquo;s religion.<br>
That Moon God Muslim allies of Hitler in WW2 comes from the Christian Zionist prospective. They could be right.  They could be wrong.</p>
<p>We never pushed denazification in Japan or de anything.  As soon as they surrendered Japan and the US entered into a strong alliance against the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. The US ignored what the Japanese did to the people whose lands they occupied during WW2.<br>
