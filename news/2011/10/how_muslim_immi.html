<h1><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2011/10/16/how-muslim-immigration-has-transformed-european-politics/">How Muslim Immigration Has Transformed European Politics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bruce Bawer, Daily Caller, October 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The mass immigration of Muslims into Western Europe over the last four decades or so was a project of elite mainstream politicians, most of them left-wing, who never consulted the electorate on whether they thought this project was a good idea or not. Motivated by a multicultural sensibility (and, in most cases, an invincible ignorance about Islam), these politicians felt compelled not to try to integrate these newcomers, but encouraged them, rather, to preserve their cultural values, however at odds they might be with Western ideas of freedom and equality. For many years there was little organized public resistance to the increasing Islamization of Europe. But then, around a decade ago, things reached a breaking point.</p>
<p>There were several factors. The enthusiastic response to 9/11 by European Muslims who cheered in the streets that day underscored just how foreign many of these people&rsquo;s values were, and just how hostile they were to the societies in which they lived. The terrorist attacks in Madrid and London, the Danish cartoon riots, the brutal murder of Islam critic Theo van Gogh in Holland, the riots in French and Belgian cities, all raised red flags. European economies suffered increasingly owing to the burden of Muslim families on the welfare state. The growth to adulthood of a generation of European-born Muslims, who had been expected to be fully assimilated, but who, in an extraordinary number of cases, actually proved to be more alienated from mainstream European society than their immigrant parents, was a wake-up call. So were the rising crime rates by these youths, whose religion taught them that unveiled women were legitimate targets for rape and that it was not only acceptable but virtuous to assault Jews, gays, and infidels generally. Furthermore, Europeans became increasingly aware of appalling practices within European Muslim communities, such as forced marriages, female genital mutilation, and honor killings; aware of the vicious anti-Western preaching of these communities&rsquo; imams; and aware that these communities, as they grew, were becoming insular no-go zones governed not by Western law but by Sharia.</p>
<p>Yet while ordinary Europeans  &mdash;  many of whose lives were strongly affected by these developments  &mdash;  became more concerned about them, government leaders (whose own lives were largely insulated from these grim realities) dragged their heels, loath to criticize Islam, to make demands of immigrants, or to admit the failure of the multicultural project. The result was a rise in the popularity of organizations, politicians, and parties (some of them newly minted parties) that dared to question the wisdom of existing immigration and integration policies. Some of these new movements had their roots, at least in part, in traditional European fascism and nativism, and were, to say the least, not entirely positive developments; others stood up to Islamization in the name of secular society and individual liberty. Generally speaking, the consequence was a clear rightward shift in European politics. A dramatic example of the way in which concern about European Islam led to a political upheaval was in Denmark, where a sensational 2001 report predicting catastrophic long-term effects of Muslim immigration in that country led voters to replace the socialists who had dominated Danish politics for decades with a conservative coalition led by Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who proceeded (as promised) to institute the most revolutionary immigration and integration reforms in Western Europe. (Alas, in the recent Danish election the socialists were returned to power; they plan to water down Fogh&rsquo;s reforms.)</p>
<p>Concerns about European Islam played at least some role in the installation of conservative governments in Britain, France, and Germany, where over the last couple of years the heads of government, David Cameron, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Angela Merkel respectively, have pronounced multiculturalism a failure  &mdash;  something one could not have imagined happening just a few years ago. In Norway, concern about Islam was a key factor in the rise of the Progress Party, which at its peak a couple of years ago rivaled the long-dominant Labor Party as the largest of the country&rsquo;s seven or eight major parties (though in the wake of the July 22 murder spree by an anti-immigrant lunatic its clout has slipped significantly). Concern about Islam has fueled the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant Vlaams Bloc, now Vlaams Belang, in Belgium and the Sweden Democrats in Sweden, and has helped keep Silvio Berlusconi&rsquo;s Forza Italia in power. Perhaps most spectacularly, it has also fed the immense popularity of the valiant Dutch politician Geert Wilders, who has placed the curbing of his country&rsquo;s Islamization at the center of his political platform and whose very considerable influence extends far beyond his tiny country.</p>
<p>A major outlier in all this is Spain, where the 2004 Madrid bombings, supposedly motivated by the presence of Spanish troops in Iraq, actually tipped the elections a couple of days later toward the Socialists, who promised to withdraw those troops (and did). But that exception aside, the development across Europe has been striking. A decade ago, America had a conservative president and Western Europe was governed mostly by left-wing parties; today the opposite is the case. Less striking, alas, have been the policy repercussions of this political sea change. While there have been positive reforms in immigration and integration policies in Denmark and the Netherlands, and scattered policy changes elsewhere (the burqa ban in France, the minaret ban in Switzerland), these new governments have fallen short of taking the kind of action that is necessary to ensure the survival of European freedom and equality in the face of an Islamization that is still proceeding apace. The recent news that there are hundreds of would-be terrorists in the U.K. waiting in line to wreak havoc at the forthcoming London Olympics only underscored just how far Europe has to go to protect itself from homegrown jihad  &mdash;  whether of the violent or of the stealth variety.</p>

		<p>Such a shame.</p>
<p>Before the surly, primitive, alien baby factories flooded once fair Europe&hellip;</p>
<p>They had some pretty functional mixed market/social democracies.  </p>
<p>But between the subsaharan Africans and the medievalist Muslims, both breeding like flies, the blacks possessed of significantly lower IQ&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>
<p>Stupid dippy brave-new-worlder lefties really hung themselves with their own ideology.  And their civilization too&hellip;</p>
<p>Yeah&hellip;Blow one to once fair Europe - WW1/2 and the greatest mass murderer of white people in history, Hitler.  Score one for the right!  Blow two - a haymaker from the histrionic left bent on suicidally proving how non-racist they were.</p>
<p>But millions of Europeans are waking up to see the lie for what it is.  Hope its not too late.</p>

		<p>I see no reason why European or Western countries should allow immigration at all except amongst themselves, or in the rare case of a citizen&rsquo;s marriage or that of a particular scientist&rsquo;s talent.</p>
<p>There will be even more pressure for third world immigrants to flood first world nations as their populations continues to explode and their countries remain in a mess.</p>
<p>Time to shut the door.</p>

		<p>The purpose of the bombing by Timothy MC Viegh would seem to be to discredit the right wing which it did as many growing groups of right wing people fell apart due to moral issues clouding things.  In one strike a near mortal blow was struck to the right wing.  the bombing victims were collateral damage expendable to the power brokers as unimportant except for the propaganda value they provided.  the same applies to the Norway killings.  mc Viegh was an agent in a larger organization playing a power game  as in America so in Europe the right has become demoralized as small people are killed to provide propaganda for the left.  the people killed have no value beyond the propaganda they provide in a global power game that wants European white peoples breed out of existence  The white race is dying in Europe and in America and in Australia.  Unless white people get on the ball and fight back to survive as a folk we are doomed to die out for ever.</p>

		<p>I agree fully with the points made in the article, but I do insist on splitting one small hair. The Muslim problem in Europe is strictly confined to one half of it - Western Europe. The relative prosperity, comically generous welfare states and lack of cultural confidence are what has got them to the trouble they are in (in fairness, I must point out that Ireland and Portugal are the two exceptions). I live in Poland and I can assure you that the lessons of the experiences of the other half of the continent have been learned. Ditto for Czech Rep, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria &amp; all the little leftover chunks of Yugoslavia. I know that very often in the American mind, Europe stops at Germany but I assure you it does not. Talk to any one of the millions of Poles who have gone to work in Western Europe and they will tell you that they would NEVER want their own country to end up with the Muslim problems like they witnessed there. It&rsquo;s too late for places like the UK, France and Holland but they at least now other European countries have fair warning. </p>

A very good news you give us here.<br>
Here in France, François Hollande, the Socialist candidate for the presidency in Spring 2012, in a very good position to win, just promised to apply the program of his party and to give to citizens of non-EU countries the right to vote on the local elections. We follow the American example : the more problems there are with some people, the more we give them rights and money. It seems from this that the best solution by far is preventive : don&rsquo;t let them come in.      </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never understood why Europe has ever needed ANY immigrants at all. Europe is a small and densely crowded continent. It has no history or tradition of immigration. It has historically always been racially homogeneous. It has never made any sense to me. I suspect the real reason was the wish of Euro-elites to weaken nationalist feelings to create their E.U. super-state monstrousity. </p>

<p>Oh no. It&rsquo;s not just the Orthodox Slavs who had to fight against the Muslim Turks at all.  It was also the Orthodox Greeks and Romanians as well as the Catholic Venetians, Hungarians and Slavs (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Croats) who all fought and pushed the Ottomans back.  Last time I checked, the Ottomans marched all the way to Vienna in 1683, and we sure can thank the Catholics and Protestants of the Holy Roman Empire for stopping a complete invasion of Europe.  We were always fighting &#8220;together&#8221; against the Ottoman Empire, and the Orthodox Slavs haven&rsquo;t done anything more, especially when they were quickly defeated and occupied by the Turks for centuries in the Balkans. It&rsquo;s 2011, and it&rsquo;s time to snap out of the local mythology and folklore already!<br>

		<p>1000 years is fair and I really should&rsquo;ve included all Orthodox Balkan people who alone fought off Muslim hoards 800AD-1400AD. Austria alone fought them consistently for just 250 years afterward and it was largely Serbs who secured the old Military Frontier along the present Bosnian border that kept W.Europe free from Islam until now while the Balkan states each fought  Turks in wars of independence from 1804-1912 and Russia fought off Turks, Tartars &amp; Teutons since 1200AD. The West had it easy.</p>

		<p>And let&rsquo;s be honest: Austria is not the entire West. Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Great Britain, France, Italy America, Australia, Canada &amp; Poland didn&rsquo;t fight defensive wars against the Caliphate &amp; Sultanate. All respect to Iberians, Austrians &amp; Hungarians but their fight was short &amp; sweet and not having a constant longterm evil enemy to keep you on your toes did make the West weak &amp; liberal, hence the most ethnocentric Europeans live on the Muslim frontier.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t wish to quibble with you, as I essentially agree,  but that&rsquo;s not the WHOLE story.</p>
<p>Holland  and other states were very willing to trade and  supply miliary goods to the Ottomans.  And France had a long alliance with Turkey ever since about 1520.  France was more interested in doing harm to Germany than they were concerned about containing Turkey. They even allowed the Turks to use French ports as military bases! </p>
<p>Europe was never allied in its resistance to Islam.  Unfortunately, their most common policy policy was to rejoice in their neighbor&rsquo;s ruin.  </p>

		<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget the role of Austria-Hungary in propping up independent Albania at the expense of Greece &amp; Serbia in 1912 and its academia&rsquo;s role in legitimizing the Illyrian theory of Albanian ethnogenesis despite evidence of a medieval Albanian migration from the Caucasus not to mention the fact that the Third Reich, of which Austria was an enthusiastic member, was pan-Islamist &amp; pan-Turkic recruiting Balkan &amp; Soviet Muslims against Orthodox Slavs with the blessing of the Catholic Vatican.</p>
