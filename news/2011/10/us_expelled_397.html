<h1>US Expelled 397,000 Undocumented Migrants in Year</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>US authorities deported 397,000 undocumented immigrants, of which 210,000 had criminal records in the fiscal year just concluded, the top immigration enforcer told lawmakers Wednesday.</p>
<p>John Morton, director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), offered the figure at a congressional hearing, which would outpace the records of 390,000 illegals and 195,000 with criminal records in the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the face of questions about the administration&rsquo;s toughness on immigration, Morton said ICE had held some 25,000 hearings for businesses suspected of hiring illegals, and had arrested 217 employers along with 15,000 undocumented workers, and had imposed $6 million in fines in the fiscal year ended September 30.</p>
<p>Committee chairman Lamar Smith told the hearing, however, that the administration &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t often take enforcement of ICE&rsquo;s immigration laws seriously enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith said the claim that ICE is focusing on priority cases is &#8220;just a slick way of saying they don&rsquo;t want to enforce immigration laws. ICE has shown little interest in actually deporting illegal immigrants who have not yet been convicted of what they call &#8216;serious&rsquo; crimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a bid to remake the enforcement of federal immigration laws, the Obama administration is deporting record numbers of illegal immigrants and auditing hundreds of businesses that blithely hire undocumented workers. <br>
  <br>
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency expects to deport about 400,000 people this fiscal year, nearly 10 percent above the Bush administration&rsquo;s 2008 total and 25 percent more than were deported in 2007. The pace of company audits has roughly quadrupled since President George W. Bush&rsquo;s final year in office. </p>

		<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA EXPLAINS TO A LATINO AUDIENCE WHY THE HIGH DEPORTATION NUMBERS ARE &#8220;ACTUALLY A LITTLE DECEPTIVE&#8221; (his words):</p>
<p><br>
President Obama entertained questions from what was called a &ldquo;U.S. Hispanic audience&rdquo; Wednesday during an online roundtable moderated by Jose Siade of Yahoo Espanol, Karine Medina of MSN Latino, Gabriel Lerner of AOL Latino and Huff-Post Latino Voices. (CNN, Sept. 28, 2011) &hellip; one of the first questions asked of Obama was why has his Administration deported more illegal aliens than those before him. In an attempt to deflect this criticism, he argued the deportation statistics are misleading and acknowledged that he has virtually stopped interior enforcement of our immigration laws. He said, &ldquo;[T]he statistics are actually a little deceptive because what we&rsquo;ve been doing is&hellip;apprehending folks at the borders and sending them back. That is counted as a deportation, even though they may have only been held for a day or 48 hours.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Charlotte group helping illegal immigrants get licenses by <br>
 <br>
CHARLOTTE, N.C. – According to the latest census, there are more than a half million undocumented immigrants living and working in North Carolina. Right now, they&rsquo;re not allowed to get a driver&rsquo;s license, but a local group is hoping to change that soon.</p>
<p>Maudia Melendez works with Jesus Ministry and is an advocate for immigrants, but after living in North Carolina for 25 years she&rsquo;s also an advocate for the state, which is why she is behind the Drivers Licenses for Undocumented Immigrants project. </p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have something that benefits everybody,&#8221; said Melendez.  &#8220;We&rsquo;re going to know who is driving out there, who has a license.&#8221;<br>
 <br>
Melendez says her group plans to petition for thousands of signatures in North Carolina and present reasons in favor. She says with an estimated more than 500 million undocumented immigrants who live and work in the state, charging them $50 for a license plus other costs would generate nearly $100 million.<br>
  <br>
But not everyone is on board. NewsChannel 36 spoke with a representative for Americans for Legal Immigration who says giving undocumented immigrants licenses is promoting illegal immigration, and some Americans agree.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think if you&rsquo;re undocumented or in that illegal status that you should be allowed those privileges,&#8221; said Al White.<br>
 <br>
Politics aside, AAA Carolinas says the more drivers with licenses the better for other drivers.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Unlicensed drivers also means uninsured drivers, so if you get in an accident with one of these folks, you&rsquo;re held accountable for the financial considerations of that accident,&#8221; said Tom Sullivan with AAA Carolinas.<br>
 <br>
Melendez says they&rsquo;ll argue their case as far up as they need to go.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s not so much about the immigrants, it&rsquo;s about also us looking for this state,&#8221; she added.</p>

		<p>Were these 397,000 criminal illegals really deported in the physical sense, or were they &#8220;deported&#8221; in the sense that the Federal government began the legal proceedings to deport them?  Obviously, there are many hurdles between that and real deportation, which result in real deportation not happening in most cases.</p>

<p>More Numbers On Obama And The Treason Lobby In The DHS Stopping Worksite Raids</p>
<p>By James Fulford on July 26, 2010 </p>
<p>We have more numbers to verify something Ed Rubenstein wrote on June 21 that</p>
<p>Rosemary Jenks, NumbersUSA Director of Government Relations, implicitly provides what may be the best explanation:</p>
<p>It is incredibly hypocritical for the President to talk about holding employers accountable when his DHS has basically stopped criminal prosecutions of employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens and has completely stopped worksite raids, and when his Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to overturn Arizona&rsquo;s E-Verify law. If Obama Has Stepped Up Enforcement, Why Suppress The Numbers?]</p>
<p>We emailed Rosemary Jenks, and she wrote that there are</p>
<p>&#8220;statistics from ICE that show that criminal prosecutions of employers have plummeted under Obama,&#8221;</p>
<p>These statistics haven&rsquo;t been published yet, but they&rsquo;re available to Congress. We checked with a staffer on the House Judiciary Committee, and she&rsquo;s right  &mdash;  he reports that:</p>
<p>&#8220;In worksite enforcement cases, the latest stats through May show that administrative arrests (typically just employees but could include employers if they themselves were illegal) are down 81% from 2008, criminal arrests (employers and employees for criminal charges) are down 67%, indictments (employers and employees for criminal charges) are down 73% and convictions (employers and employees for criminal charges) are down 75%.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthmore, Jenks said</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the halting of worksite raids, I was on a conference call with Esther Olavarria, who is the policy director for DHS (and former Kennedy staffer), during which she said specifically that they have stopped worksite raids as of May 2009 and that their goal is &#8220;to arrest as few undocumented workers as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>US Expelled 397,000 Undocumented Migrants In Year</p>
<p>By Federale on October 13, 2011 </p>
<p>John Morton, head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has repeatedly stated that ICE has the budget to only deport 400,000 aliens each Fiscal Year (FY). ICE, however, consistently fails to reach that goal, sometimes despite desperate efforts. The Obama Regime has failed in each FY and FY 2011 is no exception:</p>
<p>AFP October 13, 2011</p>
<p>US Expelled 397,000 Undocumented Migrants In Year</p>
<p>WASHINGTON  &mdash;  US authorities deported 397,000 undocumented immigrants, of which 210,000 had criminal records in the fiscal year just concluded, the top immigration enforcer told lawmakers Wednesday.</p>
<p>John Morton, director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), offered the figure at a congressional hearing, which would outpace the records of 390,000 illegals and 195,000 with criminal records in the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The numbers are quite strong,&#8221; he told the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Morton said that with &#8220;limited resources,&#8221; his agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, is focusing on &#8220;priority&#8221; cases   &mdash;   including those who pose dangers to public safety or who are fugitives from justice.</p>
<p>Also in this category are persons crossing the border from Mexico, in some cases returning after being sent back.</p>
<p>In the face of questions about the administration&rsquo;s toughness on immigration, Morton said ICE had held some 25,000 hearings for businesses suspected of hiring illegals, and had arrested 217 employers along with 15,000 undocumented workers, and had imposed $6 million in fines in the fiscal year ended September 30.</p>
<p>Committee chairman Lamar Smith told the hearing, however, that the administration &#8220;doesn&rsquo;t often take enforcement of ICE&rsquo;s immigration laws seriously enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>He argued that officials &#8220;intentionally allowed illegal immigrants to remain in the United States&#8221; by using &#8220;backdoor amnesty through administrative action even if it can&rsquo;t get congressional approval.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith said the claim that ICE is focusing on priority cases is &#8220;just a slick way of saying they don&rsquo;t want to enforce immigration laws. ICE has shown little interest in actually deporting illegal immigrants who have not yet been convicted of what they call &#8216;serious&rsquo; crimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>From FY 2010, the total increase in deportations, if one accepts the 397,000 number, and that is a big if, it is suspiciously round for the number of removals, is only 4,138 aliens. Not much of an achievement. And such round numbers like that just don&rsquo;t look like government statistics. And it by necessity included suspicously large increases of deportations for August and September FY 2011 as has been shown. Removals by ICE in FY 2011 have been decreasing since April FY 2011, then suddenly increased in the last two months of the fiscal year. Also of interest is that the increase in FY 2010 deportations was only 3,028 illegal aliens from FY 2009.</p>
<p>More importantly, it appears that ICE is continuing to refuse to use expedited removal against criminal aliens. It is still using the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to remove criminal aliens, which is a slow and expensive process. About $12,000.00 per alien expensive. But it is much cheaper and faster to use expedited removal to remove criminal aliens, but the Obama Regime continues to refuse to use expedited removal. It would rather deport fewer criminal aliens at a greater cost than to remove more illegal aliens at a lower cost. It is playing a game with the ultimate goal of allowing criminal and other aliens to remain.</p>
<p>ICE has yet to release the full breakdown of removals per month in FY 2011, it still has only ten months of figures for FY 2011 on its website. So we won&rsquo;t know how they supposedly increased deportations in FY 2011 in the last two months. To reach the 397,000 number for FY 2011, they would have had to remove 36,140.5 illegal aliens for August and September FY 2011. Still a huge increase over June and July FY 2011 which were 34,043 and 29,096 respectively.</p>
<p>At best ICE still failed to reach its claim that it has the budget to deport 400,000 illegal aliens and only managed to increase the numbers it deported by 4,000. Not much of an achievement and clearly using deliberately low expectations of its potential.</p>
<p>It is certain that the number of aliens deported have been falsified or manipulated. We await the details in the deportation numbers. It is in the details we will catch the conscience of the king&hellip;</p>

		<p>Well, for staters I would consider illegally sneaking into a country, purposely milking that government for every freebie, exploiting &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; loopholes, displacing &#8220;true&#8221; American citizens both socially and economicaly, and generally thumbing their noses at the rule of law&hellip;..serious crimes. They are serious enough to be causing severe damage to our country on many many levels. The money these hordes of invaders are costing the taxpayers, it is simpy not sustainable.<br>
We need to build a practical wall or fortification now. Forget the cost, lets get real Americans working on it, like a Hoover Dam project to get things moving forward again. And lets pull our troops out of every other country and park them along the border to cover our work brigades. Operation Lockdown. I can live with a costly government project on that scale a lot more than I can stomach those same funds going into supporting these parasites year after year after year. At least a wall would reduce the numbers coming in, instead of motivating more and more to come to get free college, health care, etc etc etc&hellip;..Enough is enough.<br>
I have said it a hundred times, you don&rsquo;t try and bail water while there is a hole in your boat. Plug the hole, stop the influx, then and only then can we focus on getting the water out of the boat. If not, we will sink fast. We are well on our way.</p>

		<p>IF this article was true,(which it isn&rsquo;t) do you not think Obama, DHS and his co-horts would have videos plastered all over TV of all these hundreds of thousands GOING back to Mexico to show the American people how &#8220;tough&#8221; he is on the border issue?

Mexican President Says US Deportations Feed Violence in Mexico<br>
Tuesday, October 18, 2011 3:46:49 PM · by SwinneySwitch · 56 replies <br>
FOX NEWS Latino ^ | Oct. 18, 2011</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon on Monday accused U.S. authorities of deporting Mexican criminals to save on judicial costs, a policy that ostensibly &#8220;exacerbates&#8221; violence. </p>
<p>Within the framework of the inauguration of National Immigration Week 2011 in this capital, Calderon said that, for example, U.S. authorities &#8220;are deporting up to 80,000 people in a year&#8221; into the border cities of Reynosa and Ciudad Juarez. Some of these deported people &#8220;are migrants, certainly, probably all of them,&#8221; although some were &#8220;already involved in criminal acts&#8221; in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing new in this, for hundreds of years Europe dumped its criminals on America.</p>
