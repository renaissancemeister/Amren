<p>Can you explain to me how or why our diversity is our strength, without giving me a half-baked answer that merely defines diversity?  (Which is what most people to whom this question is asked wind up doing).</p>

		<p>I get this mag free because I teach in an urban area.  You would NOT believe how leftist, brain-washing and outright insane this mag is!  Kumbaya!  All whites are racists!  All &#8216;people of color&rsquo; are noble, good and misunderstood due to evil white privilege!  This mag has a very wide circulation, by the way.</p>
<p>One article a while back was how a teacher was trying to teach small children that race does not exist.  </p>
<p>She showed the kids in a class pics of different racial groups and asked which one was &#8216;the American.&rsquo;  Predictably they all picked the white kid pic.  </p>
<p>The teacher then held up the pic of a Chinese kid and said what is he?  The kids said, &#8220;Chinese,&#8221; and the teacher said how do you know that?  The kids said because the pic looked like a Chinese guy.  Then the teacher asked what is a Chinese person supposed to look like?  How do you know?  When the kids explained, she pounced on them and tore down their logic.  The article reported with glee how the teacher proceeded to tear down any ability of the kids to describe the race or ethnicity of another person.  </p>
<p>It was truly mind-boggling and smacked of re-education camp. </p>

		<p>Now that many European countries have declared multiculturalism a failure and dead, how would the SPLC revise diversity teaching in the schools of those countries? Curricula have to reflect government policy so there must be revision. A further question would ask what kind of remedial education is needed for all the citizens who have been taught incorrectly in the past. Government has an obligation to assist citizens who might suffer from acting on incorrect education. </p>

		<p>It is a severe tactical error merely to disavow what $PLC is<br>
doing.  Mandatory schooling laws and practical economic realities, make it necessary for students to be thrown together up through middle school at least.  The issue is sifting out the explicit and implicit fallacies of the $PLC approach and replacing them with what  currently are the relevant facts of science.  A workable &#8220;tolerance&#8221; program, for example, probably would amount in many schools (as it has evolved unaided by $PLC in some prisons ) to a large degree of self-segregation and an identification of those persons from among blacks and whites, who are able to communicate with &#8220;the other side&#8221; to lose/lose conflicts.   </p>

		<p>If I think diversity is a dysfunctional agenda, shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to say it&hellip;after all, the SPLC loves diversity right?  And my opinion is diverse&hellip;so&hellip;?  Oh never mind, they just like to say the word &#8220;diversity&#8221; while forcing everyone to think exactly the same way.  Got it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The issue is not the intent of the artist, but the effect the symbol has on the other students. It&rsquo;s pretty common, in my experience, for those with privileges to feel defensive about and vigorously defend those privileges when someone criticizes them, even when the privilege hurts/offends other people.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is a great point. However, what have you said when people when they have asked for you to totally dismantle your own personal privilege that you have benefited from and give anything that can be transferred to those who are less fortunate, thereby leading by example (rather then espousing hypocrisy)?</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Here are what some of my students have asked. I have VERY smart students (slightly rephrased).</p>
<p>&#8220;How can one celebrate diversity if we are all the same?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to have tolerance, doesn&rsquo;t one need to &#8216;tolerate&rsquo; some thought, behavior, or action, even though he or she may not deem it appropriate. Being offended isn&rsquo;t a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been accused of being focused on the white students only in my class and alluding that anyone who is white is automatically racist (such as the confederate flag). What would you say?</p>

		<p>Re 01, 07<br>
Many abler Blacks ( in a society that has to rely on its relatively few natural leaders ) disdain diversity.  One said<br>
to me several decades ago, &#8220;We&rsquo;re as racist as you people are.&#8221;<br>
The coerced social mixing in contemporary schools, if properly<br>
looked at, could be for both groups a real laboratory in the wisdoms of separatism.  The $PLC materials and programs can be stood on their head and used productively, once the facts of science can supplant the hokey promises and fakey optimism that<br>
Dee$ peddle$.  </p>

		<p>Government reports show that out-of-wedlock births are much higher for some groups than others. Studies show children growing up in single-parent homes are much more likely to drop out of high school, end up in jail, etc. If our goal is to advance the common good and social justice, should we expose and address these differences and the reasons for them? Instead, should we ignore the differences because addressing the truth might hurt the self-esteem of students and poke large holes in the nonsense liberal educators are feeding our children?</p>

<p>Interesting ideas.</p>
<p>I believe you are taking diversity with different context and then reapplying them to sociology (with the belief of co habitation without conflict is possible).</p>
<p>But in the context of race, then you are implying that certain groups have different cultural experience (or are we talking about bio diversity among different groups of people which many subconscious argue without realizing it) that solely belong to that group. If culture is a social construct with no arbitrary connection to race then it can&rsquo;t be used (example some people who may defy some racial cultural norm).</p>
<p>Numerous historical examples of the late Roman Empire, current Iraq war, Czechoslovakia, and even of course the far left Soviet Union regime all had diversity (which failed). In fact I don&rsquo;t know of a single war where diversity isn&rsquo;t the culprit (whether between nations or within). Even civil wars are ultimately caused by some divergence in a once mono culture that no longer see eye to eye.</p>
<p>There are some enriching factors of diversity that could be argued (as there is); however, the irony (which I seem to be the only on here who has so far pointed out) is that if diversity is such a strength the clearly it would be self evident and this forum would not need to exist (where [diverse] teachers need to submit a diverse form of questions from a diverse form of student body who have a diverse view opposing the teacher and this website [which ironically doesn&rsquo;t welcomes &#8220;all&#8221; diversity], wants everyone to adopt the ideology of &#8220;diversity&#8221; which paradoxically becomes a strict ideology of sameness).</p>
<p>Very interesting discussion indeed, but it would be rude of me to hog the floor.</p>
<p>This is just one diverse view.</p>

		<p>Oh yes, tolerance.  Except when you don&rsquo;t toe the line, after all, war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength!</p>
<p>If people really want to be tolerant, perhaps they shouldn&rsquo;t be intolerant of people having thoughts, ideas, and beliefs that don&rsquo;t agree with theirs.</p>

		<p>The first, best, last and only argument for diversity: a diversity of ideas can bring ideas to the fore which might not have been proposed without diversity, and possibly those ideas are better, and maybe the better ideas will win out.</p>
<p>Can, might, possibly, maybe.  That&rsquo;s as good as diversity gets.</p>

		<p>What we are told: Whites are an INFERIOR race, oppressing the hapless non-white victims.<br>
What we observe: The &#8216;victims&rsquo; want integration, not segregation. They want immigration, not emigration. They follow the white man wherever he goes. There are many non-white places to live, but no all-white places left.<br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the one &#8220;culture&#8221; that excels in criminalizing &#8220;free speech&#8221;, free thought&#8221; and &#8220;freedom of association&#8221;.  This &#8220;culture is behind the $PLC, ADL, AIPAC and other anti-freedom organizations and has successfully made ANY question of the &#8220;holocaust&#8221; a CRIME in Europe.  The &#8220;holocaust&#8221;, being a historical event needs to be looked in to for assurance that the TRUTH can be separated from the propaganda.  Most people do not realize that a certain &#8220;group&#8221; within the &#8220;culture&#8221; wanted to encourage emigration to a &#8220;homeland&#8221;.  As most people of the &#8220;culture&#8221; led relatively comfortable and prosperous lives, emigration to what was then a undeveloped land was &#8220;out of the question&#8221;.  A way was needed to &#8220;encourage&#8221; emigration to this undeveloped land.  The &#8220;group&#8221; within the &#8220;culture&#8221; needed to make life difficult for it&rsquo;s &#8220;culture&#8221;.  This group instituted &#8220;boycotts&#8221; and &#8220;civil unrest&#8221; which tore apart their country &hellip; the &#8220;holocaust&#8221; was the result &hellip; This behavior by the &#8220;group&#8221; in no way justified the &#8220;holocaust&#8221;; the &#8220;holocaust&#8221; ended up destroying the country in question.  What most people do not realize (and will NEVER admit, despite factual evidence to the contrary) is that this &#8220;group&#8221; COLLABORATED with those who instituted the &#8220;holocaust&#8221;.  This information is NOT ALLOWED to be discussed in the country in question or the surrounding countries.  Fines and imprisonment are the result for ANYONE who fails to &#8220;toe the line&#8221; and accept the conventional orthodoxy of the &#8220;holocaust&#8221;. By no means is this screed intended to minimize the great suffering that occured during this horrible event.  The TRUTH must be paramount &hellip; the TRUTH of the &#8220;holocaust&#8221; must be bared for all to know &hellip; those who criminalize ANY discussion of this event seem to have &#8220;something to hide&#8221;. The old Sanataya quote: &#8220;those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it applies doubly here &hellip;  Baring all will expose some skeletons that some of the &#8220;group&#8221; do not want revealed, but as I previously said, the TRUTH must prevail &hellip; Discussion does not trivialize this event, rather it reinforces the horrors of the event &hellip; if needed I can provide credible sources to PROVE my assertations to anyone who requests &hellip;</p>

<p>It is something like a big strong gander opening the gate of the poultry yard so the weasels and foxes can devour the chickens.<br>
After the chickens are destroyed the foxes and weasels won&rsquo;t leave, they will just devour the geese and the biggest strongest gander won&rsquo;t be able to stop them.</p>
