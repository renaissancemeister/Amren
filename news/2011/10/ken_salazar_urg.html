			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ed O&rsquo;Keefe, Washington Post, October 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the nation&rsquo;s Latino population booming and now the country&rsquo;s largest minority group, the Obama administration&rsquo;s top Hispanic official is concerned that the federal government is not giving enough attention to Hispanic history and culture.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Ken Salazar in the past year has pushed the National Park Service to identify more sites or properties related to the histories of women and minorities that could be added to the National Register of Historic Places or be preserved as national parks or historic landmarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than 3â€‰percent of all the national landmarks that we have  &mdash;  the highest designation you can receive as a historic landmark  &mdash;  are designated for women, Latinos, African Americans or other members of minority groups,&#8221; Salazar said in a meeting with reporters last week. &#8220;That tells you that the score is not even.&#8221;</p>
<p>The secretary&rsquo;s concerns will be one of several issues discussed at White House meetings on Latino heritage scheduled for Wednesday. The meetings, set to bring together a who&rsquo;s who of Latino business, political, religious and entertainment leaders, are slated to focus on whether the government is properly serving Hispanic students, small business owners, military veterans and artists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when you look at the way Americans most understand the history of Latinos in this country, a lot of it is being told now through the lens of what&rsquo;s happening with the immigration debate,&#8221; Salazar said last week at a meeting hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. &#8220;While that&rsquo;s an important debate that has security and moral implications, in my view, there&rsquo;s also a huge history of Latinos in the United States that&rsquo;s never been told.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most ambitious attempt to date to memorialize Latino history will come with construction of the National Museum of the American Latino, whose planning commission is pushing to build on a site near the U.S. Capitol. The project would cost about $600 million and be financed with a mix of private and federal dollars.</p>

		<p>The trouble is that such museums will be filled with the achievements and stories of latinos who got off the boat (or crossed the border) within the last 20 years.  They will give the false impression that George Washington commanded an army of mexicans, or that Dominicans helped to clear the forests of the midwest, or that ecuadorians were at Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>There is not much &#8216;real&rsquo; &#8216;latino&rsquo; history in the land before 20-30 years ago, and a bunch of mostly white spaniard hacienda owners who assimilated into white american culture long ago does not equal dominicans or mexican indians in this land.</p>

		<p>I for one have no interest whatever in hearing about Latino cultural &#8220;achievements,&#8221; such as they are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be most interested in hearing of any scientific, medical, industrial, engineering, educational, agricultural, aerospace, or architectural achievements.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve harbor no particular animus toward Latinos or anybody else, but I strenuously object to the false attribution of great achievements to any group, be they black, Latinos, WASPs, or Italians.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re deep within the greatest recession in the history of the country, with experts throughout the world warning of another worse one, while MANY are telling us we&rsquo;re headed for total collapse, and a &#8220;minority&#8221; representative&rsquo;s greatest concern is in naming something after his tribe.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t that typical of them?  They&rsquo;re so fanatically dedicated to pursuing aims exclusive to their own tribes it doesn&rsquo;t matter that Rome is burning.</p>

		<p>THis is good. The more Hispanic Parks and Black Parks the better.</p>
<p><br>
Why? Maybe us whites can go to parks for us racists whites and be left alone in peace. No rap garbage, no smell of tacos, no rapes or gun killings.</p>

		<p>I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Salazar. Start in LA, Las Vegas, Denver, San Diego, Dallas, Houston (heck all of Texas), Oklahoma City, Chicago, Miami, New York, Philly, Boston, Cleveland and Detroit. Anywhere that there is black vs brown gang wars going on. Those should be designated as national landmarks for Latinos. Maybe Phoenix can be the capital of these turf wars. Maybe a little plaque bronzed to let everybody know that the &#8220;Battle of Compton&#8221; took place right here. Lil&rsquo; Flaco fought against Ray-Ray and C Dubs for control of the cocaine trade. Many lives were lost, and others were clothed, fed and locked in cages paid for by the working White man. His last days are the next exhibit we will see. There are only about 1,000 left in designated safe havens. They had a heck of a run, ye olde Whites. But they never shared a sense of solidarity, and gave away so much of their achievements, they weren&rsquo;t meant to keep it. Suckerz! I think that&rsquo;s what many historic sites could look like in the not-so-distant future.</p>

What you will find is that Ken Salazar can trace his ancestory all the way back to 12th Century Spain!! How exactly does this make him a member of a &#8220;minority&#8221; group. Racially he is white. I guess he just wants to mooch off the perverse system of set asides based on &#8220;race&#8221; that this country has.</p>

Some years back, a co-worker spent the day at a state park. What should have been a day of enjoying the tranquility of nature was ruined by the Hispanics &#8216;blasting their music&rsquo; as she put it.</p>

		<p>Anyone who thinks Mexicans are better than blacks when it comes to their own anti-White agenda (racism), better think again. The same goes for Asiatic peoples. They are ALL against us and our nations and if ALL Whites do not stand up and attack these enemies and expel them from their nations, we all know what happens next.</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t need any because they have assimilated into being Americans first and foremost. The more we cater to identifying these so-called &#8220;victims&#8221; of society the more we grow separate from them.

		<p>Heard one of these radio PSAs about the need to &#8220;preserve national parks.&#8221;  The announcer, some celeb, ran down a laundry list of various dangers that NPs are facing.  When he said each one, I said out loud, &#8220;Mexican drug gangs growing pot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems to me that in certain NPs, there is already a lot of &#8220;Latino themes.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Hispanics have made our national parks into dangerous no go zones, many of which are national landmarks or treasures.  They have done so by invading them for their growing operations.  So of course we should now consider establishing national landmarks for hispanics.  How about we make that sign on the border warning citizens that part of their State is now too dangerous to enter?  Let&rsquo;s make THAT a national landmark with an historic sign explaining how this condition was brought to you by our beloved neighbors to the south.  Mark the plaque as &#8220;First Territory Regained in the Re-Conquistada&#8221;  or whatever the spanish word is for conquered territory.  </p>

		<p>Even as you are reading this, federal, state and local forces are at work detecting and destroying historic marijuana plantations, every one established and maintained by Latinos, in national parks and on other federal property all over the failed State of California. Afterwards, racist white gangs of volunteers descend on these symbols of Latino empowerment and utterly obliterate them, restoring the land to its natural state. Mr. Salazar has made me realize how important it is to preserve these culturally significant and enriching sites.</p>

		<p>Three percent designated for minorities? Sounds about right if we&rsquo;re talking about places and landmarks important enough to receive federal recognition.

		<p>Being that Hispanics are mostly a mixture of Spanish and indigenous peoples, will the new parks celebrate the oppressed or the oppressor? This is all becoming the theater of the absurd as here in the American west it&rsquo;s becoming criminal to even scavenge beer cans from roadsides least &#8220;Indian artifacts&#8221; be disturbed.  </p>

		<p>Just to provide a little counter point to the knee jerk reactions against all things non-white, there are a number of existing National Parks that have a real connection to Hispanic peoples in America.  The one I am most familiar with is Castillo De San Marcos National Monument in St. Augustine Florida.  I am from the southeast and have been fascinated with the south&rsquo;s colonial history of the struggle between the British, Spanish, French and Native Americans to control the area that now makes up the south eastern states.  The Spanish and their Indian allies began construction of what is now the oldest masonry fort in North America in 1672.  </p>
<p>Now of course the movers and shakers of early Spanish American were white by current definition (you can make your own judgement on the effect of Moor genes on the Spanish population) which goes to expose the strangeness and artificiality of Hispanic identity.  Much like some of those gorgeous blondes you see down in Mexico from time to time, especially on the Mexican soaps.</p>
<p>Anyway my point is that there is a real history of Hispanic peoples in the United States that goes back centuries not decades.  Now I personally am against surrendering white culture and history to the multi-cult socialist invaders that our political and business elites are flooding our country with and feel like whites need to stand up for their central role in the United States history and hopefully its future.  However, I don&rsquo;t think we should fall into the habits of the radical left and allow our politics and social beliefs to eclipse the truth. </p>

		<p>Well, Senior Salazar can learn from the Ãœber-successful Mexican-American Cultural Center in Los Angeles!! </p>
<p>Looks like the $7 million Supervisor Gloria &#8220;Bull&#8221; Molina spent on the center from her discretionary funds is working out well!</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/jg3l" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/jg3l</a></p>
<p> <i>The Mexican American cultural center lacks paying visitors and is in financial trouble.</i></p>
<p>October 05, 2011:</p>
<p><i>An ambitious downtown center created to celebrate the role of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles culture and history opened with great fanfare six months ago, fueled by more than $36 million in public funds and boasting a prominent board of directors.</i></p>
<p><i>Today the center, La Plaza de Cultura y Artes, is staggering. Its chief executive was let go in August, and he&rsquo;s accused of mismanagement. Attendance has been sparse. The private foundation set up to run it hasn&rsquo;t raised much money. Contractors complain they haven&rsquo;t been paid. And the staff has been slashed from 28 to 12.</i></p>
<p>So yeah, Senior Salazar, looks like we need to give more attention to hispanic &#8220;culture and history.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this is not what it&rsquo;s about Salazar, is it?  You said it yourself:  It&rsquo;s about <i>evening the score</i>.  Sounds like fighting words.  &ldquo;Por La Raza todo, fuera de La Raza nada!&rdquo;, right Salazar.</p>

		<p>I was forced to sit in on a meeting organized by a &#8216;latino advocacy&rsquo; group.  (Don&rsquo;t ask.)</p>
<p>They were so anti-white it was unreal.  They specifically mentioned white people as bad in one way or another at least 20 times in a one hour period.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s not blacks and latinos committing all the crimes!  It&rsquo;s white people!  They&rsquo;re the ones doing all the crimes!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end I took the organizers aside and pointed out that not all &#8216;white people&rsquo; were &#8216;bad&rsquo; and that they were doing the kind of racism and blanket condemnations they always spoke out against, and they finally agreed with me, to their credit.</p>
<p>Still, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how deep the anti-white, &#8220;We are destined to take this land&#8221; mentality is among all those Amerindians, (because that&rsquo;s what they are) have.</p>

		<p>I believe that most everyone who visits this site is a keen observer of where our nation is headed. Each and every day a little piece of the America that most of us grew up with is being ripped away and replaced with an illusion  &mdash;  a revised fantasy that never existed. Most of us here are probably somewhere between the ages of 40 to 75, so we have some kind of framework of an American past that, though imperfect, was a nation that other nations wanted to be like and a place where people would die trying to reach. In its current state, it is a mere shadow of its former self. We can all attest to that.</p>
<p>Our nation is now what Teddy Roosevelt called a &#8220;tangle of squabbling nationalities&#8221;, and not the European kind that he feared, but worse. A kind where there are no kindred ties of race like the Germans, English, Irish or Italians but groups completely alien to Americanism. And they are here to feed off of a dying carcass and strip clean the vestiges of our greatness. Our compassion has become our undoing. And we who remember have been rendered powerless by our own government. So alien races run roughshod over us physically and psychologically and the only courses we have are to sit in silence and wait for our end or rise up en masse and experience first hand how much the Republic our forefathers created has become a despot. The only answer I can see is either Tyranny or Civil War. The article above is just one more straw breaking the back of the camel. If anyone sees a better way, please let me know.</p>

<p>I have to agree with you. I do know one thing for certain. Voting will NEVER be the answer. We have seen what both sides have done to us. Both are enemies to our race and to the America that was suppose to be. They (politicians) are bought and paid for, bribed, threatened and God knows what else.</p>
<p>I do remember the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s and it was HEAVEN compared to the hell we are now witnessing. Even in my worst nightmare did I ever dream of an America that we now have and have had for the last 40 years or more. I remember the late 50&rsquo;s and the 60&rsquo;s ( I was still young then) is when I started seeing the unraveling of our race and our nation. I am sure it started way before then, but wasn&rsquo;t born yet. </p>

		<p>Where does Ken Salazar think we should start this process?</p>
<p>Is he proposing to rename Yellowstone National Park something like &#8220;Viva la Raza Park&#8221;?</p>
<p>The &#8220;Old Faithful&#8221; geyser could be &#8220;Senora des la Sombras&#8221; (aka Santa Muerte).</p>
