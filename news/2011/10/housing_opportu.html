	<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: President Obama has appointed radical integrationists to run HUD. They are requiring West Chester County in New York State to build subsidized housing and market it to non-whites. However, they cannot stop whites from applying, and since the new homeowners and renters will be chosen by lottery, they can&rsquo;t stop whites from winning, either.</em> You don&rsquo;t even have to live in New York State to apply<em>, so if you, or someone you know could use some government-subsidized housing, this could be an great opportunity.</em>]</p>

		<p>I left my neighborhood several years ago, joined the Army, and returned last year. When I left, it was peaceful, verdant, and really quite soothing. Now, thanks to HUD and subsidization vouchers, crime has gone up literally several-hundred percent points (there are real-time trackers, basically text equivalents of police scanners online). I cannot walk my dog at night. I cannot leave anything on my porch, ranging from a mop bucket to a grille, for fear of theft. Gunshots are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Because I was injured in Iraq I have been granted service-connected pay for disability, and that, coupled with my VA home loan, will allow me to escape my once-livable neighborhood and move somewhere else. But what about those who didn&rsquo;t have the misfortune to be injured in the war? Will they have to wait for it to happen here?</p>

According to the settlement of the lawsuit with NY HUD, Overwhelmingly white towns must build an X- number of affordable units if the number of blacks residents is less than 4% and Hispanics 7%.  </p>
<p>But despite the lawsuit agreement, this is anything but a done deal. So not so fast Obama and appointed minion, Shaun Donovan, US HUD Secretary. </p>
<p>Remember, These units aren&rsquo;t built yet and mark my words, Westchester County will/is stonewalling, obfuscating and delaying this thing until Obama and company are gone, along with the political will to push this thing through.</p>
<p>Affluent white northeast suburbs is where the $$$ and political power resides and they use it to fight back. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m betting this thing won&rsquo;t end up anything like what&rsquo;s outlined in the settlement agreement. So they can go ahead and send out all the info&rsquo; gathering forms they want. Because Hispanics and blacks can live in units that don&rsquo;t and probably won&rsquo;t exist.  </p>

		<p>I wrote about this here a while ago.  My blood boils every time I read about these programs.  There is nothing these towns can do.  The feds will destroy them.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s a pity we can&rsquo;t live in Garden City&#8221; the troublemakers complain in Nassau County, NY.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time folks.  It&rsquo;s not just the Democrats.  The vile neoCON, the now deceased Jack Kemp, was a supporter of these schemes too.  Does anyone know the voting patters in Westchester?  It&rsquo;s an upper middle class area.  I hope it&rsquo;s a Democrat town.  Let them enjoy the diversity they love, but only force on less well off whites.  I&rsquo;m so looking forward to the diversification of the Hamptons or the Georgetown area of D.C.  Or Judge Sand&rsquo;s neighborhood!  </p>

		<p>According to Wiki:<br>
More than 63% of Westchester County voters voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential race, the seventh-highest percentage of any New York county, behind four New York City boroughs and Albany and Tompkins counties. Currently, two of the three U.S. congressional representatives from Westchester County are Democrats.</p>

		<p>I used to be against forced integration; but I&rsquo;ve come to believe that far too many of my fellow Whites have been exposed to insufficient  &#8220;diversity&#8221; to make an informed opinion concerning the pros and cons of such arrangements.  I&rsquo;ve known far too many White liberals who spend their entire lives among Asians, other Whites, and atypical, higher-income Blacks and Latinos.  So, by all means, let the Obama administration spread the wealth around some. </p>

		<p>As much as I dislike subsidized housing, I think that it could be put to use for a good purpose.  For instance, the placing of subsidized housing could be a good way to direct the black population where they would do the least harm, as far away from the white population as possible.  If only our leaders could figure that out.  </p>
<p>Once while visiting Florida, I traveled through some small towns that appeared to be all black. This was some twenty years ago, I do not know what has happened to these towns since then, but I think it would be a good investment to build subsidized housing in these small black towns to keep them there and away from the white population.  For whatever reason they seem to have poured into the cities in recent decades which has been a disaster in every place they have gone.   </p>
<p>Some creative redistribution of population could make live much more bearable for us.</p>

		<p>Dave, I concur whole heartedly, I have been telling friends for years that the solution will only come when the blue bloods are force fed their own medicine. Up until then they will consider us hoi polloi  backwards and racist. A good strategy may be for like minded individuals to pool their resources and move a particularly well qualified &#8220;family&#8221; into the blue bloods neighborhood. When they have to endure the beer cans in their yards, the loud music, the cursing, the mean mugging and the crime THEN we will be allowed to solve the problem!</p>

		<p>I used to live in Malibu California. There is NO section 8 housing there. I believe we should build  high rise projects next to some of the rich liberal celebrities. Barbara Streisand would SCREAM if this happened to her. I would pay to see that. They would probably try to offer some lame excuse, like they are worried about the enviroment, etc. It would be hilarious to see rich liberals have a taste of their own medicine, and pathetically try to squirm their way out of it. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t recall any prominent Republican ever standing up against Section 8 Housing and forced integration. George W Bush, Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr were in office for a combined 20 years. They did NOTHING to stop this. Most of the section 8 housing was built in my former home town during Republican administrations, both presidential and gubernatorial. They did NOTHING to stop it. They encouraged it, if anything. Richard Nixon actually helped engineer all of this decay. Obama hates us and is trying to destroy our communities, but he had some help from Republicans&hellip;politicians who acted as if they were on our side. They&rsquo;re all the same.  If anyone can prove me wrong, I would welcome that. Please list any modern Republican you can think of who stood up against Section 8 housing. </p>

<p>So true! I am &#8220;elderly&#8221; now and I sure could use section 8 since 80% of my check goes on rent. But, as you say, I have seen far too many apartments that take section 8 and they are full of gangs, blacks, mexicans, hmongs, etc. The apartment complexes become ghettos/barrios in a very short time. I USED to live in many of those complexes back in my working days (before the section 8 nonwhites started moving in). No one needs to tell me about what it is like to live around those people. I had to keep moving to get away from it all. Now I live in a decent place and that is WHY I have to pay most of my income on rent. No section 8 is allowed here. I just wish section 8 was ONLY for the elderly and the disabled who TRULY need it. We are the ones living in true poverty.</p>

<p>You are right on the money, no Section 8 housing will ever be built there.  They&rsquo;ll take the lessons from the wealthy in California.</p>
<p>In California, developers in wealthy areas (where THEY reside) have a choice to either &#8220;include&#8221; Section 8 or low-cost housing in their housing plans or pony up  millions of dollars to a &#8220;low cost housing fund&#8221; to get out of any Section 8 mandates.  They figure the small (to them)  fine is well worth it to keep poor blacks and mexicans out of THEIR area and out of THEIR children&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>The wealthy also fund the campaigns of local city council members who have  power over local zoning ordinances such as slow or no-grown plans or open space set asides.  </p>
<p>If they see a development on the horizon, they&rsquo;ll contact politically powerful, zealous environmental groups (to which they donate large amounts) to agitate about &#8220;fragile environments&#8221; or &#8220;endangered species&#8221; (which may, in fact, be innocuous weeds, insects such as butterflies, snails or flies or 1/2&#8221; non-native fish   &mdash;    all of which have stopped developments dead in their tracks).  California has some of the most draconian environmental laws in the nation which can entangle a developer for decades as he&rsquo;s forced to spend millions of dollars to fight each one in turn.</p>
<p>For example, in wealthy Calabasas CA (from Wiki):</p>
<p><i>Safeguarding the environment and the protection of open space has been a longstanding priority for the residents of Calabasas. Calabasas played a vital role in the 10-year battle to save Ahmanson Ranch, a 2,983 acres  property in the Simi Hills in Ventura County nestled at the western edge of the San Fernando Valley, from development. The land was sold by Seattle-based Washington Mutual to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in late 2003 for $150 million. Ahmanson Ranch is now known as the Upper Las Virgenes Canyon Open Space Preserve and is protected from further development.</i></p>
<p>Extremely wealthy Santa Barbara, CA turned down a desalinization plant years ago, to keep the amount of city water severely limited.  This stops development and keeps housing prices high.  If one is a Santa Barbara elected official, try mentioning low cost housing or Section 8 around town and see if a recall petition against you hasn&rsquo;t been mustered up by the following morning and your opponent&rsquo;s war chest suddenly becomes flush with donations.</p>
<p>As you stated, they&rsquo;ll use their $$$ to fight back. (because it WORKS).</p>

		<p>It was Richard Nixon who came up with section 8.  Supposedly it was to break up the stranglehold the democrats had on the big cities of the big states that had all the electoral votes.</p>
<p>The blacks would disperse to the suburbs and no longer be under the control of the reverends, Daleys, Kochs, Dinkins etc.</p>

		<p> I am all white and on the waiting list for section 8 in my largely white rural area. Well, guess what anyone in the US can and does apply for section 8 anywhere it is open. This means I will have to wait another year because some blacks in the ghetto or mexicans in California are ahead of me. Also I know the ghetto blacks that have been moving in came here from other section 8 housing because they were accepting transfers, yes transfers and I live only one county away from a little Detroit of the North. I suggest everyone sign up and clog the waiting list. I am.</p>

You served our country in the military, and return home to a neighborhood that has been devastated by Section 8. The insult is compounded by the fact that it is your Commander in Chief  &mdash;  a man who you would have obeyed to the extent of walking into certain death  &mdash;  who ordered this devastation of your neighborhood.</p>
<p>My view: any presidential candidate who promises to eliminate Section 8 gets my vote. In my area it has destroyed both the schools and the property values. I not only have lost my chance of retiring at age 65 (my house is worth half what it was before the Section 8 apartment complexes began sprouting up), but  &mdash;  even worse  &mdash;  my kids are forced to attend schools with a sorry bunch of losers, who bully my son and make lewd comments to my daughters. </p>
<p>Why is my government doing this to me?</p>

<p>As for section 8. I feel that only seniors (who qualify by income) and the disabled should be the ONLY people that should get this help. NO WELFARE leeches OR immigrants, period.   That would cut the cost of section 8 tremendously and cut off many of these blacks/browns from ever getting it who destroy whole neighborhoods and have kid after kid to stay on the dole. Most seniors worked their whole lives and paid all the taxes and now many have to live in poverty among these leeches and thugs.</p>

		<p>If anyone told me twenty five years ago that the immediate south suburbs(Calumet City, Dolton, Riverdale, Burnham) of Chicago would resemble a war zone, I&rsquo;d think they were nuts. I&rsquo;ve seen many transitions compliments of section 8 Blacks, but the destrction of the south suburbs was probably the saddest of them all. Besides the crime, the saddest part was watching the mom and pop restaurants, ice cream parlors, bowling alleys, and comic book shop going out of business and being replaced with currency exchanges, payday loans, Shaniqua&rsquo;s nail shop, and Chinese carry outs. I grew up in a white working class community that bordered these burbs. I was always in awe of the ammenities they had. It was always my dream to live in such communities. Now, I wouldn&rsquo;t live there for free mainly because of the people that live there for free. </p>

		<p>I have a brother who lives in the Metro Atlanta area. The value of his home has dropped by at least 25% (if not more). In his neighborhood the people moving in are usually AA &#8220;government employees&#8221; who are chasing out the otherwise established residents. This is not section 8 per-Se; these are people bringing in otherwise nice salaries. Personally, I hope that if he becomes upside down that he would just mail the keys to the bank and make them deal with it. I have little sympathy for those banks that went along with these ridiculous schemes of the past few years. </p>
<p>Prior to this house, he lived in an area where some developer built a bunch of &#8220;condo&rsquo;s&#8221; across the street from the entrance to his subdivision. These were overpriced units that were only 900 sq ft. People in that area suspected that the developer was going to figure out a way to convert these to section 8 units. Then he would get in the good graces of whoever is in charge of dispersing inner city dregs to the hinterlands. I advised him to move out of Atlanta 10 years ago; whether he does that or not is his choice. He has pretty much decided that when and if they unload this house, he will just rent for a while. </p>
<p>He complained that where I live, it snows too much. My response was: Snow lasts for a couple of months; the dregs of society are a 24/7/365 headache. I have a marketable skill that I can take anywhere. The wife however likes being within a couple of hours of her family. I am concerned that if I ever buy some land in rural Wyoming that HUD might feel the need to build section 8 on the parcel of land next to me. There might be something humorous about gang bangers trying to flash mob elk &amp; buffalo. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m so grateful to live in a Chinese neighborhood- Section 8 will NEVER come to us because our neighborhood is already 80 percent &#8216;minority&rsquo;- majority is Chinese with a sprinkling of Korean, Japanese, Indian, and white families. Liberals stay far, far away from us. Crime rate is non-existent- we can leave our doors unlocked and walk down the street at 1AM. Schools consistently score in the 95th percentile and above on standardized tests.</p>
<p>If you whites are interested in safe neighborhoods with good schools without worrying about the wrath of section 8 and the thugs they bring into the neighborhood, consider moving to an Asian neighborhood if you live in city with a significant Asian population.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you know this but local housing authorities do not have the right to limit the housing to local people.  There have been court cases in which the judge decreed that the lists should be open to all people from everywhere.  Hopefully, another local housing authority could try<br>
 a new version of the attempted old rule, but instead of limiting subsidized housing to local people, I think that local people should at least get to go to the top of the list.  That only seems fair.  I wish someone who is on the side of right and fairness would do this and take it to court.  They could argue that local residents have paid taxes their all their lives and have family and friends in town.  This is a very humane sounding argument  &mdash;  preserving a sense of community.  You know, how the left is always pretending that they have humanitarian concerns when they are really taking a wrecking ball to society, well by not totally excluding outsiders but simply putting local people at the top of the list, it would keep out most of the outside trouble makers.  I wish we had more people with organization.  Judicial Watch might be a good organization to try, they have taken cases to court and won.  </p>

<p>Get enough of them and their thug children and a city can be destroyed.  But since Santa Barbara does not tolerate section 8<br>
I will definitely consider it.</p>
<p>I have been emailing realtors around California.  I found that they can respond to carefully worded inquiries about section 8.<br>
They cannot make any mention of race, but they can tell you whether or not there are or will be section 8 housing in any one city.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the day diversity came to my northern white liberal town in the 70&rsquo;s.  The middle school in the black part of town was demolished and the kids sent to the white part of town, where they terrorized the white students and teachers.  I call it the revenge of Robert E.

&#8220;A good strategy may be for like minded individuals to pool their resources and move a particularly well qualified &ldquo;family&rdquo; into the blue bloods neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great idea, a non profit Amren corporation helping poor ghetto-ites move to their white supporters neighborhood. A win win all the way around. Tax deductions for the contributions and sticking it the liberal hypocrites at the same time. Hell, the Feds may even throw in a HUD grant.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a sad fact that the black community, with few exceptions, needs to be subsidized to survive. Otherwise, it will quickly morf back into the shanty cultures of Haiti and Africa.</p>
<p>I would be in favor of housing for low-income blacks, providing some contingents were satisfied. </p>
<p>1. To qualify, those living in the housing development were required to be neutered. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m experiencing first the affects of Sec. 8 housing in my forerly White/Hispanic suburb of Chicago.  As they have been tearing down the &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; built for Blacks in the 60s/70s in Chicago, they are moving the inhabitants that destroyed those places, to the burbs where they will work their magic on nieghborhoods like mine.  Maybe someday in the future we will have a president who will compensate Whites for the ravages we&rsquo;ll have suffered from affirmative action, welfare, and this whole anti-White crusade we&rsquo;ve been engaged in, but I&rsquo;m afraid if it happens at all, it will take a dictator to fix this mess.</p>

		<p>I found myself in a mostly asian neighborhood some years ago.  As poster #30 states, it is relatively safe.  It was actually working class italian, irish and jewish up until about 15 years ago, when the explosion of immigration from asia really took root here.  Now I am the only white face for three blocks in any direction.  Really weird if you ask me.</p>
<p>There is some section 8 about ten blocks away, and sometimes those blacks maraud in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>But while it may be &#8216;safe&rsquo; on the surface, there is a wide network of chinese gangs that my chinese neighbors always mention.  They operate below the surface, being smarter about their crime than blacks and browns.</p>
<p>It may have the veneer of safety, but still I despair every day when I look around and feel as if I am in a foreign country.  And I am not even old yet!  What will the next fifty years do to my once great country?</p>

<p>I was in Santa Barbara two weeks ago. There were homeless vagrants EVERYWHERE downtown. Saw plenty of mestizos too!<br>
BTW&hellip;Santa Barbara has &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; as well as Section 8. Here is the link <a href="http://www.hacsb.org/cm/Home.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.hacsb.org/cm/Home.html.</a></p>
<p> I wonder if this affordable housing is attracting the homeless in such large numbers. <br>
Santa Barbara needs to clean up its city because it&rsquo;s turning into skid row El Norte.<br>

<p>That is true. HUD usually will never admit it but it is true. I read the LA Times one day a couple of years ago and the writer had investigated and found that the illegals were getting Section 8! The LA TIMES!!! They said they found 20 or more illegals living in these expensive homes under section 8. </p>

		<p>Suppose Section 8 was repealed tomorrow. Who here thinks the former recipients would move out peacefully? They&rsquo;d trash the place (or finish the job), or burn them down. And probably do the same to their neighbors&rsquo; houses out of spite.</p>

		<p><i>Saw plenty of mestizos too!</i></p>
<p>The mestizos ride in on buses from outlying areas, in no way can they afford SB&rsquo;s exorbitant housing prices:</p>
<p><i>This beautiful City exacts a high price from those who live here. Housing costs are among the highest in the nation, and vacancy rates are among the lowest. The gap between incomes and housing costs is great. 25,000-35,000 commute to and from Santa Barbara long distances from less expensive housing in outlying areas</i> </p>
<p>The housing stock in Santa Barbara is severely limited due to water restrictions and activist city dwellers. Section 8 is in existing housing only, only 1,000 units, 700 of which are contained in one area of the city.</p>
<p>Sept, 2011:</p>
<p><i>Santa Barbara has less than 1,000 affordable housing units, and a waiting list of between 4,000 and 5,000 families who can&rsquo;t afford market-rate homes. The list is so long that it was officially closed in July of 2009. Though the county is aware of its housing needs, no plan to address the problem is forthcoming.</i></p>
<p>Goleta, a bit north of Santa Barbara, fights affordable housing as well.  After contentious city council meetings pitting Section 8 advocates against city dwellers:</p>
<p>Sept 20, 2011:</p>
<p><i>The latest attempt to develop 240 acres of open space in the middle of Goleta met with total defeat on Tuesday night, as the Goleta City Council voted unanimously to deny studying whether Bishop Ranch should be rezoned from fallow farmland to a bustling suburbia.</i></p>
<p>Just trying to protect their community from gangs, graffiti, drugs, rotten schools and other problems brought in by mestizos and blacks.  They said they didn&rsquo;t want their city to turn into San Bernadino.  Can&rsquo;t say I blame them.</p>
