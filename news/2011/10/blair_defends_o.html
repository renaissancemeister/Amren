			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kristy Walker, Daily Mail (London), October 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tony Blair has defended Labour&rsquo;s controversial mass immigration policy by claiming that Britain cannot succeed unless it opens its borders to more people from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>The former prime minister said it was &#8216;right&rsquo; that the country was made up of different cultures and faiths mixing together.</p>
<p>Mr Blair added that migrants had made Britain &#8216;stronger&rsquo; and said those calling for greater curbs on foreigners entering the country were wrong.</p>
<p>His comments come just days after official figures revealed that the population is expected to soar by the equivalent of a city the size of Leeds every year for the next decade.</p>
<p>A defiant Mr Blair insisted his party&rsquo;s policy on immigration was the right one. He said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s been a very positive thing and there is no way for a country like Britain to succeed in the future unless it is open to people of different colours, faiths and cultures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under Labour, up to 5.5million people born outside the UK arrived as long-term migrants. </p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2010, around 2.3million left the country, meaning the UK population increased by around 3.2million as a direct result of foreign migrants.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eastern Eye newspaper, Mr Blair said: &#8216;The vision of a country of different cultures and different faiths mixing together is the right one.</p>
<p>&#8216;That is not to say you don&rsquo;t have problems at certain points, but those problems are to be overcome without losing the essence of what has actually allowed this country&rsquo;s people to get on and do well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His comments were branded &#8216;shameless&rsquo; by critics and are set to fuel claims that the huge increase in migrants under Labour were due to a politically motivated attempt by ministers to change the country.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Andrew Neather, a former adviser to Tony Blair, said that Labour&rsquo; s relaxation of controls was a deliberate plan to &#8216;open the UK to mass migration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added that Labour wanted to rub the &#8216;Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Blair added that the anti-immigration debate was one of the &#8216;past&rsquo;. &#8216;I think the majority of people in Britain today are not prejudiced and can understand the benefits of migration.</p>
<p>&#8216;I think what people worry about is where they feel there is no control over who comes in and there are no rules governing who comes in or not, and that is a different issue altogether.</p>
<p>&#8216;It would be very unfortunate if by putting those rules into place, we view that immigration was a somehow bad thing for the country, because it is not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tory MP Priti Patel, said: &#8216;As the daughter of immigrants, there is no question that those who work hard and make a positive contribution do enrich the fabric of our society.</p>
<p>&#8216;But what Tony Blair has failed to recognise is that while he was in power, he opened the floodgates of mass and uncontrolled immigration which has left a damaging legacy in our towns and cities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch, said: &#8216;This is completely shameless from the Prime Minister who brought more than three million immigrants into Britain in the teeth of public opposition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab added: &#8216;These comments are na√Øve if not reckless. Tony Blair has left Britain with a legacy of uncontrolled immigration that has put huge pressure on public services and undermined community cohesion&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>I thought Tony Blair had more sense that that, although I should have known that he and his buddy, George W., must have discussed how they could replace American and British citizens with the poor of third world countries. Some kind of death wish for their nations, I guess. I wish someone would explain to me how importing poverty and cultures diametrically opposite from their own is ever good for any country.</p>

<p>- Ha! Excellent sub-title.  I actually laughed when I read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&hellip;by claiming that Britain cannot succeed unless it opens its borders to more people from different backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Britain will only succeed in destroying itself and removing the British people from the world stage. Granted, I guess the far-left, anti-White, anti-Western Communists in power today would see that as a success.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tory MP Priti Patel, said: &lsquo;As the daughter of immigrants, there is no question that those who work hard and make a positive contribution do enrich the fabric of our society.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Only in the sense of enriching Ms. Patel&rsquo;s ethnic group.  Anything that is considered &#8220;positive&#8221; for a society can be gained through means other than immigration. When immigration is used to justify societal enrichment, the part such advocates leave out is the death and destruction of the original society.</p>
<p>- And lastly:  &#8220;That is not to say you don&rsquo;t have problems at certain points, but those problems are to be overcome without losing the essence of what has actually allowed this country&rsquo;s people to get on and do well.&#8221;</p>
<p>- The problem will be Civil Warfare as the indigenous Britains attempt to take back their Island. I guess you could call that one way to overcome the problem of immigration and retain the essence of your nation. It seems a better option though, would be to avoid immigration and not risk losing your country to being with.</p>

<p>That moron always reminded me of a wimp and a sell out. Please Mr. Blair explain just HOW have migrants made Britain stronger?  You can&rsquo;t because it is a total lie. Migrants are DESTROYING Britain just like they are every White nation they have invaded with help from you TRAITORS! I am sure there is a special hell for you when you leave this earth.</p>

<p>Now I understand why Britain failed to create an empire on which the sun never set, how she failed to invent the industrial revolution - it was because her population was all white and British! That&rsquo;s why she lost two world wars, because she lacked the &#8220;strength&#8221; of the ethnic chaos (sorry,&#8221;diversity&#8221;) she now enjoys.</p>
<p>Thank you for enlightening us, Mr. Blair. To think that right-wing commentators used to say that you had no sense of history! </p>

<p>Funny how history moves from the past to the present and leaves even people stuck in their notion of the present behind.  Blair is the enemy of whites, the enemy of Britain and all that is British and even European.  His example proves that Orwell was right; he used and is using words to deny force an artificial, unnatural surreality to be taken as normal, or right.   The imbecility of his remarks are only too obvious. </p>
<p>Older liberal celebrities are coming around.  Robert Plant, the famous front mag of the rock band, Led Zeppelin divorced his long time Pakistani wife and now makes Grammy winning records that are decidedly Western, and even sometimes a Gospel song.  Even Paul McCartney seems to be letting on that the old England was preferable, as Mick Jagger seems to be flying the flag as well.</p>

		<p>Blair is a globalist and globalists want to eliminate sovereignty and create a one world government which will eliminate all borders whether they are geographic, ethnic, cultural, or religious.  Once you understand this mindset - and they are the ones in control - everything will be crystal clear.  One world government = one world people (for us, not them).</p>
<p>Ron Paul is our only chance to stop them.  If he doesn&rsquo;t win, we&rsquo;re all doomed to either a long and bloody revolution or total enslavement.<br>

<p>Well, Bozo, why don&rsquo;t you give a speech listing every &#8220;benefit&#8221; you lyingly declare diversity gives to your country?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you why you won&rsquo;t.  Because there are no benefits, only dangers, chaos, mayhem and constant turmoil between the bickering tribes.  Diversity is so much a weakness only an imbecile would like it.</p>
<p>You and other moronic factions wanted to multiculturalize the country, because the population wasn&rsquo;t growing fast enough to produce the consumers and tax units you and your greedy geeks needed in order to increase your power and wealth.</p>
<p>And just as much to blame are the seditionists, because they wanted to see White capitalism destroyed, and of course there&rsquo;s the rainbow crowd who live in the Twilight Zone where the fairies dwell and they&rsquo;re just oozing with so much love and tolerance they can hardly contain themselves. </p>
<p>And how about the anti-nationalist crowd who think fractionalizing society will assure there will be no more nationalism by just one portion of the population, thereby making it safe for them and their idiot heirs?  I wonder how pleased they&rsquo;ll be when the third world hordes are climbing over the walls of their gated communities wanting what they have and determined to get it at all costs, while evening their ethnic scores with paybacks?</p>
<p>What do you think of your failing EU now that it is on the verge of collapse?  It didn&rsquo;t turn into the economic powerhouse that would rule the world, did it?  Instead of a conglomeration of multicultural hordes who flinch when you and the other power elites crack your slavish whips while you collected your ill-gotten gains, you have nations that are fraught with rioting, inner turmoil and no-go zones.</p>
<p>Bray on, fool.  Your streets are often filled with rioting and racial hate and every day brings the possibility of murderous bombings and attacks on the civilian population.</p>
<p>It will be armed civil upheaval soon on a grand scale and, afterwards, if you and your ilk are not brought to trial for your crimes against humanity it will be one of the greatest miracles of the 21st century.  </p>
<p>Just like you do with your inner circle of despicable friends, you&rsquo;ll make everybody&rsquo;s list at party time.  </p>

		<p>Blair is a blithering idiot. If Britains immigration nightmare has made that country stonger, he is using different definitions than everybody else. How much welfare money goes to the Muslims in his country? How much damage have Muslims done to the economy of England? Everybody is safe to walk about anyplace in England, especially the &#8216;no go&rsquo; zones where even police and firemen do not go. </p>
<p>And talk of stopping immigration is rooted in the past. What an idiot. That issue is on the frontal lobes of every God fearing Brit in the land. </p>
<p>Once the socialist politico&rsquo;s finish off England and Islam is running the show, maybe then the socialists will look around and say that multiculturalism and pandering to Islam was not such a good thing. But then it will be too late for England and for European civilization, for Islam is very good about wiping away a nations cultural history. </p>
<p>Good luck England and start looking around for some leaders like Geert Wilders who want to preserve Europe.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s still illegal for the monarch to be a Catholic,  marry a Catholic or baptize their children Catholic.  If heirs to the throne marry Catholics they must renounce their claims to the throne before the marriage.  This applies right down to #200, such as 3rd cousins who realistically have no hope of inheriting.</p>
<p>If Britian is so diverse, tolerant and multicultural perhaps they should stop discriminating against Catholics in this way.  Surely it is against freedom of religion to disinherit a person should he or she decide to attend one Christian church rather than another?</p>
<p>And forbidding someone to marry someone of another brand of Christianity.  Surely that is against the universal declaration of human rights and thousands toleration statements over the years.</p>

		<p>I enjoy studying history.  One of the downsides is I have a better idea of what is being lost in the world as the Western European nationstates are overrun by immigrants who don&rsquo;t assimlate and overwhelm and destroy the host culture.  It brings tears to my eyes to think that this is the way the mighty British are set to disappear.  I can&rsquo;t write what I want to say to Blair and the others who did this to such a great and formerly enduring people.  They survived as a people for millenia and THIS is the way they go out!  I have no words.</p>

He never had the slightest intention of monitoring his experiment at mid-way points. He has been a revolutionary from the start. Don&rsquo;t expect him to change his opinion now. How can he?</p>

		<p>the empire was not founded on immigrants being in Britain.  the great indian mutiny of the Bengal Army was based on the Indians feeling that a different caste of Sahib had taken over from the founders of the empire.  the sahibs were pencil pushers and politicans instead of soldiers of fortune.  Blair is a politician who lacks common sense and respect for his countries future and respect for the white race.  the resulting stupidity will again create a bloody and violent result.</p>

What Blair says is demonstrably fase across the board - in fact, glaringly so! Yet still, those of his ilk continue to promote a clearly disasterous and destructive ideology for their own people, their own countries.

		<p>Most people in Europe realize that uncontrolled Third World and Muslim immigration has been an absolute catastrophe.</p>
<p>Low fertility rates in Europe led to dropping populations, the elites wanted to make up the difference with anybody who happened to be available.</p>
<p>Since millions of people are desperate to get into Europe in order to escape the failed societies that produced them, it was a perfect match.</p>
<p>Based on the PSYCHOTIC CULT of race denial, it never occurred to anyone that Somalians and Pakistanis might not fit perfectly into European society.</p>
<p>A good illustration of the principle that:</p>
<p>denying race difference is relatively harmless when it functions as a HYPOCRITICAL LIE and when disadvantaged minorities are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>But as soon as it morphs from a HYPOCRITICAL LINE to a PSYCHOTIC DELUSION, it must inevitably destroy the affected society.</p>
<p>The behavior of blacks and Pakistanis, of Muslims in general, and other minorities in England has been so unspeakably, hideously, cataclysmic we awful that ordinary English people are now race realists to a man (But are afraid to say so publicly for fear of legal sanctions).</p>

<p>The last monarch who asserted himself on any issue was James the second around 1688.  The aristocrats who ruled England ran him out and put a Dutch prince married to one of James 11 daughters on the throne.</p>
<p>20 years later they scrounged around Europe and put not heir number 1 or 2 or even 10 on the throne.  They put heir number 54 on the throne, George Guelph of Hanover. Much of his attraction was that he never learned English so was a totally ineffective ruler.</p>
<p>Henry V111 was the last assertive King of England who ruled and did what he wanted.  His son Edward was a puppet of the Seymours and the puritians.  Mary Tudor was put in place and run by the Howard Dukes of Norfolk.  Despite all the glorious regina nonsense, Elizabeth Tudor was a puppet of the Cecil family, first William and then his son.  They went from middle class attorneys to the Lords Burgehely as reward for putting her on the throne and running the kingdom for her.</p>
<p>The monarchs are nothing but actors whose lines are written by the real rulers and whose every move is choreographed and directed.  Learn your lines, be on time, hit your marks, do what the public relations people tell you.</p>

		<p>Two brief quotes may interest Americans still bothering to study the history of Britain, or what remains of it.<br>
(1) &#8220;Had [Churchill] continued in office beyond April 1955, legislation [to curb &#8220;New Commonwealth&#8221; immigration] would have been introduced far earlier than it was.&#8221; - Ian Gilmour, &#8220;Whatever Happened to the Tories&#8221; (1997) pp.79-80.<br>
(2) &#8220;Great Britain is far weaker than in the bright dawn of 1997, while Blair himself is pitifully diminished&hellip;. For all his parade of religious zeal, he seems incapable of contrition. A man who has apologised for everything from slavery to the Irish famine says that he &#8216;will never apologise&rsquo; for what he has done in Iraq, and to his own country.&#8221; - Geoffrey Wheatcroft, &#8220;Yo Blair!&#8221; (2007) pp.153-154.</p>

		<p>Blair is an unmitigated idiot of the very worst kind - a high IQ one. Unlike he thinks, besides a pretty abstract level there&rsquo;s not much point in talking about immigration as such. Immigration is always some group of people arriving into nation, and since the people of this Earth are so very diverse, one must always look like what the immigrants are like and how they&rsquo;re going to fit in. Now, of course some immigrants have been a blessing for Britain. Indians for one have thrived mightily. Some others are a mixture of good and bad, and quite a few are massive net negatives. Blind refusal to admit this diversity and employ ruthless selectiveness while admitting people in has led to the current situation where the harm done by immigration hugely outweighs the good. People like Chinese, Jews or Germans you can let in pretty freely without too much concern, but when talking about Africans or Arabs, you need to be very careful about selecting only the best. Even then you don&rsquo;t want to take in too many, at least not as long as US gangsta culture and Islamism remain such powerful cultural influences.</p>

		<p>Constantinople fell to the turks because of their cannons, the biggest and most effective in the world.  Those cannons were developed, cast and managed throughout the conquest of the renmants of Greece by a Christian Hungarian traitor, a 15th century Tony Blair.</p>
<p>The Greeks knew the city would fall within a day.  They held a midnight mass and prayer vigil in Santa Sophia.  Here is a Greek folk song commenmorating the service.</p>
<p>The Turks gave the Christians limited freedom of religion.  The Muslim ruled English goverment will not do even that.  Christianity will be abolished as just another evil manifestation of White privilege and responsible for all the wrongs of the earth.</p>
<p><br>
 The Last Mass in Hagia Sofia, the haunting Greek folk song about the ceremony that was actually held at midnight, May 28, 1453, two hours before the final Turkish assault began: </p>
<p><br>
 God rings the bells, earth rings the bells, the sky itself is ringing, </p>
<p>The Holy Wisdom, the Great Church, is ringing out the message,</p>
<p>Four hundred sounding boards sound out, and two and sixty bells.</p>
<p>For every bell there is a priest, and for every priest a deacon.</p>
<p>To the left the emperor is singing, to the right the patriarch, </p>
<p>And all the columns tremble with the thunder of the chant.</p>
<p>And as the emperor began the hymn to the Cherubim,</p>
<p>A voice came down to them from the sky, from the archangel&rsquo;s mouth:</p>
<p>Cease the Cherubic hymn and let the sacred objects bow;</p>
<p>Priests take the holy things away, extinguish all the candles;</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s will has made our city now a Turkish city.</p>
<p>But send a message to the West, and let them send three ships:</p>
<p>The first to take the Cross, the second to remove the Gospel,</p>
<p>The third, the finest, shall rescue for us our holy altar&hellip;</p>
<p>The Holy Virgin was distressed, the very icons wept.</p>
<p>Be calm, beloved Lady, be calm and do not weep for them;</p>
<p>Though years, though centuries shall pass, they shall be yours again.</p>

This will see Brazil, which last year overtook Italy to become the world&rsquo;s seventh biggest economy, move up one more place to sixth with the UK falling to seventh. Robert Wood, the EIU&rsquo;s chief economist on Brazil, said the country&rsquo;s surge up the table owed much to a growing consumer class and a booming trade relationship with China, based on the Asian giant&rsquo;s need for commodities such&hellip;</p>

<p>Both countries are quite diverse but Brazil and other south American countries are ruled by racially conscious whites and they have no intention to give their power up. They are mostly very rich, too.</p>
<p>On a racial basis, Southern Brazil (e.g. Rio Grande do Sul) is the whitest part of the country (with huge numbers of Italians and Germans) and not surprisingly the powerhouse, being much more close to Uruguay and Argentina than the &#8220;diverse&#8221; regions of Brazil. </p>
<p>Perhaps the British and Americans should learn how to rule a diverse country from their southern European kinsmen who have extensively dealt with non-whites during their history before they lead their countries to a complete collapse&hellip;</p>

<p>The last traitor was hanged in 1946 (Lord Haw-Haw) for treason, for siding with the Nazis.  Blair must have been thinking ahead because he repealed the death penalty in 1998.   He also incorporated The Human Rights Convention into British law and relaxed immigration policies which opened the door to mass Muslim immigration.</p>
<p>Blair&rsquo;s regime ADVERTISED for foreign immigrants in one of the most hostile, anti-White countries in the world:  Pakistan.</p>
<p><i>The British Embassy in Pakistan distributed glossy pamphlets entitled &#8216;Multicultural Britain  &mdash;  a Land of Immigrants&rsquo; which gave a raft of arguments as to the benefits of living in Britain such as well paid jobs, plain old welfare, and the prospect of inviting over the entire extended family (sans goat) once a British passport had been acquired.</i></p>
<p>Results?</p>
<p>* <i>MI5 believe there are up to four thousand potential terrorists and thirteen thousand Al Qaeda sympathizers living in Britain. The CIA devotes an astonishing forty percent of their anti-terrorist homeland security operations against suspects not in Afghanistan or Waziristan, but in Britain itself  &mdash;  a country described by one CIA operative as &#8216;a swamp of Jihadis.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>* <i>Barack Obama&rsquo;s counter-terrorist advisor Bruce Riedel recently stated: &#8216;The British Pakistani community is recognised as probably Al Qaeda&rsquo;s best mechanism for launching an attack against North America.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>England sacrificed over 900,000+ in WW I and another 388,000+ in WW II for THIS?</p>
<p>Alex Henshaw, a test pilot during WW II who survived the war, said the following before he died in 2007:</p>
<p><i>I feel extreme emotional sadness for the young men I knew that gave their lives willingly for a cause in which we all believed. And I often say to myself now if those young boys would come down now and walk through the villages, through the towns and through the cities and look around and see what is happening to us, they would say somewhere along the line we have been betrayed.</i></p>
<p>Unbelievably, earth-shatteringly, beyond-words betrayed.  The word betrayed hardly conveys the absolute irreversable evil Blair set in motion upon Native Born Britons.</p>

He starts importing the poverty into the UK</p>
