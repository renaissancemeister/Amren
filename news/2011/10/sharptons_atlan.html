<h1>Sharpton&rsquo;s Atlanta HQ Admits Handing Out Possibly Bogus Stimulus Check Forms</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Paul Crawley, 11 Alive (Atlanta), September 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>So far, no one has proven it&rsquo;s a scam, but they haven&rsquo;t proven it&rsquo;s for real either.</p>
<p>This week more than 700 senior citizens filled out a rather skimpy form promising a $500 check from the American Opportunities Stimulus Program.</p>
<p>They filled in sensitive information like their name, address, birth date and social security numbers, all with the promise of getting a Visa Check card in return.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, Fulton County government put out a warning that it might be an identity theft scam.</p>
<p>They even sent their own camera crew to the Atlanta headquarters of Rev. Al Sharpton&rsquo;s National Action Network, where the forms were being handed out by Vanessa Emerson and her son, Brandon.</p>
<p>In the video Vanessa Emerson can be seen brandishing a photo copy of a U.S. Treasury check saying, &#8220;I&rsquo;m going to show ya&rsquo;ll, I got my money.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the alarm went out, Brandon Emerson returned hundreds of the forms to the NAN headquarters at 632 Peoples Street so they could be given back to the seniors who filled them out.</p>
<p>Even though his mother was wearing a NAN T-shirt in the Fulton County government video, her son claimed they are not affiliated with the organization.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reached by phone on Friday, Vanessa Emerson said she and her son had no idea the forms they&rsquo;d been collecting might be fake.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Why should this surprise anyone? Sharpton should be in prison. His NAN is a race-baiting shakedown organization promoting the sleazeball in charge and his low IQ criminal buddies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take advantage of anyone for a quick buck.</p>
<p>This is what Africa is like on a larger scale.</p>

		<p>Jesse Jackson taught Al everything about &#8220;shake down&#8221; race baiting and politican pushovers.</p>
<p>America should be ashamed of empowering such scoundrels.  Thats before we mention the disgrace of a regime running our America.</p>
<p>The very fact these people are given the power to act is proof we as citizens no longer care&hellip;.we are lost sheeple.</p>

		<p>Blacks in the U.S. have been scamming other blacks for centuries.  It shows how gullible they believe one another to be.  Now, with a black in the White House, con men and women can fool people with promises of &#8220;Obama money&#8221;, reparations, or any other freebie that might conceivably come from the power of the Prez.</p>

		<p>What can one say when &#8220;conservatives&#8221; such as Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity, Bill O&rsquo;Reilly, Michael Steele, and, yes, George W. Bush, grovel before Sharpton for his approval?  It says something about leadership today on the Right. </p>

		<p>I could care less if blacks scam other blacks. They have been doing it to US for eons. If blacks think they are getting Whitey&rsquo;s tax dollars for free they will jump at it and then continue to stab us in the back. Have you ever heard a black say thank you for all the freebies we foolishly have given them for decades now?  They are too busy laughing at us.</p>

<p>My favorite black-on-black scam is the one where black &#8220;tax preparers&#8221; (actually con artists) have their black clients claim a &#8220;slavery reparations tax credit&#8221; on their 1040s. The clients get prosecuted for fraudulent filing, tax evasion, etc., while the scammers skip town. Looters getting looted   &mdash;   the ultimate in poetic justice!</p>
<p>Of course, this only works on the relatively small number of blacks who actually pay any income tax in the 1st place.</p>

<p>The ghetto variation of this is to sell pieces of macadamia nut while calling them rocks of cocaine, then using the money to buy a box supposedly containing a flat-screen TV that contains a piece of plywood.</p>
