<h1>Emergency Room Could be Hazardous to Your Black Health</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Recent studies on racial disparities in trauma centers give African Americans much pause before they rush off to the hospital.</p>
<p>One study found that African Americans are more likely than Whites to die from a gunshot or other assault-related injury after arriving at a trauma center.</p>
<p>In a recent report published in the Journal of Trauma, Injury, Infection and Critical Care, data from 137,618 black and white assault victims over the age of 15 treated at 100 trauma centers between 2005 and 2008 found that the overall death rate for Blacks was higher than Whites, 8.9 percent compared to 5.1 percent.</p>
<p>One of the authors of the study, Anthony R. Harris, emeritus professor of sociology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said while the findings were consistent with previous studies, he could not pinpoint the reason for the racial disparity.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has to do with the fact that Blacks, who account for 76 percent of all trauma center deaths, are also uninsured. But no one may be ready to charge racism just yet or that lack of insurance may have played into what may have been inferior treatment.</p>

		<p>This one is too easy. Blacks that suffer violent trauma are more likely to die because of the delay in reaching the hospital. When shots ring out or knives flash in the ghetto the neighbors are unlikely to call 911. This means the critically injured are left lying out or have to stagger their own way to the emergency room. Another method is the ghetto ambulance-the casualties&rsquo; homies drive him up to the ER doors and drop him off. No one wants to stick around to talk to police.</p>

<p>Which, of course, could be cured by raising taxes on white people to buy black people health insurance. How could white people be so heartless?</p>
<p>Or, just maybe, just perhaps, the higher death rate among blacks has something to do with the white tendency to settle barroom conflicts with fists, in contrast with the black tendency to settle barroom conflicts with knives and Glocks. </p>

		<p>Maybe it is due to the fact that many blacks come to the ER after being shot.  Of course it has nothing to do with the extreme violence blacks engage in but is due to racism from whitey&hellip;. the whine never stops.</p>

<p>Insurance or the lack thereof has nothing to do with it. To even suggest so is preposterous. These folks when they arrive at the trauma center are in really bad shape. Shot or stabbed multiple times, beaten with chunks of concrete, drug overdose, etc. In a very bad way when they arrive and quite often have other factors that mitigate against the life being saved! Please - - don&rsquo;t even suggest that lack of insurance has something to do with it.</p>

<p>Blacks are more likely to die from gunshot wounds or other assault related injuries, because they&rsquo;re more prone to getting shot/assaulted in the first place.</p>

		<p>The author of the study states that blacks are uninsured.  He can&rsquo;t be taken seriously.  Hasn&rsquo;t he ever heard of Medicaid?  Anyway, the hospitals will treat everyone.  </p>

		<p>I am going to guess that most whites shot are by accident thus the wounds are typically in lethal areas, are single shot and the victim is rapidly moved to a hospital for care.  Ghetto shootings are often with intent to kill, with multiple shots to the heart or head, and a wait until someone calls 911 for help to arrive.  </p>

		<p>Years ago there was an article in the Wall Street Journal about the Newark hospital that was designated the place to airlift the President should he be shot in the NYC area.  Turns out that hospital had the most experience in the NY metropolitan area with gunshot wounds.</p>

		<p>This is the real reason that no form of &#8216;socialized medicine&rsquo; will ever gain traction in the USA.<br>
 The USA is an outlier, every other advanced nation in the World has some form of socialized medicine.<br>
 But White Americans know full well, that under any socialized system they will be paying top whack to subsidize the depravity of American blacks.</p>

		<p>An article such as this will no doubt spawn (or add fuel to) an urban legend that blacks are being ignored in ER&rsquo;s.  Journalists who print such outright lies are guilty of the worst kind of professional lapse of ethics.  It&rsquo;s common knowledge in this nation that ER&rsquo;s must treat everyone, and, as someone who worked in health care for over 30 years, I can attest to the fact that no one checks insurance coverage before stopping the bleeding.  Obviously, however, editors believe that any lie is fine and dandy if it accuses whitey and his power structure of giving blacks an ounce less of anything.  However, the terms &#8220;lack of insurance&#8221;, &#8220;lack of access to health care&#8221;, &#8220;poverty&#8221;, and such have become throw-away excuses that few journalists apparently even think about when tossing into an article.  They mean about as much as the mythical &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>There are probably a number of reasons for this.  The person who posted above and stated that more of the white injuries are accidental, while more of the black injuries are attempted murder has probably captured the most important reason.  Somebody else mentioned that there may be delays in getting blacks to the hospital for various reasons.  This is also probably true.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll add a couple of my own theories:  (1) Blacks who are shot are often living in ghetto areas with black-run hospitals, with predominantly black staffs.  This will lead to worse outcomes.  (2)  When a gun goes off by accident in the suburbs, the victim is taken to a trauma center where he is the sole person in the ER with a gunshot wound, and is given top priority over nearly all other patients.  In contrast, when a half-dozen people are shot in a black altercation in the ghetto, several of them may end up at the same hospital, competing for the attentions of the ER staff.  There is going to be some &#8220;triage error&#8221; and in cases where the hospital is simply overwhelmed, time is going to run out for some victims.  (3) Black victims are probably a lot more likely to be &#8220;legally intoxicated&#8221; with alcohol, or high on drugs at the time that they are shot.  This is going to be associated with worse outcomes.</p>

		<p>As other posters have stated, the REAL reasons.</p>
<p>1. Reluctance to call 9-11 and the delay of medical help THIS causes.<br>
2. Homies finally driving the &#8220;victim&#8221; to the hospital, drop and go.<br>
3. The savageness of the attack (multiple gun shots or stabbings)</p>
<p>They are their OWN worst enemies.</p>

		<p>I suspect that the real answer to this ostensible anomaly is that the great majority of white shooting victims result from accidental discharges, in which one unaimed round is fired.</p>
<p>The majority of black shooting victims are victims of violent crime and thus more often shot repeatedly and with deadly intent.</p>

<p>Remember that article about feral dogs in the black neighborhood of St. Louis.  One poster wrote that a young man had been killed by dogs in that neighborhood.  He screamed for hours during and after the attack and no one called 911.</p>
<p>The major factor though, is the gun and knife injuries.  The more patients come on the point of death from gun injuries, the more patiesnts will die. <br>

<p>Not in an ER.  The providers are emloyees of the hospital. It does not matter what they do or don&rsquo;t do. They get their paychecks.</p>
<p>The hospital goes after the insurance companies, medicaid and medicare for the payment.  Goverment funds, more  taxpayers money provide medical care for victims of crime which gun and knive wound victims are.</p>
<p>The state victims of crime funds pay for all these black criminals who are victims of other black criminals.<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I was that poster, but I remember the case vividly, because the park where it happened was very close to my middle school, though it happened long after I graduated and long after that middle school moved to a different building.  I think the reason why nobody called 911 for hours is because nobody heard him screaming.  The park is hardly patronized, and it is tree filled along the edges with a big open space in the middle   &mdash;   Even from the top floors of my middle school looking west, you couldn&rsquo;t see into the open space center of the park.  And, as I said, that school was closed and empty at the time.</p>
<p>As for ERs and gunshot wounds, there is a Federal law that requires ER personnel to call the cops whenever they get a gunshot wound.  I don&rsquo;t know if this is common knowledge in the ghettos, if it is, some blacks who get shot might not want to be taken to the ER because they have outstanding warrants.</p>

		<p>Another factor might be that whites are statistically more likely than blacks to attempt suicide with a handgun.  This study shows that of blacks and whites who arrive at the ER still ALIVE, the blacks fare worse.  But many of the white males who shoot themselves will be declared dead on arrival.  If they had been alive when they arrived, the ER probably would not have been able to save them.</p>
<p>Considering that this study does not attempt to &#8220;match&#8221; cases, I don&rsquo;t know that it is worth much.  As others have pointed out, to have been deliberately shot multiple times is going to lead to a far worse outcome, on average, than being accidentally shot once.</p>

It is too true about knife and gun wounds. In my street on the edge of the hood, right near a major medical center with an ER within a three minute walk, two gangstas got into a dispute over a broken radio. Banger 1 broke the radio and gave it to banger #2 who managed to fix it. Banger #1 then wanted the radio back so when he saw banger #2 walking home from the Ghetto-Mart (everyone in my city calls it this) he ran out onto the sidewalk and stabbed #2 to death. This was in the late afternoon, prior to 5:00PM. When I arrived home from work I noticed cops everywhere and asked one of the officers what happened. This guy likely arrived at the ER mortally wounded. Imagine being murdered in broad daylight on your way home from the market over a radio! It gives new meaning to the word &#8216;stupid&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Another time I came home after dark to find the entire street awash in the flashing lights of emergency vehicles. As I reached the front door of our building I find one of the recently arrived Filipina nurses standing on the steps gazing at the building across the street. I asked her what happened and she just blurts out &#8220;it is always that building&#8221;. I educated her with &#8220;it&rsquo;s not the building, it&rsquo;s the people that live in that building!&#8221;</p>

  I can assure you this has nothing to do with anything. Don&rsquo;t let them fool you. ER docs/nurses have no idea who is insured in a life or death situation (that is figured out later) and they could care less. Almost anyone you see in an ER is payed on a salary. Even if you play the game of saying they don&rsquo;t care, they do have pride and any life saved is a prideful moment and a life loss is a sad, humble moment. Anyone applying finances as who lives or dies in an ER has NEVER EVER worked in an ER. There simply babbling. </p>
