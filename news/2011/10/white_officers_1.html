<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15341661">White Officers Accuse Metropolitan Police of Racism</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC, October 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six white police officers have accused Scotland Yard of racial discrimination, saying they are the victims of political correctness.</p>
<p>The officers are taking the Metropolitan Police to an employment tribunal  &mdash;  but accuse the force of delaying tactics.</p>
<p>One of the officers, speaking for the first time to the BBC, said he now had nothing but contempt for the force.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard says it rejects the claims and will contest them in court.</p>
<p>The six men, all members of the Territorial Support Group, were tried and acquitted in a trial relating to alleged race-related assaults.</p>
<p>One of the officers was accused of assaulting teenagers of Arab background in west London. A colleague was accused of threatening behaviour. The four other officers allegedly covered up the incident.</p>
<p>The matter came to court because a seventh member of the unit, a black officer, gave evidence against his former colleagues  &mdash;  but all six were cleared at the trial at Kingston Crown Court in the autumn of 2009.</p>
<p>Bill Wilson, the sergeant who led the team, has retired after a career of 30 years, but says that after the trial he and others were sidelined.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Panic at the top&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Mr Wilson accused Scotland Yard of charging them because it feared it would be accused of institutional racism if it did not act on the black officer&rsquo;s complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am convinced that there was a panic,&#8221; Mr Wilson told the BBC. &#8220;It was a black officer making an allegation against six white officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it had been a white officer making that allegation, then the matter would have been dealt with in-house there and then. That would have been the end of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is any allegation by any black or ethnic minority person against white police officers, they have gone in completely the opposite direction to the point where it is actually the white officers getting discriminated against.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they are terrified of this label of institutional racism and they are terrified of being accused of not taking a black officer&rsquo;s allegations seriously because that could be twisted round to say they are ignoring him because he is an ethnic minority officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s political correctness gone mad.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Institutional racism</strong></p>
<p>In their tribunal case, the men are arguing that the force treated them unfairly because of the Met&rsquo;s decision-making culture since the 1999 Macpherson Inquiry into the killing of Stephen Lawrence.</p>
<p>The report labelled the Metropolitan Police institutionally racist and led to massive reforms.</p>
<p>Lynne Burns, the men&rsquo;s lawyer, said they would argue in their employment tribunal that they had been victimised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this case is a complete embarrassment to [the Met] and really they just want to bury it and for it never to come to court,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard what the new commissioner has said about honesty, integrity and transparency  &mdash;  all the things that this case is distinctly lacking. I would really like to meet with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that it denied the allegations and would defend its actions in court.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is committed to ensuring that any allegations of wrongdoing by officers or staff are investigated fairly and proportionately no matter who makes the allegation or against whom it is made,&#8221; said the spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MPS expects the highest standards of its staff, who are all fully aware that they will be held accountable for their conduct and behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;The employment tribunal claim is stayed pending the conclusion of the independent IPCC investigation; this is outside the control of the MPS.&#8221;</p>
<p>Superintendent Leroy Logan is the deputy chair of the Black Police Association and has lobbied police chiefs to take seriously racism and whistleblowing.</p>
<p>He said the force has moved on since Macpherson and that white officers would be treated no differently to black officers.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;Everyone would be treated the same. They would be given the support and if there were merits in the case, it would be put to the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colour is immaterial. If you are a whistleblower, then you need support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see political correctness but efficiency and effectiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill Wilson and the other five officers in the case face a separate legal action by the youths who made the original allegation of assault. One of the six officers, Pc Mark Jones, was also tried and acquitted earlier this year of assaulting a man during a counter-terrorism raid in 2003.</p>
<p>Mr Wilson said: &#8220;I feel nothing more than contempt [for the Met]. I feel very angry, very upset about the way I&rsquo;ve been dealt with. I retired after thirty years and wasn&rsquo;t spoken to by anybody in any senior position. It makes you feel pretty worthless. I don&rsquo;t know why I did the thirty years. I could not recommend it as a career to anybody.&#8221;</p>

		<p>For me, the answer is simple.  </p>
<p>If the London Metropolitan Police Department were not concerned or bothered by accusations of &#8220;racism,&#8221; &#8220;institutional&#8221; or otherwise, none of these problems would exist.  Racism Schmacism, they should say.  The man wrote a whole book about it, in fact&hellip;</p>

<p>Why were they supporting the same people that are dispossessing them, and their own kind?</p>

		<p>For years after the Rodney King arrest the White Los Angeles just looked the other way.  Let the blacks and hispanics kill, rape and rob each other.  The slightest mistake by a White officer leads to endless accusations, hearings and no hope of ever being promoted.</p>
<p>Because of affirmative action White officers can&rsquo;t get promoted anyway, so why bother.  The politicians don&rsquo;t want the law enforced against minorities anyway.</p>

		<p>I visited England after a long time. And when I told my Indian mother about the sites and sounds, she was horrified and said that the white man has gone nuts by allowing our people to immigrate en masse.</p>
<p>Western nations can absorb small numbers of non-western peoples. But allowing us non-whites to immigrate into societies where we have nothing in common and then altering those societies to accommodate us is suicide! and for someone like me, it is even more painful because I left India precisely to get away from this sort of racial and tribal pandering. </p>
<p>One can only hope that ordinary white persons wake up to renewed vigor and pull down this evil house of cultural marxism and third world tribalism.   </p>

		<p>Poster #3. I tend to agree with your assessment. LA is a lousy city for crime for many reasons, not least of which is that the civilian to officer ratio is greater than 470:1.  Compare this to say NYC roughly 210:1, or Chicago where its around 216:1, or even St Louis (which is still overrun with crime) at 259:1. In essence, Los Angeles has been abandoned by the police department, or at least large sections of it have. </p>

		<p><i> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s political correctness gone mad.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>This is a very common phrase in the UK.  The idea generally seems to be that tolerance and diversity are OK but sometimes the ideology goes a little too far.  </p>
<p>What these police officers do not understand is that there is no such thing as &ldquo;political correctness gone mad.&rdquo;  The whole point of PC is to destroy indigenous white civilization and replace it with a multicultural multisexual &#8220;Utopia&#8221;.  There is nothing &#8220;mad&#8221; about this - it is a carefully crafted plan.  </p>
<p>The question must always be: &#8220;who benefits?&#8221;  When white people are murdered, raped, robbed, etc, this must always be the question.  Those at the top of the hierarchy benefit whether politically, financially, or just from feeling &#8220;good&#8221;.  </p>
<p>The &#8220;collateral damage&#8221; caused by &ldquo;political correctness gone mad&rdquo; is of no relevance providing a select tranche of society get what they want (and they do).</p>

		<p>Anon. #3: White Officers and those Citizens should just let it happen in the ghettoes. Why would anyone want to rush in and stop a gunfight in &#8220;their&#8221; neighborhoods? </p>
<p>As long as they stay out of predominately White Neighborhoods, and leave White people alone, then it really isn&rsquo;t our concern.</p>
<p>Police Officers, in general, cannot enforce the law without being called in on &#8220;Racism&#8221; and &#8220;Discrimination&#8221; bull crap.</p>
<p>The blacks and browns want it both ways. They want protection, normally from their own kind, but when one of their own kind is arrested, or shot and killed by Police in a shoot-out, then we get the demonstrations in the streets, and the constant whining about how great a guy the Cops shot. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wash our hands of them, already. </p>

		<p>Police patrol work, or crime investigation work, that involves the Black community anywhere in the U.S. or U.K. is what might be termed in the school of hard knocks as &#8220;Reality 101&#8221;.  The counterfeited Blacks and the counterfeited Black &#8220;experience&#8221; fed to Americans on MSM and in most cinema and overtly on university campuses serves for most whites to filter out of awareness the few actual contacts they have.  In Soviet Russia folks realized they were being lied to and that a great &#8220;make believe&#8221; was being indulged within  a kind of  national circus of verbalizing primates.  It is much more terrifying in America  to find people actually absorbed into a delu-sphere in which they are unwittingly the agents of their own subjection.   </p>

<p>This is why Indians are different from ALL other non-whites.  The 200 year rule of the British Empire had the effect of further civilizing an already old civilization.  They (mostly) value the White West and understand its importance.  Thank you for your post, Adi. </p>
