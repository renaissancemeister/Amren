			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tina Korbe, Hot Air, October 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>No matter how poorly the economy performs, no matter how many scandals surround the administration, no matter how weakly the president&rsquo;s jobs plan is received by legislators and the public, Samuel L. Jackson can see no reason why the Tea Party might oppose Barack Obama&rsquo;s reelection other than race. From an interview with <em>New York Magazine</em>:</p>
<blockquote>While we were on the subject, we asked Jackson if he agreed with fellow thespian Morgan Freeman, who caused something of a ruckus recently after he claimed that the tea party is racist. &#8220;It&rsquo;s pretty obvious what they are,&#8221; Jackson told us. &#8220;The division of the country is not about the government having too much power. I think everything right now is geared toward getting that guy out of office, whatever that means,&#8221; he said, echoing Freeman. &#8220;It&rsquo;s not politics. It is not economics. It all boils down to pretty much to race. It is a shame.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also in the Jackson interview, the actor said he wasn&rsquo;t surprised to learn of the Perry hunting camp scandal. &#8220;I grew up in the segregated South; nothing surprised me. That&rsquo;s not surprising at all.&#8221; Jackson even suggested the scandal might help Perry score points in some quarters. {snip}</p>

TEA (Tax Enough Already) Party = cut spending and reduce taxes = bad news for blacks = less white handouts = increased hollering from blacks.</p>

<p>Related news on Rickroller&rsquo;s ranch.</p>
<p>Jackson is right when he says this whole non-scandal could &#8220;help Perry score points in some quarters.&#8221;  NOT Because white people necessarily approve of a ranch once being named N****rhead, but because they&rsquo;re reacting to leftist and media treachery and race pandering.</p>

		<p>Enough of this. Celebrities should either hold their two cents to themselves, or forfeit their millions. Unless you want the windbags on Capital Hill descending to give you advice on method acting, stay out of politics.</p>
<p>And besides, no matter how you celebrities end up debasing and embarrassing yourselves with your comments, you&rsquo;ll never top the grandmother of them all, Jane Fonda. Not even blowhard Sean Penn can do that.</p>

		<p>So what will you say, Samuel, if Cain is the Republican candidate, and the Tea Partiers vote for him, but you don&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take a Tea Party for individuals to vote out Obama.</p>
<p>And by the way, why is it that black people aren&rsquo;t against taxation?  Could it possibly be that blacks don&rsquo;t pay taxes for the most part, but receive the government payouts funded by those taxes?  Duh.</p>

		<p>Well they can&rsquo;t call the TP racist anylonger. Beck and all the rest of those talk show hosts are all on board with Herman Cain now, promoting him at every turn. They want to show the world that race doesn&rsquo;t matter for being the POTUS and we all need to celebrate that a black can be President. </p>
<p>These morons could care less about what the Founders and our ancestors thought or wrote (though they sure act like it, don&rsquo;t they) as so many callers said, &#8220;in this day and age we (Whites, that is) need to get over any sort of &#8220;racism&#8221;, it is so old school&#8221;. Not a single one of them have the sense God gave them. </p>
<p>I will go a step further and call them all race TRAITORS and traitors to the idea of what America was suppose to be. No one can tell me that these talk show hosts and their callers and the TP&rsquo;ers do not KNOW or SEE that we are being race replaced in this country and yet not one peep about it from any of them.</p>
<p> They are a disgrace to the future generation of White children, or what few there will be, in this fading world. WE need to let them all know WHY we will no longer follow them or ever listen to them again. They are liars and deceivers to the core of their souls. </p>

		<p>The way to deal with comments like this from Samuel L. Jackson and Morgan Freeman is simply to boycott their movies. That is what I have done in the past when Whitney Houston and Ice Cube have made anti-white comments and had a movie. I simply refuse to go to the cinema or rent the DVD.</p>

		<p>The comments from these two are just absurd. That each political pary is in it to win is a fact, but these guys can only see race as the issue. But lets just say for a moment that the Tea Party WAS racially motivated (which we all know is not) so what? Are they going to deny the fact that blacks will vote for Obama BECAUSE he is black and no other reason? Of course they will, but that&rsquo;s ok for them, but how dare you White people vote for your own race as well! They really can&rsquo;t see how hypocritical and well&hellip; racist they sound.</p>

<p>Yes, the Tea Party protesters are are overwhelmingly white. You know who else are? The protesters in the Occupy Wall Street events currently going on in NYC and copycat cities. The young anti-capitalist lefties are just as racially non-diverse as the old anti-capitalist Tea Partiers. Michelle Malkin has even taken to calling the Occupy Wall Street kids &#8220;People of Pallor.&#8221;</p>
<p>So maybe, Mr. Jackson, it&rsquo;s not so much that the Tea Party is &#8220;a white thing,&#8221; but rather that POLITICS is a white thing. Maybe more white people are in the TP simply because more white people have political opinions, have ideologies, and are involved with the issues of the day. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Racists&#8221; means what to these guys? That most Tea Party people are White and are suspicious of Blacks and would not like to live too close to them? Well that should be true for anyone with sense. Blacks top the list of social pathologies: highest by far violent crime rate including inter-racial rape (by far), lowest IQ and academic achievement, highest discipline problems in schools, highest unemployment, etc. Any city that has a high proportion of blacks has high crime and inter-racial strife. All that is supposed to be ignored or you are a &#8220;racists&#8221;? If so then racist = realist.</p>

		<p>to #21:</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispancs in California voted against gay marriage for a number of reasons. Some of it is religous, but most of it is based on hate. Those cultures are hyper-macho and tend to hate homosexuality or anything perceived as weak and non-manly. Also, many blacks and hispanics associate &#8220;gay&#8221; with whiteness&hellip;something else they have a deep-seated hatred toward. &#8220;Gay&#8221; being a &#8220;white&#8221; thing is ridiculous, but that is how they believe. For example, Robert Mugabe imprisons, tortures and kills homosexuals. He believes that the white man brought homosexuality to Africa, and no such thing ever existed there until European colonization.  Many third world presidents believe the same myth.  My point is, you might vote against gay marriage because you believe it is immoral. They vote against gay marriage because they are full of hate, mainly against white people. They see the two groups as related.  If you ever read their blogs, you can see for yourself, this is what many of them believe. </p>

		<p>White people advocating for policies that generally benefit the white population is the reason for the scorn of the Tea Party by unhinged liberals (which is really about getting republicans to start governing like fiscal conservatives), but the push to get Obama out of office is a reaction to his performance in office by the general population. They are separate issues purposely morphed into a confusing blob of convoluted journalism. </p>
<p>Samuel Jackson&rsquo;s view is typical of the prevailing view by blacks who view jobs as lifetime appointments, and anything less than guaranteed employment is holding blacks to a higher standard than whites, and is therefore discriminatory. Judging them by their job performance is racist.      </p>

		<p>Like most of the others I don&rsquo;t spare too much time reflecting on the political opinions of actors.  Especially modern actors, most of whom (male and female) got their jobs on the casting couch and not by any stretch of the imagination on talent.</p>
<p>But it did disappoint me to read that Mr Freeman made these imbecilic remarks.  He is a generally competent actor (except when he is shoe-horned into stories he has absolutely to reason to be in, like Costner&rsquo;s ludicrous ROBIN HOOD movie) and he seemed sensible.  Oh, well.  Mr Jackson, on the other hand, is a drooling nonentity of no ability whatsoever (appearing in films by other nonentities, like the ninny Tarantino&rsquo;s)and his remarks are unworthy of any comment, pro or con.</p>
<p>As for those suggesting we boycott their films, that will be extremely easy.</p>

		<p>So, according to these two overrated &#8220;Actors&#8221;, the TEA Party is racist for objecting to their main man, and his terrible policies. </p>
<p>The TEA Party. The group that went out of its way not to bring the question of Race, and how blacks act on a daily basis, up as an issue. </p>
<p>The TEA Party people stuck to the subjects at hand, without trying to be the slightest bit devisive, unlike the Black Panthers who call us &#8220;Cracka&#8221;, &#8220;Whitey&#8221;, &#8220;Honkey&#8221;, and every other type of disparaging remark. But, that&rsquo;s OK, because their black. </p>
<p> The TEA Party went out and fought the blatant Socialism from intervening in our Medical care, to Government ownership of GM, and the Bail-outs that gave billions away to the large Corporations and Bankers. </p>
<p>I know that these two dim bulbs, like the rest of the Liberals, moaned and complained during the eight years that Bush was in Office. Was that anti-White Racism when they did it? </p>
