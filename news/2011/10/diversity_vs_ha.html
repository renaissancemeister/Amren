		<p>My parents were always adamant about trick or treating in our own neighborhood. They were not up to driving all over town on a school and work night just to collect candy unless I was invited there by a friend. I will pass out candy but as soon as I see older kids without costumes I shut down. About 25 years ago my grandparents- who almost never had tricker treaters at their rural home- had a large contingent of huge black teenagers minus costumes show up at their house. It frightened them enough that they shut their gate and turned off porch lights on Halloween to prevent future occurrences. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure that diversity has a greater impact on white children being able to trick or treat comfortably. That&rsquo;s because black boys that look about sixteen years old pound on doors for candy. I think they also focus mostly on white homes no matter how rude to them you can be. They have all the demanding aggressiveness that coddling whites have taught them.</p>
<p>They aren&rsquo;t losing out due to diversity at all.</p>

		<p>For the first time in twenty years I am not doing Halloween.  Part of the reason is as described in the article: multiple non-neighborhood kids (overwhelmingly or all Black or Hispanic) being dropped off or chauffeurred through the community.  The main reason though is that most of the drop-off children (I know the kids from my neighborhood) were not engaged in the spirit of the evening at all.  Primarily dressed in street clothes and using backpacks as a candy bag, fully half of those coming to the door actually asked for additional candy, even though we are rather generous to being with.  It was as if they were told, probably by a parent or older sibling, to do so. Otherwise, as I look down my street, it appears more and more homes in the neighborhood are also turning out the lights on this once really neat holiday.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s interesting, I&rsquo;m writing this comment from a Starbucks in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NYC.  Yes, Brooklyn.  But because the neighborhood is overwhelmingly Polish, all the kids are out Treak or Treating.  It&rsquo;s lovely to see them with their costumes; they get so excited.  Lots of mirth in air&hellip;but very little &#8220;diversity,&#8221; it must be said. </p>

		<p>This article is spot on. I don&rsquo;t even give candy out anymore. It&rsquo;s not worth it when the only kids coming to your door are thugs in training with costumes from the dollar store and sometimes actual teenage thugs who don&rsquo;t even bother to put on a costume, but expect some free candy anyway. </p>
<p>When my kids were younger, I had to drive them to other neighborhoods, not because my neighborhood was too diverse, but because my neighbors, like me, tired of giving candy out to the freeloading kids that poured in by car from the low rent apartment complexes nearby. Though my neighborhood was over 90 percent White, we couldn&rsquo;t prevent the ungrateful ghetto kids from showing up. Eventually on Halloween, everyone&rsquo;s front porch lights went dark. We were run out of our own neighborhood on Halloween.</p>

		<p>This is true. I am seeing this tonight as I pass out candy. My city is 90% White but so far the Trick-or-Treaters have been at least 60% Black. Even their kids are coming to our neighborhood for handouts&hellip;</p>

		<p>What makes a neighborhood &#8220;bad&#8221;?  Often, it consists of the same brick abodes where whites once lived lives of grace and faith.  And drank the same water.  I bought an old pair of Quad electrostatics from a nice fellow in Virginia Highland a couple of years ago.  It is not a neighborhood in which I would care to reside.</p>

<p>I understand this completely.  It&rsquo;s so depressing living in my 70% non-white &#8220;community&#8221; that I rarely leave the house once I&rsquo;m home from work.  I even order my groceries to be delivered!  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not crime or noise that bothers me (no blacks in my neighborhood), it&rsquo;s the feeling of societal failure and community decay lingering in the air.  Trying to enjoy myself in my area is like picnicking on the deck of the Titanic.  <br>

		<p>No surprise here.  Last year there were news articles about how whites were racist for not giving rides to and from the ghettos for underprivileged kids.  Whites got on there and complained about 8 year old black kids harassing little white kids, changing costumes for all the good houses so they could hit it several times, vandalism, and threatening home owners with violence (yes, still 8 year olds) for more candy.</p>
<p>And people are shocked whites want to live in white communities.  This is only one of thousands of reasons why. </p>

<p>&#8220;Griffin said some neighborhoods in the African-American community were in such high-crime areas that Halloween usually went unacknowledged.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Detroit and Flint seem to have no problem acknowledging Devil&rsquo;s Night. Ghetto blacks may not be able to accomplish safe trick-or-treating, but they sure know how to set vacant houses on fire for seasonal entertainment purposes. </p>

		<p>*I started to realize how different Halloween is for inner city kids in Milwaukee a few years ago after hearing from suburbanites who wanted to know why so many black kids were showing up at their doors asking for candy.</p>
<p>Ah yes, this happened in my neighborhood every Holloween - ten year old Buick Electras and Cadillac Coupe De Villes with wide white walls and curb scrappers unloading their 15 year old, 6ft. tall &#8220;children&#8221; to go trick-or-treating while their baby momma/baby daddy stood at the car scowling at the White people. When they came to the door, they would just shove the bag out - no smile, no saying &#8220;trick-or-treat&#8221;, then they&rsquo;d just turn and walk away never saying thank-you or anything! My dad, being the the PC man he is - ha-ha, got to where he would only put candy in the White kids bags then close the door! </p>

		<p>There are many good points made in this article.  However, it is also a growing trend to hold Halloween activities at schools, and in our small city, the shopping mall has a host of activities and many kids go there with their parents.  </p>
<p>We stopped taking part, handing out candy this year.  Reasons are, 1. We never got many kids at all.  2.  We learned last year that the few kids on our street go to &#8220;prime neighborhoods,&#8221; even though this is a 90% white neighborhood.  3.  I really don&rsquo;t like handing out candy to increasingly obese children.  4.  Kids are becoming worse as Halloween &#8220;guests,&#8221; and teens often take part.  In my view, 13 years is too old.  Halloween parties are for everyone, but going door to door is for children.</p>

		<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that run counter to Putnam&rsquo;s findings?</p>
<p>This is a very important sentence right here.  Because the article is not talking about diversity.  It&rsquo;s not talking about people not like yourself.  It&rsquo;s talking about black people and trying very hard not to identify the problem as being, and always have being black people.  Eventually, the US will ethnically cleanse mexicans and other recent parasites to come to our country.  But that will not solve the problem.</p>
<p>What will solve the problem is re-assertion of the right for whites to live in exclusively white neighborhoods.  In other words, to arrest (or shoot&hellip;.depending on the circumstances) blacks on sight.</p>

		<p>I live in an affluent, mostly white neighborhood that lies not far from several large pockets of diversity.  From my front door, one could walk half a mile and, culturally speaking, enter Latin America. Their neighborhoods are apparently too dangerous for the children to go trick or treating, so they come into my neighborhood (apparently by the busload from the looks of things).</p>
<p>This year I almost decided to dress up as an immigration officer, hide in the bushes, wait for them to approach, and then jump out and yell &#8220;LA MIGRA!&#8221;</p>

		<p>This article is very timely and apt. It is quite true that some people choose to travel with their children to white neighborhoods in order to go trick or treating in safety even though they do not reside there.</p>
<p>Another big change is that oftentimes adults accompany children. Years ago, only the smallest kids were chaperoned, but now parents do not think that their children will be safe without supervision.  </p>

		<p>My neighborhood passes the test!  Of course, I don&rsquo;t live in Detroit anymore!  Where I lived on the east side of Detroit, back in the 1970s, was 99% white, safe, clean and we did trick or treat.  There were many white churches with Boy Scout meetings in the basements, summer programs, lots of little businesses and shops.  </p>
<p>That area is now 90% black.  The only whites are the elderly who can&rsquo;t afford to move or don&rsquo;t have enough sense to move.  Only black churches, no Boy Scouts of course.  Burned out houses and a high percentage of section 8 renters, crime and failing schools. </p>
<p>We keep moving to stay a few steps ahead of the blacks.  I wonder if Obama will give us reparations for being displaced from our child-hood neighborhoods?    </p>

		<p>This is so typical of Blacks.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;As it turned out, a local church had been giving kids rides out to the suburbs for years so they would be safe during trick-or-treating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Have a Dream&rdquo; speech he should have said, &ldquo;I have a dream where Blacks will do absolutely nothing for themselves and just take and take and take from White people.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>Die-versity makes Halloween too dangerous for white children and for that matter white adults for traditions such as trick or treat. White children are subject to violence from non-white thugs, sex offenders and gangs, and allowing them a look into whites&rsquo; homes invites deadly home invasions too. Trick or treating is dying out, because of non-whites, children and their parents now celebrate Halloween at venues away from home where they can both watch over their kids and avoid inviting burglaries, home invasions and worse.</p>

		<p>What to say?  It is the same as every year for about 30 or so years now.  Fewer and fewer white kids are Trick or Treating since there are just plainly fewer white kids.  The majority of kids coming to my house this Halloween were black children.  This in a neighborhood that is about 95% white.  And as always, they come from the &#8220;bad&#8221; neighborhoods, i.e. black ghetto, with the same sense of entitlement.  As the years have gone by, fewer houses take the time to decorate.  And no one, will convert their homes to a haunted house and invite all in to experience a Halloween specialty that seems to have passed away along with my 1960s youth.  Many, especially the elderly have gone to just putting a receptacle with candy on the front porch.  Then there are those afraid to even allow these strangers on the property - they close the frontroom drapes, shut the lights and pray they will be left alone.</p>
<p>It is interesting and sad that this &#8220;Halloween&#8221; cultural or sociological observation is nothing more to some people than a compilation of data.  Being more than that, it is the study of death.  Death of ideals, death of morality and of the very meaning of existence.  That is what Halloween is, a complex entity that when studied defines the absolute destruction of a way of life, an American way of life.  And it is the pain that we, from a spledid past now suffer, that we finally understand its meaning  but can&rsquo;t do a damn thing about it.</p>

		<p>Sign of the times: The local school district here hosts a &#8220;Trunk Or Treat&#8221; night, where only those parents who have kids enrolled in the school, submit to a criminal background check, and pay a fee per car can participate with their kids, and one guest. I think its kind of innovative stop-gap to still give the kids some experience of the event. People go all out to decorate their cars, and it provides a safe place for the interaction among whites. </p>
<p>Truck Or Treat bypasses the whole door to door thing, and keeps the riff raff out. The event originally started out as a response to the problems of crossing some of the major roads here which divide subdivisions, but has pretty much become an all white event as the neighborhood has become more diverse even though we are quite suburban, and still 89% range of whiteness as a community. That this event is all white is a reflection on who those blacks are that have moved into the area recently. HUD has been trying to do a major makeover on my area, and more than half of the black families in my area are beneficiaries of HUD help. They simply wont pay, or submit to the criminal background check for trunk-or-treat. </p>
<p>While the closed-circle type event does have advantages, it also comes with costs. While white people get to socialize with other whites, and enjoy some diversity free fun they don&rsquo;t necessarily get to know their immediate neighbors. </p>

		<p>Here in Germany, Halloween is getting a little more popular.  We get a few trick-or-treaters each year.  All white.  How nice! </p>
<p>If I lived in the US and an ignorant church group started bussing in blacks for another handout, I would  stop passing out candy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;How many parents live in cities where they don&rsquo;t feel safe sending their kids out into the night to Trick or Treat? &#8220;</p>
<p>I know we do not. My wife&rsquo;s family has lived in this house since 1986 and in that time we have been overwhelming blessed with diversity. This neighborhood has gone from white, middle-class suburbia to a suburban ghetto which is probably at least 75% black. For a time we took our daughters trick or treating in my wife&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; new neighborhood but in the last 2 years we have become fans of these &#8220;trunk or treating&#8221; events you now find at many traditional, protestant churches (We been going to one at a local LCMS parish where my daughter attends school). Unfortunately last year a local black dominated christian school closed and this school / church got a large influx of blacks, so it may not last. Last night I saw far more blacks than last year. One odd thing was, they mostly had white adults with them. I don&rsquo;t know what that&rsquo;s all about.</p>

		<p>I also noticed that quite a few homes in my neighborhood were not passing out candy some even had &#8220;no candy&#8221; signs. For some reason there were fewer trick or treaters either. I think events like &#8220;trunk or treat&#8221; at businesses or churches took many kids off the streets this year.</p>

<p>A few years ago the number of blacks visiting my neighborhood sky-rocketed.  And it wasn&rsquo;t just the unrulely children demanding candy, it was 35 40 45 nasty unruley grand baby mommies and three time over 20 year old baby mommies with the kids demanding it as well. </p>

<p>* Some of the &#8220;youth&#8221; might be casing the homes out so they can <br>
come back later and rob them.</p>
<p>* Black kids must learn at a very early age to have negative opinions about each other. They must leave their own neighborhoods and go to &#8220;racist&#8221; white areas to be treated well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be G-d d-nm-d if I&rsquo;ll be a hostage in my own house! I turn off the lights, close the drapes, and go about my business. But if a gang of these &#8220;yoots&#8221; were to knock on my door anyway, they&rsquo;d be met by a homeowner with a pistol on his belt, three German Shepherds with &#8220;radar lock&#8221; on the  front door, and a frosty &#8220;Sorry, gentlemen, nothing here you&rsquo;d want. Have a nice night.&#8221; If they stayed, I&rsquo;d give the hand signal to the dogs to &#8220;sound off like ya got a pair!&#8221; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had to do it twice. Other than Halloween, I had a group of yoots pretending to sell raffle tickets for the local high school football team (which had a bunch of overage ghetto imports to ensure a winning season, but that&rsquo;s another story altogether).</p>

<p>White do-gooders, unfortunately.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s some sort of &#8220;adopt a family&#8221; type program for Halloween - whites recruited to ferry around black ghetto kids so their single mothers can go party in a club.  <br>

<p>That could be. There were 5-10 kids with white adults whose avg age was probably 60, couples mostly a couple women alone (at least I didn&rsquo;t see a man with her)<br>
I didn&rsquo;t even know churches did that sort of thing, bus the little chimps into decent neighborhoods I know my church doesn&rsquo;t do it, thank God.</p>

		<p>When I was a kid in the 70&rsquo;s we didn&rsquo;t have to leave our neighborhood for candy and prizes. Though it was quite small most of the neighbors would always have candy to hand out and it was great time for adults to get out and interact with each other while at the same time insuring their children&rsquo;s safety and it was great family together memories. It always started just after dark and we would be done before 9:00 P.M. with enough candy for a month. Usually an older sibling would pass out the treats for the parents and would still have time to go be with their friends after we got home.<br>
It was just a blue collar, middle class community where everyone got along, and it was all white.<br>
In the 80&rsquo;s Section 8 housing was introduced and everything went to hell, to see my old stomping grounds now breaks my heart, it is a ghetto.<br>
If my upraising is considered white privileged then I am proud for it to be so when I can think back on memories being as good as it was then.</p>

<p>I know what they&rsquo;ll do; they&rsquo;ll go down to the permanent OWS encampments, which by then will constitute a new kind of professional skid row that receives donations from the government and corporations for reminding everyone that things are rotten all around.  I bet lots of people will have coupled up there by then, and have OWS children that will carry on the great work.  No doubt, corps, Bill Gates, and George Soros will donate costumes and candy every October 31st so that they can experience Halloween, just like the bourgeois and rich they detest.</p>

		<p> 15 Shot, 2 Killed in New Orleans Halloween Mayhem <br>
Monday was a bloody night in the Crescent City. Gunfire erupted at four scenes during Halloween celebrations, leaving 15 people shot, and two dead. <br>
Reporter: From CBS News, Posted by Ralph Hipp </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Font Size:    NEW ORLEANS (CBS/ WWL-TV)   &mdash;   It was a bloody night in the Crescent City. In the midst of Halloween celebrations, gunfire erupted at four scenes, leaving 15 people shot, and two dead.</p>
<p>The first incident occurred just after midnight on Bourbon Street in the famous French Quarter. Police believe two men began firing at one another, striking a total of eight people during the exchange.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Officer Garry Flot said one of of those shot on Bourbon was killed. That victim, 25-year-old Albert Glover, died at the hospital. Another one of the victims was shot in the hip and the others suffered non-life threatening injuries, police said.</p>
<p>As horrified people began running for cover, others in the massive crowd were oblivious to what was going on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were all upstairs having a good time,&#8221; said Rob Ratcher of North Carolina. &#8220;It sounded like firecrackers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly before 2 a.m., police were responded to another French Quarter shooting where two men and two women were shot - one person in that group was killed.</p>
<p>Police arrested Baltiman Malcom, 24, moments after a fatal shooting that left a 19-year-old Joshua Lewis dead and 3 others injured, according to police. Police chased Malcom and finally detained him and another suspect, though a third escaped, said a statement from the New Orleans Police Department.</p>
<p>The officers also found a gun at the scene. In the statement, NOPD attributed the incident to &#8220;an argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malcom was booked with one count of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to police.</p>
<p>But the night was not yet over. Two more shootings, one around 4 a.m. and another around 5:30am left three more people shot and wounded<br>

<p>Her husband said that every year they are part of a program that brings poor underprivileged harlem thugs to their wealthy White neighborhood for trick or treat.  Every year the Hedges family buys $500 or $600 worth of candy for the black and brown victims of evil Whitey.</p>
<p>The woman is in harlem hospital, one of the worst hospitals in the country.  People who work there staple cards to their insurance cards that say Do not take me to harlem hospital in case of emergency.  They also tell next of kin to get them out of harlem hospital if they ever end up there.</p>
<p>She is a pretty White woman with long blond hair.  The black female nurses will abuse her as black women do when they have a White woman in their power.  </p>

A woman nearly killed by a free-fall shopping cart at an East Harlem mall was there on a mission of human kindness. The victim, the New York Post reports, had just bought Halloween treats for underprivileged children when two misguided 12-year-olds dropped the cart onto her from four stories above. The two perpetrators are now in police custody.</p>
<p>The woman, Marion Salmon Hedges, is a Manhattan real-estate agent with a long history of philanthropy. In 2006, she was named &ldquo;Outstanding Volunteer&rdquo; by the Junior League, an organization dedicated to improving communities through volunteerism and building members&rsquo; civic leadership skills through training.</p>
<p>After she was struck on Sunday, Hedges was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where she is now in a medically induced coma. Her chances of recovery are unknown at this point. </p>
<p>The boys responsible for her condition were said by police to be smiling, telling jokes, and laughing after they were taken into custody. The Post notes that at one point, one of the suspects &ldquo;Raymond Hernandez of Harlem started crying like a baby &mdash; but clearly only because he got caught, not because he felt any remorse for leaving the victim near death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An eyewitness at the scene told police that the two boys were part of a larger group of hooligans tossing Slushees over the 3-1/2-foot-high railing of a parking-level walkway outside a Target store. &ldquo;They were just doing it for fun,&rdquo; the witness said.</p>
<p>Once Hernandez and the second suspect, Jeovanni Rosario, also of Harlem, turned their attention to shopping carts, a third friend reportedly advised them against throwing projectiles that size but they would not be deterred. After the cart they hurled found its target, the boys ran, but police were able to identify them through tips from sources.</p>
<p>The two suspects were charged in Family Court with assault as juveniles. Friends of both boys&rsquo; families insist that they are &ldquo;good kids.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Do you remember the case some years ago of a White man who was giving out candy on Halloween and his little dog went missing? I don&rsquo;t think they ever found the poor thing. He was distraught and it was all over the news. I believe this happened in Philadelphia. Gee, I wonder who the trick or treaters were?</p>
<p>The worst things I can remember happening on Halloween were teens stuffing mailboxes with toilet paper(clean)and soaping windows.</p>
<p>Gee, those days sure were boring, no arsons, no shootings, no thugs from the hood stealing people&rsquo;s little dogs. </p>

<p>At 56 years I now believe that it is suicide to give anyone anything.  To go out to get something requires further exposure to the miscreant population, to go and deliver requires more.  Once they get it they hate your guts.  After they have it they start to plan on how to hurt you for giving it to them.</p>

		<p>Our neighborhood has some non-whites, but below the critical mass necessary to ruin it.  Like many these days, trick or treating is usually accompanied by parents, usually watching from the sidewalk or even an idling car.  My 3 year old was taken out by his mother.</p>
<p>A neighboring development is heavily black.  Halloween night a group of blacks stole the basket of candy my wife had left on the front porch, meant for the honor system until I got home and was able to answer the door.  Later, I answered the door to another pack of blacks, which peered about google eyed at our home and then noted the fact that I was wearing a suit, having just gotten in from the office.  &#8220;Are you the butler?&#8221; asked one.  Apparently wearing a suit is that alien to them&hellip;</p>
