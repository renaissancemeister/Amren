			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol Morello and Dan Keating, Washington Post, October 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Around the region and across the country, the archetypal all-white neighborhood is vanishing with remarkable speed. In many places, the phenomenon is not being driven by African Americans moving to the suburbs. Instead, it is primarily the result of the nation&rsquo;s soaring number of Hispanics and Asians, many of whom are immigrants.</p>
<p>The result has been the emergence of neighborhoods, from San Diego to Denver to Miami, that are more diverse than at any time in American history.</p>
<p>As the nation barrels toward the day, just three decades from now, when non-Hispanic whites are expected to be a minority, these global neighborhoods have already begun remaking the American social fabric in significant ways. Their creation and impact have been especially pronounced in the Washington area, where minorities are now the majority.</p>
<p>A Washington Post analysis of 2010 Census data shows a precipitous decline in the number of the region&rsquo;s census tracts, areas of roughly 2,000 households, where more than 85 percent of the residents are of the same race or ethnicity  &mdash;  what many demographers would consider a segregated neighborhood.</p>
<p>In the District, just one in three neighborhoods is highly segregated, the Post analysis found. A decade ago, more than half were.</p>
<p>In the Maryland suburbs, one in five neighborhoods is dominated by one race or ethnicity, down from almost a third in 2000.</p>
<p>The biggest drop has been in Northern Virginia, where only one in 20 neighborhoods is a racial or ethnic enclave. No suburb is more diverse than Fairfax County, where just 2 percent of neighborhoods are segregated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black and white</p>
<p>But some of Washington&rsquo;s black communities are being bypassed as diversity sweeps through the region.</p>
<p>Wards 7 and 8 in the District are virtually all African American, and many of the neighborhoods have become even more segregated. As a result, more than half the city&rsquo;s black residents live in segregated neighborhoods, while almost no whites do.</p>
<p>More striking is what&rsquo;s happening in Prince George&rsquo;s County, one of the few places in the country that is simultaneously growing in size and growing more segregated as whites leave and the black middle class shifts to the suburbs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As recently as 1990, whites in the Washington area were more likely than blacks to live in enclaves. Now the positions are switched.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s two contradictory trend lines are playing out nationwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a glass-half-full-half-empty story,&#8221; said the Urban Institute&rsquo;s Margery Turner, an expert on housing patterns. &#8220;Predominantly white neighborhoods are no longer as homogeneous as in the past. They&rsquo;ve opened up tremendously. And yet, white people are, in general, not moving into neighborhoods that are predominantly black. Majority black neighborhoods are remaining majority black, or becoming more majority black, at the same time white neighborhoods are opening up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Demographers contend that Americans still live primarily among people who are like them. Much of their evidence comes from places such as Milwaukee and Detroit that have stopped growing or are shrinking. These places, mostly in the Midwest and Northeast, have not attracted the Hispanics and Asians fueling growth and diversity elsewhere.</p>
<p>John Logan, a sociologist at Brown University who coined the phrase &#8220;global neighborhoods&#8221; to describe the changes he has been studying for three decades, said the typical pattern is for Asians and Hispanics to move into white neighborhoods, paving the way for white acceptance of more blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Logan noted that it is still rare for whites to move into minority neighborhoods, and white flight continues to shape many communities.</p>
<p>Washington is a case study in how the arrival of Hispanics and Asians is altering the country. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 whites in the region still live in neighborhoods where they are at least a plurality, if not a majority. But the neighborhoods where more than 85 percent of residents are white are growing rare.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Logan said the rest of the country will catch up to Washington eventually.</p>
<p>&#8220;As whites are a smaller share of the population, inevitably what it means is whites are more and more going to share communities with other groups,&#8221; Logan said. &#8220;The all-white neighborhood is being re-created on the far periphery of metropolitan areas. But aside from that, it&rsquo;s becoming a thing of the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The rise of global neighborhoods can create upheaval and tension.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Often, though, the flare-ups are not over hot-button political issues but over mundane matters such as parking, trash and the language of newsletters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a cultural gap,&#8221; said Maria DaSilva, who immigrated to the United States in 1965 from Brazil and is active in her civic association in Wheaton. &#8220;We have people who have been in the community for 40 to 50 years  &mdash;  and a wave of new people  &mdash;  who practice the way they lived in their country of origin.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Demographers have found that there are still tipping points, where the increasing presence of one ethnic group makes the other groups feel uneasy, though much of the research focuses on the dynamics of whites and blacks.</p>
<p>Roderick Harrison, a Howard University sociologist and former head of racial statistics at the Census Bureau, said studies show that whites start to abandon a neighborhood when blacks exceed 30 percent. That&rsquo;s the same point, however, where blacks start to feel comfortable in a neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;They feel vulnerable&#8221; when it&rsquo;s less than 30 percent, Harrison said. &#8220;You want to see people like you at the supermarket.&#8221;</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br>
Don&rsquo;t these two sentences sum it up perfectly? Blacks can live in all-black communities because no people from other ethnic groups would want to be there, while whites can never live in all-white communities because non-whites know that such white homogeneity means more prosperous, peaceful, and overall enjoyable surroundings. Trouble is as the neighbourhoods become less white, the very reasons the non-whites moved there in the first place get watered down real fast.</p>

		<p>Whites feeling increasingly vulnerable physically, economically, politically, sexually, culturally and socially will reach a tipping point sooner than later. They will likely abandon vast sections of the U.S. and other former homelands to form new ones and enclaves where non-whites will not be welcome. It&rsquo;s time for whites to assert themselves in their own house, and to tell these unwanted newcommers that we are offended that they are offended over our culture, language and heritage. Why should we be the only ones forced to live among others who hate, mistrust, exploit, abuse, violate, assault, rape, kill and despise us?</p>

		<p>The community my family and I lived in, in the 1960s was predominately Jewish.  It was at least 65% Jewish I think.  Now it truly is international.  Hispanics, Vietnamese, Jamaican, Haitian, Philippines.  My parents are pretty much the only Caucasians on the street.  People are kind. It is a friendly street, but the demographics have definitely changed.  When I was a kid, the people next door were Jewish, the two houses across the street were Jewish, the next door neighbor on the other side was Seventh Day Adventist, and the house next to them was Jewish. Some time in the 1980s there was a major White Flight, with many of the Jewish families moving to Potomac.  It could be looked at as a step up, financially, or a way of finding good Jewish schools, but I think it was also an example of flight from diversity.  Those who remained, were often homeowners whose kids had already grown up and left.  And so they are spending their golden years in a very different type of neighborhood.   I am not saying it is good or bad, but it is very different.  Q.  </p>

<p>No, they don&rsquo;t!  That&rsquo;s nonsense.  They want to shop where YOU shop. Just as they want to live where YOU live, and they want to go to school where YOU go to school, etc.</p>
<p>I know blacks who refuse to shop in a black area.  They go out of their way to shop in white neighborhoods.  They are convinced that whites get all the best stuff and that black supermarkets get all the  rotten junk. You can&rsquo;t tell them otherwise.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to see too many blacks around them. Thet&rsquo;s the reason they keep expanding into white areas. They move away from other blacks just as whites do. </p>

		<p>While I find this article more of the same old white flight carbon copy, I&rsquo;ll address a few of my favorite lines for fun that remind my of my time in Detroit.  Notice how there is no complaint for Hispanics or Asians to move into black neighborhoods, only whites. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Predominantly white neighborhoods are no longer as homogeneous as in the past. They&rsquo;ve opened up tremendously. And yet, white people are, in general, not moving into neighborhoods that are predominantly black. Majority black neighborhoods are remaining majority black, or becoming more majority black, at the same time white neighborhoods are opening up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course they aren&rsquo;t, they want to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to see people like you at the supermarket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that is perfectly okay as long as you are white.</p>
<p>And I lived in Fairfax, VA for 6 months for work.  If you can stand the traffic, drive across the city and visit Prince George County, or the &#8220;PGC&#8221; as the locals call it.  Reminds my of how Ecorse/River Rouge is (not quite Detroit) and Southfield is heading towards (for all you Southeast Michigan residents).</p>
<p>So far I have seen a few amren comments on the original article.  Keep it up.  If those &#8220;progressives&#8221; will not come here to read our comments, put them there to drown out the &#8220;anti racists&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t believe it, people.  Segregation is still with us, thankfully.  Cities might be more racially diverse, but neighborhoods are not, and that&rsquo;s what counts.  Check out a census map and you&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<p>The leftist White media constantly celebrates the death of Whites and western civilization as though a great demon has been slain. On the surface, it defies all logic, but in reality, it really doesn&rsquo;t require much perception to realize that it&rsquo;s all based on changes in the commerce model.</p>
<p>Mestizos, Middle Easterners, and, of course, chronically-dependent Africans are willing to pay much more for much less. They don&rsquo;t have to be plied and wooed with warranties, money back guarantees, high-quality, and good customer services. They are very likely to buy on impulse and frivilously spend every penny that they have.</p>
<p>Consequently, high-quality products, designed and produced by Whites, are becoming increasingly less necessary. All that is required are a few Whites with brains to conceive of a product, design it, and create a way to mass produce it with very little brain-power required.</p>
<p>Between that and cheap imports from Asia, Whites are the odd man out in the new global economy that thrives on dumb, er, intellectually-challenged patrons and workers.<br>

<p>Lester Maddox&rsquo;s Pickrick Restaurant location is now deep within the borders of Ga. Tech.  The sacred and historic building was recently torn down and is now a grass lot awaiting a historical maker from Civil Rights icon and leader John Lewis.  Look for lots of tear jerking rhetoric about the pain of segregation.  Maddox closed his restaurant instead of allowing the Fed. Govt. tell him who he must serve.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atlantatimemachine.com/misc/maddox.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantatimemachine.com/misc/maddox.htm</a> </p>
<p>When he did serve, his clientele was from the 100% White working class neighborhood of Home Park and Hemphill Ave.</p>
<p>Now, Home Park is the site of repeated African American attacks on Ga. Tech students.  Diversity is our what?</p>
<p>The violence problem is so continually bad, Atlanta&rsquo;s liberal Journal and Constitution is now succumbing to frustration and leaning toward asking the unmentionable questions:</p>
<p><br>
http://goo.gl/IVqCg</p>
<p>Is crime at Ga. Tech an urban reality? <br>
Robberies, assaults persist despite efforts by officials to stifle the trend. </p>
<p><br>
snip</p>
<p>Officials at Tech and other schools have responded to the incidents with stepped-up patrols, courtesy shuttles, self-defense classes and other efforts to educate students about the dangers of in-town living. Yet, Tech students continue to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s a very difficult question to answer,&#8221; said Sgt. Curtis Davenport, an Atlanta Police Department spokesman. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know if anyone knows why. I do know that we are taking steps to try and prevent [crimes] and arrest those responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>end snip</p>
<p>NOBODY KNOWS WHY THE BLACKS ATTACK GA. TECH STUDENTS!</p>
<p>snip</p>
<p>The challenge for campus police is two-fold. Students are often impulsive, immature and naive, and urban campuses are frequently placed alongside low-income neighborhoods. &#8220;Many of our students had a false sense of security,&#8221; said Thomas Trawick, chief of police and director of emergency management at Clark Atlanta University.</p>
<p>end snip</p>
<p><br>
Low-income neighborhoods that were once Whites Only neighborhoods = Diversity = violent crime.</p>
<p>Constant &#8220;Diversity is our strength&#8221; propaganda from Ga. Tech = students have a false sense of security.   </p>
<p>If Techies still have any sense of security at all after the long trending rash of attacks near and on campus, then they deserve it as bad as the afrovoodoos can give it.</p>
<p>Diversity = crime = urban reality. Just go ahead and adjust yourself and suffer, because if you speak up, you&rsquo;ll be branded a vile klux racist who stigmatizes minorities with lies that stoke hate and violence. You will end up on the SPLC&rsquo;s Hate Watch list, and the ADL will force your employer to fire you.  The NAACP will march on your business, and your local neighborhood thugs will be anointed by the MSM as the suffering saints of the ongoing struggle for civil and human rights.<br>

		<p>This article is VERY misleading in its portrayal of the DC area.  What it conveniently fails to take into account is that there ARE super-white areas here in DC metro, and that those areas are, without exception, oppressively liberal.  Conveniently using the 85% barometer, the article skirts the fact that there are, count &#8216;em, 9 census tracts just WITHIN THE DISTRICT that are over 80% white (3 of which are plus-85%).  <br>

Moving out to Arlington where I live, we find at least 7 census districts that are over 85% white, and many more that are 80+.  In fact, out of the 40-something census tracts in all of Arlington County, only two have a black plurality, and three a Hispanic plurality.  In the Maryland suburbs, there are 8 tracts over 85% white.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the most appropriate title for this article should be &#8220;Surrender, Resistance is Futile!&#8221;.  This propaganda piece is typical of the race based psych-ops that permeates the Sunday Washington Post.  In the print edition it dominated the first page with a large picture, and covered almost two full pages in the first section of the paper.  I suppose there was no more important news to cover that day than the decline of the white population in the Wash. D.C. metropolitan area, which implicit in the Post&rsquo;s writing is a cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Of course, per the WP there is little or no downside to this rather brutal demographic change.  And be assured that if you are the last white &ldquo;Ice&rdquo; people on the block, crippled and old to boot, that your wonderful multicultural neighbors will look after you pending your demise thus completing the blessed transition to the &ldquo;Sun&rdquo; people.</p>

<p>The neighborhoods in this story will follow it too. The Whites will be driven out and eventually the neighborhoods will become all black or all Hispanic etc.</p>

 John Logan, sociologist at Brown University uses the phrase global neighborhoods. </p>
<p> Whether he realizes it or not, he sees this global racial and ethnic hodgepodge through the prism of a white person living in North America. Europeans and Australians are the same way.  </p>
<p> Non- white nations throughout the world emphasize, if not demand, racial/ethnic homogeneity for themselves. </p>
<p> Roderick Harrison of Howard university says blacks feel vulnerable when their numbers are below 30 percent. Well of course they no longer feel vulnerable at this point, they are in the process of taking over as white- flight picks up steam!  </p>
<p>  Mr. Harrison doesn&rsquo;t care if he makes whites uncomfortable and drives them out. He&rsquo;s in it for his people,- he black.</p>
<p> Several final points: The threshold for white tolerance of blacks and to a lesser degree Hispanics in the Northeast and Midwest (suburbs) is much less than 30% mentioned in the article.</p>
<p><br>
 Next, overwhelmingly white communities in these regions are not becoming &#8220;rare&#8221; as was alluded to. But I must say the overall national trends are not encouraging, I&rsquo;ll say that much. </p>
<p> And what do these sociologists mean when they say neighborhoods? When I hear this term applied I think of an urban demographic. Meaning, certain sections, or streets within a city but not suburbs or rural areas where the &#8220;whole community itself&#8221; is determined to be overwhelmingly white,-or not. Applying the term &#8220;neighborhoods&#8221; to non- urban demographics is a misapplication.</p>

		<p>One cannot help but sense the almost victorious, triumphant, and celebratory tone this article takes when describing how whites are being displaced from neighborhoods they have lived in probably for decades.  The picture at the source tops it off. We have youthful and vibrant Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics running aged whites out of their neighborhoods, with the white elderly smiling as they are driven out of their homesteads. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. </p>
<p>&ldquo;They feel vulnerable&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s less than 30 percent, Harrison said. &ldquo;You want to see people like you at the supermarket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see&hellip;it&rsquo;s perfectly acceptable for blacks to &#8220;feel vulnerable&#8221; when the minority and desire to see people like &#8220;themselves&#8221; when at the supermarket. Whites are allowed no such feelings and are called &ldquo;bigots and racists&rdquo; if they dare express a desire to see people like &ldquo;themselves&rdquo; at the supermarket. </p>

		<p>I remember when Miami was still 50% White &#8216;Anglo&rsquo; in the late 1980s (As recently as the 1950s, Miami was 85% White). Then the White population fell off a cliff in the 1990s and 2000s, and now rests somewhere between 18-20% in Miami-Dade County. However, unlike anywhere else in the country, where most Hispanics look like Mayan or Azteca warriors, there are a lot of White Cubans and South Americans living in Miami who are pure blood European.<br>

<p>I wonder if the two are related: once blacks stop feeling &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and start feeling &#8220;comfortable&#8221;, they start acting the way they want to, and not the way they felt they had to due to perceived vulnerability. Then, when whites see blacks acting as blacks, esp among other blacks, and see how that changes the character of the neighborhood (Ebonics, rowdy behavior, parties and/or loud music at all hours of the night, increased crime and intimidation of whites), the whites flee.</p>

		<p>You are right Mr. Harrison. I, as a White male, do feel vulnerable when the black community around me is less than 30%.  I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable if it&rsquo;s 10%. I&rsquo;ve got hundreds of thousands of reasons to believe this. Read the internet crime report sometimes. </p>
<p>And to the woman who wonders why Whites don&rsquo;t want any parts of black neighborhoods? Please don&rsquo;t be so coy. We as AmReners, are more aware of our race than most Whites.

it is impossible to find someone to sue.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the asian landlords who have reduced the black population of San Francisco from 11 percent to 5 percent.  Unless blacks can find a White seller and buy their own homes or get into the projects, they have no hope of finding housing in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The persians in my Los Angeles neighborhood are building condos all over.  They sell only to Whites.  They don&rsquo;t discriminate in favor of persian Whites.

		<p>I&rsquo;m always interested in the lingo of the Dominant internationalist Idealogy as presented in the MSM. &#8220;Globalized Neighborhood&#8221; is a new term. Global intergration is to be pushed on the Macro and Micro scale. They will be trying to globalize White regions, neighborhoods, towns, provinces, including places like rural Slovakia or rural Wyoming. Funny. No one cares if neighborhoods in Taipei, Seoul, Tokyo, or Shanghai aren&rsquo;t &#8220;globalized&#8221;.

		<p>It seems to me that by the point where blacks are 30% of a neighborhood, you are in a situation equivalent to 1939 for Jews in Germany:  TOO LATE TO GET OUT.</p>
<p>Too late to get out with much of your home&rsquo;s equity, that is.  Probably too late to have avoided the Random Diversity Tax (smashed windows in your cars, burglaries&hellip;).</p>
<p>In my experience, 10% is a better rule of thumb for when people begin to flee (the smart money having sold their homes at top dollar and fled at 5%).</p>
<p>People ask me why we still have rooms full of unopened boxes from our last several moves. They wonder why we don&rsquo;t buy furniture for those rooms, and move the boxes to the gargantuan attics in this house.  But more furniture will just weigh us down.  We&rsquo;re afraid to put down roots&hellip; to become attached&hellip;to make packing take any longer than we need to.  Schlepping boxes down attic stairs will take too long.  An extra trip for the van for extra furniture will take more money&hellip;more time&hellip; We want to be the first ones out.  We&rsquo;re tired of surrendering Equity to Diversity.  (okay&hellip;we&rsquo;ve always been within the first 10% to flee&hellip;and have always gotten our money out.  But still&hellip; the Early 5% usually makes money).</p>

		<p>Poster #18 said: &#8220;Eventually when hispanics reach a certain percentage(albeit probably a higher one than the 30% black percentage), the whites will leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -  It is so true.  I drive through many neighborhoods that are now 100% latino.  You see all the buildings that were built by white people, the street names etc, and all you see are full blooded amerindians who resemble aztecs, mayas and assorted indian tribes of mesoamerica and south america.  It is so sad.  </p>
<p>No white people live in those places, and I&rsquo;ve been passing along on those streets for years now.  I think that even though latinos are not as violent as &#8216;africans&rsquo; white people are more tolerant of blacks being in the majority than latinos.  </p>
<p>How can I say this?  Because in any majority black area, you will see a few older white faces here and there.  Latinos bring a completely different language and culture that literally pushes ALL whites away, liberal or oonservative.</p>
<p>I grew up in a 100% white town in an all-white county back in the 70s and 80s.  Now I don&rsquo;t even know what it&rsquo;s like to live around white people because all my neighbors are asian, latino or who-knows-what!  I am worried about the future of planet earth.  What will happen when the country breaks up, and all those nukes and powerful weapons are floating around?</p>

		<p>To Anonymous #30:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m black myself, living in a predominantly white neighborhood, and I totally agree with your post. I&rsquo;ve often wondered why more whites haven&rsquo;t seen things that way. I&rsquo;ll gladly admit that white neighborhoods tend to be far safer than black ones, and it&rsquo;s rather unfortunate that something so blatant is actually a source of controversy. Some people will deny the fact outright, while others have a ready-made list of excuses.  </p>
<p>I strongly believe that the gradual transition from a mostly safe white neighborhood into an unsafe black war-zone follows the same characteristics in most cases. Rather than consisting of a sudden surge in violent, criminal activity, the change begins with the sudden emergence of behavior which is certainly undesirable, but not actually illegal. This includes youths congregating and traveling in large, noisy groups; the playing of loud, vulgar music; spitting on the streets; the unabashed usage of profane language in public, even in front of small children; the wearing of sloppy, baggy jeans; shouting to others from a distance rather than calling them on cellphones, or approaching them to speak discreetly; hanging out late at night where this is unusual; etc. These are the types of behaviors which may not break any laws, but are clearly meant to make those of a different temperament feel uncomfortable, and to thumb one&rsquo;s nose at the unspoken rules established by the good people who&rsquo;ve long lived in that community. When the latter call the authorities to report this, or similar, behavior, those who engage in it take joy in knowing that they&rsquo;re not breaking any laws, making the authorities nearly powerless to stop them. Their attitude is, &#8220;Hey, I&rsquo;m not breaking the law, so back off&#8221;. This behavior gradually changes the very look and feel of the community, and is a gateway into even more egregious misbehavior, which these ghetto-minded youths must constantly escalate just to maintain the shock value to their decent neighbors. Any request to tone down voices, leave the park, turn off the radio, etc., are met with accusations of nitpicking, and harassing young minorities who aren&rsquo;t harming anyone. Their insistence upon doing these things are only an alert to the whites in the area that a deleterious new culture and mindset are slowly, quietly seeping into their midst, prompting them to leave before things invariably worsen. In short, such newcomers cannot help maintain the type of community they now live in, because they are deliberately, constantly undermining the very values which resulted in its creation. I don&rsquo;t believe that this stupidity is common amongst the blacks who moved there long before them. Even they would likely search, eventually, for greener pastures, seeing that the very ghetto chaos and dysfunction they once escaped have finally caught up to them. </p>

		<p>Section 8 housing is to blame. It drives up both rent and housing prices. In San diego, rent for a basic house is 2500 a month. This is because the government gives soldiers there 2000 a month housing allowance. Blacks get 2000 a month section 8 allowance. If you are white, educated, hard working, you end up living in a 1500 a month slum hole. Eventually the whites who are NOT rich move away leaving only the very wealthy land owners and the very poor. There are so many poor that garbage cans have to have locks on them. Is this the model we want for America? </p>

		<p>Being attracted to people like ourselves is transcends race. We also tend to associate people our own age, our own economic strata, who share our political and religious views, etc. </p>
<p>For example, many communities have &#8216;invisible lines&rsquo; that distinguish Catholic and Protestant households.  </p>
<p>One has to wonder why social engineers focus on race; making it the only taboo. </p>

		<p>By now it is a commonplace that cheerleaders for &#8220;desegregation&#8221; almost never reside within precincts transformed by their handiwork. America&rsquo;s post-WWII ruling class has made it nearly impossible for the white urban wage-earner to live in a safe &amp; peaceful neighborhood, free from loud criminals. And nota bene: academic historians routinely ascribe sea-changes in British, Chinese, &amp; East Indian governance to changing ethnicities of those at the top; yet in re North America&hellip;. curious silence!  </p>

		<p>I worked with a black guy a few years ago. He told me he was moving away from an area that was almost all black. He was moving to a &#8221; mixed&#8221; area. He told me the all black area had too many thugs and was not safe. The problem is the mixed area will become more and more black, and it will become unsafe too. </p>

		<p><b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a glass-half-full-half-empty story,&rdquo; said the Urban Institute&rsquo;s Margery Turner, an expert on housing patterns. &ldquo;Predominantly white neighborhoods are no longer as homogeneous as in the past. They&rsquo;ve opened up tremendously.</b></p>
<p>Um, our countries and neighborhoods were not &#8216;opened up&rsquo; by us voluntarily. They were opened up against our will.</p>
<p><b> And yet, white people are, in general, not moving into neighborhoods that are predominantly black. Majority black neighborhoods are remaining majority black, or becoming more majority black, at the same time white neighborhoods are opening up.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p>Gee, I can&rsquo;t imagine why whites or even other minorities don&rsquo;t want to be around blacks.  Only whites that don&rsquo;t want to be around blacks are &#8216;hateful nazi K members&rsquo;, right? Certainly would have nothing to do with the crime rate, the gangs, their white kids getting attacked because they&rsquo;re white, corruption, loud music, unruly behavior, bad schools, welfare dependents, oversexed males and all the other wonderful attributes of the black communities.</p>

		<p>As a white stay-behind in a now all black Chicago neighborhood, I know this story inside out.  The memories of the good days, the coming of the first blacks, the rising tensions, the whites leaving slowly at first, then the descent into riots, followed by mass flight.  That was the &rsquo;60s, and things only got worse over the decades, with the influx of Asians, Arabs and Mexicans.  </p>
<p>One point among many I could make regards the comment of #49:  &#8220;It can happen the other way around, that is whites moving in and taking over a black neighborhood,often called gentrification. Look at Bostons South End or parts of DC.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is more to this gentrification story than meets the eye.  For these new people, invariably members of the new financial and information based economy which supplanted the industrial one, are completing the cycle begun by their parents and grandparents, the liberals who engineered the replacement of the previous white residents, by the blacks who are now in turn being displaced by whites again.  So for those of us who refused to be driven out in the first onslaught, it is a bittersweet moment in time, as we watch the descendents of those who drove our neighbors out being driven out by the descendents of those who enabled their grandparents&rsquo; onslaught.  It is truly a stunning victory of liberal elites; they achieved their policy aims in the &rsquo;50s and &rsquo;60s with desegregation, feminism, sexual and political revolution, and now their progeny are reaping the reward of revitalized urban neighborhoods swept clean both of blacks, and of their parent&rsquo;s nemesis, the two parent, church-going, native born white working class family.            </p>
