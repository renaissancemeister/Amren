<h1>Cain: Racism Doesn&rsquo;t Hold Blacks Back</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gautham Nagesh, The Hill, October 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain argued that racism is not a professional barrier for African-Americans on CNN&rsquo;s State of the Union on Sunday.</p>
<p>His answer came in response to a question in which host Candy Crowley suggested that Cain, who grew up poor and black, had been the benefit of some luck and was superimposing his success on his entire race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck is where preparation meets opportunity,&#8221; Cain responded. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t believe racism in this country holds anybody back in a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cain acknowledged that there are still elements of racism in American society but argued the best way to help blacks is to enact policies that raise the entire economy, an argument often used by President Obama. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;People sometimes hold themselves back because they want to use racism as an excuse for them not being able to achieve what they want to achieve,&#8221; Cain said.</p>
<p>When asked why African-Americans have been hit especially hard from the recession, Cain pointed to a deficit in education levels and the concentration of blacks in cities like Detroit that have been ravaged by the recession. {snip}</p>

		<p>Uh duh. I happen to be black. No troll here. I found this site quite a while back and finally, finally I have decided to write in. I know I not alone in saying this: the black race hustlers DO NOT SPEAK FOR ME!  There I got that off my chest I grew up around low class blacks, the hate whitey, hate republicans type, but I advanced myself in life. Today, I have Absolutely no use for Any blacks, sadly that includes my own family. This is not all that painful to mention as it is something that I needed to get off my chest. Again, there are other blacks in America who support the genius of whites. If blacks had come here all alone would we have electricity, Internet, cell phones, cameras, camcorders, etc.? No way<br>
So let me say as a registered independent who Did Not Vote for Obama, I love living under White rule. I don&rsquo;t want this country to be South Africa by 2024 or so. Thank you all for reading. Sighhhhhhh&hellip;.</p>

		<p> I think we should just go ahead and try an experiment. Lets do away with affirmative action and set asides and regardless of the squealing stick with equality. The African Americans and others will raise their game or prove they aren&rsquo;t competent and then we use common sense to provide jobs for all based solely on individual ability.<br>
 We need to get away from all discrimination.</p>

		<p>Sorry, still not voting for the pizza jockey.  Ever.</p>
<p>I want to go back to about two weeks ago and something he said after winning the Florida (meaningless) straw poll, that the reason blacks have voted almost 100% Democrat in almost every national election in our lifetimes was because they&rsquo;re &#8220;brainwashed.&#8221;  My sarcastic reaction at the time was that the Democrat Party must have a brainwashing machine that would be the envy of Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot combined, so maybe the Communists and Nazis should have liberated us from our Democrats before we liberated them;  my honest reaction after leaving sarcasm mode was that the reason blacks vote Democrat is because the Democrat Party serves their interests better, because the Democrats will always promise and deliver more tangible and intangible government benefits than the Republican ever can, (as hard as they try).  A few days later, a prominent Democrat (think it was Debbie Waserman Schultz) had a reaction similar to mine, but it was the yin to my yang, that to say that blacks have been &#8220;brainwashed&#8221; since 1932 is to say that blacks are stupid and gullible, which is an insult to black voters.  Now, I&rsquo;m hardly bull-ish on black intelligence, but they&rsquo;re not that dumb.</p>
<p>The pizza jockey really needs to start thinking things through before he says them.</p>

		<p>Herman Cain is the most refreshingly honest and straightforward man in the race.  He&rsquo;s also been a huge success outside of politics, a realm in which success is rarely something to be proud of.</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s still around for the election he&rsquo;ll get my vote.  Romney&rsquo;s simply a dispiriting re-run of George Herbert Bush, Obama&rsquo;s a proven disaster, and anybody the Dems get to replace him will be worse still.</p>

<p>Gimme a break!!  Detroit hasn&rsquo;t been even close to First World functionality since the early 1970&rsquo;s, good economic times or bad economic times or whatever notwithstanding. The fact that this has been (until relatively recently) a dirty little secret known to a very small percentage of the US population is really the most remarkable aspect of Detroit history. The &#8220;Edukashun deficit&#8221; is an equally absurd canard. Education is a two way street in the real world  &mdash;  Instructor offers knowledge and student groks or fails to grok same. The Ghetto is full of one way skreets.</p>

<p>Another lie. Come on, Cain you know better than that!</p>
<p> How have they (blacks) been hit hard?</p>
<p><br>
Most government and AA &#8220;workers&#8221; are black and I don&rsquo;t see them losing any jobs. The rest NEVER worked during good times or bad times! So what is the deal here? You trying to pull the wool over White America&rsquo;s eyes again?</p>
<p> As for concentration of blacks in cities that have been &#8220;ravaged&#8221; by the recession is just another excuse. EVERYWHERE that has a concentration of blacks turns into a ghetto overnight. Could the answer be BECAUSE they are black that most still cannot make it even with all the help of AA and quotas?  It is Whites that are hit the hardest, not blacks.</p>

		<p>If Herman Cain says that he will repeal the 1964 Civil Rights Act and dismantle every pro-Black government program, I&rsquo;ll take a chance and vote for him.<br>

Otherwise he is no better than McCain or any other Republican, with the exception of Ron Paul.<br>

		<p>He&rsquo;s right of course.  When blacks start harping about racism they don&rsquo;t provide modern examples.  Instead they dredge up stories from decades or even centuries ago.  While I have doubts about Cain&rsquo;s viability, I also know it doesn&rsquo;t matter if he is elected.  Blacks in America will simply write him off as an Uncle Tom because the very worst racists in America are black.  They hate anyone who isn&rsquo;t black or doesn&rsquo;t hate whites.  In the modern age blacks are their own worst enemy doing far more damage to themselves than any of the organized white efforts of the 20th century.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t really care what Cain says. He is just another neo con. He was with the Federal reserve. And the fact that he is black makes me wonder how much of his standing is from affirmative action anyway. Cain also supported the bailouts. He has flipped flopped and is not trust worthy.</p>
<p>This putting our black against your black routine is getting old. It is a tactic used to prove that republicans are not racist. After all, the neo cons worship MLK. So we put our neo con black against your marxist black and that proves that we are not racist. But they do not understand that you are ALWAYS  gonna be seen as racist. </p>
<p><br>
The only real choice is Ron Paul. He is the only true constitutional candidate. The rest are Bush clones, War hungry neo cons. They couldn&rsquo;t care less about the constitution. Most of them probably haven&rsquo;t even read it. And you certainly don&rsquo;t need another fast talking black in the white house. </p>

		<p>I thought Cain was done for after he put his foot in it with Rick Perry&rsquo;s ranch. But apparently he&rsquo;s surging in the polls. His rhetoric is a smart strategy   &mdash;   telling a largely white audience what they (and most blacks) already know to be true. But is he the real deal or just for show? I&rsquo;d like to say yes. Then, again, I&rsquo;m reminded of that other news article from today: Brain Imaging Reveals Why We Remain Optimistic in the Face of Reality.</p>

		<p>I am also a black person who enjoys reading stuff on Amren on a daily basis.  I find myself nodding in agreement to almost everything I read here.  This is one of the only places to find an honest and intelligent discussion about race relations (Elizabeth Wright got it right too).  Growing up in an environment that constantly berates the white race, this is a like a breath of fresh air.  I love Europeans and European cultures so much and have a sincere appreciation for their contributions to humankind.  Truth be told, I believe the white man is God&rsquo;s gift to the earth. There, I had to get this off my chest too - thanks.    </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be a fool. The reason he can be so &#8220;refreshing and honest&#8221; is because he is BLACK! A White man will NEVER be allowed to be &#8220;honest&#8221; about race! Forget the Dems or the Repubs! They are all alike. Promises, promises. Go 3rd Party and at least vote for someone who is more pro-White than pro-diversity! The media is now pushing Cain and that should give you a clue as to why. </p>

		<p>The only reason Herman Cain is even being discussed here is that the Tea Partyers have knelt before him in another example of &#8220;See I am not a racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Herman Cain may have experienced moderate success with Godfathers Pizza, but I doubt it was anything to write home about. Go to the Godfathers Pizza website. It&rsquo;s a f&rsquo;ing POS, early 90s html that could have been done by some AA graduate of Devry. Ask him to show the numbers for Godfathers. I don&rsquo;t believe they are going to reveal anything striking.</p>
<p>Everything about Herman Cain screeam AA candidate. Starting with his promotion by Pillsbury in the late 80s. Herman Cain has thown his hat in the ring in the race for POTUS, he is a politician.  Don&rsquo;t believe anything a politician says with out proof.</p>

<p>You raise a valid point that people are criticizing black conservatives whereas they didn&rsquo;t criticize jindal, hayley or hispanic conservatives. However, don&rsquo;t forget that 98% of blacks voted for a president who hangs out with the Nation of Islam and New Black Panther Party. And that includes plenty of &#8220;black conservatives&#8221; like Colin Powell &amp; JC Watts who crossed the aisle to vote for him. So if people are reluctant to trust Cain now then blame those &#8220;black conservatives&#8221; who voted for a black supremacist during the last election. Now, there are a handful I would trust. But the jury is still out on Cain. I just don&rsquo;t know him well enough yet.</p>

		<p>Frankly, Cain strikes me as just another result of the white population&rsquo;s great quest for a black leader they can look upon with favor. That quest is evident in politics and in every other area of life. </p>
<p>The truth about Obama is that he&rsquo;s been elevated to the very top because he&rsquo;s (half) black. We cannot remedy the damage he&rsquo;s damage by elevating Herman Cain. </p>

		<p>Keep in mind the complexity both of white and black differences, and of their relationships since the 1960s. <br>
Teaching in English state schools over 30 years, the ablest pupil I encountered was a black girl of Nigerian origin, with ladylike manners, quick intelligence, and the ability rapidly to write faultless essays in beautiful handwriting; she later went on to study physics at Cambridge. Yet I am well aware she was an extreme rarity, and I agree with the general assessment of black peoples&rsquo; average IQ by Lynn &c.; Gayre thought African females were brighter than black males.<br>
  <br>
We have good reason to produce white children and to protect &#8220;white&#8221; cvilization, whether others like it or not.<br>
Our main enemies are white liberals and non-white racialists who who work against this legitimate objective.</p>
<p>We should have no quarrel with intelligent blacks prepared to support our objective, or to make their own positive contributions however limited to civilization (not including jumping about to gangsta rap &c;).  Nor should we quarrel with blacks seek maintaining their own racial identity and opposing cross-breeding, so long as they do not attack white society (like Black Muslims &c;).</p>
<p>We should oppose all criminals, vice and narcotics dealers, feckless breeders, and welfare scroungers, whatever their race.</p>
<p>A major difficulty ahead is that too many whites are no more amenable to reason or forward-planning than blacks.  The poisonous &#8220;sex, drugs and rock&rsquo;n-roll&#8221; hedonism introduced into western society has produed irrational addictions which undermine family values and national cohesion, undermining resistance to miscegenation and shallow values. The apotheosis of the black or mixed-race &#8220;sex-queen&#8221; in popular entertainment and &#8220;clubbing&#8221;, and the degradation of white youth culture by what decent blacks have called &#8220;devil music&#8221;, are obstacles to rational progress.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going out on a limb and guessing that another reason you read AR&rsquo;s news stories and comment section regularly is that you&rsquo;re tired of certain kinds of deceitful white people (namely, the left-right Republocrats) lying to you.  While I&rsquo;m not bull-ish on black intelligence, I do think almost everyone can spot a phony from a mile away.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Cain, Rush said today that he hardly has any money in his war chest, and insinuated that Cain is basically a bird dog for Romney, the quid pro quo being cabinet position or running mate.  (Too, I think Michele Bachmann has become the same thing, and I think what&rsquo;s in it for her is that a President Romney would twist Boehner&rsquo;s arm to resign as Speaker to clear the way for her becoming House Speaker.)  Cain&rsquo;s top tier status I think is only temporary.</p>

		<p>I would NEVER vote for him.He is George Bush in Blackface.He wants 9-9-9:(9% income tax,9% corporate tax, and 9% sales tax on EVERYTHING.That would really benefit the ultra wealthy (again)and raise taxes for all of the working poor (and put the deficit in the 2+ trillion dollar range). </p>

		<p>I cannot believe so many, even a few here sadly, are falling for this nonsense! My God, mouth a few standard paint-by-numbers &#8220;conservative&#8221; phrases and say what everyone already knows, and I swear many Whites would follow anyone straight into Hell! </p>
<p>If you wish to be lead by Blacks, so long as they are &#8220;conservative&#8221;(see Neocon), you may need to reassess just why you read AR and are on this board.  </p>

		<p>It really IS possible for a black conservative to be the best out of the Republican candidates, simply because he wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of being called racist on certain issues like immigration. But I haven&rsquo;t seen enough proof yet that Cain is the best candidate.  </p>
<p>So far I am getting the impression that he is only getting exalted because of his race (no surprise there).  </p>
<p>I am noticing more and more that white followers of the Republican Party are always quick to compliment the nonwhite candidate (whether Indian, black,hispanic, etc&hellip;) simply because they are &#8220;good enough&#8221;, and it makes them feel good inside to see, for instance, a black man for once saying conservative things.  But does that qualify him as the best candidate?  Usually the case is that if the candidate were white they would get little attention, or better yet, they would get laughed at based on their miniscule qualifications.  </p>
<p>Bobby Jindal is a perfect example (I don&rsquo;t agree with the poster above who said we are only critical of blacks).  It didn&rsquo;t take long after Obama got elected for Republicans to make a big deal about Jindal. Then the world saw him get up and speak in response to Obama and all I can say is that if he were white he would have appeared very clown like and goofy.  </p>
<p>This is what I mean&hellip;&hellip;  </p>
<p>Republicans lower their standards for minority candidates only because they are minorities who think conservatively.  They like to &#8220;ooh&#8221; and &#8220;aahh&#8221; over them the same way they would a kitten.  Meanwhile the white Republican candidates are held to higher standards. </p>
<p>I dated a guy one time (from the West Coast; not Alabama), who would constantly go out of his way to tell me about how such and such black candidate was his favorite.  I would ask him why he liked that candidate so much.  In response he would quickly say &#8220;race doesn&rsquo;t matter to me&#8221;&hellip;.which never explained to me why this black guy was more qualified than some of the white candidates.</p>
<p>Likewise, it seems to me that right now, every white Republican voter I speak to in person, and every conservative Talk Radio host is praising Cain as the best candidate.  Little explanation is ever given as to why they like him so much. He is clearly not the most qualified. </p>
<p>I am sick of this country&rsquo;s obsession with race over qualifications. I am voting Third Party this next election if Cain is the one that gets picked, unless I get convinced that he is somehow going to save white America better than anyone else will.</p>

		<p>Just finished watching the debate tonight.  Some of the candidates brought up a problem with Cain&rsquo;s precious 9-9-9 tax plan:  It would, for the first time, institute a Federal sales tax, thereby giving the Federal government another tax collection vector.  Too, if you think the numbers stay at 9% forever, you&rsquo;re only kidding yourself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a moot point anyway, 9-9-9 would never pass Congress because the lobbyists for tax lawyers and accountants would kill it.  The cost of complying with complicated tax laws is high, but someone is in turn making that money.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like 9-9-9, and think it would be beneficial overall, except I disagree with Cain that there should be no capital gains tax.  Even if 9-9-9 passes, I would still want a capital gains tax, and per Ross Perot&rsquo;s idea, a reverse stair-stepped one, which would mean the longer you hold an asset, the lower the CGT rate is.  That means that the CGs of quick stock flips are taxed at high rates, and long-held real estate CGs are taxed at very low rates.  The reason to tax the CGs of quick buy-cell cycle assets is to deter quick asset flips, in turn to prevent the deleterious social consequences of quick asset flips.  When Perot proposed the stair stepped CGT in 1992, the main problem then was that to pump up their companies&rsquo; stock values in the short term, corporate management outsourced jobs to China and Bangalore.  That&rsquo;s still a problem now, but a further problem was rapid house flipping during the <i>voulez-vous les bon temps roulet</i> of the subprime mortgage mania. </p>

		<p>I can hardly believe my eyes and ears, when I read and hear WHITE morons on supposedly pro-White websites like AR, or on other news websites and forums which are inhabited by whites who show every sign of being at least &#8216;implicitly&rsquo; pro-white - posting or making comments about how &#8216;in love&rsquo; they are with this Herman Cain stooge.</p>
<p>Has the White European race not learned A SINGLE LESSON from being ruled over by a racial enemy who hates their guts for the last 3 plus years? </p>
<p>Come ON, White Men and White Women!  Engage your Brains! Did Obama run across the country, speaking to White audiences and confessing how much he hated them and how he intended to pick their pockets (Obamacare) and how he intended to base literally every decision he would make as President on how he could advantage blacks over whites, on how he would work to turn whites into a minority inside their own nation by granting amnesty to 30-40 million illegal aliens, most of whom are from Mexico?  Did Obama say ANYTHING truthful when he was in the process of snookering whitey to vote for him and to disregard that voice in their heads which was whispering to them that its NEVER a wise idea to vote to put a race other than your own in power over you and your country?  Did Obama inform White Americans that once he was elected, he would conspire to sell dangerous weapons to murderous, blood-thirsty drug cartels in Mexico in a devious and clearly criminal and impeachable attempt to manufacture a link between US gun stores and US gun dealers and the drug cartels and then use that as a pretext to enact gun bans and enact new gun control laws which are designed to deprive mostly White Americans of their precious and sacred Second Amendment rights? Can anyone name even ONE thing that Obama has done that helped White people?     The answers to ALL of the previous questions are emphatically &#8216;No&rsquo;.   What Obama did do is to make speeches to White audiences and tell them what his string pullers (Goldman Sachs) told him they wanted to hear.  Exactly the same template now being used by Herman Cain, the full blooded black man - who is also &#8216;owned&rsquo; by Goldman Sachs and the criminals on Wall Street.   </p>
<p>American Renaissance readers are supposedly Whites who are &#8220;awake&#8221; and who are recapturing their racial pride and sense of racial preservation - but, even these Whites seem to be unable to shake off the decades of anti-white enemy controlled media propaganda that motivate so many White idiots to fall to their knees and lust to lick the toes of minorities.   </p>
<p>What is it about White people that makes so many of them crave to vote for a non-white and to help install one of their racial competitors into power over them and their nation?  Are whites racially suicidal?   </p>
<p>Are Whites still not aware of the fact that the first half-black President in our nation&rsquo;s history has plotted, along with his black Attorney General,  to plant dangerous weapons into the hands of Mexican drug cartel murder squads in hopes that those weapons would be used to kill US Border Patrol and DEA/FBI agents and then he and Holder could trace those weapons back to the USA gun dealers who sold them to undercover straw purchasers and then Obama could use this to justify enacting more draconian gun control laws on law abiding White American gun owners?   This is a clear warning of what minority rule over Whites will bring, people.  This is a criminal, clearly Treasonous Act, people.  Wake up, White Man.   The FIRST non-white we entrust with our White House in our nation&rsquo;s history enters into a conspiracy FROM THE OVAL OFFICE - to deliberately attempt to subvert the law in order to undermine the U.S. Constitution and the Second Amendment and to manufacture false &#8216;evidence&rsquo; that he intended to use to deprive White American citizens of our Second Amendment rights - and we&rsquo;ve learned nothing from this experience?   We&rsquo;re considering voting for Herman Cain, another non-white, and trusting him with the White House?</p>
<p>Oh, and it&rsquo;s not just half blacks like Obama who show disdain for those European derived laws and rights.  Remember Alberto Gonzales and John Loo in the Bush Administration?    Those two non-Whites were heavily involved in issuing &#8216;advice&rsquo; to Bush that third world caliber, disgusting practices such as &#8216;torture&rsquo; were A-OK - in direct violation of both International Law, Constitutional law, and the Geneva Convention mandates!  </p>
<p>Ask yourself this question - if Cain is somehow elected, and decides to amnesty 30-40 million illegal criminal aliens, and then decides that we need to show our &#8220;compassion&#8221; and open up the floodgates from Haiti and Africa and import millions of his fellow blacks into America - every one of whom will immediately hop onto the public dole and who will be resettled in every community across America that the nosy Census statistics questions about race tell our anti-white government is &#8216;too white&rsquo; and which therefore needs to be polluted with third world, predatory,  violent and criminally prone &#8216;non-white refugees&rsquo; - is a scenario like this going to be what it finally takes to knock some freaking common racial sense into the empty skulls of suicidal White people?     </p>
<p>For whites who would vote for Cain - would you mind telling me how you would be able to later oppose any effort on his part to bring in MORE of his people from Africa or Haiti?  </p>
<p>Concentrate, White man.   The goal is a White Ethnostate.   Exclusively White ethnostate, lead by White men who are racially healthy, and pro-white.   The goal is NOT to subjugate your race to being permanently ruled over by your racial competitors - especially not racial competitors who have deep-rooted, deep-seated resentments and feelings of hostility towards your race for real or perceived transgressions committed in the past by your white racial ancestors.  </p>
<p>More and more, I am convinced that the vast majority of the White race has a suicidal death wish.   What is so DIFFICULT about placing the perfectly legitimate ethnic specific interests of Whites at the top of your list, people?   </p>

<p>I agree with every word you said. I am also voting 3rd party. Cain will NEVER save White America. No black will or ever have the desire to do so. Cain doesn&rsquo;t give a whit about the White race, he only spouts what is popular with the so-called conservatives to get their praise and their votes.   None of the Whites running, will either. They are all beholden to the &#8220;movers and shakers&#8221;&hellip;. Maybe, Paul will but I doubt it. He also praises MLK which is a travesty in itself. The Third Party is our only choice left. </p>

		<p>I suppose I haven&rsquo;t made myself clear.</p>
<p>The United States of America is a white country, in that its majority population is white and its dominant culture stems from the white population.  Therefore, the President of the United States should always be white.  I don&rsquo;t want a non-white President, ever.  Not Barack Obama, not Herman Cain, not Ezola Foster, not Colin Powell, not Allen West, not Elizabeth Wright (RIP), not Carol Swain, not Piyush (&#8220;Bobby&#8221;) Jindal, not Nimrata Randhawa (&#8220;Nikki Haley&#8221;).  </p>
<p>Argue with me if you must, but if you&rsquo;re going to do that, then you&rsquo;re also going to say that the United States of America shouldn&rsquo;t have a dominant racial or ethnic population.  I imagine the retort will be, &#8220;Nation of Ideas,&#8221; but as Sam Francis so deftly pointed out long ago, the credal propositionists lay the foundation for a brutal ideological-based regime. </p>

<p>And then if you&rsquo;re going to say that the United States isn&rsquo;t a racial or ethnic nation, nor a &#8220;nation of ideas,&#8221; then what is it, precisely?  Merely a geographical accident, or a province of the fiction known as the global economy?  Sorry, I don&rsquo;t want to live in that world, either.</p>
<p>Luke:  Like I&rsquo;ve been saying re F&F;, it&rsquo;s obvious Obama used it to sandbag 2nd Am. politics. I want to know if he also thought it a way to sandbag the immigration debate.</p>

		<p>Any white who votes for a black candidate after Obama is either suicidal or self-hating. After seeing the black flash mobs the black racial attacks in Wisconsin Philly Chicago etc the black rioting and looting caused by their idea that they are in control now and they can do what they want.

<p>I have asked myself that question so many times and have come to the same conclusion much like your own. I once said there had to be something targeted at Whites only (besides indoctrination) that made so many oblivious to the fact of their own racial genocide (suicide). I came to the conclusion that maybe through vaccines, water poisoning, etc. that ONLY affected the White race specifically (race targeted) was implemented in one form or another and some of us (through our own genetic makeup, immune system etc) were able to reject that poison somehow. What else could it be that some of us did not &#8220;drink the Kool aid&#8221; while most did?  </p>

		<p>Asked how [his 999 plan] would apply to a computer designed domestically but containing Malaysian components and assembled in China, he replied, &ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo; <br>
     <br>
Even the Cain campaign&rsquo;s own economist said the 999 plan &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be the one I picked&rdquo; to run with. Remember, the plan was crafted by a Koch-affiliated financial adviser from a Wells Fargo branch in Ohio, not an actual economist. <br>
    <br>
As ABC reported today, a long list of economists &ldquo;say Cain&rsquo;s plan would be a tax hike for the lower middle class and a tax windfall for the wealthy.&rdquo; Conservative economist Bruce Bartlett wrote that, &ldquo;at a minimum, the Cain plan is a distributional monstrosity.&rdquo; Cain would surely dispute these assertions, but how seriously can his protests be taken if he freely admits he has &ldquo;no idea&rdquo; how the plan would even function?<br>

		<p>Herman Cain is just this year&rsquo;s GOP candidate putting on a minstrel show for the enjoyment of whites (who unfortunately can&rsquo;t distinguish a minstrel showman from a serious politician).  Alan Keyes was that candidate the last 4 times out.</p>
<p>Notice that Mr. Obama doesn&rsquo;t &#8216;shuck and jive&rsquo;, chortle and make ridiculous far-fetched statemented like Cain (&#8216;999&rsquo;, indeed).  That is because Obama was/is a serious candidate (and maybe have a little something to do with the fact he is half white).</p>
<p>p.s. Protestant preaching over the last 25 years has also been influenced by this trend to shuck and jive and chortle in sermons.  I enjoy a good minstrel show as much as the next guy, but it doesn&rsquo;t belong among serious men and serious subjects like God and politics.</p>

		<p>Bobby Jindal are FAR more intelligent than this Cain clown.</p>
<p>IMO, Jindal is making a MAJOR mistake by not running. He is a far more competent &#8216;token&rsquo; minority than Cain. In fact, he&rsquo;s not a token cuz Indians (dot not feather-feather Indians are given affirmative action while dot Indians are not) feather  are held to the same standards as whites. Even the David Duke fans in Louisiana were treated to a pleasant surprise when Jindal took over- he is far more right wing than any mainstream white candidate out there. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m moving back to India next year (summer 2012) so I won&rsquo;t be around when the elections happen but I wish you good luck. In my honest opinion, if a white candidate wins against Obama, there could be widespread rioting so I&rsquo;ll be glad that I&rsquo;m safe in Bangalore.</p>

NEW YORK (CNNMoney)   &mdash;   Under Herman Cain&rsquo;s 9-9-9 tax reform plan, 84% of U.S. households would pay more than they do under current tax policies, according to a report released Tuesday by a nonpartisan research group&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Those are some of the estimates from the Tax Policy Center&rsquo;s analysis of Cain&rsquo;s proposal&hellip;<br>
 <br>
According to the Tax Policy Center, households with incomes below $30,000 would have, on average, between 16% and 20% less in after-tax income than they do today. By contrast, households making more than $200,000 would see their after-tax income grow by between 5% and 22% on average.<br>
