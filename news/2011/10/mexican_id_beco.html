<h1><a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Sonoma-Sheriff-Santa-Rosa-Police-Recognize-Mexican-IDs-132465578.html">Mexican ID Becomes Valid ID in Sonoma County</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Roberts, NBC Bay Area, October 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In Sonoma County, a California driver&rsquo;s license is accepted as valid identification  &mdash;  but so is a card issued by the Mexican consulate.</p>
<p>Mexican nationals will be able to give their country&rsquo;s state-issued identification cards as valid ID to Santa Rosa police officers and Sonoma County sheriffs, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported.</p>
<p>The idea is to reduce the immigration-related duties of local cops, the newspaper reported. Accepting Mexican consulate-issued cards will reduce the number of people booked into jail for lacking ID, and ergo, will reduce deportations from Santa Rosa County Jail, the newspaper reported.</p>

		<p>Great!  And how do I, a US citizen. get one of the &#8220;get out of jail free&#8221; cards?  US citizens have to have license, registration and insurance.  Illegals none of the above?  And I am sure the control and validity of those Mexican IDs are a rigorous as we have here to get a license.  You know 3 kinds of ID to get a driver&rsquo;s license that will stand muster with the TSA.  <br>
We have stooped to being that of a third world country with their practices.  Worse yet we have them issue their IDs for their citizens in our country.  And law enforcement, when they see these Mexican IDs (which are only used by illegals) give them a free pass.  Madness.  </p>

		<p>But how could it reduce deportations? The Mexican ID only confirms (perhaps) the identity of the bearer. It doesn&rsquo;t show the legal status of the card holder. Most holders of those consulate issued identification cards are in this country illegally since that shows they can&rsquo;t get valid US documents. </p>

		<p>Okay. This should get the last ten people in Mexico here. Now do we start on Central and South America, then hop to the islands? This government can&rsquo;t wait for our country to become the next third world. We&rsquo;ve got a great start.</p>

		<p>The use of a matricular counselor card should constitute probable cause for an officer to investigate further into the immigration status of the person presenting the card. In a sane world, that would be the case!</p>
<p>In any event, any word yet on how long this country will continue to tolerate Mexico&rsquo;s open defiance of our immigration laws, not to mention natural sovereignty.<br>

		<p>Sound&rsquo;s like a good answer would be to get rid of those consulates altogether.</p>
<p>The Mexican government is at war with us, people. Each consulate is a headquarters. They have no legitimate diplomatic purpose: they exist to serve their horde.   </p>

<p>Oh so true!</p>
<p>AND,  &#8220;our&#8221; governor just made it a whole lot easier for unlicensed illegal colonists to drive on our already dangerous roads!</p>
<p><i>Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that will decrease public safety to please his illegal alien base. Specifically the new law will disallow the confiscation of vehicles at traffic checkpoints belonging to unlicensed drivers, who are mostly illegals.</i></p>
<p><i>Unlicensed drivers, even sober ones, are far more dangerous than persons who are licensed. Unlicensed drivers are involved in one in five fatal crashes.</i></p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t need my driver&rsquo;s license (unlike ILLEGALS) so often for ID, I wouldn&rsquo;t bother renewing it.  What&rsquo;s the point of having one and why am I even required to have one to drive on California&rsquo;s highways if THEY aren&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>We are doomed.  California is a lost cause.</p>

<p>Yeah, no kidding.</p>
<p>Did you hear the latest??</p>
<p>El Presidente Calderon is complaining that mexican deportees from the US are causing crime rates to increase in mexico. </p>
<p><i>Mexico&rsquo;s Presidente Calderon has complained that Mexican citizens given a free trip home (courtesy of the American taxpayer) are committing crimes upon their return.</i></p>
<p><i>President Felipe Calderon accused U.S. authorities of deporting Mexican criminals to save on judicial costs, a policy that ostensibly &#8216;exacerbates&rsquo; violence in this country.</i></p>
<p>They&rsquo;re YOUR people, Calderon, YOU deal with it.  It is NOT incumbent upon the American to take in YOUR dependent destitute and criminal population.</p>
<p>Build the damn wall already.</p>

		<p>This is where Nancy and Paul Pelosi have their vineyards, resorts, restaurants and other businesses that make her one of the richest members of congress.</p>
<p>Paul came from a wealthy family and is a good businessman.  But when the illegals started pouring in the Pelosi&rsquo;s changed directions, moved  their operations to Sonoma and went for cheap labor businesses. it was the change to illegal, rather than American workers that made the Pelosis extremely instead of moderately rich.</p>
<p>The minority leader will not have to be embarassed by  allegations of hiring illegals any more.  The illegals in Sonama<br>
and the other agricultural counties in California have turned them into crime ridden slums except for the mansions surrounded by acres of manicured grounds where the employers of the illegals reside.</p>
<p>No longer can big city Californians retire or move to the agricultural and northern forest mountain counties in search of low crime and clean cities.</p>
<p>Now the entire state is 4th world Mexico.</p>

		<p>I left Sonoma County ten years ago for reasons directly related to this story.  Commentors are correct about the Left bias there.  But it is not complete.  Many of the Leftists have taken hits due to the overwhelming of communities and the arrival of gangs, myself included.  I finally had enough and moved north. But I see Oregon and Washington going in the same direction, because of their politics.  Too many whites are concerned with being &#8220;tolerant&#8221; and PC, even conservatives, in a funny sort of way (the way Republicans are floating Herman Cain right now).</p>
<p>I just spoke with an old friend in Sonoma County yesterday.  It is important to understand that Sonoma County is a HUGE wine producing county.  Deportations and voluntary returns to Mexico are claimed to affect the workers available for the present grape harvesting season.  My friend used to pick fruit back in the 50s, when white people did most of the farm work.  So we talked about that issue and I brought up the apple picking labor FRAUD we just saw up here and was reported to Amren by a poster or two (me too) earlier this week.</p>
<p>I remember going to the Sonoma DMV to renew my license back in 1993 or so and watching Hispanic DMV employees condone and even assist illegals taking the written test.  About that time I found that some county agencies telephone recordings were first in Spanish.  I know of scores of individual whites who have been robbed, raped, or beaten up so badly that they are permanently disabled by Mexicans.  Hispanics also engage in a great deal of violence among themselves.  But while operating in my profession there I discovered that there were not only Mexican insurance fraud rings, but Laotian (southeast Asian) fraud rings, as well as several other white collar crime fraud rings operating THEN. </p>
<p>As the recent article on Amren and the linked 2011 FBI Gang Activity report shows, things have become and will grow far worse. We know that there are &#8220;No Go&#8221; zones FOR POLICE in for example, LA and San Bernardino Counties, as well as other places around the nation.  I wonder how long our federal government will allow organized crime to take over U.S. geography before it declares martial law in those regions and sends in troops to clean them up?  I also wonder if this might bring about the expected civil war by setting sympathetic or involved troops in to fight gangs?  I&rsquo;d love to see sine comments from any law people in those regions or anyone who has some ideas to add.</p>

<p>It would be nice wouldn&rsquo;t it? There are legitimate causes of action and then there is the reality of the legal system in which<br>
Whites are the designated losers. No matter what a non White does to a White, the White will lose in our judicial system.</p>
<p>The suit would be dismissed as just another drunk driving or criminal offense, nothing to do with his mexican ID.</p>
<p>Remember the Bolgna family in San Francisco?  The father and 2 sons were murdered by an illegal alien felon who had been deported and returned and was under deportation orders.</p>
<p>The murderer had been released from county jail after serving a short sentence shortly before the murders, I believe just one day.</p>
<p>The widow who lost her entire family sued the city of San Francisco for releasing a felon under deportation order without notifying ICE as county sheriff&rsquo;s and city jailers are bound to do by law.</p>
<p>The city filed a demurrer.  The judge sided with the city and dismissed Mrs. Bologna&rsquo;s law suit as without merit.</p>
<p>So in lunatic liberal far left California, you can&rsquo;t sue if an illegal under deportation order just released from jail murders your entire family.</p>
<p>You can sue your neighbor under quality of life if you think that his red geraniums clash with his ocher painted house and<br>
purple petunias, but you can&rsquo;t sue the city that let an illegal felon under deportation order out of jail without notifying ICE as every jailer in the country is bound by law to do.</p>
<p>One law for the ruling class and its minions such as the murderer and another law for the untouchable lower classes such as the Bologna family and the rest of the White Americans. </p>
<p>Similiar case in Los Angeles around the same time.  A high school senior was walking home early one evening.  An illegal alien felon under deportation orders was released from the city jail without ICE notification. The boy was murdered, just gunned down from the car. Less than a day after release. The family filed lawsuits, they were dismissed.</p>
<p>If your dog  dug under your fence and ran out and bit someone, that person would have a cause of action.  Deliberately letting an illegal felon under deportation order out of jail without notifying ICE as the law requires is no longer considered a cause of action.</p>
<p>That is judge made law for you.  Judicial dictatorship.<br>

		<p>Sonoma is mostly white, suburban, and very expensive. Why do these white liberals take so much joy in their own genocide? I wish a white liberal could write in and explain this phenomena. I&rsquo;m sure the explanation would omit any facts or common sense&hellip;it would be mostly them screaming insults at as.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sonoma is mostly white, suburban, and very expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sonoma is all that.  It&rsquo;s economy is agriculture, restaurants, tourism, vacation and retirement homes.</p>
<p>The vacation homes in Rutherford run from 3 to 9 million dollars.  The retirement homes are more expensive than the ones in Beverly Hills.  Many of the restaurant tabs run $400.00 for 2 people.  The French Laundry restaurant has a 5 year waiting list for reservations.</p>
<p>All this opulence requires a servant class.  50 years ago the servants except for the seasonal grape pickers who went back to Mexico were local Whites.</p>
<p>Now the servant class are illegal Mexican Indians.</p>
<p>The biggest city and county seat is 29 percent Hispanic, virtually all low skill restaurant, agricultural, gardening, cleaning workers.</p>
<p>When those jobs were done by Whites 40 years ago, Santa Rosa was safe.  Now that 29 percent Hispanic population has raised the crime rate.  The Santa Rosa schools are full of low achieving Hispanic thugs. <br>

<p>There are mini mexican consulates in the commuter train stations in California.  They are all over the country, especially in areas where there are meat packing plants, farms and tourist industries because the employers will not hire Americans.<br>

<p>First of all my heart goes out to you. When I read a story like your my blood pressure literally goes up. Most of because what happened to this country to allow such a thing to happen to you was no accident. It was planned by a vicious and traitorous Plutocratic class who could care less about human tragedies like your own. I truly hope you are around to see those race traitors to get everything that is coming to them.<br>
Again I am truly sorry that my and your country did this to you.<br>
