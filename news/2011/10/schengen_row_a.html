			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Mason, Public Service Europe, October 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The rejection of Bulgaria and Romania&rsquo;s bid to join the passport-free Schengen travel zone is a &#8220;sign of things to come&#8221; in Europe because xenophobic and far right parties increasingly &#8220;call the shots&#8221;  &mdash;  according to one member of the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Opposition from Finland and the Netherlands to the two south-eastern European countries&rsquo; entry to Schengen is &#8220;completely, purely and unambiguously about internal politics,&#8221; says Claude Moraes, speaking toPublicServiceEurope.com in the week after the application was thwarted.</p>
<p>The British politician, a Labour MEP who speaks on home affairs and justice for the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, insists that both Bulgaria and Romania should be allowed into the 25-member club because &#8220;the assessment based on actual evidence is that they are ready to join&#8221;.</p>
<p>Twenty-two European Union nations, plus Norway, Switzerland and Iceland, are part of the Schengen area  &mdash;  named after the town in Luxembourg where the original treaty was signed in 1985. The bloc operates without internal border controls but works to strengthen the external boundary. Bulgaria and Romania have been seeking access after becoming the EU&rsquo;s newest members in 2007.</p>
<p>Their application was put on the backburner on 22 September when Finland and the Netherlands vetoed their entry, citing concerns about corruption, questioning the robustness of legal reforms and expressing doubts about their ability to secure the EU&rsquo;s external border.</p>
<p>But Moraes says Bulgaria and Romania&rsquo;s progress in these areas has been &#8220;greater than has been widely reported&#8221;. And although he accepts that they &#8220;clearly have issues with crime and internal security,&#8221; the evidence suggests they have made &#8220;great improvements&#8221;. In his view, the Dutch and Finnish objections are not legitimate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think what people have to do is what other EU countries have done  &mdash;  which is look at the evidence and not be afraid of their own right wing populist parties, which is what&rsquo;s happened.&#8221; Moraes blames what he sees as the malign influence on their respective governments of Geert Wilders&rsquo; Freedom party in the Netherlands and Timo Soini&rsquo;s True Finns, who have made immigration a &#8220;toxic&#8221; issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a sign of things to come, with countries that have had fairly fast and recent growth of xenophobic and far right parties,&#8221; he says. Another example he uses is Denmark, where the previous government, under pressure from the right wing Danish People&rsquo;s Party, caused controversy by announcing the reintroduction of controls on its borders with Sweden and Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Danes before their election closed the customs element of Schengen, and again nobody with any real honesty or analysis would say that was done other than for electoral purposes,&#8221; Moraes claims, pointing out that the country also opts out of EU justice and home affairs. The newly elected centre-left government led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt&rsquo;s Social Democrats has already said it will revoke the border controls.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t the influence of the right that blocked Bulgaria and Romania&rsquo;s progress, then, Moraes asks: &#8220;Why just the Netherlands and Finland? I think it&rsquo;s too coincidental.&#8221; He says all EU countries are concerned about cross-border and organised crime but had &#8220;looked at the assessment of how Bulgaria and Romania have tried to clamp down on these issues&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nor does he accept that the Dutch and Finnish governments were merely reflecting the will of the people in a European environment increasingly sceptical about deeper integration. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a question of public opinion being rejected by the elite, as it were. I think it&rsquo;s a question of far right political pressure calling the shots in countries where I think governments and people, if they saw the evidence, would be positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In September the Polish EU presidency proposed a compromise deal which would have seen Bulgaria and Romania&rsquo;s air and sea ports opened this year and a decision on land borders delayed until 2012. But Moraes opposes such a deal, saying: &#8220;Either they&rsquo;re in or they&rsquo;re not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Comparing it to the approach taken to Turkey&rsquo;s much-delayed accession to the EU, with opposition from France and Germany dressed up as &#8220;imaginary political and diplomatic steps,&#8221; he adds: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want on a micro level that to happen with Romania and Bulgaria. Either they&rsquo;re fit to join or they&rsquo;re not. I think the staging of it is a spurious way of dealing with the issue. It creates doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moraes is more positive about the European Commission&rsquo;s recently announced plans for the reform of Schengen, devised in part as a response to the unilateral introduction of controls on the Italian and French border after an influx of migrants from North Africa in the wake of the Arab spring. The changes, already opposed by a number of member states, hand greater control over Schengen to the commission.</p>
<p>Under the new rules  &mdash;  should they be approved  &mdash;  countries will be allowed to reintroduce controls for five days, in emergencies. Apart from that, the permission of the commission and fellow Schengen members will be required. &#8220;The big positive is that Italy and France will not be able to do again what they did before,&#8221; Moraes says, though he has reservations about the potential to shut a country out of Schengen if they break the rules, and the possibility of creating new grounds for re-imposing border checks.</p>
<p>Moraes is a British MEP, and the UK is one of only three EU countries, the other being Ireland and Cyprus, that have not implemented Schengen. He believes that was the wrong decision. &#8220;&#8221;I&rsquo;ve always supported British membership of Schengen, and always though it was hypocritical of [former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret] Thatcher to say no to Schengen but yes to all the security measures in Schengen.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was blocking Britain out of the economic and cultural benefits, and the sheer inconvenience of it at ports and airports, while buying into the second element of Schengen which were the security measures.&#8221; Britain &#8220;wanted to have our cake and eat it,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That was always unfair and contributed to the fact that Schengen didn&rsquo;t become a complete EU-wide benefit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bulgaria and Romania do want to join Schengen and being excluded is a &#8220;major issue&#8221; for them, Moraes believes. Both countries have &#8220;improved as nations socially and culturally&#8221; since joining the EU, and should be allowed to take advantage of &#8220;one of the big advantages of membership&#8221;.</p>

		<p>This whole article illustrates the lunacy of the EU.<br>
 Basically you have an Indian resident in Britain, who was made an MEP in Britain, lecturing to the sovereign nation of Denmark that Denmark must accept unlimited ingress of most likely Roma Gypsies living in Romania and Bulgaria.<br>
  The sooner the EU crashes and burns, the better.</p>

		<p>How interesting that Moraes condemns the popular sentiment of the European peoples!  Aren&rsquo;t folks in republics supposed to express their wills in political fashion?  Leftists such as he have gotten so full of hubris that they have no qualms about complaining about populists speaking their minds.  They&rsquo;ll tell us what to think!  <br>
Of course, the fact is that most people in Western countries do not agree with the cultural liberalism being espoused by some of their leaders and by their MSM.  Immigrants of non-Germanic, non-Celtic descent are bringing crime and economic collapse to Western Europe.  Moslems are attempting to change the entire cultural makeup of the region.  There comes a point at which people will simply not take it anymore.  </p>

<p>Yes, poster. But who is responsible for the invasion of Moslems. etc. into Europe in the first place? The people? No. Their own governments and the enemies within is more like it. The same with the immigration invasion into the USA and into ALL White nations. They all have a common denominator. Look for it.</p>

		<p>Have you noticed that no person or party is ever called &#8220;far left&#8221; by the media or by politicians?  That&rsquo;s because the media *is* far left, so sees nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, wanting to control your borders is enough to make you &#8220;far right&#8221;.<br>

<p>But still, the flow of Muslims is part of the Islamic plans as well. Just as the flow of Mexicans is driven by political efforts of the Mexican government, Muslims are commanded by their ideology and their leaders to invade and destroy Europe and all non-Muslim lands. </p>
<p>Liberals want to be friends with everyone so they simply ignore the nationalist and ideological aspirations of non-whites or write them off as being &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221;. In reality, Muslims has been waiting for this chance since the they lost Spain during the Crusader Era and lost the Balkans during the decline of the Ottoman Empire. I think they are shocked by how stupid the same people who smashed them at Lepanto have become. </p>

		<p>Moraes was born in India and was taken to the UK by his immigrant parents when he was six years old.  They or him are not British.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;But Moraes says Bulgaria and Romania&rsquo;s progress in these areas has been &ldquo;greater than has been widely reported&rdquo;. And although he accepts that they &ldquo;clearly have issues with crime and internal security,&rdquo; the evidence suggests they have made &ldquo;great improvements&rdquo;. In his view, the Dutch and Finnish objections are not legitimate.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Bulgaria and Romania have highly significant numbers of non-White ethnicities in their populations already, e.g Romany, Turkic and Albanian, and letting them in to the passport-free travel zone - Schengen along with the admittance of Turkey into the EU which Moraes also demands, will help to further dramatically increase the clout of non-Whites within the political and judicial spheres of the EU, allowing them to exercise via Affirmative Action, ever-increasing levels of power over every White native in every ancestral White European homelands.  </p>
<p>Unless we see the exact same development in the opposite scenario, (Whites being permitted to locate to theirs&rsquo; and demand high-profile positions via Affirmative Action, enabling them to attain ever-increasing power and rule over the black/brown masses in ancestral non-White homelands abroad then non-Whites have no rights whatsoever to occupy positions of high-profile, power and influence in ancestral White homelands.  All of them must be banned from holding such positions and hopefully, in the near future, they will indeed be banned from doing so for good.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I think what people have to do is what other EU countries have done &mdash; which is look at the evidence and not be afraid of their own right wing populist parties, which is what&rsquo;s happened.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>So, what Moraes is really saying is all that EU countries have to do is look at the evidence and not be afraid of their right wing populist parties gaining increasing popular support with the White native electorate because the ruling elite can always rely on the rigged vote if need be as a way of keeping them out just as Denmark has recently managed to do including the ongoing facilitating of relentless non-stop importation of non-White ethnicities to dilute the native White vote which methods have always proven to be sure-fire winners for both the residing White Marxist Liberal ruling elite and the ambitious non-White Usurper alike.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Moraes blames what he sees as the malign influence on their respective governments of Geert Wilders&rsquo; Freedom party in the Netherlands and Timo Soini&rsquo;s True Finns, who have made immigration a &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; issue.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Oh dear, this won&rsquo;t do and can&rsquo;t be allowed to develop.  </p>
<p>Us non-Whites can&rsquo;t have Whitey getting off his knees and on to his pedestal demanding to take back his own homeland.  That would really &#8216;put the spanner in the works&rsquo; for us wily non-Whites trying to weedle our ways into the political and judicial arenas so as to take over Whitey, his ancestral lands, inventions and creations.</p>
<p><i><b>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sign of things to come, with countries that have had fairly fast and recent growth of xenophobic and far right parties,&rdquo; he says.</b></i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Whites are at last removing their self-imposed blinkers and this could spell big trouble for us non-White invaders whose secret ambitions are is to steal <b>every</b> ancestral White homeland for ourselves at which point we can collectively then create and enact laws designed to dispossess Whites altogether of their respective ancestral homelands, outlaw White native cultures and traditions, and later enslave them.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Another example he uses is Denmark, where the previous government, under pressure from the right wing Danish People&rsquo;s Party, caused controversy by announcing the reintroduction of controls on its borders with Sweden and Germany.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>How dare an ancestral White country reintroduce border controls in attempts to protect its homeland and citizens, and to seek to keep out undesireables who would destroy its land(s) and people(s).</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The Danes before their election closed the customs element of Schengen, and again nobody with any real honesty or analysis would say that was done other than for electoral purposes,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter a damn if the borders of White ancestral homelands are left wide open to people/gun/drug smugglers/traffickers,and incognito terrorists.  </p>
<p>How dare any ancestral White homeland try to keep out such highly dangerous and destructive elements!!!</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Moraes claims, pointing out that the country also opts out of EU justice and home affairs.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>Again, how dare an ancestral White homeland chose to retain some measure of sovereignty and control over its own affairs and instead not subscribe to the Marxist Liberal ruling elite brand of justice which designates the criminal as the victim and the victim as the criminal, which allows Third World terrorists, people/drug/gun smugglers to run amok with impunity, raping, mugging and murdering members of indigenous White host nations, which refuses to deport non-indigenous criminals in case their lives are comprised back home and their human rights infringed, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter a tinker&rsquo;s cuss if the lives of indigenous White peoples are imperiled by the presence of such pondlife swarming all over their ancestral White homelands nor whether <b>theirs</b> or their loved ones&rsquo; human rights are infringed.<br>
 <br>
<i>&#8220;The newly elected centre-left government led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt&rsquo;s Social Democrats has already said it will revoke the border controls.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Translation:</p>
<p>This is music to the ears of Moraes and his non-White brethren, of course, because those non-Whites already insitu (and countless more on the way), enjoying all those lovely unearned benefits being dished out by the current self-loathing White guilt-tripping Danish Marxist Liberal elite at their own indigenous people&rsquo;s expense, can breathe a tad easier and lap it up in Denmark for a little while longer.<br>
