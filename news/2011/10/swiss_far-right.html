			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), October 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While the SVP&rsquo;s anti-immigrant campaigns, including calls to ban minarets and expel foreign criminals, have drawn sharp criticism on the international arena including from the United Nations, the party has managed to increase its vote share in successive Swiss elections.</p>
<p>In 2003, the party obtained 26.6 per cent of votes case. At the last elections that improved to 28.9 per cent.</p>
<p>Those 1997 results were the highest for any Swiss party since the introduction of the proportional representation system in 1919, an SVP spokesman said.</p>
<p>Crossing the 30 per cent mark &#8220;would therefore be a new record,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The latest opinion polls showed 29.3 per cent of voters planning to back the SVP, far more than the next most popular party the Socialists, with just 19.9 per cent.</p>
<p>That could bolster the populist party&rsquo;s case for greater cabinet representation.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s the seven ministerial posts have been allotted to the country&rsquo;s four biggest political parties  &mdash;  two seats each for the centre-right Radicals, Christian Democrats and the Socialists, with the remaining seat going to the SVP.</p>
<p>That balance changed briefly when the SVP gained a second seat after their strong 2003 election showing.</p>
<p>However, one of the two SVP ministers was ousted from the party due to in-fighting, leaving it with effectively one cabinet seat again.</p>
<p>Ahead of the October 23 elections, the SVP has threatened to form its own coalition if it is not guaranteed a second cabinet post.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me it means that as the biggest party, we have the mandate to form the government,&#8221; the party&rsquo;s chairman Toni Brunner told the ZentralSchweiz newspaper.</p>
<p>The SVP was created in 1971 from a merger between a party of farmers and sole traders and the democrats of cantons Graubuenden and Glarus.</p>
<p>In its nascent years, it represented primarily the interests of rural workers and smallholders, but later grew to encompass other professions.</p>
<p>Swiss political analyst Pascal Sciarini said the SVP is &#8220;a party that is very difficult to classify.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a right-wing party. A liberal party from the economic point of view, and national conservative in terms of values and culture. A party that fights to safeguard Swiss sovereignty and Swiss traditions,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Members of the party are often &#8220;very conservative, very nationalist, certainly xenophobic,&#8221; said Sciarini.</p>
<p>It is best known for its anti-immigration platform.</p>
<p>Bankrolled by billionaire industrialists such as the party&rsquo;s former leader Christoph Blocher, the SVP has stirred up controversy with its campaigns.</p>
<p>During the previous election campaigns, its posters of three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag prompted the UN expert on racism to call for its withdrawal.</p>
<p>Its subsequent referendum campaign depicting a burka-clad woman against a background of minaret-like missiles sticking out of the Swiss flag also drew an outcry.</p>
<p>Immigration remains a key plank of its current campaign.</p>
<p>Posters depicting the legs of men wearing suits marching across the Swiss flag with the slogan &#8220;That&rsquo;s enough. Stop mass immigration!&#8221; have been plastered across the country&rsquo;s main train stations and town centres.</p>
<p>The party has also taken out newspaper advertising recounting crimes perpetuated by foreigners.</p>
<p>In one titled &#8220;Kosovar man shoots social benefits office chief,&#8221; the party describes a 59-year-old man who shot his wife who wanted to divorce him, before killing the head of the social benefits office, because &#8220;he had received too little financial help.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to official data, over one in five (22.9 per cent) of inhabitants here is a foreigner.</p>
<p>Just six days before the polls, the party claims to have gathered enough support to push for a referendum to &#8220;stop mass immigration.&#8221; If adopted, it could require Switzerland to review its free movement of people treaty with the European Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;This result proves that the population considers unlimited immigration to be a serious problem and it wants to give back Switzerland the means to control immigration,&#8221; said the party.</p>

<p>Note the arrogance   &mdash;   &#8220;Even though the UN doesn&rsquo;t like the SVP, people in Switzerland keep voting for it.&#8221;  As if the average Swiss voter or the average voter of any country cares what the UN thinks.</p>

<p>That is an ominous prediction in and of itself.  Remember what the international anti-racist community did to South Africa?  The Swiss will get the same treatment, and there will be more dead Swiss in formerly White Switzerland than live Arabs in Saudi Arabia over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Read Anthony Jacob&rsquo;s White Man, Think Again!, and you will see the future more clearly than ever.  We are all South Africans now, and we are doomed.  Beware and prepare.  </p>
<p>As Mugabe is to Zimbabwe, so will some Swiss Imam be to Switzerland.  You know it&rsquo;s true, and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it.  Suffer.</p>
<p>Resistance to global color by White Humanity is an evil that will not be tolerated under any circumstances, except when the unmentionable tribe is choosing schools and mates for their children, then Resistance to Diversity and Defying Diversity is under supreme unction and protection.<br>

		<p>Good for the SVP. They even picked a good propaganda story to rile the voters: a Muslim immigrant kills his wife and then kills a worker at the welfare office because the invader felt he wasn&rsquo;t receiving sufficient handouts from the taxpayers.  </p>

<p><br>
America has FAR more super-rich people than Switzerland. Where, O where are OUR billionaire industrialists to bestow beneficent gifts upon the likes of AmRen and VDare? America, with 300M people and the most cartoonishly rich citizens this side of Saudi Arabia, and yet the US Racial Right has NOT EVEN ONE such benefactor. Well, none that I know of, anyway. If you can think of some right-wing equivalent of George Soros, I&rsquo;d be happy to hear about it. I&rsquo;m sure Jared Taylor would too. </p>
<p>One of the Left&rsquo;s most enduring and widely-swallowed whoppers  is that THEY are the poor, grassroots underdogs, &#8220;fighting the power&#8221; etc; while we on the Right are supposedly wallowing in big dirty ca$h constantly showered upon us by our evil Fascist string-pullers and overlords (who want to return to the days of sending little children down the mines) to whom we have sold our souls. </p>
<p>In the sick, reflexively Socialist early 21st C, the Left IS the Establishment. Grasp that and you will have the essence of the thing. </p>
<p>Oh, and &#8220;Go SVP&#8221;! Kick those black sheep right out of <i>Schweiz</i>! </p>

		<p>Slovenia was a puppet state of Nazi Germany &amp; Fascist Italy when those states colaborated with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and even recruited Balkan &amp; Soviet Muslims to kill Christian Serbs &amp; Russians, so no surprise the Slovenes again joined Bosnian &amp; Albanian Muslims in the 90s. And if the Serbs had won the Yugoslav Wars, Slovenia wouldn&rsquo;t have Gay Pride Parades and a Black African running for mayor.

		<p>One should ask oneself the simple question: Who will you trust; a black third world savage turned Christian or a white Albanian who is a muslim only in religion. The importamt factor is ethnicity, you cannot trust a third world asvage, I live in the third world and their behaviour is not to be trusted. They carry a Bible in the one hand and a panga (machete) in the other, they hate whites, period.<br>
Whites, like the Albanians and others turned to the muslim faith for external reasons; they get carried away with the religion itself. The white muslims in the Balkan states became muslims hundreds of years ago to be exempted from tax. Anyone can change their religical beliefs, but you can change your race and everything that goes with it. </p>

Stop exaggerating! There&rsquo;s no way Switzerland is going to let that happen, that&rsquo;s whay they&rsquo;re taking the steps they&rsquo;re taking at this moment. There are no parallel societies in Switzerland like South Africa had. Switzerland just wants to get rid of the riff-raff and I admire them for it.

		<p>Remember that Serbia is Russia&rsquo;s #1 ally and acted with Russian support in the 90s, in WW1 and the 21st century and that Russia is currently covertly building a military base a few km north of Kosovo. The Russian media always supports Serbs 100% along with European nationalists including Ron Paul in the US and even Jared Taylor unlike the Western media. Plus Russia&rsquo;s South Stream pipeline will pass through Serbia, Croatia &amp; Slovenia, re-uniting Yugoslavia and will liberate Europe from Arab oil. </p>

		<p>Germany was allies with Balkan Muslims in ww2&hellip;meanwhile all the fighting for England and France was done by their colonial troops&hellip; Indians, Pakistanis, Gurkas, Maoris, Senegalese, Moroccans, Algerians etc. that is who took the hills for the allies in ww2.  Also, the first occurrences in modern times of white women in Europe being raped on a mass scale by non whites are by these same allies. And not just in Germany and Italy. In France it is common knowledge that the nazis very, very rarely raped women while the black-Americans and colonial troops raped almost every woman they could get their hands on and often murdered them too.  German troops were not allowed to raped their enemies women but allied troops could even rape the women of the people they were &#8220;liberating&#8221; from the racially conscious Germans.</p>

<p>I am an American who lived and worked in Slovenia in the late 90s.  I have no ancestral connection to any Yugoslav group, or other Balkan ethnicity.  I can tell you that this just isn&rsquo;t true.  There were many Serbs living in Slovenia and I worked with two Serb Women. One was somewhat nationalistic, but hated Milosevic, the other was in horror of all of it and just wanted to live in peace.  Both were wonderful, warm young women who were also quite beautiful.  I met many other Serbs there.  I even attended a Serbian Orthodox Church service in Ljubljana, where there is a fairly old Serbian Orthodox Church.  Slovenes love dancing, sports, and just living too much to hate anyone.  All these South Slavs think they are pretty special, but so do most people here in the U.S., I notice.</p>
<p>The one exception in this is some Croats.  Readers should know that there is a traditional division between Croatia and Slovenia.  But when Milosevic made Serbia centrist pronouncements such as ALL of Yugoslavia will switch to Cyrillic based Serbian language in Schools, this threatened all ethnic groups.  The Slovenians were very clever in how they set up the local Yugoslav offices and army bases for takeover.  It was practically bloodless, and there were no atrocities.</p>

<p>Catholic Slovene is doing his own deception.  For one thing, he is American NOT Slovenian.  One is Slovenian and speaks Slovene!  A real Slovenian would know this.  </p>
<p>Secondly, Arkan is the paramilitary, Serbian mafia thug he is speaking of. He did commit murder all over Europe, but all inside the world of underground, black market crime.  I was living in Slovenia when he was killed by U.S., NATO bombing and it was great. He was horrible.  Many Serbs hated him.  During the 1990-1992 wars, he and his paramilitaries raided the homes of Bosnian Serbs, stealing everything of value.  This is a different situation entirely.  In the case of the Albanian Muslim, he shot innocent Swiss on a racist rampage.</p>

<p>Even though Highduke is a Serb, and I have nothing against Serbs and want Serbia to succeed, he is one who is really twisted up.  This is what oppression will do.  Many have their own very distorted ill informed self-propaganda.  Croatia and Slovenia broke away from Yugoslavia on their own in a short, two week war.  The war in Bosnia was a separate and far longer situation that Slovenians avoided.</p>
<p>Slovenia was NOT a puppet state of Nazi Germany and Italy in WW2.  Many Partisan actions during that war occurred in Slovenia and I saw many a ruined farmhouse where supporting women and children were burned alive inside by the German Army.  I knew many Slovenians who were part of that, and had several concentration camp survivors as patients.  There were collaborators, but those existed everywhere, including Serbia.</p>
<p>It IS true that Hitler considered Slovenia as a natural part of a larger Germany, but that is only because Slovenia was part of the Hapsburg Empire, nearest to Vienna.  They have a great deal of Germanic tradition in their culture.  They share the Julian Alps with Switzerland, Austria, and Italy.  But Slovenes were oppressed under Hapsburg rule.  Their national hero  was a poet who became a lawyer, but was barred from practice by Vienna for being nationalistic.  He had lived in France and learned about people like Thomas Jefferson.  Jefferson has quite a place in the minds of the average Slovenian.</p>

		<p>Whenever I am down and depressed I check out political doings in Switzerland - nothing but great news.</p>
<p>The Swiss do most everything right!</p>
<p>But, I wonder how the Swiss Libertarian party is doing - pressing for FREE MARKETS, open borders immigration and acknowledging BIRTH RIGHT SWISS CITIZENSHIP for the children of extremist Arab terrorists clerics from Yemen!</p>
<p>I bet the Swiss Libertarian party is dismissed as a 1% fringe group of idiots/traitors, same as they are in the USA!</p>

		<p>This started out as a thread about the Swiss election. So I thought!  What happened?  How did it get hijacked into a squabble between Serbs and Slovenes?</p>
<p>Personally, I have no prejudice or favoritism toward either one. And frankly, I couldn&rsquo;t tell one from the other. But the rest of us don&rsquo;t care. This petty ethnic squabbling splits us apart and  is irrelevant to Amren!</p>
<p>Moderator, where are you?</p>
<p><b>[Right here, and you are correct.  This internecine debate about the Balkans has spread across a couple of stories and has involved the same posters.  It stops now.  If the relevant actors want to continue it, they can continue it among themselves and in another medium.]</b></p>

		<p>I thought it was asinine to mess with the Swiss?  I was told people don&rsquo;t mess with them because they control all the gold and the private citizens have firearms.</p>
