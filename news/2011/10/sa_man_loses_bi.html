<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South African Brandon Huntley has lost his latest bid to stay in Canada, after applying for refugee status, the Sunday Times reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Canada&rsquo;s Federal Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against the withdrawal last year of his refugee status.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old, who works as a handyman at a carnival, would now take his case to Canada&rsquo;s Supreme Court. According to his lawyers this would buy him another four years in Canada. He left South Africa in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2009 Huntley successfully argued to the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board that as a white man, he was being targeted by black criminals in South Africa. He claimed he had been robbed at least seven times in racially-motivated attacks.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s Immigration Minister Jason Kenney took the matter to the federal court for review. The court agreed the board had been wrong.</p>
<p>The federal court described Huntley&rsquo;s appeal as &#8220;totally unmeritorious&#8221;. It dismissed his claims that Kenney acted because of &#8220;diplomatic pressure&#8221;.</p>
<p>His lawyers Rocco Galati and Russell Kaplan said they were not being paid to handle the case.</p>
<p>When asked for comment, Huntley&rsquo;s father Robert, who lives in Pringle Bay near Cape Town, told the Sunday Times: &#8220;No, I was not aware that he&rsquo;ll be coming back. And no, I don&rsquo;t care. No comment.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Canada&rsquo;s Immigration Minister Jason Kenney wants to send a white man to certain death in South Africa.  This is why we are doomed.  Until men like him are directly affected, perhaps through the murder of a spouse or child by the browns and blacks they worship, they are our worst enemy.</p>

		<p> I just don&rsquo;t understand their logic. Colonialism is bad so they sanction and abuse the whites until they finally agree to black rule. Naturally once they have black rule they begin stealing everything they can as reparations and then the killing starts after they have gotten all that could even remotely be called justified. Somalis who are threatened with murder are routinely given refugee status but whites are told to stay and die. Whites are afraid that the South Africans and Zimbabwe whites would bring racism to their countruies and that&rsquo;s so anathema the powers that be would rather watch the slaughter until they finally have to start admitting whites but you ccan bet they&rsquo;ll wait until the numbers are small enough not to affect the PC movement.</p>

		<p>There are many issues here but let&rsquo;s take two.</p>
<p>First, is this not a warning to all whites everywhere?  You will not be able to leave your country for safe haven, even if it means leaving the United States to go to Canada or some other country still Westernized.  We are being trapped while any stranger with a criminal or diseased past is shown the way in from Africa, Asia or South America.</p>
<p>Second, when the time comes will we have the courage to save the South African whites from genocide? Probably not as a nation state.</p>

<p>The nerve, the cheek!  To claim he was put off by black violence in SA!  &#8220;Everybody knows&#8221; SA has become shining example of racial harmony and prosperity since the blacks took control politically.</p>

<p>Who knows?  Maybe they had a falling out at some point?  The better question is, why is it relevant to the story?  Very odd.  Is the article trying to insinuate that Huntley is some kind of miscreant who isn&rsquo;t even wanted by his own family?  The article should put that statement in some context, but it does not.    </p>

		<p>It may or may not be the case that Mr. Huntley is homosexual.  I see nothing in the article to indicate one way or the other.  I am indifferent to whether Mr. Huntley is or is not a homosexual.  I am not a Canadian citizen, so my advice is the advice of an outsider.</p>
<p>All that having been said - Mr. Huntley may have success claiming asylum as &#8216;a homosexual&rsquo; where claims for being white failed.  Canada has granted asylum status to homosexuals and at present does not ask for proof (whatever that might mean) that a man is homosexual - it is enough to make that claim.  Whether this is honest or just, I refrain from comment.  I say only it is better for people to not live in fear of attack due to the color of their skin.</p>

		<p>One way South Africa makes it extremely difficult for Whites to leave is by heavily taxing all they own (i.e. confiscatory taxing).  Surprise, surprise - the U.S. Congress passed the same thing when the oh-so-conservative &#8220;I&rsquo;m Not a Racist&#8221; Tea Partiers weren&rsquo;t looking:  <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10423687/1/youll-pay-if-you-give-up-us-citizenship.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestreet.com/story/10423687/1/youll-pay-if-you-give-up-us-citizenship.html</a></p>
<p>If there even remains a safe haven for Whites, you may try to get there, but without anything you&rsquo;ve earned.  America, the land of the  &hellip; yeah, whatever.</p>

		<p>The late greatly lamented blog &#8220;South Africa Sucks&#8221; ran several stories about Huntley - these included photos which (to me at least) simply screamed &#8220;gay queen&#8221; - although the articles themselves never said one way or another.  I suspect this is the source of the attitude of his father who probably hates the sight of him.  Pringle Bay is quite upmarket even by Cape Town standards (mostly high), so his family are in all likelihood quite well to do.  </p>
<p>Sorry to say but, reading between the lines, Brandon Huntley is a very poor advertisement for white South Africa potential refugees - there are tens if not hundreds of thousands far more threatened and far more worthy of that status than him. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what it is, money? Or not being white, or not non-white enough, but Canada seems to want all the worst of the worst immigrants to come here. If they are white I think they need a lot of money, since I have heard there are financial rules that they need to abide by. If non-white I guess you need to claim some sort of refugee status, or family connection or be sponsered by someone who can get you a place to live and a job or something rediculous. </p>
<p>Even for the better non-whites they harass and deport. We had a spanish teacher from Honduras about 12 years ago at my University. His father and brother were killed by the new government regime that took over some years before, then went on a murdering rampage against anyone educated. Well this spanish teacher&rsquo;s father was a school principle, so he was taken out just because of that. His brother was later caught and exectuted, and here this fellow was clamining refugee status to stay here with his family. He had a job, learned to speak English and wanted the best for his family. Well guess what, they sent him back in the end.</p>
<p>I guess he was too educated and wanted to work, so we need more Sikhs and Mexicans who do nothing but screw the system over and over till theres nothing left. Since the Chinese seem to think it too expensive to live here and aren&rsquo;t immigrating in the numbers they used to. </p>
<p>It just shows the mentality, no whites unless they have money, and nobody else unless they are basically dirt poor and want to live like parasites off of us.</p>

		<p>The amazing thing about this case was that after Huntley was originally granted political asylum in Canada by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board, the decision was challenged by the ANC government of South Africa.</p>
<p>Here is what the Minister of Defense (2005) Charles Nqakula had to say about whites and crime in South Africa - source Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Crime rate controversy</p>
<p>Later in 2006, Nqakula outraged opposition MP&rsquo;s in parliament (who were not satisfied that enough was being done to counter crime), when he said that South Africans who complain about the country&rsquo;s crime rate, should stop whining and leave the country&#8221;.[2].<br>
According to a United Nations Survey on Crime Trends [3], South Africa has the second highest murder rate in the world. South Africa also has the highest occurrence of rape in the world. Nqakula failed to realise the consequence of his statement, as many people around the world are starting to make travel arrangements for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.<br>
Nqakula was again criticized while he was in Burundi, promoting peace and democracy, while there was a spate of violent crime in Gauteng. This spate included the killings of an alarming number of people, including members of the South African Police Service killed while performing their duties. The criticism preceded a subsequent announcement by the minister that an all out effort would be made to quell the alarming increase of crime by 30 December 2006. 54 police officers have lost their lives in the first 7 months of 2006.</p>
<p>The whole case is very, very strange.</p>
