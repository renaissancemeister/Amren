			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Liz Goodwin, Yahoo! News, October 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of conservative evangelicals is reaching out to the Republican presidential field and imploring them to tone down their rhetoric on illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Land, a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Dr. Matthew Staver, dean of Liberty University Law School, told reporters today that they admire Gov. Rick Perry for standing by his 2001 decision to allow illegal immigrants who are residents of Texas to go to college at in-state rates. Many of Perry&rsquo;s rivals, as well as many more conservative activists, have laid into Perry for his declaration in a recent debate that people who oppose the Dream Act for minors who were brought to the country as children have no heart. (The studio audience at that debate vigorously booed him.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Staver also praised Perry, and said he was personally trying to convince Rep. Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain to follow Perry&rsquo;s lead on the issue. Both Staver and Land think that there should be a federal path to legal status for illegal immigrants who pay back taxes and pass background checks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But a recent Washington Post poll shows that a candidate&rsquo;s support for in-state tuition rates for illegal immigrants may hurt him or her in the election. By a ratio of more than 2 to 1, Americans say they are less likely to vote for someone who supports that policy. And among Republican respondents, that figure is dramatically higher: a 5 to 1 ratio. {snip}</p>
<p>Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said that he wants the candidates to sign a pledge saying they will eschew anti-immigrant rhetoric. &#8220;I understand that we are anti-illegal immigration and anti-amnesty, I get that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I never hear that we are also pro-legal immigration and pro-Hispanic Americans.&#8221; No candidate has yet agreed to sign Rodriguez&rsquo;s pledge.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noted as much in these pages before, and shall note it again:  Christian leaders, with a few exceptions, cannot be trusted on immigration.  Even &#8220;conservative&#8221; evangelical clergy and laymen, as this article underscores, are mass-immigration boosters.  They believe a bumper crop of &#8220;traditional&#8221; Third World newcomers mean fuller pews and coffers.  And, of course, race should never enter into the picture.</p>
<p>Christianity is a religion whose appeal is to universalism rather than patriotism.  It advocates a borderless world of the heart.  Nations don&rsquo;t matter; only salvation through Christ.  Such a sentiment may create a place for us in heaven, but it&rsquo;s  guaranteed to create hell on earth.  </p>

<p>I have listened many times to Richard Land Live on Christian radio and he is a menace to Christianity. He is for almost everything I am against. His love affair with nonwhites is obvious. Of course he loves illegals BECAUSE they are nonwhite. I believe he has an agenda just as most anti-white haters do. He talks about &#8220;love your neighbor and care for the stranger in your land&#8221; and he knows darn well it does not mean what he says it does.</p>
<p> God set boundaries (borders) for a REASON. But, Land never, ever mentions anything about that from the Bible. They all pick and choose verses they can subvert to mean what they want it to mean. I gave up on the mainstream Christian churches a long time ago and now I have given up on hearing God&rsquo;s truth on Christian radio. They are all deceivers, something else the Bible tells us about. I go to my &#8220;internet church&#8221; to hear the truths from the Bible and from pastors that know who and what these mainstream pastors and churches are all about.</p>

		<p>Yeah really.  What immigration rhetoric?  Tone it down?</p>
<p>Rickroller Perry:  Amnesty and open borders all the way.  Openly calls people heartless who oppose giving the state and Federal treasury to illegal aliens.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney:  Amnesty and open borders.  Yeah, he&rsquo;s attacking the Rickroller now on immigration, but make no mistake about it, Romney is open borders all the way.  Even if you didn&rsquo;t have his record as a clue, an obvious hint is that his foreign policy team consists of many of the same &#8220;invade the world invite the world&#8221; neo-con screwballs that infested the Bush 43 White House.</p>
<p>Herman Cain:  Doesn&rsquo;t have an immigration policy, because it can&rsquo;t be parlayed into the number 9.  But if he becomes President, and boat loads of Haitians are sailing toward Florida, he&rsquo;ll let &#8216;em in.</p>
<p>Michele Bachmann:  By far, the best record in the field, and the only one to have broached the 1965 taboo.  But I can&rsquo;t take her record seriously if she&rsquo;s only in the race to play restrictor plate racing with Romney.</p>
<p>Rick Santorum:  A poor NumbersUSA grade, he latched onto immigration control in a last ditch effort to save his Senate seat in 2006.</p>
<p>Ron Paul:  Oh no, no real border security.  That would fence us in, as if there is a throng of libertarian Patriots that actually want to flee to Mexico.  Though my esteem of him went way up because he actually acknowledges that the Le Pens exist.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich:  Basically open borders.  Put the kibosh on all restriction legislation when he was House Speaker.</p>
<p>Jon Huntsman:  Theoretically opposed to illegal immigration, but loves H-xB visa legal immigrants, and just loves the fact that they drive real estate prices sky high and price working middle class native born white Americans out of home ownership.</p>
<p>Gary Johnson:  Fair tax.  Or, something like that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to know what drug you&rsquo;re on, or what asylum you&rsquo;ve escaped.  Such a statement can only be interpreted as resulting from a serious delusion.  The only explanation for this statement that makes sense is if you replace &#8220;God&#8221; with Men, or governments, or even kings. </p>

<p>Deuteronomy 32: &#8221;When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Evangelicals, even if there <i>was</i> a lot of anti-immigration rhetoric (which there isn&rsquo;t), after the election it would be business as usual.  Unfortunately both the Democrats and the Republicans are fervently working for a non-White America.</p>

<p>No, that sentiment will not create a place for us in heaven. That is man&rsquo;s thinking, not God&rsquo;s. Most Christians do not read ALL of God&rsquo;s Word in the first place with any understanding.</p>
<p>Think about these verses for instance&hellip;does this not describe what is happening in the USA and all White Euro nations? Have eyes to see and be truthful.</p>
<p>Especially numbers  1, 4, 5 and 7&hellip;.let them sink in.</p>
<p>Curses</p>
<p>1. &#8220;I will also send wild beasts (meaning barbaric people) among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, and your highways shall be desolate.&#8221;</p>
<p>2. &#8220;Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body.&#8221;</p>
<p>3. &#8220;Thou shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. &#8220;Thy sons and daughters shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long&hellip;.&#8221;.</p>
<p>5. &#8220;Thou shall carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but little in for the locust (alien people) shall consume it.&#8221;</p>
<p>6. &#8220;All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust (meaning alien people) consume.&#8221;</p>
<p>7. &#8220;The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shall come down very low. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>8. &#8220;He shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.&#8221; </p>

&#8221; They believe a bumper crop of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Third World newcomers mean fuller pews and coffers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the coffers will not be filled by the donations of the third &amp; 4th world parishioners.  The coffers will be filled by federal, state and local goverments and the tax avoiding donations by the treasonous elites to the vampire do gooder foundations.</p>
<p>100 years ago the Churches were funded by their own members.</p>
<p>Now these 3rd and 4th world immigant churches are funded through the innumerable social services and advocacy programs run by the Churches.  The worst aspect of these programs is that they don&rsquo;t actually help the immigrants.  They just tell them where the nearest welfare office, free clinics and legal aid offices are.</p>
<p>So the taxpayer pays for both the welfare, health and legal goverment workers and the Church advocates who do nothing but send the immigrants to goverment offices as though the immigrants could not find their way to the welfare office themselves.</p>
<p>The council of Catholic bishops is on record saying that if the Pope ordered them to back off on their pro immigration stance they would disobey very publicly.  That goes against 2, 000 years of Catholic tradition, custom and law. Rule by bishops instead of Popes is Protestantism.</p>

Maybe Cain could promise to slash total immigration to a mere 9 new foreign bodies coming in per year. Now <i>that</i> would be a good number-9-based policy proposal. If he did that, the Godfather of Pepperoni might even get my support. </p>

		<p>This is why I&rsquo;m through with organized religion.  Too much compromise.  You don&rsquo;t have to go to church or be part of an organization to be a Christian.  I&rsquo;m also sick of the attitude that GOP stands for &#8220;God&rsquo;s Own Party.&#8221;  The GOP is every bit as worthless as the Democrats.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve known of a preacher that declared he&rsquo;d &#8220;cry aloud and spare not&#8221; and take persecution; yet when pointed out a few things in the Bible, his attitude was &#8220;if I preached that I&rsquo;d lose people.&#8221;  Wait  &mdash;  what&hellip;.?</p>

		<p>As an evangelical, I can tell you an acceptance of illegal immigration is not biblical and in fact those who openly push for it have fallen for leftist propaganda  &mdash;  which should make us question how good their discernment truly is.</p>
<p>Apparently to brainiacs like Perry and Liberty U (even Falwell himself got to egotistical for his own good and said some dumb things about 9/11, alas to err is human) loving others means allowing a certain segment of them to break laws and disrespect the culture you inherited from your forefathers.  You don&rsquo;t have to hate illegals to understand what they are doing is a crime (and a sin), and that we should support their safe and timely return to their home country.</p>
<p>But to throw out Christianity because a few &#8220;leaders&#8221; come down on a position that in no way speaks to the doctrinal truths of its theology shows that perhaps some on here are too simple-minded.  What we should be doing is not abandoning the faith but ensuring it is preached truthfully and accurately.  We can only change culture by doing it from the bottom up.  This starts at conservative churches and universities.  If we can&rsquo;t convince these people, we can&rsquo;t convince anyone.</p>

		<p>When it comes to race, most media &#8220;conservatives&#8221; aren&rsquo;t really conservative any longer (that is unless you mean &#8220;conserving&#8221; the anti-white status quo). One has but to tune into most &#8220;conservative&#8221; radio or television programs to be assaulted by &#8220;enlightened conservatives&#8221; falling all over themselves to prove to the world how wonderfully &#8220;color blind&#8221; they are. The more hyperbolic their color blind glee, the better. John Stossel called Bill O&rsquo;Rielly on using the seven syllable &#8220;African American&#8221; instead of &#8220;black.&#8221; O&rsquo;Rielly blew a gasket.</p>

<p> So-called &#8220;conservative churches and universities&#8221; are no better then the liberal ones. They all preach anti-racism, multi-racialism/adoptions, turn the other cheek, we are ALL brothers in Christ and God&rsquo;s children, there is no such thing as race, hate the sin and not the sinner, tithe and &#8220;feed Africa&rsquo;s poor&#8221;, forgive murderers, rapists, etc. or God will not forgive you and the list goes on. With that mindset, no wonder Whites and White Christians will soon become extinct. </p>

Who said some of us are throwing out Christianity? They are throwing out organized religion and what so many perceive to be &#8220;Christianity&#8221;. </p>
<p>There are not just a &#8220;few&#8221; leaders that don&rsquo;t preach the TRUTH, most of today&rsquo;s &#8220;leaders&#8221; whether it be evangelicals, Protestants, or Catholics do not preach the truth. The verses they don&rsquo;t like, they don&rsquo;t mention or they really scramble them to mean something else.</p>
<p>  Oh sure, they throw out a few verses and claim it means what they say it means, and far too many White Christians buy into it, hook, line and sinker. This has been going on for eons now, and most of us know there are many DELIBERATE mistranslations and infiltrators into the seminaries and churches AND in the pews.</p>
<p>Satan, himself, KNOWS the TRUE Bible better than most Christians do, and do you think he hasn&rsquo;t turned most Christians away from the REAL truth and substituted his version?</p>
<p>Remember there are only a &#8220;few&#8221; of the REMNANT left on earth and most Christians will &#8220;fall away&#8221; from the REAL truths. </p>

		<p>But the Democrats love, love, love immigrants just as much as Republicans (if not more so)&hellip; even if for very different reasons.</p>
<p>Not everyone is motivated solely by financial greed. There are many reasons why Democrats &ldquo;and their clients&rdquo; love immigration.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p> Liberal Democrats favor open borders because of their concern for poor immigrants. Rich Republicans favor open borders because they want to become richer Republicans. </p>
<p>===================</p>
<p><br>
No, John!  Naive, silly Liberal Democrats may take that approach, in all misguided  innocence. But those who manipulate them and set the styles do so because they will feel safer in a country which is multi-racial, multi-cultural, and non-white.  A country which is reduced to chaos because it has NO majority. (They have even said so!)  This Tower of Babel is their projected utopia,  not any wish to do good for others but for themselves.  Divide and rule is the basic idea.  </p>
<p>Those Liberal Democrats are just &#8220;useful idiots&#8221;. But they are not the movers and shakers who have made this notion fashionable.</p>

<p>Here we go again. As I have said many times, I am a Christian, but not of the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; garden variety. </p>
<p>You say it is &#8220;anti-Christian&#8221; to list some truths about these preachers and their churches? Do you ever listen to Christian radio? Watch their TV programs? I do. Most are Baptists and evangelicals and some are against amnesty, yet they say let them apply for legal status WHILE REMAINING IN OUR COUNTRY! We are all one in God&rsquo;s eyes, they say.  Nary a word about how the nonwhite races are flooding our land for the last 50 years. I NEVER hear them talk about poor Whites, young or old. It is always about the poor minorities and how we have to show them love and acceptance. Invite them to your church, they say. Reach out of your &#8220;comfort&#8221; zone, they say.</p>
<p>They promote African adoptions EVERY DAY (by Whites, of course) and beg for &#8220;donations&#8221; for any 3rd world cause. They are behind the &#8220;refugee&#8221; program to bring in thousands more and then dump them on us taxpayers. </p>
<p> They talked for weeks on end about the high percentage of BLACK abortions (not White ones) and were so &#8220;outraged&#8221; that we did nothing to stop this obvious racism and genocide against BLACKS! Nothing about the White genocide now taking place in their own country! They are either liars or cowards. I say they are both. </p>
<p>Did you read the article and about Richard Land? (I heard the whole thing on HIS own show!) If so, then you should know what we are talking about. He represents MILLIONS of Baptists, like it or not. People with eyes to see, KNOW what is going on.</p>

Richard Land is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the elitist One-World organization. Its goal would give a genuine Christian cause to pause, given the biblical prophecies of global anti-Christ tyranny. But evidently that doesn&rsquo;t faze Land. He fits the profile of that vile class of upwardly mobile Southern boys who will spare no effort  &mdash;  or principle  &mdash;  to gain the good graces of the Liberal Establishment.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ fearlessly spoke the truth, and never tried to curry favor with the corrupt Establishment of His day. His true followers strive to do likewise.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;What we should be doing is not abandoning the faith but ensuring it is preached truthfully and accurately. We can only change culture by doing it from the bottom up. This starts at conservative churches and universities. If we can&rsquo;t convince these people, we can&rsquo;t convince anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is all very well for Protestants, but impossible for Catholics.  We are a top down military organization.  The Pope decrees, the bishops let the priests and laity know what the Pope decreed.  We can either go along with this or become protestants. If we don&rsquo;t like it we should leave.</p>
<p>We can certainly talk to our local priest or even bishop about things.  But there is nothing we can do to change their positions if those positions are the official position of the Church.</p>
<p>Unlimited immigration is the official position of the Conference of Catholic Bishops which runs the USA Church.  The only way the Bishops would change their mind is if a Pope ordered them to support immigration restriction and to cease all their numerous<br>
services for legal and illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The Pope is the Pope of all the Catholics in the world, not just the Pope of White American Catholics.  He is also the defender of all Christians, for example in communist Russia back in the day and Arab Christians harassed by muslim majorities today.</p>
<p>The position of the vatican on American immigration is that it is an American issue to be handled by the Conference of Catholic Bishops.  Popes only intervene when it looks like a national conference of bishops is doing something against the various rules and regulations known as matters of faith and morals.</p>
<p>Immigration and most controversies are not matters of faith and morals.  So the Bishops can do what they want on immigration.</p>
<p>The Bishops favor unlimited legal and illegal immigration. Other than refusing to donate money, writing letters to Catholic publications, maybe organizing a walk out when a priest gives a pro immigration sermon or objecting to a Posada advent parade, there is nothing the laity can do.  The Bishops rule.</p>
<p>Protestant churches are funded by various sources.  Catholic funds go into a general fund and is then distributed.  Money absolutely cannot be used to change Catholic positions.</p>
<p>For example, maybe a Catholic hospital is facing bankruptcy probably because it has so many illegal alien indigent patients.<br>
Some billionaire offers to pay all outstanding bills and maybe fund the payroll and utility bills for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>But the Catholic hospital must agree to do abortions in exchange for the money. Nothing doing.  A Catholic hospital must go out of business before it does abortions.</p>
<p>Rumor has it that when the Kennedy&rsquo;s realized how popular abortion was among democrats, women and liberals their core consitutency they went all out to get the bishops conference to grant approval of abortion.  The bishops absolutely refused despite the Kennedy money and prestige.</p>
<p>Protestant churches are sometimes national churches.  Not so Catholics.  Catholic is the Greek word for universal. That is why Latin was the Church langauage for centuries, so Catholics of all nations even in Asia could communicate.</p>
<p>European Catholicism was part of Catholic history for 1800 years.<br>
FYI, the one and only reason the Church got stuck in Europe was because the Muslims conquered the lands south and east of Europe.<br>
As soon as America was discovered the Church sent missionairies. <br>
Had St Columba encountered Eskimos when he journeyed to Greenland cerca 560 AD he would have tried to convert them.<br>
Now the Church wants a revival in S. American and expansion into Asia and africa.</p>
<p>The Church is doing very well in China as a Catholic baptism qualifies a Chinese national for automatic political refugee status in America.</p>
<p>This is sad but true.</p>
<p>As far as Protestants going back to real Christian teaching whatever that may be, I do not think it is possible.  AS far as I can see, Protestantism is based on the bible, mostly the Old, not the New Testament.  Everybody reads the OT and comes up with a different interpetation. The New Testament which Catholics consider more important than the Old Testament says absolutely nothing about homosexuality.</p>
<p>But the Old Testament which Protestants consider very important considers it a death penalty offense.  But many of the Protestant Churches like Episcopals, consider homosexuality a positive good, advocate, for gay marriage, preform gay weddings and consecrate gay bishops complete with spouses.</p>
<p>Many Protestant churches do not even have Bishops conferences.  Every minister makes up his own rules.  So with everybody quoting the Bible and coming up with his or her own interpetations and rules, I  don&rsquo;t think the pro immigration Protestant Churchs can be changed any more that the pro immigration Catholic Church can be changed.</p>
<p>You can either be a realistic White Nationalists or get involved with other so called conservative causes in the hope that a coalition can be formed.</p>
<p>None of the anti abortion, pro gun, pro constitution, anti judicary, pro military, patriotic, pro capitalism anti tax, anti big goverment Fox news, Manhattan Institute, neo cons, anti porn, restoration of family values or any other so called conservative groups will help us and it is futile to think they will.</p>
<p>Christians have to accept the fact that most of the Christian Churches in this country are anti White, no matter how much money we give them, no matter if we send our Children to their schools or if we vote according to their suggestions on issues like gay marriage, pornography abortion etc.</p>
<p>My personal position is the the Catholic and most of the protestant Churches are anti White Nationalism.  I am not anti Christian because of it.  As Ronald Reagan said about the Democrat party, &#8220;I did&rsquo;t leave the Church, the Church left me.&#8221;</p>

I&rsquo;ve noted as much in these pages before, and shall note it again: Christian leaders, with a few exceptions, cannot be trusted on immigration&hellip;.</p>
<p>Christianity is a religion whose appeal is to universalism rather than patriotism. It advocates a borderless world of the heart. Nations don&rsquo;t matter; only salvation through Christ. Such a sentiment may create a place for us in heaven, but it&rsquo;s guaranteed to create hell on earth. &#8220;</p>
<p>Seek can stand up and take a bow for nailing this issue perfectly!    A really outstanding comment.</p>
<p>Also, it occurs to me - speaking of creating hell on Earth - that all of those backstabbing, treacherous, Cultural Marxist brainwashed, so-called &#8216;Christian&rsquo; Pastors in those Christian Churches in the former Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe - who were selling the same pile of fly infested horse manure that Land and Staver are now trying to also sell to the GOP - have yet to issue any apologies or words of remorse over their betrayal of their dutiful and gullible White South Afrikaner/White Rhodesian church members when they advised them that it would be &#8216;evil&rsquo; and &#8216;racist&rsquo; for them to vote to surrender the nation of Rhodesia to the likes of Robert Mugabe and his gangs of violent and murderous black African thugs.</p>
<p>Not one single word of regret or any admissions of misguided altruism have come out of the mouths of any of these backstabbing, truly vile and despicable &#8216;Church leaders&rsquo;, despite the horrific rapes, tortures, mutilations, and murders of hundreds of White South Afrikaner farmers and their families by gangs of roving, predatory, hate-filled, sadistic, blood-thirsty,  murderous black Africans - who have been given the tacit approval of Mugabe and his fellow thugs who now control the former Rhodesia.    And, you can bet the farm on the fact that neither Sand or Stavers will issue any apologies or remorse down the road in America, if the stupid GOP follows their advice and continues to turn this nation into another Zimbabwe-like hell hole for the White European descendants of our 100 percent White European Founding Fathers, either.</p>
<p>Face reality, White people.  &#8216;Christianity&rsquo; has been successfully taken over and corrupted by our virulently anti-white Cultural Marxist enemies.  As other posters have pointed out - Christian churches today are preaching every anti-white ideology and poison that the hard core left promotes.  And, the same anti-white ideology and poison that the neo-conned GOP left also promotes!   Corrupted Christian Churches are today preaching and advocating for White racial displacement inside their native homelands and for White racial genocide.  Hence, the Christian Church has become the mortal enemy of all White European people. </p>
<p>On a personal experience level, I have recently been forced to sever all communications with one of these White dimwits who&rsquo;ve been completely and totally indoctrinated by Cultural Marxist subverted &#8216;Christian&rsquo; church teachings.  I tried my level best to crack through this individual&rsquo;s thick skull on the all-important issue of race.  I tried many approaches:  the crime statistics, the welfare dependency statistics, the absolutely miserable academic non-achievement statistics, I shared articles about black flash mob attacks on white people, I shared the eye-popping interracial rape statistics (this dimwit is a White female, so I thought that might reach her), I shared quotes from countless non-white minority spokesman that revealed the intense levels of hatred and resentment that minorities harbor towards whites, I pointed out how Obama is openly and aggressively pushing policies that benefit blacks and other minorities and which discriminate against whites, I pointed out how all ethnic groups except whites have deep-rooted feelings of racial solidarity and racial loyalty.   And, guess what?   This dimwitted, Cultural Marxism brainwashed-for-white-geonocide white female moron self-righteously rejected every argument I made, and steadfastly refused to open her eyes to any of the hard, well documented,  easily verifiable FACTS that I presented to her.    </p>
<p>Thus, can anyone tell me how this modern day, Cultural Marxist poisoned flavor of &#8216;Christianity&rsquo; is any different that the wacko religious ideology that Cult Leader Jim Jones and his infamous &#8216;Peoples Temple&rsquo; were preaching - an ideology that resulted in a mass suicide on  November 18, 1978  of 909 Temple members in Jonestown, Guyana along with the killings of five other people at a nearby airstrip?    If there is any difference, then it can only be that the People&rsquo;s Temple crowd were far more mentally &#8216;sane&rsquo; than 99% of today&rsquo;s White Christians - who number in the multiple millions.</p>
<p>Therefore, I agree with the poster Alexandra - who said she was fed up with trying to crack through the thick skulls of these brainwashed Christians and their Cultural Marxist poisoned Christian Church leaders.    These people have a death wish, friends - and maintaining close proximity to people who have a death wish will absolutely guarantee to result in your death, along with theirs. </p>
<p>My advice:  Leave skid marks in the street, if you have to, but get yourself as far away from these suicidists as possible and do so as SOON AS POSSIBLE.</p>

		<p>C.S. Lewis once noted that, at the end of the age (not necessarily the end of the world, but the end of the age) the forces of evil and the forces of good will draw together like going down a pencil. As the troubles increase, it will be like converging lines on a pencil point, until BAM! the conflict ensues.</p>
<p>Andrew Fraser&rsquo;s &#8220;The WASP Question&#8221; clearly notes that the ethnobiological organism that was known as Christendom has been departed from its&rsquo; fundamental premises in America for over 100 years, and he chronicles many of the attendant factors for this fact.</p>
<p>But one thing he misses, that those of us who study theology know, is that heresy is tied with culture. When a culture practices heresy, the results are always detrimental. And there are two heresies that that the Church (all of those who &#8216;say&rsquo; they are Christians, and not just the &#8216;real&rsquo; ones) is engaging in today, that are antithetical to our survival as Christendom - i.e., Western Europe/White Race.</p>
<p>To be blunt, the older heresy is the fallacy of Man as God, exemplified by the Enlightenment on the one side, and the Papal construct of the Kingdom of God, via universal jurisdiction on the other. CF. Whalen&rsquo;s &#8220;The Dominion of God,&#8221;</p>
<p>The newer heresy is that of Dispensational Premillennialism, which every TV preacher of the last forty years has held to, promulgated, and made to seem normative. This has raised the cadre of [sic] &#8216;Christian Zionists&rsquo; (and also the utter abomination of even R.C. clergy denouncing supercessionism) as the biblical, historical, and orthodox viewpoint on the Jews/Zionism, Palestine/Israel, and the West as Christendom - when it is NOT!</p>
<p>These two pincers have reduced the voice of Christendom either to a tool of the multiculturalists (cf. John Piper&rsquo;s theological prognostications on Sarkozy&rsquo;s &#8216;metissage message&rsquo; gone wild) or the rabid right arm of &#8220;Israel, right or wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>That there are both evangelicals, hyper-traditionalists, and even &#8216;lamestream denominations&rsquo; most fundies wouldn&rsquo;t be caught dead in, who disagree with this stance, is an indication that all is not &#8216;uniform&rsquo; in the schizophrenic mess that calls itself Christianity in the West.</p>
<p>And listening to two fools from the Falwell/Dispie camp, as though they had a pipeline to God, is nothing less than bad journalism.</p>

		<p>American Christianity going brown or going multi cultural, anti White - that&rsquo;s something really bad. But it is nothing new, it&rsquo;s just another area where we have to fight - like losing the top of the Democrat Party (once the White Party in the South for over 100 years) in the late 60s early 1970s.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that White folks here don&rsquo;t try to split theological hairs about immigration and racial issues with these traitors, instead just make the case of &#8220;us&#8221; vs &#8220;them&#8221; - those in once White churches that are now against &#8220;us&#8221; and for never ending, hideous versions of &#8220;them&#8221; are simply no longer &#8220;Christians&#8221;. They should be referred to as X&rsquo;tians or Judeo X&rsquo;tians - people once of the American Christian tradition who have been corrupted by all sorts of foreign corruptions - &#8220;Cultural Marxism&#8221; is a good term to use.</p>
<p>Go with the idea that it&rsquo;s not the White congregation&rsquo;s fault that the leadership of these churches has become corrupt and also go with the idea that the Southern Baptists,  Catholic elites are just doing the same thing that mainline Protestant churches did in the 60s - embrace all kinds of nutty Leftist politics and abandoning tradition and true faith for all sorts of political &#8220;fads&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to get in to lengthy arguments with say Southern Baptists who argue that Christ&rsquo;s message and American citizenship must now be for every NW on planet earth; just take a simple argument that Satan&rsquo;s plan for the destruction of America is to corrupt the religious leaders at the top to push all sorts of false doctrines and the good, regular people are now breaking away to do things the right way in new places.</p>
<p>Always throw back the truth that these corrupt anti White American church elites are tax exempt lazy parasites, no better than welfare underclass.</p>
<p>And have some fun out there being a man of the people, a revolutionary against lazy, corrupt, rich elites.</p>

<p>What white in philly said is perfectly accurate.  A majority of American Evangelicals are for border enforcement  &mdash;  despite what a few &#8220;leaders&#8221; might say.  Why is Bachmann, a religious conservative, among the most patriotic about the issue of immigration?  What about Kris Kobach  &mdash;  one time missionary and drafter of S.B. 1070?  Or Tom Tancredo, who split with the Catholic church and now attends a conservative protestant venue?</p>
<p>Amrenners, know thy enemy.  It ain&rsquo;t evangelicals.  If we can&rsquo;t convince white, moderately conservative evangelicals to support illegal immigration enforcement who can we convince?</p>

		<p>Southron 26. A huge AMEN to your comment. Land is a careerist. He in no way represents majority evangelical opinion.</p>
<p>Anonymous 25. Let me put it to you this way. There is a lot of despising of Christianity on this site, especially in the comments sections. </p>
<p>Let me also put this to you. Aside from black evangelicals (who represent the most amount of liberal Democrat evangelical voters) about 80 to 90 percent of white evangelicals vote consistently Republican. </p>
<p>Which of these two political parties is most opposed to illegal immigration? Which party do those office holders most vociferously opposed of at least illegal immigration belong to?<br>
(Yes, of course legal immigration has to go too. One battle at a time, just like the left.)</p>
<p>Are you seeing a picture here yet of the INSTINCTS of evangelical christian voters and political activists and OFFICE HOLDERS?</p>
