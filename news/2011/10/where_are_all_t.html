			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Naeesa Aziz, BET, October 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) reported Monday that applications to medical school reached an all-time high in 2011 across all ethnic groups, and Black applications surged at a higher rate than the national average.</p>
<p>While total applications rose by 2.6 percent, the number of African-American applicants increased by 4.8 percent. </p>
<p>However, Black application gains lagged behind those made by Latino students, and the percentage increase in enrollment revealed an even larger disparity. For Blacks, enrollment rose only 1.9 percent. Among Latino med students, by comparison, applications rose 5.8 percent among applicants and enrollment was up 6.1 percent. </p>
<p>In actual numbers  &mdash;  as opposed to percentage change  &mdash;  the AAMC reports that there were 1,375 Blacks enrolled as first-year medical students in 2011, compared to 1633 Latino students, 4,354 Asian students and 12,702 white students. </p>

		<p>Having worked with latinos closely for a number of years, and then blacks for a number of years, I can say that hands-down the latinos had a much higher IQ than the blacks.  The more caucasian a latino is, the smarter they tend to be, in my experience.  Also, most latinos I have been around have generally good personalities, save for the gangero types.  Most blacks I worked with seemed to be struggling with a lot of issues.</p>

		<p>So there are 1,375 first-year blacks in medical school. That&rsquo;s probably about 1,000 more than there would be without affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Not stalking the &#8216;doctor&rsquo; producing &#8216;racist&rsquo; east Asians like perhaps they might reasonably be doing to some degree (instead of whites)  if BECOMING doctors was the real aim and making all future doctors, if white, the equivalent of blacks not actually the real and realistically more achievable aim.  On a lighter note though, with all that blood and everything, the serial killer stats amongst doctors is higher than that of any other highly qualified profession ( politicos dont count as they are neither qualified or hands on) so perhaps just being serial killers will be enough for black &#8216;rights&rsquo; activists .</p>

		<p>Remember the unqualified black Patrick Chavis who was admitted to the medical school that rejected Mr. Bakke because he was White?</p>
<p>Not untypical black wearing a hospital ID that says M.D.</p>
<p><br>
 Also consider the MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test) scores for the rejected white medical school applicant, Allan Bakke, in 1973 vs. other &#8220;diversity&#8221; admissions:</p>
<p>  College GPA MCAT verbal score MCAT quantitative score MCAT science score MCAT general information score </p>
<p>Allan Bakke&rsquo;s 1973 scores: <br>
3.46 96th percentile 94th percentile 97th percentile 72nd percentile </p>
<p>Average &#8220;diversity&#8221; student&rsquo;s scores:<br>
 2.88 46th percentile 24th percentile 35th percentile 33rd percentile <br>
 </p>
<p>          [Columnist Michelle Malkin writes]:   &#8220;Dr. Patrick Chavis is dead.  Will the liberal politicians and gullible media who made him a poster boy for government-imposed affirmative action shed a single tear, or will they continue to ignore what a shameful tragedy his life became? </p>
<p>          &#8220;&hellip; Chavis was murdered on the night of July 23 in Hawthorne, an economically depressed neighborhood on the southern edge of Los Angeles.  Three unknown assailants shot him during an alleged robbery at a Foster&rsquo;s Freeze.  </p>
<p>          &#8220;Seven years ago, Chavis &hellip; was profiled lavishly by New York Times magazine writer Nicholas Lemann.  Chavis, who made the cover of the magazine, was a black physician admitted to the University of California-Davis medical school under a special racial-preference quota.  In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court later struck down the program after a landmark challenge by white applicant Allan Bakke. </p>
<p>          &#8220;Three months later, Jane Fonda&rsquo;s ex-husband, left-wing California politico Tom Hayden, heaped praise on Chavis in defense of affirmative action.  &#8220;[White UC Davis medical school applicant Allan] Bakke&rsquo;s scores were higher,&#8221; Hayden wrote in an article for The Nation, &#8220;but who made the most of his medical school education?  From whom did California taxpayers benefit more?&#8221;  [Apparently, according to the record, below, minority-quota doctor Patrick Chavis made a HUGE difference in pain, suffering and outright profiteering.]  </p>
<p>          Columnist Malkin continues:   &#8220;What The New York Times never got around to reporting &hellip; is that the &#8220;difference&#8221; Chavis made in the lives of several young black women involved gruesome pain   &mdash;   and death   &mdash;   as a result of botched &#8220;body sculpting&#8221; [liposuction] operations at his clinic. </p>
<p>          &#8220;An administrative law judge found Chavis guilty of gross negligence and incompetence in the treatment of three patients.  Yolanda Mukhalian lost 70 percent of her blood after Chavis hid her in his home for 40 hours following a bungled liposuction; she miraculously survived.  The other survivor, Valerie Lawrence, also experienced severe bleeding following the surgery; after Lawrence&rsquo;s sister took her to a hospital emergency room, Chavis barged in and discharged his suffering patient   &mdash;   still hooked up to her IV and catheter   &mdash;   and also stashed her in his home. </p>
<p>          &#8220;Tammaria Cotton bled to death and suffered full cardiac arrest after Chavis performed fly-by-night liposuction on her and then disappeared. </p>
<p>          &#8220;In 1997, the Medical Board of California suspended Chavis&rsquo; license, warning of his &#8220;inability to perform some of the most basic duties required of a physician.&#8221;  In a statement filed by a psychiatrist, the state demonstrated Chavis&rsquo; &#8220;poor impulse control and insensitivity to patients&rsquo; pain.&#8221;   </p>
<p>          Michelle Malkin continues:   &#8220;If Allan Bakke, the white doctor [rejected by UC Davis Medical school for the sake of &#8220;diversity&#8221;], had engaged in such disgraceful behavior and met such an ignominious end, you can bet the Left would never let us forget it. </p>
<p>          &#8220;But Ted Kennedy and Tom Hayden &hellip; had nothing to say about the poor black women who were brutally victimized by the incompetent Chavis.  As for The New York Times &hellip; They &#8220;ran nothing to amend their false portrait of an affirmative action hero, or question the legitimacy of the race-conscious social policy that had made him a doctor.  A riveting, nationally newsworthy story central to the country&rsquo;s discussion of racial preferences somehow ended up completely falling through the cracks.&#8221; </p>

Oh Please! Will some of you posters Stop! Please Stop with this nonsense about Hispanics being so intelligent and able to integrate with Whites. Yes, a few European Hispanics who are largely White are able to function quite well. However, Mexicans, Chicano, Latin Americans etc&hellip; are still not White and I am not interested in including them in our race!In fact, many of them are hostile toward Whites. </p>
<p>Moreover, the majority of Hispanics I have met (like many Blacks) are far from civilized! </p>
<p>ENOUGH WITH THIS VIVA HISPANIC GARBAGE! </p>

		<p>It becomes painfully obvious to anyone who has worked with Black students for any period of time that a large percentage of them have difficultly processing and applying even the most basic information. </p>
<p>Like #2, I worked with Blacks (and Latinos) for a number of years.  The truth is that EVERYONE outperforms Blacks in educational settings. My experience with them led me eventually to look more closely at the research re: racial disparities in IQ. </p>
<p>As a former liberal, I didn&rsquo;t initally go into the experience, or into the classroom, with any pre-conceived notions about the IQs of Blacks (or with any racism for that matter  &mdash;  in fact, I had been &#8220;sympathetic&#8221; to them), but I certainly left with quite an education on black IQ, academic performance, and behavior.  So, my experience ended up being a real eye-opener for me. I know other teachers have had the same experience. </p>

<p>*You mean how Hispanic criminals dominate the FBI&rsquo;s most wanted list?</p>
<p>* You mean how Hispanics have forced our culture on us to the point where Spanish is the offical language in Miami, Florida and soon to be the case in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>* You mean how the department of justice crime statitics demonstrate many Hispanics commit crimes that exceed the rate of all other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>*  You mean how almost all of us now have to deal with telephone messages whenever we conduct business over the phone saying &#8220;press one for English, press two for Spanish?&#8221; </p>
<p>Need I go on. </p>
<p>To you and all other Amreners who have a love for Hispanics, please spare the rest of us your lame jusitifcations in supporting them. Becasue of you and other Whites like you, this nation is rapidly becoming Mexicana!</p>

		<p>What we&rsquo;ll get is many more doctors like Patrick Chavis, Jan West, Kermit Gosnell and Conrad Murray.  Chavis is the poster child for lowered standards, affirmative action and preferential treatment.  I think he was in the med school class that Bakke (the famous affirmative action case) would have been in if he weren&rsquo;t white.  He killed a patient.  Ted Kennedy was a big fan of Chavis.  Jan West is the incompetent drunk that killed Kanye West&rsquo;s mother.  He had quite a few malpractice suits against him.  Gosnell sometimes performed later term abortions.  He would deliver a live baby and kill it.  He killed a woman too.   </p>

		<p>There is no reason to dismiss someone&rsquo;s personal experience according to which Hispanics tend to be brighter than blacks. </p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (which are NOT defined by race!) range from 100% Caucasian to 100% Native American.</p>
<p>Native Americans have higher IQs than black Africans  (unsurprisingly, since they descend from the same line as the Orientals), but still much lower than Caucasians and Orientals.</p>
<p>Obviously, individuals of mixed race (i.e. admixture of Caucasian) will be more intelligent than pure blacks or Native Americans.</p>
<p>Hispanics who are mostly Caucasian will perform more or less at the same level as whites.</p>
<p>So will black-white mixed-race individuals who are mostly Caucasian - the African-American intelligentsia (such as it is) probably consists mainly of individuals who are Caucasian with a bit of black admixture.</p>
<p>Nothing mysterious about any of this.</p>
<p>People descended from the members of preliterate cultures have lower cognitive ability than Eurasians.</p>

		<p>You cant fake being a doctor or surgeon and you cant fake or being an airline pilot. </p>
<p>The biggest professional profession there is is an attorney where you have a license to lie steal and cheat.  </p>
<p>The biggest non-professional profession is a politician or a religious nutzoid wacko. </p>
<p>But why does this have to be mentioned? </p>
<p>It is hilarious to hear the lying Cain talk about riding the bus and having to sit in the back and now he owns the bus. </p>
<p>This nonsense. Cain prob never rode the bus. He is a liar.</p>
<p>Whites never rode the bus either. The bus has always been for blacks and they sat anywhere they wanted because it was public. </p>
<p>Any business that was privately owned before the age of the cookie cutter franchises had whites only because they didn&rsquo;t want to lose their business but they all had blacks working in he kitchen.</p>
<p>What is not behind stated and ignored is blacks owned their own businesses for blacks only too to keep their business. </p>
<p>Separate but equal. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the lying Cain fool you not to mention white professionals wearing coats and ties NEVER ride the damn bus anyway. They drove their own cars. </p>

<p>I see too many Amren posters who will say something negative (truthful) about one race and then &#8220;praise&#8221; another race, such as Hispanics, Asians, etc. as if they just have to say something nice about some other race of people. Why is that? Or are they really married to a Hispanic or Asian to begin with? </p>

		<p>Most medical schools require the applicant have a very very good academic record which blacks do not have. They are weeded out early and this leaves mainly whites and asians. Society is better off if blacks are steered toward sports and manual type jobs..something that is more in keeping with their mental abilities.</p>

		<p>I do feel this total denigration of all blacks is unjust, I spent most of my life living in black Africa where I met the entire spectrum of blacks, from president down to the common labourers. I personally know of two ladies and three gentlemen who were precisely just that, articulate, intelligent, hard working ladies and gentlemen  of colour. One of them was my dentist, not only was he a very good dentist, he was a magnificent tenor, his Schubert lieder was the finest amateur I have ever heard. Unfortunately for their country, they all left after independence because they did not want to be associated with the rabble that was running them.</p>

<p>Poster number 19 is correct. You need to read up on your history. (emphasis mine)There were indeed segregated buses in the South well into the mid 1950s. My grandparents made it clear to us when we were growing up which side of the bus to sit on.</p>

<p>I see too many Amren posters who will say something negative (truthful) about one race and then &ldquo;praise&rdquo; another race, such as Hispanics, Asians, etc. as if they just have to say something nice about some other race of people. Why is that? Or are they really married to a Hispanic or Asian to begin with? </p>
<p>To those posters I suggest leave your praise of another race at home where it belongs, don&rsquo;t bring it on here.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Poster number 16:</p>
<p>What I have found is that there is quite a bit of hypocrisy on this board when it comes to race and  as you state, a number of posters will denounce one non-White race of people,yet in a heartbeat, will praise another. In some case, they will even encourage miscegenation with certain groups. So called &#8220;race conscious&#8221; Whites.</p>
<p>These are the people that are a major hinderance to our cause.      </p>

		<p>&#8220;Yes, where are the Conrad Murrays of tomorrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have been following that trial (the Michael Jackson death) This so- called Dr. Murray is just beyond belief. He is a Cardiologist who did not even know CPR. I do not know how this guy made it through medical school competing with ultra sharp White ( Jewish and Gentile) and NE Asians. I smell a rat. Even AA could not get this idiot to compete with the above mentioned groups.</p>

Dat be da white boys ting!&#8221;  I also think Americans should learn MORE about the world - especially Europeans (Hispanic ones included) afnd no this is not a hindrance to our cause.  NOTE the key term here &hellip;&#8221;LEARN&#8221;.  Many people are afraid to come out as white  people who know white people are treated obscenely by black rights activists and, though many are to all intents purposes white, Jews who conflate a understandable dissociation with European descent and Christian history with hating white people (which not all the world does: China, India - not Pakistan so much -Japan etc) But many white people could associate with others who are needy of white interests.  And what could be less unwhite than, say, learning German or Italian and other such activities.  You are likely to be left in peace by blacks if you further these enthusiasms. are unlikely to be Think! What have you to offer whites? To be wasp and therefore be the public, English speaking toilet that the rest of the world leaves the junk from amongst themselves in and not vice versa. Your high horse doesn&rsquo;t smell too great either. </p>

		<p>I was a admin asst in a medical school before I retired.  I once overheard the dean of the school and one of the professors discussing a black woman student.</p>
<p>The professor said I cannot give this student a passing grade.  her highest test score was 53 percent.  In clinic she did not know what she was doing.  The dean said &#8220;you have to give her a C.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinic is in the hospitals working on live patients under the supervision of the teacher and other Drs.</p>
<p>Incompetent black med students cannot be washed out.</p>
<p>The black vs hispanic issue.  Working or going to school with hispanics is wonderful compared to being around blacks all day.<br>
At least hispanics speak in a normal tone of voice, tend to business and don&rsquo;t spend the entire day screeching, fussing and starting fights.</p>
<p>Whites are far safer in a hispanic impacted school than in a black impacted school.  At least they will not become hearing impaired ( is that the correct term of the month?) from listening to blacks screeching and screaming all day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it is high praise to state that hispanics behave like normal people in the workplace.  If you deal with any goverment agency from post office to building permits to DMVs you cannot help but notice that the hispanic clerks are competent and polite.  I would much rather deal with them that the standard grunting, growling black who does everything wrong.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like being replaced by hispanics. But I would rather be replaced by them than blacks.</p>

I do feel this total denigration of all blacks is unjust, I spent most of my life living in black Africa where I met the entire spectrum of blacks, from president down to the common labourers. I personally know of two ladies and three gentlemen who were precisely just that, articulate, intelligent, hard working ladies and gentlemen of colour. One of them was my dentist, not only was he a very good dentist, he was a magnificent tenor, his Schubert lieder was the finest amateur I have ever heard. Unfortunately for their country, they all left after independence because they did not want to be associated with the rabble that was running them.</b></p>
<p>Good golly, it is called generalizing.  All of us have met the nice, reasonably bright black.  They are not the majority.  For the most part they are a stupid and brutish race.  And even if they were all Werner von Brauns and Robert Oppenheimers I wouldn&rsquo;t want my people subsumed into theirs.</p>

		<p>It has been my experience that upper income Blacks and Hispancis get laong with one another very well. In fact, they refer to one another as &#8220;brother and sister.&#8221; </p>
<p>I even see this on television. Watch any Hispanic anchor praise any Black professional and vice versa. This includes FOX news. I saw this same dynamic play itself out at several workplaces as well.  </p>
<p>I work out at my local fitness center. Given the monthly fee, there are too many minorities that work out there. However, there are a few that do. I notice that the Hispanics and Blacks are always greeting one another. The women kiss one another on the cheek and the men high five one another and engage in various other greetings. There is one guy who is medical doctor from Chile who acts like he has never seen Black people. He is always patting Black men on the back and is very (almost too congenial) toward them.       </p>
<p>While they are friendly enough to Whites, I do not see this level of camaraderie. </p>

		<p>Brainwash.</p>
<p>There were black and white routed buses in all cities. They were not marked as such but riders who were mostly of the working class and/or minority. The black buses went into the segregated black neighborhoods only and still do  to this day. The &#8220;white&#8221; routed buses went into the blue collar segregated areas. </p>
<p>Blacks always rode the black buses and whites rode the few white routed buses. They say whereever they wanted.</p>
<p>Dont be fooled. Maybe the small town of Montgomery Alabama had a few problems the lib media used this and blew it out of proportion but that wasnt the case all over by any stretch.</p>
<p>Limbaugh was right about his lawyer grandfather telling him the media caused all the problems in America. They control dictate inflame lie and cause all the trouble. They stir the pot. They have an agenda. </p>
<p>Bottom line is blacks rode their buses and sat anywhere they wanted. Whites rarely rode the bus anyway and had their own cars and paid insurance.</p>
<p>There were no signs to put blacks in the rear. There were separate but equal water fountains and swimming pools in the city just like separate buses and there were no racial problems.</p>
<p>Maybe there were private buses who did this or a few small towns but it was not a problem. </p>
<p>You need to differentiate between private and public.  </p>
<p>Dont be fooled. It was the liberal LBJ Great Society who went into all the major cities and razed all the black owned private homes and busineses and built all the USSR type communist HUD Sec8  subsidized urban housing high rises and project homes.</p>
<p>Before the 1960s black test scores were much higher than they are today and black families were together with little to no gangs or drugs in the neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The Great Society of the mid 60s destroyed the black race in America and all their privately owned homes and businesses but this has been going on long before that. Separate but equal was the law and the most beneficial productive way to handle the race situation. </p>
<p>Brown vs Brown was the death of black education and black achievment. </p>
<p>Government assistance welfare foodstamps became the norm. </p>
<p>The ironic part is in the 21st century both races try to undo the integration mistake of the 1960s but its now just a big mess and had ruined a nation. <br>

<p>Does the name Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital ring a bell with anyone? Here was a hospital to be staffed by blacks to serve the black community of the area. Instead it became a buzzword for incompetence and laziness of the black doctors, nurses and staff. It was finally closed after failing to meet state and federal standards. As an example most nurses failed the basic skills tests in spite of repeated training. basic skills include taking temperature, pulse rate etc. How can you run a hospital when nurses are hired for the color of their skin and not their skill set?  </p>

		<p>There are a number of professions and occupations in which affirmative action is totally inappropriate, assuming that it&rsquo;s ever appropriate.</p>
<p>Medicine is one of them.  Medical incompetence can kill - there is no room for relaxing medical school standards, none whatever.</p>
<p>And how would you feel on hearing a cabin announcement beginning with &#8220;This be yo&rsquo; captain speakin&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are plenty of jobs in which poor performance can be tolerated, to a point at least, though the shareholders of such companies would not be happy to hear this mentioned in an annual report.</p>
<p>Affirmative action posits, basically, that certain persons are entitled to hold certain positions, even if normal requirements have to waived to put them in such positions.</p>

<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I worked for a number of years in a corp that did risk management for hospitals and doctors and also handled malpractice suits. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that almost all the malpractice suits were brought against White male doctors. However, at that time almost all doctors WERE White amd male. </p>
<p>As far as malpractice cases go, a lot of them have no merit. I remember one case of a man who brought his baby to the ER and it turned out the baby had shaken baby syndrome. They baby couldn&rsquo;t be saved and died. The father was arrested, but sued the hospital saying it was their fault the baby died. Another time a hospital in the Bronx was sued. Just before the trial started we found out that the hospital had been named in the suit only because the lawyer wanted to get the case venued in the Bronx where the jury would be more sympathetic to the plaintiff. Keep in mind that when a hospital gets sued any doctor or nurse who so much as said hello to the patient gets named in the suit also. So, most doctors get sued eventually and very often it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t mean much. I remember one lady who sued because she didn&rsquo;t like the hospital food. </p>

<p>Superb post.</p>
<p>Thanks for providing the detailed information about Chavis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve added your post to my arsenal under &#8220;Dangerous Black Doctors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yours too # 12.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to details of the Conrad Murray investigation.  The amount of glaring incompetency and cover-up by &#8220;Dr.&#8221; Murray is beyond belief.  The experienced paramedics who entered the room where Michael&rsquo;s body was knew instantly that he was dead, called it in to an emergency room doctor who told them to &#8220;call it&#8221;   &mdash;   Murray insisted that all measures possible, including CPR, with which he was evidently unfamiliar, be continued.</p>
<p>The experts on propofol put Murray to absolute, embarrassing shame.</p>
<p>Bon</p>

I was a admin asst in a medical school before I retired. I once overheard the dean of the school and one of the professors discussing a black woman student.</i></p>
<p>The professor said I cannot give this student a passing grade. her highest test score was 53 percent. In clinic she did not know what she was doing. The dean said &ldquo;you have to give her a C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You should have exposed this.</p>

<p>Numbers please, by specialty. Without, I will just guess that blacks are over-represented as a percentage. <br>

<p>_______________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I worked for a number of years in a corp that did risk management for hospitals and doctors and also handled malpractice suits. Yes, it&rsquo;s true that almost all the malpractice suits were brought against White male doctors. However, at that time almost all doctors WERE White amd male. </p>
<p>As far as malpractice cases go, a lot of them have no merit. I remember one case of a man who brought his baby to the ER and it turned out the baby had shaken baby syndrome. They baby couldn&rsquo;t be saved and died. The father was arrested, but sued the hospital saying it was their fault the baby died. Another time a hospital in the Bronx was sued. Just before the trial started we found out that the hospital had been named in the suit only because the lawyer wanted to get the case venued in the Bronx where the jury would be more sympathetic to the plaintiff. Keep in mind that when a hospital gets sued any doctor or nurse who so much as said hello to the patient gets named in the suit also. So, most doctors get sued eventually and very often it&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t mean much. I remember one lady who sued because she didn&rsquo;t like the hospital food.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
Let&rsquo;s fae it, there are White male doctors who are mediocre like everyone else. In fat, several of you mention Allan Bakke, he now reitred doctor who took his case to the Supreme Court in 1974 and had it settled in 1978. The fact is that he was not exaclty the best doctor in the world. He had a some complaints filed agaisnt him from patients.</p>
<p>Moreover, I would argue that if a woman or minority physician are (especially if they are older than 55) is often just as  not, more capable, than their White mael counterparts. In the case of women doctors (Blac, White, Indian, Hispanic etc..) they may not be the most friendly doctors, but they are usually GOOD!   </p>

I know you are claiming Amren as your own to feed your need for Stormfront dregs to chat with. I know you CHOOSE not to use Mesztizo because you are more frightened of seeming to indicate that all hispanic culture should NOT be dismissed as unwhite than you are of dismissing all non english speaking peoples as non white. I know that is why you throw up straw man nonsense like the names of south American countries. COUNTRIES? And all the people in the world who use it as their lingua franca AS white regardless of their race. Now who oh who sees nothing but alienation and despair at white people who don&rsquo;t use English as their lingua franca? They&rsquo;re still white. The person who doesnt see anything in WHITE bro.

<p>I am poster #37 and what is it exactly that makes you call me a troll, etc?  I will wager I make more sense than your rambling post that says absolutely nothing to what my comment was to begin with.

<p>Not true at all.  For 6 years I went to about 16 Drs at my neighborhood clinic.  16 were women, mostly White, asian and the worst filippino.  I fell and had leg, knee and hip pain for 6 years.  I always asked for xrays.  I was always refused xrays and told that I must have back pain radiating down the hip and leg.</p>
<p>The visits went like this.  Ms. Moron would come in holding my records and say &#8220;So, you&rsquo;re experiencing back pain&#8221;?  &#8220;No, I have hip, knee and leg pain.  Please write down hip and knee pain and give me an xray.&#8221;  &#8221; You don&rsquo;t understand, radiating pain, nerves send signals to other parts of the body.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally I read what those morons should have read, Professional Guide to Signs and Symptoms.  It is the authoritative diagnostic manual for Drs.  It had 5 rules for hip and leg pain resulting from a fall.  One was order xrays.  Another was observe the gait.</p>
<p>After a year, I was limping around.  Everyone I knew and sometimes perfect strangers kept asking me if I had broken my hip.  My condition was obvious to strangers in parking lots, movie lines and stores.</p>
<p>Once I read Professional Guide to Signs and Symptoms, I went straight to an emergency room.  When the thank God White male Dr came in I stood up and walked.  He ordered xrays.</p>
<p>The head of the femur that connects the hip bone to the thigh bone was gone.  Because the original fracture cut off the blood supply, the blood brought no re building material to that bone so it just melted away.  It was gone.</p>
<p>Same with the knee bone.  It too had been destroyed by those maybe 16 female moron Drs who obviously did not read their own Professional Guide to Signs and Symptoms.</p>
<p>I had the hip and knee replacement.  From now on, only White male Drs.  I also have my own guide to Professional Guide to Signs and Symptoms.  I look up my signs and symptoms before going to any Dr.</p>
<p>6 years, about 20 Drs, no xrays although I always demanded them and not even observing my obviusly handicapped gait.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m White. I think my race had something to do with the refusal to diagnose for 6 years.<br>

		<p>  Many years ago there were 5 black students in our graduating medical class. We found out later that they had actually been in a program 6 months before our class started. This class was just for them, and helped them get a start on our program. They actually started school six months ahead of us. This was kept quiet for most of our program. Funny thing is 4 of them just bearly scraped by. One was threatened to be kicked out as she had been found hiding around several hospitals, sleeping. Four of them ranked in the very lowest of our class, and required constant extra assistance throughout the program. Now with that said, there was the one who truly worked hard and deserved to be there.<br>
   Since then I have actually quit precepting new students. One of my last experiences was with a black girl that had no business in med school. She made terrible mistakes and knew no more than an average person coming off the street. I tried VERY hard to help her, but the truth is there was no help. I had to call and speak with her director. I had never gave anyone a failing grade but I could not ethically give her a passing grade. I made the call with reluctance and advised them I could not pass her. Come to find out they were not suprised. A few weeks later I started getting threatening phone calls from her family. I never wanted to play a part of that again. I do not want to fail anyone, BUT I also have an obligation to her future patients. <br>
  I followed up on her several years later and she did pass the program. So she is probably out there practicing medicine on someone, right now. This is the path America has chosen in the name of diversity. </p>

  You hit on a very important part of lawsuits, friendly behaviour. Most lawsuits are not the true horror stories you hear on TV (wrong leg amputated&hellip;etc). Most I have been involved with are secondary to arrogant behaviour (they actually receive good medical care). If people have a true understanding of medicine they would see that a lot of todays lawsuits are simply blaming someone for an unfortunate event. Take an overworked, tired, exhausted Dr with an unfriendly behaviour in the middle of this and it is a recipe for disaster. Just a quick defense on part of our doctors. For some reason some of our truly caring guys and gals out there working 80 plus hours a week are getting a bad rap, as America&rsquo;s expectations are rising higher and higher.</p>

		<p><i>&#8216;In 1997, the Medical Board of California suspended Chavis&rsquo; license, warning of his &ldquo;inability to perform some of the most basic duties required of a physician.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  posted by margaret</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worse than that! </p>
<p><i>Several hours after surgery, Mrs. Cotton was dead&hellip; Mr. Chavis&rsquo;s promoters in high places showed no interest in this story, which was effectively broken more than a year later not by the Washington Post or Los Angeles Times but a fashion magazine, Allure, in an article on the dangers of liposuction, and by Boston Globe columnist Jeff Jacoby.</i></p>
<p>As usual, the media, even after a year, didn&rsquo;t bother to report their AA hero Chavis&rsquo;s true ineptitude, even though it included a death.  Better to keep the myth going that &#8220;blacks and whites have equal aptitude, test scores and grades mean absolutely nothing!&#8221;</p>
<p>The media covered up Chavis&rsquo;s ineptness up as they do other black crimes, putting the public at risk.</p>
<p>And, as you reported: Chavis&rsquo;s BIGGEST supporters, the treacherous Ted Kennedy and Tom Hayden, when asked about Chavis&rsquo;s  &#8220;incompetence, poor impulse control and disgraceful behavior&#8221; had &#8216;no comment.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Chavis claimed racial discrimination against EVERY complaint filed against him AND he was given passes not given to White doctors.  It seems &#8216;affirmative action&#8221; extends all the way up to the medical board.</p>
<p>Better to let patients be maimed and/or die than be accused of racism:</p>
<p><i>The death of a patient in any case is a serious matter and a death following a normally safe procedure can bring swift sanctions. For example, a patient died after liposuction by W. Earle Matory Jr., a board-certified plastic surgeon in Orange County. Within two months, the state medical board suspended his license.</i></p>
<p><b>But Chavis, who is not board-certified, was allowed to continue practicing for more than a year.</b></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure which is more incompetent and perfidious:  The media or Chavis, Murray and others of their ilk.</p>

<p>Go ahead and use women Drs if you want to be disabled for life.  Because of those 20 women and minorities 16 of them women, I have had 3 hip transplants (one needed to be re done) 2 knee replacements and am in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>The neighborhood clinic by the way, was part of a hospital medical school research complex that claims to be the 3rd best hospital in the country.</p>
<p>What White men built, the women and minorities destroyed.</p>
<p>You are better off using &#8220;Professional Guide to Signs and Symptoms&#8221; to more or less diagnosis yourself.  Then go to one of those drop in clinics run by mostly immigrant Drs.  You will have to pay $100.00 for the visit.  Then, if you tell them to, they will order xrays or other diagnostic measures. Because you will have to pay for the xray and other tests, they will be happy to do them for you.</p>
<p>Sleazy as those immigrant Drs are, the sleazy minority and women Drs in the most prestigious hospitals are no better.</p>
<p>It was not &#8220;an isolated incident&#8221;  6 years, 6 to 12 visits a year and 20 Drs is not an isolated incident, especially as that hospital complex claims to be the 3rd best hospital in the country.</p>
<p>The real problem with immigrant non White drs including women is that they come from the most corrupt countries in the world.  Because they are non White women, their credentials cannot be checked and their mistakes cannot be corrected lest there be all sorts of civil rights violations, DOJ fines and lawsuits.</p>
<p>Better a not so bright American black male Dr who will do what the patient tells him, that some know it all woman who can&rsquo;t diagnose a broken bone if it is sticking out of the limb.</p>

<p>well, not really. What happened is just that the truth about Conrad Murray became known; let&rsquo;s just he went back to his natural level.</p>
<p>But no amount of Affirmative Action could ever bring back Michael jackson back to life. Thats the ral big problem about having bogus Black physicians go around practicing what could be compared to voodoo, tribal medicine, in America. Some lives will be lost&hellip;</p>
