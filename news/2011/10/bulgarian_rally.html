			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC, October 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 2,000 Bulgarians have marched in the centre of the capital, Sofia, in an anti-Roma protest.</p>
<p>The demonstrators said they were against corruption and organised crime, which they linked to Bulgaria&rsquo;s Roma or gypsy ethnic minority.</p>
<p>There have been protests and sporadic violence since the death a week ago of a youth hit by a car driven by relatives of a Roma clan boss.</p>
<p>President Georgy Parvanov has called for &#8220;an end to the language of hatred&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are marching against all parasite communities, against the mafia,&#8221; a protester named Filip told Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stand against this government and the political elite, against the impunity and the corruption,&#8221; said another protesters.</p>
<p>&#8216;Extreme language&rsquo;</p>
<p>The unrest prompted Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and President Parvanov to call a meeting of the national security council.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr Parvanov called on the media and politicians to &#8220;put an end to the language of hatred pushed to the extreme&#8221;, AFP news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The rising tension comes ahead of presidential elections on 23 October.</p>
<p>In Sofia, the far-right Ataka party&rsquo;s candidate, Volen Siderov, spoke to several hundred supporters outside the presidential palace.</p>
<p>He called for the death penalty to be reinstated and for Roma &#8220;ghettos to be dismantled&#8221;, AFP said.</p>
<p>Some of the crowd wore shirts that read: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to live in a Gypsy state.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unrest began on 24 September after a van carrying family members of Kiril Rashkov  &mdash;  nicknamed &#8220;King Kiro&#8221;  &mdash;  ran over and killed a 19-year-old man in the southern village of Katunitsa.</p>
<p>An angry crowd of about 2,000 people then gathered and attacked three houses owned by the Roma leader in the village, shouting anti-Roma slogans.</p>
<p>Small but at times violent demonstrations by nationalist youth then spread to other towns over the week.</p>
<p>The violence is thought to be the worst since 1997, when an economic crisis and hyperinflation brought Bulgarians onto the streets.</p>
<p>The Roma make up around 5% of Bulgaria&rsquo;s population of 7.4m.</p>
<p>The unrest highlights tensions in Bulgaria, the poorest country in the European Union, as it struggles to emerge from deep economic recession.</p>

		<p>The problem shared by white countries is that if one such as Bulgaria starts getting tough, the Gypsies will head for the next &#8216;softest&rsquo; white country.</p>
<p>Only by coordinated pressure and incentives can the Gypsies be induced to leave white countries and return to their homelands in northern India.</p>

		<p>Everybody hates gypsies. And gypsies have contempt and hate for everyone else. Simple as that.</p>
<p>Gypsies too are by definition a racketeering conspiracy. Two or more persons conspiring to break a law. Habitual law breaking and contempt for all laws that is a gypsy way of life and has been so for about a thousand years.</p>
<p>They do play the violin well and the gypsy guitar too. Django and all that.</p>

		<p>Americans are not used to see Gypsies. It seems that they do not exist outside tiny communities in Texas. I believe this is the most terrific population walking on earth. You were spared at least that immigration.</p>
<p>You can however easily imagine how they are with the proper analogy. You take your average Indian programmer on H1B visa and you remove him 30 to 35 IQ points, but you give him the best German luxury car. Otherwise, that&rsquo;s the same genetics, behavior, and physical appearance. Sometimes smiling but always cunning, wicked, hypocritical, and heavily prone to gang violence. Their most remarkable traits are their ability to lie shamelessly and their propensity to revel in thievery and trafficking. </p>
<p>Wherever you go in Europe, you can see metal arches at the entrance of all parking areas, even the smallest ones. They are there to prevent Gypsies to bring in their trailers and their Mercedes, when it&rsquo;s not Porsche Cayenne (I saw Ferrari twice). Naturally, they barely work and they are all on welfare (or in jail). Where I live, the richest build luxury mansions resembling a Mexican hacienda, entirely with white stones, but they do not not inhabit them nor they school their children (that, I don&rsquo;t complain).</p>
<p>If the women enter a mall, they start to steal openly. If the teenagers have access to the swimming pool, they defecate in it. You must believe me when I say that our worst Blacks are better. In Southern France, even Arabs are deeply scared of them.</p>

		<p>In the book A People That Shall Dwell Alone, gypsies are described as a group evolutionary strategy. This is a special type of ethnic group and also describes ancient Sparta, New England Puritans, Judaism, and Hutterites. I think all white activists should learn about group evolutionary strategies as something whites could organize around.</p>
<p>I understand gypsies don&rsquo;t like being named as such and have taken the name Roma. Sorry but that name is already taken in Europe by Romans and Romanians. Find another name.<br>

		<p>Is there any country on earth that has managed to successfully absorb or integrate the Roma Gypsies? No. They have been nothing but a plague on every European country they have invited themselves to. There is a lesson here. Some groups and cultures simply cannot be dealt with, accommodated or controlled. They can only be isolated or removed.</p>

		<p>Gypsies have no ties to Europe nor are they indigenous to the continent. Instead, they&rsquo;ve been a plague befallen on Central / Southeastern Europe for centuries. They must return to India where they came once from.</p>
<p>For Americans who have never dealt with them: You would fly back to  some black majority neighborhood at the speed of light. And if you&rsquo;re black and entering a gypsy settlement, good luck&hellip;</p>

		<p>My Russian wife was schooled as a young child to beware the Gypsies, who would come to her apartment while her parents were out, trying to get her to open the door.  Had she done so, the apartment would have ben looted, and she kidnapped to be sold for profit, or turned into a handicapped begging urchin.  Many&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>Beware the &#8220;Roma.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have to admit, that&rsquo;s exactly my observation of an average Indian.

<p>Being an Indian, I observe this all the time.  By the way, like someone suggested does anyone think it&rsquo;s pragmatic to send all the Gypsies back to India ? Seriously ?

		<p>The average Indian does not behave as the average Gypsy. There is a cultural originality of the Gypsies, sure. But maybe one can think of a genetic specialization, too : many gypsies (the brightest and the more normal as regards behavior) left their people of origin, and disappeared in the general population, and that phenomenon produced a worsening of the genetic pool of the Gypsies.<br>
I suppose that, in some measure, in the United States, an Amerindian who tends to be active often leaves the reservation and more generally his community and is not so much counted among the Amerindians (or his half-white children are not so much counted as Amerindians, or his grandchildren are not&hellip;) : so it contributes to produce a specialization of the Amerindians-perceived-as-such in welfare dependency, depression, etc. The same happens in some measure in France with the harkis.<br>
When there was the question of Romania coming in the European Union, my position was not : No, because we will receive their Gypsies. My position was : Gypsies are a calamity which have come on Romania centuries ago. As a European, I do not recognize to me and to my country the right to deny to our fellow Europeans (the Romanians) the entrance into the European Union, even if their staying out of the EU would be in our interest : we have to share with the Romanians the weight of the gypsy calamity. <br>
Gypsy beggars are a disgrace in Paris. Pro-gypsy PC stories are a plague in the French medias. Alas we haven&rsquo;t heard the Front National on that question.       </p>

<i>I have to admit, that&rsquo;s exactly my observation of an average Indian. These traits are become more prominent as you keep moving down the caste ladder but my hypothesis is that due to proximity and mixing with the original Indians for centuries, major chunk of Indians acquired some of these traits to a certain degree.</i></p>
<p>I have to admit that many educated Indians are able to acknowledge the truth, as you do. This is something you cannot obtain at all from Arabs, and certainly not Africans.</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that India is very multiracial. People come in all colors and morpho-skeletal traits. I&rsquo;ve even read one Indian surgeon&rsquo;s article who told that there are even regional differences in the thickness of the scalp. In multiracial nations, the level of trust and the solidarity between people is simply always much lower. That is why Indians have to be over-friendly, calling Westerners and themselves &#8220;My friend, my friend&#8221; although they barely know you. And they have to smile too much, in the aim to lower mistrust in the case they have to work with you, or to fool you when they are crooks.</p>
<p>You are probably right when you say that certain behaviors are to be met more often in scheduled tribes, and possibly lower castes. Primitive features have certainly roots in culture, but also in prehistory. Nevertheless, Westerners would follow your opinions on Dalits only up to a degree (liberals would react in horror as a principle). Unlike you, we would not try to guess an Indian&rsquo;s caste even though we know that such a thing exists (or we would ask bluntly). We would just observe him as a person.</p>
<p><i>Being an Indian, I observe this all the time. By the way, like someone suggested does anyone think it&rsquo;s pragmatic to send all the Gypsies back to India ? Seriously ? Not that they might complain but think about the scale of the operation from logistical, political and many other standpoints.</i></p>
<p>We are stuck with those various nomadic populations forever. It is impossible to send them back to the land which already rejected them centuries ago. Anyway, they often have a level of European admixture (which brought no good) and they don&rsquo;t see themselves as Indians. They would not see any Indian as a co-ethnic. There is nothing to do with the Gypsies. Even forced miscegenation by the Austria Empire did not work.</p>
<p><i>The average Indian does not behave as the average Gypsy. There is a cultural originality of the Gypsies, sure. But maybe one can think of a genetic specialization, too : many gypsies (the brightest and the more normal as regards behavior) left their people of origin, and disappeared in the general population, and that phenomenon produced a worsening of the genetic pool of the Gypsies.</i></p>
<p>All-White nomadic groups such as the Yenishes (Germanics) were equally poor, work-shy and intellectually challenged. There was certainly some natural selection at work since the XVIIth century. They were nonetheless successfully urbanized in Alsace. On the other hand, nothing worked with the Gypsies from Spain forcefully settled in Perpignan in France. There are periodic ethnic riots with the Arabs of the town.</p>
<p><b>12  &mdash;  Buridan:</b><br>
<i>When there was the question of Romania coming in the European Union, my position was not : No, because we will receive their Gypsies. My position was : Gypsies are a calamity which have come on Romania centuries ago. As a European, I do not recognize to me and to my country the right to deny to our fellow Europeans (the Romanians) the entrance into the European Union, even if their staying out of the EU would be in our interest : we have to share with the Romanians the weight of the gypsy calamity.</i></p>
<p>I wait for the Romanians to share the weight of our Black or Algerian calamities. Moreover, the Gypsies know well where to find the most politically correct country with the highest welfare (we even subsidize the trailers as housing). That is France. Even many leftists have seen on TV and on our parking places who are really the Roms in the Czech republic or Romania or the so-called &#8220;Egyptians of the Balkans&#8221;. Without exaggeration, this is Detroit on steroids. All French people can make the difference with a Romanian or a Czech and a Rom, although &#8220;Romanians&#8221; is the disgraceful &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; codeword for Eastern European Gypsies.</p>
<p>Otherwise, that is not the problem with Romanian integration in the EU. For the Roma people, metal arches over all parking areas and systematic deportation (although always compensated) work very well. That is the only immigration which is actually truly controlled, due to the apocalyptic nature of those populations.</p>
<p><i>Alas we haven&rsquo;t heard the Front National on that question.</i><br>
It just wasn&rsquo;t shown in the foreign media.</p>

<p>Similar sentiments expressed by Deniz. Shame on you both! You sound like the Bantus of South Africa, the Mexicans of &#8220;Aztlan&#8221;, or the mestizos of most of Latin America, who all argue that Whites arrived recently and therefore have no claim to remain. Ain&rsquo;t so. One or two generations, and the homeland is a foreign country. The Zigeuner have been in Europe since the Middle Ages. </p>
<p>They belong, but they bring big problems. Just like blacks in the United States. Europe and the US can learn from each other on the best methods to handle problems like this. Quiz: which Republican presidential candidate is most likely to propose that the US and the EU adopt coordinated policies on handling deviant minorities? </p>
