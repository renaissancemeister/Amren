<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a wonderful thing if far more American blacks could say the same thing?  Is it all surprising that a black man who <i>can</i> say that, and mean it, is a conservative and opposed to affirmative action?)</p>
<p>As for Cain, he&rsquo;s not the worst of the Republicans but he accepts the standard Republican view on the wars.  Despite me having some disagreements with Ron Paul he&rsquo;s still the best candidate.<br>

		<p>Right. Cain does not appear to have any white admixture that is discernible. The President too is what used to be called an Oreo cookie. Black on the outside but whitey on the inside. Cain does also not appear to be and oreo. Al Sharpton would call Cain AUTHENTIC!</p>

		<p>Many could believe that if Herman Cain is ever elected then it would be worse for White Americans than a second term for Obama, and that they shall never see again a White man at the helm of America. </p>
<p>But Blacks have lost in the short run because US demography commands that there will be one or two Black presidents at most, and then never again. It&rsquo;s obvious even to somebody foreign to US internal politics. The future likeliest candidates will indeed be White men of Hispanic heritage as they would represent and satisfy the greatest majority of the electorate much better. You will elect White Mexicans, like it or not. And you can already observe that there is no place in politics for Blacks in South America. In fact, African-American influence has already peaked and it can only run downwards fast. </p>
<p>Blacks should be really worried because this means that political correctness has peaked too. Less easy times await them.</p>

<p>Back in the 1970s he called Joe Frazier &#8220;a white man in a black man&rsquo;s body&#8221; because Smokin&rsquo; Joe dared to defeat Gumbel&rsquo;s hero Muhammed Ali for the heavyweight title.</p>

<p>I grew up in lower-middle class Detroit.  We ate corn bread, black-eyed peas, fried chicken, turnip greens, my grandfather even made &#8220;chit-lins&#8221;.  That was normal at our house.  I&rsquo;ll bet Obama didn&rsquo;t eat like that until he went in his first &#8220;soul food&#8221; restaurant in Chicago!   </p>
<p>&#8220;Soul food&#8221; is really just poor southern white food and blacks try to take credit for it.  Google &#8220;the slave diet&#8221; some time, yet another black fantasy.  </p>

<p>Moreover, the last thing we need is four more years of racial discussions where everything is filtered through black/liberal media lenses.</p>

		<p>Re. #06<br>
Good observation.  First of all, it is sobering to ask how much is reliably known about the true biography of President Obama.  We know/&#8221;know&#8221;/ a great deal that he has provided us.  But from what can be reasonably conjectured about the facts of his life, the<br>
American Black experience was not nearly as close to him as your own meal time experiences in Detroit brought it to you.   What a celluloid &#8220;reality&#8221; envelops Americans who believe we have a Black President.  </p>

One of the criticisms I&rsquo;m hearing from blacks about Obama is that Obama isn&rsquo;t authentically American black because he has no history of his ancestors being slaves in America.</p>
<p>Blacks are using this excuse to explain why Obama has failed to produce for them. Had Obama been decendents of slaves, he would have more empathy for the black condition and showered them with money and perks. </p>
<p>I suspect the next black liberal running for President is going to have to be a &#8216;real&rsquo; American black man to satisfy blacks and not simply a black man in name only.</p>
<p>Blacks think they&rsquo;ve been hoodwinked. If they have, it was because they supported and voted for the first black man who had a chance to win.</p>

		<p>Wait&hellip;are some of you actually falling for this Black &#8220;Conservative&#8221; baloney? First of all, &#8220;Conservatism,&#8221; at least in any recognizable form seen in the last four or more decades, has been a disaster for the White race! While most of us here probably are rather conservative in how we live our lives, Conservatism(capital &#8220;C&#8221;) as a poltical ideology is  a dead-end for us, and has been for ages. </p>
<p>America is an Anti-White country! Niether side of this duopoly cares a damn for our survival and in most ways are openly hostile to it. Do any of you really think a Herman Cain is anything but yet another nail in the White coffin? Is this even a question here at AR? </p>

		<p>Cain just came out strongly against abortion.  Any anti abortion candidate will lose a Presidential election.</p>
<p>That is how the Republicans managed to lose the election that got Obama into the senate the last step his handlers planned before the Presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Senate opponent was Alan Keyes, whose only interests are anti gay and anti abortion.  The idiot Illinois Republicans knew they would lose to anyone with Alan Keyes.</p>
<p>I always wondered if the Illinois Democrats and Republicans cooperated on Obama&rsquo;s Senate election.  Republicans put up a doofus who was sure to lose.</p>
<p>Once again, White nationalists have nothing to gain by supporting conservatives.  They have thrown us under the bus for 60 years.  Their causes are not the White cause.</p>
<p>If nominated, Cain will lose the presidential race because of his stance on abortion.  The Republican party will soon go the way of the federalists, whigs and populists.<br>

<p>I live across the river from Illinois, and lived in it for two years.  I watch its politics with a keen eye.  Believe me, what laughably passes for a Republican Party in that state and the Democrats weren&rsquo;t in cahootz to elect Obama to the Senate   &mdash;   The Republicans are that stupid and left wing, and also elitist.  A common joke among Illinois political observers is that the Illinois Democrat Party is run out of Cook County slums, and the Republican Party is run out of DuPage County country club locker rooms.  </p>
<p>Alan Keyes was never going to win that race because he had little money, and came out for reparations for slavery.  He only got to be the fill in for Ryan, after the Obama campaign illegally got a judge to illegally unseal Ryan&rsquo;s divorce records, because the State Republican Party didn&rsquo;t replace him with the second place finisher in that primary, milk magnate Jim Oberweis (fairly good), but instead trucked in Keyes from Maryland.</p>
<p>IIRC, neither aborticide nor homosexuality were really big issues in that Senate campaign between Obama and Keyes.  It was like this:  Obama:  &#8220;I&rsquo;m black.&#8221;  Keyes (in the few media buys he could afford):  &#8220;I&rsquo;m black, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>One more thing that might interest you from that race - Going into the early months of 2004, the two main Democrat contenders were both white.  To watch the political ads in St. Louis leading up to the March 2004 Democrat primary, you would have thought that only those two white men were viable.  But Barack Obama spent just about all of his money in Chicago.  It wasn&rsquo;t until a week before the vote that he had any buys in the St. Louis market, and in spite of that, he won that primary with a majority of the vote.  A few days later, he began his general election campaign in East St. Louis, on the riverfront in plain view of St. Louis and the Arch.  He told the local media that this was the first time in his life he saw the Arch.  That&rsquo;s how little Obama cared about anything Illinois south of Joliet.  Honestly, most Illinois politicians, even downstaters, don&rsquo;t care about downstate.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>Any anti abortion candidate will lose a Presidential election.</i></p>
<p>Reagan, Bush 41, Bush 43&hellip;none of them won.  (Though 41 was pro-aborticide, he had to feign being pro-life just to keep the peace within his own party.)</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re right though, Cain won&rsquo;t win the Republican nomination, though not for the reasons you think - he has very little money.  Romney and the Rickroller will be able to swamp the field just because they&rsquo;re going to be able to buy name recognition.  If my some &#8220;miracle&#8221; (more like nightmare) Cain wins the nomination, he won&rsquo;t win the general election, simply because he is black, and because enough racially aware whites in both reliably red and swing states will stay home or vote third party.</p>
<p>Besides, I don&rsquo;t want the Federal government to have yet another taxation vector, which would happen with a national sales tax.</p>

		<p>Just heard Rush say something about immigration and the reason it is not working as it did back decades ago. Of course, the same ole lies. He said they are not assimilating like the ones in the 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s did. NOTHING about the racial angle and WHY the immigrants of yore could &#8220;meld&#8221; together. </p>
<p>Hey Rush, a news flash for ya. It is the RACE of the people that makes America a &#8220;melting pot&#8221;, nothing else. So SAY IT, Rush!</p>
<p>Before it was the EUROPEAN nationalities that came to America. Since then, it has been nothing but NON-whites coming to America and he thinks that is okay and all they have to do is &#8220;assimilate&#8221; and America will become great again?  How long have blacks been in this country now?  Should be a clue to people like Rush. </p>

<p>You stated something that&rsquo;s a pebble in my shoe.  We are &#8220;conservatives,&#8221; with a small &#8220;c,&#8221; because we want to &#8220;conserve&#8221; our existence.  &#8220;Conservatism,&#8221; with a capital &#8220;C,&#8221; as in the self-styled right of the American body politic, will do us no good.</p>
<p>Most of the American &#8220;right&#8221; is split between what I call lamestream Conservatives (aka Reaganites), Neo-Conservatives, and RINO/Rockefeller Republicans.  When we criticize one of them, they and their apologists are so quick to tell us how they&rsquo;re not one or both of the others, especially if they think we have mislabeled them.  For instance, on Twitter, after one of the recent Republican debates, I got tired of David Limbaugh&rsquo;s Ron Paul bashing (I don&rsquo;t follow Rush&rsquo;s brother, it&rsquo;s just that someone else I followed re-tweets David Limbaugh all the time), and I laid into Limbaugh, calling him a &#8220;neo-con.&#8221;  He fired back, accusing me of slander.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s right.  Limbaugh (David or Rush) is not a neo-con, they are lamestream Reaganite Conservatives.  They disagree with neo-cons, neo-cons disagree with them, on a lot of things.  Neos, lamers and RINOs all have their internecine disputes, but that&rsquo;s about as relevant to me as the disputes that Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin had.  What interests you and me more are the ways in which neos, lamers and RINOs agree, in things with which we disagree, e.g. racial equality, free trade.</p>
<p>On immigration, RINOs are open borders, neos are mostly open borders, and while lamers are opposed to mass immigration and illegal immigration in theory, they are in practice very unreliable allies, mainly because their own egalitarian assumptions neutralizes them.</p>

Herman Cain is a disaster waiting to happen. I remain dumbfounded that seemingly sensible whites would even consider such a doofus.</p>

MAJ, I would have to agree with you 100% on this one.  I am looking at the Republican &#8220;lineup&#8221; and laughing and shaking my head at the same time. HERMAN CAIN&rsquo;T is a J-O-K-E&hellip;.! *LOL*</p>

		<p>To #24: Obama as one of the worst speakers of all time?</p>
<p>You have got to be kidding me, right? If anything, in western history today Obama is one of the finest orators second only to perhaps Christopher Hitchens. Obama is incredibly intelligent, well round, well travelled and cultured. Love him or hate him, but despite his horrible policies and his leftist Marxist worldview which I frown upon, you got to admit - them man is smooth!</p>

<p>What matters is who continues to control the occupants of the White House.</p>

		<p>Politico reported last night that Herman Cain faced allegations of sexual harassment from two women in the 1990s, prompting financial settlements from the trade association which he led and where they worked.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Republican presidential candidate, who has vaulted to the top of some recent polls, denied the allegation to The Associated Press but declined repeated requests from Politico for a direct response to questions about whether his behavior prompted the payouts.<br>
