			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Annsonita Robinson, Rollingout, October 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Washington lawmakers continue to search for areas of improvement with No Child Left Behind. {snip} The foundation of the discussion is how to better serve the 5 percent of students and schools that have the lowest performance and achievement gaps wider than the norm. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, the 2009 dropout rate for African Americans stood at 9.3 percent compared to whites at 5.2 percent. {snip}</p>
<p>The Manhattan Institute released a study in 2006 that surveyed the 100 largest school districts in the United States. It found that only 48 percent of African American males earn a high school diploma; 11 percent less than African American females. More disconcerting is the news that 1 in 4 black males who drop out of high school will end up incarcerated.</p>

		<p>53 percent of blacks do not graduate from high school.<br>
25 percent of them will in some way or another go to a prison.</p>
<p>13.25 percent. WOW.</p>
<p>Also, this shows that black women are more intelligent than black men and have different hormones and physical strength and levels of impulse control that lead to lower crime than black men.</p>
<p>I would have to say that the average IQ of an American Black man to be about 80. 85 percent used to be the standards for mental retardation, until they were changed when they realized that this would by definition make the majority of an entire race clinically retarded.</p>

		<p>Easy.  Give every black man a high school diploma as a privilege of turning 18 years old, in case he hasn&rsquo;t earned it on his own (even under today&rsquo;s laughably low standards).  That way, no black men will ever go to prison, and all those other social problems they tell us are a result of the lack of high school graduation will also go away.</p>

		<p>Low-IQ people find it nearly impossible to finish high school.  Low IQ people also make poor choices, including engaging in crime, which results in incarceration.</p>

		<p>Not said in the income equality debate and the black/white income issue is far more blacks don&rsquo;t have the requisite academic credentials.  We are increasingly a technological society, and that is how we compete globally.  No high school diploma, chances are high you will be at the bottom of society.  It not about access to education, but what you do with it.  Any many don&rsquo;t care to participate, or if they do they are unable to compete.</p>

		<p>Methinks that both the AA drop out, and incarceration rates mentioned in this article are a lot lower than they actually are. The incarceration rate amongst black male high school dropouts is most definately higher than 1 in 4. lol</p>

		<p>I have wondered, who is pushing blacks into higher education and making their lives miserable? ( while at the same time making it hard and harder for white children to study in peace and quiet). I almost said, they should look at the German school system and have different levels of schools, for different  talents, abilities and ambitions, but even then, what would you do with those blacks?  What can they do, in what field can they be successful members of society?  It is terrible to be a round peg in a square hole, and vice versa. and that is what they are. They have no business in schools that are beyond them. Who has the bright idea to insist they attend there?  <br>
What is wrong with doing what you are capable of doing well?  <br>
thirty years ago I complimented the janitor at the clinic I was taking some training at, he really had everything shining, and he thanked me with dignity. <br>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>By those numbers (48% times 25%), only 12% of all black males &#8220;will end up incarcerated&#8221;.  I thought the number was at least double that - in many high black population cities it&rsquo;s closer to 50% destined for jail/prison (of all black males, not just drop outs).  Does anyone have the correct figure?  <br>

<p>If one in 4 black H.S. drop outs head to prison, that&rsquo;s 25% of them that aren&rsquo;t on the street causing trouble mayhem and unchecked crime.</p>
<p>Just think about how much safer the streets would be if 99% of them went to the slammer.</p>

		<p>I like sayings such as:  &#8220;Black men put on jail&#8221;, &#8220;black men stuck in jail&#8221;, and my favorite &#8220;quit forcing blacks into prison&#8221;.</p>
<p>It never occurs to liberals that you have to COMMIT a crime to go to jail and they ARE voluntary.</p>
<p>Liberals have the legacy of slavery, which is untrue.  This is the legacy of affirmative action, the lack of responsibility, which is very real.</p>

<p>Oh, I know, I know.  How about the government spend another trillion or so trying &#8220;bring up&#8221; the lowest 5%  of students to the level of whites.  Maybe this time it will work.</p>

		<p>In one of his columns Bob Herbert pointed out that black high school dropouts are much more likely to go to prison than black college graduates. He said that in order to reduce the crime rate we should encourage those blacks to stay in high school, and make it possible for them to go to college.<br>
 <br>
In one of his columns Thomas Sowell mentioned the correlation between college graduation and felony convictions and pointed out that while basketball players tend to be tall no one maintains that playing basketball makes one taller.  </p>

		<p>Kind of makes me wonder how low the standards have been lowered.  Considering black IQs, the number of dropouts should be at least 50%.</p>

		<p>• The next time you hear a liberal declare, &#8220;It&rsquo;s cheaper to build schools that prisons,&#8221; cite this report. </p>
<p>If leftists were serious about preventing black incarceration, they would demand segregated schools that free blacks from performance peer pressure with superior White students. </p>

		<p>1/4 of black men?  I thought it was more like 3/4.  They are truly a scary bunch.  Yesterday a white woman (DWL of course) and her child were walking down a Harlem street, which is of course risky behavior unless you are living in a pretend utopia of Huxtables.  Unfortunately some thugs threw a shopping cart off the roof of a Target (just built recently; wonder what it looks like now) and she is hanging onto her life by a thread, the child witnessed the whole thing.  Insane by our standards, and of course not to blame the victim but would you go swimming with sharks in a meat suit?  </p>

		<p>Where did the idea that someone with with less than four years of high school is a &#8220;dropout&#8221; and unfit to work get started anyway?</p>
<p>Better to put people to work than let them hang out on the street. Until the &#8220;progressive&#8221; era people went routinely to work in their teens. Progressivism in the early Twentieth Century was a movement of affluent whites who knew what was good for everyone else. We know that works out more often than not!</p>

		<p>I have visited 170 countries. The rule is if you have Blacks in an urban setting there is always high crime. No matter if it is America, Latin America, Europe, or Africa. It is always the same.</p>
