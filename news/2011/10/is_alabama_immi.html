			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patrik Jonsson, Christian Science Monitor, October 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>US teachers unions and Hispanic activists said Wednesday that an Arizona-style immigration law upheld by a federal judge last week is creating a &#8220;humanitarian crisis&#8221; as thousands of parents keep their children home, fearing that teachers will act as immigration agents.</p>
<p>{snip} And last week, federal Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn surprised many Americans when she upheld key parts of the law  &mdash;  including a portion that says schools must check the immigration status of children when they enroll, as well as the status of their parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;This law revisits Alabama&rsquo;s painful racial past,&#8221; Sam Brooke, a staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday. &#8220;When a law that demonizes people to the point of pushing children out of schools is cheered, it&rsquo;s a dark day for the state and the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Teachers unions and Hispanic advocacy groups, as well as the Obama administration, have filed an appeal, but the law began to take effect this week. Some 2,000 Hispanic students did not show up to school Monday, according to state education officials. That figure amounts to about 7 percent of the state&rsquo;s Hispanic student population.</p>
<p>Yet education officials have vowed that even children without birth certificates attempting to enroll will be allowed to attend school. Information about a child&rsquo;s immigration status &#8220;will not be used to individually identify your child,&#8221; but rather will be used only to report &#8220;statistical data,&#8221; interim state superintendent Larry Craven said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>The statistics will be gathered by the state Department of Education to track the cost of educating illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The big question is whether the students absent this week will return once, and if, fears about being reported to immigration authorities fade.</p>

		<p>&#8220;US teachers unions and Hispanic activists said Wednesday that an Arizona-style immigration law upheld by a federal judge last week is creating a &ldquo;humanitarian crisis&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip;..&#8221;</p>
<p>Correction&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.the situation is creating a cash flow crisis.  That&rsquo;s why the &#8220;concerned&#8221; teachers and others in the school system are pretending to be humanitarians.  Doesn&rsquo;t the feds give school districts money based on the number of students it has?</p>
<p>Well, cry as they may, verifying citizenship before school entry is allowed is part of the law now, so the only way they can ignore it is to break the law. </p>
<p>Greed has become so rampant throughout the West the only way to bring it back to saner ways is to collapse the system down to the bare essentials.</p>
<p>The downward economic spiral is continuing, and&hellip;at this point&hellip;.I don&rsquo;t see anything that might stop it until it hits bottom.</p>
<p>Can somebody tell me what might be wrong with telling these people that it&rsquo;s time to go home where they belong?  And firing the &#8220;humanitarians&#8221; who are pretending to wring their hands with concern.</p>

		<p>A drunken Mexican illegal was speeding at over 100 mph on McFarland Blvd in Tuscaloosa, Alabama last year, ran a red light, and killed an 18 year old young woman from our neighborhood.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s a humanitarian crisis!</p>
<p>If the SPLC wants to do something positive, they&rsquo;ll go and explain to Latinos that drunken driving may be acceptable in Mexico, but NOT HERE!</p>

		<p>The teacher&rsquo;s unions want more warm boidies in the classroom because it means more $$ for them, at taxpayer expense of course. It&rsquo;s that simple. As for the SPLC&rsquo;s claim that this &#8220;revisists Alabama&rsquo;s painful racial past&#8221; my response would be one humungous YAAAWN. If another state, prefererably not a border state or in the deep south passes a similar law this will end all the balony about &#8220;painful pasts&#8221; in AL. </p>

		<p>I remember a few years ago reading about a DUI checkpoint on a highway.  A sign was posted saying &#8220;DUI checkpoint 2 miles.&#8221;  Cars began to get off immediately at the next exit 1 mile before the checkpoint hoping to elude the police.  There were cops at that exit and the early exiters were busted.  My point is, the families that kept their kids home are basically screaming &#8220;I&rsquo;m here illegally!&#8221;  Send agents to those homes.  Keeping the kids home is probable cause.  If they&rsquo;re legal, there is nothing to fear. </p>

		<p>I say that it is high time for liberal whites who live in overwhelmingly white states up North to stop lecturing us Southerners on the topic of race.  I am sick of it!  I&rsquo;ve had enough!  Even if this author here happens to be a Southerner, which I doubt, that doesn&rsquo;t change my overall statement considering who the usual culprits are.  Enough is enough.</p>

		<p>They can move to Colorado. Hampton Inn is firing the white employees and replacing them with hispanics. Maybe it&rsquo;s time ICE started going through these hotels. The hotels are owned and operated by Century Shree Corporation and Century Rama, Inc. ICE should do a thorough check of the owners of these companies also. </p>

		<p>*&ldquo;When a law that demonizes people to the point of pushing children out of schools is cheered, it&rsquo;s a dark day for the state and the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What about when the Supreme Court &#8220;demonized&#8221; Whites when it ruled in &#8216;82 that children of illegals have a &#8220;right&#8221; to a &#8220;free&#8221; public education on our dime? Over time didn&rsquo;t that &#8220;push&#8221; our White kids out of their schools and us out of our neighborhoods? How many of you have driven by some of your old schools years later only to find them now over run with non-Whites? Weren&rsquo;t WE &#8220;pushed&#8221; out? IMO that ruling alone encouraged even more illegals over our border.<br>
In a sane world these &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; teachers would lose their Alabama teachers cert.- would you want THEM teaching YOUR kids? -  and the humanitarion &#8220;Hispanic activists&#8221; would be rounded up and sent to Mexico, even if they&rsquo;re legal! IMO anyone who classifies themselves as &#8220;hispanic, black or asian activists&#8221; aren&rsquo;t looking out for the good of this country and need to be (forcefully if need be ) deported to an hispanic, black or asian country.       </p>

		<p>The crisis is the completely spineless fed govt that has allowed the illegals to invade our country creating a huge mess the states are attempting to resolve.  Eisenhower sent the illegals home we can do the same thing and save 116,000,000,000 a year currently being spent for aid to illegals.  Since Eisenhowers time we have spent over 7,000,000,000,000 to have illegals here in tax money.  What is the size of the national debt by the way?</p>

Aren&rsquo;t the located in the heart of Dixie?  Or better yet, why hasn&rsquo;t anyone taken a page from the leftist book of protesting and protested at these lawyers homes?  They have to live somewhere.</p>

		<p>What annoys me is the bleeding-hearts that whine that deportation might break up families.  Well, these illegal aliens certainly weren&rsquo;t thinking of their children when they selfishly decided to trespass!  The term &#8220;you reap what you sow&#8221; comes to mind here.  </p>
<p>Then said bleeding-hearts have the nerve to say that conservatives aren&rsquo;t compassionate.  Sure we are.  It&rsquo;s just that our compassion isn&rsquo;t misplaced!</p>

		<p>Liberals are still chiding the South about its &#8220;painful racial past&#8221; and the like.  Apparently, they don&rsquo;t realize that most Southerners are proud of their past and don&rsquo;t give a hoot about conforming to leftist cultural standards.  Most of us cannot be guilt-tripped, and any such name-calling and bigoted criticism will only steel our spines.</p>

		<p>I think one element of the definition of a crisis must be that it is hard or impossible to escape. When you can simply move back to your own country&hellip; you know, the one where you are a citizen, where they speak your language.. it&rsquo;s hard to take your &#8220;humanitarian crisis&#8221; seriously. Again the modern left has hijacked this lofty terminology and are using it in hyperbole form to enforce their own domestic policy agenda. This is why the right needs to take the moral high ground back from these people. </p>

		<p>I live in the Chicago area and to #6, Courtney, I&rsquo;m as fed up as you with hypocritical Libs, be they Northerners, or not.  You guys down there have SPLC and I don&rsquo;t see you folks picketing their headquarters.  This isn&rsquo;t a North/South problem.  My tax bill arrived yesterday and nearly half of it was for schools.  The school across the street from me is probaly 80% Hispanic, 15% Black and 5% White.  I&rsquo;m feeling the impact of these illegals first hand.  This tendency for southerners to keep battling the Yankees is self-defeating for our race.  Call me a Copperhead, but I&rsquo;m on your side.  I wish you guys had won the second war for independence, but you didn&rsquo;t and now we&rsquo;re all in the same mudhole.  God bless Alabama for doing the sane thing.  I hope other states will follow their lead.</p>

		<p>I saw and heard on the news last night that many of the illegals who have left Alabama since the law went into effect have moved to Oklahoma, Georgia and Kentucky   &mdash;  3 states where many of them allegedly &#8220;feel safer&#8221;. Illegal immigration has become a national problem and has been so for quite some time. The real difference that we see today is that states other than California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Florida and New York are being affected.</p>

		<p>Considering how poorly most of these Mexican students are doing in school, no great loss.  They&rsquo;re going to end up picking crops or doing manual labor anyway.  </p>
<p>I come across Mexican women all the time, all 250 pounds of them, lounging on a sofa watching telenovas while surrounded by half a dozen screaming kids.  They could, you know, actually home-school them.  No Mexican, or their white defenders/enablers, ever seems to consider this option. You&rsquo;d think someone with enough initiative to sneak across the border would be more proactive.</p>

		<p>#15 Alexandra, so true. And my answer is always they don&rsquo;t have to break up their families - take the whole family with you! THAT choice is YOURS,&#8221; along with, &#8220;Didn&rsquo;t you already break up your family when you split to the U.S.? It didn&rsquo;t seem to bother you then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say the blacks showed up at school (you know, for their free meal - certainly not for the education) and were told, &#8220;sorry, after all the Mexicans got through we were out of food, desks, and classrooms. Just go on home.&#8221;  Or, when the a notice came instead of blacks&rsquo; EBT&rsquo;s and welfare that read, &#8220;sorry, we ran out of funds after dispersements to the illegals living here. Sorry, and good luck.&#8221; I wonder how THAT humanitarian crisis would play out&hellip;</p>

		<p>Fritz, that is why I said &#8220;LIBERAL Northerners&#8221; instead of just &#8220;Northerners&#8221;.  I obviously wasn&rsquo;t speaking to people like you.  As far as my anger that is directed towards your part of the country,&hellip;.I am sorry but I feel that it is justified.  I meet far too many people from up North who have &#8220;holier than thou&#8221; attitudes towards the South and they haven&rsquo;t spent a day around a minority in their life.  I meet people like that in person as well as on forums such as CityData, on which people ask advice on where to relocate etc&hellip;..  On such forums 80% of the posters from north of the Mason Dixon line have negative things to say about the South and &#8220;racism&#8221; is one of their ongoing accusations against us.  Meanwhile the Southerners on there spend most of their time defending their region.  </p>
<p>I see your point but I&rsquo;m not convinced really that the North overall is as awake as the South on this issue.  Most of it has to do with the fact that we have larger populations of minorities down here.  I feel for now that my anger is justified, especially after looking at history (Civil War; Reconstruction; Civil Rights movement; integration&hellip;..).  Again, it obviously isn&rsquo;t directed at people like you.  And I thought I also clearly directed my anger at &#8220;whites in overwhelmingly white states up North&#8221;; not people like you who live around minorities and who know better.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what triggered my anger before posting that, was the fact that I spent the past two nights arguing with people in the comments section under an MSNBC article about this same topic.  There were far too many non-Southern posters on there chastising the South for our racist behavior.  I am sorry, but I get a little irritated when I get lectured on here about how I am being divisive, or when I am told that the North is just as racially aware as the South. I don&rsquo;t see how such a statement can even be made. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have anything against anybody on here who is on Alabama&rsquo;s side no matter where they are from.  That should be obvious.  But if Northerners are just as racially aware as Southerners, then why does stuff like this mostly get passed in Southern states?  What is the main topic of this article I might add?</p>

		<p>The misplaced altruism on one side, and the shameless Marxist tactics used by others are unraveling the fabric of this nation faster than any damage an invading army could impose upon us. We are imploding from within! The lunacy continues unchecked from the political left. Fifty to sixty years ago we were a much more stable nation than we are now.</p>
<p>I live in Alabama and this is NOT creating a humanitarian crisis!! The levels of deceit that these miscreants will stoop to to achieve their utopia is maddening! If regular citizens fought as hard to preserve our nation as these traitors are fighting to destroy it, we could possibly regain our greatness. The illegals that were here have moved on or are moving on. They will pour into other states and those states will have to decide for themselves whether to enforce the law or collapse under the weight of welfare statism.  </p>

		<p>Have your School Board hire Investigators to make sure that those who attend the Public Schools actually live in the Neigborhoods where they attend, and to also ensure that you don&rsquo;t have two or more families living in a One Family home. </p>
<p>You can stop a lot of this type of thing when you enforce your Housing and Zoning Laws. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to call the Fire Marshal&rsquo;s office and report overcrowding of certain properties. That is also a Health hazard, and you can use the Health Department to enforce those Codes, too. </p>

		<p>You can only have &#8216;hate&rsquo; and &#8216;racism&rsquo; when you combine different groups of people together.  You can only &#8216;hate&rsquo; someone or a group of people if you have had interaction with them.</p>

<p>Miss Whitey, no offense meant, but that statement is quite the oxymoron! We can and have resist/ed peacefully to no avail, to FIGHT back involves violence and that is what it is going to take, there is a reason so many White people are buying weapons and ammo and if you happen to be in a gun/ammo store you will see that it is indeed White people buying said weapons and ammo. Weapons and ammo will by our salvation, get them before the Obamuslim makes it impossible to do so.</p>

		<p>I remember a few years ago reading about a DUI checkpoint on a highway. A sign was posted saying &ldquo;DUI checkpoint 2 miles.&rdquo; Cars began to get off immediately at the next exit 1 mile before the checkpoint hoping to elude the police. There were cops at that exit and the early exiters were busted. My point is, the families that kept their kids home are basically screaming &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here illegally!&rdquo; Send agents to those homes. Keeping the kids home is probable cause. If they&rsquo;re legal, there is nothing to fear. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Good reasoning. However,I disagree on the last sentence:&#8221; If they&rsquo;re legal there is nothing to fear&#8221;. You&rsquo;re way too generous and this is what&rsquo;s destroying us.</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t want none of them here. They don&rsquo;t deserve to live with us whether they&rsquo;re here illegal or legal. </p>
