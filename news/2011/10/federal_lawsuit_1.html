<h1>Federal Lawsuit Alleges Craig, Colo. Hampton Inn Fired Non-Hispanic Workers Under Belief They Were Lazy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ivan Moreno, Huffington Post, October 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former employees at a western Colorado hotel said they were fired and replaced with Latino workers because the business owners thought white and non-Hispanic workers were lazy, according to a federal lawsuit announced Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is seeking back pay for employees that federal officials said were fired from a Hampton Inn franchise in Craig, Colo., according to the lawsuit filed last week.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims the general manager of the hotel was told by the business owners &#8220;to hire more qualified maids, and that they preferred maids to be Hispanic because in their opinion Hispanics worked harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawsuit goes on to say that one of the fired employees was told she was being terminated because the hotel owners preferred non-American and non-Caucasian workers &#8220;because it was their impression that such workers are lazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mary Jo O&rsquo;Neill, regional attorney for the EEOC, the agency that handles workplace discrimination cases, said the lawsuit is unusual because minorities are typically the parties bringing complaints forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been doing this work for 30-some years and I&rsquo;ve never filed a case like this,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The lawsuit said that between August and November, all non-Hispanic workers in the laundry and housekeeping departments resigned or were fired and replaced with Latinos.</p>

		<p>Hispanics are harder workers or cheaper labor and eaiser to exploit, as in we won&rsquo;t check your immigration status or your SS number too hard as long as you shut up and do as you&rsquo;re told? That&rsquo;s more likely what&rsquo;s going on here and I hope this company gets nailed to the wall.</p>

		<p>Well, what really happened is that the Whites were doing all of the work, and when more was added to their plate, because some special black or brown didn&rsquo;t want to do it, the Whites decided to say &#8220;No&#8221;, instead of sucking it up, and doing even more work.</p>
<p>For this, there was outrage and indignation from their Supervisors, and Managers, that these Whites dared suggest that the blacks and browns that whine, moan, and complain for the jobs, actually do some real work. </p>
<p>If all Whites walked off their jobs across this country, it would come to a sudden stop. </p>

		<p>It is good to see such lawsuits- too many Whites would just go &#8220;oh well&#8221; and walk away. At least they have documentation that this was what was going on otherwise they would not have had a chance. Also it was probably economic- Hispanics who may or may not have been illegal would have worked for far less money.</p>

		<p>From the original source article:</p>
<p><i>The hotel is operated by Century Shree Corp. and Century Rama Inc., two Wyoming corporations. Attorney Tim Kingston said Monday he could not comment because he had not yet discussed the lawsuit with his clients.</i></p>
<p>Wyoming corporations are often scammy money hustles.  There is a small brick house in Cheyenne that is, &#8220;on paper,&#8221; the headquarters of more than a thousand corporations.  I bet this is one of those Patel operations hiding behind WY incorporation documents.</p>

		<p>One thing is for sure none of those working in housekeeping were male, Hispanic, non-hispanic or white. I would guess this means male Guests staying at the hotel don&rsquo;t care what kind of female you are. Hurrah for diversity. </p>

<p>Many employers have replaced American workers with illegal aliens.  There are many places that were majority American and now the workers are majority Latino.  Something fishy here.</p>

		<p>Before the post-1965 changes to immigration and civil rights laws, most employers had little choice but to hire whites for every occupation.</p>
<p>Whites could bargain over working conditions and pay, and employers had to listen.  The economic equalibrium was established by the finite pool of whites.</p>
<p>Nowadays, too many &#8216;capitalist entrepreneurs&rsquo; with access to cheap credit can open businesses based on an almost unlimited supply of docile, non-white migrants. Without those foreign workers, these &#8216;entrepreneurs&rsquo; would have to get real jobs.   </p>

		<p>Notice that the article says &#8220;white and non-Hispanic workers&#8221; were accused of being lazy.  Just who are these &#8220;non-Hispanic&#8221;, presumably non-white workers?  If, as Question Diversity believes (#5), Patels are involved, the owners certainly don&rsquo;t mean Indians!  And just what ethnic group in this country is most often accused of laziness?  HuffPo apparently doesn&rsquo;t even want to tell us who these non-Hispanic (non-white) people are!  </p>

		<p>Gee, I wonder who all these lazy Whites are? We are told this over and over by those who WANT illegals here to work for peanuts. We are told this over and over by those who want to destroy White America. Why do we even listen to these people and their lies?</p>
<p> I wonder how America even had homes/buildings/roads/bridges/highrises/hospitals/ and you name it, built over the last hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Gee, when I bought a new home back in 1969 I was there everyday overseeing the progress being made and the workers were ALL White. Did a great job too. I remember the days when most truckers were ALL White and you could TRUST them if you needed help or a safe ride. No longer.</p>
<p>Gee, I remember working in the fields and packing houses along with 95% of other WHITES who worked dawn to dusk. I remember MOWING my own lawn and so did every other White person.</p>
<p>Most of us here know these truths,yet we fall for the lies being pushed by our enemy. Time to call them on their lies and out them for who they are.</p>

		<p>The names &#8220;Century SHREE Corp. and Century RAMA Corp.&#8221; should leave nobody wondering who owns this hotel, as with names like these, it is 100% certain that this is a &#8220;Patel&#8221; operation, Question Diversity.</p>
<p>Shree is an alternate name for Ganesha, the Hindu god of prosperity, as well as for Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth.  Rama is the seventh avatar of Vishnu (isn&rsquo;t Wikipedia great?)</p>
<p>Wyoming might sound like a strange choice, but along with Nevada, Wyoming is a well-known haven for small, privately-held corporations.  While Delaware is a haven for big publically-traded companies and corporate law there protects the rights of shareholders and boards of directors, Nevada and Wyoming law favors management.</p>
<p>With a little luck here, the court will award enough in punitive damages that the Patels will scurry back to their leper-infested homeland, minus all their money.</p>

		<p>Many years ago I applied for a job as a housekeeper at a major motel chain. The manager was making comments like &#8220;Most housekeepers in the southwest are Latina,&#8221; &#8220;My maids don&rsquo;t speak any English,&#8221; etc.  When she said this, she was fidgeting, very nervous. She made it clear to me that she could not hire me unless I spoke Spanish!</p>
<p>The reason why these Whites were fired is because the hotel wants cheap labor, plain and simple. I lived in a motel in the past. Some of the Latina housekeepers did very good jobs, some did average or below-average jobs.</p>
<p>Also, the reason some Latina housekeepers might work very hard is they are illegally here in the U.S. and they believe if they work very hard their illegal status will never be found and they could continue to live and work illegally in the U.S.</p>

<p>I think that is why there are so many competing restaurants.  Every mini mall seems to have 8 stores with 7 of them being restaurants.  There is a Denny&rsquo;s or IHOP or Waffle House every few blocks.  Seems like businesses first step is to find a business where they can hire illegal indian hispanics.</p>
<p>Business owners don&rsquo;t decide what business they want to start and then decide who they will hire.  They all seem to go for work that can be done by newly arrived illegal indian hispanics.   <br>

		<p>Knowing the way the EEOC treats Whites who are so naive as to go to the EEOC with discrimination complaints, I am sure that most of the fired Americans were black and just a few White.</p>
<p>Were all the fired workers White, the EEOC would have done nothing.  Just as the FAA&rsquo;s mission is to ensure safety in air transportation, the mission of the EEOC is to see to it that no<br>
White men and only a few White women are empoloyed.</p>
<p>A White going to the EEOC with a discrimination complaint is like a Kulak going to Lenin for help.</p>
<p>The article does not say how may workers complained.</p>

		<p><i>I&rsquo;ve been doing this work for 30-some years and I&rsquo;ve never filed a case like this,&rdquo; she said.</i></p>
<p>Expect to file a lot more cases as whites are increasingly race replaced in all areas of the workforce</p>
<p>See South Africa and its BEE program for an example, as reported by South Africa P.I.G.</p>
<p><i>Due to the political process of giving to the black at the expense of the white there are now 450,000 white people living below the poverty line in shanty towns around the country. The majority of these people are from Afrikaans backgrounds who would normally be the underclass looking after fairly menial jobs, railway workers, cleaners etc. Since those jobs are now taken by blacks these unfortunate men, women and children have no recourse but to become part of the homeless generation, forgotten by more affluent whites as well as the black government. Even some soup kitchens that were set up by well minded individuals have been closed by bureaucrats who say that the whites must fend for themselves. It&rsquo;s only the help from other whites that keeps these unfortunate people with some form of subsistence.</i></p>

		<p>&#8220;With a little luck here, the court will award enough in punitive damages that the Patels will scurry back to their leper-infested homeland, minus all their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being awarded punitive and actual damages is one thing.  Collecting those damages is quite another.  </p>
<p>The Patels are indians.  The russian armenian asian african arab persian indian israeli and other 4th world immigrants are skilled in avoiding paying damages and even ordinary bills.</p>
<p>The usual procedure is to set up a new corporation every month or so.  When creditors are after corporation A, simply move all assets to corporation B, then to corporation C while  filing bankruptcy on corporation A.</p>
<p>But before declaring bankruptcy on corporation A, be sure to order an entire brand new restaurant kitchen, washers and dryers for a commercial laundry, massive amounts of items for the convenience store, several $300,000 copiers for the copy shop whatever.</p>
<p>Then sell all these expensive items and the vendor is stuck with a million dollar bill he cannot collect. The cash goes under grandma&rsquo;s mattress.</p>
<p>You can bet the Patels have already transferred ownership to another corporation.  Most of the immigrants routinely transfer ownership to another corporation every few months, long before any lawsuits or tax collectors go after the business.</p>
<p>In the countries the immigrants come from, there is no rule of law and contracts cannot be enforced.  Employees are considered slaves from the low classes.</p>
<p>Ever been to one of those big cheap Chinese buffets?  The workers are paid nothing at all, sleep in the kitchen  bath in the pot sinks and wash their clothes in the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t Rushton ever do any articles and books about that?<br>
If chinese are so intelligent why do 80 percent of the Chinese both in China and the diaspora put up with the way Chinese employers treat them?<br>
