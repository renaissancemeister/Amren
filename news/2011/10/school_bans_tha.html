			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rachel Quigley, Daily Mail (London), October 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An elementary school principal has caused outrage by banning Halloween, Thanksgiving and Columbus day, saying they are insensitive.</p>
<p>Anne Foley, the principal at Kennedy School in Somerville, Massachusetts, sent an email to teachers warning them about celebrating Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>She wrote: &#8216;When we were young we might have been able to claim ignorance of the atrocities that Christopher Columbus committed against the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>&#8216;We can no longer do so. For many of us and our students celebrating this particular person is an insult and a slight to the people he annihilated. </p>
<p>&#8216;On the same lines, we need to be careful around the Thanksgiving Day time as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had already told staff not to let the kids dress up for Halloween, according to the Boston Herald.</p>
<p>Superintendant Tony Pierantozzi told The Herald that Halloween is &#8216;problematic&rsquo; because of connections to witchcraft.</p>
<p>Several parents thought that the principal was over reacting in her decision.</p>
<p>One told MyFoxBoston: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t think they should not be able to celebrate these holidays I mean this country was formed with the idea that everything is a free country, and they should be able to celebrate these holidays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone, who has three kids at Kennedy, also had an opinion about the principal&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I&rsquo;m the son of Italian immigrations, so I take Columbus Day very near and dear, and I&rsquo;m proud that he discovered America and that America&rsquo;s named after another Italian.</p>
<p>&#8216;If we ignore and we don&rsquo;t want to talk about it, if we want to stifle debate, then we&rsquo;re ignoring history.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kennedy Elementary isn&rsquo;t alone this year. Some schools in Ithaca, N.Y. have nixed traditions of celebrating Halloween. South Hill Elementary and Northeast Elementary Schools will not be hosting their annual Halloween parade and classroom parties, The Ithaca Journal reported.</p>

		<p>Ithaca, N.Y is a small town mostly occupied by employees of Cornell University a typical marxist controlled anti White racist Ivy League school.</p>
<p>Unlike Boston or even Ameherst, Ithaca is so small that it is totally run by the lunatic left employees of Cornell.</p>
<p>Wonder how the blacks of New Haven would react if the Yale employees banned Halloween?  Black kids love Halloween. </p>

		<p>From the Principal: &#8220;&lsquo;When we were young we might have been able to claim ignorance of the atrocities that Christopher Columbus committed against the indigenous peoples.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Fine, so now that she is no longer ignorant of Columbus, she can pack her bags and head back to Europe. For her to continue to live in America proves that she is a hypocrite of the highest order. She makes her living in the land of Columbus, buys her food here, drinks the water from this land, and yet belittles the ones who made it possible for her to even be alive. Columbus was an explorer during a time of conquest, and there is nothing anyone can do about it now. For those who wish to return the land to the natives, they had also better come out with the most anti-immigrant stance that is possible or again, they make themselves out to be hypocrites. Whereas we (White folks) may feel guilty enough to give back the land, the Blacks, Asians and Hispanics will hold no such belief.  The mindset of the Principal and those like her will lead to the genocide of Whites the world over, and the only way she can even take such a stand is due to the benefits of a free society, the blessing of which many fought and died for her to enjoy.</p>

		<p>Somerville Mass is one of the most radical marxist anti White racist suburbs of Boston.  A large proportion of its population is lesbian anti White marxists who are intent on pushing every bit of the radical agenda on everyone in Mass.</p>
<p>People of Somerville mostly work in the colleges around Boston, non profit radical foundations and goverment jobs such as EEOC or SBA where they can deny benefits to Whites or the local civil rights division of the Justice Department where they ceaselessly search for Whites who they can charge with civil rights violations.</p>
<p>When the black thugs from Boston rapes one of them, the ladies of Somerville go on a mad attack against the White police and District attorney&rsquo;s investigators assigned to find and arrest the black rapist.</p>
<p>A perfect liberal town, as bad as Ithaca.  </p>
<p>This town is where much of the gay marriage tactics and strategy was planned.</p>

		<p>This hatred of Thanksgiving is ridiculous.   People tend to forget all the alliances with the British and the French, and the broken treaties, or any wrongdoings done by the &#8220;native&#8221; americans.  If you want to hate on Colombus&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.go right ahead, personally I celebrate Solutrean Memorial Day along with Leif Erickson Day and still think Amerigo Vespuci may have been helped by one of my distant relatives so I light a candle in his honor as well.  I have my own personal take on the name America however, I don&rsquo;t think its&rsquo; named after Amerigo ( still light a candle ) I think it was intentioned as a modern version of Armorica the area inhabited by many mixed European tribes on the Southwestern French and Northwestern Spanish coastline.   Just my thoughts&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Halloween is not really connected to &#8220;Witchcraft.&#8221;  It is in fact a very old part of Euro-Celtic folkways and beliefs well beyond the confines of Wicca.  The Celtic new year was November 1st.  The day before was considered a sacred day when one threw off old problems and concerns.  A big bonfire was part of the celebration.  The first of November was also a time for the veneration of ancestors. It was believed that they were particularly close on this day.  The 31st of October, long before the Roman calendars, and was called &#8220;The Day of the Dead,&#8221; and was observed all over Western, Central and Eastern Europe for thousands of years.  Catholicism absorbed it and renamed it, &#8220;All Hallows Eve,&#8221; or Hallow&rsquo;een.  I have lived in a part of Europe where one October 31st many people, especially widows visit graveyards to place flowers on their loved ones graves.  They wear the very best clothes and often wail at the graves.  It is even a bit of a competition to look more well to do than your neighbor.  This is a great example of how an ancient practice was Christianized.  Puritans and Hollywood have succeeded in various misrepresentations to the point that many Western youths now imagine themselves as actual vampires and zombies.  </p>
<p>We have seen how Mexicans have arrogated this to themselves, mistaking Catholic absorbed Celtic religion as their own native idea.  This is done via white ignorance of our own cultural roots.</p>

		<p>Native Americans who are offended by Columbus should realize that the descendents of those who committed the supposed &#8220;atrocities&#8221; are not white Americans, but rather are the Mexicans and other Latinos, many of whom have some Conquistador blood, and who have since streamed into the US.<br>

		<p>This teacher is ignorant, and probably had it right as a child, not as an adult.  Brainwashing took its toll.  Columbus did not &#8220;annihilate&#8221; any people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing she&rsquo;s letting Christmas remain - though, upon reflection, I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo; already been banned from the school.  They have likely turned it into a simply winterfest instead.</p>

Once again, blacks are offended.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered how these oh so sensitive emotional suffering people with their delicate princess and the pea sensibilities kill and rape so many of their own.<br>
 <br>
PITTSBURGH (AP)   &mdash;   Some black residents of a Pittsburgh community have complained that an image of a hanged man on a billboard advertising a Halloween attraction is offensive.</p>
<p>The billboard is for the Haunted Hayloft in Somerset, about 70 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. A portion of the ad on the city&rsquo;s north side depicts a man hanging from a tree by a noose.</p>
<p>But Haunted Hayloft owner Elizabeth Svonavec says that she never meant to offend anyone and that there&rsquo;s a story behind the picture: Two white men were hanged in Somerset in 1893 for killing a farmer.</p>
<p>Svonavec says she contacted the ad agency and the billboard will be taken down, but she&rsquo;s not sure when.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the last year I have read 3 library books with nooses on the cover.  One was just a rope noose cover on a detective story where the victim was murdered but the killer tried to make it look like suicide by hanging.</p>
<p>The other book was by Robert Parker who wrote the Spenser for hire series.  That murder mystery was set in a construction company. The noose was made of orange industrial size electric cord.</p>
<p>The best book with a noose on the cover was by Christopher Buckely.  &#8220;No way to treat a lady.&#8221;  Read it someday.  Hilarious.<br>
This noose is made of a long pearl necklace.  A President dies suddenly.  After investigation his wife is indicted for murdering him.  She is innocent.  The president has the wife and 2 girl friends.  To keep all his women happy he takes viagra. One day he takes too much and gives himself a heart attack.</p>
<p>Luckily, no blacks live around here or those books would be banned.<br>

		<p>Ban Christmas (Hurons and Iroquis were clueless, and Congregationalists were against it as something &#8220;Popish&#8221;). Also- Columbus, although probably an Italian, was a Spanish navigator, and White Hispanics should be the objecting party.</p>
<p>As for Halloween, the Wiccans are among the fastest growing &#8220;religions&#8221;, so the &#8220;witchcraft&#8221; charge shouldn&rsquo;t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Introduce anything- human sacrifices, summer solstice dances, Chinese New Year, sacred prostitution a la Babylon, Nowruz, &hellip;. only (many) European Americans will be offended, but who cares ?    </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad whites are protesting such outrages, but the writer either chose a deliberately weak quote to include in the article or whites need to toughen up and use the language of the other aggrieved &#8220;minorities&#8221; in the country. </p>
<p>Whites should be &#8220;offended,&#8221; &#8220;saddened, &#8220;sickened,&#8221; etc., not merely point out that it&rsquo;s &#8220;supposed to be a free country.&#8221; This is the same kind of weak-kneed argument as &#8220;states&rsquo; rights&#8221; that failed during forced school integration. </p>
<p>By mourning the historical incident that brought Europeans to this continent, this is nothing more than a call for white self-hatred and white dispossession.</p>

		<p>Curious as those that have historically participated in these holidays have increasingly become detached from the meaning and more into the pageantry.  And yet those historically least interested are finding meanings that have long since been ignored.  <br>
Sensitivity is increasingly a way to get social position by complaining of an offense that oft is marginal at best.  Time and effort would be better spent on improving oneself and using that ambition to get a productive job.</p>

		<p>This is somewhat baffling; where is this woman coming from?</p>
<p>Why does she want to ban these Christian holidays  &mdash;  Columbus Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween?</p>
<p>I do not see an obvious distasteful thread among them, unless it is that they are &#8220;insensitive.&#8221; </p>
<p>She is probably just floating a trial balloon toward banning Christmas. Chanukkah, of course, will be untouched.</p>

		<p> Makes perfect sense to me if you are not going to offend anyone you have to cancel holidays they might offend people. This is the natural end result of excessive tolerance. The people easily offended enjoy the power they have and will continue to have until we start being equally offended by their holidays until we are so frozen by PC that nobody has any day for themselves. I like to think then we will look at each other laugh at our stupidity and restore our holidays.</p>

		<p>It never stops, does it? We all allow them to get away with it and never protest in the streets, do we? About time we started doing just that. They want to take away ALL vestiges of White European traditions, holidays, and monuments. Anything that pertains to OUR heritage and OUR history. I would love to see a huge White racial movement declaring our independence from nonwhites the world over and then deport them from all our lands. That is what it will take to get free from this insanity and to be in control of our own destiny as the Founders wanted.  </p>

Otherwise she is a hypocrite of the worst sort, enjoying the fruits of living in a land that Columbus and the Pilgrims made available to her ancestors. She wouldn&rsquo;t be here enjoying all that this land has to offer if it wasn&rsquo;t for those people.  </p>

		<p>Without a teacher&rsquo;s union, this person would be instantly fired and replaced with someone who wasn&rsquo;t a radical anti-white bigot.</p>
<p>Among a great many other positive things that everyone wants but no other politician wants to give is Ron Paul would do away with these awful unions and the department of education, giving back the freedom of communities to choose who they want educating their children and how.</p>
<p>Seriously, going over just the basics of Pauls platform, it struck me how all these things are what everyone on both sides of the aisle want, yet no one is willing to give them except him.  In a real democracy, that would mean no one else had a chance to get elected as people voted for the guy who was willing to do what they want, only.</p>
<p>Another good example is Obamacare.  Despite all the drama, Paul is the ONLY politician with any plans to repeal it. Allowing parents to die horribly so that Jose, the raping, murdering drug dealer can get dental for his ten kids, just isn&rsquo;t something people want.  So why are no other republicans foaming at the lips to get rid of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Christopher Columbus &ldquo;annihilated�? Native Americans? Where? In the USA? Christopher Columbus never set foot on what we now consider the USA.

<p>From all I have read, Columbus personally never harmed a native.  Some of his men did and were punished.  But it was disease that got the island natives.  It is no ones fault.  Those diseases came from Asia to Europe and devastated us there.  Originally, the natives came from Asia.  We had to adjust genetically.  The natives gave whites syphilis and gonorrhea which caused a great deal of suffering and death in whites and Europe until the 20th century.  Columbus&rsquo; work made the modern world possible.  Remaining in the Stone Age was not an option for us or anyone.  But this is far too intellectual for Amerinds, I suppose.</p>

		<p>These sorts of issues seem fairly cut and dry to me. If the institution is private (ex. a Catholic Parochial school) the school-board/diocese/etc. can set the tone and make whatever rules it wants for its institutions. Then, people who agree or disagree with its policies can voice their (dis)approval by electing to send their kids, or not.</p>
<p>If the institution is public (which seems to be the case here) then this school should be forced to follow state and federal mandates. Since there is no law against celebrating Columbus Day or Halloween, this principal is out of line and venting prejudice. </p>
<p>What is so hard to understand about the latitude granted to private vs. public enterprise?</p>

As for how &#8216;peaceful&rsquo; and &#8216;environmentally conscious&rsquo; they were -look no further than the bloodthirsty Aztecs, or the fact that no less than 5 major species of land animals were wiped out by the natives -all before we &#8216;corrupted&rsquo; them by stamping out blood sacrifices, ritual torture and cannabalism. <br>
As for Thanksgiving; I was always taught that that was a holiday celebrating how the Pilgrim communities co-existed with the natives -a celebration of &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; in it&rsquo;s original form&hellip;<br>
But the left&rsquo;s narritave is no longer about &#8216;diversity&rsquo; it has completed it&rsquo;s evolution into what they intended from the beginning -nothing more than a racist attack on everything white, in leading toward their overt plan of the genocide of the white race.</p>

<p>Massachuets has a long tradition of banning holidays.  The Puritans not only banned Christmas as Papist, they forbade people to cook or eat warmed up food on December 25.</p>
<p>They were afraid that people might fix a nice dinner.  So they had enforcers walking around even to the outlying farms sniffing for the smell of cooked food or God forbid, mince pies.</p>

When December 25 fell on a Sunday they cancelled Church services.</p>

#3   &mdash;   Somerville Mass is one of the most radical marxist anti-White racist suburbs of Boston.  A large proportion of its population consists of lesbian anti White marxists who are intent on pushing every bit of the radical agenda on everyone in Mass.</p>
<p>People of Somerville mostly work in the colleges around Boston, non-profit radical foundations,  and goverment jobs such as EEOC or SBA where they can deny benefits to Whites, or in the local civil rights division of the Justice Department where they ceaselessly search for Whites whom they can charge with civil rights violations.</p>
<p>When the black thugs from Boston rape one of them, the ladies of Somerville go on a mad attack against the White police and DA&rsquo;s investigators assigned to find and arrest the black rapist.</p>
<p>A perfect liberal town, as bad as Ithaca.  </p>

<p>#1  &mdash;  Ithaca, N.Y is a small town mostly occupied by employees of Cornell University a typical marxist-controlled, anti White racist Ivy League school.</p>
<p>Unlike Boston, or even Amherst, Ithaca is so small that it is totally run by the lunatic left employees of Cornell.</p>
<p>=============================</p>
<p>How interesting!  That casts an interesting light on it. I know Ithaca, but not Somerville.  Ithaca is  full of radicals, essentially up from NYC (not locals), just as Somerville is full of Boston&rsquo;s radicals. Radical chic rules in these unlikely places.  (They are much more than merely &#8220;liberal&#8221; btw.) </p>
<p>I recently read that Syracuse U. is he #1 most radical university in the USA. What&rsquo;s notable is that both Syracuse U. And Ithaca  Cornell U.  (Ithaca)   are located in very white parts of the state  (once entirely white), and quite conservative.  These are islands of radicalism and color in a white sea.   These seething black and Jewish radicals from NYC (and elsewhere) go there   &mdash;   on state-provided scholarships   &mdash;   to live in a nice, safe, wholesome area where they can hate and despise all the white people around them and plot for their demise   &mdash;  -  all the while enjoying the comforts of the good life that these white people provide.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that typical?  They always bite the hand that feeds them.</p>

<p>When Howard Zinn writes, inspires or influences the majority of the textbooks used in American history classes, where  <i>white men are always to blame</i> </p>
<p>Zinn:</p>
<p><i>Is it right to take down the traditional heroes of the nation, like Christopher Columbus, Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt? Is it unpatriotic to emphasize slavery and racism, the massacres of Indians, the exploitation of the working people? Why should we think it heroic to do as Columbus did, arrive in this hemisphere and carry on a rampage of violence, in order to find gold?</i></p>
<p><i>New versions of his book have come out in comic-book form, for teens who have limited critical reading skills or limited attention spans, as well as a multi-volume set rewritten for upper-elementary and middle-school students.</i></p>
<p>And the Marxist teacher training policies of Ayers have taken over in schools of education, indoctrinating America&rsquo;s future teachers in the revolutionary cause and urging them to pass on the lessons to their public school students</p>
<p>Or as Ayers puts it in one of his course descriptions:  <i>prospective K–12 teachers need to be aware of the social and moral universe we inhabit and &hellip; be a teacher capable of hope and struggle, outrage and action, a teacher teaching for social justice and liberation.</i></p>
<p>It is no wonder that traditional White holidays, traditions, values and heroes are being banned in the schools.  Whites history is being assigned to Orwell&rsquo;s Memory Hole, soon along with the Whites that created that history.  </p>

		<p>God, these liberals and anti-white minority dimwits have nothing better to do. They&rsquo;re kids for god sakes!  It&rsquo;s a time for them to dress in costumes and get candy.  Do we need to know the historical significance behind every holidy we celebrate or every word we use or every product or service we buy?  Really?  This is another reason for everyone (especially whites) to homeschool our kids.</p>

		<p>Anon. #3: There is agroup called Mass Resistance that is engaged in fighting the Gay-Lesbian-Other agenda being implemented in Schools, particularly when it is aimed at Kindergarten children.</p>
<p>Their web site is worth viewing, and their Organization is worthy of your support. </p>

		<p>Poster #47 has a great idea, and a wonderful one-liner to fire back at the darkies who are offended that we have a culture and history of our own. I think whites not only need to start saying that to our racial enemies, but to start backing those mile high words with action appropriate to the circumstances.</p>

		<p>History is history we should still be celebrating Christopher Columbus day! <br>
We celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr. Day - The man BEAT his own wife - King was a drunk, plagiarist, bisexual, and Marxist. Try to remember that we are not concerned with his race or complexion, but his character.  </p>
<p>AND we celebrate him! I think every person has a bad side and a good side. SO we should keep celebrating Christopher Columbus. </p>
<p>I am just so tired of all the liberal stuff.</p>
<p>RON PAUL 2012! Enough is enough! </p>
