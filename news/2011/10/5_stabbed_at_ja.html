			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Teresa Masterson, NBC Philadelphia, October 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A welcome home party for a teen released from juvenile detention resulted in gunshots and stab wounds for five people at the party.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reports of gunshots in that area brought police to find two people with stab wounds from a huge brawl that erupted on the street during the party. Police brought the two wounded to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and later discovered that three more people were stabbed and had gone to the hospital on their own.</p>
<p>Four adults and one 17-year-old juvenile were among the wounded, reports the Morning Call.\</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police told the Morning Call that the cause for the fight was unknown and the guest of honor was not among the wounded or detained.</p>

		<p>Well, we all know it&rsquo;s not a successful &#8216;Welcome Home from Juvie Party&rsquo;, unless the Guest of Honor is among the &#8216;wounded or detained&rsquo;.</p>
<p>So, I gotta say, FAIL!</p>

		<p>If I had a close relative in jail or prison, I wouldn&rsquo;t throw him a &#8220;getting out of jail/prison party.&#8221;  Two main reasons:</p>
<p>1.  I would be embarrassed to advertise so loudly that I have a relative that was in prison.</p>
<p>2.  Getting out of jail or prison is not an accomplishment worthy of a party.  Getting out of the joint per your prescribed bid because you didn&rsquo;t screw up badly enough while in the hoosegow isn&rsquo;t something to be proud of, it&rsquo;s a minimum expectation of behavior.  It&rsquo;s like lauding professional athletes for &#8220;playing hard.&#8221;  Duh, they&rsquo;re professional athletes, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re supposed to do.  You laud them for winning.</p>
<p>See, there I go again, being all racist and stuff with my developed frontal lobe.</p>
<p>Actually, I once lived next door to a gang full of white hoosiers (St. Louis definition) who threw a party for one of theirs who had gotten out after doing 15 of a 20 bid for Murder Two.  And it got out of hand, predictably.  (Later, I heard the man of the house pimped out his then underage daughter to the &#8220;guest of honor.&#8221;)  </p>
<p>That would be a good acid test for people who want to be around and live around, and people you don&rsquo;t, or to determine who is and is not &#8220;the wrong crowd,&#8221; regardless of race   &mdash;   If the person would throw or host a &#8220;get out of jail&#8221; party or even attend one, avoid like the plague.  If not, then s/he is probably civil.</p>

		<p>Reports of raceless violence are your signal from MSM, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Obama-Holder-Ogletree DOJ to keep your mouth shut and never ask any racist questions such as, &#8220;Were these Whitey frat boys who drank too much beer and started shoot&rsquo;n and stab&rsquo;n errey&rsquo;body up &#8216;en he&rsquo;ah?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever wondered why you never see a bad news story about a member of the CFR? Why so many of them are given Pulitzer Prizes, and are known for the rest of their lives as some sort of royal &#8220;Pulitzer Prize-winning so and so&#8221;?     Look up the Pulitzer website and you can see who the names are that made the awards each year. They are the hostile elite who maintains a firm ethnocentrism for themselves while harshly and effectively condemning us for trying to do the same thing.   Deception and tyranny, thou are the CFR.</p>
<p>Say your prayers in secret for God&rsquo;s blessing and preservation of what little White privilege you have left, because you know that somebody who hates you knows you&rsquo;ve still got some of it, and they are planning to &#8220;unburden&#8221; you from it as soon as possible.</p>

		<p>I read the original article. What struck me was that Amren would not have allowed most of the comments to be posted. That said, I only hope the housing is not Section 8 in some nice suburb. </p>

		<p>As much as we like to knock Philly, this occurred in Bethlehem, 70 miles north of the city. The Lehigh Valley Metro area, including Bethlehem,  Allentown and Easton, gets all the black and Hispanic thugs from NYC and Philadelphia coming in to bless the largely PA Dutch indigenes with diversity, peace be unto it. South Bethlehem has been a Hispanic no go zone for several years now.</p>
<p>And the third world is creeping into the townships. Just the other day, there was a shooting outside of a walmart several miles north into white country from Atown. Same MO of mindless violence by the usual suspects. I live in Philly now for work, and I expect the savagery here. But it breaks my heart to see what my pretty little valley of hilly farmland, hex signs, and general quirkiness has become.</p>

		<p>Why would I have a party to &#8220;celebrate&#8221; a relative getting out of prison? YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO GO TO PRISON! I would be humiliated and ashamed if one of my family members was in prison and I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t want to advertise that fact to the world. And anyways what has been accomplished? Nothing. This is not a celebration of graduating college or opening a new business. The guy has just completed his sentence. Hardly an accomplishment in my view. The mentality of a certain sub-set of the population just defies belief.</p>

		<p>Here are your perps. As Archie Bunker once said, PR&rsquo;s use knives.</p>
<p>http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-bethlehem-street-fight-20111017,0,7150430.story</p>
<p>A welcome home party in south Bethlehem for a teen recently released from juvenile detention turned into a large street fight that left five people with stab wounds, police said.</p>
<p>Bethlehem police responded to the 500 block of Hess Street around 11 p.m. Saturday after receiving reports of gunshots in the neighborhood. Police found two people with stab wounds and took them to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital-Fountain Hill.</p>
<p>Three other people with knife wounds went to the hospital on their own.</p>
<p>An initial report from police said the party was in honor of a person released from a correctional facility, but it did not indicate the person was a juvenile.</p>
<p>Police said David M. Torres, 22, Gabriel Soto, 20, and Darren Linton, 21, all of Bethlehem, were admitted to the hospital. Torres&rsquo; twin brother Michael and a 17-year-old juvenile were treated and released, police said.</p>
<p>Lt. Mark DiLuzio said five people, including a woman who is suspected of firing the weapon, were detained by police and later released.</p>

		<p>Question Diversity- You have a profound point when talking about a developed frontal lobe. There seems to be a faction w/in the psychiatric field about psychopathy and sociopathy. There are many overlapping characteristics but the basic idea is that psychopaths are born that way and sociopaths are raised in an environment of severe and extreme dysfunction and anti-social surroundings. There is a part of the brain called the amygdala that controls emotions like empathy and compassion. These characteristics are almost nonexistent within psychopaths and sociopaths. </p>
<p>One of the many traits of psychopathy is failure to learn from past mistakes. This probably explains high recividism amongst convicts. Idon&rsquo;t pretend to be a medical doctor, but if the common belief from the left were true, that poverty and abuse cause crime, then it is all the more reason to avoid a considerable percentage of blacks because there is no known cure or treatment for psychopathy. And if you are ever an unfortunate victim of criminal acts from a psychopath, black, White or whatever shade, don&rsquo;t expect a truthful sincere apology. It&rsquo;s not in their genetic code. Why is it so hard for lefties to accept that different racial makeups could have different brains? Now if you&rsquo;ve googled infamous murderers, sadly many of them White, they had high IQs. But they had no caring whatsoever for their fellow men and women. Since there are far more street criminals in the system, and countless mugshots you can see the cold blank dark stares from the black variety just as easy as the stares from the worst of the worst amongst the Whites. So no one ever wants to talk about the abominable and utterly horrific upbringing of the White monsters. Only the black ones? Where is the logic?</p>

		<p>For blacks, a prison sentence is the equivalent of a &#8220;college degree&#8221; for whites or asians.<br>
Blacks establish their &#8220;street cred(ibility)&#8221; with a prison sentence and celebrate the &#8220;graduation&#8221; with violence.<br>
Such is ingrained in black DNA &hellip;</p>
