			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CBS New York, October 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Halloween display at a home in Brooklyn has been taken down after some called it a symbol of racism.</p>
<p>A scarecrow painted to have dark skin was hanging by a rope from a tree in front of a home in Kensington.</p>
<p>Some neighbors say the homeowner gets in the spirit of Halloween every year and believe he meant no harm by the display.</p>
<p>But one councilman argued it was reminiscent of a lynching.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police settled the dispute by removing the scarecrow figure from the tree.</p>

		<p>So, then, a man who has admittedly broken no law has his Halloween decoration removed by police, because of the hysterical whines of his (presumably African) neighbors.</p>

		<p>&#8220;reminiscent of a lynching&hellip;&#8221; Yeah&hellip;. So what?!?! It`s Halloween!! You mean to tell me that dressing as a sadistic Eastern European count who sucks the blood from narcoleptic virginal females and makes them his undead sexual slaves sets the standard but a dead guy hanging from a tree causes offense?!? Or&hellip; Dressing as an Alien from Alpha Centauri bent on conquering the world is okay but parodying an Alien from South of the Border invading Arizona  is demeaning? Hmmm&hellip; Color me Old School. I`ll now and forever view Arabs in Bedouin garb as nothing more than the conninving  villians in an Abbot and Costello Meet The Mummy movie&hellip;Ask your self folks, WWSDD? &#8220;What Would Scooby Doo Do?&#8221;  One night a year can we please be greeted with &#8220;Boo!&#8221; and NOT Boo Hoo Ho? </p>

		<p>This was taking of private property for a public purpose without just compensation.  I don&rsquo;t think there was just compensation, much less any compensation, because we&rsquo;re not told that there was.</p>

<p>Have some Pacific Rim sweatshop produce miniature nooses from jute or sisal for marketing in the US. Then all of us &#8220;haterz&#8221; can discretely sprinkle them all over the place.</p>

<p>As to his Halloween Decoration, since when do the &#8220;police&#8221; have a Right to dictate what you can or cannot do to your own Property?</p>

		<p>Well of course it&rsquo; &#8220;racist&#8221;&hellip; because as we all know blacks are the only ones in history to have ever been hanged.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer, nor do I smell like one, or even play one on TV, but unless we&rsquo;ve just become a black police state, I would think it would be illegal for cops to remove anything (that wasn&rsquo;t physically harming someone, e.g. an IED or a .50 cal. nest), from your property.</p>
<p>I also guarantee that if it had a white face, nothing would have happened.</p>
<p>I can also guarantee that, had this been a black couple&rsquo;s house, no matter WHAT color the scarecrow was, nothing would have happened.</p>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s been taken down by the Regime, what will happen when all the crows show up, b/c there&rsquo;s no scarecrow there? After all, crows are BLACK. THEN what will the Gestapo do? What a quandary!</p>

		<p>The police should of sent city workers over to paint the scarecrow white, at tax payers expense. Then sent the owner the bill. If the owner did pay the bill, evict them and turn the empty house into a neighborhood crack house.</p>

		<p>I remember several Halloweens back when some snot nosed punk hung a effigy of Sara Palin by the neck from his porch. This was an exact death threat against a particular person, not a generic scare crow used as a Halloween decoration like in the above article. Yet the cops did nothing in this case and had a good laugh and all but gave this punk a commendation for doing such a fine job and never made the hate monger take it down. So it&rsquo;s easy to see that the Police in this nation are Gestapo Agents for the left wing liberal commie pigs that mean to drag this nation down at any cost including breaking the law to do it. Francis Piven would be proud!</p>

		<p>This councilman, Charles Barron, is a rabid anti-White racist to the core. That this Black Supremacist remains in office is itself a sign of how far our people have fallen. This is all about Black power and NOTHING else, make no mistake about it! </p>

		<p>When one airline took over another, dissolving the union of the smaller airline, a pilot belonging to the dissolved union expressed his anger by leaving a doll with a noose around its neck hanging in the cockpit for the next flight crew to find and remove. The left-wing media spun the story as a display of racial hatred, despite the fact that the doll was white, and even interviewed a member of the ground crew who said he was offended by what the pilot did. </p>
<p>Soon the public display of nooses will be an automatic hate-crime charge. The person&rsquo;s intent will be irrelevant. </p>

		<p>#19: I read the last line of your post, which made me think about the Televison Show, &#8220;The Addams Family&#8221;. </p>
<p>I recall seeing Gomez or Morticia pulling on a noose that rang some type of Gong, which shook the house, and called their Butler, Lurch. </p>
<p>But that was back before the country had a stick up its rear. I could just see that Show being banned, today. </p>
<p>Yes, life was good back then, and even television shows were fun. </p>
