<h1>600 Tunisians Flown Home from Italy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Google News, October 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Six hundred Tunisian illegal immigrants who arrived in Italy by boat have been deported in a week, the interior ministry announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>They were put on several flights from Palermo, Sicily, under an agreement signed on April 5 between Tunis and Rome arranging the systematic deportation of Tunisians arriving illegally.</p>
<p>The flood of immigrants from Tunisia had dried up immediately after the accord but recently resumed.</p>

		<p>I would venture a guess that many will reattempt to enter the West, using more stealthy means. </p>
<p>The Italians should have taken fingerprints and iris scans to identify repeat offenders.</p>

		<p>Finally a solution to our beoken immigration situation. We will return all illegals to their countries of origin and in return we will accept back any Americans who may have illegally entered their countries.</p>
<p>Sounds fair to me.</p>

		<p>They should simply use the army to deport these invaders, and not just in Italy but everywhere. The problem will be gone in a flash.</p>

		<p>I am happy.<br/>
Some good news.<br/>
A drop in the bucket, but good news.<br/>
In this messed up world, it takes a strong white culture, made first of strong white men and women, as INDIVIDUALS, to turn the tide, if it be one drop at a time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s praise the Italians, and start catapulting Mestizos southward!</p>

		<p>Good for Italy. Keep it up. Once people see you mean business, they will stop trying to take advantage of you. I would suggest the deportees be fingerprinted to identify any repeat offenders and to punish them.</p>

		<p>That is heart warming news. Well done Italy.</p>
<p>This is the very moment Tunisia needs it&rsquo;s healthy young people. They are needed to nation build. If all the people who are fit and ambitious are allowed to just leave then Tunisia will never develop.</p>
<p>Imagine if the French who fought for the republic emigrated instead of dealing with their tyrant royalty. France would not have developed.</p>
<p>There should be no fit healthy refugees. Refugees should only be the old and sick.</p>

		<p>I ask, WHY would there be any LEGAL Tunisians in Italy, they would be muslims and muslims should NOT be in Italy, they are nothing but trouble and Italy has enough trouble from their capitol city of Brussels!</p>

		<p>Why hasn&rsquo;t anyone in this country(are you listening, Mr. President?) got the courage to go on worldwide TV and announce to the rest of the world that the US is no longer its dumping ground. Make a firm statement that we are demanding illegals leave and if there are any complaints from the &#8220;home&#8221; countries, all financial aid immediately ceases. Then, do an Eisenhower and tell illegals to leave or face jail time. If families are &#8220;broken up&#8221; - which is their own fault - than they can reunite in the country they came from and anchor babies are free to go. Do you know the billions of dollars we&rsquo;d save? Then put military on the border. After that, put a moratorium on all immigration for ten years. That should be a good start. Any anti-American organization who would star whining, such as La Raza, can be reminded that we have dozens of ag visas, legal immigrants, visa lottery winners, etc. already here (some throught ridiculous laws) that need jobs and most of all, we have millions of unemployed Americans who&rsquo;d love to work.</p>

		<p>This is a good start, but if Italy wants to stop the endless cycle of illegal immigrant invasions, it should also forcibly patrol the Tunisian coast, or at least threaten Tunisia to comply with stopping the outflow of its people. The Italian Navy is certainly strong enough to force Tunisia to concede.</p>
