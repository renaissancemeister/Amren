			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Flynn, Sun (London), October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A shady boss running a one-stop shop for illegal immigrants is today exposed by The Sun.</p>
<p>Bhavin Shah boasts that he can smuggle people into the UK, arrange weddings to keep them here and sort no-show college places so they can pose as students while working full-time.</p>
<p>And he insisted: &#8220;If you want to bring someone from India here, I can get a man from India for £3,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Sun investigator posed as a construction boss needing to keep his illegal staff in the UK with sham marriages and dodgy student visas.</p>
<p>Shah assured him: &#8220;We can help you out. Everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bragged how he rakes in thousands charging illegals for help to enter the UK. He also makes a fortune from dodgy British bosses keen to wangle student visas to keep staff here.</p>
<p><strong>Visa</strong></p>
<p>We met Shah at a second-floor office with its own reception in Wembley, North West London.</p>
<p>He was unaware he was secretly being filmed as he told how he charges £4,750 to arrange enrolment and a two-and-a-half year visa  &mdash;  with a discount for bulk.</p>
<p>Shah showed us a website of a London IT and management college licensed by the UK Border Agency where our &#8220;staff&#8221; would be enrolled.</p>
<p>He laughed that they would only have to attend college once &#8220;to see the place&#8221; and &#8220;know the address&#8221;.</p>
<p>And when told our fictional workers didn&rsquo;t speak English he said: &#8220;I&rsquo;ll sort out the English language pass certificate for your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said he offered a £12,000 service providing fake brides and sham marriages to help illegals stay here.</p>
<p>He added that he could also arrange to smuggle in people  &mdash;  suggesting we could charge them more than he was asking and then take a cut.</p>
<p>Shah said: &#8220;I charge £3,000 from people in Punjab and you add your amount on top.&#8221;</p>
<p>At another meeting, he showed off a book of 1,600 clients signed on as students since January. Asked how many were working instead of studying, he replied: &#8220;Every one.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he could supply backdated certificates for Government-accredited colleges confirming &#8220;students&#8221; had attended classes, even if they hadn&rsquo;t, so they could get visa extensions.</p>
<p>Shah revealed he could arrange for an illegal to marry a Polish girl brought here by him.</p>
<p>Asked if he provided the wedding too, he said: &#8220;Yes, that&rsquo;s our job.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he had been doing it for 12 years.</p>
<p>Our dossier is available to police.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Salesmen&rsquo; find a thing to sell, and then sell it.</p>
<p>Selling citizenship in white countries is a lucrative trade, with an abundant supply of &#8216;buyers&rsquo; numbering in the billions.</p>
<p>No wonder so many entrepreneurs are getting in on the bonanza.</p>

		<p>A lot of nonsense is regularly talked on WN sites about ethnic IQs.<br>
 I&rsquo;ve said this before and I&rsquo;ll say it again, in general subcon Indians have a natural guile, cunning and mental deftness that is second to none - and they seem very adept to mentally tie in knots the big, fat, fatheaded idiots who seem to run the civil services and governments of western nations, and run rings around them.In a contest between the smart and guileful and PC brainwashed idiots, the smart and guileful will win every time.<br>
    This subcon Indian is merely taking advantage of deliberate policies introduced by Britain&rsquo;s god-awful failed New Labour government.Basicall, New Labour (having deindustrilaised Britain), thought that &#8216;education&rsquo; would be an &#8216;ivisible export&rsquo; and &#8216;money spinner&rsquo;, so relaxed controls on immigrants purporting to be students as muh as possible, to get what they thought was fee income - notwithstanding the fact that India possesses thousands of educational institutions that are no doubt cheaper and better.<br>
  So what Labour gave us was Indians scamming the system as another route of mass immigration, on a massive scale.</p>

		<p>The sucker Brits can&rsquo;t seem to figure out that their corrupt sell-out politician don&rsquo;t work for them and have deliberately let this easy illegal migration to the the UK occur to keep them in power while the native Brits pay for it in many bad ways. They desperately need to elect a right wing party but are too stupidly afraid of being called &#8220;racists&#8221; - a standard method of control.<br>
See <br>

<p>We have similar sellouts among our congressional population, but probably not as bad as the sucker Brits who let their political power get stolen away by the EU political elite class.</p>

		<p>I went to the link in 3 and read through the article and then through the comments.</p>
<p>One comment from Sweden says it all. Much of what the writer says can be applied to what we are experiencing in our own country and the way most of us probably feel. Frustration and rage. Fear for the future of our own children. I hope its alright to do this, I&rsquo;m posting it here with full credit to the poster as it originally appeared:</p>
<p>&#8216;I am speechless! Having read this article I am also feeling sick to my stomach. I emigrated six years ago to Sweden in the hope of a better life away from NuLabour and their systematic destruction of the UK with their &#8220;open borders&#8221;, &#8220;justice for criminals&#8221;, dumbing down of education&#8221; &#8220;pc gone mad&#8221; policies. Sadly, much of the same is happening here in Sweden. We, the people have a voice - why are we not using it!?! I fear for the world my son will inherit when its a crime to be patriotic, to love your country and to question why a small island is allowing such unchecked immigration when it cannot adequately meet the needs of its already high numbers of citizens. Truly truly shameful that a Govt has been allowed to do this. Get out of Europe, get rid of this Govt and put the Great back into Britain. Sweden - take note.</p>

<p>No comment from Sureesh arguing that these illegal, non-English-speaking Indians will actually be a huge benefit to Britain because Indians are so much smarter than white people?</p>
