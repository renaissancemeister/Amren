			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), October 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Prime Minister pledges to bring net immigration down to &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; while conceding it has had a positive benefit to society.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister set out the new plans on immigration in a speech in London, while saying &#8220;some immigration is a good thing&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the same way that many British people take advantage of opportunities to work, study and live overseas many of our communities have been enriched by the contribution of generations of migrants,&#8221; said Mr Cameron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our schools and universities have some of the best teachers, researchers and students from all over the world and we&rsquo;re proud of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our hospitals are full of talented doctors and nurses caring for the sick and vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our high streets are home to entrepreneurs who are not just adding to the local economy but playing a part in local life.</p>
<p>He also said that Britain would always be open to those seeking asylum from persecution.</p>
<p>The party has pledged to bring net immigration down to &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; but the Coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats has meant that promise is not formal Government policy.</p>

		<p>If America was as crowded as England its population would be 3,650,000,000 rather then its actual 312,000,000. The last thing England needs is more people - ANY people. And to bring in racially and culturally alien people is even crazier.</p>

		<p>Problem is, 1980s immigration levels into the UK were pretty high.  Margaret Thatcher actually encouraged Muslim immigration, she loved the &#8220;family values&#8221; they supposedly brought.  (Sound familiar)?  She probably never said that family values stop at the English Channel, though.</p>
<p>If David CaMORON actually does this, I&rsquo;ll be surprised.  I think this is all an attempt to keep members of his own party from defecting.  I read today that some Lord Daddy Warbucks just defected from the Tories to UKIP   &mdash;   That&rsquo;s a start, but he should have gone to the BNP. </p>

		<p>What idiocy. Same ole speeches that mean absolutely nothing to the survival of White Britain.  Cameron is as liberal as they come and loves diversity. The only way Britain will survive is to rid Britain of all nonwhites, period. The same goes for all European nations and the USA. But we all know most Whites don&rsquo;t have enough sense or courage to do that, don&rsquo;t we?  </p>
<p>He also said that Britain would always be open to those seeking asylum from persecution.</p>
<p>Well we all know what that means. Hundreds of thousand more nonwhite &#8220;refugees&#8221;&hellip;to &#8220;replace&#8221; all those &#8220;lost&#8221;, immigrants.</p>
<p>The whole White world is doomed and no one seems to do anything about it, except talk, and talk some more and deny, and deny some more.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a scam! Note the 2nd last paragraph, in translation: Educated White immigrants from Poland (who take all the good jobs from UK Muslims) will be halted BUT the uneducated Black, Brown &amp; Yellow 3rdWorld &#8216;refugee&rsquo; hoards will be coming in at 1980s levels which will overwhelm the Native Brits who have practically no birthrate and are left without any more fecund educated White Poles to balance things out racially. </p>

		<p>This is hollow rhetoric. Cameron is a pro-EU, pro-mass immigration and pro-diversity liberal masquerading as a conservative. He won&rsquo;t actually implement this, and concoct some excuse as to why this is the case. Voting for the BNP is the only option. </p>

<p>Yep, and all we hear from the Republicans is how great Thatcher and Reagan were&hellip;She encouraged Muslim immigration and Reagan legalized millions of illegals. Good going you race traitors.</p>
<p>All I hear on our local &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show is what great &#8220;family values&#8221; our mexican &#8220;immigrants&#8221; have and how conservative the &#8220;matriarch&#8221; of the family is&hellip;man, do they think we are stupid.</p>

		<p>It will take war to free the English people from the invaders.  Unfortunately the genetic flotsam will remain long after the bulk of the invaders have been repulsed (you know, all those mixed race children and the little communities of color that will never leave the island).</p>

		<p>Wow, what a worm this man is. A worm with a very brown nose&hellip;apologizing and gushing lies, just to pad the way for a paltry gesture to avoid the anihilation of Britain.</p>
<p>BUT, this twit notwithstanding, it is a small step in the right direction. Notice the twit did say getting immigration right meant getting the &#8220;&hellip;right people&hellip;&#8221; <br>
It&rsquo;s a tepid start, but we see how the Marxists are backpedalling so fast&hellip;yet they are still going to fall, and HARD. They won&rsquo;t be getting up, either.<br>
So be determined, white men and women, don&rsquo;t wallow in defeatism.<br>

		<p>This is the same man who campaigned on the ticket that they would have a national referendum on being in the EU.  It was as his predecessor Gordon (Crash Gordon) Brown also promised, a blatant lie.  They are all hoping for well paid non-jobs in Brussels when they &#8220;retire&#8221; so will not upset the cart now.</p>
<p>To date only the BNP has told the truth and this fact has and still is being proven.</p>

		<p>There is an old Thanksgiving joke that goes:</p>
<p>How do you keep a Turkey in suspense? I&rsquo;ll tell you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Politicians always promise to do something &#8220;tomorrow&#8221;. They&rsquo;re just treating the voters like Turkeys. If politicians intended to do something they would do it today. They just want to pacify voters while continuing to do what they darn well please. Any vote for the LibLabCon is a wasted vote.</p>

		<p><i>The Prime Minister pledges to bring net immigration down.. while conceding it has had a positive benefit to society&hellip;many of our communities have been enriched by the contributions of migrants&rsquo;</i> </p>
<p>May we have an example of one positive benefit migrants have brought to  British society, Mr. Cameron.</p>
<p>By &#8220;enriched&#8221;, Mr. Cameron, I assume you mean such things as increased rape, murder, mayhem and massive welfare use black and Asian Third World baby factories have &#8220;contributed&#8221; to England.</p>
<p><i>He also said that Britain would always be open to those seeking asylum from persecution.&gt;</i></p>
<p>I assume this includes Brandon Huntley, Mr. Cameron, a white refugee fleeing the murderous black hell state your traitorous predecessors helped to enact in SA resulting in the genocide of whites.</p>
<p>Mr. Cameron, you are cut from the same cloth as Messrs. Brown, Blair and Gordon, all of you bent on replacing the native born white British population with fecund welfare cases from the most depraved parts of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.  </p>
<p>Soon, Britain will be majority non-white, erasing what&rsquo;s left of 1,000 years of British Common Law;  the current police state (ushered in by Mrs. Thatcher) replaced by totalitarian Muslim Sharia Law, with any remaining white kulaks killed off.</p>
<p>Nice going, Mr. Cameron, and Cheers!</p>
<p>I cannot print here what I&rsquo;d like to do you and others foolish elites of your ilk because of what you&rsquo;ve done to the white British homeland.  Let&rsquo;s say it has to do with a certain part of your body posted on a stake along the Thames River for all to see.</p>

		<p>Fred #12: Politicians are great for promising things will get better &#8220;tomorrow&#8221;, but we need to remind them of something I heard years ago: &#8220;Tomorrow never comes, because when it does, it is always today&#8221;. </p>
<p>They better get off their duffs and do something, because instead of &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221;, the Brits can have their own version called, &#8220;Occupy Downing Street&#8221; until they do. </p>

<p>One reason, I think, is because the USA, Canada, and Australia still have very low population densities, and immigration is less noticeable to most people. Countries like Britain and the Netherlands, with a very high population density, are more sensitive to immigration and are more likely to try to bring the levels down.</p>

		<p>Talk is cheap<br>
Cameron is trying to save his job.<br>
The masses are starting to wake up and unless the Conservatives-Liberal Democrats and Labour start doing something the voters are going to go somewhere else.<br>
He talks about ending &#8220;mass&#8221; immigration but continuing with &#8220;good&#8221; immigration but does not spell out what these terms mean.<br>
Does &#8216;good&#8221; immigration mean letting in a young IT whiz kid from Asia, or does it mean admitting a an adult dispossessed white Rhodesian farmer who was once a British subject and whose father probably fought to save Britain from Hitler during WWII? </p>

		<p>Nicolas Sarkozy is apparently angry with David Cameron for always telling him what to do but ignoring that advice himself, as if it didn&rsquo;t apply to him. We in Britain get this from Cameron all the time! </p>
