			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead and Christopher Hope, Telegraph (London), October 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bernard Hogan-Howe, the new Metropolitan Commissioner, said as many as one in 10 staff at inspector rank or above could be parachuted in.</p>
<p>He said women and those from ethnic minorities have achieved &#8220;far more and far more quickly&#8221; in other industries and indicated they should now be targeted and fast-tracked to make senior police ranks more representative.</p>
<p>High-flying police officers could also be allowed to leapfrog ranks to get to the top quicker, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Hogan-Howe also said that he is in talks with the Home Office and Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, in a bid to protect the Met from budget cuts before next year&rsquo;s Olympics.</p>
<p>He repeated his pledge of a &#8220;total war&#8221; on crime and warned drug dealers to expect to have their &#8220;doors put in&#8221;.</p>
<p>The police have long been criticised for a poor representation of women and ethnic minorities, and moves to boost diversity have often fallen short of targets.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Police Review magazine, published today, Mr Hogan-Howe suggested proposals to shake up traditional entry levels for the police could be used to improve diversity.</p>
<p>They would be brought in above the rank of constable and undergo fast-track training. He said: &#8220;I think there is some option for some of the people selected at middle and senior management to come from outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might take 10 per cent who, after two to three years&rsquo; training, are up to strength, and have an open mind about whether it is at inspector rank or superintendent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if such a move would help diversity, he added: &#8220;I think so because, if you look at certain areas of society, women and black and ethnic minorities are over-represented. If you look at graduates, there are more women than men.</p>
<p>&#8220;In certain industries, women and ethnic minorities have achieved far more and far more quickly than in the police.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are recruiting from that pool, we will have a lot more chance of being more representative of society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Hogan-Howe disclosed that negotiations were under way to ensure that Met numbers were not hit before the 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p>Police forces are facing budget cuts of up to 20 per cent over the next four years with the heaviest falling in the first two years.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;We are in discussions with Boris Johnson and Kit Malthouse, of the Metropolitan Police Authority, who are talking with the Home Office to see if we can maintain our police numbers for a longer period.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Every single Black &amp; Ethnic-Minority police officer in the UK has a grudge against white society; every last one expects rapid promotion and anyone who fails to fast-track them is a racist white supremacist.</p>
<p>The mere hint that a police officer is a &#8220;racist&#8221; is an automatic career-killer.</p>
<p>It is understood by all that Muslim police officers cannot be trusted to investigate the grooming of underage white girls by British-born Pakistanis, Bengalis, Kurds and Turkish Cypriots; evidence is somehow &#8220;lost&#8221; and witnesses are intimidated.</p>
<p>Dear reader, please check the British National Party website from time to time.</p>

		<p>Wow.<br>
We&rsquo;re&#8221; waging a total war on crime&hellip;&#8221;<br>
While slamming the diversity machine into overdrive, hiring more ultra-corrupt and incompetent third world brown people!<br>
I&rsquo;m just going to sit back and have a little laugh right now.<br>
Well, be of good cheer; these are the LAST days of multiculturalism; they may be replaced by outright race war in the economic collapse, but the days of these white traitors are over, soon.  They&rsquo;ll be taken out by the browns they hire.<br>

Don&rsquo;t forget to include the racists. We must be allowed to sleep in our beds of a night, knowing the next door racist is being watched. </p>

		<p>Some US readers seem think our young fellow-citizens of colour use only cutlery for their street fun and transfers of wealth in Britain; in fact, guns are here with a vengeance.<br>
The old complaint about our - now multi-coloured - men in blue -&#8220;You only stopped and searched de car coz you is raysis&#8221; - used to be known as &#8220;drivin&rsquo; while black&#8221;.  &#8220;Stabbin&rsquo; and shootin&rsquo; while black&#8221; hasn&rsquo;t quite the same charm.</p>

		<p>Ever heard of Heather Fong the first women police chief of San Francisco?  Her qualifications were lesbian, female, non White.</p>
<p>She was a reasonable desk officer at Lieutenant&rsquo;s level.  She couldn&rsquo;t shoot.  She did abysmally on the range.  She was also about 20 pounds underweight from the beginning.</p>
<p>15 pounds underweight is still a lot better than the 75 pound overweight affirmative action hispanic cops I see in California.</p>
<p>The police in England are not allowed to move against the criminal classes because the criminal classes are black and mistakenly labeled asian.</p>
<p>I doubt it matters any more who is hired, a functional capable White man or a female non White.  Neither are permitted to do their job.</p>

<p>That should destroy what little morale is left in <i>that</i> department in no time. At my old department, the incompetents of any race screwed things up so badly that the brass finally made it policy that you needed three years street experience before you could take you first promotional exam. </p>

		<p>Considering that it seems that most crime in britain is committed by &#8216;minorities&rsquo; and low class whites who emulate them, you would think they would keep the force middle class white so someone honest would be around.</p>
