<h1>D.C. Occupiers Convene, Plot to Stay the Winter</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Samantha Gilman, Washington Examiner, October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}  </p>
<p>The Occupy D.C. protesters at McPherson Square gathered for their nightly general assembly to review the guidelines, discuss logistics, and hear suggestions from members of the tent community that has sprung up on National Park Service land.</p>
<p>{snip} The agenda included a brief welcome, a reading of guidelines, a review of their unique voting process, committee reports, a &#8220;de-escalation&#8221; brainstorm, and announcements.</p>
<p>{snip} Guideline number 10 reads, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t assume gender.  When possible, go with gender-neutral pronouns.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After the committee announcements, the protesters brainstormed ideas for a prospective &#8220;de-escalation committee&#8221;  &mdash;  whose purpose would be to maintain the movement&rsquo;s non-violence. {snip}</p>
<p>Protesters agreed that the de-escalation committee would seek non-violent methods to protest.  They requested that the committee be diverse and specifically discouraged too much participation by white heterosexual males.</p>
<p>During the final session reserved for comments, discussions became somewhat heated when a man stood and said through the &#8220;human mic,&#8221; &#8220;We are all God&rsquo;s children. We should not label each other.&#8221;  Another man responded, &#8220;Issues of inequality should be at the center of discussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>A woman added, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t mention God.  It makes me feel like I have to hide my agnostic beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>By 7:00 p.m. the meeting was adjourned, and protesters slowly dispersed.</p>

		<p>Their &#8216;diversity&rsquo; is so unstable that any small push can get them at each other&rsquo;s throats.  This is what they fail to realize time and time again.  Remember when they first started building the &#8220;Black and Brown&#8221; coalitions of blacks and latinos?  Well, latinos are now displacing blacks, have taken their jobs and are so racist against them off the charts.</p>
<p>A smart American Patriot would seek to expose all the rifts in modern leftists to enlighten them on how diversity is NOT really a strength.</p>

		<p>Good luck with that.  I&rsquo;ve had a few run-ins with the area hardcore homeless, and they&rsquo;re violent psychos.  DC has the meanest homeless of any city I&rsquo;ve seen.  They&rsquo;ll eat these middle-class hippies alive one by one, and the local ghetto blacks will prey on them as well.  <br>

<p>It seems they want to make their mark; to feel important. Only, they have no substance to do it. What can you really accomplish with a head full of Politically-Correct marbles? Seriously, I have encountered mentally retarded people with far more sense than these products the PC destroyers of life. Very sad indeed.</p>

		<p>Fights are erupting among Occupy Wall Street protesters, so much so that one corner of Zuccotti Park has emerged where protesters say they won&rsquo;t go for fear of their safety, the New York Daily News is reporting.</p>
<p>Police officers also have been warned of &#8220;dangerous instruments&#8221; being concealed in cardboard tubing, the News says it has been told by unidentified police sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a lot of infighting in the park,&#8221; a police source told the news organization. &#8220;There is one part of the park where they won&rsquo;t even go at night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meantime, Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, is warning protesters at Zuccotti Park in Manhattan that he will pursue civil suits against anyone who assaults a union member.</p>
<p>&#8220;New York&rsquo;s police officers are working around the clock as the already overburdened economy in New York is being drained by &#8216;occupiers&rsquo; who intentionally and maliciously instigate needless and violent confrontations with the police,&#8221; the News reports Mullins said in a statement.</p>
<p>But protesters tell the News they have been the victims of police brutality, not the other way around.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been brutalized and mass-arrested by the NYPD,&#8221; said protester Jen Waller, 24, of Brooklyn. &#8220;They can threaten us all they want. We&rsquo;ve got lawyers, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The PayPal account of occupy Portland has been cleared out by a thief.</p>

As someone who&rsquo;s been rather dismayed by the power and endurance of this movement, learning that they&rsquo;re doing a lot of fighting amongst themselves is one of the few pieces of good news that has come out of this whole recent Occutard phenomenon. Now that the &#8220;We&rsquo;re All God&rsquo;s Children&#8221; contingent squabbling with the Agnostic contingent, I&rsquo;m hoping for lots more demoralizing factionalism and lack of solidarity within Occutard ranks. With a little luck, these idiots might just pull their own &#8220;movement&#8221; to pieces before they can do any lasting damage to society. If they destroy themselves it&rsquo;ll save us the trouble of doing it. </p>
<p>Also: I&rsquo;m not sure what a &ldquo;human mic&rdquo; is, but if these folks came up with it, I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s pretty silly too.</p>

 They are already tired of sharing their high end food with the homeless, and starting tomorrow will serve them only &#8220;brown rice and other Spartan grub&#8221; &#8220;instead of their usual menu of organic chicken and vegetables, spaghetti bolognese, and roasted beet and sheep&rsquo;s-milk-cheese salad.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Yeah that element is out there.  I went to one of those protests.  Actually had a good time.  One of the folks heavily involved (I hate to use terms like &#8220;organizer&#8221; or &#8220;leader&#8221; - its really quite anarchic/primitive-democratic/mob-ruley from what I saw) told me some lib-lefty duckspeakers were wanting to run around &#8220;educating people&#8221; about their &#8220;privilege&#8221;.</p>
<p>I told her that after some of the roughest years of my life when I lost everything and almost lived in the streets and haven&rsquo;t been to doctor in years - that if someone got in my face and started pontificating to me about how &#8220;PRIVILEGED&#8221; I was&hellip;</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going to react very well&hellip;</p>
<p>I think the Symbionese Liberation Army settled down after that and decided to try not to drive off too many of the 99% with that stupid, evil, crap.  But that was my experience.</p>
<p>Nobody really tells anybody what to do at those things and there ARE many participating who are NOT the lib-lefty SLA ideologues. </p>
<p>Like me.</p>

		<p>Any movement like this needs - desperately needs - people to show up. To take the step of going from belief and sympathy to taking action and hitting the streets.</p>
<p>And how does the Occupy movement reward these energetic young folk that show up?</p>
<p>Well, first off if you&rsquo;re white - get back in line and wait. Second, if you&rsquo;re a white male - then get at the end of the line. Your energy, your smarts, your talents aren&rsquo;t wanted.</p>
<p>Tell me why any self-respecting white person who places any value at all on their time would get involved in this &#8220;movement?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fact is that intelligent white men* are people who have the capacity and motivation to establish effective organizations. Therefore it is the intelligent white men who are taking the leadership positions in the Occupy movement. The females apparently resent this, and are making a Feminist fuss. Nothing new here.</p>
<p>* I am not excluding intelligent Asian men, but apparently few are participating. The reference to sexual preference is an example of feminists creating discord between white men of differing sexual preferences. </p>

		<p>There was an article in the Los Angeles weekly, our local commie, porn and hooker ad liberal rag about occupy LA.</p>
<p>It is downtown around city hall and the county building.  Downtown is one of the biggest homeless encampments in the country.  Even LA weekly admits about half the occupiers are the homeless scounging for food.</p>
<p>The liberals always want to help the downtrodden and homeless. This is a good chance to help them with at least food, maybe a warm coat for winter.</p>

<p>I never assume gender, and I usually don&rsquo;t even ask until the third date. I&rsquo;m a gentleman, and I don&rsquo;t wish to offend.</p>
<p>As a gentleman of progressive sensibilities, I abhor the public boorishness of restrooms that are labeled &#8220;men&#8221; and &#8220;women.&#8221; What if a person is neither? Is she/he/it to do her/his/its business halfway between them? Besides which, they are a painful reminder of the separate water fountains in the old South.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted before this online reply I made to a lefty OWS fellow at their website:</p>
<p>Harumph! In your original post you extol free speech but end with the conclusion that dissenters from your views must be stifled! Lol! In similar fashion, anti-Whites like yourself extol the virtues of &ldquo;anti-racism&rdquo; but support programs that further White Genocide!</p>
<p>Anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White.</p>
<p>Pro-Whites support the preservation of ALL races, because we enjoy the diversity of races and cultures on this planet.</p>
<p>We understand that separation created diversity and that separation maintains diversity. In other words, we understand the Theory of Evolution, which is among the many things that anti-Whites hate! Lol! And harumph!</p>
<p>Anti-Whites like yourself need to wake up and stop supporting White Genocide under the guise that you are anti-racist!</p>
<p>But you and I do have one thing in common: we both hate these stinking predatory banks and the politicians who have been corrupted by their money to let them loot, loot, and loot some more!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re anti-White and they&rsquo;re pro White-Genocide.</p>

<p>Actually, I agree with this rule.  It ought to be a fixed rule of grammar.  Always having to say or write &#8220;his and hers,&#8221; &#8220;men and women,&#8221; &#8220;he or she&#8221; is clunky, self-conscious, and makes any sentence sound rather dumb.

<p>Great!  That just means they will fall to infighting and fail.  The women will want to run everything and the macho Hispanics won&rsquo;t like it, also neither will the Muslim men.

<p>&#8220;Great logic. So you want others to have to hide their belief in God instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm, I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t know what the exercise of logic entails yourself.  You&rsquo;ve simply inverted the sentence, that isn&rsquo;t the exercise of logic in a critical reply.  Logic says that if you feel it is your right to publicly announce or otherwise witness to your beliefs, others have the same right, so every time you invoke God in a public group, you ought to have the same patience and listen to everyone present as they announce their own belief or philosophical view.  The problem with your typical thinking is that he assumes that a believer has a special right to &#8220;lord&#8221; their opinions over everyone else without rebut.  The Wisdom of Solomon would say that the best solution would be for everyone to remain silent on the issues of personal beliefs.  Besides, doesn&rsquo;t the Bible tell believers to pray in a closet rather make a show of their faith, and that is because the faithless are the ones who make shows of faith?</p>

		<p>Vick #16: If White people, especially men, that were trying to take part in the Wall Street mess, would focus on occupying the streets around the Federal Reserve, and UN, they would actually be addressing two entities that are negatively affecting them, and their country. </p>
<p>These &#8220;Occupiers&#8221; need a quick Newsflash that Goldman-Sacks backed Barry&rsquo;s Campaign in 2008, or has this gone over their heads? </p>

		<p>This is how the occupiers deal with rape.  Baltimore OWS located itself in the Inner Harbor, an area that is unsafe at any time due to predatory blacks preying on tourists.  </p>
<p>Did you get raped at Occupy Baltimore? Well, call the police if you must, but do you really want to be the one putting a damper on our good ol&rsquo; fashioned protest? </p>
<p>So seems to be the sentiment behind Occupy Baltimore&rsquo;s &#8220;Security Statement.&#8221; The document touts the protest&rsquo;s plan for how to deal with sexual assault, and it&rsquo;s getting attention for lines like this: </p>
<p>Though we do not encourage the involvement of the police in our community, the survivor has every right, and the support of Occupy Baltimore, to report the abuse to the appropriate law enforcement. </p>
<p>Granted, while the document doesn&rsquo;t prohibit the involvement of police per se, it does present contacting the police as a negative or discouraged activity. Sure, we can understand why you&rsquo;d want to get the cops involved, but we&rsquo;d rather take care of this ourselves.</p>
<p>And indeed, that&rsquo;s just what they wish to do. In the interest of creating a self-contained, self-governing community, the pamphlet urges victims of sexual assault to contact the &#8220;Security Committee&#8221;: </p>
<p>Any member of the Occupy Baltimore community who believes he/she/they have been a victim of, are aware of, or suspect a commission of sexual abuse, are encouraged to immediately report the incident to the Security Committee. </p>
<p>The point person for dealing with these situations will be Koala! (sic) Largess, (443) 642-XXXX. </p>
<p>Survivors of Sexual Abuse will be given the support, resources, and assistance needed for their emotional and physical health. </p>
<p>Never mind the fact that it treats a grave, life-changing, psychologically damaging crime as a simple incident that can be resolved with the undoubtedly limited resources these Occupiers have on hand. Never mind the colossal, long-term damage done to a rape victim, which may require medical attention and frequently requires psychological help. Sexual assault is also a crime, punishable by law, with a recidivism rate of about 52%. And how, exactly do these Occupiers propose to deal with the offenders? </p>
<p>Occupy Baltimore&rsquo;s Security Committee will make every reasonable effort to keep the matters involved in the allegation as confidential as possible while still allowing for a prompt and thorough inquiry. All allegations of abuse will be treated seriously and thoroughly investigated. </p>
<p>If the survivor wishes to involve law enforcement, in order to obtain physical evidence of the assault, you must report the incident within 72 hours [note: this is not true, a victim has a 120 hour window in which forensic evidence may still be collected] or the assault as collection and preservation of evidence is critical. Occupy Baltimore will also work to supply the abuser with counseling resources to deal with their issues. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the skewed worldview of the millenial generation: everyone gets to be a victim, even the rapist. Rape is just a result of a person&rsquo;s &#8220;issues&#8221; that requires counseling. It&rsquo;s not your fault. You didn&rsquo;t do something morally wrong; it&rsquo;s your messed up childhood, or your perceived social oppression, or your rage at the state that drove you to sexually violate another human being. Prison won&rsquo;t help rehabilitate you and make you a functioning member of society. Therapy will. </p>
<p>The author of the memo  &mdash;  a survivor of such abuse herself  &mdash;  says as much: </p>
<p>The author of the memo, 26-year-old Melissa &#8220;Koala&#8221; Largess, said she only wanted to let victims know that there are alternative ways of dealing with an attacker, though she said she had once been involved in an abusive relationship and needed the police&rsquo;s help. </p>
<p>Largess said she wanted &#8220;the person who harmed me to work on issues and get the help needed to be a functioning member of society.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of ways people can deal with assault and conflict,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The way we all know is to make someone wrong and punish them instead of work with them to correct their behavior.&#8221; </p>
<p>Largess said that as a victim, she found support groups &#8220;confining&#8221; but, she stressed, &#8220;I&rsquo;m not against people taking the steps they feel they need to stay safe. &hellip; From my own perspective and experience, I understand the necessity of calling police.&#8221; </p>
