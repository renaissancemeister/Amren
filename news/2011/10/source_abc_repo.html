			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Breitbart, Big Journalism, October 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Early yesterday morning, we received a tip from a reader in the San Francisco East Bay area who informed us that a local reporter&rsquo;s life had been threatened by an activist at the Occupy Oakland demonstration.</p>
<p>Our source, who is fearful of reprisal and has requested anonymity, says that KGO-TV&rsquo;s Amy Hollyfield was accosted by a man who threatened her and used a racial slur:</p>
<p>&#8220;We shoot white bitches like you around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to our source, the Oakland Police Department was apparently called to the scene. Inquiries to the police, and to Hollyfield, which began at roughly 8 a.m. Pacific time yesterday, are still unanswered today.</p>
<p>Other local morning news reports from three of the major Bay Area stations suggested that the Occupy Oakland tent city had descended into rat-infested squalor with complaints of vandalism, public urination, sexual harassment, and sex in public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>KGO is not playing up the alleged incident on its website, and its reporting on the Occupy Oakland chaos is leaving out these explosive details  &mdash;  that, if verified, would make Occupy Oakland the major national story it ought to be.</p>
<p>Here is Ms. Hollyfield&rsquo;s report from this morning, in which she mentions threats to KGO&rsquo;s cameras, but not the alleged threat to her life.</p>
<p><br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe title="MRC TV video player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.mrctv.org/embed/106688 frameborder=" 0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p><br>
Hollyfield later confirmed, on Twitter, the threat to &#8220;break our camera,&#8221; but did not mention the alleged threat to her life.</p>
<p>In another report from the Occupy Oakland tent city early this morning, KTVU&rsquo;s Claudine Wong was verbally abused and intimidated on live television, in a tense scene witnessed by viewers throughout the Bay Area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And, as Big Government notes this morning, the Oakland Tribune has described Occupy Oakland as the home of &#8220;[h]omeless people, ex-convicts, at least one registered sex offender, students, unemployed hotel workers, anarchists and reform-minded activists.&#8221; And those are the good people, supposedly.</p>
<p>The rest of the Occupy Oakland tent camp has degenerated into a <em>Lord of the Flies</em> re-enactment, infested with &#8220;bullies, the mentally ill, drunks, thugs and anarchists.&#8221; Violent crime  &mdash;  including assaults against women  &mdash;  is accompanied at Occupy Oakland by drug dealing, child endangerment, and frequent fights among tent camp residents and passersby.</p>

		<p>Obviously, this racist Whitey reporter gal needs to &#8220;adjust her attitudes and perceptions to fit our new realities of a more diversitfied, multicultural, hopeful and better America.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s in Oakland, so she can easily make it over to the next media sensitivity training session by the Media Diversity Monitors at the Maynard Media Center of Structural Inequality:</p>
<p>&#8220;The media has made great strides since the days when mainstream newsrooms were mostly male, almost exclusively white and often declined to report on communities of color. Yet even today people of color too often find themselves over represented in stories about crime, sports and entertainment and too infrequently in stories about business, lifestyle and everyday life. The problem is compounded by the fact that news stories still rely on the personal narrative, often ignoring the structures and policies in place that go a long way toward defining our lives. With our list of resources, coverage analysis and suggested tips, the Maynard Media Center on Structural Inequity is a resource for journalists looking to better address the complex issues that lead to structural inequity in our society.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Still think the Occutards and the Tea Partiers are alike?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s going to take incidents like these for these white liberal media types to learn.</p>
<p>I have noticed in the last several days that there have been a spate of stories about people either committing crimes or being arrested for prior warrants at these Occutard hovels.  If you&rsquo;re a police detective in a big city with the duty of finding those with prior warrants, you might want to head down to said hovels, you&rsquo;ll clear out your backlog in short order.</p>

		<p>They hate the reporter Hollyfield because she is blond and really pale.  A hispanic or black female wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten such bad treatment.  I am surprised to see blacks in a public demonstration like this, they must think that THEIR interests need help.This incident should receive a lot of publicity, but because the victim is white, it won&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>If that weasel Andrew Breitbart&rsquo;s name is on it, then I have my doubts about it. Breitbart and his boy-stooges like James O&rsquo;Keefe and Jason Mattera are just agitators. GOP shills like Rush and Hannity want to portray the Occupy movement as a bunch of left-over, dirty hippies who are too lazy to find a job.</p>
<p>Privatize Profits - Socialize Losses is the Business Model for Wall Street. No Fault Capitalism at its finest.</p>
<p>And what was one of the root causes of the current financial mess? Sub-prime mortages that were given to any minority (including illegal immigrants) who had a beating pulse.</p>

		<p>Well, if she were just a White coach, she wouldn&rsquo;t need to worry about getting shot, just beaten near to death by an all black gang of all black football players from a rural Georgia county high school.   Sparta has a beautiful Confederate monument, but you can&rsquo;t go there to praise it.  Too dangerous for Whiteys to be seen walking around with unrestricted White privilege.  </p>

<p>Georgia Bureau of Investigation finally succumbs to public pressure and will investigate the raceless crime in Warren County.  Don&rsquo;t expect any more news on this one. The GBI is full of Diversity, and they will never do anything that would risk &#8220;stoking racial racial tensions&#8221;.  The case will be determined as &#8220;just an unfortunate misunderstanding from which we can all move on by celebrating Diversity at the next NAACP youth summit and voter registration drive&#8221;.<br>

		<p>My my my&hellip; I don&rsquo;t even know where to begin. Here we have Occupy Cleveland and it is quite &#8220;diverse-friendly&#8221;, as you can imagine. Any old, gray decrepit Rust Belt city of the Midwest can fit that description. So Here in Cleveland a young mentally -handicapped girl complained of being raped by one the occupiers in a makeshift tent. The problem is that black criminals see these events to catch unsuspecting citizens off guard and take advantage. I happen to agree with the basic principles of both the Tea Partiers and the Occupiers of Wall Street. Cut back on greed and hold government and corporations accountable. But I&rsquo;ll be damned if I go to a massive demonstration of any type without my license to carry and the firearm itself. Common sense. America sure isn&rsquo;t what it was 50 yrs agoo. </p>

		<p><i>&hellip;portray the Occupy movement as a bunch of left-over, dirty hippies who are too lazy to find a job.</i></p>
<p>Because a lot of them are.  Most Occtuards do have jobs, but if they can hang around Occtuard hovels and not go to their jobs, their supervisors probably don&rsquo;t care.  Ergo their jobs are probably government make work or some kind of leftist &#8220;non profit&#8221; drivel with a leftist Occutard supervisor.</p>
<p>Believe me, I know where this conversation is heading.  Starts with the letter J.  I guess since Breitbart is one, everything he says is automatically suspect, including two plus two equals four, n&rsquo;est pas?  Actually, from my informal count, a majority of &#8220;J&#8221; members of Congress, who are mostly Democrats, support the Occutards.</p>
<p>BTW, those &#8220;neo-cons&#8221; you (and to an extent, I) despise so much?  They&rsquo;ve talked about the affirmative action nature of the subprime crisis plenty.  What they don&rsquo;t do enough is blame Bush and the <i>sine qua non</i> of the subprime tragedy, his push for no down payment mortgages.  </p>

		<p>Curiouser and curiouser&hellip;but I must say I&rsquo;m confused. I thought the occupy Wall Street protests were mainly a white phenomena, at least according to an Amren story a couple of weeks ago. Has the movement been co-opted by the &#8220;homeless&#8221; and squatters, at least in this case? </p>
<p>Also, I thought the occupy Wall Street protesters <i>wanted</i> attention and publicity, so why the threats against reporters? This further confirms that the protest has been taken over by criminal elements, highlighting the stupidity of the protests in the first place. </p>
<p>None of the blame for the Wall Street bailout falls on Obama of course. He is totally blameless and above board.</p>

		<p>@Vito Danelli: Agreed. Chuckleheads like Limbaugh and Breitbart are as much pawns of the bankster ripoff artists as the MSM are of the race hustlers. Sure, there are plenty of irritating hippies at these things and the whole &#8220;minorities speak first&#8221; thing is pretty nauseating, but there are also plenty of regular folks who have just had  it with being fleeced over and over again by the whole rotten system. Good for them, it&rsquo;s about time. The fat cat&rsquo;s worst nightmare is the Tea Party and the Occupiers finding common ground. </p>

<p><i>The fat cat&rsquo;s worst nightmare is the Tea Party and the Occupiers finding common ground. </i></p>
<p>Sorry, people who work for a living and people who consider defecating on cop cars a legitimate form of protest have no common ground, they have coincidences.  Tea Partiers don&rsquo;t like being taxed to pay for bailouts, Occutards don&rsquo;t like that they&rsquo;re not getting bailouts.  It&rsquo;s a really big difference.</p>
<p>One more thing, why are these Occutards &#8220;occupying&#8221; the cities where their kook left mentality already reigns?  Occupy San Francisco?  Oakland?  Seattle?  That&rsquo;s about as redundant as Campus Crusade for Christ making a stop at Liberty University.  Then the answer hit me like a ton of bricks - My question has the answer.  The reason the occutards are all camping out in the big cities run by leftists is because the leftist politicians who run big cities will ignore the numerous city ordinances, safety codes and park regulations the &lsquo;Tards can&rsquo;t help but violate just by doing what they&rsquo;re doing.  That&rsquo;s because the big city politicians are fellow travelers.</p>
<p>It is meaningless that we might agree with a few of their points.  A broken clock is right twice a day, after all.</p>

And those are its good points.</p>
<p>But seriously, folks&hellip; The Occutards of each city will naturally reflect that city. And Bay Area Occutards (esp. on the, ahem, OAKLAND side) will naturally be among the wildest and craziest and violentest of them all. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We shoot white bitches like you around here&rdquo;? For anyone paying attention, this is just par for the course. Hey, at least this time they gave the &#8220;white bitch&#8221; fair warning. In most situations involving Angry Black Radicals, it&rsquo;s shoot first, issue warnings later. </p>

		<p>I find it interesting that, as it was in the 60&rsquo;s, a high proportion of the organizers of these protests are of a specific background, and yet anti-Israel propaganda appears at the protests frequently.  I don&rsquo;t care to mythologize about the deceptive abilities of said group, but I have also learned not to accept anything on its face when they are involved.</p>

<p>Believe me, the solution to the diversity dilemma is the Asian infusion. I also live in the Bay Area but I won&rsquo;t tell you which town. You can do the research and find for yourself which communities have the lowest crime rates and the best schools while still having a majority-minority. The Chinese are the solution.</p>

		<p>I live near a small WV city of about 50,000, 7% black.  Some Occupiers  &mdash;  or whatever excuse passes for them  &mdash;  have set up camp alongside a bank, taking up about half a block on a heavily traveled avenue.  They look like skid-row bums who would normally be hanging out under one of the bridges.  I can just imagine how the city&rsquo;s riff-raff must be drawn to these silly hippies, hoping for food, liquor, dope, and sex.  To even walk through this mess of makeshift tents, signs, and sleazy people, one would have to pass between them and the bank or walk off the sidewalk, into the danger of traffic.  If all this Obama-sanctioned uproar wasn&rsquo;t going on, I believe the police would have cleared these hobos out weeks ago.</p>

		<p>5 days a week I catch a bus at a stop across the street from Frank Ogawa Plaza, where the Oakland protesters are squatting. Growing up in Oakland and walking around in Oakland while white, even in areas that are multi-cultural and not predominately black, will get you a lot of &#8220;White bitch&#8221; comments. I have been spat on, screamed at, assaulted and sexually harassed my whole life. Yesterday we had an earthquake and a crazy black woman came up to me at the bus stop and started screaming that it was my fault and I had better get my act together before God kills me and shakes me off the earth.</p>

		<p>I can just hear the defense of the black man who made the threat if he is ever caught:</p>
<p>&#8220;Racial slurs? I didn&rsquo;t make no racial slurs! I called her white. How is that a slur? I also called her a b***h. That ain&rsquo;t racial! I call black women that all the time!&#8221;&#8220;</p>
<p>Uh, no, genius, it&rsquo;s when you put the two words <i>together</i> that it becomes a racial slur.</p>

		<p>A thought experiment: A black female reporter is covering a Tea Party rally. A white male tea partier says to her,&#8221;We Shoot Black Bitches Like You Around Here&#8221;. What would the reaction be from the newsers, from the neocons, from the liberals, and from the Tea Party itself. </p>

		<p>&#8220;When will PC-besotted major news nets like ABC stop sending their cheesecake blondie journo-bimss into dangerous 3rd World/Commie enclaves like Tahrir Square and Occupy Oakland? When they&rsquo;ve lost a few crippingly expensive liability lawsuits, that&rsquo;s when. &#8220;</p>
<p>Any injuries of reporters on the job are covered by workmen&rsquo;s comp, not liability.  In most states if not all, an employee covered by workmen&rsquo;s comp cannot sue for anything else but medical care, lost wages and if the employee is too disabled to work again, wages for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The workmen&rsquo;s comp boards are like every other govt benefit.  Like disability, SBA loans everything but social security and unemployment, there is a lot of discrimination against Whites in WC benefits.</p>
<p>An illegal with back and shoulder pain and no xrays, cat scans or MRIs showing any injuires gets WC.  A White that falls off a ladder and breaks both hips will spend years just getting medical treatment.</p>
<p>The employeer&rsquo;s attorneys are mostly White.  But the boards that approve the awards are mostly minorities who hate Whites.</p>
<p>No different from section 8, senior housing and the rest of govt benefits.</p>
<p>All the injured reporters will get is medical treatment.  The women who are raped will get therapy.  If they mention the race or ethnicity of the rapist the therapist will close the session because the victim is a racist and write that down in the medical report.</p>
<p>The New York and other northern cities OWS will be good for the homeless. Heaters, tents, sleeping bags and lots of good food.</p>

		<p>From Baltimore.  Seems as though crime at the protests reflects the community. Downtown Manhattan, White, downtown Oakland and Baltimore, black.</p>
<p>&#8216;Occupy&rsquo; memo could discourage victims from reporting assaults<br>
Protest group says it wants to be self-contained community</p>
<p>October 19, 2011|By Peter Hermann, The Baltimore Sun<br>
Efforts by the Occupy Baltimore protest group to evolve into a self-contained, self-governing community have erupted into controversy with the distribution of a pamphlet that victim advocates and health workers fear discourages victims of sexual assaults from contacting police.</p>
<p>The pamphlet says that members of the protest group who believe they are victims or who suspect sexual abuse &#8220;are encouraged to immediately report the incident to the Security Committee,&#8221; which will investigate and &#8220;supply the ABUSER with counseling resources.&#8221; </p>
<p>The directive also says, in part, &#8220;Though we do not encourage the involvement of the police in our community, the survivor has every right, and the support of Occupy Baltimore, to report the abuse to the appropriate authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite this caveat, the heads of three rape crisis centers and a nurse who runs the forensic division at Mercy Medical Center called the message about not involving police dangerous. They said it contains erroneous information that could undermine efforts to convince victims to properly report crimes and get the counseling they need.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might actually passively prevent someone from seeking justice,&#8221; said Jacqueline Robarge, the executive director of Power Inside, a nonprofit support group that helps women who have been victimized.</p>
<p>The hodgepodge of anti-establishment activists who have erected a tent city at the Inner Harbor as part of the broader Occupy Wall Street movement are trying to develop their own rules of conduct, developed through committees and approved by a general assembly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that they want to transform themselves,&#8221; Robarge said. &#8220;But they have to do that in the context of our culture and community. &hellip; We&rsquo;re talking about people&rsquo;s lives here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;security statement&#8221; appears to be one of several attempts to govern what the memo calls &#8220;our newly forming, delicate yet strong community.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokeswoman, Jessica Lewis, a 31-year-old publicist, said the statement &#8220;in no way discourages people to contact the police.&#8221; But she said Occupy Baltimore, now entering its third week, is &#8220;trying to be a self-contained community and deal with conflicts internally as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewis said there have been no reports of sexual assaults or rapes at the Baltimore protest site. But she said that members of the &#8220;security committee&#8221; have mediated several disputes involving allegations of sexual harassment.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Our source, who is fearful of reprisal and has requested anonymity, says that KGO-TV&rsquo;s Amy Hollyfield was accosted by a man who threatened her and used a racial slur:&#8221;</p>
<p>He or she is not afraid of reprisal from the thugs who threatened Ms. Hollyfield, but from being fired for unconscious racism and lack of commitment to diversity and insensitivity by whatever media he or she works for.</p>
<p>Could be Ms. Hollyfield herself. her employer is probably after her because she reported the incident.</p>
<p>The media criticizes the Catholic Church because it covers up sex crimes by priests.  They cover up far more black on White sex crimes every month than the Church does in a decade.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 31 - excellent point about the media castigating the Catholic church about coverups. When, like you said, they omit thousands of race-related stories all the time, conveniently only when the assailant is black and the victim White, which is around 90% of interracial crime according to the US DOJ website stats. Kind of makes you wonder what kind of nonsense is being reported 90% of the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every white reporter should have to live in a minimum 65% minority neighborhood for 6 months before going on air. If they still feel sympathy towards the dispossessed, so be it. But they ought to at least have to experience real life first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you made this a requirement, they would choose to live in an ASIAN neighborhood&hellip;..I teach in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s 80 percent minority but virtually all the minorities are Asians; mostly Chinese, but also some Korean, Vietnamese, and South Asian kids.</p>
<p>Believe me, the solution to the diversity dilemma is the Asian infusion. I also live in the Bay Area but I won&rsquo;t tell you which town. You can do the research and find for yourself which communities have the lowest crime rates and the best schools while still having a majority-minority. The Chinese are the solution.<br>

<p>&#8220;Jennifer&#8221;&hellip;..take your Asians and deport yourself and them. We don&rsquo;t need them or you. I grew up in a mostly White America (5 decades ago) and there was NOTHING better nor safer than a White nation. The good ole days,were actually the GOOD OLE DAYS. Today&rsquo;s America is a nightmare thanks to people like yourself.</p>
<p>BTW I, along with many posters here, have noticed how OFTEN (100% of the time) you praise &#8220;asians&#8221;, especially the Chinese on Amren and have come to the conclusion that you are an asian/chinese. We will wait for your usual denial. </p>

<p>BTW I do not hate Chinese people.  At least their nation is predominantly Chinese, and not a hodge-podge.  Why can&rsquo;t we have the same?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s open season on Whites. White genocide is being carried out chiefly by removal in white countries of the barriers that maintain biological differences between human subspecies, and by flooding our habitat with human subspecies that are different from us. Such removal of natural barriers always extinguishes in a relatively short time whatever subspecies are involved, and results in a new mixed breed distinct from either. We can see that happening presently in the ever increasing number of mixed children being born in our country&hellip;how many of us now know a family that has mixed children somewhere in it?</p>
<p>But actual killing of White individuals, as is happening in South Africa and Zimbabwe today at a higher rate than it&rsquo;s happening here yet, will likely become more widespread as our society disintegrates further and whites are blamed for everything and are killed for the little bit of goods they possess in a hard time. Today black gangs play the game of assaulting and &#8220;knocking out&#8221; (the so called &#8220;knock out game&#8221;) random whites, but eventually the game may resemble more the little-publicized Nation of Islam Zebra murders that took so many white lives in California years ago, when NOI members won their &#8220;death angel wings&#8221; by each killing a certain number of whites.</p>
<p>Pro-Whites are effectively fighting the anti-White program of White Genocide here:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/glNqp" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/glNqp</a></p>
<p>Supporters of White Genocide claim to be anti-racist, but what they are is anti-white. </p>
<p>Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.</p>
<p>Those words (and others at the linked site) need to be repeated and repeated until they&rsquo;ve pushed the enemy&rsquo;s terminology (&#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;bigot,&#8221; &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; etc.) out of peoples&rsquo; minds and people can receive the truth. Please help get these words and understandings into the public mind!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nation of Islam Zebra murders that took so many white lives in California years ago, when NOI members won their &ldquo;death angel wings&rdquo; by each killing a certain number of whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were 271 known murders. There were probably more.  In San Francisco, a black muslim police officer monitored the investigation and let the killers know where the police were.  The killers could then go elsewhere to hunt for victims.</p>
<p>The main witness was one of the killers themselves.  A sketch of the killers appeared in the papers.  He was afraid he would be recognized.  He turned himself in.</p>
<p>The investigating officers had him, his wife and their baby safe in a hotel under a false name. The black muslim police officer who monitored the investigation told the black muslims where the witness was and what name he and his family used in the hotel.</p>
<p>The hotel clerks called the investigators and 911 when black muslims armed with rifles invaded the hotel looking for the witness.  The investigators managed to get to the hotel and get the witness and his family out before the black muslims got to them.</p>
<p>That is how deep it went.  Although the identity of the black police officer who helped the black muslims was known, he was not disciplined, it was covered up and he went on to get several affirmative action promotions.</p>
<p>If the Zebra killings were repeated in San Francisco today, I doubt the killers would be convicted.  Perhaps if all the victims were gay.  The gay community of San Francisco is White, but they are also racist anti White liberals, as is the district attorney&rsquo;s office.<br>
