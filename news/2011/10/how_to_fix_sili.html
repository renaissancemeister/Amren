			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dylan Tweeney, October 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Silicon Valley has a race problem.</p>
<p>{snip} And, while it&rsquo;s great that CNN has made waves with previews of its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/video/?iid=EL#/video/us/2011/10/21/soledad-obrien-black-tech-entrepreneurs.cnn">upcoming show on the subject</a>, you don&rsquo;t need cable TV to tell you that, either. {snip}</p>
<p>Just look around. Anyone who works in the Valley for any length of time will have noticed the alarmingly large number of white guys occupying positions of power. There are a few women, and there are sizable contingents of Asian entrepreneurs among the entrepreneurial and venture capital classes. But there are not many women and there are almost no black or Hispanic entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The White House photo of Barack Obama having dinner with a table full of Silicon Valley titans in February is the perfect illustration of this. Look at the table: It&rsquo;s almost all white guys. There are two women, one of whom (I think) is the wife of the host, and the other of whom is Carol Bartz, then the CEO of Yahoo, who is known  &mdash;  and criticized  &mdash;  for being loudmouthed and aggressive. And there&rsquo;s just one black guy: the President of the United States.</p>
<p>This picture is probably 100% representative of dinners among Silicon Valley&rsquo;s most successful entrepreneurs and investors, except that the black guy isn&rsquo;t usually there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re black, Hispanic or female, I can&rsquo;t tell you anything about racism that you don&rsquo;t already know. You&rsquo;re going to need an extra dose of moxie, persistence and determination to make it here. {snip}</p>
<p>But I can tell you what I&rsquo;m doing about Silicon Valley&rsquo;s race problem. And if you&rsquo;re one of the white guys who run things around here, you should consider that you have a responsibility to do the same things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve hesitated about writing this post. But I decided I couldn&rsquo;t keep silent about this, because one of my career goals, for the past 10 years, has been to make Silicon Valley more accessible to people like my daughter, who is both black and female. I hope this post helps advance that agenda.</p>
<p>So, here are my tips for white guys on how to fight racism and sexism.</p>
<p>First, educate yourself. You don&rsquo;t know squat about racism or sexism. Period. End of sentence. So read. Watch movies. But most of all, talk to people. Find people who are trained in anti-racist education and invite them to educate you.</p>
<p>In my case, I have spent many, many hours in anti-racism seminars, educational programs about race and culture, and dinner table discussions with my family, extended family and friends. It&rsquo;s a topic that is never far from my mind.</p>
<p>Second, make an effort to connect with people who are different from you. Make friends with people. Extend your social circle.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Third, when you&rsquo;re recruiting, widen the circle of candidates. Make decisions about who to hire (or invest in) based on merit. But make sure the pool is diverse, so you can at least make fair choices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This is, I think, the most important thing that white people in positions of power can do.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a real benefit to this diversity, too, beyond some abstract notion of fairness. A diverse workforce is going to better at producing products that appeal to a broad range of customers.</p>
<p>And diversity breeds creativity. People who come from different backgrounds are more likely to have different approaches to problems, or different ideas. Bring them together and yes, there can be conflict and misunderstandings. But out of that conflict can often come much better ideas than you&rsquo;d get from a roomful of people who have the same backgrounds.</p>
<p>Finally, be willing to talk about race. Realize that you are going to sound like a clueless idiot much of the time. But also know that for people of color, race and racism are constant topics of discussion. Race is an incredible taboo only for white, middle-class people. We are embarrassed to talk about it, or even to acknowledge it. But until we do, we can&rsquo;t really learn. {snip}</p>

<p>It is not embarrassment at all.  It is fear of losing one&rsquo;s job if one speaks the truth about it.  These Valley types are quite removed from the reality of real-world blacks with IQs of 85.  They are only used to the top 1 or 2 percent.  And I bet that even these have traits that most employers, if the truth was known, are not happy with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Second, make an effort to connect with people who are different from you.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I would suggest connecting with various posters at American Renaissance or my own blog, jewamongyou at wordpress.  We are probably different from you and we can teach you well-established facts that the entrenched establishment will not tell you.  This would bring true diversity into your life and broaden your horizons.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been a firmware programmer/electronics technician both in Silicon Valley and Silicon Forest (Hillsboro, Oregon) for 30 years.   I&rsquo;ve noticed this very phenomenon.  Very few women and African-American men are interested in electronics or programming. I take the pen name of a 15th century Italian super-model in &#8216;protest&rsquo; of this characteristic.  What is strange is that the entertainment and sports industries are heavily dependent on electronics. They don&rsquo;t have any difficulty adapting to or using new electronic devices like cell phones or drum machines.  Now, there are many Chinese, Vietnamese, and Indian (from India) men in the industry, so it&rsquo;s not &#8216;just a white thing&rsquo;.   And there is not a lot of math involved or most technicians wouldn&rsquo;t be here as a result.<br>
  I suspect that near obsessional interest in electronics and programming comes from a subliminal joy in the manipulation of symbols to create machines that do either work or create environments that haven&rsquo;t existed before.  I suspect that the African-American culture puts no emphasis on the pleasures of working with symbols, or creation of new items through the manipulation of symbols.  <br>
  If I could explain this all clearly I&rsquo;d have a PhD thesis.  It&rsquo;s just a hunch/feeling on my part at this time.  And I have no idea of what to do about it or if there is any real need to actually do anything about it</p>

<p>Patrick Buchanan was mostly right. But he got one thing wrong, it is not a suicide. It is a suicide murder. The complicit whites are committing a murder of their fellow whites while committing suicide. It is a suicide murder. </p>

		<p>Having worked in Silicon Valley for decades let it be said that all races should take note of the innovation, management styles, and global wealth production these people have accomplished.  And they have hired the best to produce the best in an intensely competitive global arena.  Further, a very large number of leaders and management are South Asian, and a very large number of laborers are Mexican.  Price/performance is the credo to do international battle.  Get on board, the Internet and social media have had very low barriers-of-entry AND end-users are totally race unaware (unless you decide to tell them).  And where are the other minority groups?  This isn&rsquo;t about discrimination, its about being able to compete.</p>

		<p>The proportion of Whites working in Silicon Valley has declined precipitously over the last 10-15 years.  Many (if not most) have been replaced by Asians (particularily Indians).  Very few Blacks and Hispanics work there.  Since it is mainly Asians doing most of the replacement, I expect few Whites on here well actually care.  </p>

Straight from the mouth of a clueless loony liberal, who no doubt lives in an exclusive all White neighborhood, and has never practiced what he preaches as far as diversity is concerened. Why not respond to some of the posts that have &#8220;educated&#8221; YOU Dylan, or are you afraid to talk about race?</p>

<p>Yes, isn&rsquo;t it terrible that whites have to be so hardworking and industrious and intelligent?</p>
<p>And what a shame on our country that it has an economic system that rewards achievement and ability!</p>
<p>Of course, whites are also the ones who built silicon valley, and almost single-handedly built the tech industry, but no matter. They will get no credit for their achievements.</p>
<p>Does anyone stop to think about just how insulting this is to the entire white race? Whites are not achievers and innovators; they are instead just a bunch of racists and bigots.</p>
<p>And how is Africa&rsquo;s version of silicon valley doing?</p>

		<p>My response to the article (also left on the original):</p>
<p>First, educate yourself:</p>
<p>I have, perhaps you should, too.  I know about affirmative action and reverse racism.  Don&rsquo;t you think it is unfair that I know a black kid that got a full academic scholarship to Yale with a 3.6 from a Detroit public school, and I know white kids who got a 4.0 and a 33 on the ACTs and were denied?  Unless you are about 90+ years old you know nothing about racism.</p>
<p>Second, make an effort to connect with people who are different from you:</p>
<p>So I am a racist unless I have X amount of black, Asian, Hispanic friends?  That makes sense.  I hope I don&rsquo;t need to go any further than that.</p>
<p>Third, when you&rsquo;re recruiting, widen the circle of candidates.</p>
<p>The circle is a wide as the requirements.  If I need someone with ten years of experience and only two black women apply but only have three years experience each, too bad.  You think I don&rsquo;t turn down white people that are unqualified?<br>
Finally, be willing to talk about race<br>
I will answer this below.<br>
Notice the writer of this article answered about 1 out of every 7 posts so far.  It&rsquo;s because he had no answer for the other ones.</p>
<p>If diversity is a strength, how and in what areas?  Did you read the Harvard article about how it isn&rsquo;t?  Google it.</p>
<p>If you want your daughter to work in Silicon Valley tell her to work hard and go to graduate school the like rest of us.</p>
<p>Your average white worker will get fired immediately just for even acknowledging race, is that fair?</p>
<p>America is supposed to be the land of opportunity.  Do you think people should be hired based on merit or skin color?</p>
<p>It is no longer viable to blame legacy of slavery or colonialism.  India and Hong Kong were colonies and are thriving.  Go back long enough and everyone was enslaved at one point.  Look at the Roman Empire, Han Dynasty, Ottoman Empire, the Timurids, and the Golden Horde and 99% of all people on earth have a &#8220;legacy of slavery&#8221;.  YOU were never enslaved.  I have ancestors that were too, btw.</p>
<p>People are at a point where skin color does not matter, but merit still does.  A White or Asian would hire a six legged blue skinned person if it gave them a competitive edge and helped the company succeed.  Do you really think white men would rather let their company sink into the ground than hire a few women or minorities?  If you really believe this you are beyond help.</p>
<p>Please try and debate me about how it&rsquo;s not genetics, I could use a laugh. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity breeds creativity&#8221; - He must be joking. What most &#8216;diversity&rsquo; results in is a dumbing down to a common denominator as everyone looks out for their own safety and takes the easiest and often most cowardly path to find it. America&rsquo;s economic problems, high crime and imprisonment rates would indicate more a lack of creativity.</p>

		<p>If this dork thinks the asian, indian and hispanics of Silicon valley are going to accept his daughter he is dreaming.</p>
<p>His daughter should not be worrrying about the CEO&rsquo;s.  If she wants a job in Silicon Valley she should worry about the fact that virtually all the low, middle and upper middle jobs are held by asians and indians who hire only their own, never Americans.</p>
<p>There are not that many Whites in Silicon Valley other than the upper, upper levels.  Sounds like this dork thinks because hid daughter is a black female she will get an affirmative action job.</p>
<p>If dork Tweeny lives there, he should know that there is no affrmative action for anyone non asian or indian in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Where has he been for the last 40 years that he thinks there are enough Whites left in Silicon Valley to heed his message.  I can tell him that the asians and indians who control the hiring won&rsquo;t heed his 1960 message. </p>

<i>But there are not many women and there are almost no black or Hispanic entrepreneurs.</i></p>
<p>Whose responsibility is that?</p>
<p>Becoming an entrepreneur involves taking your own risks. It involves working for yourself toward your goals. No one can make you an entrepreneur. You have to be self-motivated.</p>

<p>Dylan Tweney is a &#8220;tech journalist&#8221; but has an undergraduate and graduate degree in Religion, which probably helps explain his viewpoint.  Tweney&rsquo;s LinkedIn profile suggests that he may be married to a Haitian woman, hence the black daughter.</p>

		<p>The race hustlers are starting to realize that there&rsquo;s gold in them Silicon Valley hills. The shakedown artists will be setting up shop alongside the venture capitalists, hat in hand demanding that racism be eradicated in the cradle of technology. Never mind that venture capitalists don&rsquo;t give a damn about appearance (they invested in a  hippie named Steve Jobs) something MUST be wrong if white people are wildly successful entrepreneurs.</p>

		<p>Dylan, you are a wuss. You are pathetic. You are a sniveling Uncle Tom. Not only is your fawning pre-emptive apology the least masculine thing ever written in the history of humankind, but also the least logical. You wouldn&rsquo;t dare speak the same way to a non-White. Only hatred toward your own race, disguised as overwhelming cowardice, allows you to do this to Whites. I&rsquo;m here to tell you that you don&rsquo;t speak for us.</p>
<p>The future has no place for you. Now run along and cry on the shoulder of the nearest Hispanic/Black/Asian woman. Sounds like you desperately need their approval.</p>

<p>Listen, Dylan, I don&rsquo;t care how diverse the company is that builds my computer.  I want top value at a competitive price, OK?</p>
<p>If a room full of white guys can put it together, so be it.  If it happens to turn out that the most skillful person for the job is a left-handed Eskimo lesbian, so be it. </p>
<p>&gt;In my case, I have spent many, many hours in anti-racism seminars, educational programs about race and culture,</p>
<p>Oh really now?  So you fancy yourself expert, eh?  Here&rsquo;s a suggestion: come join us next year for the 2012 American Renaissance conference. If what we say is so wrong or wicked, then proving us wrong should be child&rsquo;s play. </p>
<p>&gt;Race is an incredible taboo only for white, middle-class people.</p>
<p>It might very well be for the great masses of white people who have been brow-beaten and subjected to anti-white indoctrination all their lives, but honest discussion of race in public is certainly not a taboo for us AmReners.  We would *love* to have that discussion. Unfortunately it is *your* comrades who seek to shut us up, blacklist us, and get us fired.  It&rsquo;s your side that pushes for laws against &#8220;hate speech&#8221; in order to stifle discussion.  </p>
<p>&gt;A diverse workforce is going to better at producing products that appeal to a broad range of customers.</p>
<p>Oh really? Is that why the economies of the US and UK blossomed and flourished during the 19th and 20th centuries? &#8220;Diversity&#8221;?  Do you think that the economies of the Asian tigers boomed in the second half of the 20th century because of &#8220;diversity&#8221;? </p>
<p>Utter nonsense.</p>

		<p>Oh my God, what drivel.  What pure communist pretentious egalitarian cultural Marxism.  White middle class people can&rsquo;t generally speak on this topic truthfully at all.  It&rsquo;s not taboo at all - it&rsquo;s the truth that&rsquo;s taboo.  Unless we are wearing a hairshirt and beating our flesh off with a cat o&rsquo; nine tails while screaming &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry&#8221; and &#8220;I don&rsquo;t deserve to live,&#8221; people like this author would never want to hear what we have to say.  Which by the way is this:  Silicon Valley is full of white men because THAT IS EXACTLY WHO INVENTS NEW IDEAS.  Like 1000 years ago, instead of microchips and superconductors it was flying buttresses and gothic architecture.  People like this woman (whose daughter is apparently a black female so she is automatically doubly oppressed) are such backward, Koolaid drinking PC zombies.  Baaaaaaa Baaaaaa.  Disgusting.  </p>

		<p>Hello,<br>
This environment is very competitive.  There is no room for fooling around with affirmative action, pandering to blacks, etc.  Either, you have it or you die, only the fittest survive.  New startups are surviving on start up money.  You rush (work day and night) to reach your goal before someone else takes the prize.  Read the story on the company, Dropbox.  The author needs an education on no blacks need to apply unless you innately have it. Read how Steve Jobs treated his employees so that the company can survive and be ahead of the game.  <br>
The author is the one who needs to be educated and accept Silicon Valley&rsquo;s fiercest competitive environment and culture.  Welcome to reality!  Take it or go someplace else.  You being black or female will not count where winners take all and losers hit the dust very quickly.  <br>

		<p>And one more comment to the author of this article.  This quote is from Steve Jobs&rsquo; sister eulogy to him:  &#8220;Steve worked at what he loved. He worked really hard. Every day.&#8221;  Not many companies in Silicon Valley can afford to fool around with affirmative action which amounts to faltering and failing.  Every employee has to pull his weight.  Intel has a black rapper to so call design something but of course no comparison to Apple.    </p>

		<p>Maybe the problem isn&rsquo;t racism, maybe its just that no black or Latin people have made big money out there because they haven&rsquo;t figured out how to.</p>
<p><br>
Why must people from the left associate no black/Latin people being present to racism ? Most times it&rsquo;s simply because they are either not interested in the subject/place or simply have not figured out how to use it for their own good yet. Both of which are because of them not because of anything the field/community have done.</p>

		<p>I think Tweeny has realized that affirmative privileges have moved from black to hispanic and asian, especially in Santa Clara county.</p>
<p>If he wanted to breed with an affirmative action aristo, he should have selected a hispanic for goverment work and asian for tech and scientific work.  Asian and indian women don&rsquo;t do much better in silicon valley than they do back in asia and india. Since HR is in the hands of asian and indian males, they feel free to bring their disdain for women to America.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t hire women, they hire only their own kind, asian or indian males depending on which race runs the company.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll bet anything that the suggestions, most of them at least, have already been tried by these guys.  What they learned was that it didn&rsquo;t make any difference when it came to who creates and runs high tech companies best.</p>
<p>This &#8220;post&#8221; by blackman, Dylan Tweeny (what a handle for a black guy!), uses every upside down stereotype in reading these deserving entrepreneurs his stereotypical racist fix for assumed bigots.  His reflex is that of one brainwashed into the idea that anytime a group of white men are together doing well, it is automatically some sort of injustice to everyone else.  This man proves why neither he nor any other blacks are sitting in that room.  The one black that did sit with them last week is a canard foisted onto the nation by the same type of stereotypical assumptions of black abilities and promises.</p>

		<p>The dumbing-down &#8216;diversification&rsquo; of Silicon Valley&rsquo;s leadership and engineer workforce, advocated by this naive writer   &mdash;    &mdash;   is not going to happen. <br>
Nor will it on university faculties in the hard sciences; and don&rsquo;t expect it among the ranks of brain surgeons, either. Our mad elites are not quite so mad that they can&rsquo;t practice some practical Orwellian doublethink. The diversity they keep propagandizing about is meant to destroy the fabric, culture and majority status of White America   &mdash;  - but not to change their own lifestyles. And this requires keeping three things virtually unmodified: White enclaves (with some Asians) where they live and play and where their children are schooled; their own jobs and power structures protected; and the science and technology bedrock upon which all is built, must continue to function. If these conditions obtain, they believe they can easily afford the price: massive presences of low-IQ and/or alien-invader populations in non-elite neighborhoods, menial and blue-collar jobs, the dumbed-down military, university undergraduate classes (to some extent), and the swelling nanny-state compliance bureaucracy armies; as well as huge Asian contingents in the professions, academia and everywhere else. <br>
This requires keeping some groups, such as rural Christian Whites, out of elite colleges, and keeping White male blue-color unemployment high   &mdash;  - but again, these are prices the elites will gladly &#8216;pay&rsquo;.<br>

		<p>In the 80s I tried to enroll in Georgetown University to finish my Bachelors degree.  I was in the military at the time, so I needed to do it remotely.  The school wouldn&rsquo;t bend an inch or help me one bit, and they finally turned down my application.  A few years later, I enrolled in Penn State University where I met a girl who had graduated high school with exactly the same GPA as mine.  She was offered a spot at Georgetown.  She had her flight to Washington DC paid for and was met at the airport by a limo then put up in a hotel.  She was offered a full ride scholarship.  Guess what the difference between the two of us was?  Bingo!  In the end, she turned it down.  Yep, that discrimination is a bear alright!<br>
In a little bit of irony, I was helped by a black administrator at Howard University in my application process to Georgetown.  He was completely supportive, and aided me in every way within his power.  I had never laid eyes on him, and he had no reason at all to help me.  </p>

<p>Maybe D.Tweeney should encourage black youthhhhs to stop axing for hand outs and forget about becoming great afleaks. Perhaps he should tell them to act white and learn to speak English with some fluency and study math and science subjects more carefully. With this effort maybe one percent could fill a few of the lower jobs in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>In most high tech endeavors, white guys dominate. In its day NASA was a white boy club.  Yes, for publicity, as the agency matured and decayed, a few &#8220;afirms&#8221; were included as mission specialists.  </p>
<p>I remember a Mexican-American who went up in the shuttle.  Upon returning he announced as how he never felt prouder to be a Mexican. He followed that by saying we should legalize all the illegals in the US.  </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t here one word of praise for los pinche gingos that gave him a chance at success in university and then as an &#8220;afirm&#8221; on the shuttle. In recent times he has been sucking up to Philipe Cabrón, el presidente de Messico.   </p>
<p>My thought was that maybe next time he should be launched into orbit on the Mexican space vehicle. </p>

		<p>Overall I&rsquo;m quite optimistic about the future. Eventually darwinismm will make things work itself out. It&rsquo;s like the debt crisis things, you can pretend all you like that everything is great but eventually the work has to be done and the bills have to be paid.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is these liberals really do believe their own bull honky. There was an article recently about Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s personal security team which is basically an affirmative action all star team of women and blacks. She trusts her life to this stuff. She really does drink the kool-aid. Ultimately that is their weakness because biology and reason is on our side. All the have on there side is delusion, which can only perpetuate itself for so long before it collides with reality. You can only smash square pegs in to round holes for so long before the mallet breaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does this dolt have any evidence whatsoever that diversity, in and of itself, is an asset?&#8221;</p>
<p>He probably doesn&rsquo;t, but there have been some studies on the subject. I can try to dig up the Scientific American article on it, but for now I&rsquo;ll just write the basics out of memory.</p>
<p>Basically, the study measured employee morale and two different kinds of conflict in workplaces. One was professional conflict, debate about how things should be done, which is generally beneficial and leads to better outcomes, especially in industries depending on creativity. Other was affective conflict, which is just people getting angry at each other. Diversity was divided into several subtypes: differences in job background and education, age differences, ethnic differences, and gender differences.</p>
<p>Differences in job background and education increased professional conflict significantly, and age differences to some extent. Ethnic differences significantly increased affective conflict and lowered morale, though these effects tended to be reduced in time. Sadly no comparisons between different ethnic groups were provided, nor was there any investigation into effects of affirmative action. Gender differences had no significant effects, though the morale of men tended to be lower in female-majority workplaces.</p>
<p>Scientific American, being a high-quality science publication, just reported the facts calmly and didn&rsquo;t go drawing any conclusions, but I find it was pretty brutal takedown of the current dogma of:</p>
<p>1) More diversity.<br>
2) ???<br>
3) Profit!</p>

		<p>Fear not. When the last white male has been driven out of Silicon Valley, it will be declared officially &#8220;diverse&#8221; even though it will be entirely Asian, Indian and Russian Jewish. Diverse = no white European males.</p>

<p>Well, talk about shooting oneself in the foot!  Apparently, you don&rsquo;t know that Northern Italy was conquered (as Rome fell) and settled by a German tribe called the Lombards.  Milan was a Lombard city and the entire region of Northern Italy part of The Holy Roman Empire for centuries(under German monarchs).  I lived there and the most beautiful Italian women ALWAYS have either Germanic genetics or Greek (in the south).  We also can&rsquo;t discount the fact the 19-20 century trend of English and Nordic women marrying Italians and living in Italy, Ingid Bergman being a famous example, as well as Judy Garland.  I could go on, but the point is that Italy has benefited for hundreds of years from the infusion of Northern genetics, especially the North.  So your museum supermodels were reflections of Teutonic beauty.  So much for your ignorant, &#8220;neo-pagans.&#8221;  We know more about it than you.<br>

		<p>All an average American from a non-diverse community needs to do to learn about racism is to live for a while in a diverse community.</p>
<p>I saw my New England born/bred liberal mother-in-law do a complete 180 after living in Baton Rouge LA for a month after she came down to help my wife with my first born. Complete 180.</p>
<p>My experience with my NE in-laws is that most of them think diversity is great, but I note (and it makes them uncomfortable) that their area is 99% white.</p>
<p>Only my MIL will chime in and say I&rsquo;m right.</p>
<p>I moved away from BR to someplace a lot more white, about 90% to be exact.</p>
<p>I think the study that was posted here about  societal trust in non-diverse communities versus diverse communities is spot on.  I figured that stuff out for myself, having grown up in non-diverse areas, and bringing those naive ideals into a diverse community.</p>
<p>Boy did I learn a lesson in racism and IME blacks are the most overtly racist ethnic group.</p>

		<p>Well, Dylan Tweney deleted my comment at his blog, I guess it hit too close to home and logically destroyed his &#8220;progressive&#8221; dogma.  Since he couldn&rsquo;t argue against it, and since it dismantled his worldview in a few sentences, he resorted to censorship.  </p>
<p>Here is my comment that he deleted: </p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;You don&rsquo;t know squat about racism &#8220;</p>
<p>What an ignorant piece of work.  As a white who grew up in and lives in a black neighborhood, I know all about racism - anti-white racism perpetrated by blacks.</p>
<p>Are you one of those so-called &#8220;progressives&#8221; who has the naive and idiotic belief that blacks can&rsquo;t be racist because they lack &#8220;power&#8221;?</p>
<p>I got carjacked and nearly murdered by a black man who called me a &#8220;white mfer&#8221; while he stabbed me nearly to death.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t need any kind of &#8220;state power&#8221; or &#8220;institutional power&#8221; or any other kind of &#8220;power&#8221; to qualify as being a racist, other than the POWER OF HIS KNIFE, the power of his hand and stabbing arm, and the power of his mouth as he called me a &#8220;white mfer&#8221; while almost killing me and leaving me with severe permanent pain.</p>
<p>It is the author of this idiotic piece that does not know squat about racism!  Go move to Detroit or Gary Indiana or East St. Louis, you naive do-gooder white-guilt &#8220;progressive&#8221;!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I loathe white liberal journalists, but I do admire Dylan for allowing comments. Most white liberals in the media stick their fingers in their ears and yell, &#8220;LA LA LA LA&#8221;, when you try to present them with facts. I&rsquo;ve actually seen this happen while talking with a washed-up celebrity in Hollywood. They really do that. </p>
<p>Dylan attempted to counter arguments to angry posters, but he could not support his statements with facts. I do give him some credit. He was calm and polite.  That is a rare quality. Most liberal journalists would never allow such realistic comments on their articles.</p>

<p>I wonder how he will feel when he comes home one day when his little daughter is in high school and from 2 blocks away hears his daughter&rsquo;s friends screeching MF N***** B**** while they lounge around his house.</p>

<p>Poster 67, where in the world do you get the idea that I don&rsquo;t know that N. Italy was conquered by the lombards, alans, helvetians and other goths and germans 400 Ad?  Do you think you are the only person around who read N. European history?<br>
I also know that the original inhabitants of N. Italy before the roman conquest were celtics and gauls who were as blonde as the germans who came 800 years later. Their descendants are still there.</p>
<p>I learned all this in 6th grade European history.  I know as much or more about 3,000 BC to the present N. European history as you do.</p>
<p>Neo pagan german superiority ignoramuses are not the only people who can read the history of Europe before the rise of Rome.<br>

<p>Judy Garland married an American Italian. Neither lived in Italy.  She was of N. European Jewish German descent. </p>
<p>Simonetta Vespucci was the model for Birth of Venus.  </p>
<p>Looking at her and the other Botticelli girls, I&rsquo;d classify them as Scots Irish types; long thin faces, high cheekbones, long thin noses, thin sculpted lips, pointy chins and delicate jaws, narrow shoulders and hips, much more Celtic than Tuetonic. </p>
<p>Nicole Kidman of Irish descent is a perfect example of a modern Celtic Botticelli girl.  You could photo shop her into one of the Florentine pictures and no one would know the difference.</p>
<p>The Botticelli girls look much more like the original celtic peoples of N Italy who were there thousands of years before the Roman and German conquests of N. Italy.</p>
<p>Many of us have brown eyes and resent being told over and over again that we are not truly White.</p>

&gt;Very few women or African-American men are interested in electronics or programming</p>
<p>just to comment on the &#8220;women&#8221; aspect:  at least through the late 1980&rsquo;s, women interested in electronics were considered dirty or crude.  My MIT dorm floor had a female electronics hacker:  she phone-hacked (had a &#8220;blue box&#8221; for illegal long distance), wired up a light to her door lintel to signal arriving phone calls, did some audio hacking on homemade stereo components (was a solid expert on audio).  She was an inorganic chemistry major with a fascination with explosives:  had shelves of bottles of fireworks materials.  The majority of males on the floor regarded her interests as &#8220;gross&#8221; for a female, and ostracized her socially (her nerd T-shirts and torn sneakers didn&rsquo;t help).  </p>
<p>Unfortunately when I (female) began getting interested in some of the same things, she and her clique of friends thought I was simply stealing her personal esthetic.  The very first wave of women hackers were not very willing to share with or teach their peers. </p>
