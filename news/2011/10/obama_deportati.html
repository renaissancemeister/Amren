			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rep. Lamar Smith, Politico, October 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano last week announced that the Obama administration has deported a record number of illegal immigrants in the past year.</p>
<p>But the Obama administration is using smoke and mirrors to achieve its so-called historic record. Take away the illusion, and the facts show that the administration conjures up its deportation statistics.</p>
<p>The administration appears to have artificially inflated its deportation numbers. It includes voluntary removals in the deportation statistics. But this is not removal because an illegal immigrant is not then subject to penalties for returning to the United States. For example, a single illegal immigrant can show up at the border and be voluntarily returned numerous times in one year  &mdash;  and counted each time as a removal.</p>
<p>Even the Washington Post found the Obama administration used questionable methods to achieve its deportation numbers last year. Just like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, the Obama administration&rsquo;s record is a trick. In reality, President Barack Obama and his administration are giving amnesty to illegal immigrants through inaction. It&rsquo;s no wonder that the president recently admitted to Hispanic voters that his administration&rsquo;s deportation numbers are &#8220;deceptive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take away the hocus-pocus, and it is clear the Obama administration is neglecting to enforce immigration laws. The administration has all but abandoned worksite enforcement actions. Over the past two years, worksite enforcement has plummeted 70 percent.</p>
<p>Under this administration, there have been fewer arrests of illegal workers, fewer criminal arrests, fewer indictments and fewer convictions. This means illegal workers continue to take jobs away from unemployed Americans.</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} This massive backdoor amnesty to illegal immigrants could allow illegal immigrants to receive work authorization and could put even more U.S. citizens on the unemployment rolls.</p>
<p>In fact, when illegal immigrants are allowed to stay in the U.S. and apply for work authorization, the Obama administration grants it 90 percent of the time.</p>
<p>Napolitano  &mdash;  who is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday morning  &mdash;  and other administration officials now claim the border is more secure than ever. But only 44 percent of the Southwest border is under the operational control of the Border Patrol, according to the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s disappointing that the Obama administration continues to put illegal immigrants ahead of the interests of U.S. citizens. Fourteen million Americans are now looking for work. Meanwhile, 7 million illegal immigrants have jobs in the U.S. We could free up millions of those jobs for citizens and legal immigrants if we simply enforced our immigration laws.</p>

		<p>This is not surprising, it is part of the program to break up the white majority in this country.  Of course, the numbers do not add up, it is all part of the deception to make believe that something is being done about the huge amount of illegals here.  The 12 million has been changed years ago to perhaps triple that amount.  This country is well on its way to a third world country.  </p>

		<p>These numbers would be a trick even if they weren&rsquo;t a trick.  For a &#8220;deportation&#8221; only means the start of the deportation process on paper, not an actual physical movement of an illegal alien.  </p>

<p>====</p>
<p>Here are the President Obama&rsquo;s words to Hispanic journalists (CNN, Sept. 28, 2011) when queried his reportedly high deportation numbers:</p>
<p>&#8220;[T]he statistics are actually a little deceptive because what we&rsquo;ve been doing is &hellip; apprehending folks at the borders and sending them back. That is counted as a deportation, even though they may have only been held for a day or 48 hours.&#8221; </p>

<p>This might be an opportune time to mention that the fragile damn holding back what would be a tsunami of legal and illegal immigration has as its foundation four major immigration restrictionist organizations:</p>
<p>1) NumbersUSA.com (famous for its &#8220;action buffet&#8221; providing easy ways to contact members of Congress) and its Immigration Report Card, which provides detailed reports on the immigration voting records of every member of Congress,</p>
<p>2) Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), mostly involved in research and legislative assistance to state, local and federal legislators,</p>
<p>3) VDARE.com - known for its incisive essays by superb writers on immigration and diversity issues,</p>
<p>4) The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) which produces vast amounts of carefully produced reports on various aspects of the immigration phenomenon, from restrictionist point of view.</p>
<p>Representatives from NumbersUSA, CIS and FAIR appear with some frequency in the mainstream media when a counter-point is needed to a pro-immigration guest.</p>

		<p>And the fraudulent behavior of this administration rolls on, and on, and on; if it isn&rsquo;t the DOE, or DoED its Homeland Security.  I&rsquo;m sure there is no precedent but I wonder if any support could be found in the Constitution or Case Law for impeaching the whole of this Administration, including Gaffe Master Joe and Michelle?</p>

<p>&#8220;But only 44 percent of the Southwest border is under the operational control of the Border Patrol&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

The border fence was a distraction too; meant to silence critics and let the invasion proceed.</p>

		<p>Of course, those deportation &#8220;numbers&#8221; are all smoke-and-mirrors. Obama is hardly about to enforce deportation. Hell, he&rsquo;s determined to force amnesty down everyone&rsquo;s throat. Of those criminal types actually deported   &mdash;   what is NOT said: That just about every one of those people sneak back into our country within days of their deportation.</p>
<p>Seal the border! Hold the Mexican Government responsible for the floods of illegals infesting our nation. Fine Mexico. How? By a 35% SURTAX on every dollar sent to Mexico (or any Latin-American country) as a payment or any other kind of money transfer, regardless of the reason for that money transfer.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, anyone that is in a true position to evict/deport millions of interlopers refuses to do it, and the underlying reason is that the more Mexicans, blacks and Third Worlders that Obama can gather will assure him and his fellow Marxists victory in 2012, as all welfare parasites vote Democrat. Bush, the fool, allowed unlimited Mexican illegals to flow into this country thinking they would vote Republican, and the current GOP is also foolhardy in its delusions.</p>

<p>Presently he is promoting another anti free speech bill and historically has voted for every war, tax and program that is destroying our country and people.</p>
<p>This calling out of Obama is scientifically designed to capture the conservative vote.</p>

		<p>Just want to echo #3 E Pluribus Pluribus&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>Especially about NumbersUSA.</p>
<p>NumbersUSA is the best anti-illegal immigration group as far as I can tell, and one very worthy of throwing your support behind. Currently they are right in the middle of lobbying for a new E-Verify law which could put a significant dent in illegal immigration into this country.</p>
<p>To be honest, there&rsquo;s really no excuse for why anyone who sympathizes with what gets said here on AmRen on a daily basis isn&rsquo;t also involved with NumbersUSA in some way. They are a real-world way to get involved and make a difference.</p>
