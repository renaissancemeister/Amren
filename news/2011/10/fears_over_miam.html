			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Donna Rapado, NBC Miami, October 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A wild Spring Break party that was banned years ago in Atlanta is coming to Miami Beach in 2012, and residents are already worried it could get out of hand.</p>
<p>The event, Freaknik Miami, is scheduled for the weekend of March 10-11, according to the official website. For $350, participants get an open bar bus ride from Atlanta to Miami Beach and a room at one of four area hotels.</p>
<p>Though organizers are using the Freaknik name, they insist it has little to do with the now-defunct Atlanta event, which became out of control and was shut down in the 1990s after reports of violence, lootings and rapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one that was actually on Freaknik Atlanta is associated with Freaknik Miami,&#8221; organizer Otis Bailey told NBC Miami Thursday. &#8220;We just pretty much wanted to use the name because of the brand, it kind of excites people and gets people talking about it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Bailey said one event is nothing like the other, despite the suggestive videos, pictures and advertising on Freaknik Miami&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Bailey said participants will be checking into hotels and enjoying the beach like any other tourist. He also said they would be donating high school scholarships in the Miami area and performing community service while here.</p>
<p>But after the events at this year&rsquo;s Miami Beach&rsquo;s Memorial Day Urban Beach week, where seven people were wounded and one person killed in a police involved shooting, residents are wary of a repeat.</p>

		<p>Freaknik is going to be a failure. I guarantee it. It&rsquo;s just an event to promote sex and doing lewd things in public. Its worse than spring break.</p>

I&rsquo;m not very good at putting emotions into words on paper. The sound of laughing so hard that you break into a wheeze and tears roll down your cheeks is hard to convey. Oh yes - their community is going to get &#8220;serviced!&#8221; I recall from my days in the military that getting &#8216;serviced&rsquo; meant that you got screwed! <br>
My comments may be flippant, but the suggestion that an event named &#8220;freaknik&#8221; is going to be a smores and hot cocoa beach party is alarmingly ignorant! </p>

Except of course for the thousands of freaks gettin&rsquo; their freak on who are the freakin&rsquo; customer-base for this freakin&rsquo; event. </p>

		<p>Anyone concerned about Freaknik has a simple solution available.  Make one and only one simple change and the event will be cancelled immediately.  Call it &#8220;The American Renaissance Conference&#8221; and the city of Miami will fall all over itself to prevent&hellip; men and women in formal dress discussing ideas.</p>

		<p>An OPEN BAR BUS RIDE??? That is like a 10 hour drive!!! I predict the first fatality occurs before the bus gets across the Florida state line. The Miami area hospitals should make sure their blood banks are brimming and the morgue has plenty of space. </p>

		<p>Though I live on the West Coast, Miami Beach is a nice change of scenery during vacation times. I love jogging on the boardwalk and swimming in the 70 degree water in early winter. It&rsquo;s a kind of fantasyland with a lot going on under the surface. It&rsquo;s easy to find trouble if you go looking for it, but it&rsquo;s just as easy to mind your own business and enjoy life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also easy to imagine organized crime in the fifties and sixties running things behind the scenes, eliminating undesirables from the idyllic setting in their inimitable way whenever someone threatened to upset the pleasant little atmosphere and way of life. They had little patience with blacks, and didn&rsquo;t pretend to. When I think of Freaknik coming to South Beach, it conjures up nostalgia for the old way of handling trouble.</p>

		<p>One major difference between Atlanta and Miami Beach, race. Atlanta has a Black mayor and is full of guilt ridden white liberals that let things get out of hand over the years. Miami Beach is Cuban. They won&rsquo;t put up with bad behavior from Blacks. Remember the Liberty City riots?  </p>

		<p>Hey, Anonymous #3, I love flippant!  More, please!<br>
Blacks could call this particular weekend of theirs &#8220;The Black Blackout&#8221;, and the media would still try to de-colorize it.  Apparently, some merchants have become so desperate in this sinking economy that they&rsquo;ll beg even ghetto blacks to come to town and spend.  Look at McD&rsquo;s and its pro-black campaign, despite all the savagery that has been perpetrated on the company by blacks.  </p>

		<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing we&rsquo;ve learned in the last few decades it&rsquo;s that any time you get large groups of young black people together, community service is always the result.  <br>
Congratulations, Miami!  Lock the doors and bar the windows!</p>

		<p>Hot black chicks on a bus with a free open bar and about 15 brothers armed with Glocks or Mack 10s,sign me up. After about 50 of these buses get to South Beach,joined along the way with about 500 stolen cars and assorted gangsta-mobiles and then  are joined with about 5000 Liberty City thugs,it should looke like a democratic party convention or Satan`s shock troops heading for Armageddon. Obama should greet the busses with flowers and US Marshalls. He could bag about 1000 fugitives at once.<br>

<p>Imagine members of two different gangs on the same bus.  When a person cannot control themselves in certain situations from destructive behavior they are nothing more than an animal.  Alcohol, coke, pot, big booties, guns and gangs dissing each other.  Name one black person who could keep their head in such a situation.  </p>

		<p>Charles Tiffany I had to laugh out loud at your post.  If the police surround each bus and do a warrant check on every one getting out they should clear hundreds of warrants.</p>
<p>Actually, the Georgia state police should stop the buses and do warrant checks as soon as they get out of Atlanta. Of course they are all corrupt blacks.</p>
<p>Open bar 10 hour ride.  Alcohol is a diuritic. I can see fights in the bathroom lines but only the girls.  The guys will probably flood the bus.</p>
<p>Maybe they will kill each other before they get there.</p>
<p>The easiest way to clear warrants is to just stop every black driver.  You can bag at least 1 every shift.</p>

		<p>Freaknik in Atlanta was all about cars, cruising, and street parties. Seems like this getting &#8220;bussed to Miami and staying in hotels&#8221; thing is very very different.</p>
<p>Atlanta used to practically shut down when Freaknik hit. Restuarants would close, locals would leave or stay inside all weekend, it was not pleasant.</p>

		<p>As a metro Atlanta officer who experienced a couple Freaknics, I have to say that I don&rsquo;t envy Miami Beach.  It was awful. Even though we were told to stand down, they still managed to get themselves arrested in droves.  Actually, I will be very happy if they never return.  MB can have them.</p>

Enjoying the beach = Drunken orgy with garbage everywhere.<br>

		<p>I lived in Atlanta during the Freaknik years and even New Orleans refused to host the event after Atlanta tried to put a stopped to it. Considering that they host Mardi Gras every year and they refused Freaknik should tell you something. Another thing I remember is that some of the Freanik goers actually broke into a South Atlanta mall and went into a department store and actually stole Tommy Hillfinger clothing as well as FUBU wear. Gang members were often blamed for the crimes but who really knows for sure?</p>
