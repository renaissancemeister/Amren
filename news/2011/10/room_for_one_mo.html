			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The world&rsquo;s population looks set to smash through the seven billion barrier in the next few days, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>It comes just 12 years since the total reached six billion  &mdash;  with official estimates saying the figure will top eight billion in 2025 and 10 billion before the end of the century.</p>
<p>And it is most likely the baby will be born in the Asia-Pacific region  &mdash;  where the population growth rate is higher than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>Experts say the pace of growth  &mdash;  which has seen the number of people on the planet triple since 1940  &mdash;  poses an increasing danger to citizens.</p>
<p>With more people to feed, house and provide medical care for, they say the world&rsquo;s resources look set to come under more strain than ever before.</p>
<p>As populations stabilise in the industrial world, almost all growth in the near future is expected to take place in developing countries.</p>
<p>Of the 2.3 billion people the UN believes will be added by 2050, more than one billion will live in sub-Saharan Africa. The Indian subcontinent will add some 630 million people.</p>
<p>It will mean less land and water available for each person. Poorer people, who tend to depend more on natural resources, will bear the brunt as they will not be able to compete with the rich.</p>
<p>The major issues will be how to feed the new arrivals, which will see the need for new varieties of improved crops.</p>
<p>Ageing populations are also set to pose a problem with some industrial countries, such as Japan, nearly doubling its share of the population aged 65 and over in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>This will put increased pressure on pension and healthcare systems.</p>
<p>The report states: &#8216;Another two billion people may be added to the world population by mid-century, many of them in places where hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation are already taking a high toll.</p>
<p>&#8216;Supporting the world&rsquo;s human population will mean eliminating poverty, transitioning to an economy that is in sync with the earth, and securing every person&rsquo;s health, education, and reproductive choice.</p>
<p>&#8216;If we do not voluntarily stabilize population, we risk a much less humane end to growth as the ongoing destruction of the earth&rsquo;s natural systems catches up with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But despite the problems the world is facing, Under-Secretary-General of the UN Dr Noeleen Heyzer said the seventh billion child of the world has a better chance than decade ago of surviving past the age of five than a decade ago.</p>
<p>The life expectancy for both women and men has also increased in every Asian and Pacific country during the past decade, Dr Heyzer added.</p>
<p>And although the pace of development is 1.1 per cent in 2011  &mdash;  meaning an extra 78 million people will live on the planet by the end of this year  &mdash;  it has slowed down slightly from its peak of 2 per cent in 1968.</p>
<p>Professor David Bloom, from the department of economics and demographics at Harvard University, said in a report earlier this year that the issues would also affect developed countries.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;Population trends indicate a shift in the &#8216;demographic centre of gravity&rsquo; from more to less developed regions.</p>
<p>&#8216;Already strained, many developing countries will likely face tremendous difficulties in supplying food, water, housing, and energy to their growing populations, with repercussions for health, security, and economic growth.</p>
<p>&#8216;The demographic picture is indeed complex, and poses some formidable challenges.</p>
<p>&#8216;Those challenges are not insurmountable, but we cannot deal with them by sticking our heads in the sand. </p>
<p>&#8216;We have to tackle some tough issues ranging from the unmet need for contraception among hundreds of millions of women and the huge knowledge-action gaps we see in the area of child survival, to the reform of retirement policy and the development of global immigration policy. </p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s just plain irresponsible to sit by idly while humankind experiences full force the perils of demographic change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Britain is mirroring the world&rsquo;s expansion. In 1801, its population was 10.5 million  &mdash;  and is now close to 62.5 million.</p>

		<p>Everywhere you go there is wall to wall people. There is no quiet place anymore, especially in any area that is relatively nice. I was driving south from LA last night at 10 PM. The traffic was bumper to bumper, late at night, on a Sunday. What will it be like in 30 years? Every first world country has this hysterical need to promote mass immigration. It is destroying the first world.  I never understood this. Most Amren readers ask the same question.  Could some politician, liberal or convervative, please answer me. Are you lawmakers all insane? Why are you doing this to us? Why have you allow millions of foreign nationals with their alien cultures take our countries over? They are now saying the Mexican Pledge of Alegiance in Texas high schools. How did you let this happen? I&rsquo;m sure George Bush and Obama are hugging each other in glee about this, but the rest of us are horrified.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that most pollticians and judges will  never read my comment. The very few who read them will scoff and arrogantly laugh. Perhaps we should start camping outside of their homes and tell them in person. Then they will have to listen.  </p>

		<p>The growth is not equal. It is happening in some populations more than others.</p>
<p>I predict this obvious and critical fact will be missed by the self-appointed overlords at the UN/EU/other hopeful dictatorships. Of course the implications will not even be touched.</p>
<p>The only end results will be less freedom and more brainwashing.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p><br>
<i>DEVELOPING</i> countries&#8221;?   <br>
I despise weasely euphemisms like this!</p>
<p>They are so standard that we don&rsquo;t even question them.   It&rsquo;s typical of dishonest journalists who obfuscate uncomfortable facts and  refuse to describe things are they are  (for fear of hurting someone&rsquo;s feelings&hellip; just like the term &#8220;undocumented immigrants&#8221;).   </p>
<p>The word  &#8220;developing&#8221; puts  a rosy glow on things and makes it look like everything&rsquo;s getting better and better. Well, it&rsquo;s NOT! </p>
<p>Many of these countries have been independent for half a century, and they&rsquo;re worse off than ever.  Just give them some time, you say?   Is Haiti, after two centuries of independence, still  &#8220;developing&#8221;?   When will it finally be developed?</p>
<p>Terminology is extremely important.  The plain fact is that these countries are not  &#8220;developing&#8221;,  Some of them are actually receding.  Let&rsquo;s call it what it is.  They are just simply BACKWARD!</p>
<p>Or you could say &#8220;primitive&#8221;,  if you prefer. I won&rsquo;t quibble with that. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve moved locations three times in the last two years, starting at a city of 4 million, then moving to a town of 400,000, now I&rsquo;m in a village of 400.<br>
What I&rsquo;ve noticed is that every time the population is reduced, that the more accountable everyone becomes for their actions.</p>
<p>See this story today from China, on a two year hit and run victim being ignored by 18 passer&rsquo;s by, these people are currently over 60% of the world&rsquo;s population and are humanities future, while we&rsquo;re aligning ourselves with people not long out of the jungle and desert.<br>
<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/5805540/Hit-run-case-shocks-China-and-the-world" rel="nofollow">http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/5805540/Hit-run-case-shocks-China-and-the-world</a><br>
Is it possible that different racial groups have differing ideas on what constitutes a &#8216;soul&rsquo;. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a &#8220;dog eat dog&#8221; world out there, and we&rsquo;re generously flattering others and underselling ourselves when we say that we&rsquo;re now on the same level.<br>
Retaining cultural differences doesn&rsquo;t have to mean that one culture has superiority over another.<br>
It just means that &#8220;our practices are best for us&#8221;.<br>
 <br>
To a Hindu us eating beef is bad, to us the way (some) Asians treat dogs is bad, we don&rsquo;t eat horse meat but others do, Jews and Muslims don&rsquo;t dine on swine but I don&rsquo;t mind bacon on occasion. Who&rsquo;s to say who is right or wrong.</p>
<p>The same differences apply with language, we had a case in Australia, that now boasts of being a country that speaks 400+ languages, where a Greek lady had a personalized license plate with the nickname &#8216;Kiki&rsquo; which apparently means &#8216;vagina&rsquo; in the Philippine language, so it had to be removed to avoid causing offense. <br>
<a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/motoring/4910761/KIKI-personalised-plates-vagina-translation-offends" rel="nofollow">http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/motoring/4910761/KIKI-personalised-plates-vagina-translation-offends</a> <br>
As obscure as this reference is, it still highlights that we now have 400+ potential opportunities to offend others with our own language.  <br>
Cultural diversity may mean more variety but it also means opportunities to be offended. <br>
Cultural inclusiveness is &#8216;nice&rsquo;, but is ultimately impractical, we have to draw the line in the sand somewhere or else we&rsquo;re going to lose our own identities.<br>
That&rsquo;s not nice, it&rsquo;s stupid.</p>

		<p>Whites in America, Canada, Europe, Australia and in other nations where substantial numbers exist are in mortal peril from the darkening of America. These third worlders will displace then kill us off if they continue to flood into our lands. For Britain and other white nations that are crowded already, it may already be too late. There is however a solution, as seemingly harsh as it may seem. Stop sending food aid to the third world, which won&rsquo;t be too hard once white nations revert to third world status themselves. War, AIDS and starvation will cull the black, brown and yellow hordes to a level the globe can support. Ironically enough, it will be these non-white invaders who are doing more to make that happen than whites will, because of their greed, lust and hatred towards us. All we are doing is enabling people who hate us to invade our lands, displace us then kill us. The world could support seven billion people without the corruption and power hungry tyrants who run most of the world. But that is impossible in today&rsquo;s reality, personally I think the world population needs to decline gracually to between two and three billion with a larger share of whites among them to keep the peace among those who can be governed only one way, at gunpoint literally.</p>

<p>What we have here is dysgenics on a global scale. The world&rsquo;s two most intelligent races, whites and Orientals are having the fewest children while the group with the highest proportion of dullards, black Africans are having the most. If the dark continent were simple left to its own devices none of this would come to pass. In fact, there probably would be a decline in their population. One word comes to mind when reading articles such as this one:  Apocalypse. And I hate to say this, I&rsquo;m probably not exaggerating. </p>

<p>But that is not how it will happen.  This has been calculated and predicted for over 30 years.  The earth is a closed culture.  Like all closed culture life, there is a growth period, a period of stabilization, then a hover on the edge for a short period, then a steep decline.  One of the signs I think make the point of crash close is not just the untenable 7 billion, but the current growing protests.  It is not aimed at anything, but it is aimed at everything, conservatives as scapegoats in particular, but not only.  There&rsquo;s everything from soup to nuts inside, and no new ideas, just recycled Marxism with no one leading.  Nothing will result from it but more discontent.  Eventually it will turn violent because there is just not enough to go around.  I mean not enough of anything, a good life, jobs, money, food, and stuff in general.  When millions begin to die in the third world because we can&rsquo;t feed them, the diseases that will rise out of the massive biohazards will produce disease pandemics that will reach everywhere.  Health facilities will not be able to cope, there will be panic, and people will get violent everywhere.  </p>
<p>Behold, the destiny of man.  And everyone&rsquo;s to blame.</p>

		<p>The world can comfortably support somewhere between 2-3 billion maximum.  Seven billion is ludicrous and those sappy commercials about starving dark kids are about to get worse.</p>
<p>It may be heartless, but nature will take its course whether liberals try to intervene or not.  Worst case scenario is all the liberals (or possibly all whites) will die and then all the other humans, with the exceptions of a billion or two east asians, will die out in weeks.</p>

		<p>&#8216;The Indian subcontinent will add 630 million people by 2050&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Just consider that factoid fora moment.The Indian subcontinent - a region that already includes several multiples of the World&rsquo;s White population in its total, will add an additional number of 630 million in 39 years&rsquo; time - this increase alone being close to World total White population - and this is just one region of the World alone! - never mind the rest of Asia, Africa and Latin America.<br>
The moral is the strictest possible controls on immigration must be imposed right now (yes, it must be done immediately to have any hope of effectiveness), by the western nations.If this is not done Whites will simply cease to exist in their native lands a century or so hence.Whites, are of course, not reproducing and are actually declining.<br>
 Alas the political elites that run the west have neither the brains nor the back-bone to do this.</p>

		<p>Scroll down on this link to listen to what Pat B. said last night on Coast To Coast. I was disappointed when it came to the topic of legal and illegal immigration. Pat wants a moratorium on legal immigration for a &#8220;few&#8221; years UNTIL our unemployment rates improve. George, of course, felt sorry for the illegals because they only come to &#8220;work and send money home to their families&#8221;. Pat agreed that is was &#8220;tragic&#8221;. Not a word about the ongoing agenda of White replacement in our own country!</p>

		<p>As usual, the Third Worlders don&rsquo;t see the connection between having so many children and having a lousy standard of living. And it&rsquo;s scary to think that there are so many people in the world. What&rsquo;s going to become of them all? The economic situation is bad in most countries, and the world is running out of the fossil fuels which have played such a major role in producing a good standard of living. There&rsquo;s also not enough land to go around for people to live self-sufficiently. Hopefully, the world will finally wake up and slow down population growth so that it never does hit 10 billion. But as overpopulation has been an issue for many years now and it still hit 7 billion, I&rsquo;m not very optimistic. </p>

<p>BTW, a bit OT, the SMH tweet to this story suggested a racial motive, but the article says nothing about race:</p>

		<p>There is Malthusian correction just waiting to happen here. If the white nations would stop wasting their money keeping Africans and Muslims alive then their populations might- by virtue of their inability to care for themselves or order their societies- decrease. Yes, the mass starvation and self-inflicted genocide would be an ugly spectacle to spend decades witnessing, but in the end the world (not to mention the shrunken brown societies themselves) would be better off. If we simultaneously sealed our borders to non-whites and began reproducing ourselves again, then white civilization- and by extension, the world- might have a chance of surviving. </p>

		<p>Why do pieces like this always have to contain the usual tripe about &#8216;Aging Populations&rsquo;?  </p>
<p>The primary reason most(White) people do not work into their eighties is because they are pushed out of their jobs by younger people.  If we didn&rsquo;t have Immigrants flooding the job market, older people could and would take up any slack.  And underemployed people would become fully-employed.  Labor shortages are generally good for everyone but a greedy few.</p>
<p>I have relatives still managing their businesses and farms, who are in their early eighties.  They can do so because nobody can push them out of their jobs.  Being your own boss has its advantages.  And if we had the dreaded &#8216;labor shortage&rsquo;, you&rsquo;d see seniors, even those who do not own their workplaces, doing all sorts of things.  White people take care of themselves, and are fit and competent, sometimes, into extreme old age.</p>
<p>I would add that Western populations are &#8216;Aging&rsquo;, because (White) people are taxed so heavily they cannot afford children.  We are taxed, in part, to subsidize the breeding habits of brown people (both overseas, and in our own countries).  Too, the influx and multiplication of brown people inflates home prices in safe areas.  Too many white people live in houses they cannot really afford, simply because those houses are in &#8216;good&rsquo; neighborhoods.  An extra hundred thousand dollars in mortgage debt translates to a white child who won&rsquo;t be born.  Mortgage Slaves cannot afford large families.  The population pressures driving whites into &#8216;exclusive&rsquo; areas turn most of us into Mortgage Slaves.</p>

		<p>  Just relax about your own genocide. When the time comes that whites need help Warren Buffet and Bill Gates will be there with George Clooney leading the charge. Maybe even a Hollywood fundraiser like the one they did for the SC flood victims. But for right now there is plenty of land and water and jobs for the deserving people of Somalia, Haiti and Liberia, we should welcome them all as God&rsquo;s children just like the Lutherans do. We can afford the additional taxes needed to educate and feed them as we are Americans, the richest, kindest, people on the planet, dammit! And if we need to borrow more money to do it and run four wars at the same time our Chinese brothers will loan it to us. Don&rsquo;t fret.</p>

		<p>You guys who espouse pulling out of these dark nations entirely are correct! There is no doubt that once Western money, medicine and doctors left these areas for good, there would be guaranteed decrease in global population levels. They would &#8220;cull&#8221; themselves. It&rsquo;s simply the natural order of things. We in the West are our own worst enemy and the harbingers of our own demise.</p>
<p>Imagine the hand wringing and the chest beating in elite circles, the media and the UN at the loss of these paragons of virtue, these bright future world changers, these phenomenal peoples of color and  how the horrible and evil white West is responsible for their extinction. I say we make the elites extinct!!</p>

		<p>Reply to QD 19.<br>
Not knowing the area very intimately myself I can&rsquo;t provide specifics without having to rely on doing some googling myself, but I can put a few speculative jigsaw pieces down.</p>
<p>According to the latest available (five year old) census data <a href="http://goo.gl/S9xPB" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/S9xPB</a>  (Oz bureau of Statistics for Narromine ) Narromine&rsquo;s total population back in 2006 was at 3,599 people with 18.9% of those being indigenous peoples, which is 8x the national over all percentile of 2.3%. <br>
&lsquo;Dubbo&rsquo; is the closet town nearby with a population of roughly 40,000 which is a 30 minute drive or 25 miles (40.1kms) away. <br>
Unemployment in Narromine was at 7.1% when the national rate then and now is still at 5.2%, which is not unusual for a small rural town anywhere. <br>
But it&rsquo;s safe to assume that the indigenous population would own a disproportional share of that representation considering their national unemployment rate is at 16% compared to the national average of 5%. <a href="http://goo.gl/yqIi7" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/yqIi7</a>  (Oz bureau of Statistics Re indigenous unemployment)</p>
<p>Note that according to this census data that back in 2006 that only 0.01% of the region spoke Cantonese at home. </p>
<p>The main employment in the area is in agriculture and farming namely servicing the Cotton and Citrus industries which is seasonal work with the cotton &lsquo;chipping&rsquo; period being from early November to January. I have no idea how drought resistant those two crops are, but I can tell you that all farmers are getting less rain each year.</p>
<p>Among the many problems farmers have is finding enough labour at just the right time of year, the Australian Government has various visa schemes in place to satisfy these needs such as the Working Holiday Maker Scheme (WHM), which allows tourists aged 18-30 from certain countries to work in Australia for periods of up to 3 months with any one employer or the more recently introduced Pacific Seasonal Workers Pilot Scheme (PSWPS) where pacific islanders can come and work for up to seven different farm employers in a 12 month period. <a href="http://goo.gl/80jH9" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/80jH9</a></p>
<p>So in regards to the actual crime being discussed, depending on whose story you believe, on one side you have indigenous people who are at a high probability of being unemployed, who&rsquo;re at home all day, while these Chinese fruit pickers who may I add needed an interpreter to communicate with the Dubbo detectives   (although they still managed to call our equivalent of 911). <a href="http://goo.gl/R72bV" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/R72bV</a><br>
 <br>
Came home to find this indigenous man, according to them &ldquo;in their (I assume rental) house&rdquo;. <br>
While according to the dead man&rsquo;s partner&rsquo;s version, the deceased man was retrieving a football that went over the fence (that no one is yet to find), when she heard screams and then she saw these Chinese men beating her partners head with an iron bar. </p>
<p>I can only speculate on who&rsquo;s telling the truth here, but if robbery was the initial motive then you have somebody who&rsquo;s too lazy to work, stealing from someone who is working extremely hard. <br>
Now because a low IQ minority is dead, riot police have been deployed to the area and are said to be on standby.<br>
Does this sound familiar?</p>
<p>On how these two distinct groups of people came to be in contact is related to the farmers dilemma of needing labour to quickly pull their crops before they rot, although ironically there is a large unemployed community nearby. <br>
The following quotes are from a transcript of a conference held in 2005 on &#8216;Seasonal migrant labour&rsquo; here in OZ. http://goo.gl/q51gm  </p>
<p>(From Pg.1)<br>
- Currently primary producers rely on both documented (&lsquo;legal&rsquo;) and undocumented (&lsquo;illegal&rsquo;) workers to meet seasonal labour market needs.<br>
{snip}<br>
- The undocumented workforce consists of unauthorised residents (primarily from Pacific Island, Southeast Asian and Chinese backgrounds), overseas students working in excess of permitted hours, Australians working while in receipt of benefits and foreign travellers working without authorisation.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>(From Pg.2)<br>
- Primary producers claim that they would prefer to only<br>
employ authorised workers but argue that &lsquo;the nature and urgency of their need for casual labour at extremely short notice, and the way in which that labour is deployed, makes it extremely difficult to check documents at the time of employment&rsquo;<br>
&hellip;.This justification will make you chuckle&hellip;..<br>
Growers fear that checking the work rights of each individual seeking employment would be time consuming and might invite claims of discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act<br>
{snip}<br>
- Theories abound about why growers have such difficulty attracting sufficient authorised labour. A popular opinion amongst growers is that there is, as one grower puts it, &lsquo;too much bloody welfare&rsquo;. According to this view, social security benefits are too generous (&lsquo;they get the money too easy&rsquo;) and remove the incentive for unemployed urban workers to take up jobs in regional areas, even when there is good money on offer. Somewhat paradoxically, growers are also generally opposed to schemes which would force them to take on unemployed workers, who they regard as lazy and unmotivated. A grower from Tooleybuc complains that he was sent 14 people by an employment agency in Wollongong, none of whom lasted beyond lunch on the first day. Growers say that if welfare recipients are forced to pick against their will, then these reluctant workers will deliberately go slow or spoil fruit or even break machinery in order to get themselves sacked. Some growers also voice a racialised view of workers, arguing that people of a specific nationality or ethnicity exhibit mental attitudes or physical characteristics that make them ideal employees. (For example one growers&rsquo;representative argues that &lsquo;Asian&rsquo; workers are well suited to picking berries and cutting asparagus because they are &lsquo;used to bending down in rice paddies&rsquo;).<br>

<p>So even though our problems are &lsquo;small potato&rsquo;s&rsquo; compared to some of the hair rising events that occur in your country, you can surely see parallels in our respective situations and the issues our countries are facing. <br>

<p>I will never understand how people in Africa crowd into unsanitary city shanty towns when they have so much land to farm.  Why don&rsquo;t they live on the land and feed themselves rather than crowding into cities.  I know that there are countries in the desert areas that have famines due to lack of water but most of Africa has land that is capable of feeding its people.  I don&rsquo;t understand why they are hungry when there is so much arable land.</p>
