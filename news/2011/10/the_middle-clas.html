<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two-thirds of British terror suspects are from middle-class backgrounds and those who become suicide bombers are often highly educated, a classified MI5 document reveals. </p>
<p>The paper, marked &#8216;Secret: UK Eyes Only&rsquo;, also debunks the myths that terrorists and suicide bombers are &#8216;loners&rsquo; and &#8216;psychopaths&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Instead, the security service says that 90 per cent of them can be  categorised as &#8216;sociable&rsquo; and have a high number of friends.</p>
<p>The 200-page document, titled Radicalisation Of Muslims In The United Kingdom  &mdash;  A Developed Understanding, was found by a Mail on Sunday reporter in the abandoned residence of the British ambassador in the Libyan capital, Tripoli. </p>
<p>The research paper, which was intended to be read by only MI5 agents and officers, was produced after studying 90 terror suspects investigated by the security service.</p>
<p>While some of the information in the document comes from the interrogation of suspects, other data came from surveillance by spies and informants.</p>
<p>The report gives a rare glimpse into how security service agents view Islamic extremists, and what MI5 believes are the main causes of Muslims becoming radicalised. </p>
<p>While the report says that Western foreign policy and the perception that &#8216;Islam is under siege&rsquo; plays a role, they are not the main cause. </p>
<p>Instead, the four causes of radicalisation are: </p>
<p>•	&#8216;Trauma&rsquo;, such as the death of a loved one: Ten per cent of terror suspects became radicalised after a life trauma, says the report.</p>
<p>•	&#8216;Migration&rsquo;: A third of all extremists &#8216;migrated to Britain alone&rsquo;.</p>
<p>•	 &rsquo;Criminal activity&rsquo;: Two-thirds of the sample had criminal records.</p>
<p>•	&#8216;Prison&rsquo;: Muslim prisoners who are not religious are often radicalised in prison. The report identified 60 known Islamist extremists operating in British jails. </p>
<p>The study says that the &#8216;mean age&rsquo; at which a Muslim becomes radicalised is 21.6 years, while anyone between the ages of 16 and 32 is regarded as vulnerable.</p>
<p>The report added: &#8216;Where data is available, two-thirds came from middle or upper-middle-class backgrounds, showing there is no simplistic relationship between poverty and involvement in Islamist extremism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The study also found that half of the suspects it surveyed were married and some had children. </p>
<p>&#8216;This indicates that having commitments to a spouse and children did not necessarily restrain these individuals from becoming involved in activity that may have resulted in lengthy imprisonment, if not death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The report adds: &#8216;The vast majority (90 per cent of those on whom we have data) are described as sociable, with a number of friends. Our data thus tends to contradict commonly held stereotypes of terrorists being &#8220;mad&#8221;, psychopathic or evil.</p>
<p>&#8216;It also challenges the theory that individuals who turn to radical or extremist networks are those who are unable to make friends in normal life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Professor Anthony Glees, a terrorism expert at Buckingham University, said: &#8216;I am glad MI5 are privately accepting that terror suspects were sociable creatures because for a long time they gave the impression that terrorists and suicide bombers are lone wolves.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is also encouraging that they believe most terror suspects come from middle-class backgrounds. Traditionally, there was a belief among the spooks and police that terrorists were caused by poverty.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The Home Office, which speaks of behalf of MI5, declined to comment.</p>

		<p>Not surprising. Terrorists and Marxists usually come from middle class if not upper class backgrounds.</p>
<p>They rarely come from the ranks of the poor on whose behalf they claim to speak. </p>

		<p>This is a point many western socities over look. Terrorists will live in a country for years, have western friends, play western sports, and even go to strip clubs i.e. the 9/11 hijackers. And then turn around and &#8220;do the deed.&#8221; The point is that they have unreliable characteristics, ready to pounce at any moment. They can&rsquo;t be trusted unfortunanetly and few western people as fools for being so &#8220;trusting.&#8221; </p>

<p>If that&rsquo;s true, they must have missed a lesson or two along the way. There are some things you just have to know to be considered &#8220;educated&#8221;.</p>

		<p>So the usual &#8220;poverty&#8221; and &#8220;unemployment&#8221; bugbears the left likes to trot out to explain fundamentalist terrorism have in fact nothing whatsoever to do with the problem?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to hold my breath waiting for them to apologize for their deception.</p>
