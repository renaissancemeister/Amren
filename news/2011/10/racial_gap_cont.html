			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox 42 (Omaha), October 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The latest report from the State of Nebraska on schools says while students overall are improving when it comes to writing and science, minority students are falling behind in Math.</p>
<p>As a part of the study, 11th graders were evaluated on proficiency in Math.</p>
<p>The report says only 19% African American students met or exceeded standards in math. Only 20% of Native Americans and 29% of Hispanic students were proficient. Students from migrant families fared the worst at 17%.</p>
<p>That compares to a 69% proficiency rate for white Nebraska students in Math.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The growing gap is not just a state problem. It has been a national trend that has drawn concern for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our education system is falling short,&#8221; says Omaha Public School Assistant Superintendent Renae Kerhberg. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve talked about it for decades but we know we have not made the progress we need to make.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What I want to know is, without much industry to speak of, how are there so many black people in Nebraska?  Nebraska!  So much for a white homeland in the midwest.  I would venture 20% of that state is already latino, or near to becoming so.</p>

		<p>*&ldquo;Our education system is falling short,&rdquo; says Omaha Public School Assistant Superintendent Renae Kerhberg.</p>
<p>How can supposedly educated people come to this conclusion. If their educational system is falling short, why are 69% of White students proficient in math? If they were falling short wouldn&rsquo;t Whites also be in the 19 - 29% pass rate? No Ms Kerhberg, your educational system isn&rsquo;t falling short, its the blacks and Hispanics THEMSELVES that are falling short, as usual.</p>

		<p>Actually, Ms. Kerhberg, it&rsquo;s not the educational system that&rsquo;s falling short.  It&rsquo;s blacks and other nonwhites who are falling short.  They go to the same schools as the whites, use the same textbooks, and are taught by the same teachers.  Yet their test scores are far lower.  Of course, we&rsquo;re not allowed to admit to the possibility that race matters.    </p>
<p>Liberals will talk about the need for more &#8220;resources&#8221; (i.e., taxpayer money)   &mdash;   as if enough hasn&rsquo;t been spent already.  Conservatives will talk about the need for more &#8220;school choice&#8221; (i.e., taxpayer-funded vouchers for religious schools), which, after being implemented, by some magical process, will enable low-IQ students to firmly grasp complex math equations and literary motifs.  </p>
<p>Both sides prefer to dance around the main issue.  Which, of course, guarantees further hand-wringing by blue-ribbon panels and an endless string of articles such as these. </p>

		<p>Only 69% of whites are proficient in math.  That&rsquo;s a sad commentary right there.<br>
Nebraska gets a &#8220;D&#8221; grade in teaching math.  Either that, or our white kids are getting dumber or more lazy, which frankly would not surprise me.  The more whites hang out and around blacks, the more they become like them.</p>

<i>&#8220;The growing gap is not just a state problem. It has been a national trend that has drawn concern for years.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The solution? More money. More minority teachers. More minority administrators. More minority majority school boards. More minority principals. More self-esteem programs. More targeted resources. All for naught. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;&hellip;we know we have not made the progress we need to make.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Wrong. We&rsquo;ve made all the progress we can make. We have reached the plateau and there is no room to climb higher. The limits are set in our genes.</p>

		<p>WOW! 19%.Are you kidding me? Lets forget for a minute the school dynamic and whos to blame. This is VERY troubling for the future. The job market 5-10 years from now will be technology based. Math will be THE most important thing to secure a good job in 2020 and beyond. America will be awash (more than it is now) with uneducated, unemployable black and brown men and women who feel they have a right to everything a college graduate has. They will see what hard-working people have and wont be afraid to demand it all. HECK, its happenning now!<br>
  Things will be worse. Babymamas are still pumping out future crims. Nobody in govt is demanding anything from them. They are emboldened by the non-reaction to their actions. They see whites as cowards.</p>

		<p>I can just hear it now:  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s dem White nummers and rifmatic! It also be rasis maff!&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s wait and see how the lefty blacks and whites spin the results of this survey.  This is going to be rich. </p>
<p>Then again, according to the article, the usual suspect, &#8220;the system&#8221; is what failed the minorities.  Only a Martian would buy into that, but there are also the hopelessly delusional and willfully ignorant.  </p>
<p>The reality is that blacks and browns know they don&rsquo;t have to try at anything.  A lifetime of government unearned incomes awaits them if they feign a mental or physical illness, or if they want a job, there are the quotas.  Across the nation fire and police departments dumb down their exams to elementary levels and still hire the minority applicants who then ascend through the ranks based on their color.  The black &#8220;chirren&#8221; know what these &#8220;educators&#8221; don&rsquo;t; they don&rsquo;t have to try.  Nothing is expected or demanded of them, and a &#8220;gubmint&#8221; job awaits if they so demand one.     </p>

		<p>Well, we all know what this means.</p>
<p>The White parents of all those young white girls in Nebraska need to be visited by DHS social counselors, and there needs to be an in-depth examination of whether or not those parents are refusing to allow their daughters to watch MTV, where Sumner Redstone constantly and relentlessly pushes miscegenation between White females and black males, as a key and critical component of the Hollywood promoted program to genocide people of White European descent and to use our white daughters as gene boosting lab rats to help inch the IQ&rsquo;s of blacks, mestizos, and other non-whites up a notch or two on the evolutionary totem pole.</p>
<p>Perhaps Chuck Schumer, Diane Feinstein, Joe Lieberman and Frank Lautenberg can sit down with Noel Ignatiev and craft a new law that would make it illegal for whites to refuse to mate with blacks, mestizos, or any non-white?   We could title it something like this:  &#8220;The National Gene Deprivation, White Gene Hoarding and Anti-Genetic Discrimination Act of 2011&#8221;?</p>
<p>You know, follow the objectives as verbalized by Israel Cohen in his famous &#8220;Racial Program for the 20th Century&#8221;, right?    Make it a felony offense for any two white people to produce a pure white baby.     Noel Ignatiev would love that, right?</p>

<p>The NAEP in 2005 did an assessment of the reading and math capabilities of 12th graders (i.e. those in 12th grade and expected to become graduates. This is what they found.  They use the term &ldquo;Black&rdquo; because not all 12th graders are &ldquo;African American&rdquo;</p>

Blacks &mdash; 70% read at a 0-4th grade level; 25% at a 5th to 8th grade level; 5% were proficient<br>
Whites &mdash; 30% read at a 0-4th grade level; 41% at a 5th to 8th grade level; 26% were proficient<br>
Hispan &mdash; 60% read at a 0-4th grade level; 32% at a 5th to 8th grade level; 8% were proficient</p>
<p>Reading<br>
Blacks &mdash; 48%/36%/15% respectively<br>
Whites &mdash; 21%/36%/37% respectively<br>
Hispan &mdash; 40%/40%/18% respectively</p>
<p>In 2010, the U.S. Army provided The Education Trust with the results of all individuals who took the military armed services vocational aptitude battery (ASVAB) with the intent of enlisting in Army. The sample consists of the 348,200 high school graduates aged 17-20 who applied for entry into the Army between 2004 and 2009 and took the ASVAB. These young people are among the 25 percent of young Americans who do not have problems preventing them from applying for enlistment in the military. These people were high school graduates or GED.</p>
<p>About 23 percent of the test-takers in our sample failed to achieve a 31 (translates to less than an 8th grade education) &mdash; the qualifying score &mdash; on the AFQT. 348,203 took the test;<br>
•  39% (24,999) of African-American test takers (64,084) scored below minimum<br>
•  16% (32,240) of White test takers (201,501) scored below Army minimum <br>
•  29% (11,824) of Hispanic test takers (40,771) scored below minimum 	<br>

<p>They left out something important.  All the census tracts relating to this school district are between 96 and 99 percent white.  They also make a mistake when they classify the Beverly Hills, Calif. S.D. as &#8220;high performing.&#8221;  Too many people think of Brandon and Brenda Walsh when they think of BH and the schools.  In reality, even before the first series run of 90210, BH&rsquo;s demographics and schools were heavily Middle Eastern Arab and Persian.</p>

		<p>Response to Number Cruncher # 11</p>
<p>I took the ASVAB in the Mid-80&rsquo;s (Probably before they tried to make it &#8220;more inclusive&#8221; for minorities.) Six out of 50 passed with minimum scores to get in the Army. While I&rsquo;m sure this is illegal as can be, my recruiter showed me the scores from those 49 others who were in the High School Auditorium with me. He has since passed away, so the military cannot impose article 134 of the UCMJ on him. One white of six there didn&rsquo;t make the cut (16% failure rate). One black out of the other 44 passed (97.7% failure rate). My high school had about 5 - 8 black students per grade who could keep up with the whites. Barring a felony conviction, they could generally get a free ride to college. I cannot think of one from that really small cohort who served in the military. This recruiter also had a high school that had not produced one student who could pass the ASVAB in four years. (Kind of wonder if he was the guy who would go to the &#8220;House of ill repute&#8221; for fun and end up as the piano player). </p>
<p>Maybe the ASVAB is imposing some of the few standards left in the USA. </p>

<p>Gary:  To speak openly about or challenge the government, media and ivory tower elite&rsquo;s forced dogma that &#8220;there are no IQ differences between the races&#8221; (hell, they won&rsquo;t even admit that IQ exists!)  is to commit heresy in the political reign of terror that has overtaken the schools. </p>
<p>NOW, in California, recent legislation mandates that &#8220;the contributions of the gay, lesbian and trans-gendered community&#8221; be added to the core history curriculum. The textbook companies are gearing up as I&rsquo;m writing this and California drives the textbook industry so this will spread far and wide.</p>
<p>We toe the company line, listen to, keep quiet or mouth the LIES of the NWO because we need our jobs and pensions.</p>
<p>This is why many teachers like me, who are on the front lines, IMPLORE White parents to take their kids out of government schools, find a private school or, better, home school your children, do it now and don&rsquo;t ever look back.</p>

		<p>Malcolm X was from Omaha.  Even back in the day there, the black areas were unsafe.  The thing is majority white areas, the whites there have liberal attitudes and views on blacks and mexicans (especially the ones under 60), because they haven&rsquo;t lived around them to see how much they destroy neighborhoods and they&rsquo;ve been brainwashed with political correctness.  People say &#8220;You hate that which you don&rsquo;t know&#8221;, well what of the white southerners?  How can you say their dislike was based out of ignorance being that they lived around blacks? It&rsquo;s an inconsistent statement the marxists and anti-white folks make.</p>

		<p>If all you know is what you&rsquo;ve &#8220;seen&#8221; in the MSM over the last<br>
four decades or more, you &#8220;know&#8221; that the racial gap has been narrowing, again and again and again.  One of the main programs<br>
to narrow the gap was the Effective Schools model  &mdash;  explicitly<br>
designed by Ron Edwards to refute Jensenism.  The reality seems to be that the various &#8220;miracles&#8221; (as in &#8220;The Miracle of Milwaukee&#8221;from which its psychologist Director, the late Rick Heber, was rewarded for three years or so  by free room and board in various federal minimum security prison  facilities for fraudulent use of grants at the U. of Wisconsin, Madison) arise from details like dumbing down the curriculum, using group learning to Robin Hood effects of stealing from the abler to uplift the slower, etc. and the Effective Schools outcomes seem upon detailed examination to be oddly accompanied by all sorts of &#8220;little gimmicks&#8221; involving also staggering the attainment testing, pulling and omitting from data reporting the answer sheets of special education students, and on and on.  The fine-combing of tedious details from these front page &#8220;success stories&#8221; is pretty much a revelation of what one would hypothesize if (a) Jensenism were assumed to be valid and (b) the professed results were &#8220;levitated&#8221; into existence by all manner of pressures giving rise to creative liberties of the sorts mentioned above.  It&rsquo;s good the geniuses narrowing the racial gap in &#8220;our&#8221; public schools are not instead using their energies in finance or business.  They&rsquo;d, too, be risking free room and board in &#8220;Motel Heber&#8221;.  </p>
