			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), October 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An extreme Muslim group which caused outrage by burning a poppy last Remembrance Sunday is planning further disruption on November 11, with a twisted &#8216;Hell for Heroes&rsquo; campaign.</p>
<p>The demo, which mocks the charity for injured soldiers Help for Heroes, is due to take place outside the Royal Albert Hall, the same location where a poppy was burned last year.</p>
<p>Emdadur Choudhury, who burned the poppy, was fined just Â£50.</p>
<p>The Muslims Against Crusades protesters, who have sought permission from police to hold the rally, aim to chant and disrupt the minute&rsquo;s silence held in honour of the war dead.</p>
<p>Firebrand cleric Anjem Choudary, who has links to the Muslims Against Crusades group, said: &#8216;It&rsquo;s going to be called Hell for Heroes and it will be around the Royal Albert Hall.</p>
<p>&#8216;It will involve a protest and not observing the minute&rsquo;s silence. We had a significant amount of support from Muslims around the world last year.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s one thing to remember the dead from the First World War and subsequent wars but it&rsquo;s quite another when they say we need to remember the dead from Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s become a political football and if they are going to use Remembrance Day for that purpose it&rsquo;s only right that we have a counter protest, which we say is for Muslims.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Army is currently at war with Muslims in Muslim countries.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Choudary also played down reports that MP Mike Freer had feared for his safety after a protest at a north London mosque where he was holding a surgery last Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Up to a dozen protesters forced their way into the mosque where Mr Freer was meeting constituents, prompting officials to lock him in a private room for his own safety.</p>
<p>Mr Freer, a member of Conservative Friends of Israel, said he was called a &#8216;Jewish homosexual pig&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said he only later realised the MAC website had made reference to MP Stephen Timms, who was stabbed in his surgery by a Muslim women.</p>
<p>Choudary played down the protest saying: &#8216;It was peaceful and there were no arrests.</p>
<p>&#8216;As far as I am aware, there is no suggestion anyone from MAC said anything anti-Semitic or homophobic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Brit vets can expect the same outcomes. Good luck.</p>

		<p>It seems these Muslims are saying that it is all right for us to fight back at fellow Christians or Jews if they attack us, but not to fight back at Muslims when they attack us.  I, for one, do not accept that.</p>

		<p>OKk, is it not clear yet that I-slam is at war with the entire non-muslim world?  That these practitioners HATE those that do not believe as they do?  That they see everyone else as the enemy?</p>
<p>They will never, ever engage in tolerance, rationality, peace, dialogue, compromise, nor will they ever assimilate in any society they are let into.  Once they reach a tipping-point of what, say 10%, they begin to agitate, provocate, and call for sharia, and call for war upon their host society.  God willing, their numbers will not grow in the U.S.  (Actually, we should have shut off all muslim immigration after the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979.) </p>

		<p>Have to agree with the Muslims here.  I would be most annoyed if the previous owners of my house came over and tried to hold some sort of celebration in my home.  The key term here is MY HOME.  I own it.  They sold it to me.  Why should I let them hold any sort of rememberence here?  Same with Britain.  It belongs to the Muslims now.  Time to stop pesterng the new owners.  You gave it up, now move on.</p>

Now they must face that their near ancestors are insulted in the streets publicly.

		<p>Seriously, where do they get off thinking they can dishonour the war dead from the country they live in&hellip; I hope some of the EDL give them a walloping. If muslims, who are already quite disliked here in Australia, did anything like that here, where we have many with strong ties to the ANZACs and who attend many war memorials, they would get a serious beating, and I have to say I would join in</p>

		<p>Sacred memories sold as scrap: Pillage of UK war memorials for bronze plaques and copper<br>
Tuesday, November 01, 2011 12:35:41 PM Â· by dennisw Â· 1 replies <br>
Daily Mail ^ | 1st November 2011 | Claire Ellicott,<br>
The Mail reported yesterday that the 100,000 war memorials in Britain are being targeted by thieves and vandals at the rate of one every other day. Thieves steal the brass plaques to dealers, who melt the metal down to fuel the worldwide demand for scarce metals. &lsquo;If people don&rsquo;t take the opportunity to campaign and fight against the thieves, our nation&rsquo;s war memorials will be lost to future generations along with the names of those who gave their lives for their countries.&rsquo; Campaigners fighting to save war memorials from scrap metal thieves say only a handful have ever been brought&hellip; <br>

		<p>History is clear that no Muslim conquest has ever been peaceful. It also tells us they have no desire to assimilate and get along with the host population. It&rsquo;s their way or else! I bet it&rsquo;s been a very long time since real world history has been taught in any UK classroom&hellip;.</p>
