<h1><a href="http://english.pravda.ru/world/europe/12-10-2011/119306-switzerland-0/">Muslim Immigrants Want Switzerland to Change National Flag</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pravda, October 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of Muslim immigrants wants to force Switzerland to abandon the current flag  &mdash;  a white cross on the red background. They say that it violates the rights of the representatives of non-Christian confessions. They seem to have been hurt by the recent ban on minarets construction. However, their proposal is unlikely to be welcomed by the native Swiss and will only increase the number of votes in favor of the treasury of the local far-right People&rsquo;s Party.  </p>
<p> The first suggestion to remove the cross from the Swiss flag was made not by a Muslim, but (judging by the name) an ethnic Croat and Catholic vice-president of the association of immigrants Secondos Plus Ivica Petrushich. &#8220;The cross does not fit today&rsquo;s multicultural Switzerland,&#8221; he said. The organization of the Turkish, Albanian and other immigrants from Muslim countries followed with a similar initiative. Instead, they suggested using a green-yellow-red flag of Helvetic Republic that existed at the turn of the 18th-19th centuries. It has no cross on it.</p>
<p>It is hardly coincidental that the issue of replacing the flag was raised by the representatives of immigrant organizations. Today, over 20 percent of seven million-strong Swiss population is immigrants. Naturally, the Muslims will be more than others insistent on replacing the flag. There are nearly 400,000 of them (more than five percent of the population). The largest &#8220;ethnic Muslim&#8221; community is Albanian, followed by the Turkish one. Arabs and Bosnian Muslims also reside in Switzerland. Many of them certainly do not like the cross.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Swiss Muslims virtually broke off with the religion of their ancestors. No more than 50 thousand of the faithful pray five times a day. However, women in headscarves have become an integral part of the cityscape of Zurich or Geneva. Furthermore, the birthrate in religious Muslim families is much higher than among the other population. Finally, all Swiss followers of Islam are not natives, but immigrants and their descendants. Their support of changing the appearance of the flag is, to say the least, ambiguous. </p>
<p>Apparently, this circumstance was taken into account by the head of the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Switzerland Mayzar Hisham, who called the idea of changing the flag &#8220;counterproductive.&#8221; He said that they did not demand anyone to change the ancient traditions of their countries. It is hard not to agree with his words. The relations of the indigenous Swiss and immigrants have already passed a difficult strength test. The desire to change the flag will only add fuel to the fire. Two years ago the Muslim community wanted to attach minarets to the existing mosques. However, Switzerland is different from all other countries in a way that each more or less relevant issue is solved by holding a referendum. Negotiations with the government officials were not sufficient, and they had to ask the opinion of the population. This opinion was not in favor of the Muslim immigrants.</p>
<p>The initiator of the referendum two years ago was the ultra-right Swiss People&rsquo;s Party that called to stop the &#8220;creeping Islamization&#8221;. A deputy of the Swiss Parliament Ulrich Shlyuer said that minarets were a political symbol of the implementation of Islam. Step by step, Sharia was conquering Switzerland, acting in parallel with the Swiss law. Statistics show that the degree of religiosity of the local Muslim population is exaggerated, but for the ordinary Swiss even a hint of a violation of their habitual way of living was sufficient.</p>
<p>  The results of voting on November 29, 2009 shocked Europe. 57.5 percent of the Swiss population was in favor of a ban on construction of minarets. At the same time kosher and halal slaughter of animals was banned (because of cruelty). Islamic organizations, human rights activists, and many European politicians expressed their outrage. However, the law came into force. The EU could not influence Switzerland as it is not its member.   Many of those dissatisfied with the verdict (including indigenous Europeans who had departed from the religion) were eager for revenge, and eventually decided to strike from the other side. They inquired why the flag of the Swiss Confederation had a Christian cross on it if construction of minarets was banned. Allegedly, it violated the rights of not only Muslims but also non-believers. That is why the red-green-yellow flag of the Helvetic Republic would be better.</p>
<p>Would the majority of the Swiss agree with this point of view?  Unlike neighboring France and Germany, the Swiss society is rather conservative. While there is no case of absolute religiousness of the Swiss society, the number of believers in Switzerland is higher than in the neighboring countries. This can be partially explained by a high proportion of rural population scattered along numerous mountain valleys in 20 cantons and six half-cantons of the country. Approximately half of the indigenous Swiss are Catholics; a little fewer are Protestant Calvinists. The cross on the flag is something that unites the country, and does not divide it.</p>
<p> As for the flag, the current symbol was first used in Switzerland in 1339, when the union of separate cantons just started to take shape. It achieved its official status in 1848, when the last standoff on this land ended, crowned with a robust Swiss Confederation. To some extent, it is a symbol of freedom and peace, a path to which took many centuries and numerous wars.  The Helvetic Republic, whose flag is offered instead of the current one, is not particularly respected by the Swiss. It was created by Napoleon who occupied the country and decided to build entities supervised by the French on its territory. For the free-spirited Swiss this flag is a symbol of oppression.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that the combination of green, red and yellow colors is characteristic mainly of African countries. In Europe, only Lithuania has a similar flag.   Do the immigrants have a right to teach the Swiss tolerance? For over 160 years there has been no bloodshed on this territory. This is all the more surprising considering that the country is multinational. Nearly three-quarters of the indigenous Swiss speak German, one-fifth speaks French, five or six percent speak Italian, and a little less than one percent  &mdash;  the Romansh language. All these languages have the official status, but there is one dominant language group in each canton (with rare exceptions). They managed to combine small mono-national &#8220;houses&#8221; with a multinational one. The country is not threated by a collapse.   Encroaching on the foundation of the state, immigrants cause a reaction from the German Swiss, French Swiss and Italian Swiss.  </p>
<p>Ultra People&rsquo;s Party is gaining popularity among all of them. Its symbol is three white sheep (the number of the top three language groups), kicking the fourth, black one. This is a clear hint to what should be done with immigrants. Four years ago, the party secured 29 percent of the Swiss votes, and it was a shock to Europe. In the parliamentary elections scheduled for October 23, the result may be even higher.  </p>
<p>As is evident from the story with the restrictions on ritual slaughter of animals and minarets construction, the Swiss are not afraid to challenge the infamous political correctness. A ban on wearing the veil is to follow. The more you attempt to encroach on the foundation of the Swiss state, the stronger will be the response. It took Switzerland and its people too long to achieve stability and peace of mind to just give up on their values.</p>

		<p>Well they could always go live back in the middle east somewher if they dont like the swiss flag. I have always wondered why people leave their country of origin, and then want to transform their new home into the one they just wanted to get away from. <br>
European immigrants to the USA and Canada embraced the culture, learned the common language and helped build and defend their new homes. </p>
<p>Modern immigrants just take handouts, steal, refuse to assimilate, and turn their neighborhoods into mini third world nations.</p>

		<p>As a Croat, I&rsquo;m not in the least surprised by this initiative by my -  now former- compatriot Petrushich (Petrušić). Actually, it&rsquo;s a hangover from the 19th century when our national integration ideology considered Bosnian Muslims to be &#8220;Croats of Islamic faith&#8221; (&#8220;Islamic&#8221; being something essentially irrelevant for our national ideologues who, although formally Catholics, have been mostly quite an irreligious bunch, including- ironically- Catholic priests &amp; Franciscan friars ).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s OK to float in delusions ca. 150 yrs ago - but after historical experience of past 60 yrs- including war with Bosnian Muslims 1993-1994 &amp; everyday experience of growing islamization &amp; radicalization you witness in your former classmates and, not infrequently, your bed partners (Bosnian Muslim women had been, in the past, relatively &#8220;easy&#8221;)- I can only say that people just don&rsquo;t learn from experience. Not other people&rsquo;s experience, but their own. Amazing. Suicidal stupidity. </p>

		<p>I know that there is going to be many comments on how the presence of the cross on many European national flags represents the culture and history of Europe, etc.  I want to remark right now that even though I dispute the idea that Christianity reflects the full and true history and culture of Europe, I do not support changing national flags of any country due to pressures from religious groups. Those flags developed during a period of struggle that is a matter of history now.  I think it is okay that Germany removed the cross pattee&rsquo; from their flag, but that was their decision, not a dictate from another religion represented by people from countries with flags that feature the Muslim emblem in EVERY case.</p>
<p>As for the Swiss flag, the best history on their origins is that they formed a nation with ex-Knights Templar as their army.  I am happy to see a symbolic witness to that in their flag today.  I am convinced that the banking establishment in Switzerland, its stubborn neutrality throughout the long periods of European civil wars, its tradition of everyman as a warrior, all hail from the Templar past of Switzerland. If this is what saves Europe, I am for it.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a better idea.  Send the Muslims back to their countries where there are no crosses, then they won&rsquo;t be offended by the Swiss flag.  Switzerland has been a neutral country for many years and they don&rsquo;t need to start adhering to the needs and wants of all these Muslims.</p>

		<p>As a non-religious Croatian, I am embarrassed that another Croatian, and no less a Catholic, is spearheading this effort to change the Swiss flag. This story, as well as others, shows me that today&rsquo;s Croatia is generally getting rather chummy with islam. This development is appalling, mostly because it&rsquo;s like spitting on the graves of the uncounted Europeans who, over the centuries, died defending their land and their culture from the invading muslim hordes.</p>
<p>Croatians and Serbians aren&rsquo;t the best of friends, to put it mildly, but when I look at the current situation in northern Kosovo, I see that the right thing for me to do is to wholeheartedly support the isolated Serbs, because we have a common heritage which, if not supported by us, certainly will not be supported by those who seek conquest under the stealthy guise of &#8220;no offense&#8221;.</p>
<p>Western Civilization is one of humanity&rsquo;s greatest creations, and it&rsquo;s about time that we start protecting it.</p>

		<p>Say goodbye to the traditional cross on the Swiss army knife. They along with two other Swiss companies who have had the symbol for over 150 yrs have capitulated to this outrageous demand. In turn I should say that all crescent moons should also be banned. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see what is offensive to me being banned in these cave man cultures. Whatever they think it is that gives them a perogative to dictate, I mean, impose their backward values on a higher society will soon find a lot less accomodation I predict. If their brutality of enforcement cannot be controlled they will find themselves in short order ousted from their hosts, and none too soon.</p>

		<p>Muslims can make themselves and everybody else happier by leaving Switzerland and, for that matter, all of Europe.  In an Islamic utopia like Saudi Arabia they don&rsquo;t have to suffer with symbols of Christianity.  Turkey&rsquo;s national flag has an Islamic crescent on it and I&rsquo;ve never heard a Muslim complain about that.<br>

		<p> This has absolutely nothing to do with objections to Christian symbolism. Rather, it&rsquo;s another power grab on the part of Muslims to demonstrate their emerging influence in Switzerland. If the demands of these militant Muslims are placated, they will only become more emboldened with their demands.</p>
<p>The cross should remain specifically because it&rsquo;s Muslims objecting!<br>

<p>I like the 1921 flag. The coat of arms on it has symbols of England, Scotland, Ireland, and France, with a maple sprig underneath the four, suggesting that Canada is descended from those four countries.</p>

<p>Switzerland prospers as a multilingual nation because the federal government in Bern has very few powers   &mdash;   defense, fiscal/monetary policy, mail delivery, but little else. All other authority devolves to the cantons (states) or towns. Our Founding Fathers liked the Swiss system so much that they used it as the basis for our Constitution.</p>

When did this change; to allow these clearly non-Swiss invaders?<br>
Or is it simply another case of non-citizen invaders making the usual demands on the superior culture of their &#8216;adopted&rsquo; host country. (Yes, adopted; like a tapeworm adopts an intestine&hellip;)<br>
Simple solution? <br>
If you aren&rsquo;t (Swiss, American, German, Norwegian etc.) -go back to where you BELONG, and where the laws and customs are suited to your beliefs -because we have about had enough pandering, coddling and destruction of our own Cultures to appease an invasive, parasitic community.</p>

<p>This article doesn&rsquo;t mention nor has anything to do with the Serbs.  As an American of Slovenian descents, I can&rsquo;t believe that you are constantly trying to hijack this American website to propagandize that the Serbs were somehow the victims during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia.  For the record, the Serbs had already stripped Kosovo of its constitutional autonomy since 1989 and were in charge of the Yugoslav army (JNA) that invaded and occupied a 1/3 of Croatia and 3/4 of Bosnia when they declared their independence respectively in 1991 and 1992. Not only that, but the Serbs also attacked Slovenia even though it had no significant Serbian minority there (Ten-Day War), and it was only spared an occupation because it didn&rsquo;t border Serbia like all the others: <a href="http://goo.gl/klCWZ" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/klCWZ</a>  </p>
<p>Furthermore, Serbia itself was never invaded by any troops of the above at anytime whatsoever, and not even by NATO !  Sorry, but the Serbs and their &#8220;Greater Serbia&#8221; have fought against everybody in the Balkans ever since they started against the Bulgarians over Macedonian territories (Second Balkan War) and then assassinated Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand to get their &#8220;Black Hand&#8221; on Bosnian territories in 1914.  Readers of Amren are not some uneducated hillbillies as you might think, and most of us don&rsquo;t fall for &#8220;the enemy of my enemy is my friend&#8221; fallacy.  Milosevic lost, get over it!<br>

<p>Actuallly, back in 1920s, Turkish govt. protested to the Soviet authorities because Armenian flag (Armenia was then a part of the Soviet Union) contains a symbol of sacred mountain Ararat, located in Turkey. Comissary for Foreign Affairs, Chicherin- a Bolshevik originally from aristocratic family tracing their roots back to the Mongol yoke in the 14th century - replied cynically that Turkish flag had a Moon crescent &amp; Turkey had not possessed the planet Moon. End of discussion.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect illustration how the goals of cultural marxists and muslims often align&hellip; removing the cross is a central objective of the left, the ACLU for example, famously sued and pressured LA county to remove a tiny cross (on the sail of a ship) from their county seal. </p>

		<p>A few thoughts.  We hear about Switzerland many times, normally by the anti-war left and Ron Paul, who say the country doesn&rsquo;t see terrorism because it doesn&rsquo;t send its troops into the Middle East.  Regardless of how people feel about the current wars (I for one am for leaving and letting the Muslims figure it out themselves), it appears just being neutral doesn&rsquo;t remove yourself from the Islam problem.  If you show weakness, (normally done by bragging about &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; or &#8220;tolerance&#8221;), they will come and infest your land, even though you didn&rsquo;t invade Muslim lands first.  France didn&rsquo;t play a big role in Afghanistan nor Iraq, but it is worse off than America  &mdash;  namely because it doesn&rsquo;t regulate immigration.  Any foreign policy that does not distinguish between an Islamic world and a Western world is woefully incompatable with the 21st century global politik.</p>
<p>What matters is not when or how we decide to fight wars against aggressors, but that we don&rsquo;t let potential agressors into the country.  9/11 occured ultimately because the terrorists could get in  &mdash;  easily and without suspicion  &mdash;  due to lax border security.  Therefore, any success we ultimately gain in the Middle East will be countered if we won&rsquo;t secure the border.</p>
<p>What is admirable about Switzerland is not its neutrality, but its desire to do what is best for the Swiss.  Unlike the US and the rest of Europe, it appears many in Switzerland understand the rich history and culture of their own society, and believe it is worth defending.  The white sheep kicking out the fourth would never fly in even conservative parts of the US, yet it plays a major role in Swiss politics  &mdash;  as it should. </p>

Milosevic lost, get over it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;I&rsquo;m an American who lived in Slovenia in the late 90s, traveled the Balkans and read a great deal of history on Balkan history and issues.  You didn&rsquo;t mention that most of the Black Hand was made up of Bosnian Serbs, who had enjoyed for example, the Hapsburg suppression of 1878, in which Croatian troops slaughtered them wholesale.  I believe some Catholic Slovenians were in the Austrian army as well. Serbia did lead the charge in ousting the Ottoman Turks from the Balkans in the 19th century. Instead of supporting their Christian brethren, the Hapsburgs made a deal with the Ottoman Turks to suppress Serbia; which they did brutally in 1878 BEFORE the Balkan Wars. 500 years of Ottoman oppression topped off by betrayal topped off by Catholic Croats gleefully joining in to kill Orthodox Serbs.</p>
<p>Readers, Serbs are Orthodox Christians whereas Croats and Slovenes are typically Catholic and allied with Vatican interests both historically and presently.  Croatia was formed of slavs that Rome allowed to settle in exchange for mercenary services.  Croats have historically sided with Hapsburg, Austrian, German, and Nazi interests against Serbia in WW2 formed a fascist force for the Mussolini Catholic force the Ustazi, who provided a period of terrorism and violations and tortures against ALL Yugoslavian partisans that apparently even the German army found repugnant.</p>
<p>Tito&rsquo;s main talent in keeping the peace during post WW2 Yugoslavia was due to his resettlement of different ethnic groups for &#8220;balance.&#8221;  He gave Kosovo its own independent status as a province within Yugoslavia, just like Croatia and Slovenia, and the rest.  He allowed Albanians to move into Kosovo in order to counter the growth of too much national feeling by Serbs in Kosovo. (Kosovo is considered the Serbian Jerusalem due to the 14th century Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Turks).  Marshall Tito, by the way, was an ethnic Croatian.  So after his death and the rising corruption of the last ten years of his life it makes some sense that a new, strong leader would be required.  And since Tito lacked the foresight, or care to groom a successor, Milosevic stepped into the role. Many will go on about how bad he was, and he was, but only Serbia cared about politics.  I can tell you from experience that most &#8220;Yugoslavs&#8221; especially Slovenians (and Croats), are concerned with themselves and living the good life.  Only Serbs have enough political motivation to do ANYTHING.  (Former Yugoslavs seem to all have jokes about how lazy the others are, with Slovenia being more like Austria than like Serbia or even Croatia).</p>
<p>It is a complicated history, and Serbia has not always been the good guy, especially during the Kosovo conflict of 1998-99, which I saw close up, but this self-qualifying Slovenian American is giving out a very biased argument.  The 1990s wars featured Croatian murders who set things off by baiting Bosnian Serbs. Serbia was leading Yugoslavia from Belgrade and after Tito died, individual national animosities had a rebirth, but it is hard to say who was worst between Croatia and Serbia. In a larger sense, you cannot really blame Yugoslavia from using their army to try to hold the country intact. The U.S. did in the 19th century and was willing to fight a bloody civil war over it. </p>
<p>What became well known after 9/11 was that al Queda had a cell in Sarajevo and was working at establishing a power base in Bosnia.  Milosevic used the medieval &#8220;all by ourselves&#8221; solution that reminded Europe of how the Nazis had operated and that was a huge tactical and political mistake.  Most Serbs know this, especially the young.  I know a few students who were out front of his office in Belgrade the day he lost power, shouting for him to give up.  NATO promised as a condition of ending the bombing campaign of 1999 that Kosovo would NOT be allowed to become a sovereign Albanian nation.  The UN recently recognized Kosovo as an independent Albanian dominated nation.  How and why should any troubled nation believe any guarantee by NATO, the UN or anyone?</p>
<p>In Slovenia and everywhere else, the Albanian mafia was always present.  The usual cover was neighborhood produce stands.  There were a number of mafias operating in Slovenia, including the Russian mafia.  It has become very plain today that through NATO and the UN allowing Albanians to dominate Kosovo (destroying nearly all World Culture Heritage Serbian Orthodox churches, all churches), it has become a platform for heroin and organized crime into Europe as well as a spring-point for Islam in Europe.</p>
<p>All of this allows the feelings to remain very bitter in the Balkans.  Catholic Slovene says that we aren&rsquo;t uneducated hillbillies, and he is right.  I hope my post helps for any interested in a fuller view of the real situation.</p>
<p>That Croats would support Albanians in Switzerland, who they have to know represent both organized crimes against Europe of the worst type (banking, drugs, and sex-slavery), just to antagonize Serbia is unconscionable and despicable.  </p>

		<p>If foreign (especially Western) expat enclaves in Muslim countries were demanding that the Muslim nation in question change their flag, there would rightfully be outrage from the Muslims at such arrogance. But why don&rsquo;t Muslims understand that it&rsquo;s equally outrageous to do the same in a Western country? The Muslim definition of respect only goes one way. Given how Muslim culture is incompatible with the West, instead of making these insane demands, they should go back to whichever Muslim country they or their families came from. After all, the Islamic world has all that they desire, right? Sharia law, the freedom to practise Islam all they want, even expat workers and tourists giving respect to their country and customs. It&rsquo;s disgusting that Muslims do not wish to abide by Western customs and laws in Western nations while hypocritically demanding the same respect from other religions/countries/people. </p>

Let me add that the Vatican is no friend of traditional American values, that it was allied with Turkophile Islamophile Nazis &amp; Fascists. Catholic Crusaders sacked Constantinople during the Crusades, the Vatican ordered the German states, Sweden &amp; Poland to attack Russia 5X in the Middle Ages to say nothing of what it morphed into after Vatican II with more Islamophilia &amp; new pedophilia.

<p>&#8220;When I was a kid, it was my understanding that Swiss Citizenship could Only be gained if your Parents were legitimate Swiss Citizens, and you served in the Swiss Army, etc.<br>

<p>From what I understand, Swiss citizenship is still hard to get: much harder than simply migrating to Switzerland. Switzerland has always contained many non-citizens, mostly wealthy European celebrities and businessmen buying second homes near the ski-mountains. They cannot normally vote. </p>
<p>Because Swiss citizenship requires participation for men in the Swiss military or civil service, granting it liberally as in other European countries is presents a direct risk; after active service Swiss reservists are expected to keep an assault rifle in their houses, with ammo, for the next ten years. </p>

<p>During the 90&rsquo;s, [well, ever since WW2]   Switzerland was placed under intense pressure from international groups (always run by the Usual Suspects) to relax its rules, open its borders, and accept more refugees and immigrants. Then more and more concessions;  but nothing was ever enough. </p>
<p>They are under pressure even now from the EU, if they want to have closer relations with EU countries   &mdash;   a matter of vital necessity to them. Tiny Switzerland, without allies,  has held its own bravely, but it is not in a good position to be obstinate to the greater world that surrounds them, so it has had to make concessions.</p>

		<p>I think it is totally outrageous to even suggest a change of flag.People worldwide, irrespective of any affiliation should realise that when emigrating to another country you should unequivocally tolerate if not accept the culture, traditions and general way of life of your chosen adapted country, or else return to where you came from which may well be a country practising far less tolerance if any at all.<br>
Of Swiss origin i too had to accept the laws of my adopted country South africa, when emigrating as a young man. Whether i condoned the laws prevelant then is of no consequence other than my never setting foot in that land, or return to my native country.<br>
So if the swiss democratically decide that minarets, a change of flag or whatever are not acceptable then so be it finish and klaar.<br>
