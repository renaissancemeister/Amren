<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police arrest 15 to 20 middle school students after a brawl at McKinley Foundation Academy in Flint.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Once the fight broke out, students began calling and texting their parents.</p>
<p>Some of the parents became irate when they were not allowed inside the building.</p>
<p>Parents packed the front entrance demanding answers. They had heard about a fight possibly involving weapons and did not know if their children were safe.</p>
<p>One parent kicked the front door while another shouted &#8220;Kick it down!&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another parent called school officials on the phone and said, &#8220;Guess what? You guys are getting sued. We want out kids out now!&#8221;</p>
<p>School leaders called Flint City police for assistance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School leaders locked the building down for a couple hours to restore order leaving the parents outside.</p>

		<p>My grandma grew up in Flint.  She used to say it was a nice place to live until you-know-who showed up.  I&rsquo;ve seen pics of her neighborhood from 50 years ago.  It looked like a nice, clean and safe place back then.</p>

		<p>Yes, Flint, Michigan.  </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that the wonderful town which the foil-headed flake that calls himself a Vice-Messiah said would have more murders and rapes if Obama didn&rsquo;t get his tax increase bill?  Seems like that ship has already sailed.  It almost doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have 20 cops on every corner or every classroom in Flint, blacks are still blacks.</p>
<p>That speaks to a pet peeve of mine, about Democrats and cops.  OT, so I&rsquo;ll just link to it:  <a href="https://goo.gl/jf56g" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/jf56g</a></p>

		<p>Gee.  I wonder where their kids got their behavior from?</p>
<p>Point two.  You can call it an academy, but it&rsquo;s still the usual ghetto inner city behavior from both parents and kids.  Never changes.  Never will.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a middle school, grades 6, 7 and 8. Okay, I get it. The white students are 11, 12 and 13 years old. The African-American students are 17, 18 and 19 or 20 years old. Can we say &#8220;segregate&#8221; yet? There is no way any learning is going on in a &#8220;school&#8221; that is 72.7 percent black and 23 percent white.</p>

		<p>The parents wanted in on the action too. They should have opened those doors for a real battle royale. Weapons? Why don&rsquo;t they have a TSA style pat down with metal detectors?</p>

		<p>I grew up in Flint and attended its public schools and learned about diversity.  With a great deal of help from may black classmates, I was able to overcome the influence of my family and church and learn to stop hating  &mdash;  the K.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just blacks anymore, diversity has mestastasized.  There are now more Latinos in the state than blacks.  Also, Michigan is the Muslim capital of America.</p>

		<p>Some time ago, I had to occasion to do some work in a local inner city school. The physical structure is wonderful. Those who complain that we don&rsquo;t spend enough for education need to look at some of these palaces. Even the schools built between 1900 and 1930 can be made to look wonderful. A lot of them have masonry that you can&rsquo;t get for any price now. However, when you see the kids it is just another reminder of why I live in the boondocks. I can imagine that people who attended this school 50 - 60 years ago just shake their heads in disgust. </p>
<p>One day, not more than five seconds after I walked out of the building to my truck, there was an announcement of a school lock-down. Probably a couple of &#8220;brutha&rsquo;s&#8221; who knocked over a liquor store. They could easily hang out in one of the abandoned homes until the cops went on to the next call. This neighborhood was full of houses that look like those from the Sears catalogs of the early 1900&rsquo;s. A few were clean and tidy, most were just a wreck.  Almost like a slower version of the TV show &#8220;Life after people&#8221;. Or as it should be called, &#8220;Life after white people&#8221;.</p>
<p>My guess as to why any white kids attend this school is that the parents do not have the means to bail out of this area. That was why I was stuck at a 75% black high school many years ago. </p>

		<p>I have to go with the parents on this one. Unless there is an active shooter inside the school the authorities should never have the right to keep parents away from their children. Especially when they are concerned about an incident.  Same for nursing homes keeping kids away from their parents. I pulled up outside my Dad`s one time after hours. The security guard told me it was after 9:00 pm and  asked if I &#8220;had an appointment&#8221;.. I told him that it was MY dad, not his and I would inform him when I needed to see him. I told him to open the gate or for HIM to give me $1500.00 dollars&hellip; He did. Another time another refusal.  I told the guard what the program was and threatened to come back with the heavy dump truck I knew that he knew that I had the keys to. It was not the truck but the resolve in my voice that opened the gate for me.</p>

<p>From my personal unfortunate experiences in middle schools, the limit for &#8220;learning&#8221; is around 2 or 3 black &#8220;students&#8221; per class, let&rsquo;s say 10%.  The saddest part is now the white students consider themselves to be &#8220;n****s&#8221; and act accordingly.</p>

		<p>#11 Unless there is an active shooter inside the school the authorities should never have the right to keep parents away from their children.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t understand.  There WAS one or more suspected shooters hiding out among the students.  The lockdown was to prevent them from shooting anyone else as they made their way out and perhaps catch them., giving them a chance to surrender.</p>
<p>You are thinking like a typical white person.  That these are children and need to be protected.  They are not.  They are as dangerous as any prison population and need to be handled carefully.</p>
<p>Also, the behavior of the &#8220;parents&#8221; has nothing to do with being worried about their kids and everything to do with not getting their way, immediately.</p>

<p>Speaking of Michigan, every car TV ad I have seen for months features a thuggish black man as driver except for the ad with Jennifer Lopez. Even Toyota has an ad with a black thug at the wheel.</p>

		<p>People forget &#8220;crowd&#8221; mentality. Instead of running from a fight or trying to break up a fight, the crowd urges the perpetrators on, even joining in because they have to &#8220;get my cousin&rsquo;s or my brother&rsquo;s or my sister&rsquo;s back&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t matter if they are truly related or not, the fight just escalates with bystanders pushing forward to get a good look. Parents are just as bad as the kids, kicking the doors to make sure their children are safe, my eye. They are just as bad as the kids they are supposed to be roll models for. Lockdowns help to get the kids calmed down and into a safe environment, because many kids are just plain scared, getting them into a classroom or other environment and away from the violence. A responsible adult is with them to comfort and talk to kids. Believe me, the kids NEED this during a scary violent episode, many kids come to school just to feel SAFE. I have no sympathy for parents who do not understand the district&rsquo;s policies to keep kids SAFE, most of the time you never see these parents at school helping out, following the academic progress of their child, but as soon as something happens they all have to &#8220;get in on&#8221; it. Parents, teach your kids basic manners and how to deal with life rationally. Part of the problem is that some kids use aggression to deal with problems, this I believe, they learn from home. The apple doesn&rsquo;t fall far from the tree.</p>

<p>But, Jennifer Lopez LOVES blacks. She does not like Whites. I saw her one night flipping through the channels on George Lopez. She made a very racist anti-White comment while the stupid audience clapped like crazy, and after that I cannot stand to see that woman. </p>
