			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Miller, Daily Mail (London), October 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than 200 UK-based terrorists are currently plotting to carry out suicide bombing attacks in Britain and are likely to strike during next year&rsquo;s London Olympics intelligence chiefs have warned.</p>
<p>Government ministers have been briefed on the threat by senior intelligence officers from MI5 and MI6 who claim the figure is a &#8216;conservative estimate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The information is said to be part of a secret government report on the enduring threat from Al-Qaeda and other Islamic terrorist organisations</p>
<p>It is estimated there are 2000 extremists based in Britain currently planning some kind of terrorist activity.</p>
<p>Despite the recent deaths of Al- Qaeda chiefs Osama bin Laden and Anwar al-Awalki, security services say the organisation remains as dangerous a threat as ever. </p>
<p>Intelligence chiefs say there is little the authorities can do to prevent a well-organised attack by a terrorist cell.</p>
<p>One intelligence officer told the Sunday Telegraph: &#8216;We may have only had one &#8216;successful&rsquo; suicide attack in Britain but the tactic remains an enduring threat. </p>
<p>&#8216;This is a generational problem we are facing. The terrorists are learning all the time and adapting their tactics. They now operate a cell structure and there security is very tight.</p>
<p>&#8216;Suicide bombers know the signs we will be looking for. So they don&rsquo;t pray in the moments before an attack, there will be no heavy coats in summer and they are becoming much more security aware. </p>
<p>&#8216;For every countermeasure we develop they create a new &#8216;measure&rsquo;. </p>
<p>&#8216;They will always be looking for our exposed flank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>MI5 has described next year&rsquo;s Olympics as the biggest security operation in Britain&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>It is feared extremists will avoid targeting the sporting venues where security will be high and instead attack public areas like tube and train stations.</p>
<p>Security experts believe they may adopt the deadly tactic used in foreign countries where explosive vests are packed with hundreds of ball-bearings and detonated in crowded areas.</p>
<p>It is estimated that by using this tactic a bomber could kill up to 20 people in a suicide attack.</p>
<p>On 7 July 2005 52 people were killed and over 700 injured when four British terrorists detonated suicide bombs on the London underground and a double-decker bus.</p>
<p>The bombs used were homemade, peroxide-based devices which had been packed into rucksacks. </p>
<p>Two weeks later a second series of bombings on the London transport network failed when only the detonators of the home-made explosives went off.</p>
<p>Muktar Ibrahim, 29, Yassin Omar, 26, Ramzi Mohammed, 25, and Hussain Osman, 28, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and were each sentenced to a minimum of 40 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</p>
<p>Documents published by the WikiLeaks website suggested MI6 officers are now bracing themselves for a further wave of suicide bombings.</p>
<p>One report, which quotes a security officer&rsquo;s briefing to U.S. intelligence services, reads: &#8216;The internal threat is growing more dangerous because some extremists are conducting non-lethal training without ever leaving the country.</p>
<p>&#8216;Should these extremists then decide to become suicide operatives.. intelligence resources, eaves dropping and surveillance would be hard pressed to find them on any radar screen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two weeks ago six men for Birmingham were remanded in custody over an alleged suicide bombing plot.</p>
<p>Two of the men, Irfan Nasser and Irfan Khalid have been accused of planning to make home-made explosives and stating their intentions to be suicide bombers.</p>
<p>They are also accused of travelling to Pakistan to receive training, making martyrdom videos and plotting a bombing campaign.</p>

		<p>Maybe it would finally bomb some sense into the British people.  But I know that even if they killed a thousand people it wouldn&rsquo;t change anything, the powers that be will still go on importing Muslims and other non-whites.  The elite share the same enemy as the Islamic terrorists, they both are working for the destruction of the British nation and people.  They&rsquo;re mainly bothered by the PR problems such bombings make for multiculturalism, and their chief concern after such bombings is to prevent &#8220;vigilantism&#8221; and a backlash against immigration.</p>

		<p>This is how multiculturalism dies, with one culture brutally killing off another.  That those in Britain and the rest of us in the White world have brought this on ourselves will result in one of two things: 1) The White world will reach a point of total destruction at some future time, or 2) Whatever White civilization survives will use examples such as this to maintain a unicultural and White-race based society.</p>

		<p> This is such baloney with inflated numbers just so they can strip more rights from us due to a fear mentality. All they need do is simply deport the muslims back to their native lands and we would have darn few suicide bombers. That&rsquo;s the solution that makes the most sense but that would limit governmental power.</p>

<p>And the blithering idiots responsible for importing these people into the country haven&rsquo;t let up one iota in their unrelenting quest to create &#8220;diversity,&#8221; tax units, and consumers. </p>
<p>In addition to the terroristic threats, the newcomers get a handsome social benefit package every month, in spite of the fact that Britain is slowly going broke.</p>
<p>Such judgement, wisdom and common sense can only be found in the asylums for the criminally insane.</p>

		<p>The penalty for these jihadists the British security and military forces capture should be hanging, with the noose greased in pork fat. Frankly, I think it&rsquo;s time for the West to grow a pair and expel all Muslims by force and ban Islam in their borders. If they use a nuclear bomb or other device of mass destruction against a western nation, I think Mecca and Medina should be destroyed by nuclear devices airburst above them for maximum death and destruction in return.</p>

<p>One word solves the whole problem:</p>
<p>Deportation.</p>
<p>If the M.I.-fill in the blank agencies know who they are, why not pass the information on to the cops and bobbies so they can all be arrested?  I&rsquo;m sure they have already committed plenty of crimes, because after all, there are so many ways for white Britons to become &#8220;criminals&#8221; that I&rsquo;m sure these &#8220;secret&#8221; terror cell people have also violated these laws.  Hell, the UK still won&rsquo;t let in the American talk radio host born Michael Alan Weiner, even though he&rsquo;s far from a terrorist, and, as we all know from the e-mail exchange he initiated with someone at AR, (see this:  <a href="/" rel="nofollow">/news/2008/09/michael_savage.php)</a> Weiner is a multiracialist at heart.</p>

		<p>Prior to World War Two it was few Englishman that had ever SEEN a dark skinned person much less had those persons from the colonies living among them. Those persons let into England were brought in to do menial labor, work in the textile mills, etc.</p>
<p>And all this info came out as a result of wikileaks? What ever approach and understanding the security services had in mind is now out in the open for the terrorists to scrutinize? Well, great!!</p>

		<p>Many years ago, I read an info piece from an alcoholic aid organization. The gist was that alcoholics often focus on the effects of their self-destructive behavior, while ignoring the addiction that is the cause. For example they complain about decaying personal relationships, lack of respect from family and friends, work difficulties, health problems, etc., ignoring or minimizing the effects of their alcohol consumption</p>
<p>I think that this article describes an analogous situation: the U.K.government is focusing on the destructive effects of its immigration policies, while ignoring the immigration policies that are causing these problems.</p>

		<p>Does anyone doubt that the UK will be the FIRST nation to totally collapse? They are the most politically correct place in the world and that fact, IMO, means they are &#8220;numero uno&#8221; on the list. I mean its not like they are going to remove from their nation these people who are planning their destruction. That would be racist. </p>

		<p>Anger over this situation is properly directed at the &#8220;multiculturalists&#8221; responsible for shipping these maniacs into Britain by the millions. </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the fault of everyday Britons who &#8220;allowed this to happen&#8221; and therefore &#8220;deserve to die&#8221; at the hands of lunatics. The people of Great Britain are murder victims. </p>

<p>During WWII, the Russians came up with the idea of strapping explosives to dogs, and training them to run under German tanks. Trouble was, they didn&rsquo;t have any captured German tanks to train the dogs with, so they just substituted Russian tanks. </p>
<p>You can probably guess what happened the first time their &#8220;secret weapon&#8221; was deployed.  &#8221; <i>NYET! NYET!</i> Run OTHER WAY!&#8221;<br>

		<p>The term &#8220;false positive&#8221; is relevant here perhaps.  Of every<br>
five bona fide suspected bombers, there will likely be two additional Caucasian-appearing  &#8220;false positives&#8221; who are guilty of nothing other than reading and whispering about the wrong books, attending the wrong Conferences, etc.    Terrorism fighting terrorism.   </p>

		<p>Hey, England. How&rsquo;s that Diversity working out over there? You must be so proud of what you have achieved over the last 50 years. </p>
<p>If you want to clean house of the Muslim maniacs, then unleash the SAS, and let them do what they do best. </p>
<p>After that, deport what&rsquo;s left, and never allow them to return, or you can suffer the same fate, again. You&rsquo;re choice, of course.</p>

<p>America is in far worse demographic shape than the UK any European country.  We will be the first historically white country to go minority white.  </p>

Whatever premature misdirections this dog &#8220;suicide bomber&#8221; training had, I believe eventually they did get the nose turned in the right direction.  And apparently we&rsquo;ve been into getting dolphins  trained to be very lethal instruments of delivery. Not exactly a child&rsquo;s circus.     </p>
