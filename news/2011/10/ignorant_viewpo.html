			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial Board, Highland Cavalier, October 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Today we published a potentially controversial advertisement. The ad, on page 5, says simply, &#8220;Is diversity a strength? We think not. For an alternative view: www.AmRen.com.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ad was paid for by the New Century Foundation, a nonprofit organization that publishes the monthly magazine American Renaissance. The website mentioned in the ad is for the magazine.</p>
<p>Both the organization and publication are, by any objective standard, representative of a white supremacist viewpoint.</p>
<p>As an editorial board, we debated whether or not to accept and publish New Century&rsquo;s ad. The content of the ad is not inappropriate itself, we thought. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We vehemently disagree with New Century&rsquo;s cause. Diversity is a strength. Our nation, our community and our college are all built on it. We believe the organization&rsquo;s beliefs are incorrect and even crude. They are, and certainly should be, unpopular.</p>
<p>The question we asked ourselves, then, was: Should opinions be rejected merely because they&rsquo;re unpopular? If we brush ugly views to the side and don&rsquo;t discuss what makes them wrong, how do we learn from them?</p>
<p>In the end, most of us felt that hiding New Century&rsquo;s ad because it espouses white supremacist views doesn&rsquo;t serve our purpose, which is in part to serve as a conduit for discussion of issues that affect us as a college community.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We encourage you to visit amren.com and read what the group has to say. Discuss it with your peers, professors and others in the community. Talk about how it makes you feel and think about why diversity is a strength.</p>
<p>As always, feel free to contact us or write a letter to the editor with your comments and critiques of our decision. {snip}</p>
<p><br>

		<p>Most of the college students won&rsquo;t understand affirmative action until they work for a minority, after they notice the other minorities receiving promotions or good evaluations it&rsquo;ll sink in.  As far as the &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; ploy, research why and how past great civilizations fell, Rome, Macedon, currently Britain.  Look at crime statistics for our most diverse cities, then you&rsquo;ll see the facts; where there is blacks and latinos, crime is much higher, and people expect not to work while still receiving welfare.  Inner city schools get more money and have less graduation, but no one can figure out why; cause blacks and latinos don&rsquo;t want to learn. I&rsquo;ll stop now or I&rsquo;ll spend all on this one subject.<br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s an old intemperate phrase that goes, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t defecate where you eat.&#8221;  Actually, it doesn&rsquo;t say quite that, but you get the point.</p>
<p>The NCF was nice enough to take a printed ad out in your printed paper, I&rsquo;m sure you could desperately use the money, and all you can do is bash the advertiser?</p>
<p><i>Diversity is a strength.</i></p>
<p>Again, explain to me why or how, and do so without merely defining diversity.</p>
<p>Also, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice the title of JT&rsquo;s new video.  Yes, it is a takeoff on the old &#8220;Question Authority&#8221; bumper stickers.  I got the idea to start using &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221; as a screen name because I saw a hippiemobile with the bumper stickers &#8220;Question Authority&#8221; and &#8220;Honor Diversity&#8221; next to each other.  I did the simple transposition of words, because questioning diversity IS questioning authority.</p>

		<p>The US Supreme Court has ruled that protected (free) speech is necessarily unpopular speech. Popular speech needs no protection. Unpopular viewpoints may later become popular, but not if they are blocked or censored or disallowed. If an unpopular viewpoint is so potent and threatening that others must seek to stop it before others can hear it, I say we NEED very much to hear this unpopular speech&hellip;.and maybe make it popular indeed. The truth is unafraid of all viewpoints but the deception and the lie is fragile and fearful of being upset or exposed.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the scariest statement.  It has Orwellian overtones.  &#8220;Ugly&#8221;, &#8220;wrong&#8221;.  Thanks for making up the minds of your own before they have a chance to go to the site(s) and determine for themselves what they may think.  </p>

		<p>European diversity worked.  Asian diversity in the West worked out too fairly well I believe.  Both groups seem quite capable of integrating into Western society.  As for Black and Hispanic diversity being a &#8220;strength&#8221;, why don&rsquo;t the people who constantly repeat this mantra move to Detroit and prove that?</p>

<p>Is that some school in the old confederacy? Sounds like it. How the south has fallen. Such pompous nonsense.  No different from 20 years ago when I was in college. Same old same old.</p>
<p>Wait till they try to get a job.  Or live with a diverse roommate who brings a lot of diverse roommates over including a rapist murderer.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how this article can claim that diversity is a strength. They obviously don&rsquo;t understand history.</p>
<p>Whenever you put people of different cultures, races, ethnicities, religions, etc. together there is ALWAYS conflict and, unfortunately, many times bloodshed. Differences tend to do this even within the same races and ethnicities, but it is worse when there are differing races and ethnicities because many of them have historical racial grievances that are nursed and that they will never go beyond.</p>
<p>I have noticed since America has increased its diversity from Third World countries, our country is broken, in conflict, and divisive. There are unending accusations of racism and discrimination.</p>
<p>I would rather live in peace.</p>

		<p>If this awakens even one person it&rsquo;ll have been worth it. Someone reading this must have a lingering doubt as to why certain minorities fail as a group. All I can say is read up. I certainly didn&rsquo;t stumble onto AmRen with the opinions I currently hold. This website helped, but more important was my own research. Read up on the facts yourself, blank slate, do not think about how you would like things, only how they are. Utilizing logic, you&rsquo;ll realize why we here at AmRen think the way we do. </p>
<p>Remember that while we can tell you how blacks have an average IQ of 85, we cannot tell you all blacks have an IQ of 85. Same goes for whites at 100 or asians at 106. We only talk about such numbers not because we swell up with pride for our race, but because they explain the social and economic inequities between the races. Ockham&rsquo;s razor seems to be applied everywhere but race.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Ignorant&rdquo; is a dated word used against those people who recognize biological differences between groups by observing human interactions and exercising the former sciences of &ldquo;sociology&rdquo; or &ldquo;anthropology&rdquo;. This editorial board is behind the times. The casual observer knows that the identifier &ldquo;Ignorant&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;Hateful&rdquo; in the 1990s, only to be recently replaced again by &ldquo;Scared&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But the person who is concerned about the consequences of the demographic future of his country is usually not &ldquo;Ignorant&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hateful&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scared&rdquo;. I think a more accurate identifier would be &ldquo;Objective&rdquo;. Those other words often seem to be Freudian projection on the part of the people who seem to gain so much self-affirmation by using them.</p>

		<p>Those who maintain that diversity is valuable need to go beyond feel good rhetoric and examine the results.<br>
 <br>
When white Europeans, whites of European descent, the upper stratum of India, and Orientals interact the results can be positive. These are racial groups who have practiced urban civilization for several thousand years, and agriculture for thousands of years more. <br>
 <br>
When whites interact with racial groups closer in number of generations to a paleolithic existence, and when these less evolved racial groups interact with each other, the results are frequently negative.<br>
 <br>
The Arabs were once creators of a great civilization. Unfortunately, they never really recovered from the Mongolian conquests of the thirteenth century. The religion that unites them has become a force for intolerance and obscurantism. </p>

		<p>The continued false statement that This Nation was founded on diversity must be met with truth at every opportunity.  The preamble to the constitution, every immigration law up until 1965, and just about every politician up until the modern era have been implicitly or explicitly pro European majority. </p>

Stuff like this is better than nothing, and is even necessary, but we must not fool ourselves; it&rsquo;s very easy for people to ignore bumper-sticker type arguments, especially from extremists like us. The average UVA student who watched that video rolled his eyes, and thought one of two things: &#8216;Just another reactionary who doesn&rsquo;t understand that progress takes time.&rsquo; or &#8216;Yeah maybe, I guess, nothing to get to worked up about, I&rsquo;m not really planning on living in the ghetto anyways.&rsquo; I think the argument that diversity is code for anti-white, that it&rsquo;s only white countries that are being forced to embrace potential minority status in their own homelands, etc. would get people thinking a little more, but even still many would say, &#8216;So what, that&rsquo;s actually what makes us better.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Ultimately, we have to convince people of the moral superiority of ethnic nationalism vis-a-vis egalitarian universalism. There is such an argument, on realist and idealist grounds, but the curious first-time visiter does not have time for it, and mainstream newspapers don&rsquo;t have the space for it. So AmRen must make do with videos like this, a few viewers will read more, and some will even be converted, but most of the onus is on us readers to make our case to friends and family.</p>

<p>The article refers to &#8220;we&#8221; editorially but obviously it&rsquo;s one person, probably a male. Such ignorance is absolutely amazing, but even more amazing is the fact that this dork isn&rsquo;t even aware that inundating the country with divisive elements was a plan to fractionalize the country so no single group was dominant, and the method used to repel rightful, natural opposition to it was a process of brainwashing, declaring it was good (diversity is our strength) and shouting anyone down who doesn&rsquo;t like it as haters.</p>
<p>Also, as is quite evident in the writing of this pitiful, brainwashed fool, such brainwashing includes demonizing anyone who wants to be a separatist&hellip;..and no straddling of the fence either. He and his zombie co-horts MUST have a full 100% acceptance completely of this skewed, radical leftist hogwash.  They&rsquo;ll tolerate nothing less.</p>
<p>Note the close-minded comments advising the lemmings to think about how diversity is a strength.  This pitiful moron is completely unaware he&rsquo;s being a close-minded bigot far greater than anyone he&rsquo;s criticizing.</p>
<p>His parents, if they have an ounce of sense, should demand his tuition back, because the school&rsquo;s obvious purpose is social engineering in place of education, and they&rsquo;ve caught this fool, hook, line and sinker.  It&rsquo;s truly disgusting. </p>
<p>I have very little respect&hellip;if any at all&hellip;for mind-numbed university fools who are too weak-minded to resist mind-control.</p>

		<p>The fact that they wrung their hands over whether to run this benign ad says a lot.  First, they must ask themselves why Amren <br>
not only exists, but is supported.  That initial gut reaction they had to not run the ad is typical (in certain circles of effectively conditioned individuals). Most people from spheres like theirs wouldn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d object to it and not run the ad which effectively stifles any discussion or debate.  This is a common response (again, in certain circles, particularly that of academia) and is precisely one of the reasons why Amren exists.  Our viewpoints are not included in what people like to call &#8220;diversity&#8221;, which is a context dependent term.  </p>
<p>What kind of diversity are we talking about? It probably refers to racial diversity, and I&rsquo;ll get to that, but it also refers to diversity of thought, which is by and large not what people mean when they speak of &#8220;diversity&#8221;, they simply mean racial diversity. Yet, why I&rsquo;m here and support Amren is that I value diversity of thought.  I personally object to censorship and the stifling of opposing viewpoints which is how I first came to look into Amren to see what they were about. I didn&rsquo;t let media outlets which appeared to be merely recycling SPLC propaganda scare me off, scare me into not investigating alternative viewpoints. If it isn&rsquo;t fear then what is it in their case?  What explains their ignorance of Amren? Is it that the media have given them an excuse to be intellectually lazy, an excuse to bask in their own unchallenged intellectual supremacy? Who are the supremacists in this scenario? </p>
<p>If Amren is supremacist, then every ethnocentric minority group, special interest or advocacy group in this entire country is racist and or supremacist as well. Is the NAACP supremacist?  Is NCLR supremacist? Is the Asian Pacific Congressional Caucus <br>
supremacist? Is the Arab American Institute supremacist? Is the Black Congressional Caucas supremacist?  The list goes on and <br>
on&hellip;there are hundreds, possibly thousands of these types of organizations and not a single, officially recognized and accepted interest/advocacy group for whites. ZERO.  Let me say that again&hellip;ZERO.</p>
<p>Would they please explain to us why they think that is and if they don&rsquo;t think pervasive anti-white racism is the cause please indicate why they don&rsquo;t believe this is the case.   </p>
<p>The only difference between Amren and these other &#8216;acceptable&rsquo; ethnocentric interest/advocacy groups is that most of us are white and Amren publishes stories and opinions from a white perspective and that are of interest to whites. That is <br>
the ONLY difference - that we are by and large white. These others groups are pursuing their enthnocentric interests (free from accusations of racism and supremacist, a lot of them get funding and recognition from the government!) and so are we (without taxpayer funding mind you!). Please explain to me how this amounts to racism on our part or again could even remotely qualify as supramecy. </p>
<p>In the context of myself, as a white person, how do I personally benefit from diversity?  It seems to me the &#8220;benefit&#8221; of American-style diversity is that I don&rsquo;t get a say.  I get to be discriminated against by Affirmative Action policies and yet, although the government classifies me as a &#8220;Caucasian&#8221; for purposes of discriminating against me, I&rsquo;m not allowed to have a Caucasian interest/advocacy group of my own that advocates for me!? That says &#8220;Hey, U.S. government, why are we still pretending that Affirmative Action isn&rsquo;t institutionalized racism? Why is racial discrimination still acceptable in this country as long as it&rsquo;s only directed at whites?&#8221;  I have no one in government that will represent me in this concern. Is diversity a strength&hellip;for me?  I&rsquo;d ask the paper to come up with one single example of how diversity directly, personally benefits me as a white individual.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, as the paper has also demonstrated, our critics do not actually know what we talk about here, refuse to allow us to debate them openly (typically), and smear us as supremacists because they googled &#8220;Amren&#8221; and noticed the SPLC says it is white supremacist so they mindlessly, uncritically accept this smear as god&rsquo;s truth, and cannot provide actual demonstrative evidence of supramecism (because you&rsquo;d have to actually read Amren to do that) to back up their smears.  </p>
<p>Please, by all means they should scour this site for the &#8220;supremacy&#8221; they think exists here.  Show me where I&rsquo;m wrong! I can tell them that only people I personally dislike are journalists that keep repeating the same ignorant lies about us over and over!  Whatever happened to fact checking in <br>
journalism? Who knows.  Apparently for them, that process stops at the SPLC&rsquo;s website which is curious because when you&rsquo;re reporting on something, shouldn&rsquo;t you have direct knowledge of it?  Here&rsquo;s a tip: The SPLC was never appointed the official moral compass of America. They may think it has the last and final say, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it true.  </p>
<p>Also when they refer to &#8220;ignorant viewpoints&#8221;, as they did in the title of their article, are they referring to us?  Because ignorance is defined as a state of being uninformed. I have to wonder if I seem uninformed to them?  We&rsquo;re well aware over here, it&rsquo;s their paper that has demonstrated ignorance of us and what Amren is really about. That&rsquo;s the only ignorance that exists here.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so incredibly arrogant, considering their complete ignorance, that they would call Amren &#8220;supremacist&#8221; before bothering to ask &#8220;Hey, what are you guys actually about?&#8221; Give Jared an interview! Are you journalists or a paper posing as a smear campaign? Prove you&rsquo;re not just the latter. I invite them to ask us to share our views and debate them as often as they&rsquo;d like. I&rsquo;d like nothing more than that.</p>

<p>Well, &#8220;by any objective standard&#8221;, those holding a &#8220;white supremacist viewpoint&#8221; would somehow advocate that whites are, um, well, uhhh &hellip;. supreme.</p>
<p>But there is an awful lot of racial realist and HBD literature - quoted here - that point-blank says that (as compared to whites) Asians have higher IQs, and at least the Ashkenazi Jews, if not other type of Jews as well.</p>

<p>Asian diversity in the West worked out? For who? The White Greedy Liberal Cheating Class obviously. Asians in our America are actively participating in the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White American engineering, medical, scientific and technological experience-future generations included-Native Born White American variety. This, is most definitely is in the realm of genocide. If you want to be among Asians..pack your bags and go live in China, India, Pakistan or Korea..don&rsquo;t impose Asia on the rest of us.</p>
<p>To the college kids: ask your cool and hip college professors why they don&rsquo;t live in Newark NJ or Hempstead Long Island which have been massively blessed by nonwhite diversity? Another thing to think about: why would you want to deprive millions of Native Born White Americans the enormous benefit of a severe labor scarcity that would be a direct consequence of shutting off all non white legal immigration-down to 0? Why are you in favor of the Liberal White Greedy Cheating Class stealing the trillions in wages from millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans..which they are able to do through the importation of Asian, Muslim and Hispanic scab labor? Ask your really cool and hip professors this question.</p>

<p>I have no doubt about the integrity of the well-discussed and well-argued viewpoints of Amren. </p>
<p>My only question is:  should the student body, after discussing Amren, make up their minds that Amren is correct, will the student newspaper be civilized and agree to disagree, or will it go on the attack and try to rid the campus of controversial thoughts?  </p>

		<p>Ignorant viewpoints, White supremacist, vehemently disagree, incorrect or even crude, unpopular, ugly views. Wrong. Such a long list of negativity in such a short promo is generally quite indicative of a mind ruled by emotion rather than reason. It was minds ruled by emotion rather than reason that countenanced people being burned at the stake for their beliefs. On a superficially emotional level, the writer truly believes this is the way it should and must be, but at a deeper level doubts and contradictions lurk, hence a defensive and obstinate front. Such processes are usually found in the most fundamentalist of diverse religions and I have always maintained multiculturalism and diversity proponents are of the same cut with their own high priest, chants and sacraments.  </p>

		<p>How is diversity a strength.  Or put another way, what specific behaviors do non-whites engage in that are an advantage to whites?  What problematic behaviors do they engage in?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll answer that.  Non-whites hate whites and there is no rational observation of benefit to their existence in our lands whatsoever.  You can readily observe the hatred.  And it is only with great difficulty and leaps of drivel and fast talking that one pretend there are any advantages.</p>
<p>What does the term, ignorance mean?  It means, as opposed to being stupid, or uneducated, the person is stubbornly ignoring what can readily be observed.  So what behaviors are &#8220;rednecks&#8221; stubbornly ignoring, even lying about?  None.  But what about the liberals?  Are those who espouse the &#8220;joys of diversity&#8221; willfully ignoring certain behaviors?  Yes&hellip;the fact that non-whites, rape, rob, murder, assault, steal from, and parasitize our societies via abuse of welfare.  Also, the tremendous degenerate behavior they engage in&hellip;.prostitution, slavery (especially slavery of children), drugs, gangs, out of wedlock births.  All manner of mayhem, mischief and let&rsquo;s be direct and to the point about it&hellip;.evil.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s liberals that are ignorant. And we need to be more direct with them about what the term, ignorance, means, define it.  More to the point, not to tolerate it.  Liberals are not engaging in argument here&hellip;but in bad behavior.  That should consequences&hellip;.fear.  Stigmatization, assault, loss of job, loss of place in community.  In other words, you think my &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is ignorant?  Then you are not allowed to live in my white neighborhood and should be forced to live in Detroit&hellip;.shot if you attempt to leave.</p>
<p>Try ignoring that.</p>

		<p>*Ultimately we published the advertisement, but decided to donate the money New Century will pay us to the Virginia chapter of the NAACP.</p>
<p>So they decided to donate the money to a &#8220;black supremacist&#8221; group - the NAACP! To them, Amren is a &#8220;White supremacist&#8221; group while the NAACP is considered a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; organization even though both are just looking out for the rights of &#8220;their&#8221; people. So I guess it would only be fair if the NAACP ran an ad that they should donate that money to Amren - right?</p>
<p>*Diversity is a strength. Our nation, our community and our college are all built on it.</p>
<p>I personally think that &#8220;diversity&#8221; creates adversity. Our nation, our communities and our colleges were built and were considered first rate the world over long before we had the &#8220;strength&#8221; of diversity. Statistics prove that any nation, community or college that has a lot of diversity also have more  crime, are not as well maintained and have a lot of infighting amongst the various groups. Can any of these diversity lovers name any place on earth that IMPROVED after Whites moved out and blacks/non-Whites moved in? Do they really think that Detroit, E. St Louis, Zimbabwe or South Africa got better after Whites left? Diversity also means that White European culture and White peoples rights are ALWAYS compromised in favor of non Whites. How many colleges\corporations permit - and even encourage - non-Whites to form organizations to look out for their interests, but yet refuse Whites that same right.</p>
<p>I will give the Highland Cavalier credit for at least having an open mind instead of just shutting\shouting down any opinions that they don&rsquo;t agree with.      </p>

		<p>I invite any of the brainwashed readers of the Highland Cavalier to come right here and explain to us how diversity is a strength.  At best, diversity is neutral.  At its worse, it leads to civil war and genocide.  When Jared Taylor debated Peter March on this very issue, Peter March didn&rsquo;t even <i>try</i> to show that diversity is a strength.  All he did was sound morally outraged and insist that diversity is a cross that we wicked, wicked white folk must bear.<br>

		<p>I have yet to find an advocate for diversity that can explain how diversity is a strength.  Some use the lame &#8220;ethnic food&#8221; or &#8220;music&#8221; as examples.  Most others ignore the question outright and predictably resort to name-calling.  The fact that they can&rsquo;t explain diversity&rsquo;s strengths leads one to believe that deep down inside, even THEY don&rsquo;t believe it.  They simply parrot what they think their peers believe because they don&rsquo;t want to be shunned by the group, never realizing that many of their peers also question the the validity of diversity being a strength but are likewise too afraid to speak out.  In other words, they go along to get along.</p>

		<p>Here are my two big reasons for dissenting from the diversity program. </p>
<p>The science supporting it has been found bogus. There are many instances of premeditated fraud. Some really big names in sociology and anthropology have been found guilty. Yet the diversity program goes on. The political force driving the program calls itself liberal. What kind of liberal is it that loses respect for science? So something else beside liberalism has to explain the success of the diversity program. What would that be? There is the possibility that diversity defenders have been trapped by some weird of decadent trend; or perhaps they have been recruited onto one side of a social battle.  </p>
<p>I came into the white movement out of the environmental movement. Even if you disagree that there is a crisis, you must concede that an environmental movement could succeed even if there were no crisis. What would be the successful elements of the movement? Critical mass, leaders, money, access to media, and maybe most importantly, group interaction leading to solidarity, reciprocity,  and trust.  The last point is proving to be difficult in the modern world. The very last thing I would allow is a tangled mess of tribal fighting. This is not how you get everyone together to achieve environmental goals.</p>

		<p>Notice the standard default position of praising &#8220;diversity,&#8221; loudly declaring it a strength (as if this is somehow self-evident) and then swiftly moving on without even the most superficial attempt to quantify their claims. In fact, in all my racially-awakened years I have never yet heard anyone explain how &#8220;diversity&#8221; is a strength or why! Of course I haven&rsquo;t, because they cannot - as it is NOT! Simply repeating their favorite mantra doesn&rsquo;t make it so.</p>
<p>If you happen to enjoy co-habitating with non-Whites for whatever reason, I suppose that is your business. But stop pretending it is some glorious benefit to the rest of us - it isn&rsquo;t! It never was, nor will it ever be. <br>

		<p>Wise, Va., just a few miles from where the incomparable Stanley Brothers were born and raised.</p>
<p>And U.Va., my own alma mater! You kiddies in Wise are breaking your old Uncle Pen&rsquo;s heart!</p>
<p>Do you kiddies like diversity? Well your old Uncle Pen likes diversity too! He especially likes Mexico, where he hangs out in villages and small towns when he has the chance.</p>
<p>And since he likes diversity, your Uncle Pen is pro-White, and not anti-White like those who guide you at UVa in Wise and who want to destroy diversity!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>The anti-Whites who guide you don&rsquo;t believe in the Theory of Evolution. That&rsquo;s right too! They don&rsquo;t accept that theory&rsquo;s fundamental tenet that separation is what creates diversity, separation is what maintains diversity, and ending separation is what destroys diversity. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all the explanation I should need to give you kiddies, but since college ain&rsquo;t what it used to be back when I graduated from U.Va. in the mid 1960s, your old Uncle Pen will explain it to you.</p>
<p>Consider a group of animals selected randomly from the same species, and let half of them wander into a very different environment from the other half and let both groups stay in their respective environments for many thousands of years. The differing pressures from their two distinct environments will select different traits that will come to distinguish one group from the other. The two groups will have genetically diverged from each other, just as Whites diverged in northern climes from Blacks left behind in tropical Africa, and just as different varieties of white-tailed deer have evolved in response to differing environments in the valleys of the Smoky Mountains.</p>
<p>Bring all those varieties of white tailed deer together in one valley, and they will interbreed and soon there will be only one variety of white-tailed deer. No more diversity.</p>
<p>Similarly with non-Whites and Whites. Put them in the same country and remove the barriers between them, and they will interbreed until eventually there is just one race. No more diversity.</p>
<p>We see this in progress today&hellip;how many of you, even in the areas you live in, know a family that has mixed children somewhere in it today? </p>
<p>That same process that is underway here was long ago completed in Mexico between the Spanish conquistadores and the Indian peoples they found there, producing the mestizo race that inhabits Mexico today. No more diversity in Mexico.</p>
<p>This is for real, kiddies. This is really happening. The U.S. and all the other formerly white countries of the world are being purposefully flooded by non-Whites, and the result will be the elimination of the White race. The purposeful elimination of a race by any means is designated by the U. N. as genocide. </p>
<p>The anti-Whites who guide you call themselves anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White, and the program they support is White Genocide.</p>
<p>Anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White.</p>

<p>Then I would inform the editorial board that the motto of La Raza is: &#8220;For the Race, everything, for those outside the Race, nothing&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, I would inform the editorial board that La Raza receives, annully, millions of taxpayer dollars from the federal government.</p>
<p>Next, I would explain to these people that Whites are only about 7% of the population of the world, a very small minority and that they should do what the environmental activist bumper sticker admonishes them to do, namely: THINK GLOBALLY, ACT LOCALLY.</p>

It was only after they managed to kick the undesirable whites out &amp; under stringent Chinese policies that they are today on the verge of being the next greatest superpower of all time beating the United States. Whites were a bane. Ditto for another very great ancient civilization - India. After the Brits were kicked out, despite it&rsquo;s problems India has done much better comparatively. As for Singapore - its the world&rsquo;s cleanest, technologically proficient &amp; a nation which is near perfect especially after the high IQ Han Chinese &amp; Southern Indians (Tamils) took over and created the most perfect nation on Earth - zero poverty, near zero crime rate and 100% literacy rate. Singapore is a 1st world hi tech nation which exhibits prosperity, high quality lifestyles and efficiency to it&rsquo;s best!</p>

		<p>37:</p>
<p>Jew Among You recently had a conversation about this at his blog.  One of his regulars, who might be a regular here, said that he has heard the diversitarians trot out these two canards when asked why/how/where is ODIOUS (Our DIversity Is Our Strength):</p>
<p>1. Because the world is diverse, the country and corporate America needs to be diverse in order to market to the world.</p>
<p>My answer:  That&rsquo;s circular logic. And it really doesn&rsquo;t do anything more than define diversity.</p>
<p>2. Racial diversity brings new perspectives.</p>
<p>My answer: Again, that just defines diversity. We know what it is, we&rsquo;re all grownups with three digit IQs.</p>
<p>Someone else at J.A.Y. brought up a great point - The left keeps saying ODIOUS, but then (properly, IMHO) blame the European colonial artificial borders left in place for Africa&rsquo;s civil wars.  Spot the contradiction - Diversity is supposed to be &#8220;our&#8221; strength when the diversity is racial, but it can&rsquo;t be Rwanda&rsquo;s or Nigeria&rsquo;s strength when the &#8220;country&#8221; has various kinds of black people.</p>

		<p>Lindsey Weiss Amren is NOT about White supremecy. Most every poster here will agree Asian&rsquo;s rate higher when it comes to spacial IQ and no doubt they have built some amazing civilizations.</p>
<p>Every White country in the WORLD is expected to integrate and accept third world inhabitants as the crime rates skyrocket. Why is it only White countries? Go tell China they need to integrate with other races, or Japan, or Mexico, or any non-White country you can think of. They will laugh in your face. </p>
<p>Why is their a double standard regarding diversity Lindsey? Can you explain that? Why won&rsquo;t countries like Japan and China and Singapore accept people from Africa with open arms? Is it because only Whites understand the benefits of diversity and therefore those OTHER countries are somehow lacking or less intelligent? </p>
<p>Please explain that Lindsey. </p>

Whites were a bane. Ditto for another very great ancient civilization - India. After the Brits were kicked out, despite it&rsquo;s problems India has done much better comparatively. As for Singapore - its the world&rsquo;s cleanest, technologically proficient &amp; a nation which is near perfect especially after the high IQ Han Chinese &amp; Southern Indians (Tamils) took over and created the most perfect nation on Earth - zero poverty, near zero crime rate and 100% literacy rate.

<p>What are you talking about? Well, Ms. Weiss, (doesn&rsquo;t sound like an asian name to me) are you another pro-asian advocate coming on AR to spout nonsense?</p>
<p>The question was asked, &#8221; Can any of these diversity lovers name any place on earth that IMPROVED after Whites moved out and blacks/non-Whites moved in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>PLEASE tell me where China, India and Singapore have millions of blacks and non-whites living in their countries? Don&rsquo;t you know the difference between a homogenous nation and one such as the &#8220;new&#8221; America? America was the best and greatest country on earth when it was WHITE, bar none.</p>
<p>As for your insistence on those 3 being &#8220;great&#8221; countries to live, I beg to differ.<br>

		<p>&#8220;We vehemently disagree with New Century&rsquo;s cause. Diversity is a strength. Our nation, our community and our college are all built on it. We believe the organization&rsquo;s beliefs are incorrect and even crude. They are, and certainly should be, unpopular.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quack quack goes the duckpeaker.  Certainly&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage you to visit amren.com and read what the group has to say. Discuss it with your peers, professors and others in the community. Talk about how it makes you feel and think about why diversity is a strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interesting.  At least someone encouraged the reader to actually investigate for themselves.  Makes one wonder if perhaps a heretic or two may be lurking amongst the editors, quacking the duckspeak in a form of racial kitman but in fact pointing the way.  I love the commissar-like exhortation and directive at the end to how one should properly react&hellip;</p>
<p>Any publicity is good publicity - the Earth is not the center of the universe and no amount of dogma can hide that forever&hellip;</p>
<p>So sure kids - go visit that awful, horrible &#8220;racist&#8221; old Amren and read what they say&hellip;</p>
<p>So you will know the truth.</p>

		<p>While clearly some AmRen readers and posters are white supremacists, I don&rsquo;t think the majority of us are.  We&rsquo;re simply race realists who believe everybody should have equal opportunity and let the chips fall where they may. And if whites and Asians seem to come out ahead in this game and blacks seem to do less well, that&rsquo;s just way it is.  It brings us neither joy nor feelings of guilt. I think most of us wish it weren&rsquo;t that way, but we didn&rsquo;t design the human gene pool.</p>

Lindsey, yes, you are indeed correct that China, India and Singapore are better off without white exploitation. And yes, that is what the question asked. But read the context of the question, which is DIVERSITY. Whites were providing DIVERSITY which was undermining and weakening those places. Once the DIVERSITY, in this case, whites, were removed, the places again began to prosper, strengthened by their very LACK OF DIVERSITY.  Remember the original article also stated, &#8220;Statistics prove that any nation, community or college that has a lot of diversity also have more crime, are not as well maintained and have a lot of infighting amongst the various groups.&#8221; </p>

<p>Los Angeles was built on a fault zone - it doesn&rsquo;t mean that earthquakes are a &#8216;strength&rsquo;. If a heavy smoker completes a marathon he does it despite being a heavy smoker - not because of it.</p>
<p>Diversity of skills = good. Diversity of race/religion = malignant clutter. There are no examples of countries being successful because of diversity - only countries being successful in spite of diversity.</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m curious to read some academic research studies &#8216;proving&rsquo; that diversity is a strength. Oh wait - there aren&rsquo;t any.</p>
<p>Try suggesting to a liberal that it&rsquo;s selfish for White countries to be getting all the &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, and so it should be sent to troubled, third-world countries instead. Perhaps a couple of million Sudanese transported to Haiti would make it happier, more prosperous place.</p>
<p>When they moan that Haiti lacks the infrastructure to cope with mass immigration just smile condescendingly and remind them that America itself was built from nothing using &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. If they still disagree act all offended and ask them why they think that Sudanese immigrants are a burden?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Arabs were once creators of a great civilization. Unfortunately, they never really recovered from the Mongolian conquests of the thirteenth century. The religion that unites them has become a force for intolerance and obscurantism. &#8220;</p>
<p>Enough of this nonsense. Where are you getting this? Other than the upper Middle East (Turkey), where else have Mongolians changed the demographics of the Middle East?  &#8220;Arabs&#8221; (not all people in the Middle East are arab) intermixed heavily with blacks in the southern parts of the Middle East at one time. I thought Mongolians were part of the high IQed ethnic group that some people on here enjoy complimenting on here all the time anyways. The fact of the matter is that arabs have never been creators of &#8220;advanced civilization&#8221; at least not to the same level as Europeans.  Much of this advanced math that arabs are given credit for was created by Greeks, Persians and Hindus (all Indo-European). I don&rsquo;t understand why so many whites are so fascinated with a desert dwelling group that came storming out of the Arabian Peninsula, and that only became &#8220;great&#8221; when coming into contact with other civilizations that already existed in the Mediterranean region. </p>

PEORIA  &mdash; <br>
Two motorists were accosted by groups of teenagers within a few days of each other in an area near the site of a similar incident over the summer that drew national attention.<br>
A group of about 50 young people on West Thrush Avenue near North Sheridan Road in June caused a disturbance by blocking the roadway and, according to one resident but not others, shouting race-related remarks.<br>
Comments related to race also were part of one of the incidents last week.<br>
A Meals on Wheels delivery driver was making his way to a home in the 800 block of West Nowland Avenue about 12:45 p.m. Wednesday when he encountered a group of 15 teens - 13 males and two females - walking down the middle of the road.<br>
The group would not yield to the motorist, who followed him until reaching the house where he had to make the meal delivery. As he exited to take the food to the door, he was verbally attacked, according to a report on the incident.<br>
One teen called him &#8220;honky,&#8221; while another threatened to &#8220;kick his white (expletive).&#8221;<br>
As the volunteer driver returned to his car to leave, the teens surrounded his car and pounded on it. The vehicle was not damaged, but police noted disturbances to dust on the vehicle, backing up the driver&rsquo;s story.<br>
A woman driving in the 800 block of West Brons Avenue on Saturday night was the subject of a similar, but much more aggressive confrontation. She encountered a group of more than 40 teens about 10:25 p.m.<br>
The group surrounded the 21-year-old woman&rsquo;s car and began beating on it with an object that shattered her driver&rsquo;s side window. One of the boys involved in the attack also pointed a handgun in the direction of a passenger in the car, but didn&rsquo;t make any threats or attempt to open the door.<br>
When police responded, the group scattered in different directions. No arrests were made.<br>
Both incidents remain under investigation by police. Public information officer Doug Burgess said Monday the incidents do not appear to be organized efforts, but rather the byproduct of unruly circumstances.<br>
&#8220;It&rsquo;s not groups that are getting together to wreak havoc on the community,&#8221; Burgess said.<br>
The group Wednesday likely had just left school after District 150 released students early for the day. Police also have fielded reports that the group Saturday night had just left a nearby house party. The large group in June, too, had been at a house party just before that incident.</p>

		<p>America&rsquo;s new racists<br>
The late South African economist William Hutt, in his 1964 book, &#8220;The Economics of the Colour Bar,&#8221; said that one of the supreme tragedies of the human condition is that those who have been the victims of injustices and oppression &#8220;can often be observed to be inflicting not dissimilar injustices upon other races.&#8221;</p>
<p>Born in 1936, I&rsquo;ve lived through some of our openly racist history, which has included racist insults, beatings and lynchings. Tuskegee Institute records show that between the years 1880 and 1951, 3,437 blacks and 1,293 whites were lynched. I recall my cousin&rsquo;s and my being chased out of Fishtown and Grays Ferry, two predominantly Irish Philadelphia neighborhoods, in the 1940s, not stopping until we reached a predominantly black North or South Philly neighborhood.</p>
<p>Today all that has changed. Most racist assaults are committed by blacks. What&rsquo;s worse is there&rsquo;re blacks, still alive, who lived through the times of lynching, Jim Crow laws and open racism who remain silent in the face of it.</p>
<p>Last year, four black Skidmore College students yelled racial slurs while they beat up a white man because he was dining with a black man. Skidmore College&rsquo;s first response was to offer counseling to one of the black students charged with the crime. In 2009, a black Columbia University professor assaulted a white woman during a heated argument about race relations. According to interviews and court records obtained and reported by Denver&rsquo;s ABC affiliate (12/4/2009), black gangs roamed downtown Denver verbally venting their hatred for white victims before assaulting and robbing them during a four-month crime wave. Earlier this year, four black girls beat a white girl at a McDonald&rsquo;s, and the victim suffered a seizure. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel ordered an emergency shutdown of the beaches in Chicago because mobs of blacks were terrorizing families. According to the NBC affiliate there (6/8/2011), a gang of black teens stormed a city bus, attacked white victims and ran off with their belongings.</p>
<p>At Philly&rsquo;s South Philadelphia High School, Asian students report that black students routinely pelt them with food and beat, punch and kick them in school hallways and bathrooms as they hurl racial epithets such as &#8220;Hey, Chinese!&#8221; and &#8220;Yo, Dragon Ball!&#8221; The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund charged the School District of Philadelphia with &#8220;deliberate indifference&#8221; toward black victimization of Asian students.</p>
<p>In many of these brutal attacks, the news media make no mention of the race of the perpetrators. If it were white racist gangs randomly attacking blacks, the mainstream media would have no hesitation reporting the race of the perps. Editors for the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune admitted to deliberately censoring information about black crime for political reasons. Chicago Tribune Editor Gerould Kern recently said that the paper&rsquo;s reason for censorship was to &#8220;guard against subjecting an entire group of people to suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>These racist attacks can, at least in part, be attributed to the black elite, who have a vested interest in racial paranoia. And that includes a president who has spent years aligned with people who have promoted racial grievance and polarization and appointed an attorney general who&rsquo;s accused us of being &#8220;a nation of cowards&#8221; on matters of race and has refused to prosecute black thugs who gathered at a Philadelphia voting site in blatant violation of federal voter intimidation laws. Tragically, black youngsters - who are seething with resentments, refusing to accept educational and other opportunities unknown to blacks yesteryear - will turn out to be the larger victims in the long run.</p>
<p>Black silence in the face of black racism has to be one of the biggest betrayals of the civil rights struggle that included black and white Americans</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve learned while posting in Knoxville that in all that beautiful and heavily White region, the principle nodes from which anti-Whites spread their genocidal poison are colleges, universities, and news media.</p>
<p>But those nodes do not yet reflect the overall feeling of the people who live there, as the following email I sent to a friend last night will show:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m amazed that anyone is still saying &#8216;diversity is strength.&rsquo; But Wise is way up in the back of some dark holler, as the song says&hellip;.I had a fantasy of moving there for a long time and subscribed to their newspaper until a few years ago. It was fun to read&hellip;my favorite article was when an old guy on their school board said cheerily at a public meeting, &#8220;There&rsquo;s a [N-word] in the woodpile,&#8221; and didn&rsquo;t seem to realize even afterward that that was no longer a cool thing to say! Ha ha! Hard to believe, but it sure was refreshing. He had been a high school teacher of something like typing, and a young black woman who had been a student of his and had liked him felt very hurt and betrayed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course I make a mistake to repeat that story here, since any young students from Wise who read it will fail to grasp its several points and instead will only be reinforced in their foolish anti-White beliefs.</p>
<p>There is so much to explain, and so little brainpower left in our hypnotized youngsters to understand it with.</p>

<p>You must be joking. And you are wrong for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>I am not going to join the Amren crowd that chants the same rebuttals to posts like this such as : &#8221; yes Asians have created great civilizations BUT&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is time for the American Renaissance faithful to stop with this nonsense about how great Asians are.  Yes, their civilizations were great compared to other nonwhite civilizations (and in the case of Southern Asia and the Middle East a lot of this had to do with interactions with Indo-Europeans), but nobody can convince me that any of these civilizations have been as great as what whites have produced.  What was so great about them that we have to constantly cheerlead them as better than white civilizations on here?  </p>
<p>Give me a list of Chinese &#8220;inventions&#8221; and I can give you a longer list of Greek ideas and inventions that actually led to something useful (the modern world).  And of course that is only focusing on Greece alone and excluding many other white nations. </p>
<p>And in response to this poster inparticular, he seems to miss the cause and effect pattern involved that actually made places like China &#8220;great&#8221; in modern times to begin with. Liberals love talking about how &#8220;after the Europeans left, things got better&#8221;.  Well, shouldn&rsquo;t we come to the conclusion that perhaps these areas became great because of European influence?</p>
<p>People like this poster here act as if India and China returned to their old ways after Europeans left and then became great because of it.  Are you joking?  Everybody cheerleads the developments India and China have made in Space Exploration recently as if these two nations are uniquely better than the West, but if that is the case then why Space Exploration ( a white creation) instead of something that is indigenous to those two civilizations?  The fact that India and China STILL get most of their current technology from the West is beside the point here.</p>
<p>And as an aside, I agree that Asians should be able to build up their societies as they see fit.  And I also agree that white colonialism wasn&rsquo;t necessarily moral for those countries.  However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that I am going to ignore facts, and it is simply untrue to say that Asians had nothing of value to learn from Europeans, or to imply that these civilizations are somehow better than anything Europeans have to offer. </p>
<p>I think posters on Amren need to learn how to think outside the box on this issue instead of automatically calling posters such as myself &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; for stating facts on how whites are better at many things compared to other races, including  Asians.  It is simply the truth, just as there are other things that other races do better than we do. But if we wish to discuss the modern world, the fact is that it was created by white people and only white people. If Asians are going to become the next superpowers based on their own intellects then why don&rsquo;t they start from scratch from where their own civilizations left off before they were influenced by white people?  </p>

<p>Yes Lindsey you thought of three(3) all of which were Asian. You forgot one of Tom S&rsquo;s premises about Blacks moving in. You can&rsquo;t name one country, city or town that has improved with the advent of Blacks.</p>
<p> In all fairness the British as insufferable as they may have been in India left infrastructure, and governmental models to be followed which helped India to advance albeit the many problems that they endure not all of which can be laid at the feet of England.</p>
<p> You forgot to mention Africa which prospered under the British rule and when they left the Africans were totally incapable of creating a civilized society. The savagery and butchery continues unabated.  Many South Africans stated in interviews that they were better off under Apartheid in the sense that they at least had jobs.</p>
<p>China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore all successful, all Asian and all non-diverse.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;cultural genocide&#8221; and abuse of the Chinese people, I would say that the Emperors and Mao Tse Tung did a yeoman&rsquo;s job of abusing the people. The  Communist cultural revolution sought to obliterate the previous culture and resulted in the extermination of 25 million people by most accounts. No evil White people to blame for that. You also forgot the &#8220;Cultural Genocide&#8221; of the Tibetan people by the Chinese.<br>
Pol Pot in Kampuchea AKA Cambodia, managed to exterminate a quarter of his population; again without any help from the evil White people.</p>
<p>From your name and from what you wrote I would guess that you are White and self loathing and have no White children to leave behind to be slaughtered. If I&rsquo;m wrong about that, shame on you!</p>

<p>As aggravating as it may be to give a newspaper money for an ad and then get insulted and berated by that paper, we should probably be glad that   &mdash;   in this age of conference cancellations and other banishments and persecutions   &mdash;   AR was able to find a couple of publications that would run their ad <i>at all.</i> At least these two college papers didn&rsquo;t just turn the ad down flat, while mumbling something about &#8220;unacceptable content&#8221;.

		<p>Reading the article about diversity is strength and other absurd claims. We WN have to admit, creativity and IQ of Whites aside, apparently our people have a propensity to believe anything! There is no other explanation. Anyone with even an average IQ can see that America is coming apart at the seams. This for a country that 50 years ago was the most advanced and creative society in the history of the world. At least for most of my life I lived in THAT country rather than the heap called modern multicultural America.</p>
<p>The idea of importing of people from countries that are basically basket cases corrupt and non creative and expecting the civilization of our youth to remain unchanged is beyond naiveté it s insanity. I need a drink!</p>

		<p>Several points regarding the diversity lover&rsquo;s points about China, India and Singapore. First, Whites never migrated in mass to any of those three countries nor did they become a sizable percentage of the population so therefore the central thesis of her argument is immediately in error. Second, as to her charge that &#8220;During the imperialist reign by various European powers and the cultural genocide, oppression, abuse and exploitation of the Chinese people - &ldquo;Chinese Melon&rdquo;&hellip;.one of the greatest civilizations on Earth - China was completely devastated.&#8221; it should be pointed out that at no time did Europeans negatively affect Chinese civilization nor traditions in a manner that can be compared to the damage inflicted by the Asians and Chinese themselves during the Mongol invasions, Taiping Rebellion and of course the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution of Mao. Third, I suggest that she take a look at the HDI and see if it supports her claim that these three countries are generally better off than majority White countries. In 2010, the highest ranking of the three was Singapore at 27, followed by China at 91 and India at 122. For comparison, she might care to note the fact that the top 10 countries in the ranking all are majority White countries of Europe or North America and that the majority of those listed under Very High Human Development are as well. Fourth, if she does believe that the limited arrival of Whites into those three countries negatively impacted the native population, is she open to the idea that the arrival in mass of Asians, blacks, Hispanics and Muslims into Australia, Europe and North America may very well negatively affect their resident populations?       </p>

<p>Are you serious about India? It still has a primitive caste system with the whitest people rising to the top. They still worship rats, cows and live in their own mess, with low IQs. Not to mention that the roma gypsies (70 IQ and a crime rate that beats blacks) originated from India.</p>
<p>India had moments of greatness hundreds of years ago when led by Caucasians. <br>
-<br>
And you think Singapore is the perfect nation? Why is it that so many Singaporeans love to get out of there but never the other way around? Same with China. The societies may be orderly but they are also soulless and oppressive. People there are worked like animals and that&rsquo;s how they can come close to whites in achievement, but still cannot create original science and civilization like whites. Or were Korea and Japan oppressed by whites too?<br>

Deep down a lot of Asians envy whites for their combination of beauty, physical prowess and ingenuity. </p>

<p>You know, going big time may mean going small time.  I mean that going after the issue at the community college level might be best.  These community colleges have taken on the worst aspects of the Ivy League leftists and can change the quickest.  These schools exist throughout the local white communities and are the real beach head for immigration and even miscegenation.  The center of immigrant matriculation and accommodation is certainly responsible for the higher influx of non-whites in Washington State where I live.  I saw it at work in California in the &rsquo;70s as well.  Great community colleges became pools of immigrants and state bureaucratic handouts until whites avoided some campuses altogether because the neighborhoods changed due to the matriculation at community and state college admissions ans support tactics.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll cut to the chase. A proper &#8220;conservative&#8221; would have a bumper sticker that reads <i>Question Authorities</i>, while the left likes <i>Question Authority.</i> The slightly different spelling makes a world of difference.  The left wingers just don&rsquo;t seem to like the concept of authority, while we know that authority has to exist, we want to be picky about who gets to do it, what their latitude is, and their reasons for doing what they do.  Except the hypocritical left shows its totalitarian stripe when it gets any appreciable power.</p>

		<p>Whites presently in the majority within established white nations have every right to retain &#8220;supremacy&#8221;.<br>
As for the whole world, do we want instead Chinese, Arab or African &#8220;supremacy&#8221;, let alone a combined non-white &#8220;supremacy&#8221;?The prospect of an anti-white global race conflict remains on the cards so long as an &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; population explosion in non-white countries continues, and we should prepare to defend white nations against this possibility, particularly with respect to cyber-warfare and space-weaponry being developed by Chinese technicians. <br>
Inside &#8220;white&#8221; nations, law-abiding non-whites will feel less uncomfortable and less threatened, after an impartial ban on multi-ethnic immigration, because this will reduce inter-ethnic conflict and resource rivalry.<br>
It is easier to treat a small number of decent people of different pigment or culture kindly, so long as they do not multiply to threatening proportions or give prior loyalty to alien governments. One Chinese takeaway does not make a Mongol Horde or a Cultural Revolution.<br>
Law-breakers, whatever their race, can be dealt with by prison without &#8220;marital rights&#8221;, voluntary sterilisation, and the death-penalty for deliberate murder, terrorism or child torture.<br>
The acculturation of law-abiding ethnic minority folk to white-western norms is possible and tolerable, so long as any biological disadvantages, from racial assimilation or moron multiplication, are prevented by an impartial humanitarian eugenics policy.<br>
Those who cannot fit in psychologically with such a policy should be assisted to migrate to preferred culture zones overseas. This would make little difference to the population problem in countries which must sooner or later develop contraception, whatever happens here.</p>
<p>AmRen&rsquo;s position is not &#8220;unpopular&#8221; with ordinary white folks outside ideologically controlled acade/media; and some thoughtful non-whites long settled in white lands may well be privately relieved by the programme developed above.<br>

<p>Your are right about the Mongolian invasion.  But they have had 700 years to recover.  One would think that they could have got the Iraq irrigation system Genghis destroyed up and running by now.  I know he either killed or brought back to central Asia everyone who worked on it.  I know he took back all the manuals and tech information.</p>
<p>But still, they have had 700 years to recover. I mean if non Arab non Muslim stone age people 6,000 years ago could start that irrigation system, surely the Iraqis from 1400 on could have done the same thing.</p>
<p>Most of the so called great achievement 700 to 1200 under Arab Muslim control was done by Christians and Jews.  Christians were 40 percent of most of those countries.</p>
<p>The Alhambra and other splendid buildings in Spain are supposed to be one of the glories of Muslim Arab civilization.  Truth is, it was all built by Christian slaves, from engineers and designers to laborers.  The scholars that Haroun al Rashid funded to copy the great works of antiquity were Christian Syrian monks who had been doing it for centuries in their monastery.</p>

<p>The British DID do some bad things in China, but it also opened it up to the world.  It was already an inward gazing, shell of a once great dynastic ruling class, which I how Britain got in to begin with.  Even more so for India.  Singapore seems to be prospering due to the West as do the former two.  India was a post empire region of warring tribes when Britain arrived.  India today is successful chiefly because of the discipline and industrial management styles AND English (including English culture) that India learned.  Ghandi greatly admired the British.  He just felt it was time for India to learn to rule itself.  </p>
<p>Today although it looks fairly stable India&rsquo;s post-British civil war between Muslims and Hindus is simmering just under the surface (and sometimes boiling in Kashmir).  Both Pakistan and India acquired nuclear weapons and both have recent history and character that underscores the real risk that implies.</p>
<p>India and China have both passed the US and nearly everywhere else as the most polluted nations in the world.  The public health hazards in India are astounding.  Wonderful places to live?</p>

Many liberals dismiss those who disagree with them as being ignorant. One reason for that ignorance may be the fact that many liberals suppress scientific facts about the reasons for racial differences.<br>
 <br>
I admit that I am ignorant of scientific evidence that the average Australian Aborigine has the same intellectual potential as the average Ashkenazic Jew. When I ask for evidence, however, I do not receive education; I receive insults.<br>
 <br>
I do not feel any hostility or contempt for Aborigines at all. They fascinate me. By studying them we can learn about what our ancestors were like over fifteen thousand years ago. I also think they have been mistreated. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, I will not believe something unless there is evidence for it. I am ignorant of evidence for innate racial equality.    </p>

		<p>I work with UCI students on occasion. They come from all races and backgrounds. I have to say that they are mostly great kids and I enjoy working with them. What disturbs me is what they are learning. They often parrot what their professors tell them. The professors are basically grooming them to be marxists. Not only does it disgust me, but we are paying for this with our tax dollars. These smug, racist, marxist professors are paid six figure salaries and live in luxury university-owned houses. The houses they live in would cost $2 million+ in the current market. They are teaching young people how to hate America, hate religion, hate the free market system, and sometimes hate white people. WE ARE PAYING FOR THIS. It fills me with rage to know this is happening. </p>
<p>I try to calmly tell the students that these liberal classes are a waste of time. Marxism does not work&hellip;study engineering, medicine, business&hellip;something useful. They often listen to me, but they always go back to their Soviet classes and continue with their indoctrination.  These college students commonly remain left wing until they are older or forever. I&rsquo;ve heard many parents complain that these liberal universities turn their children against them. </p>
<p>We all want our children to attend college, but their must be away to do away with left-wing, radical professors. We need to start harrassing them like they harrass us.  It is easy to acquire email addresses and phone numbers of college professors. If there is one who is teaching your child something awful, it&rsquo;s time to start calling them and sending them emails. Contact them every day until they are yelling at you and their hands are shaking. Also, complain to the administration and to your local state representative.  We need to stop supporting a system that is trying to destroy us.</p>

Do you not feel the pressure they apply to you in this regard to agree with the conclusion that &#8220;white privilege&#8221; still exists and is a problem?   Do they not cite examples of outcome inequalities among racial groups and assert that these differences exist because of &#8220;white privilege&#8221;, in effect bullying you into this conclusion because to disagree with them is to openly admit you believe, for example, that blacks, for whatever reason, tend to not score as <br>
high on tests (whether you believe that&rsquo;s genetic or cultural it will make no difference to them)?  </p>
<p>Try it.  Try challenging your teachers to at least consider that what they call &#8220;white privilege&#8221; may not be the cause of these outcome inequalities and that certain groups, for <br>
whatever reasons, perform at different levels. Try it and see how &#8220;tolerant&#8221; your teachers are of this suggestion, at even <br>
considering that there could be another reason beyond the concept of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; they are espousing. See how long it <br>
takes them to at the very least imply that you are a bigot or racist and and alienate you from your peers.  </p>
<p>The thing is&hellip;on some level you already know this is how it works.  Ever wonder why in these types of &#8220;instruction&#8221; everyone magically arrives at the same conclusion?  Because to not do so is to be cast out and vilified.  It&rsquo;s called peer pressure.  Not very scientific is it?  Would you say that in relating to their students in this manner your teachers are &#8220;tolerating diversity&#8221;?</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you serious about India? It still has a primitive caste system with the whitest people rising to the top. They still worship rats, cows and live in their own mess, with low IQs. Not to mention that the roma gypsies (70 IQ and a crime rate that beats blacks) originated from India.&#8221;</p>
<p>I did state that India has it&rsquo;s own fair share of problems BUT it is MUCH better off without the British. Infact despite it&rsquo;s problems, India is one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economies with the fastest growing middle class almost the population of the entire United States. It is one of those few nations in this economic recession to have successfully eliminated it&rsquo;s percetile of poverty.</p>

<p> Now talking about IQ&rsquo;s - India DOES have the highest IQ people &amp; the lowest too. For eg. South Indian Upper castes have the highest IQ of any human community at 120-125 outscoring Ashkhenaz Jews, East Asians &amp; Nordic whites.</p>
<p><a href="http://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/06/indias-average-iq-in-2100.html" rel="nofollow">http://isteve.blogspot.com/2008/06/indias-average-iq-in-2100.html</a></p>
<p>However the make only a small %&rsquo;age of the population, wheras lowercastes make the majority bringing the overall average national IQ down.</p>
<p>&#8220;India had moments of greatness hundreds of years ago when led by Caucasians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caucasian is a very misleading term in anthropology. Almost all Indians are Caucasians. Theres a big difference between Indian caucasian and European white. India&rsquo;s success was always due to Indian caucasians themselves&hellip;.from Sashurtha - the Father of surgery to Gautam Buddha - one of the greatest religious philosophers &amp; Aryanbhatta - a legendary mathematician. <br>
-<br>
Also, after achieving independence from the lousy British, Indians have become more successful as individuals too. Take for instance the fact that Indians are now the wealthiest community in Great Britain or that the wealthiest man in UK is an Indian - Laskhmi Mittal or the fact that an Indian owns the world&rsquo;s most expensive home in downtown Mumbai. Funny that Indian students also outperform white Britons to earn the highest academic scores at high school at Cambridge level. And ironically, the very East India company which was the star of the British crown ( which financed &amp; carried out colonial operations from the Americas &amp; Africas to Asia &amp; Australia (for the once Mighty Brits) is now OWNED by an Indian.</p>

<p>This is way too easy for me to offer a rebuttal to. I have argued with you and others like you on here over and over again, and each time I tell you the same thing.  You always list such and such period that other people were more advanced than Europeans. How does this disprove my main point&hellip;.that European civilization has produced more than anybody else has?  </p>
<p>And I never said Europeans were the only ones to produce civilization. Nope, I said that Europeans have produced more than anyone else and that Europeans were the only ones to create the modern world. So in that case, I don&rsquo;t understand your point about the modern arabs being partly related to the Ancient Egyptians.</p>
<p>As to your comments about Northern Europeans coming on the civilization scene kind of late, how typical of what is taught in the modern liberal university? Do whites think for themselves anymore?  Of course Northern Europeans came onto the scene later. Most of Europe had a rigid climate while Middle Easterners, Indians, and Chinese people were enjoying their lush river valleys.  But AGAIN, how does any of this mean that whites have failed to create more than everyone else in history OVERALL?</p>

<p>&ldquo;YES! I can think of 3 right now: China, India &amp; Singapore. During the imperialist reign by various European powers and the cultural genocide, oppression, abuse and exploitation of the Chinese people -</p>
<p>Lindsey please read some Chinese history.  I think you got the info about China from some false university anti White racists course.</p>
<p>China was never a colony of any Europeans.  Europeans did have Macao and later Hong Kong as colonies leased by the Chinese goverment.  Macao was an empty tiny Penninsula when the Portaguese arrived.  The Portaguese leased it from the Chinese govermnet.  The Chinese leased it because the area was unpopulated.  The Portaguese built a thriving city and harbor.<br>
The Chinese loved Macao because China benefited greatly from Macao exports of Chinese goods, especially tea all over the world.</p>
<p>There was a wall enclosing the end of the Penninsula where it joined the mainland.  There was a large open gate.  No European was allowed on the Chinese side.  Chinese were allowed on the Macao side.  Macao benefitted China a lot more than it benefitted the Portaguese.  For centuries it was the only harbor in China that exported Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Hong Kong had less than a thousand people when the English leased it in I think 1849.  The reason Hong Kong was so underpopulated is that it has very little water.  Hong Kong could not support a population more than a thousand until the British dug deep wells with their British machinery and skills.</p>
<p>Shangahi was a tiny settlement when the English and French built the harbor and industries.</p>
<p>China was never a colony of any European nation whatever nonsense you learned in college.  It was always ruled by the Emperor and Chinese goverment officials.  Macao and Hong Kong were ruled jointly, with the Chinese goverment ultimately in charge.  </p>
<p>There were areas highly impacted by European settlers.  There were thousands of Christian missionaries all over China.  This was nothing new.  Syrian monks reached China cerca 250.  There were Catholic bishops in Bejing in the 1200&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>I suppose they taught you the horrors of the seperate business courts?  It is true.  Because of the racism of the Han Chinese, the European businesses were sequestered in ghettoes they were not allowed to leave.  The Chinese goverment ordered them to set up their own courts for their business and other civil disputes.  The Chinese govermnets ordered them to police themselves.  Since they were not allowed to leave those ghettoes they did police themselves.</p>
<p>Later in Shanghia and some but not all other places the westerners were allowed to live among the Chinese.</p>
<p>China is a very large and very old country.  It has had good and bad times.  It has been highly centralized and then fallen into feudalism and then centralized again.</p>
<p>The 19th century was one of the bad times for China.  In 1830 a civil war began.  It lasted off and on for 30 years although the main rebellion was broken by imperial troops about 1840. The rebellion was led by Guandong province.  The repression by the imperial troops led to the Cantonese diaspora.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the people and  language of the overseas Chinese was always Cantonese until the 1980&rsquo;s when other Chinese fled their communist starvation and slaughter.  </p>
<p>When the civil war started the Emperor was severely retarded and everyone knew it.  His 2 wives did the best they could but the situation was bad.  The main result of the civil war was that the country split into sectionalism and feudalism.  With invaders all over the country, warlords rose to protect their own people and territory.  It was nothing new.  It was the cycle of centralism to feudalism back to centralism that had been going on for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The retarded Emperor had a retarded son.  He became Emperor and his Mother ruled for him.  The imperial family had thousands of members.  Hundreds were adult men who could have been very effective Emperors.  The worst would have been more effective than 2 retarded emperors for most of the 19th century.</p>
<p>But the imperial family did not do the obvious thing; retire the retarded emperor and select a capable one.</p>
<p>Remember, Lindsey that China was not ruled by Han Chinese from about 1600 to 1910.  Did they teach that in your hate Whitey anti colonialism class?  During the latter part of the 19th century the Han got a successful revolutionary movement together.</p>
<p>The retarded Emperor&rsquo;s Mother became Empress when he died.  She did the best she could with what she had.  The Han revolutionaries were determined to overthrow her, the Manchu Empress.  The civil war had left the country feudal and regional instead of centralized.  Warlords ruled out side Bejing.</p>
<p>The Empress then did the stupidest thing any ruler has ever done.<br>
She was dying. She designated a 2 year old great great grandson as her heir.  Again the imperial family allowed this.  There were several grandsons and great grandsons who would have been competent Emperors.</p>
<p>Instead China was ruled by corrupt officials and servants in the name of a 2 year old.  The last Emperor was not allowed to see his parents.   </p>
<p>Finally in 1910 the Han revolution succeeded.  The Manchu Emperor was overthown and China became a Han republic.</p>
<p>Things got worse.  the bandit warlord goverment got worse.  The central goverment got weaker.  In the 1920&rsquo;s the Russians sent communists into China.  Small scale revolutions and civil wars broke out all over.  </p>
<p>In the 1930&rsquo;s the Japanese invaded and took over large sections of the country.  In 15 years of occupation the Japanese did more damage to the Chinese people, their culture, their economy and country than the Europeans did in 400 years.</p>
<p>From 1930 to 1945 the Chinese fought each other instead of uniting against the Japanese. 1948 the Han  communists took over.  They have murdered about 200 million of their own people since.  They have caused untold damage to the environment.</p>
<p>Mao&rsquo;s backyard steel production experiment did not produce 1 ounce of steel. To find the fuel for the back yard steel set ups, China was deforested.  Millions of acres of trees were cut down for the back yard steel experiment. Billions of tons of metal including from kitchen equipment to trucks to steel girders in buildings to bridges to railroad tracks and the trains were melted down in the great backyard steel experiment.</p>
<p>The ony good thing about the communist horror is that it unified <br>
China once again with  mass murder.  China is now centralized and seems to have a competent and reasonable goverment something it has not had since the early 1800&rsquo;s when the imperial family allowed a retarded man to be crowned.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s problems since 1800 are problems China and its people created.  The European business colonies did nothing but help by exporting its goods to the world, something the native Chinese did not attempt to do because it was forbidden for the Chinese to export its goods to the outside world until the han revolution.</p>
<p>Had the Europeans not established their colonies in Macao and HongKong China would have been a lot worse off than it was.</p>
<p>Hope you didnt&rsquo; pay $50,00 per year in tuition to learn a totally false version of Chinese history from 1600 to 1945.</p>
<p>Did your marxist professor teach you that the communists never massacred anyone?  Did they tell you there were no famines 1945 to 1990?  Did they tell you the communists only executed spies, dissidents and sabatuers? <br>

<p>Your diatribe on India ended with the statement above.</p>
<p>Great sense of humor you have there.  </p>
<p>How about some facts on &#8220;physical prowess&#8221;?  How many gold medals has India achieved in the Olympics in their entire history?  Just a couple.  They are just not athletic.</p>
<p>Beauty speaks for itself. Western women have that locked up.  Blame God if you don&rsquo;t like that one.  </p>
<p>No doubt there are a lot of good things coming out of India and China these days, but comparing them to the white kids of today that have had educations emphasizing &#8220;social justice,&#8221; &#8220;women&rsquo;s studies,&#8221; even &#8220;sports medicine&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t cover the story.  People posting at AMREN will make that exact same point.</p>
<p>Discard diversity, affirmative action, the EEOC, the NEA and a host of other government meddling, allow our countries to embrace the pursuit of excellence like we used to and see what happens.  History has already show what happens.  We create the most liveable societies in the world.</p>

<p>Then please explain why Singapore ranks 27th in the Human Development Index and the top ten countries in the world according to that important statistic that measures well-being are all majority white such as Norway (1), Australia (2) and New Zealand (3). As regards the &#8220;lousy British,&#8221; are you willing to state that the influx of lousy Africans, Asians and Muslims have had generally negative consequences for the native population of Britain, an example being the recent riots and destruction caused by mainly non-white hooligans? If it is true that India is better off without Whites might it be true as well that Britain and other White nations could very well be better off without non-whites? I generally admire and respect Asians, unlike blacks for example, but I strongly feel that we do not need them in our countries any more than they need us in theirs. </p>

		<p>Diversity is neither desirable nor practicable; it can only be achieved when an authoritarian, strong-arm, totalitarian government sits on the &#8220;diverse&#8221; population like a lid on a pressure cooker.   Opposition to the regime means death.  Any dissent is met with a 10 cent bullet in the back of the head. </p>
<p>The United States is fast moving in this direction as the USG enforces a repressive PC Reign of Terror against Native Born White Americans who resist losing their country and culture to a flood of illiterate non-Whites in the name of  &#8220;diversity.&#8221;   Britain is already there.</p>
<p>As the USG continues to mandate LIES such as: &#8220;all cultures are superior to White culture&#8221; and &#8220;race is a social construct&#8221;,  and more Whites wake up and resist, the USG will fight back with more oppression, more tyranny, more laws passed stripping Whites of any remaining rights.  When Whites become a minority in the US, lorded over by non-Whites, they will be in physical danger.</p>
<p><i>The more totalitarian or authoritarian a state, the more government killing. The most rigorously totalitarian countries in the world, including Stalin&rsquo;s Soviet Union, have also been this century&rsquo;s greatest killers</i></p>
<p>After the fall of the Soviet Empire in the early 1990s, the lid blew off; since then more than 100 ethnic-based conflicts have arisen in old Soviet-controlled lands, killing more than five million.  The UN estimates two million of those were children.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end with these quotes about diversity from Jared Taylor:</p>
<p><i>What are the advantages the United States gets from a racially mixed population? None.</i></p>
<p><i>If diversity were a strength people would practice it spontaneously; if diversity were enriching, people would seek it out. It is in private gatherings not governed by some kind of civil-rights law that Americans show just how much strength and enrichment they find in diversity. Such gatherings are usually the very opposite of diverse.</i></p>

<p><i>India&rsquo;s population has grown by 181 million people over the past decade to 1.21bn, according to the 2011 census.

<p><i>Deep down a lot of whites envy &amp; resent Asians for their combination of beauty, physical prowess and ingenuity.</i></p>
<p>Yes, you are certainly correct here too.  A people who have nothing but poker-straight black hair and dark brown eyes are certainly envied for their beauty   &mdash;  unlike us ugly Whites with our blue, green, hazel, and light brown eyes and our blonde, red, light brown, dark brown, auburn and black hair.</p>
<p>Maybe you can explain why so many Asian are obsessed with changing themselves to look more Caucasian through plastic surgery?</p>

<p><i>&#8216;They always tell me they don&rsquo;t like their faces,&rsquo; says Dr Kim &#8216;They want to have some westernized, nice faces. They want to have big eyes like westernized people, high profile, nicer noses.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p><i>The Chinese and Korean patients tell me that they want to have faces like Americans. The idea of beauty is more westernized recently. That means the Asian people want to have a little less Asian, more westernized appearance. They don&rsquo;t like big cheekbones or small eyes. They want to have big, bright eyes with slender, nice facial bones.</i></p>

<p>Computers and the software that drives them, the Internet, the bulk of mathematics, physics and chemistry, 95% of all medical advances and life-saving pharmaceuticals including antibiotics; the internal combustion and jet engines, satellites, rocketry and spacecraft, microscopes, recorded music, television, radios and cameras.</p>
<p>You are a typical White-hating hypocrite and bigot!  You take pleasure in demeaning and disparaging Whites while using making use of the things WE Whites created.</p>

<p>Yes, we Nordic Whites once lived in caves and painted ourselves blue while striving to survive the harsh environmental conditions and long dark winters in N. Europe while other civilizations flourished.  </p>
<p>We Nordic Whites had to figure out how to stay alive in an area of scant plant foods, where sustaining ourselves meant hunting big game.  We also had to figure out how to keep warm and protect our food, ourselves,and loved ones from marauders and predators.  All of these things require high cognitive ability. Those who did not or were not able to plan ahead for the long, cold, dark Nordic winter did not survive, their genes taken out of the gene pool.</p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>I remember the &#8220;Free Speech Movement&#8221; well. Actually, it should have been dubbed &#8220;The Dirty Speech Movement&#8221;,  because that was really what it was all about. There was much less concern given to political or philosophical thought, or about matters of conscience.  It was, in fact, founded by Mario Savio, a New Yorker (from Brooklyn). His concept of free speech was filty speech. Before that, American college students were expected to behave, dress, and speak like young ladies and gentlemen.  After that, they degenerated into a pack of slovenly, filty-mouthed bums spouting obsceneties. It was the newest fad. We have never recovered from it.</p>
<p>The Free [Filthy] Speech Movement did enormous harm to America.<br>
It was not about &#8220;freedom&#8221; at all.  It was part of the overall Marxist  deconstruction of all civilized standards, western standards, and the elevation of the course and the  primitive above the civilized and the refined.</p>
<p>It was part of the Frankfurt School&rsquo;s  &#8220;March Through the Institutions&#8221;. And very effective it was on those gullible college kids who were in revolt against their parents&rsquo; <i>bourgeois </i>mentality! They were going to make a new world   &mdash;    they thought! Look at the wreckage they&rsquo;ve left us.  Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of supposing that it had anything to do with freedom of thought and conscience. Those totalitarians would never have stood for such a thing  &mdash;   certainly not as applies to you. </p>

		<p>A balanced, well-informed, comprehensive and accurate appraisal of the relative global contributions and inter-actions of different racial groups, and especially their own elites, a major enterprise for objective historians, makes no difference one way or another to the right of &#8220;white&#8221; nations to retain ethnic hegemony within their own territories.<br>
A good start, perhaps, is Charles Murray&rsquo;s &#8220;Human Accomplishment: The Pursuit of Excellence in the Arts and Sciences, 800 BC to 1950&#8221; (Harper/Collins, NY 2003).<br>
As a famous Russian remarked, virtually the only &#8220;genuine communists&#8221; left in the world are those dominating western<br>
universities and their publishing houses.<br>
Back in 1951 as a boy I went with my parents to Singapore and, although Britain was fighting Chinese Communists in Malaya, we travelled there with a communist university teacher of Polish extraction destined for a lucrative apppointment, and were entertained in his expensive home; several of my tutors at Oxford and London in the 1960s were marxists, one of them notoriously outspoken; the university situation became gradually worse by promotion rachets.  I remember that Singapore was divided into ethnic areas, was conspicuously clean compared to Indian and Egyptian towns, and in later years adopted a postive eugenics policy to promote a high birth-rate among its best students.  I have doubts about the high IQ levels for East Asians proposed by Lynn and Rushton, because these do not reflect the peasant interiors so much as the enterprising littoral migrants on both sides of the Pacific.<br>

<p>Some of the success of Asians in the West in recent decades is due the parallel success of cultural marxists in taking over Western institutions, in particular, schools and universities.  In fact, there has been a dramatic decline in white students scoring over 600 and 650 on the Verbal SAT. On BookTV.org, in 2010 E. D. Hirsch Jr., [referring to a chart showing the average Verbal SAT score falling about 40 points from 1967 - 2002], pointed out: </p>
<p>&#8220;The absolute number of students who scored above 600 declined by 56 percent and the absolute number of students who scored above 650 declined by 73 percent. A sudden influx of black and Hispanic test-takers cannot explain why large numbers of college-bound middle-class white students suddenly became less proficient. That is what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hirsch did not say this but it is obvious: As America has become more diverse, far fewer whites are scoring above 600 on the Verbal SATs. Diversity, it seems, fuels non-achievement, at least for whites.</p>
<p>It is plausible that much of the decline in white verbal proficiency in recent decades is accounted for by the effect of the ideology of multi-culturalism on curricula, in particular, on history and literature instruction. Textbooks are especially revealing: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning in the early 1980s, as immigrant children again increased in numbers in the public schools, social reformers began to shed most of their remaining academic constraints &hellip; the most effective way to upgrade the status of students whose academic performance in school had barely changed &hellip; was not so much to enhance it positively through celebratory readings but to reduce the moral and cultural status of the mainstream. To do so, they began to load the history and literature curriculum with literary works or other kinds of reading that stressed the flaws and failings of the United States &hellip; Although this literature became known facetiously as &#8216;victim lit&rsquo; or &#8216;white-guilt lit&rsquo; for its highlighting of a group&rsquo;s victimization by white Americans, many teachers believed it was useful precisely because it served to elevate a minority group&rsquo;s moral status, build group solidarity &hellip; and create guilt in white students &hellip;&rdquo; (Losing Our Language: How Multicultural Classroom Instruction is Undermining Our Children&rsquo;s Ability to Read, Write, and Reason, by Sandra Stotsky, 1999, p49) </p>
<p>In Losing our Language, Professor Stotsky, then a Research Associate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, examined &#8220;the contents of the leading readers for grades 4 and 6 published in 1993 and 1995.&#8221; Five years later, in The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003), research professor Diane Ravitch would reveal how textbook publishers efficiently generate such content. Their key instrument: comically elaborate &#8220;bias and sensitivity guidelines&#8221;  &mdash;  some of which, with great difficulty, Ravitch was able to obtain. Below is her description of the guidelines of publishing giant McGraw-Hill: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The MH guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &#8220;Bigots and Bigotry,&#8221; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &#8220;must be identified and discussed.&#8221; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (p44) </p>
<p>My favorite example, however, of the exquisite sensitivity of the textbook and testing industry to the ideological demands of selling to state education systems is an incident Ravitch shared about her 1998 service on the National Assessment Governing Board, the supervisory body for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Ravitch, a Clinton appointee, worked on a subcommittee tasked to review fourth grade reading passages intended for what would have become a voluntary national test: </p>
<p>&ldquo;After I had read about a dozen such passages, a combination of fiction and nonfiction, I realized that the readings themselves had a cumulative subtext: the hero was never a white boy. Instead, the leading character - the one who was most competent, successful, and sympathetic - was invariably either a girl (of any race) or a nonwhite boy. Almost without exception, white boys were portrayed as weak and dependent. In one story, a white boy in a difficult situation weeps and says plaintively, &lsquo; If only my big sister were here, I would know what to do.&rsquo;&rdquo; ( &#8221; Education After the Culture Wars, &#8221; Daedalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Summer, 2002) </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So, a bit of gloating on your part is in order. Whites have been and are being badly damaged by public schools and by their universities.   Whether cultural Marxists will be as successful going forward remains to be seen.</p>

<p>You are obviously intelligent but so very much uninformed. </p>
<p>You see if you truely lived in Asia as I have you should have more of a clue about the actual going ons. I have friends in India, Singapore, and China and the reality you portray is far, far different than what is actually discussed between friends.</p>
<p>Each of these countries are very much racist by Western standards and only the fair skinned, intelligent people rule and place each of the swarthy, low IQ people in a catagory  below themselves.</p>
<p>Sure the official line is what the West wants to hear,&#8221;We are strong multicultural nationas!&#8221; The truth is Han Chinese rule China with absolute power, Singaporean Chinese rule Singapore with absolute power, and the light skinned desendants of the Mogals rule India with absolute power. </p>
<p>Please ask a very drak South Indian what he/she thinks of the Indian power structure. Ask a Malay how they feel about the iron rule of the Chinese in Singapore. Maybe you could ask a Muslim Uygar how they view the central Chinese government.</p>
<p>Please excuse me for my poor grammar and spelling but I wanted you to get a REAL education born of experience not from a book or college professor with an agenda.</p>

Compare Indian beauty queens with  typical white women.  <a href="http://goo.gl/L8WX8" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/L8WX8</a>  Asian women are also have far less feminine physiques than European women.  Mongoloid women especially, tend to have small breasts, and flat buttocks compared with European women, in addition to unappealing baby faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian &amp; Chinese students excel and even outscore white students not just in their countries but even more so even in western nations like the UK, Australia &amp; USA. Academic scores speak volumes unless ofcourse like those underachieving blacks &amp; hispanics you are simply trying to deflect from this core issue with more excuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, Asian parents tend to push their kids academically more than White parents (at least nowadays), and East Asians have slightly higher average IQ scores, however Whites have higher standard deviation (variability) in IQ scores (18 SD versus 12 SD: Jensen, A.R. 1998. The g Factor. Praeger: Connecticut, USA.) meaning that there are far more White geniuses than Asian geniuses.</p>

		<p>Hey, you kiddies at Wise! Did you see what a REAL college newspaper can do, at the link 99 - Anonymous gave?</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans should recognize South African genocide&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the takeover of the ANC government in 1994, racist black gunmen have grotesquely murdered more than 3,000 Afrikaners, [Wise kiddies, Afrikaners are Whites descended from the original European settlers there] according to a March 28, 2010, Times UK article. Often, Afrikaners are forced to watch as their family members are brutalized and tortured before being killed.</p>
<p>Gregory Stanton, head of Genocide Watch and a former law professor, said &#8216;There is a motive of hatred, that these are hate crimes. People are tortured and murdered in ways that are dehumanizing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a 2003 report on the attacks, Genocide Watch found that convicted gunmen &#8216;hated their Afrikaner victims and saw them as &lsquo;dogs&rsquo; rather than people; and that they killed and tortured and raped for this reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis Swanepoel, senior in mechanical engineering, is a K-State student from South Africa. He came here in June 2005 with his parents, who left South Africa to find work and avoid the rising tide of violence. He agrees that Afrikaners are the victims of an ongoing genocide.</p>
<p>&#8216;My friend and his mother were assaulted with golf clubs and his father was killed with a shotgun,&rsquo; Swanepoel said. &#8216;After we moved, the people who bought our house were murdered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swanepoel said the violence cannot be explained as a backlash against apartheid.</p>
<p>&#8216;Afrikaners always get along with older Africans. The people conducting the attacks have grown up after apartheid. A lot of them aren&rsquo;t even from South Africa  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re from Zimbabwe and Mozambique.&rsquo; Swanepoel said of the genocide, &#8216;The ANC might see it but doesn&rsquo;t care about it,&rsquo; explaining that government policies systematically deny jobs to Afrikaners on the basis of their ethnicity.</p>
<p>According to an April 9, 2002, BBC article, <b>a woman born in South Africa has a greater chance of being raped than learning how to read</b>. In a June 20, 2009, Time survey of <b>South African men, one in four admitted to being a rapist</b>, making the country the rape capital of the world. In a survey of schoolchildren in the Soweto township, <b>one in four boys said that &#8216;jackrolling,&rsquo; a South African term for recreational gang rape, was &#8216;fun,&rsquo;</b> according to a June 19, 1999, BBC article.</p>
<p>&#8216;The criminals in our country have more rights than the victims,&rsquo; Rensburg said. &#8216;If someone is breaking into my home, I have to wait until he&rsquo;s three meters from me before he&rsquo;s threatening my life. Then I have to fire a warning shot before I am allowed to shoot him. I am not allowed to shoot him in the back, so if my husband walked in on a guy raping me, my husband could not shoot him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Walk onto any college campus in America and you can find students who admirably work against genocide in the Congo, Uganda or Rwanda. As citizens of one of the most generous nations on earth, we&rsquo;ll stand up for people halfway around the world we&rsquo;ve never met. So why is no one standing up for the Afrikaners?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/T6Hi2" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/T6Hi2</a></p>
<p>Kiddies from Wise, can you answer the writer&rsquo;s last question?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give you a moment&hellip;..</p>
<p>I knew you&rsquo;d need help: NO ONE IS STANDING UP FOR THE AFRIKANERS <b><i>BECAUSE THE AFRIKANERS ARE WHITE!</i></b></p>
<p>White Genocide is being accomplished not only by flooding all white countries with non-whites, which will interbreed us out of existence (see UnclePen #35 above for the Darwinian details), but is also being accomplished by outright slaughter!</p>
<p>Get a clue, kiddies from Wise!</p>

<p>There may be something to Asians doing better in school compared to Whites. <br>
I sure can tell a difference from how it used to be. </p>
<p>It used to be, that white children had a father who supported the family and a mother, who made a home for them. Children used to be well raised, polite, doing good in school. Schools were not madhouses and dumbed down to the lowest. <br>
White children now increasingly have one parent, instead of studying, doing chores, riding their bikes in the neighbourhood, etc. they watch stupid TV shows, play stupid computer games, listen to stupid rap music and other noise and have lost our good standards in the course of time.  Nothing comes from nothing, white children do not work half as hard for what they accomplish. If they studied as hard as Asiens you would not see them for dust. <br>

		<p>I am a middle school teacher at a school that&rsquo;s 80 percent Asian (about three-quarters of those Asians are Chinese; the rest are Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese). </p>
<p>My Asian students are not only high achieving, but EXTREMELY polite and respectful. Teenage rebellion is UNHEARD of in their culture. My white students can get chatty and slightly rebellious but nothing compared to the stuff you see that goes on in inner-city Black schools. </p>
<p>I would say that if the Asian percentage of the population were to increase to 20 percent of the U.S., the American tax base would go up, the crime rate would go down, and our shortage of scientists and engineers would disappear overnight.</p>
<p>The solution to China&rsquo;s overpopulation problem and low white birthrates would be to bring the Chinese to Western countries were they can become productive, hard working citizens. Another benefit is that Chinese don&rsquo;t coddle Blacks like liberal whites do. When, not if, the Chinese take over California, all the welfare and section 8 programs will be demolished, forcing the Black population to leave California for the liberal white northeastern states and midwest. California will once again, become a prosperous nation.</p>

<p>Well Lindsay I would like to ask you honest question. Your relatives, if they are typical, probably came to the USA around 1900. Your ancestors did not want to immigrate to India, China, or Brazil. They overwhelmingly chose to come to a White created and dominated society. Now there was a great many Anglos who were against allowing anymore Jews into the country. Primarily because they said your group would disrupt the social order. Now 110 years later your group has been over represented in all things that promoted radical change to the USA. Especially things having to do with the promotion of non-Whites. <br>
Now my questions? Why did your group want to come to a White dominated country, if all groups are equal as you claim? Second question do you blame, some of us Whites for feeling our ancestors were correct in warning us about letting to much of your group in?<br>
I ask these question in all sincerity.</p>

		<p>There are some light-brown/olive-skinned Indian and Jewish women, and some pretty white-skinned Chinese girls, that white men will find attractive, without wishing to have their babies.<br>
Though they are all dark-haired and dark-eyed, they can have gracile physiques and a feminine (not feminist) charm that European women often lack.  Of course, this is to compare the best with the best; the most attractive of Chinese and Japanese girls have longer than average legs and more European noses.<br>
White men will also find some mulatto women attractive, because their lips and nostrils are more prominently sensual, their eyes wider and their buttocks more protruberant; all mating signals,<br>
with a light &#8220;tan&#8221; colouring to spice the exotic appeal. Their heels are not so attractive. The &#8220;British&#8221; pop-star Alesha Dixon is a good example.<br>
I am not in favour of cross-breeding, but do not dismiss these factors.  <br>
There is no doubt that black men seek white women, and the entertainment media and commercial advertising (e.g. bedroom furniture, wedding outfits) promote this pairing.  It is a fatal conjunction between evolved female nordic beauty and perceived ultra-masculinity in muscle-power and genitalia, culturally reinforced by black experience in sweet-talk and dancing.<br>
Young white males should reclaim our young white girls, and our older men should stop importing south-east Asian women as wives aka domestic servants.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Ignorant comments must not be ignored&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right so every time someone suggests &#8220;white racism&#8221;, be sure to remind them about the real racism (physical assaults) committed against Whites by non-whites and follow that up with all the privileges (Affirmative Action, Government and Business set-asides, SBA set-asides, etc.) every single non-white race gets while the White Man gets nothing.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to remind them about all the fake hate crimes non-whites commit either.  You might want to thrown in all the Federal Funding all the non-white race groups get too.</p>
<p>If they dare mention Slavery, invoke Anthony Johnson.</p>
<p>There are TONS of examples to throw in their face.</p>
<p>They have non-white History Months but White People have none.</p>
<p>They have their own News Channels but not White People.</p>
<p>They have Chambers of Commerce and Caucuses and we have none.</p>
<p>Non-whites get to claim race thereby giving themselves &#8220;minority&#8221; status but White People are lumped together and counted as one.</p>
<p>Whites are officially the Minority now yet non-whites are still the &#8220;minority&#8221;.</p>
<p>Non-whites get to have their &#8220;culture&#8221; taught in Publicly Funded American Schools but no classes about White Culture.</p>

<p>It is as I suspected and now you&rsquo;ve confirmed it. You are a supremacist and white-hating racist.</p>
<p>Advocacy is for yourself and every ethnic/racial group except whites.</p>
<p>No problem if Hispanics want to organize and proclaim:  &#8220;For our race everything; for everyone else, nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or blacks wish to spew anti-white venom or freely assault and kill us   &mdash;   hey, no problem!  You&rsquo;ll make sure black-on-white crimes are covered up, won&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;ll make sure blacks are NEVER accused of hate crimes because that&rsquo;s not possible, is it?  Only whites are capable of hate crimes and hate speech according to the DOJ.</p>
<p>But if WHITES want to advance our interests to stop white genocide?</p>
<p><b>Well&hellip;that&rsquo;s different</b>, right Mz. weiss?  Any time whites organize it must be stopped lest the ovens be fired up, right?  Whites ONLY organize for supremacist reasons, to goose step in the streets for round- ups, right?  Every white secretly longs for a Fourth Reich, for Hitler to return, am I not correct, Mz. weiss?</p>
<p>Therefore, it is up to you and others of your ilk to rally Blacks, Browns and Asians against &#8220;white supremacists&#8221; to make sure we don&rsquo;t have the same First Amendment or Freedom of Assembly rights you and every other ethnic or racial group enjoys in the US.   You&rsquo;ll make sure the big guns are notified in the SPLC and ADL to shut down white meetings such as the American Renaissance conference, make sure hotels and their employees threatened so they won&rsquo;t host our conference.</p>
<p>You will also make sure that the US is flooded with third world destitute so whites will not longer be a majority, right?  THAT is your main goal.  AND, you&rsquo;ll make sure that when the United States becomes one more third world country, that whites are blamed for the misery.  What do you care?  You&rsquo;ll have long left.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a short thread now to the original article, with some good posts. Here&rsquo;s four I liked, beginning with Jared Taylor&rsquo;s. (My boldfacing in all that follows):<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
I salute the Cavalier for running the ad for our website, AmRen.com. In my experience, despite the constant praise for diversity that is common on university campuses, <b>the one kind of diversity that gets short shrift is the most important: diversity of ideas</b>. A college education should acquaint students with a broad variety of views, but most campuses suffer from a stifling conformity.</p>
<p>I fear, however, that the editorial board of The Highland Cavalier has not taken its own advice to students about visiting our web page and reflecting on it. By no means can we be called &ldquo;white supremacist.&rdquo; That is an emotion-laden term meant to label someone as beyond the reach of reason or morality and to shut down debate.</p>
<p>There are strong arguments to be made against the idea that diversity is a strength, and I always find it ironic that the promoters of diversity are so afraid of hearing them.</p>
<p>I challenge anyone on campus to a public debate on this question. <b>If I am wrong or misguided, should I not be easy to refute? If I am right should I not be heard?</b></p>
<p>Jared Taylor, President<br>
New Century Foundation<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been easier to simply state why racial and ethnic diversity is a strength? No such explanation was furnished because such diversity is not a strength. <b>Unity is a strength. It is ethnic unity that makes nations strong</b>, not ethnic diversity.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
&lsquo;Diversity&rsquo; in the context of race and ethnicity is not a strength. It is a source of constant conflict, inequality and tribalism. When &lsquo;diverse&rsquo; countries succeed it&rsquo;s despite their ethnic diversity – not because of it.</p>
<p>There is no academic study anywhere that shows it as a &lsquo;strength&rsquo;. Therefore those who claim otherwise are subscribing to <b>faith-based politics</b> – that which has no supporting evidence.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
New Century Foundation is not a &lsquo;white supremacist&rsquo; organization. It is a white civil rights organization! We are a group of pro-white activists and white community organizers. We are working to organize the white community. I describe myself as a civil rights activist working to overcome bigotry, racism, and discrimination against white people.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
You have already decided for your readers exactly what they should think and feel. To have a debate about any issue, you have to allow people to choose their own viewpoint. Why, according to you, is Amren a &ldquo;white supremacist&rdquo; publication? Do they support White people&rsquo;s rights? Do they think White people should have their own voice like every other race group in America? What exactly is it that makes them &ldquo;white supremacist&rdquo;? Your opinion?</p>
<p>If you truly want to give your readers the real option to choose, I would suggest dropping the higher than mighty act and publish the advertisement without saying they are ignorant or giving your internal thoughts on the matter. Let your readers decide. After all, if Amren is ignorant, surely that would come through without your condemnation. Right?<br>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know of any White women who have plastic surgery to look Asian:</p>
<p><b>Asian Patients Seeking Plastic Surgery To Appear More &#8216;Western&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>A growing trend has Asian patients of all ages, from the middle-aged to adolescents, seeking out plastic surgery in an effort to make themselves appear more &#8220;Western,&#8221; CNN is reporting. </p>
<p>Nose-reshaping, facial contouring and eyelid surgery are among the most popular procedures in Seoul, a city which has become a tourist destination for newly-rich, globally-competitive Asian patients seeking a more European look. And it&rsquo;s not just appearance that matters: some Korean mothers are having a part of their children&rsquo;s tongue muscles surgically snipped to ensure better English pronunciation. </p>
<p>&#8220;They can find a much better job if they have a pretty face,&#8221; says Dr. Kim Byung Gun, a Seoul-based surgeon, who says foreign patents comprise 30 percent of his clientele. Of that 30 percent, he notes 90 percent are Chinese. </p>
<p>One mother cites Asia&rsquo;s competitive drive as the primary reason she&rsquo;s bringing her daughter to get eyelid surgery. &#8220;Yes, I think it&rsquo;ll help her,&#8221; Jang Hyu Hye says. &#8220;This is a society where you have to be pretty to get ahead.

<p>&ldquo;In the end beauty is a relative concept &amp; simply lies in the eyes of the beholder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is true. Asians of course would consider their own features to be the most attractive as would every other race. </p>
<p>Beauty is an absolute.  What is relative and in the eyes of the beholder is some one&rsquo;s individual taste.  Some one may find Grace Kelly more beautiful that Elisabeth Taylor, but no one will claim that they are not both beautiful.  White women and men are the most beautiful creature on earth.  That is why anti-Western Modern Art servers up so many grotesque White women.</p>
<p>The proof that beauty is a universal attribute is that its opposite is also universal.  Asians and White people will agree that a particular Asian woman is ugly, and that another particular Asian woman is not ugly.</p>
<p>Can there be a more attractive Asian woman than a particular White woman? Yes, but your true beautiful women are always White with their glorious color combinations of skin, eyes, and hair putting them beyond comparison.</p>
<p>I think the claims that White women are not the most beautiful and sought after creatures on earth is driven by the envy and spite of women that are not attractive.  Envy the same motive that drives so much anti-White rhetoric.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;dumb blond&rdquo; fraud is a Hollywood creation, as is so much other anti-White propaganda.  Blonds, not bleached blonds, are more intelligent as a group, than their darker haired rivals.<br>

		<p>To Dan post 116.  Though it is not my opinion that Asian females are more beautiful (or LESS) than European females, British women<br>
in a survey rated Indian Women as more beautiful than other women INCLUDING themselves.(&#8216;Uk women least likely to care what men think&rsquo; The telegraph). The survy asked women from  12 countries which country would they considered to have the most beautiful women. All chose women from their countries as having the most beautiful women. However, British women considered Indian women more beautiful than themselves. </p>
<p>Dan wrote &rsquo; Whites have higher standard deviation in IQ scores (18 SD vs 12 SD &#8221; Jensen&hellip;)&rsquo;&hellip;. meaning there are far more White geniuses than Asian geniuses</p>
<p>Many considered Professor Arthur Jensen studies on IQ to be<br>
fictitious . </p>
<p> All the articles and books that I read about IQ put the standard deviation for whites at 15 not 18. I doubt that the Asian standard deviation is 12 . But if we used 12 for Asian vs 15 for whites, both groups would have the same percentage of genius  if the average for whites is 99 and 105 for East Asian (Lynn not necessarily my view that Whites is 99 and East Asian IQ is 105) . <br>
Since the genius level is at an IQ of 140 and above, only whites and East Asians who are 3 standard deviations above their respective means would be considered geniuses, an IQ of 141 (105+36) for East Asian and 144 for whites (99 +45). Only 0.15 percent of the population of either group would be  geniuses. But since there are 1.4 billion East Asians Vs 1 billion whites in the world, there would be more geniuses who are East Asians.</p>
<p>I dont see the evidence that East Asian IQs are closer to their mean than Whites and thus there are more whites who are geniuses<br>
(but have more Morons than Asians)than East Asians. <br>
Many have discredited Jensen studies on IQ.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the students, in their assignment to think about the strengths of diversity, have the courage to also consider its <br>
consequences. The courage to admit to themselves that the responses they&rsquo;ve seen here at Amren are reflections of the <br>
consequences of the very same, fatally-flawed &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; dogma that&rsquo;s being force fed to them. </p>
<p>Do they really accept that somehow we&rsquo;re the rotten apples of society? The bad, evil, hateful people of the world?  Isn&rsquo;t that a little too convenient, especially for people who seem rather articulate, maybe even well-educated?  As convenient as, say, the one-sided &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; dogma that doesn&rsquo;t allow for any other possibilities, even the humble possibility that perhaps diversity isn&rsquo;t *always* a strength? </p>
<p>Have they considered the possibility that Amren&rsquo;s supporters represent the people that this dogma has failed? We are the evidence of its failure!   We are the evidence that what they call &#8220;diversity&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t include whites as equals. It <br>
includes and tolerates whites, but only if they agree to relinquish several things that are encouraged in and afforded to non-whites: </p>
<p>*Pride in their racial identity without demonization, <br>
*The right to take active steps to preserve their heritage and  values without demonization, <br>
*The right to not be the targets of racial discrimination by the government and the right to organize politically with the <br>
express intent of furthering their ethnic interests, preserving their heritage and preserving the nations we live in for *our* benefit.  </p>
<p>Would the white students say that they are encouraged in the same exact, totally-equal fashion as their non-white counterparts? </p>
<p>If they think this is true, then I&rsquo;d encourage them to start an all-white group on campus to test that theory.  Have they ever asked their superiors why every other ethnic group could form a group like this without a problem or objection, but only whites cannot?  </p>
<p>Again, if somewhere in this rosy idea of &#8220;diversity is strength&#8221; there is the implication that every racial group is equal, then why have different rules for whites than everyone else?  And not just different rules, but rules and common practices specifically adapted and put in place to disempower whites?</p>

<p>Magnificent post!</p>
<p>You have your topic nailed intellectually, emotionally, and stylistically!</p>
<p>&#8220;You will also make sure that the US is flooded with third world destitute so whites will not longer be a majority, right? THAT is your main goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>When two distinct subspecies are mixed together in nature, they interbreed until all distinction between them has disappeared. The White race will not only lose its majority but will lose its very existence, as we see already happening in the increasing number of mixed children.</p>
<p>No one is demanding that Japan open its borders to a flood of non-Japanese who will mix the Japanese out of existence.</p>
<p>No one is demanding that China open its borders to a flood of non-Chinese who will mix the Chinese out of existence.</p>
<p>But any White who protests the opening of White borders to a flood of non-Whites who will mix Whites out of existence is a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.</p>
<p>The purposeful opening of White borders that will result in the elimination of Whites is by U.N. definition a genocide. The people carrying out this White Genocide claim to just be anti-racist, but what they are is anti-White.</p>

<p>You make some good points, clearly other racial sub-groups are capable of creating and sustaining civilizations. I have lived for short periods in both Hong Kong and in Singapore as well as South Africa. However, the level of civilization is an important consideration and every racial sub-group has more or less capability in this regard relative to other groups. I have lived in different cities in North America and now live in a very multicultural London UK and have observed that these racial sub-groups always stratify economically in the same pattern in these cities as is indeed is the the case with their heritage countries. Some good thought provoking work you should refer to are the two books by professors Lynn and Vanhanen: IQ and the Wealth of Nations and IQ and Global Inequality. Here is the Wikipedia piece on this and you can go from there if it piques your interest: </p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/QdLo" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/QdLo</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think many people here will argue with this. </p>
<p>The debate you started regarding the history of these civilizations is an ongoing and interesting one, and one that is certainly not restricted to this site. You may want to refer to Charles Murray&rsquo;s: History of Human Accomplishment, which directly and indirectly speaks to this debate. </p>
<p>The point you have not addressed is how the US and indeed the Western World is going to sustain it&rsquo;s civilization by importing groups in large numbers who by the evidence do not have the &#8220;relative&#8221; civilizational capabilities as the settling peoples. This is a huge issue and one that has immense (understatement) implications if addressed honestly. As does their relative underperformance when already here. </p>
<p>Regarding the educational outperformance you mentioned in respect to only two racial sub-groups: Indians and Chinese/Korean/Japanese, not to mention that of your own group, the Ashkenazi Jews. Obviously IQ is at play here and the Ashkenazi Jews have very high averages, witness their disproportionate rate of winning Nobel Prizes. The other two groups have IQ&rsquo;s pretty close to the White average when one lumps southern Europeans with northern Europeans, Northern europeans have been tested above 100 (Holland, Germany&hellip;). </p>
<p>My own belief is that western liberalism (modern day, not classical liberalism) has a great deal to do with what many have commented are falling standards, or conversely the &#8220;outperformance&#8221; you refer to. I have seen it with my own eyes, bright young people I grew up with have lost the desire to excel in a world &#8220;where everything is the same&#8221;. I, myself got caught up in this, not caring about school and preferring to spend my time on the ice hockey rink and fishing. I became not so much a conservative as an anti-liberal and ended up with two Master&rsquo;s degrees, which got me to London UK. In the firt one, it was full of chinese/jewish people and I scored out at the top of the class. So my question to you is have you asked yourself why  this outperformance occurs? Is it a softening in our collective drive, and if so where does it come from? I believe it is the effects of liberalism and the &#8220;everyone is equal&#8221; leading to focus too much of our redistributed resources on those who can&rsquo;t be equal (harsh but true). We not stream bright students anymore because of the racial disparities which quickly become apparent and add even more fuel to the fire with affirmative action. Why do Ashkenazis almost uniformly support this liberalism but do not practice it themselves. A liberalism which is the cornerstone of multicultural immigration and the illusion that all people are equal, even though your own group&rsquo;s results clearly show otherwise? What level of civilization do you want for your own children?  Do you think you can remain insulated forever from the problems of groups that act like an anchor to our civilizational trajectory?</p>

another funny thing about ignorance is that ignorance basically means something like &#8220;not knowing about facts&#8221; and especially being &#8220;unaware&#8221;. <br>
a sophisticated racialist is not unaware of the fact that there exist social mechanisms that cause differences between different people, such social mechanism which have nothing to do with genetical differences. But additional he thinks that genetical differences also have their impact. racialist doesn´t think nature instead of nurture, but rather nature and nurture at the same time. <br>

<p>One thing I can say to you is that you certainly got a lot of attention on this article and as you can see there was a minimum of nastiness on our part.</p>
<p>I hope that some day you&rsquo;ll understand the value of your (our) culture and I pray that you never have to experience the down side of diversity when you&rsquo;re walking down the streets of any number of American cities.<br>
Your thorough indoctrination in the evils of your fellow White people has led you to adopt a mentality that puts you in harm&rsquo;s way. There were <br>
three other young, lovely Jewish- American girls who had a fatal lesson in the wonders of interaction with Afros.  Their names were Eve Carson, Lauren Burk and Amy Biehl. <br>
Googe them.</p>

		<p>Diversity?  It would be helpful for the campus journalists to<br>
consider that facts are not racist or supremicist or sexist.  Values are an issue for debate once the &#8220;stipulation of facts&#8221;<br>
is attained. But it is never attained.  It might be productive for AR to edit down portions of back issues that taken together would have promise of being a campus primer  &mdash;  the moreso, if some students and recent students could preface it all with brief personal accounts of &#8220;How I saw the Light&#8221;.   Students on campus are far more likely to doubt  the campus blather about biological  gender equality than they are to question of the delusions about biological racial equality.   Sartre ( in his praises of Fidel Castro )comments:  &#8220;Human beings are everywhere and always equal&#8221; .  This is a revealing dialetical assertion of  basic Marxian idealism.  But to try to attain such idealism by voiding out of discussion and awareness the relevant facts of science is to suggest the PC campus &#8220;leadership&#8221;  has no basic confidence in its own values.     </p>

I would say that if the Asian percentage of the population were to increase to 20 percent of the U.S., the American tax base would go up, the crime rate would go down, and our shortage of scientists and engineers would disappear overnight.</p>
<p> <br>
I can&rsquo;t believe it, I can&rsquo;t believe it. And this from a teacher. </p>
<p>we  need more Asiens!!!. I would say, more Asien teachers. </p>
<p>AS things are, the chances that whites clean up their act, toss out their stupid TVs, get their heads on straight and look in the mirror and realize themselves to be what they have been, are slim. Yes, get in more Asiens to do the jobs that Whites used to do better, and Whites can clean toilets. Heaven help us all. </p>
<p>You are a teacher #19, do you do one cotton picking thing to help the white students, to maybe look over the rim and see reality? <br>

<p>Fact about India Ms. brainwashed Lindsey Weiss.  Not one new sewer has been built in india since the British left.  No sewers have been extended.  About 10 years ago the public health service of Peru caught an outbreak of cholera.</p>
<p>Peru seems to have a good public health service, so it was an outbreak, not an epidemic.  The cholera came across the pacific <br>

<p>Are you at all aware of what the Chinese goverment did to its culture, monuments, libraries and art between 1948 and 1990?</p>
<p>Mass destruction.  Among other things, during the late 1960&rsquo;s early 1070&rsquo;s cultural revolution the Chinese destroyed the entire Confucious museum.  This would be like the Catholics destroying the Christian shrines in Jerusalem and Palestine, the Vatican and every shrine in Europe.</p>

		<p>Englemann stated that modern arab egyptians are descended from ancient egyptians.  He is wrong.  Recent DNA studies posted on this website have proved that there is no ancient egyptian DNA in modern egyptians.</p>
<p>There are some descendants of ancient inhabitants of iraq in syria and iraq.  They are called assyrian Christians.  They live in syria nd iraq, but they are not related to the muslim descendants of the arabs who invaded 650 to 700.</p>
<p>That glorius period of arab muslim civilization Engelmann constantly refers to lasted from 700 to 1100. During those 400 years at least half the population were still productive Christians.  The muslim arabs 700 to 1100 lived on what had been achieved by persian, egypt, rome, byzantium and other great civilizations of the area.</p>
<p>After 400 years of living on past achievements but achieving nothing of their own muslim arab civilization fell into the dump it is in today.</p>
<p>Why do you think the arabs constantly raided Europe for slaves?<br>
They needed Christian tradesmen because they couldn&rsquo;t do much for themselves.  </p>
<p>There is a famous city in persia, Qom.  It is like the vatican of shiite islam.  Most of the seminaries of persia are there.

<p>Sonehenge is more of a feat because it is built of solid blocks of stone about 4 stories high.  The pyramdids were built of individual blocks of stone more easily handled.</p>

<p>Coptic Christian Student Murdered By Classmates for Wearing a Cross [Egypt]<br>

(AINA)   &mdash;   In mid-October Egyptian media published news of an altercation between Muslim and Christian students over a classroom seat at a school in Mallawi, Minya province. The altercation lead to the murder of a Christian student. The media portrayed the incident as non-sectarian. However, Copts Without Borders, a Coptic news website, refuted this version and was first to report that the Christian student was murdered because he was wearing a crucifix. &#8220;We wanted to believe the official version,&#8221; said activist Mark Ebeid, &#8220;because the Coptic version was a catastrophe, as it would take persecution of Christians also to schools.&#8221;&hellip; </p>

		<p>Some here want to convince Lindsey Weiss to see the light.  I postulate that this effort is a fool&rsquo;s errand.  She demonstrates a circumscribed mental defect.  Circumstantial evidence suggests that this defect is shared by many in the SPLC and ADL. Unfortunately Mother Nature has surrounded this defect with a pseudonormal masquerade.  This defect is not currently amenable to repair.  It seems to be most intractable.  In the same sense that reasoning with an angry wolverine wouldn&rsquo;t be productive, reasoning with LW will be similarly unproductive.  Her mental defect won&rsquo;t allow her to grasp reality.  How else can you explain her holding up China and India as models for America after viewing the links on Bon&rsquo;s post #97? (BTW, excellent research Bon).  Instead of allowing ourselves to be demonized, we need to reverse the initiative, and demonize her destructive aberrant instincts.  </p>
<p>After reading the SPLC critique of Pat Buchanan&rsquo;s recent book, it struck me that I hadn&rsquo;t ever seen such a concentration of the word &#8220;extreme&#8221; and its variations in the 100000 or so hours of reading in my life.  Talk about demonization.</p>

		<p>Exactly Dick Whitman, and that is why whites will in the end be forced to assert their rights and defend their very survival through bullets, bombs and weapons of mass death and destruction. We are being shut out of all legtimate and peaceful means to secure our collective futures, whih will force us to resort to merciless and incredibly brutal and goal driven violence. All whites living today and those yet to be born will have to take a page from Ghenghis Khan, Vlad Dracula and the Romans because our enemies intend to exterminate us. It will be our time to return the favor, or at least make our demise as costly and hellish for them as possible. Maybe we will have to invoke a &#8220;Sampson Option&#8221; of our own.</p>

		<p>Now my questions? Why did your group want to come to a White dominated country, if all groups are equal as you claim? Second question do you blame, some of us Whites for feeling our ancestors were correct in warning us about letting to much of your group in?</p>
<p><br>
I noticed Lindsay Weiss did not answer my questions. I believe it is because like any totally brainwashed person, when someone ask questions out of their narrow rehearsed brainwashed answers, they cannot answer so they just ignore the questions.<br>
I must say I find it infuriating that someone&rsquo;s ancestors come to this very land because of the highly advanced and tolerant culture the Whites had built. Then a couple of generations later their offspring attacks us as intolerant and no better than other of the world&rsquo;s races though her ancestors would not have thought of immigrating to those other races. countries.<br>
I think it is called Chutzpah!</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Modern Arabs are at least in part descended from those who originated civilization in Egypt and what is now Iraq five thousand years ago. Back then Courtney, your European ancestors and mine were still living in the stone age. &#8220;</p>
<p>You might call it Stone Age, but it was not people living in caves and dragging women around by the hair.  After the last Ice Age, when ALL people had lived in more southern climes, some went north.  Some archeologists consider the most bold from Persia (Indo Europeans) were the same ones who built the Persian civilizations and then pushed west and north.  Certainly, Persians are not the same people today as they were then.  </p>
<p>Europe was full of societies that built with stone, but even Egypt did that!  I advise you to review Northern European archeology a bit.  I&rsquo;ve been at Stonehenge.  People had organized societies and Stonehenge and many other similar structures all over Europe show that they knew math and astrophysics well enough to predict solar events equal to and perhaps even exceeding Egypt&rsquo;s, and plan their lives around it. The Halstadt culture in Central Europe is a good one to study.  The remains on the Orkneys in Britain show complex planning.  They wouldn&rsquo;t have been just stones, but full of comforts that didn&rsquo;t survive the ages.  (I&rsquo;d rather have a stone home than the wooden framed matchbox I have a huge mortgage on today!)  </p>
<p>The British Isles and Gaul, Spain, all of Western Europe had civilized culture, although smaller in population and perhaps poorer due to the harshness of the climates.  Archeological finds in Europe have shown that people had iron, and copper smelting knowledge and made bronze at the same time as the Minoans, who are considered Europeans and Crete part of Europe.  One researcher discovered that they had a geometric system that used what he dubbed, &#8220;The Megalithic Yard,&#8221; as its standard of measuring for building (In Britain).  The only difference between Egypt, other Mediterranean civilizations, and many locales in Northern Europe was weather, which made living far more difficult.  The other difference is records evidenced by the survival of written records.  Since preserving hides and paper making in such cold, wet climates was far more difficult, much potential history has been lost.  Knowledge of the Mediterranean world existed, the archeological proofs of this are long, but too complex to roll off here.  Northern Europe was described by conquering &#8220;civilized&#8221; armies from the south.  That process was repeated, took centuries to complete,and reached its zenith when the Christians came north and destroyed all history and records of the white peoples they conquered into conversion. During the long period of erosion from attacks from the south, the Northern Europeans were pushed further and further into poverty and their cultures and societies suffered.  Gibbon, among other classic historians, show that the arrival of Christianity caused high illiteracy as lay people were forbidden to read or own the one approved book (in Italy, and then all of Europe).  I don&rsquo;t need to write (but I will) that Christianity came from the Middle East and from people who are likely as related to Egyptians as modern Arabs, perhaps more?  Arabs were located in the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi) until the explosion of Islam which is also properly termed &#8220;The Arab Wars of Expansion&#8221; which took place in the 7th century, long after the glory of Egypt.  Assuming that lack of remnants or the reports of outsiders reflects reality is as clumsy as saying that all the buildings in China were roofed in gold.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;Chinese civilization begins with the Xia Dynasty in 2100 BC. At about this time the Mycenaean civilization began on Greece, but most of Europe was still neolithic. Some Europeans remained paleolithic until five thousand years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>What?  Most of China was also primitive at that time, if you mean modern China, and we must take it that way, because you are dividing up Europe, and Greece produced far more technology and knowledge than China.  Add to this, the Minoan civilization is as old as Egypt&rsquo;s and was a Bronze Age civilization that is known to have existed as early as the 27th century BC!  But modern man still builds with stone. In fact, our most important buildings are built of stone today and right here in America.  While living in Europe, I discovered that in Spain, a cave home is coveted. It turns out that Spain has a region where the stone is easy to carve and people have built the most amazing and comfortable homes there!</p>
<p>&#8220;The height of Arab civilization can be dated from the life of Mohammed in the seventh century, to the Mongolian conquests in the thirteenth century. During that time Western Europe experienced the Dark Ages. Literacy almost ceased to exist. &#8220;</p>
<p>The Arabs took over civilizations, they did not create them.  Their conquest is superficially sometimes called &#8220;civilized&#8221; because Mohamed wanted to capture cities and its citizens intact.  He was a merchant and his religion was based on slave trading and the idea of living from (or off) subordinate peoples.  Their knowledge was Greek and Hellenic Jewish derived.  That is why the &#8220;Arab civilization&#8221; didn&rsquo;t last long.  Islam began to grind it down from the start, until today, where we see its results. As for the charge that literacy almost ceased to exist in Europe, I refer to my above explanation and charge, Europe was dominated by a religion that came from the Middle East, so it does not reflect upon Europeans as they did not invent it, but were subdued into it.  And that strikes me as we see today, another even more barbaric religion is set to subdue Europe, and this time exterminate Europeans.</p>
<p>I apologize for this long post.  However, I hate how so many posters as this one make such generalized conclusions from so little data so often.</p>

		<p>47 |&#8221;&hellip; As for Singapore - its the world&rsquo;s cleanest, technologically proficient &amp; a nation which is near perfect especially after the high IQ Han Chinese &amp; Southern Indians (Tamils) took over and created the most perfect nation on Earth &hellip;&#8221; ( Lindsey Weiss)</p>
<p><br>
I am afraid that there&rsquo;re several false elements there.</p>
<p>Firstly, Singapore becoming Singapore we know today is because of the Han Chinese (with positive assitance of English Common Wealth Law)  &mdash;   the same as HK, not the minority Indians by a long shot. All ethnic Indian ( or Indian majority / or large minority) country in the world are 3rd world cesspits, let alone remotely close to the class of Singapore. </p>
<p>In fact the minority Southern Indians (and Malays) are the net drag for Singapore. Next-door Malaysia with majority Malays, far more ethnic Southern Indians and far less ethnic Chinese in comparison, is the perfect example; whereas impoverished Burma and Indonesia (both are packed of far more ethnic Indians) at further south are the extreme ones.</p>
<p>Likewise, most of 20,000 ethnic Indians (many are Tamils) who are Hong Kong citizens are 1-man convinient shop owners, hotel doormen and tiny hostels operators in HK. Any budget backpacker to HK must know that the only 3rd world part of entire HK is the (in)famous &#8220;Chung King Mansions&#8221; at the tip of central Kowloon   &mdash;   shoddy skyscrapers consisting of thousands of filthest, smellest and cheapest &#8220;hostel&#8221; cells mostly owned and operated by ethnic Indians in HK.  </p>
<p>Singapore&rsquo;s Lee Kuan Yew has repeatedly warned that the living standard of Singapore would inevitablely decline as soon as the Chinese lose the majority vís-a-vís Malays and Indians in the country - pretty much like the timebombs of today&rsquo;s USA, Canada, AND Australia. </p>
<p>Secondly, Singapore is multicultural due to inevitable historical reasons, not deliberate design. Singapore&rsquo;s multiracial issue is also a timebomb in fact. Lee Kuan Yew realised that since the beginning.  He has been so worried about the issue that the most govenement polices of Singapore have been carefully designed by him to control Indian and Malay population while maintaining ethnic Chinese brith rate since DAY ONE.   ALL key govenement decison-makers, being policy or economics related of Singapore are ethnic Chinese, with a few token ethnic Malays and Indians as a PC gusture, since Singapore has a merit-based system, no AA. </p>
<p>Again, Singapore&rsquo;s preferred immigrants are Hong Kong and mainland Chinese, followed by ethnic Europeans, not Indians or Malays if having a chooce. Lee Kuan Yew is a renowned HBDer,very well versed on issues such as IQ by the way.</p>
<p>In my view any ethnic Northeast Asian or European country with no or very very limited and highly selected immgration would prosper in the long run. Multiculti is a fantastic recipe for corruption, poverty and unrest.</p>

<p>I wonder which Singapore you are referring to in your post? As a Singaporean citizen myself of Dutch and Han Chinese extraction, I can attest to the fact that Indian Chinese are some of the best educated and wealthiest communities. Infact according to the 2005 National census of Singapore - Indian (Tamil) Singaporeans outscore all other residents including Han Chinese in terms of per capita income and education achievement.  In 2005, both the average and median monthly income for Indian Residents (S$3,660 and $2,480 respectively) exceeded those for all Residents (S$3,500 and S$2,410 respectively). In the same year, 25% of Indian Residents had a university degree as their highest qualification attained. In contrast the national average was only 17%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those Indians who did reach the &#8216;A&rsquo; level and sat for this exam marginally outperformed the national average. 93% of Indians received 2 &#8216;A&rsquo; and 2 &#8216;AO&rsquo; level passes, compared with 92.6% among Chinese students, and 92.3% nationally.</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/j1AcD" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/j1AcD</a></p>
<p>Last but not least, the very word Singa-pore - is derived from the Tamil ( Indian) word &#8220;Singam&#8221; - Lion &amp; &#8220;Pur&#8221; - Town. Thats why the national symbol of Singapore is the Lion headed totem as depicted by the famous Singapore lion fountain. Historically, Singapore was first colonized &amp; civilized by the Tamil ( Indian) kingdom of the &#8220;Cholas&#8221;. It were the Cholas who made this idle fishing village into a significant trading post. Even today that legacy has continued - Singapore&rsquo;s main economic icon is it&rsquo;s fabulous trade post. While the Han Chinese maybe the most dominant ethnicity today in terms of overall population &amp; socio-economic power - the Tamils do indeed need a special mention.</p>

<p>As HK Chinese with part of family in the region, I visit Singapore quite often. </p>
<p>On your note: are you aware that quoting wiki pages is unreliable to say the least?  According to some wiki pages with dodgy &#8220;HK official sources&rdquo;, some even formally (read: hilariously) claim that ethnic Indians in HK (roughly 20,000 out of 7 million total HK population) &#8220;control more than 10% of HK&rsquo;s export&#8221; which is an astronomical figure. One just can&rsquo;t  stopping laughing after reading such blatant lies, as most Indians we know are dedicated in 7/11 convenient stores, mom &amp; pop restaurants, tailor shops and hostels in HK, just like in the UK. </p>
<p>Rule #1 : no Indian community could out-score the Han Chinese counterpart in any age group anywhere under the sun ( being in the UK, North America, Australia, anywhere in Europe, South East Asia, or South Africa, the Caribbean &hellip; you name it&hellip;perhaps only except in India itself) under NORMAL circumstances, which mean provided that the communities are statistically large enough, samplings are apple-apple comparable,  and tests are strict enough (e.g. no cheating involved) such as the ones in Singapore. </p>
<p>&#8220;Indians in Singapore outscore the Chinese?&#8221;  I mean really?  It&rsquo;s like claiming &#8220;the Blacks outscore the Whites in&hellip;wherever&#8221;   &mdash;   with the similar huge IQ gaps amongst these two pairs   &mdash;    just historically and genetically (i.e. IQ) impossible!  Thus the &#8220;figures&#8221; you quoted are just misleading rubbish, I am afraid.</p>
<p><br>
Rule #2: Income level has no 100% correlation with IQ as both research and common sense indicate, even though they are positively correlated.  It is because many social factors can artificially affect a group&rsquo;s average income (e.g. in extreme cases, certain ethnic (sub)groups of Columbia perhaps have the world-leading average income levels due to monopolising some good &#8220;grass &amp; powder&#8221;. This fact doesn&rsquo;t mean that Colombians have one of the highest IQ in the world, even though it shows that they are at least not dumb).</p>
<p>Therefore, SO WHAT if &#8221; the small minority Indians in Singapore have slightly higher average income than the majority Chinese&#8221; as you quoted?  It can be easily true or untrue. And what do you try to prove with that?  Nothing! It&rsquo;s almost meaningless in my context I am afraid, even assuming the &#8220;data&#8221; are correct.  </p>
<p>Worse still, &#8220;the finding&#8221; could be deliberately misleading: the same as a popular internet claim that &#8220;Indians are the highest average earning ethnic group in the US&#8221;, implying and &#8220;justifying&#8221; somehow that Indians in the US having the highest average IQ, without normalising so many factors both outside and in the stats that could be EASILY abused to achieve the &#8220;desired&#8221; outcome. All together they are just illogical media propaganda aiming at fooling the innocent public to blindly accept mass 3rd world immigration.</p>
<p>Good for you mentioning the meaning of Singapore, though.  Unfortunately this is the exact historical luggage that bothers Lee Guan Yew, akin to what bothers Amren&rsquo;s Jared Taylor.</p>

<p>Actually, Indians always outscore Chinese everywhere except SE Asia, Australia &amp; Canada. In the UK &amp; Europe: Indians have done very well in terms of wealth, education, industry, Science, Medicine, media &amp; entertainment. Whether its the Diamond Business in Antwerp, Belgium where Indians have beaten Hassidic Jews in the game to become the leading traders in Diamond &amp; Jewellery or the Wealthiest man in the UK ( also an Indian) to the numerous CEO&rsquo;s of leading brands in UK &amp; America from Pepsico,Bose,AppLabs, Mastercard, Cisco,Citigroup, Adobe etc. </p>
<p>The Chinese on the other hand are mostly seen in stereotypical occupations: Menial jobs, Small Chinese restaurants, laundry franchises &amp; blue collar labor. There are however a rising number of international students in the universities here in Europe from China. In the United States there have been some significant contributions by Chinese Americans in science but they pale in comparison to the Indians. Overall, in the west - its whites who lead in terms of contributions. </p>

<p>Excuse me! But IQ and wealth ARE co-related. Your rather unlettered conclusion that income level &amp; intelligence is un-related is pure balderdash. Thats why white countries have done so much better than Asian ones. And guess what, that is the reason millions of Chinese, Koreans and Indians want to come to our shores. Because we created a much better society. <br>
 Secondly, while I am no big fan of Asian Indians myself and yes I believe they are mostly fit the description you gave them in places like Hong Kong, however, what Penn said is absolutely true. Asian Indians in Europe &amp; America have done exceptionally well to rank as the most dominant &amp; formidable ethno-racial group in the field of Science, Medicine, technology, Business-Corporate world, Academics, Innovation and even the Entertainment industry ( I see a lot of Indian faces in the news media, music industry, modelling &amp; now even movies). The Chinese and other NE Asians on the other hand have not been as successful in this regard. I specifically mean in Europe &amp; the United States. Also in Singapore and Malaysia- many Indians have been succcessful. the owner of the tallest building there - Petronas Towers in Kula Lumpur is of Indian Malaysian Extraction.</p>

<p>1.Calm down, take a deep breath, then re-read my statement.  </p>
<p>Where did I say income and wealth are &ldquo;uncorrelated&rdquo;?  Where is your outrage?   Or you made it up yourself?</p>
<p>The two are positively correlated, as I said.  Yet, they are far less than 100% correlated, which means whenever passing a certain income threshold, a light difference in income bears NO underlying implication on the corresponding IQ levels whatsoever.  – Common sense, really.</p>
<p><br>
2.Indians in the EU, the UK and the US seem to be over-proportionally represented in high flyer carriers, yet NOT in ANY 3rd world countries where the same &ldquo;castes&rdquo; or &ldquo;class&rdquo; of the said Indians with far more numbers reside.   Ask yourself Why?  <br>
   <br>
&hellip; BECAUSE of the Selective-Immigration barrier that the West has put in place, which gives the public a false image that &ldquo;Indians have very high IQ&rdquo;, nothing further from the truth.</p>
<p>If the West have done Selective-Immigration to Nigeria instead of India, you world have thought all Nigerians are high IQ, too.  Yes, Nigeria has far less talents than India in its right side IQ bell curve, yet you could have still found many around.</p>
<p>What do you say then in such a case?  Nigeria is the new beacon of intelligence alongside India?</p>
<p>Chinese, or NE Asians, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do well compared with Indians in the West&rdquo; ( your word, not mine -  mine is another topic).   If it were true,  it would be because the vast majority of Han Chinese and NE Asians are nationalists residing and working inside our HOME countries contributing to our own success ( even some tiny minority of them immigrated to the West), unlike India where to live in the West is THE dream of most of her best and the brightest.</p>
<p>So does it really surprise anyone, for example in the US, that Indians&rsquo; average income and public image as you cited are good /better is due to the fact that they, or you if you are Indian, are OVER- propositionally represented by overwhelming amount of Indian H1B (or whatever name that is) visa holders (good IQ and &gt; medium income by default of such visa to start with), vís-a-vís NE Asians and the indigenous whites?</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the surprise there?  </p>
<p>Even so, overseas Han Chinese still outscore Indians, easily, in SAT (in the US,  you bet, if the US dares to separate &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; category in order to see), GCSE, A-level (in the UK), and the corresponding ones in all major European countries apart from IQ test.   Nuff said.  I feel a bit embarrassed to even compare the two.<br>

As for East Asians being nationalists staying in their own countries? Really? Read the stats, the highest immigration from Asia into the United States is NOT from India but from China. So much for being nationalist. In short, I believe the Indians and Chinese are equally responsible for needlessly coming into our countries and stealing our jobs and resources, SBA loans,etc.<br>
And since when did anyone hear about a genius Nigerian. I&rsquo;ve heard about notable Indians, Chinese, Japanese etc innovators/pioneers but never a Nigerian. There you have it, yet another moot point.</p>
<p>&#8220;So does it really surprise anyone, for example in the US, that Indians&rsquo; average income and public image as you cited are good /better is due to the fact that they, or you if you are Indian, are OVER- propositionally represented by overwhelming amount of Indian H1B (or whatever name that is) visa holders (good IQ and &gt; medium income by default of such visa to start with), vís-a-vís NE Asians and the indigenous whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>Well again, the same applies for just about any East Asian group. however, even in the high IQ category, the Indians outscore all other Asians to flank the #1 position. Why? Or do I smell envy? The fact is either ways, the white majority - who truly built up this country is in peril from ANY non white group - be it Indians, East Asians, Moslems or any other non European people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, Upper Caste Indians ARE well represented in the &ldquo;high flyer categories&rdquo;. Compared to previous years, despite its many mitigating problems India seems to be progressing well on the positive side of the Bell Curve. Ask yourself why? Thus your point is moot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately NO.  You are making 5 false claims here in one breath: stunning!</p>
<p>One, Indians,  in general,  are NOT well represented in the &ldquo;high flyer categories&rdquo; – it&rsquo;s the crème of the Indian UPPER class who did so, to a certain degree, compared to the AVERAGE local population.</p>
<p>Two, blurring high flyer categories.  What are they? Comedians, talkshow hosts, liberal community organisers, etc, etc are &ldquo;high flyer categories&rdquo; in your book? Surely they are more exposed to the public eyes with higher income, yet those don&rsquo;t require much of IQ.</p>
<p>Three, even their appearances in traditional g-loaded high flyer categories, such as engineering, technologies, sciences, etc, are subject to a certain degree to AA, and with its associated unusually large amount of corruptions using Tribal Network – think Indians &rsquo; Silicon Valley in CA.   (A company CEO, a politician, or a social science professor in a regular university that you sometimes find these upper class Indians are,  by and large, NOT belong to the highest IQers, but certainly a good PR man possessing higher than average boasting skills. </p>
<p>Four, it requires tens of thousands of  years for human races&rsquo; bell curve to &ldquo;progress &rdquo;just a tiny bit, &ldquo;while Indians upper class &ldquo;did it&rdquo; ( assuming they &ldquo;did it&rdquo; here)  in a decade in the US and Canada&rdquo;.   It that what you claiming?  </p>
<p>Five, &ldquo;my point is moot&rdquo;?  Perhaps only in your mind? </p>
<p></p>
<p>  &mdash;  &ldquo;Ironically, selective immigration is used not just for Indians but also for Chinese, Koreans, Japanese etc. Thus your warped logic would have to include east Asians too! Yet another moot point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrong. Everything is not absolute but relative. US immigration policy is by default to attract higher than average IQers from EVERY nations which of course include Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, alongside British, Germans, etc.    Point is the sheer number of India&rsquo;s population, and the sheer scale of India&rsquo;s #1 national strategic export   &mdash;   the Indian upper class people to the West   &mdash;   over the decades that have made it RELATIVELY much more a case in hand here.</p>
<p>On average, Most NE Asian intellectual elites are INSIDE our own countries, not in the West, not now, not in the future. The same can not be said to Indians.</p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;As for East Asians being nationalists staying in their own countries? Really? Read the stats, the highest immigration from Asia into the United States is NOT from India but from China. So much for being nationalist. In short, I believe the Indians and Chinese are equally responsible for needlessly coming into our countries and stealing our jobs and resources, SBA loans,etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrong again.  Currently the number of mainland Chinese nationals STUDYING ( not permanent immigration that you try to disguise here !) in the west might exceed total Indian students, for 1 year or maybe 2 years now?, yet the accumulative numbers that STAYED in the West are totally different, especially when taken the last 2 decades into account.</p>
<p>Their nature of going abroad and long-term planning are totally different:  majority of NE Asians go home after the study; for those who stayed their long term goal is to gain more experiences then returning to contribute to our own countries with no intention to permanently stay in the West – the stats say so and the trend is increasing clear.  </p>
<p>Yet the same can not be said on majority of Indians – India to them, by and large, is a no-go zone they feel lucky to escape from.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
&rdquo;And since when did anyone hear about a genius Nigerian. I&rsquo;ve heard about notable Indians, Chinese, Japanese etc innovators/pioneers but never a Nigerian. There you have it, yet another moot point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agreed that it&rsquo;s not to compare a famous Nigerian to a famous Indian in the West – no surprise, as India has 1.3 billion people and how many Nigerians in Nigeria.  The more fair comparison would be Africa as a whole ( about 1 billion Africans?) compared to India as a whole.  Then you&rsquo;ll start to see,  in North America for instance, that for every famous Indian in such such &ldquo;high flyer careers&rdquo;, one could perhaps name a equally famous black African ( including US black population) if one takes a closer look. </p>
<p>Indians then perhaps still have an upper hand compared to Africans in g-loaded careers in the US, even though not too much now, due to a)  the fact that India average IQ (81) is about 10-15 points higher than that of sub-Sahara Africa surely guarantees more natural talents,  b) recent African immigrants ( and historical Blacks in the US) by and large are not subject to Selective Immigration policy  unlike Indians in the US/Canada. This will further artificially pop up Indian&rsquo;s image vís-a-vís Africans in public eyes. </p>
<p>All in all, usual Joes just don&rsquo;t think deep and could be easily brainwashed by the media into the thinking that Indians are so much different.  In reality as roughly discussed above, they are not so much better than even American blacks, on average, if the liberal media is &ldquo;kindly&rdquo; enough to include in their income average and &ldquo;high flyer careers&rdquo; propaganda  those large number of illegal Indians earning perhaps 10 bucks per day in motels, car wash and highway 7/11s allover the US.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;Well again, the same applies for just about any East Asian group. however, even in the high IQ category, the Indians outscore all other Asians to flank the #1 position. Why? Or do I smell envy? &rdquo;</p>
<p>Envy? You gotta be kidding me?  NE Asians envy about India/Indians who rank at bottom in HDI, income, prosperity, IQ, or just almost anything, in the world?  Actually any country  with majority or large minority Indians are ranked close to the bottom of the world, being Fiji, Mauritius, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan&hellip;  Telling true and my sympathy, perhaps;  but &ldquo;envy&rdquo;? Please.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;Well again, the same applies for just about any East Asian group. however, even in the high IQ category&rdquo;, it is just another counter-intuition and counter-science claim of yours – thus false as well,  based on &hellip;errrr&hellip;.nothing!  I don&rsquo;t want to get into the detail of debugging it since it belongs to another epic topic I assure you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo; The fact is either ways, the white majority - who truly built up this country is in peril from ANY non white group - be it Indians, East Asians, Moslems or any other non European people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Agreed, finally, in principle.   </p>
<p>Yet the reason WHY even &ldquo;Indian&rsquo;s achievements&rdquo; started to oddly appear in this thread is that it&rsquo;s directly linked by the &ldquo;logic&rdquo; that {&ldquo;Singapore is successful largely due to high IQ Indians there&rdquo;,  hence the unspoken being the West should get more Indian diversity to be successful} . </p>
<p>As I debugged above, it is a false claim, or a lie actually.   And NE Asians by and large are totally different from Indians in most sense. Actually the biological differences between the two almost put them at two extreme ends of a spectrum where.   Comparing the two is akin to compare the whites and blacks.</p>
<p> <br>
Therefore to sum it up, Singapore&rsquo;s success is NOT because of its diversity, but precisely on the contrary, it&rsquo;s successful and continuous top-down effects made by Singapore ethnic Chinese government to combat and limit the historical diversity that have made Singapore strong!</p>

<p>1.Indians cannot avail AA. Like other Asian Americans and whites they can only enter schools or trades of profession through merit. So your point is moot!</p>
<p>2. I believe it is well established that Indians DO gain high flyer positions even more than any other Asian community - CEO&rsquo;s, Founders of companies, Deans of reputed schools, inventors, researchers, President of research labs etc.</p>
<p>A joint Duke University – UC Berkeley study revealed that Indian immigrants have founded more engineering and technology companies from 1995 to 2005 than immigrants from the U.K., China, Taiwan and Japan combined. A University of California, Berkeley, study reported that one-third of the engineers in Silicon Valley are of Indian descent, while 7% of valley hi-tech firms are led by Indian CEOs. In 2002, there were over 223,000 Asian Indian-owned firms in the U.S., employing more than 610,000 workers, and generating more than $88 billion in revenue.You can only imagine what that figure must be in the year 2011..atleast triple that amount. Thus the net contributions of East Indians despite being a mere 0.47% of the total US population is atleast US$ 250 billion to the US economy. Pretty good, I must say considering the debt we are under. Face it: the Indians easily outdo the Chinese and other East Asians anywhere except maybe Australia and South East Asia. They got more billionaires, more industrialists/CEO&rsquo;s in the top 10 Forbes list, bigger companies of international repute ( TATA) and a stable banking system. something which does not exist in communist China. </p>

<p>3. Compared to India, China is ripping us hollow. Any smart conservative will always consider China and her allies as the biggest threat to the United States. And strange that China&rsquo;s friends happen to be the world&rsquo;s villains - Pakistan, Arab world, N Korea, Iran etc. Here is a well renowned conservative industrialist (1%) whose astute opinions are generally well regarded.</p>

Individual excellences, which could be found in each race and sub-race, are not representative for the average at all.  Most of your quotes from Wiki Indian supremacist pages have been deliberately massaged solely aiming at misleading. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the next you will quote btw?  &#8220;Indians invented zero&#8221; ? or popular still, the hilarious &ldquo;Indians have average IQ of 120&rdquo;  and comical &ldquo;35% of NASA scientists are Indians, so as Microsoft, Intel, Apple, etc. etc. &rdquo;?   Please, not again, not here, even though you have my deep sympathy.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that I have roughly debugged your points about India/Indians at the fundamental level with my previous posts. Your keep repeating them, in one manner or another like mainstream liberal media incessantly do, doesn&rsquo;t suddenly make them true, albeit perhaps they could convince some naïve conditioned minds.</p>
<p>Anyway, good to see an Indian supremacist taking up a &ldquo;permanent residence&rdquo; in Amren and it&rsquo;s my pleasure talking to you by debugging your misleading arguments point by point.  Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t an unlimited time for such simple exercises at weekend, so til the next time and be good.<br>

<p>You keep reiterating the same points despite me debunking all your claims. I believe my posts are more valid because unlike you I actually furnish my points with ample evidence. You are quite free to disagree and have a counterpoint but don&rsquo;t make unlettered blanket statements claiming you have even attempted to make a decent rebuttal. The fact is the Indians have certainly achieved and earned far more laurels than the other East Asians combined here in the west. Nevertheless, I don&rsquo;t want this country filled with Indians or Orientals.</p>
<p> I believe China along with N Korea, Iran, Pakistan and the Arab states as the biggest enemies of the United States. I am not so worried about the other nation states. From the internal prespective, I am highly cautious about liberals who want to make radical changes which will offset the true destiny of our American heritage : that of a traditional White Christian Nation.</p>

		<p>Some tips i have seen in terms of computer memory is that there are requirements such as SDRAM, DDR and the like, that must fit in with the features of the mother board. If the pc&rsquo;s motherboard is pretty current and there are no operating-system issues, modernizing the memory space literally requires under one hour. It&rsquo;s one of several easiest computer upgrade processes one can envision. Thanks for giving your ideas in Ignorant Viewpoints Shouldn&rsquo;t Be Ignored :: American Renaissance News.	</p>

		<p>I agree Venus de Milo:</p>
<p>Why on Earth would any white person envy an Asian. I just got sick and tired of reading this luducruous article by Amy Chua - &#8220;Why Chinese mothers are superior&#8221;. Needless to say, it was hilarious. I seriously believe the Chinese envy all Caucasian groups. Unlike the Mongoloids (Chinese, Koreans and other east Asians) - the Caucasian produces not just intellect &amp; creativity but also superior physical strength and bravery. The only East Asians I respect are the Japanese, because they have some amount of Caucasian DNA in them. The Japanese are racially related to the Finnish people and Siberians. The Chinese and others from the P`acific rim on the other hand are pure Mongoloids, who needed Caucasian ingenuity to foster their civilization. The fact they use rhetoric like this is because they secretly resent &amp; envy us. Enough said.</p>
