			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sowetan Live, October 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>ANC Youth League president Julius Malema told a community in Vereeniging, south of Johannesburg, to hold on to their land and not to fear whites.</p>
<p>Malema said white people had brought nothing with them when they came to South Africa more than three centuries ago.</p>
<p>His remarks at the weekend in Diepsloot  &mdash;  which the ANCYL is using as rallying platforms for its so-called economic freedom march to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) on Thursday  &mdash;  have stirred responses from some quarters, including the Freedom Front.</p>
<p>Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder said the youth leaders were being &#8220;reckless and irresponsible&#8221; with their provocative utterances on land and nationalisation of mines.</p>
<p>Malema told residents of Bantu Bonke township, outside Vereeniging, that the land they occupied was rich with minerals and they should refuse to give it up at all cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard Anglo wants you to move. They said there was alternative land because they had discovered a mineral,&#8221; Malema said yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must restore our dignity. We must have everything that white people have. Everything they have in town we want the same where we stay, better services.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ANC promised free water and electricity and that must still happen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He asked the residents to join the planned march to the JSE and the Union Buildings later this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must march to Pretoria and ask the leadership to return land to the people. When boers came here they never had land. They found us here and they did not bring any land or minerals. There is nobody who will liberate you unless you stand up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the government should provide people with land to farm and be their own &#8220;baas&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear of white people must come to an end,&#8221; Malema said.</p>
<p>He started his day with a visit to the Methodist Church in Ratanda.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our position on politics is that we are neutral, we do not take sides,&#8221; Pastor Andile Senandile said.</p>
<p>Senandile asked Malema not to talk about politics in church, which Malema agreed to.</p>
<p>Malema is facing charges of bringing the ANC into disrepute and sowing division within the party.</p>
<p>The march to Joburg and Pretoria is regarded as an attempt by Malema and the league to show the support they enjoy to make it impossible for the ANC to consider expelling or suspending him.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  - Lies.  Lies.  Lies.  And no one, not even white advocates, ever bring up the fact that all those african tribes in South Africa now were also immigrants (from the north) into the southern area.</p>
<p>There was no great african empire or nation occupying that land.  Not even any big towns or villages.  There were a few nomadic bands of 15-30 people in hundreds of square miles.</p>
<p>The Dutch arrived in a virtually empty land.  They did not find Zulus in Capetown or anyone else except for a few small bands of hottentots who started stealing supplies from the Dutch right away.</p>

<p>Except for civilization.</p>
<p><i>We must have everything that white people have.</i></p>
<p>Why is that so?  You don&rsquo;t deserve everything white people have, for a lot of reasons.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The ANC promised free water and electricity and that must still happen,&rdquo; he said.</i></p>
<p>Except that electricity production and water filtration and transport isn&rsquo;t free.</p>
<p><i>They found us here and they did not bring any land or minerals.</i></p>
<p>Stupid, you can&rsquo;t bring land or minerals, per se.  There were minerals in that uninhabited land all along, but left to black &#8220;ingenuity&#8221; and &#8220;work&#8221; (or rather, the lack thereof), those minerals would still be under the ground.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Fear of white people must come to an end,&rdquo; Malema said.</i></p>
<p>Code words for &#8220;genocide of white people must begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>BTW, didn&rsquo;t this creep recently get convicted of some sort of hate crime or hate rhetoric charges for the &#8220;Kill the Boer&#8221; song?  Why isn&rsquo;t he in prison?</p>

		<p>I guess it will be soon time for &#8220;Save the Children, South Africa&#8221;. There will be those awful images of children starving to death, and they will want us to donate money. If white governments were allowed to exist in Africa, the majority of blacks would have risen to a middle class living standard by now. Now all they have is a future of starvation, rape and AIDS. As the western countries continue to decline, the hand-outs will dry up as well. </p>

		<p>Make no mistake, genocide of Whites in Africa has been going on for a very long time now and is encouraged to this day. I hope the website owner will allow this link to be posted that keeps track of the crimes against Whites in S.A. It&rsquo;s important that we cast our focus on this because no one else seems to give a damn.</p>

		<p>5 Tom: If Malema becomes the next president, heaven help them. He has all the hallmarks of an Idi Amin. Stereotypical tinpot dictator, and irresponsible beyond imagination. Is it really going to take the slaughter of the remaining whites in SA to wake people up? Will that even do it?</p>
<p>Yes, he was in trouble over the singing of &#8220;Kill the Boer&#8221;, but it&rsquo;s Africa over there. Nothing will happen to him regarding that. </p>

See <a href="http://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://censorbugbear-reports.blogspot.com/.</a> From whites being raped in Norway, being shot in the Fayetteville, NC, public schools, and being butchered in South Africa the shadow of death hovers. Will whites  &mdash;  in the words of G. Gordon Liddy (about Americans) stop &#8220;believing in the Easter Bunny?&#8221;  &mdash;  and unite to save their race and their civilization?</p>

		<p>Respect is never a two way street for blacks. Blacks criticise whites if they say &#8216;resist blacks&rsquo;, or incitements to kill (which is unacceptable, IMO), but they find it OK to say &#8216;resist whites&rsquo; or incitements to kill whites. Simply sickening. South Africa is slowly on it&rsquo;s way to becoming the next Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>If all of the whites are gone in SA, who will the blacks hate and blame? Probably the coloured people. And what if they are gone? Probably blacks will spiral into a civil war, amongst many different black tribes. And they will still blame the whites (and possibly the coloured people) for their shortcomings. I have sympathy for SA whites, and perhaps some of the coloureds. But I have no sympathy for the SA blacks.</p>

<p>&#8221; &hellip;.. it will be soon time for &ldquo;Save the Children, South Africa&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There is already something called the Mandela Children&rsquo;s Fund<br/>
They have a website and you can contact them.</p>
<p>Ask them what the size of their budget is<br/>
Ask them to list their projects undertaken<br/>
Ask them to reveal their expenditure on these projects<br/>
Ask them to reveal their administrative overheads</p>
<p>Then pull out your calculator</p>

		<p>This is what Aprtheid was all about, to stop the same disasters occurring in South Africa as occurred in 95% of the other African countries once they receivd &#8220;their freedom&#8221;  The inept and greedy want to steal all that the Euiropean white Africans have built up over three hundred years of living there and why not?  It sure saves working for it, but already there have been disasters where affirmative action has been forced on companies where black africans must be employed in proportionate numbers to the various groupings of the races there,  Apartheid was where the various groups were to be given their own countries several as big as or bigger than Texas with all the benefits such as working mines, factories etc, and te white Africans were to be left in situ with a central white government to help the inevitable messes that the new countries with their own black African presidents and elected governments were bound to get into,and they have since.  Only a matter of time now when the begging bowls will be held out by South Africa as in Zimbabwae, etc.   Take a look at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spainvia.com/leftwingdisaster.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spainvia.com/leftwingdisaster.htm</a></p>
<p>It is a pity that the white Africans are not all Jewish as the USA would assist them in their perilous position now.</p>
<p>I lived in South Africa for 24 years until 1999.</p>

<p>Used to be called the &#8220;K&#8221; factor in the old Rhodesian and South African armies: black Africans had some overwhelming awe of white people. It often gave the troopies a tactical edge. </p>
<p>Interesting that Malema claims this fear still exists. If so, then perhaps SA whites might exploit it in order to survive?</p>

		<p>Watching the Malema nationalisation demo in South Africa I think the protesters display is disgusting. Dancing like a bunch of clowns acting like if they are carrying machine guns and shooting around in the surrounding crowd. Malema and his thugs are a bunch of criminals. What a historical and moral disgrace to let ANC in power destroying the great Afrikaner nation into a ruin ! </p>
<p>This is clown Malema&rsquo;s claim to rule the RSA ! </p>
<p>To impose a criminal National Democratic Revolution and to impose lanrab and nationalisation of resources &hellip; for whom ? </p>
<p>Were did Malema get his fortune ? From the Dead Kadafi&rsquo;s ? </p>
<p>It is better for the moderate colored Asian and white communities to have a Constitutional autonomous Afrikaner State within that of the current RSA so that they can protect themselves from the voodoo of the Malema gang so that the Afrikaner society can maintain their economic contribution (R1.000+ billion) to the RSA instead of having it all destroyed by Malemao !</p>
<p>It is time to put the moral pressure on the Demokratiese Aliensie van Helen Zille for she is co responsible for the murder on Afrikaner, the discriminatory BEE, the massive poverty among a million community what once was economically thriving, the plakkers kampe, the massive destruction of billions of economical capital &hellip; We must demand autonomy for Westkaap where Afrikaner can seek refuge and can no longer defend themselves in the rand. Meanwhile other successive plans can proceed as well. There is a community of 4, 5 6 million Afrikaner, a hundred and a half thousand dead and a annual economic community of R1.000 minimum at stake !</p>

		<p>You will never have what white Europeans have. Even if you take everything we own, we will still have what you can never obtain. A history, a heritage worth the mention, and the intelligence and capability to produce such a history.<br/>

		<p>Unfortunately Blacks are not only inept and have very low IQ&rsquo;s, but they also are jealous of others to an extreme. Whether it was the Jews, Koreans, Italians, Indians, White Gentiles they have all been accused of stealing from the Blacks to become prosperous. What the Blacks never explain, however is that after they drive these groups out of their areas, the Black society just collapses. If they were not so malevolent I would feel sorry for them.</p>
