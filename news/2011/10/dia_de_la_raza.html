<h1>Dia de la Raza</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>American Renaissance, October 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A reader has sent us a copy of a notice that appeared on the East Patrick St. branch of the BB&T; bank in Frederick, Maryland, announcing  that the bank will be closed for Columbus Day. In Spanish, the notice calls the holiday &#8220;Dia de la Raza&#8221; or &#8220;Day of the Race.&#8221;</p>
<p>We would like to wish all our readers a happy &#8220;Day of the Race.&#8221;</p>

<p>You know what to do, close those accounts, write a letter to that branch and cc the main corp office.  Tell them, have your fun with your PC trash, without me.</p>
<p>We did the same with that most unAmerican bank, Bank of America, or as some of you know it in the SW, Banco Amigo.  The FDIC would close BA right now if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fact the FDIC itself is broke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many countries in the New World and elsewhere celebrate the anniversary of Christopher Columbus&rsquo;s arrival in the Americas, which occurred on October 12, 1492, as an official holiday. The event is celebrated as Columbus Day in the United States, as Día de la Raza in many countries in Latin America, as Discovery Day in the Bahamas, as Día de la Hispanidad and Fiesta Nacional in Spain and as Día de las Américas (Day of the Americas) in Uruguay. These holidays have been celebrated unofficially since the late 18th century, and officially in various areas since the early 20th century.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Well considering the importance of money transfers and checking accounts from the Latino community as long as they can get more money from them than concerned white folks they are being logical.<br>
 When anyone looks at it the Latinos being more indian than white and losing most of their country due to the Mexican American war they identify more with natives than white folks.</p>

		<p>The chairman of the board of BB&T; considers himself a conservative Republican.  So much for &#8220;conservative Republicans,&#8221; huh?  Really, there&rsquo;s nothing inherent about lamestream conservative ideology any more than the hard left that is useful in resisting our racial dispossession.</p>

		<p>Yet another example of corporate fecklessness in the face of multicultural aggression.  My strategy to fight back:  Rather than launch another useless boycott, buy minimum voting shares in the company; prepare a proxy resolution at the next shareholders convention; and give a floor speech in support of the resolution.  It may not win a majority, but it will throw a good scare into management.  Believe me, top brass   &mdash;   the CEO will be there   &mdash;   will listen.  </p>

		<p>Actually BB&T; didn&rsquo;t rename Columbus Day. Columbus Day has always been called Día de La Raza in Latin America. La Raza of course being the new synergistic syncretic Mestizo Cosmic Race. </p>
<p>That said, BB&T; still deserves a run on deposits for Hispandering. BB&T; is also actively engaged in a Human Resources Dept. campaign of replacing its tellers and CSRs with bilingual tellers. Guess where the adverse disparate impact of this campaign falls.</p>

It&rsquo;s funny, Jim;<br>
I grew up in the 70s/80s, and back then, whites usually felt it was impolite to call someone a Mexican. They&rsquo;d say, &#8220;oh, the&hellip;&rsquo;SPANISH&rsquo; family down the street.&#8221;<br>
I know in some cases it was like&hellip;PuertoRican, Cuban, Mexican, whatever&hellip;Spanish!<br>
But there was also that dumb white guilt&hellip;like you can&rsquo;t call a spade a spade!<br>
It&rsquo;s bad to call someone a PuertoRican or a Mexican, because those places generally suck, because they have THOSE people there, ergo, to call that man Mexican, is to insult him. Like the very word itself&hellip;Mexican&hellip;is a slur.<br>
Well, actually, that&rsquo;s correct!<br>
Just not politically correct!</p>

<p>Interesting point.  Makes one wonder what race was originally being celebrated.  Indians didn&rsquo;t have much reason to celebrate Columbus&rsquo;s arrival although the Spanish did.  South Americans are very proud of their Spanish (White) ancestry and like their Indian ancestry to be as small as possible.  It certainly seems that &ldquo;la Raza&rdquo; whose day it is, was originally meant to be White.  I can&rsquo;t see 18th century Latin Americans (especially those setting the holidays) celebrating Mestizos or calling them THE race as modern Mexicans do, or am I wrong here?<br>

		<p>What race? Italian? Spanish? Erm&hellip; that&rsquo;s part of the Caucasian race.</p>
<p>Mexicans are mostly mongrel Spanish, Indian and black. Therefore, &#8220;Dia de mestizo&#8221; is more accurate, but signifies nothing, as though they became a mixed race on that day in history. Orwellian effacement of history to pander to those without a race who insist they are a race.</p>

		<p>Seek&rsquo;s idea is indeed a good one.  It was regarding a different matter, but years ago Charlton Heston managed to embarrass the living daylights out of the chief executives of Time-Warner.  He requested the floor, and when it was granted, proceeded in reciting the lyrics to one of the rap albums by Ice-T.</p>

		<p>This is old old news.  Columbus Day has been called Dia de la Raza since the 1920s in some countries.  This has <i>nothing</i> to do with BB&T.;  Guys, don&rsquo;t get angry at BB&T; for this, their translator was just using the standard term for it as used in Mexico.</p>

		<p>As some posters have said, it&rsquo;s best to tell these people who are pandering to nonwhites that we will stop doing business with them.  First, they&rsquo;ll chuckle and say, &#8220;God, what a bunch of crazy white supremacists&#8221;  but when more and more of us do it, they won&rsquo;t be laughing.  They&rsquo;ll say, &#8220;Oh, no.  If we keep pissing them off, we&rsquo;ll lose business.&#8221;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right, they lost it.  Mexico tried to reclaim and extend the former Spanish Empire&rsquo;s holdings in North America and fought a war with the US, and lost.  Our treaty terms were generous, considering that we captured Mexico City.</p>
<p>All over the world, modern, technical civilization spread.  It had to &#8220;conquer&#8221; or better term, civilize natives that often lived in the stone age people who had not even invented the wheel or had an alphabet.  Regardless how how colorful they are portrayed now, they were primitive, often vicious people who practiced human sacrifice and even cannibalism.  I can just imagine a situation today where the civilizations are termed &#8220;First World,&#8221; &#8220;Second World,&#8221; &#8220;Third World,&#8221; and &#8220;Fourth World.&#8221;  The Fourth World would be those huge sections of geography, including the entire New World, where we had politely left the natives to continue their ways while we advanced.  We would have advanced slower, (due to more restricted trade, for example) but we would have progressed all the same.  We would have even higher numbers of hungry masses, jealous of our success, while coveting it at the same time.  The shorter version is that how things are really is human destiny.  I just hope the implosion going on now, is not also destiny, because without whites the world will certainly collapse into chaos.  Our fewer numbers is why it is doing so poorly now.</p>
<p>It would do those &#8220;Litinos&#8221; some good to actually learn history and use what mental capacity they DO have to fathom how things would be without whites or historical European intervention.</p>

		<p>Bank of America is the one that Jay Leno is taking shots at for instituting a $5.00 Debit card swipe fee. </p>
<p>This was the Bank that offered Illegal Aliens the chance to open Bank accounts to place their untaxed monies into a safe place, until transfered home. What a nice arrangement that is. </p>
<p>Bank of America seems to be able to come up with one way after another to screw the American people, while bending over backwards for Illegal Aliens. </p>

Reminds me of the time I had to &#8220;blockade&#8221; a national chain restraunt because my renter who worked there  moved out taking thousands of dollars of my shelves and drawers with him. Guess he was too lazy to just pour the spoons into a box&hellip; Anyway I paced up and down on public property two feet from their patio dining. The first day the employees laughed and cat called me like some kind of irate psyco. The second day they whispered and pointed. The third day they had me come in and give the assembled management team my grieveances. They said it was not their problem. I said I knew that but I was determined to stay there until I spotted my ex-renter. The fourth day they walked him out to me and told him I needed to get my custom drawers back if he still wanted a job there. I found them all in my front yard about two hours later. The real hero was my boss who gave me up to five days off for the &#8220;stakeout&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>No they do not grasp it because it is patently false.Depending on the country the % is different. However in the USA 5% of so-called Hispanics are White. This has been pointed out over and over on this site. I believe it is the same White wannabe who keeps printing this nonsense.</p>
