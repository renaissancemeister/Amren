			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nile Gardiner, Telegraph (London), October 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Although ignored by most of America&rsquo;s liberal-dominated media, several online US news sites are reporting that Michelle Obama&rsquo;s grand tour of southern Africa earlier this year cost American taxpayers nearly half a million dollars  &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s just for the flights. This follows in the wake ofclaims this August from sources inside the White House itself that the First Lady may have spent &#8220;$10 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on vacations alone in the past year.&#8221; Without all the figures available, it is impossible to establish the total cost to the public purse of Michelle Obama&rsquo;s 42 days of holiday during that period, which included her trip to Spain last year (though not the Obamas&rsquo; recent sojourn in Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard).</p>
<p>But we do now know for sure that her visit to Africa in June, with a sizeable entourage in tow, cost taxpayers at the very minimum $424,142 in transportation costs, according to figures obtained by Washington-based watchdog Judicial Watch. As the &#8216;Washington Whispers&rsquo; blog at US News and World Report noted:</p>
<blockquote>First lady Michelle Obama&rsquo;s family trip to South Africa and Botswana in June cost taxpayers well over $424,000, according to new accounting based on Air Force manifests obtained by Judicial Watch, a taxpayer watchdog group.
<p>The use of Air Force aircraft alone for the June 21-27 trip cost $424,142, said the group, and that doesn&rsquo;t include the food, lodging, and ground transportation for the 21 family and staff members.</blockquote></p>
<p>The First Lady&rsquo;s supporters will argue that her African tour advanced relations between the United States and South Africa and Botswana, even though it also included an safari in Kruger National Park near Johannesburg. I suspect most Americans, however, will view this trip as a waste of public funds at a time when the US is running a massive budget deficit and faces a national debt of more than $14 trillion. In an age of austerity, even the First Lady should be expected to make sacrifices, not least when she is spending other people&rsquo;s money. It is a matter of public interest how public figures spend taxpayer funds, and Mrs Obama should be held to account. As Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton notes:</p>
<blockquote>This trip was as much an opportunity for the Obama family to go on a safari as it was a trip to conduct government business. This junket wasted tax dollars and the resources of our overextended military. No wonder we had to sue to pry loose this information.</blockquote>
<p>There can be no doubt that this latest revelation about Michelle Obama&rsquo;s spending is an embarrassment to the White House at a time when the president is talking about spending cuts, and at least trying to give the impression that he is reining in the deficit. It is also a symbol of the gulf between the taxpayer-subsidised, privileged lifestyle of America&rsquo;s ruling elites in Washington, compared to the tens of millions of hard-working Americans who are struggling to pay the mortgage, hold on to their homes, put food on the table for their families, and simply make ends meet.</p>
<p>80 per cent of US voters still think the country is in a recession, according to Gallup, and the First Lady&rsquo;s lavish spending will surely go down badly in a nation that has taken a real hit economically under President Obama&rsquo;s failed policies. It is hard to think of a presidency more out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans than the current one, and Mrs Obama&rsquo;s actions will only serve to reinforce that impression. Could Michelle Obama prove a liability for the president as he seeks re-election in 2012? Based on this evidence, the answer is definitely yes.</p>

		<p>Blacks like this Michelle thinks the whites in this country own it to her because she is black.  It is hard to get away from that mentality when it is an integral part of the black community she grew up in.  And this welfare mentality is reinforced by the whites themselves by generational welfare, affirmative action, etc.  Blacks actually regressed under this welfare mentality due to the very generous white handouts.</p>

<p>The answer is definitely &#8220;No.&#8221; Being black is like having automatic tenure. Being black and being a woman is like having diplomatic immunity. Michelle Obama could be caught on camera smoking crack in a hotel room with Kwayme Kilpatrick and Marion Berry and still emerge slicker than teflon.</p>

		<p>The spectacle of closing off the beach in Spain was one thing. Breaking custom and protocol by touching the Queen of England was another. &#8216;Finally&rsquo; proud to be an American etc etc. One look at this woman and you can feel the disdain and hatred that she has for the white race - you can just see it.</p>
<p>I have heard there was friction between her and Rahm Emmanuel due to some very bizarre behavior she exhibited around the White House.</p>

		<p>In the early pre-election days of 2008, Michelle was in an interview, with who I cannot recall. She was talking about how there should be a redistribution of wealth in America. Now, even if I was planning to vote for Obama, which I wasn&rsquo;t, there was a smirk on her face that I&rsquo;m sure she was not even aware of, which would have stopped me. You had to read between the lines, but her speach essentially boiled down to a socialist, marxist itinerary which she thought she was disguising well. But the mean spirited, nasty smirk on her face gave it away. It made my skin crawl and made me sick to think that if Obama won the election, them and their ilk were going to do their best to dismantle this country, starting with the middle class. I&rsquo;ve never been so sorry to be right. Now look at our country. This woman is racist to the core. And ignorant. Just what section of this country did she think made it strong, and at one time, wealthy? So her spending habits come as no surprise. She&rsquo;s just sticking it to whitey.</p>

<p>Expect a week of hot air from controlled media orifices and the usual pandering to the cameras by our champions in DC about their &#8220;outrage&#8221; over this Louis XIV living in the White House. We may even be treated to the spectacle of a &#8220;hard-hitting new law&#8221; putting &#8220;strict limits&#8221; on junket expenses. A new law always fixes the problem.</p>

		<p>The trip, by itself, is not so out of the ordinary as far as First Lady behvior goes.  But there are a couple of factors which give me pause.</p>
<p>I understand that the information had to be supboenaed under the Freedom of Information Act because the White House refused to release it to the public.  That&rsquo;s concern one.  Where&rsquo;s that promise of transparency?</p>
<p>And by what stretch of the imagination do Michelle&rsquo;s young daughters count as Senior Staff rather than family members?  And what does that mean in terms of other hidden expenditures?</p>
<p>Still small potatoes? In the larger picture could there be others in the White House disguising self-interest as public service?</p>
<p>When people are secretive and dishonest in smaller issues in their lives can they be expected to be honest in larger ones?</p>

We know both Michelle and her husband are as anti-White as they come, so what is with the big surprise?

<p>I am race realist and a WN. However the above statement in not always true. I have known some decent Blacks. Believe me when I put myself in their shoes life was not a cakewalk. I am a realist not a wild hater. Many Whites and others hate Blacks on sight. Try living with that your whole life. That is why segregation was good for all of us. Blacks did not introduce the above programs, remember that. Apartness for all races. That is what killed S.A. They wanted the cheap labor. Pure and total segregation is the only answer.</p>

		<p>This sudden interest in the supposed wrong doing of the first lady is a clever ploy to direct outrage about Obama&rsquo;s destruction of the economy and White fear of flash mobs and black on White crime to first lady nonsense.</p>
<p>Presidents have used this ploy for centuries.  FDR&rsquo;s wife was his emissary to the CPUSA and the blacks. Mrs Roosevelt got all the blame for FDR&rsquo;s hiring thousands of communists in the federal goverment.  The pitch was that the wife may be a radical, but the president was just a mild social welfare net<br>
advocate. Only the FBI realized that FDR, not his wife put thousands of communists in federal agencies.</p>
<p>Jackie Kennedy stayed in the background until her wimp of a husband let the russians build the berlin wall and station missiles in Cuba. Then all we heard about the presidency was the wife&rsquo;s clothes and how cute the kids were.</p>
<p>LBJ&rsquo;s wife started the environmental movement when LBJ&rsquo;s vietnam war was on its last legs.Then  the radicals who convinced him to force through the 1965 civil rights for all but Whites act and establish the EEOC went on to foment revolution in America.</p>
<p>When Reagan came in and stopped Carter&rsquo;s 4 years of double digit inflation in a month and turned Carter&rsquo;s high employment economy to a full employment economy the left went after Mrs. Reagan for her clothes and new dishes. No praise for Reagan turning the economy around, just criticism of Mrs. Reagan.</p>
<p>Look at history.  When a president is doing well the first lady does her first lady thing.  When a president is in trouble the wife is featured to distract from the president&rsquo;s failures.</p>
<p>He is far, far worse than Carter on the economy.  The economy is the most important thing.  Many of those White young adults who voted from him are now unemployed.</p>
<p>We wil see more and more about the wife and less and less about the downward spiral of the economy as the MSM positions their beloved Obama for his second term.</p>

		<p>Allen Eyes Obama For Movie Role</p>
<p>imdb.com ^ | Oct. 6, 2011</p>
<p>Woody Allen has confessed he&rsquo;d love to cast America&rsquo;s First Lady Michelle Obama in his next movie - if he can write the perfect role for her. The Annie Hall director&rsquo;s new film, Midnight in Paris, features a performance by Carla Bruni, the wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Allen decided on a whim to cast the politician&rsquo;s wife as he shared a meal with the couple - and he&rsquo;s adamant he&rsquo;d make U.S. President Barack Obama&rsquo;s wife a similar offer.</p>
<p>Right in time for the election.</p>

<p>I am race realist and a WN. However the above statement in not always true. I have known some decent Blacks. Believe me when I put myself in their shoes life was not a cakewalk. I am a realist not a wild hater. Many Whites and others hate Blacks on sight. Try living with that your whole life. That is why segregation was good for all of us. Blacks did not introduce the above programs, remember that. Apartness for all races. That is what killed S.A. They wanted the cheap labor. Pure and total segregation is the only answer.<br>

<p>You are a WN and a race realist? Try walking in a White man&rsquo;s shoes today or a White kid&rsquo;s shoes&hellip;.what you call &#8220;our hate&#8221; sounds like a troll to me. We call it like we see it. I could care less if there are SOME &#8220;decent black folk. They in no way make up for the evil their race has done to us and our country and nary a word or protest from their (the decent ones) own mouths either.</p>

		<p>Is anyone really surprised? I predicted this sort of thing before Obamanation even entered the Black House.</p>
<p>Just look at the manner in which every single black leader has ever ruled in Africa. They do the same thing.</p>
<p>Their race simply cannot help it. They are inferior and borderline retards.</p>

Re 29<br>
President Obama himself might have a future in Hollywood as an<br>
actor  &mdash;  what a unique launch!!  Many immigrants being inaugurated to the US, surely wonder why &#8220;Tinsel Town&#8221; is applied to Hollywood rather than to the District of Corruption.  Globalization.  </p>

		<p>Anon. #26: A few decent blacks doesn&rsquo;t make a Race. I worked in a major City, all over that City, with every group of people you can imagine. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t hate them on sight, because they&rsquo;re black. I hate their filthy habits, and constant whining. The way they slack off and refuse to work, but somehow the White people are expected to pick and do what they didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think so. They wanted the job, so do it.</p>
<p>Sure, I worked with a few that acted like human beings, but overall, I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything past them, nor would I want to be in certain Neighborhoods after dark. But, you can.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s being a Race realist, like it, or not. </p>

		<p>Anonymous 2:04 said &#8220;He is far, far worse than Carter on the economy.&#8221; At least Jimmy Carter had the good sense to wear a sweater in the White House and walk to his inauguration to at least give the appearance that he was in this with us too. Mr. O doesn&rsquo;t even try to appear like he cares.</p>

		<p>OMG! After reading this racism truly lives on. How in the world can any taxpayer including me have something to say about a half million $ trip when all the past first lady&rsquo;s spend that on decorating and clothes alone. Anyhow. Black or white the government itself is a bunch of thieves. Who built the government? White Men. </p>
