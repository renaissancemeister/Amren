			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Kirkup, Telegraph (London), October 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Home Secretary will tell the Conservative Party conference that she will stop foreign offenders using the &#8220;right to a family life&#8221; to remain in Britain.</p>
<p>Her speech comes as a Liberal Democrat security expert backs Conservative criticisms over the Human Rights Act, saying it is preventing the deportation of extremists who could mount attacks during next year&rsquo;s Olympic Games.</p>
<p>The Act, which incorporates into British law the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), is one of the flashpoints of the Coalition Government.</p>
<p>Critics, including Conservative ministers, say it is widely misused to help criminals and others escape justice, while Lib Dems insist it is misunderstood and should stay in place.</p>
<p>Article Eight of the convention, which ensures the right to a family life, has been cited by some foreign criminals fighting expulsion from Britain.</p>
<p>Scores have avoided deportation by claiming that because they have partners or children in the UK, being thrown out of the country would infringe their rights under Article Eight.</p>
<p>David Cameron, the Prime Minister, said on Tuesday, that the courts gave too much weight to the Article.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem here is that there are foreign criminals in Britain, people sometimes actually who still threaten our country or could threaten our country,&#8221; he told BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are unable to deport them because they appeal to the courts under Article Eight of this charter, which is the right to a family life.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the courts are currently giving too much attention to that rather than the protection of the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;You are able to change the immigration rules and ask them to look more carefully about the danger these individuals pose.</p>
<p>&#8220;The right to a family life is not an inalienable right in the European convention so I believe this change will work. It is not the whole solution to the problem but it is a good start.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year there were 102 successful appeals against deportation on human rights grounds which cited Article Eight.</p>
<p>Mrs May will announce today that immigration rules will be rewritten to set out explicit exemptions which would allow deportation regardless of family.</p>
<p>The new rules will direct the courts to give greater weight to sections of the ECHR which allow exceptions to be made.</p>
<p>Clause Two of the article permits exceptions that are &#8220;necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mrs May will say that the courts should consider that a range of factors outweigh a foreigner&rsquo;s right to a family life.</p>
<p>Such factors will include criminal offences, breaches of immigration rules and relying on welfare benefits for income and housing.</p>
<p>Lord Carlile, a senior Lib Dem lawyer, today backs Conservative attacks on the controversial act, warning that it could allow some known extremists to remain in the UK.</p>
<p>In an article for the Policy Exchange think tank, Lord Carlile, a former government reviewer of terrorism laws, warns that the &#8220;promiscuous use&#8221; of Article Eight could put Britain&rsquo;s security at risk by preventing the deportation of foreign terrorists now in jail.</p>
<p>He says there are more than 100 extremist offenders in custody, some of whom are to be released soon.</p>
<p>If allowed to stay in the country, he suggests, they could attack the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not scaremongering. It is a realistic assessment of what we may face,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He also calls for changes to restrict the use of Article Three of the ECHR, which prohibits torture. Terrorists such as Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali, jailed for helping in the 21/7 attacks in London, have used Article Three to remain in the UK.</p>
