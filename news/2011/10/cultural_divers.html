			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicole Santa Cruz, Los Angeles Times, October 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At a Santa Ana City Council meeting in August, Mayor Pro Tem Claudia Alvarez compared a Jewish business developer to Adolf Hitler and talked of ethnic cleansing in the downtown area, where some Latino retailers feel they have been marginalized.</p>
<p>The reaction was swift. The Anti-Defamation League called for her resignation. The City Council censured her and sought ways to defuse the racial and religious tensions Alvarez&rsquo;s remark revealed. By the next day, she had apologized, but the fury did not subside.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it was Alvarez who was helping lead a forum on cultural diversity to examine issues of hate that have cropped up not just in Santa Ana but throughout Orange County.</p>
<p>The invitation-only event quickly underscored the anger and frustration still being felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is this going to help anything?&#8221; one woman asked.</p>
<p>Said another: &#8220;Our civil rights are being violated, and it is kind of a secret thing to get rid of the Mexican community in downtown Santa Ana.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The battle by Latino business owners against a special property tax, which is what led to Alvarez&rsquo;s Hitler comment, looms large in Santa Ana, where 78% of the 324,000 residents are Latino. Some contend that the tax money benefits businesses that don&rsquo;t cater to families or the Latino clientele.</p>
<p>Alvarez&rsquo;s remark, however, is not an aberration in the county of 3 million, according to Kevin O&rsquo;Grady, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of Orange County and Greater Long Beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re here talking about Latino and Jewish relations, but there&rsquo;s a lot of discrimination and bigotry in Orange County,&#8221; O&rsquo;Grady told participants at the forum, which was streamed live.</p>
<p>He outlined instances of bullying, including one in which sixth- and seventh-grade boys were beaten in north Orange County because they were Jewish. He also said Temple Beth David in Westminster is one of the most targeted temples in the country in terms of swastika graffiti.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been some very troubling and racist statements,&#8221; O&rsquo;Grady said in an interview before the forum, adding that his organization looks at the rhetoric elected officials use and the level of civility in political dialogue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the county has also undergone drastic demographic changes in recent decades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orange County, if you go back 30 years, it was quite homogeneous,&#8221; said Rabbi Marc Dworkin, president of the local chapter of the American Jewish Committee. &#8220;Now it&rsquo;s one of the most diverse communities in the nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now hollllddd on here.  If a majority white resident/business-owned area made this argument, they would be lambasted and labeled as racist bigots.  Most areas that are of a white majority are much more heavily taxed than others and those same taxpayers do not reap the benefits for themselves.  Guess who gets the benefits?  Hmm?</p>

<p><br>
The article then goes on to say that Santa Ana is 78% Latino. If the Jews or any other group are plotting to &#8220;get rid of the Mexican community&#8221; in Santa Ana, clearly they&rsquo;re not being very effective with their eradication campaign.</p>
<p>Plus of course the inevitable Hitler comparison. Charming. </p>
<p>Beware the Santa Ana winds? We should more beware the Santa Ana windbags (left-wing latino division).</p>

I&rsquo;ve lived in Orange County my entire life. Santa Ana is a sanctuary city, full of La Raza racists and illegal invaders from Mexico. Why is anyone surprised they hate white Jews? They hate anyone who is not Hispanic and from Mexico. Of course, Alavarez will be given a free pass to spread her hate of whites as she chooses, with no adverse action taken against her. She&rsquo;s a Mexican, free to say whatever she wants, including her hate for white Americans. </p>
<p>The illegal invading Mexicans need to be purged from Santa Ana, including Alavarez. </p>

<p>Ummm I have a feeling that thirty years ago there was probably a lot less anti Jewish feeling than there is now. That is quite the irony. When it was an all White working area Santa Ana was less Anti Semitic than now. Hopefully some Jews will learn the obvious lesson. It has been shown that Anti Semitic views are 5 times as likely in Hispanic immigrants as Whites. Why there are many Jews have been encouraging non White immigration is beyond me.</p>

<p>OH, and now it is just so much better that it is so diverse. More diverse the better? Well, we know the answer. We can see it right in Santa Ana. Just let everyone be so happy.</p>

		<p>This story is ironic.  Many Jews, like Ron Unz who is publisher of The American Conservative, wanted Mexicans to pour in to California.  Now it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working out so well.</p>
<p>Also, notice how O&rsquo;grady(?) of the ADL claims that Jewish students have been beaten.  Were these students attacked because they were Jewish or because they were white?</p>
<p>When non-Jewish white students are attacked by blacks and Latinos in schools around the country during informal kill whitey days, is Mr. O&rsquo;grady outraged?</p>
<p>When Ms. Alvarez compares a Jewish businessman to Hitler, the whole affair becomes ridiculous.  It would have been more logical and more insulting for her to have said that Hitler was right about Jews.  Of course the Jewish businessman could have responded that Hitler would never have allowed his country to be overrun by Mexicans. That would have been a Mexican standoff.</p>

		<p>The fact that they wrung their hands over whether to run this benign ad says a lot. First, they must ask themselves why Amren not only exists, but is supported. That initial gut reaction they had to not run the ad is typical (in certain circles of effectively conditioned individuals). Most people from spheres like theirs wouldn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d object to it and not run the ad which effectively stifles any discussion or debate. This is a common response (again, in certain circles, particularly that of academia) and is precisely one of the reasons why Amren exists. Our viewpoints are not included in what people like to call &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, which is a context dependent term.</p>
<p>What kind of diversity are we talking about? It probably refers to racial diversity, and I&rsquo;ll get to that, but it also refers to diversity of thought, which is by and large not what people mean when they speak of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo;, they simply mean racial diversity. Yet, why I&rsquo;m here and support Amren is that I value diversity of thought. I personally object to censorship and the stifling of opposing viewpoints which is how I first came to look into Amren to see what they were about. I didn&rsquo;t let media outlets which appeared to be merely recycling SPLC propaganda scare me off, scare me into not investigating alternative viewpoints. If it isn&rsquo;t fear then what is it in their case? What explains their ignorance of Amren? Is it that the media have given them an excuse to be intellectually lazy, an excuse to bask in their own unchallenged intellectual supremacy? Who are the supremacists in this scenario?</p>
<p>If Amren is supremacist, then every ethnocentric minority group, special interest or advocacy group in this entire country is racist and or supremacist as well. Is the NAACP supremacist? Is NCLR supremacist? Is the Asian Pacific Congressional Caucus supremacist? Is the Arab American Institute supremacist? Is the Black Congressional Caucus supremacist? The list goes on and<br>
on&hellip;there are hundreds, possibly thousands of these types of organizations and not a single, officially recognized and accepted interest/advocacy group for whites. ZERO. Let me say that again&hellip;ZERO.</p>
<p>Would they please explain to us why they think that is and if they don&rsquo;t think pervasive anti-white racism is the cause please indicate why they don&rsquo;t believe this is the case.</p>
<p>The only difference between Amren and these other &lsquo;acceptable&rsquo; ethnocentric interest/advocacy groups is that most of us are white and Amren publishes stories and opinions from a white perspective and that are of interest to whites. That is<br>
the ONLY difference - that we are by and large white. These others groups are pursuing their enthnocentric interests (free from accusations of racism and supremacist, a lot of them get funding and recognition from the government!) and so are we (without taxpayer funding mind you!). Please explain to me how this amounts to racism on our part or again could even remotely qualify as supramecy.</p>
<p>In the context of myself, as a white person, how do I personally benefit from diversity? It seems to me the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; of American-style diversity is that I don&rsquo;t get a say. I get to be discriminated against by Affirmative Action policies and yet, although the government classifies me as a &ldquo;Caucasian&rdquo; for purposes of discriminating against me, I&rsquo;m not allowed to have a Caucasian interest/advocacy group of my own that advocates for me!? That says &ldquo;Hey, U.S. government, why are we still pretending that Affirmative Action isn&rsquo;t institutionalized racism? Why is racial discrimination still acceptable in this country as long as it&rsquo;s only directed at whites?&rdquo; I have no one in government that will represent me in this concern. Is diversity a strength&hellip;for me? I&rsquo;d ask the paper to come up with one single example of how diversity directly, personally benefits me as a white individual.</p>
<p>Interestingly, as the paper has also demonstrated, our critics do not actually know what we talk about here, refuse to allow us to debate them openly (typically), and smear us as supremacists because they googled &ldquo;Amren&rdquo; and noticed the SPLC says it is white supremacist so they mindlessly, uncritically accept this smear as god&rsquo;s truth, and cannot provide actual demonstrative evidence of supremacism (because you&rsquo;d have to actually read Amren to do that) to back up their smears.</p>
<p>Please, by all means they should scour this site for the &ldquo;supremacy&rdquo; they think exists here. Show me where I&rsquo;m wrong! I can tell them that only people I personally dislike are journalists that keep repeating the same ignorant lies about us over and over! Whatever happened to fact checking in journalism? Who knows. Apparently for them, that process stops at the SPLC&rsquo;s website which is curious because when you&rsquo;re reporting on something, shouldn&rsquo;t you have direct knowledge of it? Here&rsquo;s a tip: The SPLC was never appointed the official moral compass of America. They may think it has the last and final say, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it true.</p>
<p>Also when they refer to &ldquo;ignorant viewpoints&rdquo;, as they did in the title of their article, are they referring to us? Because ignorance is defined as a state of being uninformed. I have to wonder if I seem uninformed to them? We&rsquo;re well aware over here, it&rsquo;s their paper that has demonstrated ignorance of us and what Amren is really about. That&rsquo;s the only ignorance that exists here.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so incredibly arrogant, considering their complete ignorance, that they would call Amren &ldquo;supremacist&rdquo; before bothering to ask &ldquo;Hey, what are you guys actually about?&rdquo; Give Jared an interview! Are you journalists or a paper posing as a smear campaign? Prove you&rsquo;re not just the latter. I invite them to ask us to share our views and debate them as often as they&rsquo;d like. I&rsquo;d like nothing more than that.</p>

		<p>I think this is about the enormous amount of money the businesses will have to pour into an Improvement District.</p>
<p>This is the latest thing around the country.  An area of the city is designated an Improvement District.  Sometimes they go by another name.  The businesses located in the area must join.</p>
<p>It is like owning a condo, they have to pay huge taxes and other fees if they are part of the Improvement District.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t want to pay the money, they have to break their lease, get sued by the landlord for lost rent and start all over again somewhere else.  If they are making a reasonable profit from their existing business, why pay all that money for the city council&rsquo;s vision of an Improvement District?</p>
<p>The money goes for prettying up the streets with brick sidewalks, trees, flowers, taking down signs, security guards etc.  The business owners and landlords are compelled to remodel the frontage to conform with mandated designs.</p>
<p>The idea is that after several years of disruption for the remodeling and millions of dollars spent hordes of customers will come and every business will profit.</p>
<p>It often takes years to make up for the money lost during the disruption.  A real problem is the police, traffic and parking tickets.</p>
<p>California cities are so desperate for money to support all the immigrants on welfare and in schools, hospitals and jails that tickets are $70 to $300 in many cities.  The city police are directed to spend their time giving tickets for &#8220;looking like the driver is thinking of making an unsafe lane change.&#8221;  </p>
<p>In Los Angeles officers can and do give tickets to people wearing seat belts who are in fact wearing their seatbelts because the &#8220;officer could not clearly see the driver was wearing the seatbelt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and Culver City all have very successful Improvement Districts.  That is because the Chambers of Commerce and businesses made it very clear to city hall that the police departments were absolutely not to use their customers as a bank account. Contacts to that effect were signed.</p>
<p>The nearby Westwood Improvement District totally failed because it is in Los Angeles and the Los Angeles police give out hundreds of tickets a day to people driving and even walking in Westwood.  No matter how rich you are, you hate to get a $120 ticket for no reason at all when you go out to dinner. </p>
<p>If you work int he area you are not going to go out to lunch, or do errands when the police give out $70.00 jaywalking tickets if both feet are not on the curb. Westwood is emptier than when the improvements started. The businesses pay the enormous fees and taxes for a beautiful but empty district.</p>
<p>So in addition to huge fees and taxes, the customers in downtown Santa Anna will run a gauntlet of police whose main job is to give out tickets.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of reasons to reject the Improvement District.  Some work out. Others fail.  Businesses that serve low income customers can thrive but they don&rsquo;t need planters, brick sidewalks and pretty signs and frontage.</p>
<p>Certain people have accused every White advocate of being neo nazi Hitlers for 70 years.  It has become an all purpose epithet for anyone with whom you disagree.  They shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that some of the mud sticks to all Whites.</p>

<p>This country is becoming a huge zoo with the tigers squabbling with the hippos, etc., which is an unhealthy habitat for WHITES!</p>
<p>Every white country is being flooded with non-whites, in the name of &#8220;diversity&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody is saying that Africa needs diversity.</p>
<p>Nobody is saying that Asia needs diversity. </p>
<p>They are already 100% diverse. </p>
<p>People are only telling whites in white countries that they need diversity. </p>
<p>White Countries will be 100% diverse when there are no white people left.</p>
<p>Diversity is a code-word for white genocide.</p>

		<p>I lived in New York City in the late 80s, early 90s - the worst years, racial, crime chaos - Central Park Wilding rape, Al Sharpton Tawana Brawley, David Dinkins - the whole rot.</p>
<p>New York City didn&rsquo;t bottom out until the Black anti Jewish pogrom in Crown Heights Brooklyn - when there are mobs of Blacks/Non Whites screaming &#8220;kill the Jews&#8221; and an actual American Jewish person is murdered, that seems to do the trick - that&rsquo;s the sign that things have hit bottom and lots of forces will come in to play to turn things around.</p>
<p>After this pogrom/riot - all Whites in New York City including jews voted for Guliani and the NYPD clean up of the City - the clean up worked.</p>
<p>I was hoping that another 9-11-01 Muslim terrorist attack against American Jewish targets by illegal aliens might turn things our way on immigration, but you never know, the 9-11-01 attacks didn&rsquo;t do the trick.</p>

<p>I wonder about stuff like that.  With all the talk about diversity in the workplace, affirmative action, social justice and blah, blah, blah&hellip; - how come non-whites can get away with actively hiring their own and no one else who is different?</p>
<p>LAtino businesses NEVER hire whites, blacks or asians.  Why has no one ever did a study?  Asians almost NEVER hire whites, especially for low level jobs.  Blacks always hire only blacks.  Indo-paks only hire their relatives and people from the village.  When was the last time you saw an Asian owned business of any size with a black worker?  Pretty rare thing, I suspect.  On it goes, but only white majority businesses need to reflect the rainbow.  Everyone else gets an &#8216;equal opportunity&rsquo; pass.</p>
<p>Where are the multi-culturalists and diversity people when &#8216;diverse&rsquo; peoples have nothing to do with each other?</p>
<p>Someone needs to bring this up in the press and in the courts.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hitler, Hitler, Hitler, Hitler&hellip;for a society allegedly so repulsed by the man, dead these seven decades, we can&rsquo;t seem to go two seconds without someone, somewhere invoking his name. rather ironic, is it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not really.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew he did not belong to them; he knew that, like the vampires, he was anathema and black terror to be destroyed. And, abruptly, the concept came, amusing to him even in his pain.</p>
<p>A coughing chuckle filled his throat. He turned and leaned against the wall while he swallowed the pills. Full circle, he thought while the final lethargy crept into his limbs. Full circle. A new terror born in death, a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever.</p>

<p>His defeat and destruction at the hands of the victorious Allies in 1945 guaranteed his elevation (or descent?) to the status of universal bogeyman by all good Fabian and Marxian Socialists everywhere.  Talk about Satan attacking the Devil!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no &#8220;trick&#8221;.  I&rsquo;ve lived in Zoo York City my whole life.  This city is finished!  It is well on its way to becoming another Detroit; a process that will undoubtedly be hastened after this country&rsquo;s sovereign debt crisis reaches its inevitable conclusion.  I can&rsquo;t wait to retire so I can get out of here!</p>
