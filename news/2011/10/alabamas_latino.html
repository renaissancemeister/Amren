<h1>Alabama&rsquo;s Latino Community Urges Spanish Speakers to Miss Work</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News Latino, October 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Take the day off  &mdash;  to protest the harsh laws targeting undocumented immigrants in Alabama.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what some in the state&rsquo;s Latino community are encouraging Spanish-speaking residents to do, all to counter Alabama&rsquo;s efforts to fight against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Facebook users have formed groups and events urging people to skip work on Wednesday and Thursday. They&rsquo;re also asking people to only shop at businesses that are part of the Hispanic community. Hundreds have said they&rsquo;re participating.</p>
<p>A Spanish-language radio station in metro Birmingham is helping promote the campaign. {snip}</p>
<p>In heavily Hispanic Albertville, city officials say some Hispanic businesses are planning to close Wednesday. {snip}</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Day Without a Mexican&#8221; protest on May 1, 2006 was a lovely day in Los Angeles.  The freeways were clear and people got a reminder of how it was before the invasion.  It didn&rsquo;t exactly have the intended effect.</p>

		<p>We had one of these &#8220;Day Without Mexicans&#8221; things awhile back. For one day, I didn&rsquo;t see <i>mamacita</i> letting her kids urinate in the supermarket parking lot; I didn&rsquo;t hear any blasting <i>ranchero</i> music from low rider cars; I didn&rsquo;t have to wait at the checkout counter behind some illegal alien who didn&rsquo;t know how to make his EBT swipe card work as my ice cream melted.</p>
<p>I also made a mental note of Mexican owned businesses, and never patronized them again. Funny thing was, a lot of those businesses closed their doors within six months.</p>
<p>Way to show <i>el blanco</i> who&rsquo;s in charge.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad the Mestizos are hastening their ouster! I hope 100% of them participate. The more that do, the greater the pain they&rsquo;ll feel, for the greater the country will shun them, and work to remove them all. Hopefully we can count on Mestizo chauvinism and stupidity, to sink them!</p>
<p>Things are looking brighter.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re illegal aliens, they&rsquo;re not allowed to have jobs and employers are not allowed to hire them.  Where they don&rsquo;t show up to work, then you&rsquo;ll know an employer to pump for information, either you have the employer on knowingly hiring an illegal, or an illegal for identity fraud.</p>

		<p>This happened in my howmtown several years ago when there was that huge national protest. One mexican restaurant, that everyone loved and frequented, closed the doors for a day to allow the workers to protest. People who had eaten there over the years were ticked that the workers didn&rsquo;t take into account how the city had literally adopted the workers and kept them in business and took their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>I know their business suffered horribly and I think they went out of business.</p>

		<p>Mestizos once again demonstrate that arrogance and stupidity are a dangerous combination, or at least it would be if we actually enforced immigration law in this country. In any event, I hope every illegal invading Mestizo decides to stay home from that job he stole from an American citizen! </p>
<p>That will show us!  </p>

		<p>I like it - I like it and I&rsquo;ll tell ya why! This absolutely smacks of desperation. Whenever I see a group resort to tactics that seem so obviously counterintuitive, I know they are feeling panicky on some level - and that is good! </p>
<p>With the economy remaining in very questionable straits, the Invaders have lost a lot of allies in the mainstream it would seem. Folks worrying about their own jobs, their homes, healthcare, food prices and what-not, are just not all that likely to be worried about this Illegal-Invader boo-hooing!<br>

		<p>Remember the recent Amren article about the Mextizo who put his semen into some yogurt and offered it to a white girl?  Remember the discussions?  DON&rsquo;T EAT AT ANY MEXICAN RESTAURANTS OR MEXTIZO WORKERS OCCUPIED RESTAURANT.  You can bet they are spitting and worse in your food.  Don&rsquo;t patronize any business that hires Mextizos, whatever it is.</p>
<p>I have been growing a garden and canning produce for three years now.  This year, I began keeping my own hens.  Its fun and healthful.  I hasn&rsquo;t weaned me completely from the produce department, but I buy much less.  So I do my own farming, and it isn&rsquo;t bad, in fact I find it satisfying.  These are some of the things whites must do if they are serious about the future.  Those who are still sitting around complaining and then tuning into NFL and NBA weekends have a long ways to go.</p>

		<p>Adult illegal immigrants come to the USA to permanantly fill jobs that used to be reserved for teenagers. When I was a teenager, some 25-30 years ago, my parents forced me to work to build character, help pay for my gas, clothes, etc. From age 14 until college, I cut lawns and unloaded trucks. It was moderate to hard work. i learned some valuable lessons and was proud of my work. In this day and age, a white teenagers are shunned from these jobs and most jobs. The immigrants, legal and illegal, make the same salary (and often less) that as I did 25 years ago.  They grow old feeding their large families, doing teenager work. The few white teenagers that are offered jobs also earn the same salary I did 25 years ago. It is the same number, about $6 hour, but today&rsquo;s money is worth much less. They really make about half as much as I did.  We never needed immigrants for these jobs. We had teengaers, retirees, uneducated, and the retarded to do the jobs. The greedy robber barrons wanted cheaper foriegn labor&hellip;but the cheap labor costs us billions in taxes and lost services.  Immigrants are often exploited while Americans had their country destroyed. Everyone lost&hellip;even the greedy business owners lose everything in the long run.</p>

<p>I stopped eating out 20 years ago when I noticed that Whites had been banned from restaurant employment.  The only restaurants in my area that employ Whites are the really high end dinner houses.</p>
<p>They have White bartenders and a few, very few White waiters.<br>
They have invented the hispanic assistant waiter so as to hire as few White waiters as possible.  Instead of covering 6 tables, the White waiters with the hispanic assistants now can cover 10 tables.</p>
<p>The White waiters take the orders, chat with customers, open the wine and present and take the bill to the cashier.  The hispanic assistants give the orders to the kitchen, bring the food and drink to the table, take away the dishes etc.</p>
<p>The only reason these high end dinner houses still have White waiters at all is because of appearance.  They want average height and weight average reasonable attractive waiters.  </p>
<p>The hispanics are all abnormally short, built like bowling balls on stumps and have pure indian features, shapeless blobby lips, noses like a potato and fat round faces with coarse large pored skin. They can hardly navigate around the tables with their potruding 60 inch waistlines.</p>
<p>I never, never go out to eat.  When people ask me, I invite them to my house for dinner.  They can bring steak, salmon, shrimp and wine if they want, but I don&rsquo;t go out to eat or drink, not even a coke at McDonald&rsquo;s on a hot day.</p>
<p>There is little Whites can do to save ourselves.  We have to buy food.  We can&rsquo;t avoid supermarkets, but we can and should avoid all restaurants all the time.</p>

		<p>Teenaged kids no longer have jobs at age 14 because of the &#8220;concerned&#8221;, &#8220;caring&#8221;, sniveling types who have passed laws making it virtually impossible.  Add to this all manner of reporting laws, paperwork, health insurance, and all the rest, and the business owners take the easy route: José works for cash and that&rsquo;s the end of it. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled extensively in the US and there are still places to be found where the children native to the area can, and do, get work.  I wonder if they, too, are working under the table? If they are, they may be learning to work, but they are getting a darn poor lesson in ethics.</p>

		<p>I used to live in an ethnic neighborhood in LA. I would sit at the cafe and speak with various Mexicans. Some were legal, some were illegal. They were reasonably nice to me. I rarely had a problem. They often told me what their lives were like. They would work hard and make very little money. They lived in  crowded communal  apartments and houses. Most of their salary was sent to family in Mexico. The rest went to food and rent. Some even asked, &#8220;why even come here?? This is miserable!&#8221;. I mostly felt badly for them. Tax free, slave wages don&rsquo;t help anyone. It is destroying the U.S. and enslaving some Mexicans (and other). Everyone loses. </p>
