			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andrew Breitbart, Big Government, October 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New photographs obtained exclusively by BigGovernment.com reveal that Barack Obama appeared and marched with members of the New Black Panther Party as he campaigned for president in Selma, Alabama in March 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The images, presented below, also renew doubts about the transparency of the White House&rsquo;s guest logs  &mdash;  in particular, whether Panther National Chief Malik Zulu Shabazz is the same &#8220;Malik Shabazz&#8221; listed among the Obama administration&rsquo;s early visitors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among those appearing with Obama was Shabazz, the Panther leader who was one of the defendants in the voter intimidation case that Attorney General Eric Holder dismissed. Also present was the Panthers&rsquo; &#8220;Minister of War,&#8221; Najee Muhammed, who had called for murdering Dekalb County, Georgia, police officers with AK-47&rsquo;s and then mocking their widows in this video (7:20  &mdash;  8:29).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The photographs show Obama sharing the same podium at the event with the Panthers.</p>
<p>In the first image, Shabazz stands at the podium, surrounded by uniformed Panthers, including Muhammed. In the second photograph, Obama commands the same podium.</p>
<p><br>
<img alt="Shabbaz.jpg" src="/news/2011/10/04/Shabbaz.jpg" width="422" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>
<p><br>
<img alt="Obama.jpg" src="/news/2011/10/04/Obama.jpg" width="374" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They spoke with Obama at the podium shown above, and departed together with Obama for the main march itself, as shown by this grainer image captured from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKdQ2J2ZGCE">YouTube</a>:</p>
<p><br>
<img alt="Crowd.jpg" src="/news/2011/10/04/Crowd.jpg" width="596" height="484" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After NPR initially <a href="https://m.npr.org/news/front/7708261?page=1">reported</a> that the Panthers were present at the event with Obama, subsequent reports from Selma omitted any mention of the hate group appearing with the future President.</p>
<p>Had any of Obama&rsquo;s opponents appeared at an event with the KKK or Aryan Nation, The New York Times would have had to double its ink buy.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I have been <a href="https://biggovernment.com/abreitbart/2010/09/24/which-malik-shabazz-visited-white-house-in-july-2009-mr-president/">calling</a> for the White House to disclose which Malik Shabazz visited the private White House residence on July 25, 2009, two months after the DOJ voter intimidation case was dismissed.  So far, the White House has refused to do so, leaving open the question of which &#8220;Malik Shabazz&#8221; appears in visitor logs released to the public.</p>

		<p>One day, somebody will put together an easy to read chronology of N&rsquo;Obmau-mau&rsquo;s hostile and dangerously anti White associations and comments.</p>
<p>Then, look for the government to come out with guidelines on how we are allowed to talk about our historic first African American president, &#8220;whom Americans overwhelmingly like as a person&#8221;.</p>
<p>Violators will be subjected to Sedition Acts penalties.  We will all cower in quiet servitude as soon as a few high profile Obama exposers just sort of quietly &#8220;vanish&#8221; without a trace.  <br>

<p>Are these all the photos?  Is that very fuzzy, grainy, bigfoot-like photo the only one with Obama and some black panther guy?</p>
<p>Not defending anyone, but bad, second rate, fake-o propaganda is more damaging to the cause than just presenting a case&hellip;</p>

		<p>In his book, Dreams From my Father, Obama reveals he met with members of the Nation of Islam in Chicago while working as a community organizer. He always includes these fringe (colored) groups in the discussion; he sympathizes with them and understands their plight but he always chooses the path of hope regardless of all the racist oppression. </p>

		<p>The man has no actual beliefs.  He is cardboard.  But he does know how to manipulate blacks to vote for him en masse. He knew that to be elected and stay elected, especially in a place like Chicago, he must be &#8220;down&#8221; with angry, hostile, dumb, white-hating blacks.  Since that describes his most loyal base and possibly the only real support he&rsquo;ll get this time around, look for him to play the &#8220;black&#8221; card even more.  </p>

		<p>There is an immediately encompassing issue here reaching beyond just one surprising (surprising?) revealed incident.  <br>
It would be solid, prosaic, tedious, old-fashioned ground-building fact digging to try to fill in large monthly 6x8 cards about the whole life of the<br>
President  &mdash;  where each month was he/ with whom might he have been interacting  &mdash;  i.e., physical propinquity of neighbors, school mates, teacher, etc. etc.  By any reasonable estimate, a large number of people would have memories of him.  Yet, when one tallies up the anecdotes, etc., it appears that relatively few people have publicly revealed anything.  The fellow is more of a &#8220;stage presence&#8221; than a discernible real-life person.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s unlikely that even one of Obama&rsquo;s nonwhite followers will find this offensive. What&rsquo;s sad is that a good many of his (evidently self-hating) white supporters haven&rsquo;t cared about his racist connections up until this point. I wonder whether this, even if it&rsquo;s spread far and wide, will open any eyes. I doubt it. </p>

		<p>The grainy photo was captured from a YouTube video (as was written).  These aren&rsquo;t photoshopped or manipulated.  Although it does not appear that Obama is directly conversing with the Panthers, his presence alone shows the double standard. </p>
<p>This is akin to a Republican candidate speaking at a rally soon after the grand wizard addresses a rowdy, all-white Southern crowd.  The photos, story, and issue would be on the internet within seconds and would completely end someone&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you have white friends who voted for and/or continue to support Obama, let them see these photos (and the YouTube video for those who believe they are fake).  Use this to segue why he cannot be trusted and to build racial consciousness (and a backbone) for fellow whites.  Glenn Beck was right initially.  Obama is a racist.<br>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my common sense for you:  I will never vote for Hillary Clinton, either.  They&rsquo;re all Democrats, they&rsquo;re all left-wing white-hating lunatics, except for the rare occasional Heath Shuler type.  They&rsquo;re all kooks who pander to the even kookier black vote and all the kooky pathological hate groups like &#8220;black panthers&#8221; that they can produce.</p>

		<p>Re #08<br>
The President seems just mesmerized by the daily political indoctrinations his mother injected into him from toddler time.<br>
I seriously doubt that he has attempted to travel mentally and emotionally into the mind of a conservative  &mdash;  like a spy looking around inside an enemy country  &mdash;  and THEN returning to his own mind and emotions.  If he did, when he got &#8220;back home&#8221; I don&rsquo;t think he could recall anything of his spy travel.  Tolerance?  </p>

		<p>I am unsurprised.  For a while during the 2007/2008 campaign Obama&rsquo;s official web site listed the New Black Panthers as one of his endorsers.  That was later removed, no doubt when the campaign staff decided it was prudent to keep some facts unadvertised. </p>

		<p>His true political colors have always been dark pink and lavender.<br>
But all the majority of voters could see in 2008 was Black.  So this is why we learned to &#8220;color&#8221; in kindergarten and first grade??</p>
