<h1>We&rsquo;re a Culture, Not a Costume Too</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin DeAnna, Youth for Western Civilization, October 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A student group at the University of Ohio has received praise from the mainstream media for its &#8220;We&rsquo;re a culture, not a costume&#8221; campaign.  The group is called Students Teaching About Racism in Society.  As with all multicultural groups, it is fundamentally a product of the administration, <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/orgs/stars/About_STARS.html">beginning in 1988 as a class</a>.  Ohio University also features a multicultural center with no fewer than 31 separate student organizations (including STARS) featured on the site.  The group&rsquo;s president is one Sarah Williams (age 24) who works in the school&rsquo;s Division of Student Affairs Office.  The Dean of Students, Ryan Lombardi, said &#8220;We were immediately receptive &hellip;  we thought they were great, well done, and professional.  We immediately agreed to fund them.&#8221;  Of course.</p>
<p><br>
<img alt="Original.jpg" src="/news/2011/10/28/Original.jpg" width="270" height="360" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>
<p><br>
As with any of these stories, when you read &#8220;students launch campaign,&#8221; mentally substitute &#8220;students who double as campus employees launch a campaign with funding and support from both the campus administration and a multicultural center that is exclusively dedicated to pushing their political goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the campaign began, dozens of other schools have also been requesting posters, which STARS will now receive $500-$1000 for.  Seeing as how many other schools have multicultural centers that do nothing but campaigns like this, demand will not go down anytime soon.</p>
<p>Why does STARS think this is necessary?  Well, people are dressing up on Halloween.  For example, someone might dress up like an Arab terrorist, or wear blackface, or dress up like a geisha.  This is Very Bad and worthy of a campus-wide campaign.</p>
<p>After all, says Williams, &#8220;Nobody wants to dress up as Thurgood Marshall, W.E.B. DuBois, or Barack Obama.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, don&rsquo;t tell all the people making <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=barack%20obama%20halloween%20costume&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=332l5598l0l5726l30l13l0l15l15l1l269l2197l2.6.5l23l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=632&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=iw">Barack Obama costumes</a>.</p>
<p>(Not sure you could dress up as W.E.B DuBois.  You could perhaps have a two-part costume with a white person dressing as someone he <a href="https://www.mltranslations.org/Miscellaneous/DuBoisJVS.htm">eulogized</a> as a &#8220;great man,&#8221; Joseph Stalin.)</p>
<p>There has been some opposition, mostly talking about how the group is taking everything too seriously and this is just a joke.  This is true of course.  The hallmark of the contemporary left is how utterly humorless they are, which leads to their ever-more frantic attempts to regulate speech and private organizations.  It&rsquo;s not unusual to watch them literally <a href="https://www.westernyouth.org/articles/providence-college-newspaper-censors-dr.-trifkovic/">burst into tears</a> when they hear different opinions or begin screaming for the administration to shut down their opponents.  Even the most cowardly campus conservative can usually withstand listening to a progressive without succumbing to hysteria. </p>
<p>This misses the point though.  As with all political questions, this is about who, not what.  There are no white students in the campaign because white privilege tells us that whites are incapable of being oppressed (unless they&rsquo;re homosexuals of course.)  If you&rsquo;re a white student, you might feel oppressed you have to sit through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/goacta">orientation programs</a> that tell you you&rsquo;re evil, attend classes that summarize the entire history of your people and your country as racism and oppression, have professors curse you out or occasionally <a href="https://www.wnd.com/?pageId=32984">call for your extermination</a>, face discrimination in admissions when you apply for jobs when you graduate, and get through college without various centers, task forces, programs, student groups, counselors and special classes to coddle you for four years (or however long it takes).  This is actually just proof of your racism.  </p>
<p>Therefore, we&rsquo;ll never see a campaign like this against costumes that mock, say, rednecks, or priests, or the Palin family.  In fact, the Huffington Post fell all over itself to promote this campaign, but also has featured articles mocking the Palin family with costumes (including Bristol).  Just a joke right? </p>
<p>European-Americans, believing Christians, or political conservatives, are allowed to be attacked and mocked openly.  Nor will school administrations throw money at them or dedicate entire departments to making sure their feelings are not hurt.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;re ok with this of course, because we don&rsquo;t want special privileges.  We also think Halloween is about having fun, not grim propaganda campaigns designed to ruin things for everyone else, which seems to be what multiculturalism is all about. </p>
<p>This campaign is a sick joke, and it should be treated like a joke.  If this is serious, and we have to treat it as serious, then why is it ok to mock some groups but not others?  We have to be willing to say that it&rsquo;s not funny to dress as a Viking, or a slutty nun, or a redneck, or a priest.  If not, then it becomes apparent what this is, another expression of the rage of a <a href="https://www.westernyouth.org/articles/left-wing-hate-your-tax-dollars-at-work/">privileged class</a>.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be posting more flyers over the next couple days.  Feel free to print them out and distribute them on your campus.  You&rsquo;ll have to do it yourself, as recipients of &#8220;privilege&#8221; we won&rsquo;t have school administrations throwing money at us.  The full-size versions are available as PDF downloads next to &#8220;Download attachments:&#8221; below.  Be sure to take pictures of places you put them up and send them to info@westernyouth.org.  You may want to take video footage of you asking people what they think about the flyers. Send that to us also.</p>

		<p>&#8220;attend classes that summarize the entire history of your people and your country as racism and oppression, have professors curse you out or occasionally call for your extermination, face discrimination in admissions&#8221;</p>
<p>This has happened to me, including the cursing.  </p>
<p>What is amazing to me is that race relations altogether have worsened a great, great deal since the 1970s.  From my personal experience is where I speak, and that is that I grew up in a very racially and culturally (note that they are two separate things) diverse section of Atlanta and at that time, no one I knew of any age or background discriminated against each other; we are were great neighbors, schoolmates, workmates, and friends.  </p>
<p>Maybe the difference was that none of us were forced to be together or to get along.  It just happened.  </p>
<p>By the way, as a child, we were rather limited with money so my mother would dress me as a hobo, aka, bum.  Would that get us in trouble now with the homeless?</p>

		<p>Youth for Western Civilization has just thrown it right back in their Liberal faces. Good for them!</p>
<p>This is exactly what I was referring to about taking action against these brain-dead Liberals, who are the useful idiots of the Communists. </p>
<p>Now we must organize, and protest, and shout down these people, the same way they have done to us, over the past decades. Two can play this game, and we are only warming up.</p>

		<p>When I first saw these &#8220;we&rsquo;re a culture&#8221; ads it occurred to me that there&rsquo;s going to be an instant backlash.  I&rsquo;m sure it never dawned on these libs that conservatives could make the same argument.  They&rsquo;re so used to playing the victim that it never occurred that traditionalists might be offended by some stereotypes, too.  </p>

		<p>Today I saw two little White girls dressed for Halloween. One was a devil and the other a mod hippie.</p>
<p>I was deeply offended that Whiteys think they can used their racist unearned White privilege to stigmatize Hell and the 1960s as the sole properties of Whites.</p>
<p>Until little White girls dress as Rosa Parks and Michelle Obama, we will have much more work to do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve witnessed this frequently on two separate college campuses, usually from feminists, but also from black and hispanic activists (females).  In every case, the &#8220;offended&#8221; student was not only crying but also yelling hysterically.  They&rsquo;ve been trained that emotional displays win all arguments, so the more they scream and cry, the more they win.  Professors <i>never</i> stepped in to take back classroom decorum. </p>
<p>Please note: most of the time I was the only person in the audience or classroom looking amused or stifling giggles.  All other students were <i>frozen</i> in awkwardness and avoiding eye-contact.  Modern students are pitifully afraid of &#8220;offending&#8221; anyone of the feminist/multicultural persuasion.  Never underestimate leftist conditioning.  </p>

		<p>The diversity and PC crowd are nothing if not humorless.  Stereotypes exist for a reason.  There is truth to them.   Nearly all blacks try for the ghetto gang banger look.<br>
Native Americans do like to dress up in feathers and costumes that their ancestors never wore, ever, in order to take in that tourist money, but god God don&rsquo;t ever dress as one on Halloween.  Muslims do look the other way and say nothing when their kids and women are trained to strap bombs on themselves for &#8220;martyrdom&#8221; and Allah.  The most they will say is &#8220;it&rsquo;s not Islam&#8221; but outright condemnation and outrage?  Nah.  I&rsquo;ve seen this article posted elsewhere and it included asians, and other ethnic groups.<br>
So what?  If they resent the stereotype, then how about they stop behaving the stereotype?</p>

		<p>#7 Senior: Have you ever noticed that when you are debating a Liberal, if you could call it that, and their arguments don&rsquo;t quite meet up with the facts that are presented, they get more and more agitated, and begin getting louder and louder, and before you know it they are screaming at the top of their lungs like a maniac?</p>
<p>I really enjoy that, too. There is nothing quite as entertaining than driving a truck through all the Liberal arguments, with Conservative and Nationalist facts, that are rock solid, and sending the Red faced Liberals into hyperventilation fits. </p>

<p><br>
True, but the same certainly can&rsquo;t be said for liberals. A friend of mine on FB posted an obituary, mourning the loss of common sense in America, and I commented on her post that common sense hadn&rsquo;t actually died, but rather had been murdered by loony liberals. Another friend of the same person who proudly called herself a liberal took great offence at my little joke, and posted a wall of text that bordered on madness. It was an hysterical, hate filled, foul languaged rant that jumped from one topic to the next, and you can imagine how much worse it got when I thanked her for proving my point. People like her can&rsquo;t stand it when anyone can go toe to toe with them and not back down.</p>

		<p>Awesome- time someone fought back against the thin skinned minorities freaking out. Nobody would even say anything about lampooning European or White American cultural icons but run around screaming at the stupid costumes pictured.

		<p>I love YWC.  That group is sharp, good writers.  The irony I&rsquo;m sure is lost on these young, budding leftists.  If that&rsquo;s not who he is and that doesn&rsquo;t represent his culture then what&rsquo;s his problem?  Isn&rsquo;t that costume making fun of something that&rsquo;s NOT him? To make a legitimate claim that something offends you it would have to say &#8220;This IS who I am and this is not OK.&#8221; Also, if it&rsquo;s not who he is, why does he purposefully associate himself with that image? If that&rsquo;s not who you are, why would you get offended? Fine, that&rsquo;s not who you are&hellip;if you insist, although you seem to be suggesting otherwise simultaneously by posing with that picture. What it&rsquo;s missing is any evidence that people actually think this what he is. Who is the bad guy in this scenario?  &#8220;Society&#8221; again?  &#8220;Society&#8221; i.e. white people? The only racial group in society that CAN&rsquo;T claim victim status? Once again white people take the blame all around. How this farce translates into giving anyone the authority to be the Halloween costume police is beyond me.</p>
<p>How about &#8220;This is who I&rsquo;m claiming you think I am so I can bask in victim status and receive all the accolades the academic community bestows upon people who have achieved this status.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s what it is really, an achievement&hellip;they&rsquo;ve achieved entitlement to funding through a laughably false, transparent claim of persecution&hellip;by a Halloween costume.</p>

		<p>I thought Islam was a religion, or a socio-political system, or what have you&hellip;Not a culture and certainly not a race. </p>
<p>Muslims, and consqequently the jihadists among them, range from Bosnians to Indonesians. </p>
<p>So, actually, Muslims, no, you are not a culture. Sorry.</p>
<p>About Arabs:<br>
Even the Arab culture could hardly be considered a culture. In truth, the cultures of the Levant and North Africa are very much influenced by pre-Islamic Mediterranean cultures, not Arab. The long dead Sassanian kind was 100% correct in calling the Arab tribes &#8220;lizardeaters&#8221;. </p>
<p>Many Maronites in Lebanon are INSULTED when called an Arab. How about that, eh?</p>

		<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t see what Vikings have to do with Western Civ whatsoever. How about creating one of those &#8220;we are a culture&#8221; posters showing an Italian stereotype? I am so sick of them!</p>
<p>There are 1000s of Northern and Central Italians who feel that shows like &#8220;Jersey Shore&#8221; and mafia stereotypes are wrongly applied to a nation that contributed more to our civilization than any other. </p>
<p>Bank of America? Fillipo Mazzei? Ring a bell? Hopefully. </p>
<p>The WASPs of the old made a mistake when they discriminated against North and Central Italian immigrants. Big mistake. Now, it seems, justice is turning its head  &mdash;  -but at such an inopportune moment!</p>
<p>Alpine-Dinaric pride for life!!!</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Heck, even Neapolitans and Calabrians don&rsquo;t feel too strong about stuff like this even though they have Greek and North African origins (Numidian, Phoenician, etc. Mostly antic heritages)&hellip;.</p>

		<p>And yet, men are allowed to dress as women any time they wish to and the lefties support it. They don&rsquo;t associate it with the patriarchy it represents. That is, that men, gay men, can misappropriate women&rsquo;s idendities for their own use. In San Francisco a gay man can nominate a man who dresses as a woman as &#8220;Woman of the year&#8221; with a straight face. The trannie won, by the by.</p>

		<p>Just another example of the laid back, hypocritical, passive-aggressive bullying the politically correct lib-lefty pontificating mandarins of higher level education and advocacy engage in - nay, &#8220;earn&#8221; their livings at - on a constant basis.  </p>
<p>Have been for decades now - like five to be exact.  Little marked milestone here in 2011 - the 50 year anniversary of Kennedy signing into effect &#8220;Affirmative Action&#8221;.</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m in favor of a meritocracy, public and private.  Other than the devolved-dysgenic trustfundwunder phenomenon and good old fashioned natural human propensity toward cronyism and vice, the private sector has been a mightier bulwark against the War on Merit known as Affirmative Action than government, to be sure.  But even that&rsquo;s under assault now.</p>
<p>Its like wet-rot.  Seeping and creeping malaise of mediocrity, victim-privilege, excuse making, standard lowering that creates its own sad inertia.</p>
<p>Let me make myself clear, Amrenners.  I am &#8220;proud&#8221; to be a White American.  English, Scottish, French, Swedish&hellip;maybe a Quaker Amerindian on one side, a Southern Ladino Jew somewhere way back on the other (my &#8220;Pelasgian&#8221; White substrata).  I place pride in quotes, by the way, as I&rsquo;m very wary of the concept from a religious standpoint, but the language perhaps fails us in this manner.  </p>
<p>But I have no problem with the blackest of black, blue gummed, thick lipped, kinky headed, flare nostriled, subsaharan African attaining to the maximum his or her talents, abilities, virtues, and fortune can take him or her.  And I know for a fact that there exist MANY non-white, non-eastasian individuals who are perfectly capable of competing and peacefully coexisting alongside and among, the first two groups.  </p>
<p>But I also know, based on REAL SCIENCE and hard lived personal experience&hellip;</p>
<p>That those of certain nonwhite/eastasian groups are significantly less likely to be able to compete at the higher levels AND&hellip;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not my damned fault&hellip;</p>

		<p>Their idea is right, but the execution is completely wrong. Their flyers fail to make the point because those are <i>White people</i> dressed as White cultural stereotypes. They need to find pictures of non-Whites dressed as princesses, vikings, knights, rednecks, etc. and couple them with a picture of a White person looking horribly offended. The point that needs to be made is that non-Whites are not only allowed but encouraged to appropriate White culture for their own means. </p>
<p>A better flyer would be to show Heimdall, as portrayed by a Black actor in the recent Thor movie or a Black man dressed as Santa Claus or some other blatant offense against White culture and norms. Showing White people mocking White people completely misses the point. </p>

<p>During the &#8220;great Italian&#8221; migration, WASPS were in control of the US and those &#8220;old&#8221; WASPS you insult did allow Italian immigrants into the nation they created and founded. </p>
<p>For this, you should be thankful instead of insulting.</p>

<p>Though I am a quarter Italian myself, I have to say I do think we let too many in during the late 1800&rsquo; and early 1900&rsquo;s.  I would also point out to the poster your words were directed to, that the vast majority of Italian immigrants were NOT northern/central Italians, they were southern Italians and Sicilians.</p>
<p>But the fact is that this country was founded by WASPs, for WASPs.  At the time of independance, America was one-half English (with much of the rest being other forms of British), and 98% Protestant.</p>

		<p>Cui Bono,</p>
<p>Good points. Italian Americans etc&hellip; are allowed to come on here and take a jab at WASPs but Heaven forbid we do them the same favor. Quite frankly, I think we are all in this together, and I don&rsquo;t like the division.  However, it is during discussions like this that I can&rsquo;t help but throw a few back. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d better be careful though.  The last time I argued with a Mediterranean supremacist on here, I got falsely misquoted by saying something I never even said, and I got labeled as a Nordicist which I am not.  All I did was defend WASPS against what this &#8220;racially conscious&#8221; Italian American on American Renaissance was saying about us, obviously trying to start a fight with us. The sad thing was that most people were okay with him doing it, but Heaven forbid, that I, a WASP fight back.</p>
<p>All I am going to say is this:  Northern, Central, Eastern, and Southern Europeans, have all contributed to Western Civilization in different ways.  And when looking at the big picture here in America, we need to be working together.  </p>
<p>Having said that, I dated an Italian American from New York City once who I met at an Amren conference. He spent a good amount of time lecturing me on how this WASPY country called America was pretty sorry until the other European ethnicities started showing up, such as the Poles, Italians etc&hellip;.  He even tried to prove to me that there has never been one great American that has done anything of importance who was of fully English/ WASPy lineage.  </p>
<p>We obviously argued a lot and it didn&rsquo;t last long. As a young woman (still) I am turning my sights on marrying a fellow Scotch-Irish Southern Baptist gentleman so that I don&rsquo;t have to put up with this again (whoops, I got in trouble for having a preference for who I want to marry last time I got into this discussion on here as well.  Heaven forbid I want to marry someone as similar to me as possible!).</p>
<p>All I am saying, is, I for one don&rsquo;t like these discussions turning up on Amren.  However, when it comes to this country, even though we are all in this together, I expect to start seeing WASPs treated with a little more respect since we were the ones who created the country and who decided to let the rest of Europe immigrate here.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a WASP, but a French American and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more that the US was indeed founded by WASPs for WASPs.  My French ancestors may have colonized and explored North America from Canada to Louisiana before the US even existed (New France: 1534-1763) as well as fought along Americans to defeat the Brits (Lafayette, Rochambeau, de Grasse), BUT I&rsquo;d be the first one to admit that the US was always a WASP country since the beginning.  Any other White community, including mine, ought to recognize that fact and thank the WASPs for allowing us to become Americans.</p>
<p>By the way, Italy was not unified until 1861 and the overwhelming majority of Italians didn&rsquo;t migrate to the US until the 1880&rsquo;s when this country had already been settled from coast to coast.  Sorry, but all that comprised modern Italy did not contribute &#8220;more to our civilization than any other&#8221; nation.  A lot has changed since Rome and the Renaissance, you know, like the Age of Reason and the Industrial Revolution which took place in England, France, Germany and the US.  Some people here really need to get over their own ethnicity, and start focusing on the bigger picture !<br>

<p>Super Wealthy WASPS did not betray whites.  Outside ethnic interests that look out for only themselves and not whites,  have been driving the 70-year planned destruction of whites.  Look closely:  They have control of US academia, the government and the media.</p>

Rich donors buy and pay for political candidates, up to and including Obama.  Rich donors buy candidates to fund their agenda, not yours, including the wars in the Middle East.  Candidates do the bidding of their largest donors, if they don&rsquo;t, their rival will be lavishly funded, they will be smeared in the media and they know it</p>
<p>Their agenda includes destroying whites through AA programs, forcing diversity on whites, keeping the southern border wide open, allowing and encouraging massive nonwhite immigration into white lands.  These things are not in dispute and spell the end of white America.</p>

		<p>This is for Cui Bono and others who are participating in this conversation:</p>
<p>I believe you have grossly misunderstood me. But let explain a thing or two about Italian Americans first.</p>
<p>Like I said, unlike 90% of the so-called &#8220;Italians&#8221; in the US, I can trace my roots north of Campania. <br>
I am not Mediterranean(not to put them down or anything&hellip;), nor Nordic/Germanic, nor am I a supremacist. I am DINARIC-ALPINE. Do you understand the difference? We are more similar to Yugoslavs, Occitanians, Basques, Catalonians, Romanians, and Hungarians. </p>
<p>Southern Italians, on the other hand, are very similar to Syrians/Lebanese, North Africans, and Greeks as their antic origins are in those places. Again, I&rsquo;m not defaming Southern Italian or Syrian or Lebanese folks. </p>
<p>Napolitania aka Southern Italy has a different history and culture than the rest of the peninsula. Unlike the relatively free city states in the center and north, it was autocratically ruled. It was called Kingdom of Naples. These dictatorial and foreign regimes are in part responsible for a much lower cultural output in S. Italy relative to the rest of the peninsula.</p>
<p>As far as the patterns of immigration are concerned, most of the &#8220;Italians&#8221; in NYC were actually immigrants from the Kingdom of Naples. In California, they were mostly of Lucchese(Tuscan) or Genovesi(Ligurian) descent. These folks are largely responsible for the succesful multi-billion dollar agriculture industry in Cali. Unlike Southern Italians, they were far more entrepreneurial and that explains why they came to Cali, not to NYC.</p>

		<p>Now, Cui Bono, what do you mean by &#8220;not true&#8221;?<br>
   Ask any self-respecting Tusco-Ligurian American if Jersey Shore represents him/her and they will spit you in the face. Same response if you ask him about the mafia.<br>
   Jersey Shore is supposed to be a representation of Italo-New Yorkers. I already explained to you about them. <br>
Mafia is absent in Italy other than in, again, Campania, Calabria, Sicily, and Apulia, not in Rome, Tuscany, Umbria, Lombardy, or Bologna. Italy would also have the largest GDP per capita  and purchasing power in Europe if the south separates, not to mention the cultural wealth. </p>
<p>SECODNLY, I have nothing against WASPS. I do think they played an integral role in creating this country, a land of opportunity without parallel in history . All I am saying is that they were needlessly and mistakengly prejudiced against the Irish, North/Central Italians, Polish and Yugoslavian immigrants. In fact, they should have encouraged more of this immigration. </p>
<p>Today, the immigrants coming to this country are mostly from South Asia, East Asia, and other non-Western third world countries. Thanks to white guilt and this multiculturalism, these people are often given PREFERENTIAL treatment. </p>
<p>Unlike the Northern Italians who harbored no malice towards the WASP establishment, the Indians(from India) do and are determined to supplant it. This doesn&rsquo;t just apply to Indians, but also to other such Asian Third World immigrants. </p>
<p>And it looks like they are succeeding. The media is brainwashing young, white children and Western culture is being spit on&hellip; Meanwhile, Third Worlders are being kissed up to anywhere you turn your head. America is fading away.</p>
<p>I do not want to see things end this way. Americans of Western origins  &mdash;  -Italian, Irish, Pole, German, Portuguese, Croatian, you name it  &mdash;    &mdash;  must put their differences aside, at least partially, and recognize the greatness and interconnectedness of their heritage. They also need to band together and defend their interests, just like Indians/Hindus, Muslims(CAIR ring a bell?), or other. Otherwise, kiss America goodbye.</p>

<p>Are minorities really that sensitive or are they encouraged to be sensitive and to &#8220;take action&#8221; by the WhiteGuilt and/or leftist-Jewish politicians? </p>
<p>I personally think it&rsquo;s more of the latter.</p>

		<p><i>SECONDLY, I have nothing against WASPS. I do think they played an integral role in creating this country, a land of opportunity without parallel in history .</i></p>
<p>This will be my final post on this thread. I too do not like to see whites at each other&rsquo;s throats.  We have enough enemies to fight without turning on each other.</p>
<p>With that introduction:</p>
<p>WASPS did not &#8220;play an integral role&#8221; in creating this country, WASPS <b>FOUNDED</b> this country. </p>
<p>The Declaration of Independence was written and signed by WASPS, The Revolutionary War was waged and fought by WASPS and the Framers of Constitution of the United States were  WASPS.</p>
<p>The MAIN Founders and Creators of the United States are : John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington. All except nine delegates at the Federal Convention in 1787 were natives of the 13 Colonies, four were born in Ireland, two in England, two in Scotland, and one in the West Indies.  </p>
<p>Despite what modern PC dictates, the United States was not founded by Native Americans or Blacks; nor was it founded by Italians.  It was created by WASPS seeking not freedom, but liberty.</p>
<p><i>Ask any self-respecting Tusco-Ligurian American if Jersey Shore represents him/her and they will spit you in the face.</i></p>
<p>I asked my husband this question, a third generation Italian-American, whose grandparents emigrated to the United States from Rome, Napoli and Sicily.</p>
<p>He takes no offense at Jersey Shore, uses the word &#8220;guido&#8221; himself as an endearment when around friends and relatives.  He understands that the land that produced the clowns on Jersey Shore also produced Galileo, Marconi, Leonardo Da Vinci and was the birthplace of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>He also knows that Italians neither founded nor created the United States, said his penniless Italian ancestors were grateful to enter this country for the opportunities it provided. Opportunities afforded by the Constitution written by WASPS seeking liberty.</p>
<p>Shame none of this is taught any longer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an article that might interest you as to why Southern Italy is poorer than Northern Italy:  <a href="/ar/2010/05/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2010/05/index.html</a></p>

		<p>Cui Bono, you don&rsquo;t have to approve this if you don&rsquo;t want to. </p>
<p>But his land(apart from Rome, of course) produced no such folks.</p>
<p>Remember, Kingdom of Naples=/=Italy. Napolitania has a different historical legacy. From the Arabs who ruled it and changed its genetic composition to the dictatorial Bourbons. <br>
Galileo, Marconi, and DaVinci were Central Italian folks.  </p>
<p>Southern Italy is not as economically poor as it is culturally. </p>

<p>&#8220;Awesome- time someone fought back against the thin-skinned minorities freaking out. Nobody would even say anything about lampooning European or White American cultural icons but run around screaming at the stupid costumes pictured. They really don&rsquo;t believe whites or Europeans have a culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are no thin-skinned. Outrage is calculated, figured emotion. In other words, fake. People do what they think they can get away with. Until someone stops them.</p>

		<p>Just a clarification:  Joseph Stalin was not a white man.  He was a mixed-race Asian/white hybrid, as are all the people from the Asian state of Georgia, not to be confused with the U.S. state of Georgia.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do the names Bush, Pilsbury, and Rockefeller, sound familiar?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rockefellers are a Jewish family of German origin. They are not White Anglo-saxon Protestants.</p>
<p>And what about the Rothschilds, Heinz, Goldwyns, Meyers, Spielbergs, Rothsteins (Sumner Redstone&rsquo;s real surmane), Spellings, Diamonds, Singers, Goldmans, Sachs, Zuckerbergs, Zuikers, and countless others&hellip;? Now, do THOSE names ring a bell, my friend?</p>
<p>Man, sometimes I think contemporary Americans are blind (no offense intended)&hellip;</p>

		<p>#53: Rockefeller&rsquo;s religion, in several books, was listed as Baptist. Regardless, they have nothing to do with Christianity.</p>
<p>He has written in his Memoirs that he is a Globalist, and proud of it. His intention is to undermine this Republic, and subject its people to a Totalitarian State.  </p>
<p>The gaggle of those you have listed are completely behind his moves toward that goal. Big surprise. Bush and Company, and all of the others, belong to all the Secret Societies that have Satanic rites at the core of their beliefs. </p>
