		<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but this looks like a map of conquest! Look at the flow - whites are going down the toilet! Because their is no common place for whites to rally and oppose the aggression I suggest that you gather as much ammunition and food as you can. Imagine yourself in an apocalyptic world. Amren will not help you - they are the informer - not the enabler! Sooner or later - you take your last breath! What do you expect then?    </p>

<p>I see what you are thinking, but consider that the most populated states (CA,TX,FL,NY) are probably all at 40% white and other large states like IL and PA are at 60%. This is how as a country we are over 50% nonwhite, but the map will still show no green. If the 85-90% white states like ID,WY, and WV had 10 million white people instead of 2 million (or less) than the country would still be majority white.</p>

		<p>This map, acc to the linked article, subscribes to the Census Bureau&rsquo;s inclusion of Latinos/Chicanos/&#8221;La Raza&#8221; as being Hispanic whites. </p>
<p>Does anyone know who, when, and why got the Census to accept the indigenous peoples of Central and South America as &#8220;Hispanic whites&#8221;?</p>

		<p>It would be more insight-useful if state boundaries were <br>
obscured and simply the incidence given for major metropolitan<br>
population clusters and outlying larger and larger concentrics.<br>
Also, the same for merely cities (Amarillo, e.g. ).  We need to identify the clusters where the &#8220;us / them&#8221; ratio is least unfavorable to us.  Overlay this with rate of growth stats, etc.<br>
etc. and we could develop for ourselves a really sophisticated<br>
survival map.  It&rsquo;ll have to be done online somehow  &mdash;  ya ain&rsquo;t gonna git it from Barnes and Noble or Amazon. Given the the graying segment of our people, and given that lots of grays like to &#8220;snowbird&#8221;  &mdash;  we might consider race-friendly enclaves nearby outside of our borders (portions of a soon-to-be opened-up Cuba; Costa Rica, portions of N. Mexico carefully carefully demarcated, etc., where, in fact, the seniors could spend as much as 8 months a year apart from their homeland anchor point.  </p>

		<p>The choice is simple.  Send the illegals home and limit non white immigration into the country or give up on our society and culture.  Our future is a flat roof hut and a small patch of corn if we do nothing at all.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to see how these shades of color would be for the different states if only persons 21 years old or younger were included, or those just entering the school system at five years old. While the present system is still dominated by whites, I shudder to think what the future is for those of a younger age who are going to be entering the job market or university in the next few decades.</p>
<p>The whole system is breaking down before our eyes and we need to start working harder than ever for the newest generations of European-Americans who at present have only a dismal future to look forward to given present population trends.</p>

		<p>I think that the Northern States are mostly white because of their climate. Hispanics and blacks can&rsquo;t stand the cold. White people are more rugged. Blacks and hispanics come from warm climates. Plus the North is closer to Canada than Mexico. White people may one day have to make their stand in the Northern part of the country. </p>

<p>I have to disagree with this statement. As a Canadian, and living in a city where average temperatures are below freezing for five months of the year, we&rsquo;ve seen a huge influx of black and brown people. In the United States, Minneapolis is &#8216;Somali Central&rsquo;, and Somalis also relocated en masse from balmy Georgia to wintry Maine. In Europe, you&rsquo;ll find Somalis concentrated in the cooler north rather than the sunny south. For Pete&rsquo;s sake, they&rsquo;re building a big mosque in Inuvik in Canada&rsquo;s Northwest Territories, which is north of the Arctic Circle!</p>
<p>Blacks and Hispanics will move to wherever white people are the majority, regardless of climate. That&rsquo;s because where white people are the majority, living conditions are much better than would be otherwise.</p>

		<p>I used to think what poster #12 did, that black and brown people don&rsquo;t like the cold and so there will still be some white places.  But look at Scandanavia - it is undergoing rapid africanization and arabization.</p>
<p>Canada has tons of haitians, south asians, even mexicans are going there.  I am in the northeast where the winters are really cold, and in the city I live in, whites are less than 30% of the population now.  What do we have to do, live on isolated farms or in caves?  They would follow us there too!</p>
<p>Imagine this continent 100 years from now.  Whites live in isolated pockets under constant attack.  Zimbabwae will happen here, but it will be BOTH blacks and mexicans and also some asians killing us, when they are not killing each other for the dwindling resources.</p>

		<p>Perry calls us &#8220;heartless,&#8221; and California is now giving illegals state-funded grants to attend college. We&rsquo;ve done it to ourselves, and we&rsquo;ve been doing it to ourselves since 1965. Oh, well, if we refuse to fight for it, we deserve to lose it. </p>

		<p>Ref. 06<br>
The politics and realities of this matter seem LOCAL and not STATEWIDE.  Within a border state in which my father &#8220;snowbirds&#8221;, the more perceptive and literate Whites are pretty keen on the detailed flow of undocumented people.  These invaders know keenly in which localities they have a foothold/beachhead.  Where local Majority disincentives  to this &#8220;invasion&#8221; ( always lawful disincentives ) get in place, then the local defense grows stronger.  Trendlines are reality in politics.  Creating a trendline population map of a border state would be a huge step foward.  Of course, it would be useful all over the nation, as matters now stand.  It would indicate just how White some white areas have proven to be.  </p>
