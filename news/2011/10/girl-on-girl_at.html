			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BJ Lutz and Natalie Martinez, NBC Chicago, October 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A pair of female Chicago Public High School students violently assaulted a fellow female student during class last week while at least four other students stood by and the teacher looked on in shock.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got angry and went ghetto on her,&#8221; the victim&rsquo;s best friend, a freshman at the school, told NBC Chicago on Wednesday. &#8220;Every day there&rsquo;s a fight. Today there was a fight in algebra.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the video, 14-year-old Jillian Salgado struggled to fend off her two attackers. A fourth woman appears to make an attempt to break up the fight before backing away. At one point, the assailants appear to slam the victim&rsquo;s head off a table.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Classmates said the teacher seen in the video was unable to stop the fight and that it took several security officers to break it up.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The teen suffered a concussion, a neck sprain and several scratches and bruises, but those injuries are minor compared to her emotional injuries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two aggressors, 17-year-old and 18-year-old sisters, have been suspended from school with further discipline pending, said CPS spokeswoman Marielle Sainvilus.</p>

		<p>Typical. So typical.  What else can I say, except, that as Whites continue to lose their country, this sort of thing is coming to a school near you.  As a matter of fact it is already at a school near you.  At a middle school in my city a few years ago a bunch of Blacks attacked White students.  This school is in a White neighborhood too.  You would have thought that the parents of the White kids would have at least attempted to do something.  No.  They did nothing but grovel.  Ditto for the police in calling it a hate crime.  They never did call it a hate crime.  How long are we going to wait before we stand up and do something?  Are we going to wait till it gets like South Africa where White people are bludgeoned and murdered?  Oh wait a minute;  we&rsquo;re already being bludgeoned and murdered - and raped, and mugged, and driven out of our neighborhoods, and called racists, and &hellip;</p>

		<p>First off, that mother is CLUELESS.  Her daughter back in school a couple of days later.  Pleeeeze.  I would have been on camera crying lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits.  No thigs would do that to my daughter and go without severe financial penalties.  And that (obviously liberal, social justice-y teacher) I guarantee you she will defend the black girls and talk about pent up rage against white priviledge.  Where I&rsquo;m at, the latinos and blacks do not mix at all.  It&rsquo;s like a big cold war going on, that sometimes erupts in big-time violence.  Blacks need to understand that latinos have no love for them, and when they take over, the welfare and coddling will stop.</p>

		<p>Diversity is our Greatest Strength.  Each race brings something to the table.  Each race brings forward new ideas and new ways of doing things.  We all benefit from the rich cultural exchange from a Diverse classroom.  </p>
<p>Also, of course, there is no such thing as race.  Race is a social construct.  We are all the same   &mdash;   the human race.  However, we should Celebrate Diversity.</p>

		<p>That white teacher looks to be about 5 feet tall and 100 lbs; she&rsquo;s lucky she wasn&rsquo;t seriously injured by the enormous black girls.  What is she doing teaching in that ghetto disaster of a &#8220;school&#8221;?  How much science does she think her &#8220;students&#8221; can possibly understand?  </p>
<p>What a waste of time - she&rsquo;d be better off flipping burgers for a living.  At least ghetto customers can comprehend fast food and are genuinely interested in burgers.  <br>

		<p>A friend of mine lives around the corner on Farwell and walks her dog in the area. She was not aware, that according to greatschools.com, that the school is a liberal dream: 58% black, 29% hispanic, 6% asian, and 6% white (0% of whites proficient in either math, science, or reading on required grade 11 state exam).  This occurred in biology, a science field where only 9% of the 11th graders were proficient in 2010.</p>
<p>These kind of incidents should not be handled internally. Somebody should not have had to leak the video to NBC5. There should be ZERO tolerance. The children should be arrested and taken away, and expelled - not suspended. </p>
<p>Biology is generally a 10th grade class. Why is a 14yo in the same class with a 17yo and an 18yo? So you end up with a  situation where an at least average intelligence 14yo is being tossed around by 2 larger and much older FUNCTIONAL RETARDS who probably should not be in a regular school in the first place   &mdash;   but god forbid we hurt their feelings. </p>

		<p>I see nothing wrong here.  I&rsquo;ve seen this many times before.  These young students are carrying on a spirited disagreement over laboratory procedures.  The African-American scholars were asserting that chloroplasts are held in the cell membranes, while the other young lady held a dissenting opinion.  They were resolving their differences through a process of African-American scientific inquiry.</p>

		<p>Once again the MSM refuses to call this what it is. Starting with &#8220;Girl on girl attack captured on video&#8221;, this would imply TWO individuals of equal footing involved. Fact is, this was an 18 y/o YOUNG ADULT AND A 17 y/o teaming to pummel a 14 y/o girl. Stating it as anything less is an out and out lie. I am always amazed at the age differences between blacks and all others in the schools. The physical differennce between them and the other races are absolutely scary.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned here before but bears repeating; do not allow your children to go to public schools!</p>

<p>Very good observation. When I attended college the double-speak was so common it was almost the norm. The diversitoids have ruled unchallenged for so long they usually embarrass themselves. If more people weren&rsquo;t afraid of them they would be more likely to notice. </p>

		<p>Let me clear this up for you as I was there. The teacher is asian first off. Second, she did nothing but defend Jillian. So no she did not go on about any &#8220;pent up rage against the white priviledge&#8221;. As for the mother, you need to understand that sometimes the needs to be in charge of their own lives. The mother has done everything up to this point to make sure the necessary actions are taken.</p>

		<p>Because the public schools are so afraid of law suits, many such schools have strict policies requiring teachers to not interfere with fights in the classroom, such as displayed in this video. This teacher made a halfhearted attempt to stop the assault, but will likely face disciplinary action for her feeble efforts. Teachers today are instructed to hit a &#8220;panic&#8221; button and wait for security. The students are now in charge of the classroom and they know it. Your son or daughter has no more chance of getting an education in one of these schools than if they were in prison; and are probably less safe than they would be in a state penitentiary. These public schools are virtual war zones now. </p>

		<p>I used to disagree with tuition vouchers, but you know what, why not do it. Give the parents a menu of choices and 75% of the real cost of a public school education. &#8220;Accredited&#8221; schools will start popping up in bad neighborhoods at prices that allow the &#8220;parents&#8221; to keep half the money. Give them what they want as right now taxes for public schools are double taxation in many areas as no sane people let their children go to public schools. Let them all go to schools to be &#8220;commended&#8221; like Urban Prep of Chicago where the average ACT score is 16-17 and all of the FUNCTIONAL RETARDS at the school are offered college scholarships. Would a WHITE kid with a 17 ACT ever get a scholarship based on scholarly ability?</p>
<p>Let them build their separate grifting social structure and force them to use it by ridding the world of public schools.</p>

		<p>Not sure that the teacher is white: she could be Asian. Many Asians are very light skinned. She is very small and has straight black hair too. </p>
<p>Frankly, after watching it twice, if I had to guess, I would guess she&rsquo;s Asian, not white.  Even if we knew her last name we couldn&rsquo;t be sure since she could have been adopted, be Eurasian, or be married to a white guy. </p>
<p>Either way, the fact that blacks mature years before whites (and Asians), allows them to dominate our kids for years, traumatizing them, and perhaps scarring them (emotionally even if not physically), for life. </p>

		<p>Watching this video should be MANDATORY for every college student majoring in education. Maybe then they&rsquo;d get an idea of what teaching is REALLY like. This is EXACTLY what drove me out of teaching for the Philadelphia public school system. At least here the girls are using fists. In my experience, they swing bricks wrapped in doo rags, pull shivs made from sharpened toothbrushes or 6 inch rulers out of their dreads, and use their &#8220;grills&#8221; to bite large holes in their opponents. Anyone even contemplating a teaching career today MUST be certifiable.</p>

		<p>  They don&rsquo;t really say what started the fight. Maybe, it was a scientific argument over the &#8220;chloroplasts&#8221; as Jay Santos sarcastically conjectures? I&rsquo;m sure that most idiot liberals would like to believe that. Then again, maybe Jillian Salgado was a little too light-skinned for her attackers. Perhaps, she was attracting the attention of the other black male students, attention that the jealous &#8220;Sisters&#8221; thought should be focused on them?  </p>

		<p>These creatures do NOT belong in this society. Lincoln was right. They are incapable of adjusting to civilization. They need to be removed and sent back to Africa where they can join their Black brothers in their self extermination.<br>
We have supported them for too long; wasting billions on them appointing them to positions haven&rsquo;t for which they aren&rsquo;t qualified and bestowing degrees on them that they haven&rsquo;t earned and the return on the investment comes in the form of our blood.<br>
Give every Black ten Grand in cash and put them on military transports back to Africa. This would be an investment that would pay huge dividends in security and peace of mind.</p>

		<p>The teacher in the video could have stayed on top of the student being beaten up to protect her but she was almost too small to do even that. She looks to the other black students to break up this fight. Who says attitudes aren&rsquo;t a social-construct, or are socially conditioned at least? I doubt her conditioning has been much altered, no doubt she still believes diversity is our great strength, now more than ever, but I bet even this teacher&rsquo;s nerves will be edgy in certain situations.  </p>

<p>Absolutely true.  </p>
<p>I know a White man who was denied tenure because he saved a black girl from being raped by a black boy.<br>
He was in his second year of teaching.  He needed 3 years to get tenure.  He parked his car in the teacher&rsquo;s lot one morning.</p>
<p>He heard a girl&rsquo;s voice &#8220;Mr. Frank, Mr. Frank help me.&#8221;  Under the hedge he found a black girl on her back with a black boy on top of her tearing off her bra.  The blouse was already torn off.</p>
<p>He grabbed the boy and bounced him off a wall.  The incident was of course reported to the school police who are uniformed peace officers equal to the regular city police and highway patrol.</p>
<p>The boy was back in school in a couple days.  </p>
<p>When the school year ended the White male teacher was told he wouldn&rsquo;t get a contract for next year because of his uncontrolled anger problems. </p>
<p>He lost his job because he did not stand by and let the girl be raped by a black thug who should not be in school. It was black women principal and vice principals who made the decision.  It was an all female, mostly black tenure board that upheld the decision that he not be re hired and allowed to proceed to tenure.</p>
<p>And the feminazis say they are against rape.  Not if the rapists are black men apparently.</p>
<p>In my district, we are told to keep our fingernails very short because even an accidental scratch could lead to reverends and welfare mammas marching on the school.  Of course we are not allowed to touch the kids at all.  We are always told, both men and women to never be alone with less than 3 kids.</p>
<p>1 kid or 2 kids can make up a lie about a White teacher and stick with it.  But when 3 kids make up a lie about a White teacher the story will fall apart when they are questioned separately. <br>

		<p><i>Then again, maybe Jillian Salgado was a little too light-skinned for her attackers. Perhaps, she was attracting the attention of the other black male students, attention that the jealous &ldquo;Sisters&rdquo; thought should be focused on them.</i></p>

You could very well be right. Many a female fight are over a man.  The men enjoy this.</p>
<p>And they intensely resent any female who&rsquo;s lighter than they are. I know a &#8220;black&#8221; woman who&rsquo;s actually 3/4 white.  She&rsquo;s very light skinned. She has told me that when she was in school she had to fight nearly every day because of the black girls who resented her.</p>
<p>But oddly, she hates white women just as much as the black women hate her! </p>

		<p>What is an 18 year old doing in the same class as a 14 year old? I was in grade 9 when I was 14 and in grade 12 when I was 18.</p>

		<p>Time to admit hypocrisy among some AmRen commentators. Now, the attacked girl is White. Fine.<br>
BUT, in other instances you&rsquo;d have denounced Jillian Salgado as a non- White Hispanic. </p>

<p>Why not simply send in a diversity multicult sensitivity indoctrinator to inform these young ladies that &#8220;race is just a construct?&#8221; </p>

<p>Hate can be caused by any of a number of things.  I&rsquo;m not a psychologist, but I&rsquo;m willing to wager her hatred of White women is no doubt motivated by a subconscious desire to be like them.  5/6 of blacks have IQs below 100 and are therefore too stupid to be self-reflective.  </p>
<p>Your friend, being 3/4 White, probably has an IQ above 100 and is therefore intelligent enough to realize (at least on a subconscious level) her White forebears sinned greatly in mixing with inferior black blood.  She must bear the consequences of their folly!  She is forever denied the racial membership she secretly craves, which breeds resentment.  Hence, her &#8220;hatred&#8221; of White women, which is really sour grapes.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m making this up!  I&rsquo;ve lost count of all the black Latinos (male and female) I&rsquo;ve met who tell me with a straight face &#8220;I ain&rsquo;t black!&#8221;  Nobody likes blacks; even blacks dislike other blacks.</p>

		<p>A 14-year-old child is attacked by two refrigerator-sized women several years older, and her own mother claims she didn&rsquo;t know how savage the beating was? Any REAL mother would have her daughter OUT of that school in a heartbeat, and a lawsuit of mammoth proportions already in the works. (Actually, the girl should never have been in a school like that in the first place, but clueless parents abound.) <br>
The MSM tries to keep these stories out of the news for a reason. Every time one gets out, the government-run indoctrination centers stand a chance of losing one or two more potential victims to the safety of home-schooling or private schools. White or even mostly white children should never be subjected to thirteen years of utter hell for the sake of a third-class education. <br>
The next time your child says she doesn&rsquo;t want to go to school because some others pick on her, LISTEN TO HER. THIS may be what is actually happening to her on a smaller but very real scale.</p>

<p>I think you have it analzzed very well. Sour grapes indeed!</p>
<p>All her life she has had to fight to be accepted as &#8220;black&#8221;   &mdash;   which is really impossible to do  (since she&rsquo;s not).  On the other hand,  she resents lighter or white women just as much as the blacks hate her.</p>
<p>I have long noticed that virtually all black women can&rsquo;t stand any other female who&rsquo;s lighter, thinner, or priettier than they are.  This seems to be a universal rule. A great deal has to do with competition for men  (who go for the lighter or whiter chicks   &mdash;    this infuriates the black women).</p>
<p>On the other hand, they can tolerate another woman who&rsquo;s older, heavier, or darker. Those are no competition. Those  make them look good by comparison.  <br>

		<p>I was the only Freshman in my Biology class in Livingston, TX in &#8216;84.  I also had to take Advanced Physical Science that year.  Biology was my elective so I could get through all the sciences offered by my senior year. </p>
<p>Although there were students all the way up to Seniors in this class, I had no fear.  No reason to.  The racial make-up of the class was all white.  They actually respected me for setting high goals.</p>
<p>This 14 year old girl could have been in a similar situation as far as just trying to excel.  Good enough reason as any to whoop her ass, I guess.</p>
<p>This is why my daughter will never set foot in a public school.  Christian school only.</p>
