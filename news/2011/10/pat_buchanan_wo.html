<h1><a href="https://mediamatters.org/blog/201110210018">Pat Buchanan Won&rsquo;t Disavow Idea That Minorities Have Inferior Genes</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eric Hananoki, Media Matters, October 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Yesterday, radio host Thom Hartmann challenged guest Pat Buchanan over his recent writing about minorities and test scores. Hartmann said that &#8220;a lot of people are taking what you&rsquo;re saying as code for inferior genes&#8221; and twice pressed Buchanan to disavow that theory. Buchanan did not, instead claiming that he doesn&rsquo;t &#8220;know anything&#8221; about the topic.</p>
<p>From The Thom Hartmann Program:</p>
<blockquote>HARTMANN: A lot of people are taking what you&rsquo;re saying as code for inferior genes. Please tell me that&rsquo;s not what you&rsquo;re talking about.
BUCHANAN: Well look, I&rsquo;m not  &mdash;  don&rsquo;t know anything about what genetics or something like that. What I&rsquo;m saying is, is these are the test scores and we haven&rsquo;t been able to  &mdash;  
<p>HARTMANN: So do you disavow that?</p>
<p>BUCHANAN: Pardon?</p>
<p>HARTMANN: Do you disavow that idea, that concept  &mdash;  </p>
<p>BUCHANAN: Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything about being  &mdash;  look. The Coleman Report  &mdash;  </p>
<p>HARTMANN: I mean, you&rsquo;re being quoted over on  &mdash;  </p>
<p>BUCHANAN: The Coleman Report, and I think I&rsquo;ve got in my book, the Coleman Report said what a child brings to school is far more important than what he finds in schools, in other words, heredity and home environment, nature and nurture. Do I know the differences, or what percentages, or this and that, of course not. I&rsquo;m not going to get into that. I&rsquo;m saying is here&rsquo;s the test scores now, and this is the problem, and in our future, quite frankly, Hispanic Americans, and African Americans, because of test scores, because of the dropout rate is fifty percent, they&rsquo;re going to be in the service economy and the rest of us are going to be up there in the knowledge industry and that doesn&rsquo;t make for a united America.</blockquote></p>

<p>[The remarks above begin roughly 4:20 into this clip]</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p><em>The Boston Globe</em> reported in a January 1992 article that as a White House aide, Buchanan &#8220;suggested in a memo to President Nixon that efforts to integrate the U.S. might only result in &#8216;perpetual friction&rsquo; because blacks and the poor may be genetically inferior to middle-class whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of the report, Buchanan was running for president and under criticism for his history of controversial racial statements. <em>The Globe</em> reported that &#8220;Buchanan said yesterday he does not believe blacks are genetically inferior to whites and did not have that belief in the past. Buchanan said he sent the memo to Nixon as a routine matter of intellectual curiosity.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>The Globe</em> wrote of Buchanan&rsquo;s memo:</p>
<blockquote>The memo to Nixon was prompted by the September 1971 issue of The Atlantic, in which author Richard Herrnstein argued that the devotion of government resources to compensatory education and other anti-poverty programs would not result in a more equitable society. The more that government removed social barriers, Herrnstein wrote, the more that genetically blessed individuals would rise to the top of a caste system based on merit.
<p>&#8220;Basically, it demonstrates that heredity, rather than environment, determines intelligence  &mdash;  and that the more we proceed to provide everyone with a &#8216;good environment,&rsquo; surely the more heredity will become the dominant factor  &mdash;  in their intelligence, and thus in their success and social standing,&#8221; Buchanan wrote to Nixon. &#8221; It is almost the iron law of intelligence that is being propounded here  &mdash;  based on heredity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The importance of this article is difficult to understate. If correct, then all our efforts and expenditures not only for &#8216;compensatory education&rsquo; but to provide an &#8216;equal chance at the starting line&rsquo; are guaranteeing that we wind up with the intelligent ones coming in first. And every study we have shows blacks 15 IQ points below whites on the average.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buchanan also warned Nixon that, as Herrnstein noted, the ultimate conclusion of the thesis  &mdash;  that some groups or races are inherently superior to others  &mdash;  carried &#8220;rather frightful&#8221; political implications.</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Buchanan wrote in his book:</p>
<blockquote>In 1971, the Atlantic Monthly ran a cover article by Harvard&rsquo;s Richard Herrnstein. His thesis was that even if we are able to equalize the home and school environment of all children, natural academic ability will enable some children to outperform others. No matter how much money is invested in reducing class size and enhancing teacher training, an &#8220;hereditary meritocracy&#8221; will arise in a public school system where expenditures are equal.
<p>Coleman and Herrnstein were teaching predestination in education. They were implying that the national effort just launched to raise the test scores of minority children to parity with the scores of white children was an experiment noble in purpose but doomed to fail. But pessimism about the ability of government to succeed in its ambitions was not in vogue when government was being hailed as architect and builder of the Great Society.</p>
<p>America plunged forward. U.S. and state governments and local school districts began the most massive investment in education in all of history. Expenditures per pupil doubled and tripled. Head Start, a preschool program for low-income children established in 1965, was lavishly funded. Perhaps $200 billion was poured into Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which provided additional funds to schools based on their population of low-income students.</p>
<p>What were the results? Writes Murray, &#8220;no evaluation from Title I from the 1970s onward has found credible evidence of a significant positive impact on student achievement &hellip; . A 2001 study by the Department of Education revealed that the gap widened rather than diminished.&#8221;</p>
<p>George W. Bush attacked the disparity between majority and minority school achievement anew with his No Child Left Behind law. The Department of Education budget doubled again. What was accomplished? Judging by test scores, writes Murray, &#8220;NCLB has done nothing to raise reading skills despite the enormous effort that has been expended.&#8221; [pp. 214-215]</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Near the conclusion of his section on race and education, on page 224, Buchanan quotes the writing of white supremacist Sam Francis, in which Francis writes that &#8220;the doctrine of equality is unimportant, because no one save perhaps Pol Pot and Ben Wattenberg really believes in it, and no one, least of all those who profess it most loudly, is seriously motivated by it &hellip; . The real meaning of the doctrine of equality is that it serves as a political weapon.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It seems the multiculturalists depend on emotion, rather than reason, to make their case. The create the myth of racism and make it moral dilemma to &lsquo;sin&rsquo; against diversity.</p>
<p>Rational, logical thinking is trumped by White guilt.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never seen an &lsquo;anti-racist&rsquo; Hollywood production that applied reason. Rather, they always make an emotional appeal.</p>

		<p>This is totally irrelevant to the race-replacement issue..100 percent. And what Pat Buchanan has done is sidetrack the discussion away from race-replacment at the hand of post-1965 nonwhites. And people wonder why I go after the HBD crowd. Think of all the other things he could be talking about such as the obvious fact that post-1965 Asians in our America are 1)  major threat to America&rsquo;s wildlife and 2) that Asians in our America our waging a vcious race war againast the Native Born White American Majority.</p>

		<p>In the past week, several high &amp; mighty AR posters criticized PB because he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;pure&#8221; enough. Oh, my, he could have said this &amp; he could have said that. But for 40 years, PB has publicly defended Western culture to millions, while some AR jokers wish he was &#8220;perfect.&#8221; Now he is under siege. Will we defend our patriotic friend, or will we nitpick his heroism and abandon him to the jackals?   </p>

<p>Now they are attacking my hero, Sam Francis, a dead man. </p>
<p>Sam was right on everything he ever wrote and the neocons had fits. I believe it was William Buckley (correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong) that had Sam fired and Sam died a pauper thanks to the &#8220;conservatives&#8221; who are so very PC when it comes to race. I have come to detest the conservative Party as much as I do the lefty Party. They are one and the same when it comes to the genocide of the White populations.</p>

		<p>This is &#8220;The Emperor&rsquo;s New Brain&#8221; story that has been playing out in America for almost 50 years.</p>
<p>It has gotten to the point that in a conversation, if race is brought up and intelligence is discussed, I make the matter-of-fact comment that since blacks have a one-standard deviation lower IQ than whites - averaging 85 or so - along with genetically poor impulse control and reasoning skills, that&rsquo;s why we (and blacks in a western society) have so many racial problems.</p>
<p>At first some people are stunned but since it&rsquo;s true - and they know it to be true - it helps plant the seed for a larger acceptance of the truth. </p>
<p>There are more than enough studies to back me up and I quote them. I explain that hey, I didn&rsquo;t create evolution, and I&rsquo;m not advocating anything ugly, I&rsquo;m just really stating the obvious. If they don&rsquo;t like it, too bad. I also advocate for whites (civilization) at the same time and implore them to do the same.</p>
<p>Everyone must speak up. Be calm, articulate, and unbending. You&rsquo;d be surprised at the new friends you might make. You might lose some friends but when things get really bad I suspect they&rsquo;ll be back in your corner.</p>

		<p>I used to be like Buchanan, I didn&rsquo;t want to come right out and say it&hellip;.BLACKS HAVE LOWER IQS AND THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE!</p>
<p>However, after becoming educated on the subject, I know that it is true.  The data says it and all my personal experiences confirm it.   We are not all the same and therefore not all equal.  There are blacks out there with an IQ of 120 but 85 is the average.  A black with an IQ of 120 is akin to a white superstar in the NBA.  </p>
<p>I have a fantasy.  In my fantasy I am a god and can push a button and make all races disapear except for blacks.  I would love to push that button and come back to earth 1 month later, 6 months later to see how blacks are doing.  Then come back 6 every months thereafter so check on them.  I think every big city containing large amounts of blacks would be destroyed in the first year, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any electricity, people would be starving, rape, murder and robbery would be rampant.   </p>
<p>I would like to do that for each race to see how each does on their own.  Sounds crazy&hellip;.I know but I think that would be a  very instructive study.  </p>

		<p>Having successfully expunged racial references from White dialog, leftists are going a step further. They now seek opportunities to accuse White people of using racist &#8216;codes&rsquo; in their conversation. </p>
<p>Hartmann accuses Buchanan of using a &#8216;code&rsquo; for &#8216;inferior genes&rsquo; when the acknowledges ethnic disparity in education. </p>
<p>Other times White people are accused of using a racist &#8216;code&rsquo; when they refer to Obama as a &#8216;socialist&rsquo;. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ongoing effort to purge honesty, realism and practical solutions from our culture. </p>

		<p>When &lsquo;political correctness&rsquo; is the ruling ethical framework, you only have two choices when talking about race and intelligence.</p>
<p>1.To sell your soul and dishonestly speak only the words of &lsquo;the party line&rsquo; and try to make all conclusions fit into the accepted narrative. <br>
=Lose/Win.</p>
<p>2. To speak the truth and be ostracized. <br>
=Win/Lose.   </p>
<p>There is no Win/Win scenario.</p>
<p>To look at all the completely diverse upright walking, intelligent hominids who walked this earth before, some living in close proximity to us modern humans as recently as 25,000 years ago. <br>
Whose ancestor&rsquo;s gene&rsquo;s, if weren&rsquo;t completely wiped out and made extinct, have experienced introgressive hybridization in the broader Homo sapien gene pool.<br>
Such as with Homo erectus in Asia and Neanderthals in Europe or the Denisova hominin DNA which has been found in Melanesians (Papuan peoples from the New Guinea region) and Australian Aborigines.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introgression" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introgression</a> </p>
<p>Then to say that all these differing strains of homo sapiens who after 10,000&rsquo;s to 100,000&rsquo;s of years of completely separate evolution, now have the exact same intellectual potential is a vast over simplification and wishful thinking at best.</p>
<p>It appears that celebrating or preserving &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; has never been the real goal (although diversity is apparently &ldquo;a strength&rdquo;) of the multiculturalists.</p>
<p>Suppressing free speech on open dialog just long enough for &lsquo;true diversity&rsquo; to be eliminated, to be replaced with this new uni-cultural (one race) human race who are more easily controlled with their newly lowered median IQ (this may not be the engineered goal per se) but it is going to be the outcome. </p>
<p>As much as this may sound like an outline for a paranoid science fiction story, &lsquo;Genetic socialism&rsquo; (a phrase coined by another poster) is the multiculturalists&rsquo; end game outcome, when we&rsquo;re  repeatedly denied the opportunity to explore inconvenient truths such as these.  </p>

		<p>It is interesting that lower intelligence is taken to mean inferiority.</p>
<p>The United States is an African-American country. Their culture is dominant, they control the major cities, and they get preference in hiring.</p>
<p>So in what way are they inferior?<br>

		<p>Notice there was nothing in this piece about whether Buchanan was actually wrong about anything he said. Just the implication that what he said is terrible and awful and horrible and therefore it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be right! Talk about &#8220;code!&#8221; The libbies are masters of it.</p>
<p>Also, notice that it&rsquo;s the libbies who are labeling genes as &#8220;inferior&#8221; or &#8220;superior&#8221;  &mdash;  not simply as having different characteristics. It&rsquo;s their words, not Buchanan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>And, of course, the issue of whether there actually <i>are</i> racial differences in intelligence has already been &#8220;settled&#8221; long ago. Racial differences in intelligence are like a philosophical &#8220;nuclear bomb&#8221; - a subject that&rsquo;s too dangerous to even discuss. So we rush headlong into making ourselves a minority, so if it ever is discussed, it will be too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>And all this while claiming to believe in &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; and &#8220;democracy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Actually it would be very interesting to ask the <i>negation</i> of that question to some of our PC adversaries, like Tim Wise or maybe the &#8220;Anti-Fa&#8221; movement in Europe.</p>
<p>I would ask something like, &#8220;Mr. Wise, will go on record agreeing with the idea that human intellectual potential either has no genetic component, or if it does have a genetic component, that component does not vary across any racial groups?  In other words, either there&rsquo;s no genetic factor(s) in IQ, or if there are genetic factor(s), these are distributed evenly, so an African pygmy and an Ashkenazi Jew have, on average, the exact same potential for IQ and intellectual achievement, and any differences in observed intellectual achievement must be due to external factors such as perhaps education, childhood nutrition, harmful effects of racism, or cultural differences?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, if Mr. Wise would go on record for that, the next question would be, &#8220;If, at some later time, this is proven to be false, would you also agree that we should abandon programs such as affirmative action, welfare for single moms, etc, which all only make sense if, indeed, there are no differences in innate potential between the races?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what I would like to ask.</p>
<p>Whoever agrees with my statement there should spend a month trying to teach blacks something.</p>

		<p>Poor Pat, in hot water once again for simply saying, however circumspectly, what everybody knows to be true.</p>
<p>Official (that&rsquo;s to say state-sponsored) denial of self-evident truth is a mark of tyranny, the very sort of tyranny which killed 40 million Russians in the Twenties and Thirties, at least 60 million Chinese in the Fifties, and four million Cambodians (two-thirds of them) in the Seventies.</p>
<p>Hire an incorrect number of unqualified minorities and you can be fined out of existence if you&rsquo;re a small business, at best tormented and harassed, forced to incur huge legal fees to defend yourself against almost absurdly baseless charges.</p>

		<p>Mr Buchanan will never come out and say he believes the lower average IQ of blacks has a genetic basis but he is always dropping hints that he believes it to be so. To his defence, he wrote a column defending James Watson after the thought police went after him for his heretical remarks about african intelligence back in 2007. Name of the article was &#8220;the recantation of Dr. Watson&#8221; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve often wondered why Buchanan wasn&rsquo;t tarred and feathered long ago. There have been plenty who have been destroyed for saying far less. Better late than never though. The weasels in the media seem to be primed for an all out attack on him. </p>
<p>The one topic that sits atop the pc brigade&rsquo;s most protected list is the intelligence of minorities, specifically blacks. And especially when compared to Whites. To even hint that any non White isnt on a par with Whites as far as intelligence goes, is to invite total ruination. To me, there is no room for debate on this subject. The evidence is so overwhelming as to make any argument against the different races having different levels of intelligence on average, seem ridiculous. Yet here we are in 2011, still pretending that a race that lives in grass huts with dirt floors, mutilates the genitals of little girls and starves to death, is on a par with a race that invented space travel and visited the moon.  </p>
<p>If Buchanan sticks to his guns and tells the media to shove it, it would go a long way towards ending this insanity of groveling and begging forgiveness for speaking the truth. IMO, all it would take is for one high profile person to have the cajonies to stand his ground and refuse the left&rsquo;s demand for groveling and begging, which NEVER, EVER helps anyway, to start an avalanche of like minded behavior. This would be a huge leap in the &#8220;comeback&#8221; of White people everywhere. </p>

		<p>This is just like all the criticism people get for pointing out that IQ test score averages for Asians are above IQ test score averages for Hispanics.  Isn&rsquo;t it?  Because isn&rsquo;t that equally the case?</p>
<p>You can argue the tests are flawed, or are measuring something other than what they appear, but you can&rsquo;t argue the results.  I think it&rsquo;s important to argue that tests can be improved and variables need to be eliminated.  That&rsquo;s what makes for better science.  But arguing the results are uncomfortable doesn&rsquo;t make for better science.</p>

This whole foolishness is soon coming to an end as this country is broke and the whites are steadily becoming the minority.  How sad that the whites in charge are absolutely refusing to change from this foolish path of making the whites the minority and shifting money and resources away from whites but instead throwing it into an endless pit of inferiority.  The destruction of a great country came from within instead of the reverse.  How unbelievable.     </p>

		<p>WHITES AND ASIANS ARE THE RESULT OF EVOLVUTIONARY PRESSURES<br>
IN COLDER CLIMATES!!!</p>
<p>When ancestors of whites and Asians left the Great Rift Valley Of East Africa a hundred thousand years ago, their skin lightened. But something else happened: evolutionary pressure caused the least intelligent amongst them to DIE! The least intelligent among them could not plan crops and thus survive variable climates and periodic famines. The lazy them did not reproduce. Those who were not inventive and did not invent new technology coulod not pass along their genes.</p>
<p>Blacks living in the tropics did not experience these evolutionary pressures. They merely had to reach up and pull a cocoanut from a tree. There was no selection for intelligence.<br>
Therefore, black IQ levels 20 points below those of whites and Asians. Is this so strange?</p>
<p>Blacks cannot compete in a capitalist society. Socialism and the welfare state replicates the life they had in Africa, where nature&rsquo;s bounty was dumped into their laps. </p>

		<p>Maybe Pat would do better if he broadened his discussion and pointed out that just as Blacks do less well than Whites on IQ tests, so do Whites do less well that Orientals and Jews.  Being free to compete for admissions, Jews have come to dominate Ivy League schools and Orientals those on the West Coast, with Whites being replaced with superior performers from above and affirmative action placements from below.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think a lot of my fellow White people will like it being pointed out that we are not the brightest bulbs in box, and that may have something to do with how we made out in the Culture War that lost White America.</p>
<p>For the Liberals who reject nature for all nurture, the only explanation for Black performance is then having grown up in Black Culture.  So until it is dismantled, it will continue to produce a poorly performing product.  Sounds like a nice project for Liberal social engineering.

		<p>  The modern secular state religion of egalitarianism demands affirmative fealty.  Even agnosticism is not allowed. If you&rsquo;re not an active &#8220;church goer&#8221; you are apriori a heathen/pagan, and at best, outside of respectable company, to be converted, by force if necessary, for you own good.</p>
<p>   &#8220;(the host) twice pressed Buchanan to disavow that theory (blacks have inferior genes).&#8221;</p>
<p>Buchanan protested that he did not know enough to comment on this. In ordinary life only a fool would comment on something he claims to be ignorant of, but this was not good enough for the host.  Egalitarianism is an article of FAITH.  You must believe it regardless of any evidence pro or con. Belief is proof that you are a &#8220;good person&#8221; underneath.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does happen. Egypt is a good historical case in point. Modern Egyptians, who seem to be thoroughly mixed with sub-Saharan Africans, are nowhere as creative, historically important or civilized as their ancient counterpoints.  Whites have been replaced in Zimbabwe, and are currently being replaced in South Africa. Some would say that California is no longer the prosperous, safe and happy state it once was due to the massive inflow of mestizos, Cholos, Indios and mulattos from the Third World. </p>

		<p>Anyone who believes that there are no differences between blacks and whites other than skin color have probably never had the pleasure of living in an area enriched with diversity.

		<p>Obviously, it is not necessary to emphasize IQ  &mdash;  the fact of the matter is that everything imaginable has been thrown at the<br>
intractable public school  achievement gap between Blacks and Whites, and nothing works on a sustained basis.

<p>Assimilation isn&rsquo;t the issue. That&rsquo;s more of Sailer&rsquo;s &#8220;Citizenship&#8221; nonsense. Nonwhites can never assimilate because they can never assimilate into being  Native Born White American&hellip;and this because they are of a different race. This is the fundamental flaw of Buchanan&rsquo;s new book. By making assimilation the fundamental issue, Buchanan is basically pushing the &#8220;America is a proposition Nation&#8221; nonsense.</p>
<p>It is really appalling to read the comments in this thread for they confirm my point that by engaging in a psychometric debate about  scores on a IQ test&hellip;there is a corresponding sidetracking away from race-replacement issue. If Pat Buchanan focused on the Asians in our America and why they don&rsquo;t belong here..the case against Mexicans becomes incredibly trivial-obvious. So what is Pat going to do now?..lecture Native Born White Americans about their &#8216;scientifically&#8221; established lower intelligence level compared to Asians in America on national TV?</p>
<p>I really find the comments in this thread to be incredibly foolish.  The whole case against race-replacement is being sidetracked and you are all actively participating in it.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s absurd to call non-whites &#8220;minorities&#8221;</p>
<p>Often we hear anti-whites use the term &#8220;minorities&#8221; used to refer to Africans, Indians, Orientals etc&hellip;</p>
<p> This is a strange term because these groups have the largest populations in the world. Africans, Indians and Orientals each have larger population than whites. So why is this this term &#8220;minority&#8221; used as a euphemism for non-whites?</p>
<p> It is used in order to obscure the truth. We whites are not a majority, on a global scale we are a tiny and vanishing minority. Not only are we a global minority but we are poised to become a minority in our own homes.</p>
<p> In 1900 my race, comprised 33% of world population, today we are at 9% and dropping like a rock. Not only are we a minority in the world but because of immigration &amp; assimilation in EVERY white country and ONLY white countries our children are poised to be minorities IN OUR OWN COUNTRIES within a few decades.</p>

		<p>Hey HARTMANN, minority test scores keep falling and crime keeps rising. Drop-out rates, teen pregnancy and single motherhood are on the rise. They&rsquo;re not getting better, they&rsquo;re getting worse. They have every advantage with affirmative action program, free schools, free tuition, etc. They have had these advantages for 40 years and they keep getting worse. Conditions in the black community were actually better during segregation. Single motherhood and violent crime has skyrocketed since &#8220;civil rights&#8221; programs were enacted.  These programs are destroying this country and they should be abolished. Any student of any race should be allowed to study if they really want to. They should be allowed to compete for a job or school that interests them.  If a black student scores a higher grade on a test than any other, that student should receive the scholarship or position. If they score low, the position should be given to the more qualified candidate. Giving scholarships to students who can barely read is a horrible mistake. Schooling children and teens who would rather be committing crimes is  an awful waste.  If you want to bully other children, attack teachers, etc, you should be pushing a broom in a prison yard, not going to school.</p>
<p>I believe life in general would be better for minorities if they actually had to work and compete for advancement. Handouts and entitlements are making life worse for them&hellip;as well as for us.</p>

<p>Indians are not high achieving. In fact, they are much worse than most of non-white Caucasoids. Average IQ of Indian subcontinent oscillates around 85, probably lower. </p>
<p>Some Crème de la crème exceptions are not representative and does not change the fact. If they were &#8220;high achieving&#8221;, they should have been very successful at the university I&rsquo;m enrolled at, unfortunately your Chinese cousins (I know, they are yellow but geographically &#8220;Asian&#8221;) even outperform Germans despite their enormous incapabilities of German language.

<p>I agree with you that race replacement, which is White Genocide, is the issue, and that the anti-Whites who are carrying out the program of White Genocide are not about to let anyone talk about the issue of White Genocide on TV!</p>
<p>But since anti-Whites have succeeded in making whites think that race is not a meaningful category, which leaves whites in a sorry state to develop racial consciousness and to have any concern about their race at all, discussion of IQ differences might be a useful first step in teaching whites that race is meaningful.</p>

<p>That was started by Bob&rsquo;s Underground Graduate Seminar (B.U.G.S.) Fighting White Genocide.</p>
<p>Bob was formerly a psychological warrior for the gov&rsquo;t, and he and his bugsters want to overthrow the hegemony of the r-word by making the phrases &#8220;anti-White,&#8221; &#8220;pro-White,&#8221; and &#8220;White Genocide&#8221; part of the everyday lexicon of Whites.</p>
<p>They understand what the advertising industry views as axiomatic: the power of a consistent simple message delivered repeatedly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s something the pro-White movement in general hasn&rsquo;t understood, but our enemies have. Our enemies&rsquo; consistent message is the r-word. If you speak any random racial truth to a random group of whites today, almost every mind among them immediately fills with the r-word and all its baggage.

		<p>&#8220;As for Buchanan (and many others), I suppose they are trying to avoid the poisonous and forbidden topic of &ldquo;race&rdquo; by focusing on IQ instead. I do not agree with him. But that&rsquo;s the price he must pay to stay on television. Yes, it is weasely, but even out best spokesmen are reduced to that.&#8221; GHW<br>

 Correct, we have to be more political realists on this site. The Mainstream Media will never allow an avowed &#8220;racist&#8221; access to the Media, other than for ridicule. Pat realizes he walks a fine line and has to stop short of talking like Jared Taylor. If he talks in terms of assimilation, it&rsquo;s because that&rsquo;s what is political expedient at the moment. I say anyone who advances even part of our agenda should get our support. I believe that Pat is closer to our views than another mainstream political commentator. An old man himself, he realizes that time is running out for whites in this country. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Believe it or not there has never been more Whites in the world than now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, and this is why so much of the fear-mongering on white nationalist sites about the &#8220;genocide&#8221; of the white race has no basis in reality.  As long as miscegenation is low, which it basically is, and whites continue to stay out of fraticidal  wars, as they have for 65 years now, there is no evidence of our demise.  In fact, living among other races does more than anything to instill racial consciousness among whites, which is what we say we want.  Look which part of the USA has had the most racial consciousness in our history: the South, were whites had to share the land with non-whites.  Look were historically was the least racial consciousnesss and solidarity: the states in which basically everyone is white.  </p>
<p>We ought to focus less on the imminent demise of our race, and more on improving the QUALITY of our race by focusing on eugenic health and the restoration of cultural pride and spiritual excellence.  None of which requires &#8220;separatism&#8221; or &#8220;supremacy&#8221; over other races.  The wrong white people are the one&rsquo;s having children.   The more intelligent white men and women, in particular, often end up not having children at all, or only have one child.  </p>
<p>Of course the one thing we have to be able to do is say &#8220;the white race, and all races for that matter, is and are worth preserving.  </p>

		<p> I wrote an interesting article on mate selection on the giavellireport(.com). It questioned whether blacks proclivity towards rape didn&rsquo;t select for violent bad mates, whereas europanic people carefully chose the mates for child rearing. The rape children end up being the least cohesive irresponsible and violent, the well chosen mate children improve with each generation.</p>

&lsquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve always felt similarly about abortionists&hellip; They try to make nicey by calling themselves &ldquo;pro-choice.&rdquo; They should be called &ldquo;PRO-MURDER.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; is the right term, because that is exactly what we are for. It should be a woman&rsquo;s choice whether she wants to continue a pregnancy, not the government&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I understand how an anti-abortion stand is compatible with being pro-White. Do you want to stop blacks and mestizos from getting abortions (I know the Christian Right loves to whine about Planned Parenthood wanting to exterminate blacks because they have clinics in their neighborhoods)? What about White women who&rsquo;ve been raped by a black? Should they be forced to give birth to a rapist&rsquo;s mulatto spawn?&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with your comments regarding rape. There is the risk that the child  will carry the sociopathic genetics of it&rsquo;s &#8220;father&#8221;.<br>
If the rape statistics are correct, we would have 20,000 rape babies born every year. </p>

<p><i>I don&rsquo;t think a lot of my fellow White people will like it being pointed out that we are not the brightest bulbs in box, and that may have something to do with how we made out in the Culture War that lost White America.</i></p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ve written is not true and insulting to white Americans.</p>
<p>Whites are being blatantly discriminated against in university admissions, especially at elite institutions:</p>
<p>&#8220;The data strongly suggest that Jewish overrepresentation at elite universities has nothing to do with IQ but with discrimination against non-Jewish White Americans, especially those from the working class or with rural origins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One might simply suppose that [Jewish overrepresentation] is due to higher Jewish IQ. However, on the basis of Richard Lynn&rsquo;s estimates of Ashkenazi Jewish IQ and correcting for the greater numbers of European Whites, the ratio of non-Jewish Whites to Jews should be around 7 to 1 (IQ &gt;130) or  4.5 to 1 (IQ &gt; 145). Instead, the ratio of non-Jewish Whites to Jews is around 1 to 1 or less.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The concept of &#8220;IQ&#8221; and the assessment of a person&rsquo;s &#8220;wattage&#8221;<br>
did not arise out of the blue with Galton and other researchers<br>
in the late 19th and early 20th century.  There is what Marxists<br>
might term a &#8220;class approach&#8221; to the matter.  At the blue collar<br>
level of semi-skilled and skilled labor, life within the predominantly agrarian society of an earlier America provided one IQ test item after another, and in the full view of co-workers.  Try loading a horse-drawn wagon along the competing dimensions of weight/ off-loading schedules / size and fit / etc.  Try improvising a temporary &#8220;fix&#8221; to broken hand tools or simple farm implements.  There is none of the &#8220;talk a ball game&#8221; latitude of the white-collar  verbal-manipulative levels of society.  Sadly, Blacks were for a long  time, &#8220;livestock&#8221; with a huge sale value.  That hardly presented a motive to make them look dull. That they, on average, were markedly duller than Whites was just a continual before-the-face reality.   During this time, there was among teachers, physicians, and other rural community leaders a nearly universal assumption of the importance of heredity in the shaping of personality.  Close up involvement with horses, dogs,<br>
milk cows, etc., provided a sense of this, and at a time when<br>
rural families quite often had six to ten children, the evidence of the senses regarding the impact of genes was much much clearer and more intimate than in today&rsquo;s media-fed delu-sphere.  So,it appears to be Hartmann, who is doing the disavowing.  The reality-based social consensus  of many many successive decades counts for nothing to him?.  It was all just some subconscious hatred being projected onto Blacks, awaiting<br>
CNN and NYT to clarify!    </p>
