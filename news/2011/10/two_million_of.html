			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Doughty, Daily Mail (London), October 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The number of mixed race people in Britain may be double the official count, say researchers.</p>
<p>The study suggests that there may be as many as two million from a mixed ethnic background instead of just under one million, which was the official estimate made earlier this year.</p>
<p>The new figures mean that children of mixed parents may be one of the biggest ethnic groups in the country, outnumbering those who class themselves as black and much bigger than the largest single non-white grouping  &mdash;  those of Indian origin.</p>
<p>The estimate suggests that racial barriers in Britain are much less important than many have believed, and that integration is a reality for a high proportion of the population.</p>
<p>It also casts a stark new light on the way many children trapped in the state care system have been denied a chance of a new home through adoption because social workers will not allow mixed race adoptions. </p>
<p>The latest estimate was compiled by academics and disclosed by BBC 2&rsquo;s Newsnight yesterday.</p>
<p>They say that while official surveys are based on counts of people who say yes when asked if they are mixed race, more accurate numbers can be produced by asking for the ethnicity of their parents.</p>
<p>This question is thought to produce better answers from those who find the description &#8216;mixed race&rsquo; ugly or offensive.</p>
<p>According to the analysis carried out by Dr Alita Nandi at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, the alternative way of counting mixed-race individuals produces a figure of 1.99 per cent of adults, as opposed to the 0.88 per cent who say they are mixed race when asked directly.</p>
<p>Newsnight added that, based on Office for National Statistics surveys, 2.9 per cent of children are described as mixed race, but 8.9 per cent live with parents who have a different ethnic background. </p>
<p>It said: &#8216;There may be around two million mixed-race people living in the UK  &mdash;  3 per cent of the population and therefore a larger group than any of the defined ethnic minorities.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The BBC also found figures suggesting that those of mixed race are likely to be successful. </p>
<p>It said 73 per cent reach national educational standards at the age of ten, compared with 77 per cent of white children and 65 per cent of black children. </p>
<p>Among mixed white and Asian children, the proportion of ten-year-olds reaching expected standards is 79 per cent, the same as Indian children and higher than the 67 per cent among Pakistani and Bangladeshi children.</p>
<p>The BBC cited examples of successful mixed-race people from showbusiness and sport, including Myleene Klass, Lewis Hamilton, Leona Lewis, Mark Ramprakash, Ryan Giggs and Rio Ferdinand.</p>
<p>The analysis comes in the wake of promises from David Cameron to speed up the adoption system which has blocked the chances of many of the 65,000 children in state care from finding permanent new families. </p>
<p>Social workers stick to a doctrine  &mdash;  unlawful in any other walk of life  &mdash;  that adoptive parents must be of the same ethnic mix as the children they take on. </p>
<p>This has had a major impact with just one baby a week  &mdash;  of any race  &mdash;  getting a new family.</p>

<p>My guess: children who are half white British and half Asian (i.e., Indian, Pakistani, etc.) get counted as white since many of them are indistinguishable from Southern Europeans like Greeks or Sicilians. People think of &#8220;mixed race&#8221; mainly as having partial African ancestry.</p>

<p>Also another important point is that the dead girls parents WANTED the White couple to be found guilty&hellip;Her mother is a black Hindu&hellip;&hellip;they wanted the black killer to be downplayed. See her parents on link below.</p>

<p>Wow&hellip; I had no idea TakiMag was so overtly racial.  I might have to start reading it.<br>

&#8220;According to the analysis carried out by Dr Alita Nandi at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, the alternative way of counting mixed-race individuals produces a figure of 1.99 per cent of adults, as opposed to the 0.88 per cent who say they are mixed race when asked directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Except that if you&rsquo;re asking the ethnic group of someone&rsquo;s parents, and putting them down as &#8220;mixed race&#8221; when they reply &#8216;English and German&rsquo; or &#8216;Chinese and Korean,&rsquo; then you&rsquo;re lying.  No where does it say that she isn&rsquo;t doing this.</p>
<p>This is also the parents that THEY&rsquo;RE LIVING WITH.  Not necessarily their biological parents.  &#8220;Alternate method&#8221; of counting indeed.</p>

		<p>Amanda Knox must cover several unanswered questions during her forthcoming lucrative media deals, and we should not try to read the minds of the bereaved parents of the murder victim.</p>
<p>More relevant to your news item is the explanation in other journals of how these revised statistics were calculated; see e.g. Daily Telegraph (London, October 7), which adds that &#8220;38 per cent of mixed-race children in Britain live in single-parent families&#8221; compared with the (nevertheless deplorable) figure of 23 per cent of all children. This is attributed not to &#8220;weaker relationships&#8221; between couples of different race but &#8220;more likely&#8221; to &#8220;varied attitudes towards family life across the globe&#8221;. Given that 65 per cent of black Caribbean children live with a single parent, this &#8220;explanation&#8221; obscures the tendency of black men to desert their white partners.</p>
<p>A mixed-race columnist Joseph Harker (Guardian, October 5) wrote sarcastically: &#8220;Advertisers use people like me all the time - to show how cool they are, how modern, how cutting-edge.  People like me win world championships, X factor, and even the keys to the White House&#8221;. But he warns young people not to get caught up in the modern fashionable love-in, because &#8220;white people&#8221; find mixed-race people more acceptable than &#8220;black and Asian people&#8221;, and the struggle against racism must continue, outside the bedroom, with black and mixed-race people in alliance.</p>
<p>The Times (October 8) has published a breakdown of world population growth, noting that almost all the increase occurs in non-white regions which are relatively poor. US Defence Dept adviser Prof. Sciubba is quoted on the impact for peace and security, especially from over-urbanisation, and &#8220;frustrated young men scrambling for water, food and jobs&#8221;.  The newspaper runs an editorial, fearing that destitution caused by third world population growth could lead to demands on immigration and even incite &#8220;authoritarian solutions such as compulsory state-birth control&#8221;. It suggests that technology and &#8220;free trade&#8221; should be enough to overome the problems.</p>
<p>One might also note the male surplus in China and elsewhere scrambling for mates. Miscegenation may prove an immigration magnet.</p>
<p>More academically enterprising blog-surfers may care to obtain and reflect on the far-sighted US lecture on future implications of global overpopulation for migration, miscegenation and white extinction, by Prof. William McDougall FRS, published in &#8220;Ethics and Some Modern World Problems&#8221; (London: Methuen, 1925).</p>

I found that to be very odd. Then I decided to find the Kercher&rsquo;s photos and just SEE who they really were. Bingo. </p>

		<p>Mixed race = black only right? </p>
<p>Why are all these Africans moving into white nations anyway? </p>
<p>How may whites are moving into African nations to sponge off them? </p>
<p>Look. This all started over 500 yrs ago with not just the discovery of the western hemisphere but as we al know more importantly the intentional flawed logic and reasoning to go to Africa and buy off the rejects weakling runts and inferiors of the Ham race from the tribal chiefs. </p>
<p>Everything starts as a simple idea. Clearly it appears the very founding of the western hemisphere was an evil idea planted into the Spanish and acted upon and ironically in 1492 the &#8220;jews&#8221; were kicked out of Spain and heading northwest to England as we know where they were kicked out too but then used to go to the west as pilgrims. </p>

<p>No, she is not compelled to answer any sort of &#8220;unanswered question,&#8221; she has already been defended in an appeal and won.  Questions formulated by the yellow press are not questions, but accusations posed as questions, much like your own sneer at her &#8220;lucrative media deals.&#8221;  The Knox Family is about $80,000.00 in debt from this trial alone, and a human being, an American citizen was deprived of 4 important years due to the corruption and medieval nature of the Italian justice system.  Any compensation she and her family can get from the rubbernecking public is great as far as I and most (I would bet) are concerned.</p>

		<p>There are several important questions which this survey leaves unanswered. For example:-</p>
<p>1/Why the discrepancy between the 2.9% who are described by themselves or their parents as mixed race, and the 8.9% found to be actually mixed race or living with parents of different ethnicities?<br>
I suspect that part black children will usually be described simply as black because black is &#8220;cool&#8221;, mixed race is cool too but not as cool as black, white is not cool at all. I also suspect that an Indian or Pakistani father will claim a mixed race child as belonging to his own ethnicity, whereas only white fathers will describe their own children as mixed race.</p>
<p>2/what proportion of that 8.9% is mixed race, and what proportion consists of children of a single ethnicity living in a multi-racial household? We&rsquo;re not told, but based purely on my own experience I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if multi-racial step families were numerous. I know three simply through casual acquaintance - white man with Indian woman and her two Indian children, Indian man with white woman and her two white children, white man with Chinese woman and their adopted mixed race (white/Chinese) son.</p>
<p>3/What proportion of the mixed race children has a white British parent? Again, we&rsquo;re not told, but in such a highly diverse community as modern Britain it is at least likely that in many cases neither parent is white British.</p>
<p><br>
Anyway, whatever the precise proportions, the situation is appalling and the BBC, by running a &#8220;season&#8221; of programs dedicated to celebrating and promoting race mixing has surely signed its own death warrant, execution to be carried out as soon as Britain has a government worthy of her.</p>
