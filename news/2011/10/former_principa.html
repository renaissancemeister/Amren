<h1>Former Principal Sues Board for Discrimination</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Post South, October 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The white former principal of East Iberville School has filed a federal lawsuit claiming she was demoted from the job in a case of reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>Maria S. Delouise filed the suit for unspecified monetary damages in U. S. District Court in Baton Rouge naming as defendants the Iberville Parish School Board, Superintendent P. Edward Cancienne Jr., Board President Melvin Lodge of St. Gabriel and former St. Gabriel Mayor George L. Grace Sr.</p>
<p>She alleged Cancienne promised Lodge and Grace, both black, she would be demoted so East Iberville could have an African American principal.</p>
<p>In her lawsuit, Delouise claims Cancienne told her &#8220;this is not about your job performance. This is about the color of our skin. You are not the right color for this job. They want a Black principal.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to her suit, she filed a racial discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in March and was demoted to librarian in May.</p>

		<p>Denver Public Schools practices discrimination against white would-be principals, too. It is not reverse-discrimination, it is discrimination.</p>

		<p>Whether you&rsquo;re in an all black district or in an all white district, if you&rsquo;re white you&rsquo;re the wrong color for the opening. </p>
<p>When white commit crimes they don&rsquo;t call it a &#8216;reverse carjacking&rsquo; they call it a hate crime. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Reverse&#8221; discrimination.  There goes the media and their loaded language again.  No one I know uses that term, in fact the only people that do are media lefties.    </p>

		<p>Disgusting, and nauseating.  Pass the barf bag.  BUT AT LEAST THESE WHITES ARE STANDING UP FOR THEMSELVES!!! Bravo.  Most of them say oh, well, I&rsquo;ll get a job somewhere else, too busy for lawsuits - that&rsquo;s for losers.  Because that attitude doesn&rsquo;t work now, we are under siege from a brown tsunami.  Hit back.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Reverse Discrimination&#8221;  makes about as much sense as saying &#8220;I have to get my V.I.N. number.&#8221; <br>
Journalists actually say &#8220;reverse&#8221; discrimination? <br>
It&rsquo;s an imbecilic concept.</p>

		<p> I cannot stand the term &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; because it implies:</p>
<p>That a white must have discriminated first, thus minimizing or somehow justifying discrimination in return by a non-white. Discrimination by a non-white against a white is discrimination!</p>

		<p>Just like the Hampton Inn case yesterday, this is a sign that white people are finally speaking up when they&rsquo;re being discriminated against. If one good thing comes from the Obama presidency, it might be that more white people will finally see this multicultural/diversity thing for the displacement of whites that it really is. </p>

		<p>I know she needs the job. I hope she finds something better. I looked at the schools site and looked at pictures. Every picture had two token white kids among all blacks.  Homeschool those white children and leave those blacks to their own device. </p>

		<p>Like the hotel case the other day she has clear evidence that she was discriminated (not &#8220;reverse&#8221; discriminated) against. If this case is thrown out I hope it is appealed. This is ridiculous and people are waking up to the anti white discrimination out there. </p>

<p>Reverse-discrimination?? If the races were reversed they would be calling for a civil rights violation lawsuit!  The superintendent could be looking at jail time!</p>

		<p>It just goes to show you how scared this school district is of the EEOC considering she filed the complaint in March and was demoted in May. A black dominated government agency will not rule against a black school district. I wish the lady luck, anyway.</p>

		<p>Most likely they can&rsquo;t believe it when it happens to them. After all, their lives are dedicated to modern liberalism, secular humanism, and wielding the power of the state against individuals who dare dissent. But sooner or later reality can be denied no longer and breaks through touching them.</p>

		<p>Anon. #11: This is a great example of why White people, regardless of where they work, should carry a micro audio recorder, or hidden camera, which are available through Electronic Stores. </p>
<p>It is hard to deny such a statement when you have a recording of it, to take to the EEOC, your Union, the local Newspaper, or a good Lawyer. But regardless, always make a second or third copy, in case something &#8220;happens&#8221; to the original tape. </p>
<p>The person who made the statement should be fired,and looking at Jail time for Racial Discrimination. </p>
