			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Childs Walker, Chicago Tribune, September 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Naval Academy midshipman was sentenced to six months in military prison and dismissed from the Navy on Thursday after he was convicted of raping a female classmate.</p>
<p>Midshipman 3rd Class Patrick Edmond, 20, was found guilty of raping the female midshipman in her dorm room last October and of lying to military officials. The native of Jackson, Miss., was dismissed from the academy after a seven-member military panel handed down its verdict. He was attending classes at the academy until the conviction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The court-martial for sexual assault was the first at the academy since 2008. The institution endured a series of high-profile assault cases in the mid-2000s and, in response, bolstered programs to promote awareness and to train midshipmen on how to report sex-related crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Edmond exploited a previous romance with the female midshipman to trap her and force her into sex. Defense attorneys, by contrast, portrayed the sex as consensual.</p>

						<p><em><small>Jackson R. Breland, Jackson Free Press, April 29, 2011</small></em></p>
<p><br>
In a bustling Jim Hill High School hallway, students are yelping and shouting to one another joyfully, but one student remains unfazed by the exuberance.</p>
<p>Patrick Edmond, a senior at Jim Hill, is focused on the present, and even more focused on the future. </p>
<p>&#8220;My long-term goal is to be commander-in-chief of the United States of America,&#8221; Edmond says.</p>
<p>To many, this goal may seem overreaching for a teenager, but Edmond is no ordinary high school student. Edmond recently won the 2009 Junior Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps Cadet of the Year award in the Jackson Public School District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the top cadet in a field of 2,000 students from all eight JPS high schools, Edmond serves as brigade commander. On March 31, Edmond led the JPS JROTC in a series of exercises inside the Provine High School gym.</p>
<p>&#8220;I truly cannot imagine my life without the JROTC program. Before joining, I had low self-esteem. I never looked forward to anything in school. Since then, I have gained self-confidence,&#8221; Edmond says. </p>
<p>{snip} Twenty-eight colleges and universities have accepted Edmond to attend their schools. Edmond has also received an astounding $2.1 million in scholarship offers. Although it was a difficult decision, Edmond has chosen to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., starting this fall.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Edmond plans to major in physics and minor in Spanish. After serving in the Navy for several years, Edmond hopes to become a Spanish professor on the collegiate level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers solidify your success in any endeavor,&#8221; Edmond says. Whether Edmond ends up in a classroom or the Oval Office, expect him to be successful.</p>

<p><br>
So even the prosecutors must acknowledge the female midshipman had dated him previously.  It is difficult to hash out rape from relationships gone or going bad.  The female midshipman was as guilty as Edmond for fraternizing in the first place.  True professionalism would have prohibited such a relationship.  I don&rsquo;t know what the military position is on dating, but THERE WAS A REASON FOR SEPARATE SERVICES IN THE PAST.</p>
<p>How can we support white women (assuming she&rsquo;s white) when they date those who they must know have a poor record of civil behavior, and comprise the highest rates of STDs including HIV? </p>
<p>When are white women and white parents going to wise up?</p>

		<p>Not to worry, by the time he is old enough, a prior rape conviction will be no big hinderence for a Presidential candidate.  That is, going by the standard set by a recent Democratic President and the current one who dressed like a pimp and admitted smoking pot and snorting coke.</p>

<p>From the original article;</p>
<p>&#8220;The report, which also covered the Air Force Academy and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, found that 56 percent of female cadets and midshipmen reported some form of sexual harassment in the previous year.&#8221;</p>

In June, 2009, <a href="/news/2009/06/the_cost_of_a_d.html" rel="nofollow"> Amren reported a story </a> from a professor at the Naval Academy of how the Chief of Naval Operations stated that for the Naval Academy, &ldquo;diversity is the number one priority&rdquo; at the Naval Academy.  The NA would admit lesser qualified minorities and women.  The story was accurately titled, &#8220;The Cost of a Diverse Naval Academy.&#8221;   <br>

<p>- Then this is indeed a case of rape.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if a past relationship existed or not, forced sex is rape, period, even in the case of those being married.  If it is the case that the woman allowed a past companion to gain such close, private access, then she needs to gain some understanding of the male thought process. Granted, she has learned the hard way, but hopefully (never ending) instances such as this will move the Services to implement policies that will actually help to avoid such cases in the future.</p>
<p>1-Anon: &#8220;It is difficult to hash out rape from relationships gone or going bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I would have to strongly disagree on this point.  Defense attorneys and our legal system may, unfortunately, have pushed the point of past relationships into being a mitigating circumstance of some sort, but I would bet most women in such a situation could very clearly make the distinction of rape or non-rape. Again, it seems to me the female penchant for excessive empathy towards men gets everyone into far more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.  More laws or having the liberals train our kindergartners with &#8220;how-to&#8221; videos will not solve such problems; some type of relationship training, using cases such as this for examples of what NOT to do may be of some value.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hardly the same kind of rape if they&rsquo;d had sex before.  I am not sure I would convict in that circumstance given the &#8220;he said, she said&#8221; aspect.</p>

		<p>I lay a lot of the blame on retired U.S.Representative Patricia Schroeder who did more to ruin our armed forces in the &rsquo;80s with her social engineering than anyone else. She felt that females could be as successful in ALL phases of military life as men. I do not doubt their intelligence but the physical aspect of military life USED to be what separated the men from the boys. Then she tried to put women on the front lines with the men. I just can&rsquo;t picture the retaking of Hue, Inchon invasion, frozen Chosin, or any other memorable military conflict including women (God love &#8216;em) as front line members of the military. After service on a WWII LST in Nam, the sight of female naval officers in their blue jumpsuits make me want to gag. As Mammy in GWTW would say, &#8220;taint fitting, jes taint fittin&#8221;.<br>

Considering the trajectory of the United States, in the near future there will be few obstacles or objections to Mr. Edmund achieving his goal.</p>

		<p>So now in the not too distant military services future we will see in the news:</p>
<p>Continuing rapes of white women by blacks.<br>
White male rapes by male blacks.<br>
White women raped by both white and black females.<br>
Then if there are any mascot animals, well, let&rsquo;s hope they can run faster than the new breed of military men/women/its.  </p>
<p>And this is unfair of course to the vast majority of men and women that honorably serve their country.  That is the point, the marxists in the administration, including obama, are destroying our military.  Women shouldn&rsquo;t be serving in situations where there will be attacks on them, treat them like any other soldier and what else could we expect.</p>
<p>I have friends and relatives in each of the academies, serving in active deployment and reserves.  From what I have seen and what these folks have told me, the United States will have a problem in just a few short years. I left the service while things were still relatively normal, including the ticket-puncher brass that will now sell us out to keep their retirement.  My two children have both expressed an interest in serving but I am to the point of discouraging them.  Do I want my daughter to serve under a lesbian DI or my son to sleep in a rack next to a homosexual?  No and I think that is what these marxists want, the good Americans that will obey the Constitution to not get in the way.    </p>

		<p>Blacks are but 12.6% of the population, yet commit 58% of ALL violent crime. (US Dept. of Justice; FBI Uniform Crime Report)<br>
 <br>
On Average there are 37,500 black on white rapes per year with the opposite being statistically insignificant.<br>
 <br>
<a href="https://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=26368" rel="nofollow">https://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=26368</a><br>
&ldquo;In the United States in 2005, 37,460 white females were sexually assaulted or raped by a black man, while between zero and ten black females were sexually assaulted or raped by a white man.  What this means is that every day in the United States, over one hundred white women are raped or sexually assaulted by a black man. &ldquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see the real truth of the matter, let us take a look at the Department of Justice document Criminal Victimization in the United States, 2005. (Go to the linked document, and under &#8220;Victims and Offenders&#8221; download the pdf file for 2005.) <br>
&ldquo;In Table 42, entitled &#8220;Personal crimes of violence, 2005, percent distribution of single-offender victimizations, based on race of victims, by type of crime and perceived race of offender,&#8221; we learn that there were 111,590 white victims and 36,620 black victims of rape or sexual assault in 2005. (The number of rapes is not distinguished from those of sexual assaults; it is maddening that sexual assault, an ill-defined category that covers various types of criminal acts ranging from penetration to inappropriate touching, is conflated with the more specific crime of rape.) In the 111,590 cases in which the victim of rape or sexual assault was white, 44.5 percent of the offenders were white, and 33.6 percent of the offenders were black. In the 36,620 cases in which the victim of rape or sexual assault was black, 100 percent of the offenders were black, and 0.0 percent of the offenders were white. The table explains that 0.0 percent means that there were under 10 incidents nationally. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The table does not gives statistics for Hispanic victims and offenders. But the bottom line on interracial white/black and black/white rape is clear: &ldquo;</p>
<p>NOTE!  Since Obama has been in office this information has been deleted from the above reference site.</p>

		<p>Rape in the military is a big hobby horse of the feminists.  Yet, to the extent that there is a problem, I bet that black men in the military commit most of these rapes.</p>

<p>On several occasions in the past, I have explained here on AR why black crime could never possibly lead to black self-genocide.  I won&rsquo;t waste AR&rsquo;s time again, so I&rsquo;ll link to a version I told on my own soapbox:</p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m going to write a treatment screenplay for Hollywood and submit it for their approval, but I&rsquo;ll need to tweak a few details. </p>
<p>First, Midshipman Edmond is on his way to the Soldier of the Year Board, where his knowledge base will be tested and he will have a chance at early promotion. However, this honorable black youth is resented by Ensign James Smith, a smarmy blond-headed WASP who is jealous of his success. Ensign Smith concocts a scheme to set Edmond up on charges of raping a white female. Because of the inherently racist nature of military justice, Edmond will be convicted. Later, a wise black investigator (preferably played by Morgan Freeman or Denzel Washington) will help free him from his false imprisonment.</p>
<p>This should be quite profitable, sort of like &#8220;The Blind Side&#8221; meets &#8220;Antwoin Fisher&#8221; meets &#8220;Finding Forrester.&#8221;</p>

		<p>This is not even the tiniest bit surprising to me. The amount of rape going on in the service is probably astronomical.Now that being gay is OK look for an increase NOT in the &#8220;Ken Doll blue-eyed white bread fighter pilot/Arabic translator&#8221; that has come to symbolize gays in the military,for those types,however publicized,are few and far between;what you&rsquo;ll see is black and Latino homosexuals and what you&rsquo;ll get are disease,sexual assault and chaos.  That the white woman in the article above would rut with this black is absolutely disgusting and sickening. I have zero sympathy for her. Its laughable that so many of these conservative radio goofs love to spout about what a great success integration has been for the Army!! </p>

<p>A classroom or the Whitehouse. Only 2 choices? How about a third choice? The obvious choice. Prison. He sure didn&rsquo;t disappoint in that regard. From a liberal writer (Childs Walker)telling us in April that Edmond had success written all over him, to a prison cell in September. I wonder what Walker thinks of Edmond now?</p>

one year in Nam and I earned two, repeat 2 medals. What a<br>
bodacious, ridiculous, unmerited joke this clown is. He thinks he is entitled to this fruit salad. I wish Col Hackworth were still alive to marvel and comment on that uniform. There is<br>
a book out named &#8220;Stolen Valor&#8221;. Maybe this SOB can prosecuted<br>

		<p>28 colleges offered him 2.1 million dollars? So essentially he was offered roughly $70 grand per school??? </p>
<p>That is for a guy who says &#8220;I never looked forward to anything in school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Basically if you create even the slightest appearance of being remotely close to being able to function in white society you will be showered with an infinite gravy train of free loot.</p>
<p>Then again who knows where that number even came from. He could have just made it up. He seems to have some very severe delusions of grandeur. He assumes he could just coast through a college physics program with no prior academic interests, somehow wind up a college Spanish professor, and then make the jump from Spanish professor to president of the United states.<br>

		<p>Judging from the garbage this fool has on his uniform he is perfect for president&hellip;&hellip;.of Uganda or Zimbabwe or South Africa. </p>
<p>This story illustrates how low the service academies have fallen from the days of Stonewall Jackson, Robert Lee, Ike, Patton, Douglas MacArthur, &#8220;Bull&#8221; Halsey and many others of yesterday.  </p>
<p>I believe that in those times the academy curriculum was mostly science and math oriented with a heavy emphasis on learning from military masters like Napoleon Bonaparte.  </p>
<p>I wager that much of the curriculum has shifted away from hard subjects to those in which blacks can excel, like black studies, basketball and etc.</p>
<p>Col Hackworth (RIP) saw the PC movement coming and harbored a profound distrust for those above full colonel.  He referred to them as &#8220;perfumed princess&#8221; who where out to get their &#8220;ticket punched&#8221;.  </p>
<p>These &#8220;ticket punchers&#8221; will say and do anything to get that next star.  Thus you had Gen. Kelly say something like &#8220;it would be a tragic thing if the Ft. Hood shooting damaged the Army&rsquo;s DIE-versity effort&#8221;.  Idiot!!! </p>
<p>Poster #4 mentioned that the Chief of Naval Operations had stated that, for the Naval Academy, &ldquo;diversity is the number one priority&rdquo;.  It doesn&rsquo;t stop there, this PC drivel.  </p>
<p>Awhile back the new director of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, (FLETC) stated in front of a large gathering of employees that the greatest problem faced by Federal Law Enforcement was lack of diversity. </p>
<p>Aware instructors knew, however, that the training and recruiting of federal officers was grossly inferior to that of many local cops. In their disgust, a saying among instructors was that &#8220;we send new officers out armed with a 71 and a gun.&#8221; </p>
<p>The shenanigans of the ATF prove the point.   </p>
<p>There is a phenomenon known as regression to the mean over time.  The case with ATF and Customs is that they started at the mean intelligence and now regressed below it.  </p>
<p>But at least they are very diverse, especially the useless Customs agency.  As an aside, the latter has for years been a homosexual hangout.  It was known that in this agency to get ahead&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;I won&rsquo;t go there.    <br>

		<p>To sbuffalonative #8: Take heart Native Buffalonian, because I see White women with White twins, triplets, and with children ranging in age from 6 months to 10 years old, where I live. </p>
<p>Remember, in your case, Buffalo being the City that it is, trash collects in one pile, regardless of race or color, so one must expect that White Trash women would naturally seek out black trash men. </p>

		<p>Anon #4: Of course, AmRen ran an article about the Diversity being sought by the Chief of Naval Operations, as I recall, being his utmost priority. </p>
<p>We can see the fruits of such a policy here, but none of these people will ever admit to a mistake, and perhaps, reverse such a disasterous objective. Not when they are trying to play the PC game.</p>
<p>This topic, of women serving in the Military, and especially in Combat Arms, was the subject of testimony that was given by Marine Colonel John W. Ripley, a Navy Cross recipient, when he stated to Congress that both women in Combat Arms, and open Homosexuality, would destroy the morale, and readiness, of the American Military Services.</p>
<p>You can read his Biography, and Testimony to Congress in the book, &#8220;An American Knight: The Life of Colonel John W. Ripley, USMC&#8221;.  </p>

1-Anon: &ldquo;It is difficult to hash out rape from relationships gone or going bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- &#8220;I would have to strongly disagree on this point. Defense attorneys and our legal system may, unfortunately, have pushed the point of past relationships into being a mitigating circumstance of some sort, but I would bet most women in such a situation could very clearly make the distinction of rape or non-rape. Again, it seems to me the female penchant for excessive empathy towards men gets everyone into far more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth. More laws or having the liberals train our kindergartners with &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; videos will not solve such problems; some type of relationship training, using cases such as this for examples of what NOT to do may be of some value.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several have echoed by own comment.  The problem is that women too often make arbitrary decisions on what is harassment, what is rape, etc.  I hate rape, but I know too many cases, and there are plenty in the records, of women who claimed rape falsely.  Having dated the guy and then decide that one episode was rape is not clearly rape.  A situation where she was walking home one night and a stranger jumped her and raped her is clear.  The PC promoted &#8220;friend rape&#8221; has been a windfall for prosecutors and supplied Feminists with lots of vengeance points to score against men in general, but all this has done is make the charge in circumstances like this require more investigation and MONEY to figure out.  If she had refused to date him, she would have been acting properly and preventing predictable problems.  </p>

<p>Relatives who work for the UK goverment tell me that about 12 years ago the British military stopped recruiting african and carribbean men.  The reason was they they had sex with each other all the time and the military did not want to turn into an STD and AIDS clinic.  At one point, black military men had the highest rate of AIDS in the UK. They were not gay you understand, they just had their needs. Something like not yet toilet trained year old babies.<br>

		<p>I have a friend who is in her early 50&rsquo;s.  She was about 16 when the Judicial dictators ordered the service academies to accept women.  Her Father was an army colonel at the time.</p>
<p>She was agressively recruited for all the academies.  She told them absolutely not; I don&rsquo;t have the math and science skills, I don&rsquo;t want to study 12 hours a day, I have no interest in the jogging, weightlifing and other physical parts of the program.</p>
<p>They told both her and her parents that if she would attend her choice of the academies, she would receive Cs and Bs no matter what her actual grades were and that she would pass all the physical training.</p>

The further denigration of women by our judicial system just adds to the injury. &#8220;Friend rape&#8221; could well be avoided, and the benefit would only accrue for our women, and thus assist us in our overall efforts.</p>

		<p>There are certainly a number of particulars like that to take into consideration. That may be a nice level to bring up. I offer the ideas above as common inspiration but clearly there are questions just like the one you convey up where an important factor might be working in honest good faith. I don?t know if best practices have emerged round things like that, but I am positive that your job is clearly recognized as a good game.
