<h1><a href="http://www.hudson-ny.org/2480/spain-dog-poisoning">Muslims in Spain Declare Jihad on Dogs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Soeren Kern, Hudson New York, October 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Spanish authorities are investigating the recent deaths by poisoning of more than a dozen dogs in Lérida, a city in the northeastern region of Catalonia that has become ground zero in an intensifying debate over the role of Islam in Spain.</p>
<p>All of the dogs were poisoned in September {snip} in Lérida&rsquo;s working class neighbourhoods of Cappont and La Bordeta, districts that are heavily populated by Muslim immigrants and where many dogs have been killed in recent years.</p>
<p>Local residents say Muslim immigrants killed the dogs because according to Islamic teaching dogs are &#8220;unclean&#8221; animals.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, residents taking their dogs for walks have been harassed by Muslim immigrants opposed to seeing the animals in public. Muslims have also launched a number of anti-dog campaigns on Islamic websites and blogs based in Spain.</p>
<p>In response to the &#8220;lack of sufficient police to protect the neighbourhood,&#8221; 50 local residents have established alternating six-person citizen patrols to escort people walking their dogs.</p>
<p>In July, two Islamic groups based in Lérida asked city officials to regulate the presence of dogs in public spaces so they do not &#8220;offend Muslims.&#8221; Muslims are demanding that dogs be banned from all forms of public transportation including all city buses as well as from all areas frequented by Muslim immigrants.</p>
<p>Muslims in Lérida say the presence of dogs violates their religious freedom and their right to live according to Islamic principles.</p>

<p>The Quran in no way implies dogs are unclean or should be avoided. That is hysteria from the Hadiths. In fact Mohammed stated that the prostitute who saw a dog nearly dying from thirst, and dipped her shoe into a well in order to give the dog a drink, would be rewarded in heaven. Another time when the Muslim Armies were on the march he spotted a dog that had a newborn litter of puppies, he assigned one of his men to watch over her so the canine family would not be harrassed or molested by any of his soldiers passing by.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve descended into to full high-school dropout, angry white male mode. It isn&rsquo;t enough that these horribly ignorant, backward, superstitious, time-warped &#8220;people&#8221; are a blot on on any modern society, and that their entire demeanor seems calculated to antagonize non-believers, a right they insist upon in lands they never set foot in before, and didn&rsquo;t fight and die for&hellip;no, in their unnaturalness they believe that man&rsquo;s oldest companion, who has lived with us for centuries, ran with us on the hunt, defended hearth and home&hellip;is &#8220;unclean&#8221;, and fit only to be killed in the street.</p>
<p>  Yeah, I love dogs. I REALLY love dogs. Like the bumpersticker says &#8220;The more I see of people&hellip;&#8221; I don&rsquo;t even want to think of what I might do should anyone harm my dog. Anyway,</p>
<p><br/>
  I sincerely hope that if the Golden Age Devi wrote of comes about, that all practitioners of the Three Misery Sand Religions are swept up and away..if not to Rapture, then to a pile of sand in the Middle East, where they and their murderous &#8220;religions of peace&#8221; belong.  Ugh.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d like to see them try to harass somebody walking a big mean pit bull. As usual with whining groups of any description, they are always strong in large numbers but wimpy on their own when up against a stronger adversary. I bet the only dogs they attack or threaten to attack are little or no threat. Likewise, anybody can tell you poisoning a dog that bothers no one is a cowardly act. They have a lot of nerve demanding dogs be kept out of public places. It should be the other way around: Muslims kept out of sight, as in out of the country, at least the ones who come around, don&rsquo;t like things the way they are and start trying to change things to their own version of how life should be. </p>
<p>How easily the Spanish forgot their own history of the lengthy and brave battle their forefathers fought to rid their country of the despised Muslim occupiers, truly one of the greatest feats in medieval  European history, when they sent the Moors packing back to where they came from.</p>

<p>HELL!! We in America need to stop it, this will be here sooner than you think..Also, a paradox of sorts, the &#8220;ROYALS&#8221; of Kuwait keep big, ferocious dogs in their living compounds and all over Iraq (and I have been ALL OVER Iraq) as one passes Iraqi homes in the fields, one gets chased by the homeowners&rsquo; dogs so apparently not ALL muslims think dogs are unclean. Remember too, Spain is where the Cordoba Initiative of the Manhattan project got its&rsquo; name and most Americans don&rsquo;t know the significance of that name. It took 700 years to get the muslims out of Spain and now they&rsquo;re BACK! </p>

		<p>Anybody who claims that this is not part of Islam does not know what they are talking about. Read the Koran and the Haditha and you will see that what is supposedly only extremist Islam is really quite mainstream and the very nature of the cult.</p>
<p>The conman, armed robber, and cult leader named Mohammed borrowed from many religions. He took this idea of dogs and cats as evil from Zoroastrianism. </p>
<p>I had an experience with some Afhgans here in our country. My friendly little dog, who loved people and thought that all women were kind, ran up to make friends with an afghan woman in a State Park. She got hysterical about my sweet little dog, who looked like a living teddy bear. She screamed and yelled and was absolutely furious about my dog trying to make friends with her. </p>

<p>And for 700 years prior to that large portions of Spain were ruled by the invader. And correct too, for 500 years Spain was free of the invader and now they&rsquo;re back in a big way much to the detriment of everyone.</p>

		<p>In the last few decades, Spain has been run by one of the world&rsquo;s trashiest and foolish political classes.<br/>
 For some reason the jerks who run Spain are trying ever-so hard to prove their &#8216;liberal&rsquo; credentials by implenting the daftest possible immigration laws, as if they are trying to &#8216;out-Scandinavia&rsquo; the Scandinavians.<br/>
  All these jerks have succeeded in doing is to rende Spain as one of the world&rsquo;s worst economic basket-cases (20%+ unemployment and massive debts), and to spit on the graves of their ancestors who fought for so hard for so long to rid Spain of the Moors.</p>

<p>Most Muslims believe it is okay to keep working dogs (herding or guard dogs).  I have an Anatolian Shepherd, very large Turkish  dogs bred to guard livestock. Fantastic animals, however far different than most other breeds. They are like giant cats, they bond closely yet they do not take orders from humans or have any desire to obey commands. I credit their nature to the Muslim history, they have not been wussified like most European breeds.</p>

<p>Not all Muslims are the same I had Afghani neighbors (probably pretty conservative, the father wore a full beard and the mother wore the hijab). Their older son got a Boxer, one night when temps in our area were going to drop below freezing I went next door to ask them to be sure their dog wasn&rsquo;t left outside (he was out barking) and the father told me they DO keep him inside at night. Then he showed me the scratches inside their door from the dog as proof. They were good people. Like the poster above, Brown-Eyed Devil, I truly love dogs and prefer their company to that of most humans.</p>
<p>The Kangal/Anatolian Shepherd is the national dog of Turkey. The breed is now protected by the government and exports have been banned. Kurdistan also claims they are the originator of the Kangal (2000 year old breed) so apparently dogs DO have a place in Muslim culture.</p>

		<p> The Prophet Mohammed was very fond of cats, but not of dogs. He looked at them as utilitarian animals, not pets. Dogs are acceptable as watch dogs and herding farm animals only. There is no Saint Francis inspired blessing of animal pets, as is done in some churches, in Islam. In fact, any dog that entered a Mosque would risk immediate expulsion and probably death. In the Hadith the Prophet is particularly censorious against black dogs, probably due to their associations with black magic and witchcraft. I would say that most devote Muslims do not share the same attitude toward dogs as the British and Americans.</p>

		<p>Good!  Maybe white Europeans will consider having their own babies instead of wasting their parental affections on dogs.  I have nothing against dogs, but it is sickening to see how many childless whites dote after their precious dogs while neglecting the propagation of their own race.</p>

		<p>The first time I read that Moslems hold dogs to be &#8220;unclean&#8221;, I thought, &#8220;What a sick society!&#8221;  Dogs have been with us since the caves, and, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t like dogs has something of humanity missing in his psyche!  <br/>
In the hillbilly culture in which I was born, raised, and live today, dogs are almost always esteemed.  Recently, my husband has been hospitalized, and, every day, I bring our dog to visit.  It&rsquo;s always like running a velvet gauntlet to get our 42-pound mongrel to his room.  People  &mdash;  especially countrified people  &mdash;  fawn over her, talking and petting.  Once, however, a black man emerging from an elevator cried out, &#8220;Oh, a d*** dog!&#8221;, and a Moslem-garbed woman appeared fearful of passing her.  <br/>
Only in white, Western society are dogs fully accorded the status they deserve.</p>

<p>Uhhh&hellip;I am quite racist, though thank you for your &#8220;warning&#8221;. Yes, the same principles apply to breeding dogs and humans. Islam is a religion, not a race, and many Muslims really are good hearted folks that try to do the right thing (and the vast majority stay in their OWN homelands by choice as well as protect their homelands). That does not in any way mean they should be allowed to immigrate to White countries and it certainly does not mean they have any right to commit crimes and change the culture of White nations. </p>

if you knew anything about Ottoman history you&rsquo;d know that nearly all technological developments came from enslaved white christians (and sadly enough mercenaries and traitors, like the cannons that brought down Constantinople) </p>
<p>3 million white Europeans were enslaved by muslims via piracy (and many more by conquest) sometimes families could ransom them but two types of people had no chance of ever being ransomed: fair women and any sort of european tradesman : shipwright, metalsmith, etc. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Muslims in Lérida say the presence of dogs violates their religious freedom and their right to live according to Islamic principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, according to Muslim logic, dog walkers must lose the right to live according to their own sense of life and freedom.</p>
<p>In this small case we begin to see where the increasing invasion of Islam into the west will inevitably lead. Muslims are irrevocably committed to destroying every culture and religion except their own, and they think of murder as justified toward this end.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Quuran says that dogs are unclean or not isn&rsquo;t the issue. The issue is, like all non white immigrants in Western countries, they come to Spain and then demand that the host people change and give up their rights to make the newcomers comfortable. </p>
<p>This is going on right now in the US. I have a relative who works for the public health department (ie, welfare dept) as a nurse. She is fairly liberal and doesn&rsquo;t share my views about race, but she has also told me about Middle Eastern and African men who come into the clinic for an exam but then refuse to let her touch them in ANY way. If Muslim men don&rsquo;t want nurses to touch them, then they shouldn&rsquo;t be going to a Dr office, nor should they be in this country.</p>
<p>#3- I would like to see PETA understand this issue, but I doubt it. They, just like the radical environmental groups, will never see the problems with unchecked immigration. Remember that in modern Western society being opposed to any non white causes is the ultimate sin that trumps all other issues. </p>

		<p>Islam rose in S. Arabia.  The arabs were a herding people.  I always wondered why they did not develop herd dogs as other pastoral herding people did.</p>
<p>Does Sonya or anyone know why?  Given the lack of street cleaning in arab countries, I can understand why arabs don&rsquo;t like dogs in arab countries.  But in Spain, a country with street cleaning services, dog neutering, no packs of feral wild dogs running the streets and scooper and leash laws, I don&rsquo;t see why the muslims can&rsquo;t see the difference between their filthy cities and clean Spanish cities.</p>

		<p>The Anatolian Shepherd was bred at a time when there were no Turks, Kurds, or Muslims in Anatolia. Turks did not begin arriving in Anatolia in even small numbers until around 800AD, which is also the time that Islam was founded in the faraway Arabian penninsula. Kurds did not arrive in Anatolia until the Muslim rulers brought them from Iraq. At that time, Anatolia was part of the Greek, Roman, Parthian, and Persian empires.</p>

<p>They do use herding dogs. In Iran the nomad sheep herders always had dogs, most that I saw were Australian Shepherds but also some large mixed breed guard dogs as well. Afghans/Greyhounds/Salukis are Middle Eastern hunting dogs, the Canaan is a Middle Eastern herding dog.</p>
<p>Prior to the rise of Islam dogs were a VERY big part of Middle Eastern culture and very highly regarded. Scientists now believe domesticated dogs originated in the Middle East (they used to think they originated in Asia but mitochondrial DNA now shows they are most likely decendants of Middle Eastern wolves).<br/>

		<p>&#8220;Most Muslims believe it is okay to keep working dogs (herding or guard dogs). I have an Anatolian Shepherd, very large Turkish dogs bred to guard livestock. Fantastic animals, however far different than most other breeds. They are like giant cats, they bond closely yet they do not take orders from humans or have any desire to obey commands. I credit their nature to the Muslim history, they have not been wussified like most European breeds&#8221;</p>
<p>I also have an Anotolian Shepherd. What you say is mostly correct. However they are fiercely loyal to their owners. Unlike many types of Cats. They are great dogs. </p>

		<p>They hate dogs because dogs give warning to their intended victims when the muzzies come as thieves in the night.  When the founder of the religion of peace was raiding caravans the ones with dogs usually were better able to fight back as the dogs warned the caravans that there was danger from Mo&rsquo; and his raiders.</p>
<p>Also, a few guard/watch dogs in the harem tent enabled a man to keep his wife, slaves, daughters and mothers safe from rapist bandits.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t have that can we, any woman that can be grabbed is subject to rape according to some interpetations of islam. The very first poisoning of dogs by muslims was probably the guard dogs of the neighboring tribes who had not yet seen the light of islam.</p>

<p>Very true. Incredibly loyal and completely devoted to making sure their people (or their sheep) are kept safe from predators. They don&rsquo;t listen but that is good because their instincts regarding threats are better than ours.</p>

		<p>I was a bit worried about Imytholia after we had our daughter.  Imytholia&rsquo;s a 175-lb timber wolf mix.  She can place both front paws on my shoulders and knock me down.  She has never been anything but protective of our daughter, however.  I think Imytholia believes she&rsquo;s Ariadne&rsquo;s real mother.</p>
<p>Dogs (wolves, really) were mankind&rsquo;s first domesticated animals.  </p>
<p>Imytholia has been a fast friend in dark times for me.  Dogs (and wolves) are like that.  Good people deserve canine companionship.</p>

&#8220;Good! Maybe white Europeans will consider having their own babies instead of wasting their parental affections on dogs. I have nothing against dogs, but it is sickening to see how many childless whites dote after their precious dogs while neglecting the propagation of their own race.&#8221;</p>
<p>I totally agree with you.  I live in Marin County up in the hills.  Most of the neighbors own shepherds, dobermans,labs, rots and other large nasty dogs.  Because of the hills, there are no fenced yards.  So the dogs run wild all day and night.</p>
<p>Lucky me, I have a garage to keep my garbage cans.  Many houses have carports.  So the dogs get in the garbage cans, dig out the sacks of garbage and drag it all over the neighborhood often depositing other people&rsquo;s garbage in my yard and driveway.</p>
<p>I have a cat to go after the field mice.  I do not believe in litter boxes, so I keep a window open for the cat.  Sometimes the neighbor&rsquo;s dogs get in the house and make a mess, or steal the kids stuffed animals, chew and slobber on it and leave it all dirty somewhere down the road.</p>
<p>Last year my daughter had the cutest winter coat.  Red and black plaid with a hood and black boots to wear with it.  It was warm at recess. So she and other kids took their coats off to play.<br/>
A dog stole her coat and took it off to the woods to play with it.</p>
<p>There is no school bus.  So my kids have to walk home about 2 miles.  The last mile is straight up the hill on the lane that is patrolled by packs of vicius very large dogs taller than 6 and 7 year old kids.  I have to work so I worry all the time about the dogs attacking the kids on their way home.</p>
<p>That school is in a redwood grove and very cool in summer.  There are a lot of picnic tables on the school lot.  People like to go there in summer during heat waves.  But the dog packs swarm as soon as people take their food out.</p>
<p>When I find the creatures in my house I take them to the pound immediately.  There is no leash law in my town.  Often the dogs are not registered.  Unfortunately the owners always call the pound when the creature doesn&rsquo;t appear for dinner.</p>
<p>They they scream at me that they will sue me. I scream back about restraining orders.</p>
<p>It is a lovely lane, no sidewalks, lots of trees, only a mile from a national park.  But no one can walk on that lane without being attacked by these large, barking, slobbering creatures that should be confined to their owners houses.</p>
<p>I have never smashed up glass and put it in hamburger, but I full well understand people who scatter poisoned hamburger in their yards and driveways to keep those disgusting creatures from depositing feces and other people&rsquo;s garbage in their yards.</p>
<p>A few times I have spoken to the city council about a leash law.  They tell me, forget it, the psycho neurotic dog lovers rule the town.  The only opposistion to the dogs are the deer lovers.  There are even more deer than dogs around.  The deer are a smallish variety.  The dog packs are always running them down and eating them.</p>
<p>Dog lovers vs deer lovers.  Animal loving loons against each other.</p>
<p>If you want some absolutely hilarious reading, google pit bull advocates, Darla Napora, and crate and rotate.</p>
<p>Most of the pit bull advocates are psycho neurotic ultra liberal women, the same kind you find marching against the death penalty, occupying wall street and working at non profits counseling black thugs and bringing  Somalians to this country.<br/>
