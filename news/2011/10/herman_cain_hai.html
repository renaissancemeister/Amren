			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huffington Post, October 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Herman Cain says that when he is elected president, he&rsquo;ll change the traditional presidential entrance music, &#8220;Hail to the Chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s traditional, and that&rsquo;s all well and good,&#8221; Cain told host Chris Wallace on &#8220;Fox News Sunday.&#8221; &#8220;But I happen to believe that there comes a time when you need to change the mood of it just a little bit  &mdash;  not drastically, but change it just a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s kind of like in marketing. Periodically companies that have been successful in branding, they might modify their logo just a little bit to give it a fresher look. I think &#8216;Hail to the Chief&rsquo; needs a little bit fresher sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallace asked Cain what sort of new sound he had in mind. &#8220;So, hip-hop?&#8221; Wallace asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&rsquo;t be hip-hop,&#8221; Cain replied. &#8220;I might put some gospel beats in &#8216;Hail to the Chief&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Herman Cain as the next black president, strutting up to the microphone to a funkifized version of &#8220;Hail to the Chief.&#8221;  Right out of the film, &#8220;Idiocracy.&#8221;  Only he be eattin&rsquo; pizza.  (No doubt, barbe-que chicken pizza).</p>
<p>The GOP proffering of Cain also reminds me of another film, &#8220;Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou:&#8221;  &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t we git us a Wee Man, ourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>And finally; His name is Cain!  Didn&rsquo;t Mit Romney&rsquo;s creed claim until recently that black skin was &#8220;the mark of Cain?&#8221;</p>
<p>The guy is making the solution for the economy sound like a coupon driven pizza promotion.  If it sounds good, it must be right.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to illustrate symbolically what happens when you begin to change the racial and cultural core of a nation.  This time, it will be &#8220;some Gospel beats,&#8221; but the next black president, (since a white president would expose the residual racial problems in our great nation), will just go with full on hip-hop production, with booty shakin&rsquo; bi!$$s and that gangsta cool that has come to personify the presidency, Congress, and the Judicial.  </p>
<p>Now, everyone will finally be able to get down!  Freedom at last!</p>
<p>Hey, you was all here before us!</p>

		<p>Man, I tell you, ever since he won a meaningless straw poll, the pizza jockey has gotten all full of himself.  Here&rsquo;s hoping that his slap happy too clever by half handing of the Rickroller Perry &#8220;Rock&#8221; non-issue ends his campaign.</p>
<p>There are probably literally a thousand former corporate executives who have had Cain&rsquo;s record of success or better in the business world, and advocate boilerplate conservative Republican ideology.  So why should Cain be elected President before those other 999?  We all know the &#8220;answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, the United States of America is a white country, and therefore it should have a white President.  No black Presidents, not Barack Obama, not Herman Cain, not Colin Powell, not Allen West, not Ezola Foster.  Period.</p>

		<p>It concerns me that guilt consumed whites, who are conservative, are going to try to elect &#8220;their&#8221; black candidate, The Hermanator, so he can battle it out with the &#8220;other&#8221; black candidate, the Obamanation. It will be like a sporting event: whites sitting on the sidelines cheering for their black hero to win. Many whites are secretly concerned that if we don&rsquo;t elect another black, that we will have riots and violence. I say, let it happen! We don&rsquo;t need another black President. Cain is proud of his Blackness and you can tell by little statements he has made that it is important to him. This cycle needs to be broken and fast before it is too far gone to turn around.</p>

		<p>I agree with Rick.  I&rsquo;ll go a step further.  Once this wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing is elected, he will be just like Obama.  Doing for the Bruthas and Screwing over the Muthas (whites).<br>
He just gave us a hint.  He tries to type himself a traditionalist, but then wants to make the national ruffles and flourishes of the President of the US into a gospel, hand clapping parody.  A black thing, in other words.</p>
<p>If ANYBODY out there still thinks there is a black who is NOT a liberal Dem in sheeps clothing, please remember Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice.  Both pushed up the ladder by Republicans, then turned on their &#8220;party&#8221; to endorse Obama.  Black will ALWAYS see themselves as black, and react that way.  </p>

		<p>Whoever didn&rsquo;t believe that Cain would eventually launch that ship is a fool. The day before that, he was &#8216;distressed and saddened&rsquo; that Rick Perry was &#8216;so insensitive&rsquo; because his property used to have a big rock on it nearly a hundred years ago that had the N word painted on it.

		<p>This idiotic statement alone should have every white person working to make sure that Herman never gets to work anywhere outside of a pizza kitchen. What kind of an imbecile even brings up such nonsense during a presidential campaign?</p>
<p>Maybe during the debate Herman will suggest we replace the Statue of Liberty with a 30 story replica of Arethra Franklin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before - this guy is dangerous. He&rsquo;s the Obama of the private sector with a bigger axe to grind against The Man. </p>
<p>If, in some nightmare scenario, he winds up with the nomination we might as well all move to northern Canada and start over. </p>

		<p>Now I&rsquo;m hearing white &#8220;conservatives&#8221; say things like, &#8220;Oooh, I hope Cain gets the nomination, and I hope he picks, say, a Latina as his running mate!  Won&rsquo;t that put the liberals&rsquo; panties in a bunch?  Giggle!&#8221;  </p>
<p>IDIOTS!  I want to slap them.  They fail to realize that it doesn&rsquo;t matter WHO the Republicans nominate.  The Republicans could nominate a lesbian midget Muslim and a Native American wheelchair-user, or any other combination of &#8220;diverse,&#8221; &#8220;politically correct&#8221; candidates, and the libs will STILL call them racist and sexist!  &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; honestly think they can make liberals say, &#8220;Golly, gee!  We&rsquo;ve misjudged the Republicans.  They&rsquo;re not racist, sexist homophobes after all.  We&rsquo;ll shut up and crawl off in shame now.&#8221;  FOOLS!  That will NEVER happen, so why not just choose the best candidate?  </p>
<p>But no.  Instead both parties will try to &#8220;out-diversity&#8221; each other until every presidential ticket looks like a news anchor team, and soon white males will be completely unelectable, if they&rsquo;re not already.</p>
<p>George W. Bush may well have been the last white male President this country will ever have.</p>

<p>If America HAD to have a black president, I wish it had been Herman Cain rather than Hussein Soetero. But of course it&rsquo;s too late for that wish now. </p>
<p>Cain strikes me as   &mdash;   at least by black standards   &mdash;   an intelligent and capable man. His conservative convictions seem sincere, which sets him ahead of 99% of African-Americans in my books. But I just don&rsquo;t want another black president, period. One was more than enough. Even the &#8220;good ones&#8221; like Cain are so racially self-obsessed that they seem to have &#8220;black on the brain.&#8221; Even black conservatives seem to look at life through the prism of Race. Because &#8220;Hail to the Chief&#8221; does NOT need a gospel beat. Or a reggae beat. Or a hip-hop beat. Or a Motown beat. &#8220;Hail to the Chief&#8221; is fine just the way it is. If you don&rsquo;t understand that, I don&rsquo;t want you anywhere near 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Or, to lean on a cliche, It ain&rsquo;t broke so quit trying to fix it!</p>
<p>The Big Question of 2012 will be: &#8220;Is America ready for a White president?&#8221;</p>

		<p>Cain is really not much more than a regular liberal Democrat who supports low tax rates, and pops off about a tax plan &#8220;brought to you by the number nine&#8221; that has no chance of becoming law, because the panoply of people making money off the current tax code being so complicated and convoluted (tax attorneys, CPAs, parasite/billionaires like Buffet), and their in-government bureaucrat friends, will team up to kill it in Congress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking to my prediction that Cain gets no better than a 5% average in primary states and no better than 10% in any one primary state.  Remember, the only &#8220;results&#8221; so far have been either meaningless straw polls or loaded/agitprop opinion polls.</p>
<p>What is unfortunate from a practical political standpoint, at least this &#8220;Rock&#8221; non-story, is that we thought we had Rickroller&rsquo;s campaign dispatched to the ash heap   &mdash;   This might revive it.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s with the roll over and die people here!<br>
Stand up, and act like you own this place!<br>
Herman Cain is unelectable. <br>
He is NOT going to president of anything, unless the RepubliKrats throw the blacks a bone, and put Cain in as Veep. That&rsquo;s of course a nothing job, unless the prez. dies.</p>
<p>No one is electing this man. It&rsquo;s probably going to be Romney.<br>
And for God&rsquo;s sake, choose the lesser of evils! Obama is so toasted, it&rsquo;s not even a possibility. Let&rsquo;s HUMILIATE HIM. He may win only a few states, if we all vote.</p>
<p>I hate Perry, and it looks like the other candidates found their issue to sock it to him. Good! (It&rsquo;s his appaling stance on immigration). So let&rsquo;s trash Perry, support whoever says his immigration record stinks, and then apply maximum support to the primary winner, so we can be rid of Obama&hellip;<br>
(Unless you&rsquo;re a masochist).<br>
Then we can see to squeezing the new Republican president.<br>
I&rsquo;m almost on my back with BRA and Obama&rsquo;s horrid economic blithe.</p>
<p>You want more of that?<br>
If not, stop playing the victim. Make things happen. Stop saying defeatist things likeCain is the next president.</p>

		<p>I cannot understand this mindless adulation of Cain.  I cannot fathom a black representing white interests; that alone should disqualifies him as any kind of representative of white America.</p>
<p>I suspect he has a hidden agenda and desires to change a lot more than &#8220;Hail to the Chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, he is a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing; he prefers government over the free market and is NO conservative. For example, he backed TARP at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 - calling it a &ldquo;recovery plan.&rdquo; He slammed opponents of the program calling them &ldquo;free market purists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cain, is a former board member of the Federal Reserve where there has been an incredible lack of transparency.  He tells us that the central bank already has internal audits, that there isn&rsquo;t anything new that we&rsquo;d learn from an audit and they haven&rsquo;t been hiding anything from Americans. He chalks it up to people not knowing enough about the Fed, as if we&rsquo;re stupid.</p>
<p>Why does Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke claim that they aren&rsquo;t printing money when that&rsquo;s exactly what quantitative easing is?  Despite Cain&rsquo;s claims to the contrary, he is defending the Federal Reserve. And it doesn&rsquo;t reflect the behavior of someone claiming to be a conservative.</p>
<p>Herman Cain?  Not in this life.  <a href="https://goo.gl/Yeu9Q" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/Yeu9Q</a></p>

		<p>I have nothing against Cain. I admire his success in business, but I would not vote for him. I don&rsquo;t believe he is qualified to be President.  What scares me is that he almost won a straw poll. I believe that Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich were far more qualified candidates than Cain. Republican voters would rather vote for someone who looks like a rapper or basketball star than vote for the best qualified. </p>

		<p>This reminds me of Obama&rsquo;s inauguration, where the black minister gave a convocation in which he said &#8220;if you&rsquo;re yellow it&rsquo;s mellow, if you&rsquo;re brown stick around etc&#8221;. <br>
  I couldn&rsquo;t believe it, but no one in the press said anything about it being strange and inappropriate at the time. I remember Obama smiling, he should have gotten up and said &#8220;It&rsquo;s all good&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Conservative whites love Cain because he validates a lot of their feelings about blacks   &mdash;   hatred of ghetto culture, hatred of affirmative action and welfare dependency, pervasive black underachievment and resentment towards whites in the black community, and so forth   &mdash;   without the taint of racism.  Conservatives are much more comfortable arguing their individualist, anti-government ideology from a position of &#8220;colorblindedness.&#8221;  Even if someone reads American Renaissance with an open mind and discovers that a lot of what is published in it makes sense, that person is still likely to have problem saying that whites have a right to treat non-white INDIVIDUALS differently based on the fact they belong to a different racial GROUP, a group with much more negative statistical norms than whites. Such a viewpoint is difficult for a conservative committed to INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS to argue.  For instance, its much easier to argue for colorblind higher education admissions without affirmative action than to argue that non-whites who can get in without AA ought to attend separate institutions.  This is what makes Cain, and black conservatives, so popular among whites: he is validating what seems to be an intellectually defensible position.  </p>

		<p>Any White person who can not see by now that Blacks are obsessed with race must not want to see the truth. They will never give up talking about race because they are taught from a young age to have strong racial identities(just like all other races and ethnic groups, except for Whites).</p>
<p>Herman Cain will gladly steamroll over Western culture if he can get away with it.  </p>

		<p>This is how nations and cultures shift when the governing majority allows itself to be replaced.  The Arab dynasty of the Abbasids kept letting in Turkish Seljuks and hundreds of other groups, until the Seljuks were able to take over, gradually.</p>
<p>The Germanic tribes seeped into Roman territory over two centuries and voila!  They took over when the Romans were sufficiently weak enough.</p>
<p>I was sitting with a group of latinos today who discussing crime patterns in the city.  They showed a map of the urban area and it showed population by race.  The white areas were small and the black, latino and Asian areas were much, much larger.</p>
<p>One of the latinos turned to me and said with real concern, &#8220;What will you do when everyone is attacking the white people?&#8221;  I am not making this up.  I laughed it off to save face, but I don&rsquo;t think I will ever forget that comment.</p>

		<p>The man isn&rsquo;t even in office yet and already he has designs on changing the theme song to the job.  I hope Whites have their eyes open about this man, but I&rsquo;m afriad like some others, that the White guilt compulsion to prove they aren&rsquo;t racists is going to drive millions of consevative White lemmings over the cliff, just as Liberal/Independent lemmings were led to do in 2008.  If that becomes the case and this man turns out to be Black first and Conservative second, the most likely reality, this country is lost.  &#8220;Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, sheme on me&#8221;.  Cain has never held elected office, and yet niether the media or conservatives are raising the issue of his qualifications for the presidency.  Anyone remember all the doubt batted about concerning Sarah Palin&rsquo;s readiness for the vice-presidency?  </p>

<p>Indians as better whites than whites.  This is not all that uncommon in India either. It may arise from the caste system there.  They take on the effects of white civilization but believe in their inherent superiority because of caste where whites don&rsquo;t have a place.</p>

<p>Oh,yes&hellip;.today our local &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show host RAVED about Herman Cain and how great it would be for him to get elected! ALL the callers felt the same way. They said TWO black Presidents in a row just shows that Whites are not racists&hellip;They all claimed they will vote for him and not a White because &#8220;skin color&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t  matter (I guess it sure does if one is White) and it should NEVER matter&hellip;.what idiots they all are. They are all race traitors and cannot even see it. I detest them as much as I do the libs. I had to turn that station off after about 20 minutes of their gushing over the &#8220;new black guy on the block&#8221;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

		<p>cains inane ramblings indicate how unqualified he is to be the most powerful man on earth.</p>
<p>to understand the importance cain places on his race, we need only review his position on affirmative action.</p>
<p>he endorses the latest court approved flavor of affirmative action, suggesting it should be camouflage as &#8220;economic need&#8221;.<br>

<p>how do you feel about the Fed? let&rsquo;s not make the same mistake as last time, and discover all these &#8220;details&#8221; afetr the election &hellip; </p>
<p>cain was deputy chairman and then chairman of the Board of Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for five years! <br>

<p>just as greenspan was creating the dot-com bubble! i&rsquo;m sure there was no affirmative action involved in getting those 2 posts.</p>
<p>his history is in plain for anyone who cares enough to look. but then again, so was obamas -</p>

		<p>Actually, Sureesh has a very good point there. Bobby Jindal was most assuredly born in this country for starters, and anybody can look up his birth certificate, educational transcripts and voting records, unlike certain other politicians we could mention. <br>

<p>Sureesh is the &#8220;messenger&#8221;? Guess you haven&rsquo;t read all his posts. He only points out the &#8220;good&#8221; things in his fellow Indians and loves for them to all come here and &#8220;live&#8221; among us. He brags about how &#8220;smart&#8221; they are (and how crime free they are) and how they can do the &#8220;jobs White Americans will not do&#8221;.. He doesn&rsquo;t care one whit about Whitey, it is only when he can say, &#8220;see, an Indian is even better than any White man you can elect&#8221; or some such garbage,so that the delusional will fall all over themselves agreeing with him. </p>
<p>He and people like him are not &#8220;our friends&#8221;&hellip;.wake up, amreners.</p>

		<p>I always thought &#8220;Hail to the Chief&#8221; was a wimpy song. The president should have a rousing march, at least.

		<p>With Cain, I&rsquo;m just getting tired of seeing blacks everywhere move in on TV. Like every commercial has a black doctor&hellip;then you see the reality where Michael Jackson&rsquo;s doc is on trial for being the candy man.I admit Cain is bright. he is a math major. Good for him, but I&rsquo;m sick of that black accent&hellip; &#8216;Respec&rsquo; and &#8216;Splaining policy.&rsquo; He sounds like Sharpton and Jackson and Obama when he gets emotional. White people should run their own country&hellip;like I opposed Fujimora in Peru&hellip;Peruvians need their own kind in charge.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve listend to Cain&rsquo;s policies. Immigration&hellip;&rsquo;we must prepare them to become citizens.<br>
Iraq,Afghanistan&hellip;&rsquo;we must turn the war over to professionals and let them do it their way.&rsquo;<br>
Nothing but the standard corporate line.<br>
And yes, I think you can say there will NEVER be any action against affirmative action.<br>
&#8216;Jazz up&rsquo; Hail to the Chief? Only an indication of what&rsquo;s coming. It&rsquo;s not our country anymore.</p>
