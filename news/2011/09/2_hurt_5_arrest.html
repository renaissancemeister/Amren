		<p>Culture enriching diversity bestows its blessings on New Hampshire.  For some odd reason, I had thought that New Hampshire had largely been spared culture enrichers so far.  Not so, sadly.</p>
<p>Third world population = third world dysfunction.  Period.  End of story.</p>

<p>Having lived in that part of Southern Illinois for almost all of 2009, I can fill in a few blanks.  While SIUC has enough black students, there is a big chunk of residential blacks in Carbondale, mainly on the northeast side of town.  The student blacks and the resident blacks like to mingle a lot, for parties, drug deals, and other niceties.  I bet what happened here is that when the power went out at that dorm, and all those inside made their way out, various rivals among the resident blacks saw each other and started fighting, and then allied student blacks joined the fray.</p>

		<p>100 people rioting!  This sort of thing never used to happen in Nashua.  Nashua!  Best place to live per Money Magazine several times.  I wonder what has changed&hellip;</p>

		<p>The old &#8221; Live Free Or Die &#8221; state has been invaded with people from Boston who can`t break into the Irish street culture. The blacks and Hispanics are not tolerated by Irish street gangs and Irish cops. Dope dealing,gun running, and bank robbing are as Irish as Paddy`s pig and our Hispanic gang bangers had to go North young man to wreck a little havoc of their own.  Maine`s coastal cities have become urban jungles because of this hood diaspora. Bath Maine is more dangerous than Laredo Texas.<br/>

		<p>3:  What happened is that once that magazine ranked Nashua #1, a lot of &#8220;non-number one&#8221; type people moved there.  Some secrets should stay secrets.</p>
<p>4:  Here&rsquo;s another one:  http://goo.gl/YCSnV</p>
<p>The headline calls them &#8220;city men.&#8221;  Sure, if the city is Dar-Es-Salaam.</p>

		<p>@ poster#5 - Mr. Tiffany, your obvious distaste for the Irish &#8220;street culture&#8221; notwithstanding, you have omitted the main difference between White and non-white &#8220;street culture&#8221;: The massive propensity for random, racially motivated violence.</p>
<p>We have seen a spate of Boston based movies in the last few years that focus on Irish (i.e. White) gangsterism. Yet despite this glorification of criminals there is no reflection of the true street reality: whites cannot walk the streets free from fear of black/brown savagery. When I am in a public area with my children I don&rsquo;t think twice when I see a group of Asians or Indians or Jews. It is only the hordes of Black/Hispanic Youths who make me wary.</p>
