			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Loveys, Daily Mail (London), September 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Teachers are branding thousands of children racist or homophobic following playground squabbles. </p>
<p>More than 20,000 pupils aged 11 or younger were last year put on record for so-called hate crimes such as using the word &#8216;gaylord&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Some of them are even from nursery schools where children are no older than three.</p>
<p>One youngster was accused of being racist for calling a boy &#8216;broccoli head&rsquo; and another was said to be homophobic for telling a teacher &#8216;this work is gay&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Two primary school children were reported for homophobia after quarrelling over a rubber and calling each other &#8216;gay&rsquo; and &#8216;lesbian&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Those youngsters reported for petty offences at nursery classes included four in the London borough of Tower Hamlets and three in Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>Schools are forced to report the language to education authorities, which keep a register of incidents.</p>
<p>Although the Department for Education recently pledged to cut unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, it has given no guidance on such &#8216;offences&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In total, 34,000 nursery, primary and secondary pupils were effectively classed as bigots because of anti-bullying rules. </p>
<p>The school can keep the pupil&rsquo;s name and &#8216;crime&rsquo; on file. </p>
<p>The record can be passed from primaries to secondaries or when a pupil moves between schools.</p>
<p>And if schools are asked for a pupil reference by a future employer or a university, the record could be used as the basis for it, meaning the pettiest of incidents has the potential to blight a child for life.</p>
<p>Figures for the year 2009-10 were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the civil liberties group the Manifesto Club. </p>
<p>Adrian Hart, of the Manifesto Club, called for the Government to roll back the policy of hate speech reporting in schools. He said: &#8216;Children need space to play and to learn the meaning of words, without being reported to the local education authority. </p>
<p>&#8216;These policies are an inappropriate intervention into playground life, and undermine teachers&rsquo; ability to set a moral example to children and to teach them right from wrong. </p>
<p>&#8216;There is a world of difference between racist abuse and primary school playground spats.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The figures show 34,000 racist incidents reported by schools to local education authorities in England and Wales. Of these, 20,000 were at primary schools.</p>
<p>Figures for 2008-9  &mdash;  obtained earlier this year  &mdash;  showed 29,659 reported incidents. </p>
<p>Last year, Birmingham City Council had the highest number, with 1,090 racist incidents, followed by 672 in Leeds and 567 in Hertfordshire. In West Berkshire there were just 15. </p>
<p>In the majority of cases, the &#8216;racist&rsquo; spats involved name-calling.</p>
<p>Schools were required by the Labour government in 2002 to monitor and report all racist incidents to their local authority. Teachers must name the alleged perpetrator and victim and spell out the incident and the punishment. Local authority records show the type of incident but not the name of the child involved.</p>
<p>LEAs are expected to monitor the number of incidents, look for patterns and plan measures to tackle any perceived problems. </p>
<p>Heads who send in &#8216;nil&rsquo; returns are criticised for &#8216;under-reporting&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A DfE spokesman said: &#8216;Parents expect that heads take a very tough line on any poor behaviour and stamp out bullying  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re toughening up teachers&rsquo; disciplinary powers. </p>
<p>&#8216;It is down to schools themselves to exercise their own common sense and professional judgment about the best way of taking on bullies.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Yet another example of a central government&rsquo;s attempting to stage-manage everyone&rsquo;s behavior   &mdash;   set to a &#8220;politically correct&#8221; beat, of course.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not surprising that it was a Labour government which put such idiotic laws into place. They&rsquo;re first cousins to our Democrats   &mdash;   and the two parties&rsquo; respective constituencies are first cousins, too. And by the way, beware any government which announces plans to &#8220;stamp out&#8221; anything as one minister was quoted at the end of this piece. What they&rsquo;re really trying to &#8220;stamp out&#8221; are all your freedoms.</p>

<p>Well, there has been some vicious racism against the people of Greenland. Oh, wait. They&rsquo;re not green are they? Never mind.</p>
<p>I wonder if they are writing any of these kids up for disparaging blonds and gingers? I doubt it.</p>

		<p>I posted this story on a forum that concerns itself with freedom of speech issues, over-powerful government, human rights etc.  Most replies twisted themselves in knots trying to justify it, but without actually saying they justified it, then it disappeared.  </p>

		<p>If day care centers made and kept for analysis a lot of video tape, it is most likely expert analysis would reveal a lot of<br/>
innate sense of &#8220;us/them&#8221; especially involving interactions of<br/>
Black/White pre-school children  There would be little indication that such a sense was other than mostly a built-in/hard-wired  product of human evolution and not something appreciably originating from various &#8220;isms&#8221;. </p>

		<p>I can relate to this story from personal experience.</p>
<p>I have been called every foul, evil, nasty name known to man,<br/>
but even I have to draw a line at Broccoli Head.</p>
<p>How insensitive can these kids be?</p>

		<p>1, The most vicious bully I ever experienced back in school days was Chinese, an ugly thug. This was way back in the days of the white Australia policy and we did not have many of them here. I understand that some of the worst bullies in our schools now are Pacific Islanders.</p>
<p>2, Just like everything else in the natural world our children all want to associate with their own kind. This is totally NORMAL. When are the PC do-gooders going to wake up to this.</p>
<p>3, From the original article it seems like the UK authorities are establishing a data base of race hate, homosexual hate and every other thought crime, may include kids as young as 3. This is quite unbelievable, a bit like  thought police practice in the worst imaginable Orwellian nightmare.</p>

		<p>As a brown skinned person of Indian extraction  I have hardly faced any discrimination from the general public in over 45 years that I have been in the USA. The only discrimination I ever experienced was from co-professionals, worried that I would cut into their business. As some earlier commented this job security for beurocrats and the legal system.</p>
