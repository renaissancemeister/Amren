<h1><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110921-714806.html">European Extremists Set to Make Further Electoral Gains: Report</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Wall Street Journal, September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Populist extremist parties threaten the process of European integration, but may well gain support in coming years as dissatisfaction with the mainstream alternatives grows, according to a report published Thursday by Chatham House.</p>
<p>The report said the sources of support for populist extremist parties, or PEPs, is widely misunderstood, and primarily reflects fears that Europeans will lose their cultural identity in the face of immigration and in particular, settled Muslim groups.</p>
<p>And it found that far from being limited to a small part of European society, those concerns were widely shared, suggesting that PEPs could gain support in future elections.</p>
<p>Far-right parties have generally performed well in recent European elections, making inroads in most countries, with the exceptions of Germany, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Based on surveys of PEP voters in a number of European countries, the report concluded that their support was spread across a number of groups, many of which didn&rsquo;t fit the stereotypical profile of being among globalization&rsquo;s losers, although they are &#8220;deeply pessimistic about their economic prospects.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The citizens who turn out for PEPs at elections tend to be men; they are either very young or very old; have no or only a few educational qualifications [and] come from the lower middle classes or working classes,&#8221; wrote the University of Nottingham&rsquo;s Matthew Goodwin, the report&rsquo;s author.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Anti-Muslim sentiment has become an important driver of support for populist extremists,&#8221; Goodwin wrote. &#8220;This means that appealing only to concerns over immigration  &mdash;  for example calling for immigration numbers to be reduced or border controls to be tightened  &mdash;  is not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who vote for PEPs are frequently seen as driven by primarily economic motives, such as competition for jobs and housing. But Goodwin said that is a misunderstanding of their motives.</p>
<p>&#8220;These feelings of threat do not stem simply from economic grievances,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;They appear to stem from a belief that immigrants, minority groups and rising cultural diversity are threatening the national culture, community and way of life.&#8221;</p>

		<p>These folks in PEPs feel threatened and are giving in to the dangerous politics of fear&hellip; Yet same article has no problem suggesting we should fear PEPs and that they are a threat, if that is not the Very reason for the article and the study. I guess only sometimes is giving in to the politics of fear a bad thing.  </p>

		<p>PEPs? You gotta be kidding me. So this is what those banal SPLC-types at WSJ have come up with to label sane people who don&rsquo;t want their kinsmen to degenerate into cultureless individualists as the Muslims breed them out. Turkey has an &#8216;Insulting Turkishness Law&rsquo; that prosecutes people who spread anti-national sentiment and Europeans need similar legislation to protect their own interests from Liberal Extremist traitors.</p>

		<p>WSJ had a somewhat similar article three days ago:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/cdnUR" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/cdnUR</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the money quote:</p>
<p><i>Parties of the fringe will gain greater sway. Border checkpoints will return. Currencies will be resurrected, then devalued. Countries will choose decay over reform. It&rsquo;s a long, likely parade of horribles.</i></p>
<p>Border control and national currencies.  How horrible.</p>
<p>Actually, those are features, not bugs.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way.  PEP?</p>
<p>Me thinks we need our own PEP Rally.</p>

		<p>Firstly, isn&rsquo;t &#8220;populist extremist&#8221; an oxymoron?</p>
<p>And secondly, all of my friends who agree with my views on immigration are neither very young nor very old, none of them are in the lower middle class or &#8220;working class&#8221; (defined by people being paid wages rather than salaries), and they are either qualified tradesmen in their respective areas or university graduates. I would suggest that their method of collecting data is flawed because once again they&rsquo;ve ignored the silent majority.</p>

		<p> Hooray for the PEP&rsquo;s! The writer of this article can &#8220;view with alarm&#8221; their concern about cultural disintegration of European culture, and possible self-genocide of the various European peoples, if he wants to, but I&rsquo;m glad to see people with White skins fighting back somewhere, for a change!</p>
<p> And this so-called &#8220;European integration&#8221; the PEP&rsquo;s are threatening, has never been all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be, anyway. I seriously doubt that the European Union could survive a popular, up or down vote, of all the European people (I&rsquo;m talking about the REAL Europeans, not the rag, tag and bobtail of immigrants of the last 50 years).</p>

<p>Notice how it was a &#8220;belief&#8221; of &#8220;extremist groups&#8221;.  Look at old photos/films of London, Paris, Rome and hell even Los Angeles and Detroit from the 50&rsquo;s 60&rsquo;s and even into the 70&rsquo;s and tell me there hasn&rsquo;t been a drastic change in culture, community and way of life due to increased &#8220;cultural diversity&#8221; - and not for the better! How many non-White countries would allow hundreds of thousands or millions of White Christians into their countries to the point of changing THEIR culture? Answer - NONE! </p>

		<p>The WSJ is trying to marginalize these parties because MOST!!!! Europeans are sympathetic to their message and may indeed vote for them in the near future.</p>
<p>The Muslim invasion of Europe is well advanced, and the situation is so unspeakably horrible that we&rsquo;re seeing a swing to the right in reaction to it.</p>
<p>The establishment is trying to scare people away from voting for anti-immigration parties by stigmatizing them as &#8220;far right&#8221;.</p>
<p>If this strategy stops working, they will soon the governing Europe.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s quite possible that &#8216;the very young and the very old&rsquo; are the groups most willing to be seen identifying with right-wing populism - they have no jobs to lose. People of working age will share many of the same attitudes, but they have to keep quiet about it or lose their livelihoods.</p>

		<p>This whole &#8220;extremist&#8221; cannard just doesn&rsquo;t resonate with most like it used to. I know MANY folks who are just average joes(and Judy&rsquo;s)who laughingly refer to themsleves now as &#8220;right-wing-extremists&#8221; thanks to the govt., the establishment left and all other usual suspects who have grossly overplayed their hand on this topic. It tends to take the starch out of the whole &#8220;extremist&#8221; concept when church-marms and one&rsquo;s kindly old WW2-vet neighbor openly call themselves extremists for laughs!</p>

		<p>Just by reading the whole tenor of that report it is obvious that the WSJ is an implacable enemy of nationalism and White interests in particular.<br/>
 Take the very first sentence &#8216;threaten the process of European integration&rsquo; - ie daring to voice opposition to that undemocratic,overbearing dictatorship the EU and its duplicitous<br/>
mission to force through a federalist superstate with no public agreement or consent.The cataclysm of the Euro currency is one symptom of his.<br/>
  And the we have further libels.Second-rate &#8216;academics&rsquo; libel supporters of nationalist parties with slogans and stereotypes - but no hard analysis.<br/>
 The fat faced high living Eurocrats are getting a bit peeved, so they are lashing out by calling anyone who questions them nasty names.</p>

		<p>The writer spoke of &#8220;deep pessimism.&#8221;<br/>
I wonder if the other readers here see that this deep pessimism is literally bursting out from the seams all over the USA?<br/>
In Colorado Springs, the tension grows almost daily now.</p>
<p>We have been swamped by Mestizos. Our POVERY RATE has just been announced; 13.5 percent! (I know it&rsquo;s mostly because of the flood of Mestizos and inner city blacks).<br/>
And We&rsquo;re way better off than Denver or Boulder!<br/>
Our poverty rate is is nearly double what it was  a decade ago.<br/>
Everywhere, whites are harried, mad, uptight and beligerent, as our economy implodes. Jobs are gone, yet mestizos run around everywhere. Black thugs roam the streets everywhere. Whites are at their wit&rsquo;s ends, and BROKE.<br/>
It can&rsquo;t last.<br/>
Something&rsquo;s going to happen. I&rsquo;m a little afraid, but I know it can&rsquo;t be stopped. Our people have been pushed into a corner, and they keep getting squeezed.<br/>
I only hope we can hold it together until the next election. Though the Republican candidate/ new prez. will likely be just another whore, he/ she will have to come to terms with the enraged white mass of America. We will see some positive change, no matter what happens. If the country lasts that long.<br/>

		<p>Yes, the &#8220;oxymoron&#8221; point is absolutely right.</p>
<p>This is good news up to a point, if these parties can turn the widespread popular sentiment into effective votes.  This necessitates a party purge of people with criminal or undesirable histories, a coalition of agreed main aims that removes the usual competition of vain personalities and self-righteousness sectarianism, and a reserve threefold policy: &#8220;Breed like kind, secure the heritage, and master the techniques and content of the internet&#8221;.</p>
<p>In Britain the &#8220;password&#8221; among patriots is &#8220;Enoch was Right&#8221; in reference to the Conservative MP (who had his faults) who, years ago, urged a policy of Stop Immigration, Start Repatriation; he had over 80% support for this in opinion polls at one stage, but a lot of &#8220;blood&#8221; has foamed in the Thames since then, so to speak.</p>
<p>Whether a psychopathic narcissist, as I think, or a programmed asset, Breivik turned up as if on cue to soak the imminent get-together of European PEs and the anti-immigration cause in blood (of white kids); and so it is good news to think this handicap is being to some degree overcome. The Pavlov Dog imagery - K lynchings, Nazi gassings, Balkan burnings, Crusader crimes - is all our opponents still have left in their armoury, but tied to liberal media &#8220;guilt&#8221; propaganda, this stuff still has its subconscious resonance in the public mind as a brake on rational action and early outcome in government policy. Don&rsquo;t facilitate it in any way.<br/>

<p>The open-borders mentality actually makes people insane. It makes otherwise intelligent, literate people like this WSJ writer not notice that they are talking nonsense. As other commenters have pointed out, &#8220;populist extremist&#8221; is an oxymoron. </p>

		<p>Jason #11: Why don&rsquo;t Whites counter these Liberal accusations with the Soviet Purges of Orthodox Christians, and its Professional, and anti-Communist, Military Corp, of the 1930s?  </p>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t there disgust and ongoing discussions about the man-made Ukrainian Famine, where that dirtbag Stalin starved 10 million people to death? Where are their Holocaust Museums? Nowhere. </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t Whites and Christians talk about the 1.5 million Armenians that were murdered by the Ottomans, in 1915? </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t White people talk about and demand answers to why 77 million people were murdered by Mao and his Communist Thugs, in the 20th Century, in China, and where it still continues today? </p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t White people talk and protest over the two million people murdered in Cambodia, by Pol Pot and his Communist Khemer Rouge?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t White people list all the know victims of Communist Fidel Castro? The same goes for Kim Jung Il of North Korea, and of the nutbag Communists in Vietnam?  </p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t White people constantly reminding their own people, and the world, what these bloodthirsty murders have done to Humanity for over a Century? </p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t every Amren Reader, and Moderator, buy and read the book, &#8220;The Life of John Birch&#8221; by Robert H.W. Welch, Jr.? You can read how this American Army Air Corp Captain was murdered by the Chinese Communists, when he was sent to meet with them, by the US Army, at the end of the War. </p>
<p>You can then pass this book on to your children and have them all read it, to understand exactly what we are still fighting against, today, and why we must win.  </p>

		<p>The only thing that is extreme about Europeans who wish to restrict third world immigration is their wisdom, and innate understanding of racial differences.<br/>
 <br/>
In &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution,&#8221; Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending argue that the longer a population has experienced agriculture and urban living the higher its average IQ is likely to be, and the lower its crime rate.<br/>
http://goo.gl/gs1FW <br/>
 <br/>
This is because agriculture and urban living exert different population pressures than hunting and gathering. <br/>
 <br/>
The Europeans owe their high standards of living and their low crime rates to the fact that until now the great majority of them have been shaped by thousands of years of good breeding. </p>

That happens to be the MAJORITY of any population. Average lower middle and working class people make up the MAJORITY of any population.  Any politician who wants to win an election needs to cater to the MAJORITY of the population.</p>
<p>Exception should be made for the Arab and african European immigrants.  The majority of those groups are life long benefit slugs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The same goes for White women. They seem to be the downfall of our race of late. I am a White woman and I am totally ashamed of what our females have become. A head full of mush.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bravo.  I have long thought that women of any race should not be allowed to vote, serve on juries, hold any kind of public office or teach anything other than elementary school.</p>
<p>Women have been the downfall of the White race.  All it took was abotu 5 years of communist operatives like Bella Abzug and Betty Freidan to turn most White wome against the one and only race of men in the history of the world who have ever treated women with respect and equality.<br/>

Jason #11: Why don&rsquo;t Whites counter these Liberal accusations with the Soviet Purges of Orthodox Christians, and its Professional, and anti-Communist, Military Corp, of the 1930s? &#8220;</p>
<p>It started long before Stalin. Lenin established the Gulag and serveral secret police forces including the Cheka in 1919. Millions were massacred in the 1920&rsquo;s long befor Stalin became Premier.</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.  There is a reason why the communist atrocities have been covered up.  Liberals loved and still love communism.  There is another reason, but it cannot be mentioned.</p>

		<p>The real extremists write editorials for the major mass media outlets, such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.  Remember that before 911 the Wall Street Journal used to run an editorial every year calling for a Constitutional amendment stating that &#8220;There shall be open borders.&#8221;  The people in the so called &#8220;right wing extremist&#8221; parties are just ordinary people with common sense.  They seem extreme only to globalist anti-white extremists.<br/>

		<p>So which is it my anti-white, race card flashing friends?  Are they extremists or are they widely-held beliefs?  You can&rsquo;t be an extremist (meaning few share your view) while having lots of people share the same views as others.  It&rsquo;s not an extreme statement to say blacks hate whites and want us dead and to take what we have, because many feel that way in my opinion.  The &#8220;extremists&#8221; blacks today would be the Uncle Toms; the ones who work hard, are responsible, and don&rsquo;t feel the world owes them something because they&rsquo;re black. It&rsquo;s not extreme to say many whites don&rsquo;t want massive non-white (illegal) immigration to their lands because many don&rsquo;t.   </p>

<p>Free Markets and Free Enterprise built the United States into the most powerful Manufacturing Country in the world. This is how we won World War II, by outproducing the Germans and Japanese. </p>
<p>Add to the fact that our factories were out of their Bombers&rsquo; range, and we had a very secure location to build our War materials. Forget about it today. In the same situation, we couldn&rsquo;t make a good pair of boots for our Military men. </p>

		<p>It is certainly desirable to publicise atrocities committed by &#8220;leftists&#8221; and non-whites in recent decades, and in history.  It helps to neutralise guilt-inducing propaganda directed at solely at the vulnerable white western &#8220;intellectual&#8221; mentality.</p>
<p>A fairly comprehensive resource to begin with is Rudolf Rummel&rsquo;s website on Democide, containing possibly the most assiduous collection of &#8220;facts and figures&#8221; past and present, but meticulous care should be taken to avoid substantial exaggerations, which occur particularly with respect to both communist and nazi death-tolls.  Just as one could fairly dispute some accounts of German policy by Timothy Snyder in Bloodlands (2011) so one should remain sceptical about several grand totals from Steven Rosefielde in Red Holocaust (2010).</p>
<p>Competent revisionist studies many such areas should interest open-minded specialists, and for the purposes of counter-arguments the following publications provide good working material:</p>
<p>Applebaum, Anne. Gulag. Penguin. 2004. <br/>
Courtois, Stephane et al. The Black Book of Communism. Harvard UP. 1999.<br/>
Dikotter, Frank. Mao&rsquo;s Great Famine. Bloomsbury. 2011. {This author has written also on racism and eugenics in the Far East.)<br/>
 <br/>
More important perhaps in this connection than the intra-European warfare 1939-45 is the on-going &#8220;academic&#8221; onslaught against western (not only British) &#8220;colonialism&#8221;, which has the current edge of questioning the &#8220;moral&#8221; entitlement of English-speaking white &#8220;settler societies&#8221; to occupy the USA, Canada, Australia &amp; New Zealand.</p>
<p>Apart from direct rebuttal, it would be advantageous to document accurately and fully the conflicts, cruelties, crimes, colonisations and enslavements by non-white societies, past and present.  Numerous controversies arise here - see, for instance, Dr Koenraad Elst on Hindu-Muslim relations or Heath Lowry on the Armenian massacres - almost as controversial as (say) Germar Rudolf on Holocaust numbers.</p>
<p>This area of research might appeal to younger independent-minded scholars.  For a small start, try M. A. Khan, Islamic Jihad (2009)for data on one such area, as well as an example of quality research and exposition.</p>

		<p>Margaret #31: I read your posts with interest, and yes, I know that Lenin&rsquo;s hands were soaked in blood long before Joe Stalin made his way to become Premier of the USSR. </p>
<p>But Stalin is often the one they refer to when they try and make a point of how great a leader he was with his &#8220;Modernization and Collectivization of Russia&#8221; and its Farms. </p>
<p>Stalin is also the one the Liberals, Communists, and their fellow travelers use when they talk about the defeat of Hitler&rsquo;s Germany. </p>
<p>What White Western people don&rsquo;t realize, even today, is that World War II was a war between the West, and the Soviet Union impossing World Communism on all of us. Colonel Charles Lindbergh gave a speech to this affect, which you can find on You Tube. </p>
<p>Communism won that war, and the result is what we have today; the European Union, African Union, and the proposed, and creeping, North American Union. </p>
<p>As for White women bringing down the Social order in the West, my grandparents used to say the same thing, as it was happening on the News, each night. </p>
<p>I can point to an article that I read, which I will suggest that others here read as well entitled, &#8220;Communism and the Rise of Feminism&#8221;. </p>
<p>I also gained insight from reading savethemales.ca &#8220;Men Must Champion Feminine Women&#8221;, by Henry Makow. </p>
