			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), September 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Television footage showed riot police wielding clubs and beating the migrants as they jumped from a balcony near the island&rsquo;s commercial port Wednesday. The clashes came a day after migrants set their overcrowded holding centre on fire to protest Italy&rsquo;s policy of forced repatriations.</p>
<p>Some 26,000 Tunisians and 28,000 people of other nationalities from Libya have arrived in Lampedusa this year since the beginning of the Arab revolts. Italy has been sending the bulk of the Tunisians home if they don&rsquo;t qualify for political asylum, but residents on the island have complained they are being overwhelmed with migrants and are bearing the entire EU&rsquo;s immigration burden alone.</p>
<p>Clashes broke out Wednesday as some residents hurled stones at migrants who were threatening to blow up some gas canisters, news reports said. Angry residents also assaulted TV crews and other journalists covering the rioting, telling them to leave the island alone.</p>
<p>The clashes left several people injured, the reports said.</p>
<p>Lampedusa mayor Bernardino De Rubeis denounced the government for abandoning the island to cope with the chaos alone, calling the migrants &#8220;delinquents&#8221; and insisting the island wouldn&rsquo;t accept one more.</p>
<p>He said he kept a baseball bat in his office for protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must defend myself,&#8221; he was quoted as saying by ANSA. &#8220;We&rsquo;re at war, people have decided to take justice into their own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>He demanded Italian President Giorgio Napolitano come to Lampedusa &#8220;to show some solidarity with people who have been violated repeatedly&#8221; by the arrival of so many desperate migrants.</p>
<p>A Mediterranean island closer to Africa than the Italian mainland, Lampedusa has been overwhelmed this past spring by thousands of Tunisians fleeing unrest during the social upheaval at home. Tensions flared occasionally, particularly when the holding centre became overcrowded. The centre is designed to hold about 850 people but it now holds up to 1,300.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry condemned the rioting and vowed to stay the course.</p>
<p>&#8220;These episodes of unacceptable violence don&rsquo;t change our repatriation plan, which continues and will not slow down,&#8221; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The UN refugee agency warned last week that the situation at the centre was getting tense, with prolonged detentions of both Tunisians and people fleeing Libya without any moves to determine whether they might qualify for asylum.</p>
<p>It said migrants were harming themselves, staging protests and that several large groups had left on their own.</p>
<p>The UN agency urged the government to take measures to transfer the migrants from Lampedusa to more permanent centres.</p>

		<p>These people are not migrants, they are invaders who will assist in the destruction of Western society.  The so-called &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; made great promises of liberty, freedom and democracy, so just why are these people fleeing to Europe?  Maybe because the new leader of Libya views freedom and liberty similar to the way Castro did in the 1950&rsquo;s - Castro&rsquo;s freedom and democracy equated to Marxism and dictatorship; Libya&rsquo;s leaders now claim Sharia Law will be the basis for freedom in Libya. Of course, all along the leaders in the West (NATO, etc.) have cheered for this &#8220;new&#8221; democracy, when they must have known that the &#8220;Arab&#8221; Spring in reality means the &#8220;Islamic&#8221; Spring.  Still though, those that are fleeing should be returned to their own countries so they can assist in making them better.  By letting them come to the West we only prolong the rise of Islam and place our own civilization at grave risk.</p>

<p>What unrest? I thought this is what they wanted! They now have their &#8220;freedom&#8221; at home, but yet they flee to Europe - go figure!<br>
Trust me folks, by hook or crook alot of these &#8220;Tunisians fleeing unrest&#8221; will make it to the interior of Europe and from there they will be heading to this country to a neigborhood near you. Europe is just a stopping off point to catch their breath. I wonder what % of these &#8220;migrants&#8221; are terrorists? Oh well, I guess we&rsquo;ll find out soon enough.  </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re fools if they don&rsquo;t begin shuttling them by water back to the African mainland.</p>
<p>Europe is close to a tipping point right now.  I don&rsquo;t profess to know the mood of the Italian citizenry, but a little earlier they became so fed up with crime and assaults from the blacks in a couple of the villages on the mainland they formed a mob and tried to kill them.</p>
<p>The government moved the blacks to an undisclosed location.  Will it be happening again?  And again?</p>

This is one thing we all need to protest in the streets about. They hate our guts and we allow them to get away with it while taking our $$$$? We really are insane and a foolish people to the core.</p>

		<p>gosh&hellip;let me see&hellip;this island had a population of like I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;2-4 thousand? But as of August it has gone up to 48 thousand (thanks to that great Libyan leader who may or may not be in his own country)&hellip;a stopping off point for immigrants (black) to be relocated to Italy proper&hellip;that&rsquo;s nice&hellip;as the USSR&rsquo;s first leader said&hellip;&#8221;&hellip;colored peoples of the earth crawling all over the earth&#8221;&hellip;yep, that should just about do it.</p>

		<p>Banner: The ones that grabbed power in Lybia, with NATO&rsquo;s backing are the Muslim Brotherhood. They, of course, aid al Qeada, who wants to attack us, and the rest of the NATO member States. That makes sense. </p>
<p>I am always amazed when watching these people who overthrow their own Governemnts for &#8220;Freedom&#8221;, but end up leaving during or after the &#8220;Revolution&#8221; to go to Europe, where they set up their Slums. </p>
<p>They never seem to point their butts south of the Sahara, to any number of Countries. I want to know why they don&rsquo;t go to Mugabe&rsquo;s Zimbabwe, or ANC Controlled South Africa?</p>
<p>And you never see these rug rats running to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, or any other Arab Muslim Nation. No, it&rsquo;s always the &#8220;land of the Infidel&#8221;, according to them. </p>
<p>The video, &#8220;The Third Jihad&#8221; is something all traditional American, Canadian, Austrailian, and European people, especially their youth, should watch. </p>
<p>This Italian Mayor is at least on the right track. A Basball bat is a good improvised self defense weapon, or door jam, but a Shotgun, or rifle, is what he really needs to keep at hand. </p>
<p>All he has to do is ask the Swiss about how keeping their population armed, has kept their Country almost crime free, and regardless of being surrounded by large, powerful Countries, has maintained its Citizens&rsquo; liberty, while being free from Foreign invasion for over 400 years. </p>

		<p>Europe should have learned its&rsquo; lessons about letting an enemy get a beach head established in June of 1944, but it appears the lessons were lost and now, the Italians have an even more dangerous and true enemy on its&rsquo; shores who will be totally unforgiving and will change Italy forever unless the Italians resort to violence against the muslims. This is alsotrue of France and if the muslim woman that has decided to run for office and wins! it will be all over for French people</p>

I don&rsquo;t think these migrants will be getting their way at al. Indeed no.<br>
This photo (beautiful, is it not), shows it. This article, So beautiful, shows they are going to get driven out VERY HARD on the thinnest edge of the wedge, placed in a most uncomfortable spot. <br>
The Italians have begun to shudder with rage, and they will carry through.<br>
This whole multicultural horror, from Europe to the USA, is crashing, HARD and FAST.<br>
You will note the fevered pitch of the stories now carried by the most marxist media. <br>
This is GOOD NEWS, folks. Chins up.<br>
I pointed out that in Colorado, whites are getting VERY antsy&hellip;VERY uptight. We see and feel it in the air, in traffic, on the street.  Every day, friends tell me they sense that people are in a rage&hellip;on the roads, in the stores. Desperation is giving way to outbursts.  I feel it, too. It&rsquo;s an oppressive, physical force. I myself, am out of ideas. The whole thing is crumbling under the massive weight of the Mestizo tsunami. And their hordes of kids run around, playing, so happy to be slumming it up in better clothes and big bling SUVs with garish wheels&hellip;The already poisoned and messed-up Californian whites who clog this place are halfway in between steroid-viagra-monster drink rage, and being mestizo- like themselves. They are so decadent and aimless, but they too, are ticking time bombs. It is surreal. Twenty years ago&hellip;hell, Ten years ago, this was a great place, and USA Today ranked Coorado Springs as the #1 city to live in. <br>
Huh! No one is claiming that anymore. Barrios everywhere, four foot- five mixtecs  lumber about everywhere, bullets fly, black thugs pop off caps like firecrackers, hardened prison Mestizo gangs prowl the streets day and night. easily 1/2 of this county, the largest in the state, is either unpleasant, or verging on a no go zone. The whites who live in these areas are so degraded, so uptight or downtrodden.<br>
There&rsquo;s no way to describe how close to LA of 20 years ago, this place now looks like.<br>
And again, the job base has been laid flat. Opportunities for whites with families are as rare as unicorns. The storm is brewing, fast.<br>
It&rsquo;s like a natural force; like the formation of a summer storm; put the right elements in force, and it just explodes. Only so much energy gets compressed, before it must be discharged. Laws of physics, folks. <br>
A bit scary, but necessary. <br>
It is coming, maybe very soon.<br>
Don&rsquo;t be a defeatist. The third world horde, and their white enablers/ vampires, have far overplayed their hand. And just as with our collapsing economy, where you can&rsquo;t see all the damage done until much of it is in play, then you connect the dots, this marxist third world invasion is much farther into collapse than we could have known.<br>
Here it comes.</p>

		<p>These illegal immigrants are going to Europe to get the goodies, pure and simple.  The prime goal for many is the U.K. with its generous and easily obtained welfare.  <br>
From what I&rsquo;ve read, Khadafi kept many of these people from leaving Libya for Italy.  When the West turned on him, he opened the floodgates.  And many of these invaders are sub-Saharans who couldn&rsquo;t care less about Libya, sharia, or any other law or Arab country.  When they weren&rsquo;t immediately allowed to head for the European mainland, they responded by setting fires.  <br>
Europe&rsquo;s history of ethnic toleration is very recent, and the concept isn&rsquo;t shared by a large percentage of the common people.  The far right is much stronger there than in the U.S., and the politicians are well aware of it.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s this bunk about Tunisians fleeing unrest?  All the &#8220;migrants&#8221; I see fighting with the police are black Africans. They are not legitimate refugees but economic freeloaders seeking welfare benefits or menial jobs in unemployment strapped Italy. Send in the Italian Navy and ship them all back to Africa. Make Lampedusa mayor Bernardino De Rubeis the new head of Italy&rsquo;s Department of Eurozone Immigration.</p>

		<p>To anonymous 24. Getting facts straight is critically important for credibility. The Greeks started Western Civilization. None of us would be here without them. The Romans, or as you call them, Latins, conquered Greece, but understood that Greek culture was superior. They Hellenized the the Western world.</p>

		<p>the most disgusting thing i have ever seen was the election of a racist supposedly black but actually mulatto person as president and his destruction of america but it is doubly disgusting that this rodent is bringing about the destruction of italy</p>

		<p>There is an African saying that began in the 1960&rsquo;s when they got their &#8220;freedom&#8221; from evil Europeans.  </p>
<p>&#8220;One man one vote, just once&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s African and Arab democracy.  George Soros financed and arranged all these revolts.  For some reason he is anti Israel.<br>
The plan is that these new goverments will attack Israel.</p>
<p>Then I suppose there will be a new invasion of Europe by not ony the muslim nations but by millions of subsahrans.</p>

		<p>I disagree with 12  &mdash;  Anonymous who argues that Switzerland is safe and crime free because their government encourages residents to have guns:</p>
<p>12- Anonymous writes:<br>
&#8220;All he has to do is ask the Swiss about how keeping their population armed, has kept their Country almost crime free, and regardless of being surrounded by large, powerful&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack responds:</p>
<p>Somalia and the population of Detroit have lots and lots of guns - and these places are hardly safe or crime free.</p>
<p>The key issues are racial/cultural - not some particular laws about guns or taxation rates.</p>
<p>All White societies are going to be very safe and crime free whether they are hyper Liberal/Left like 1970s Sweden or Conservative Right like Switzerland/New Hampshire.</p>
<p>We have to start thinking with our blood and not think intellectual ideas about economics or gun rights will save us.</p>

<p>I wonder what circle of hell Lampedusa now qualifies as? The tide is going to turn; and right soon. The writing is on the wall, and it is for all good and righteous men to pay attention. <br>
Personally I am betting on something within a close order of one year at most.<br>
Canned food, wool army blankets, brass &amp; lead, gold &amp; silver.<br>
Just suggesting you all be ready, because the trend lines all point dramatically downward.</p>

		<p>Olewhitelady and Sardonicus are correct.  And almost nobody knows about this Lampedusa debacle in the U.S.  I&rsquo;ve seen the story online but not elsewhere, and only on &#8220;conservative&#8221; websites, at that.  Anonymous #15 points out what&rsquo;s fairly comparative and it scares me.  It should scare everyone.  I know for a fact it scares my family and a good deal of my friends but since they&rsquo;re Euro/whites they&rsquo;re even more afraid to speak up, even to each other.  The illegals are here to get the goodies.  Each and every one of them.  If there were not goodies in Europe nor America for them, they wouldn&rsquo;t come.  Lampedusa should let them starve.  And in my opinion, we should let our illegal immigrants in the US do the same.  Instead, we look the other way when they operate illegal businesses and then we give them everything they need to survive on top of it.  We are seriously messed up in this country.  God help us.</p>

		<p>&#8220;These hordes don&rsquo;t look like Tunisians or North Africans but clearly Sub-Saharan Africans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, judging from the all the close up pictures I&rsquo;ve seen of the rioters, they seem to be almost exclusively North Africans with very few blacks.</p>

		<p>At this point in history only a take over by the  Italian Military can reestablish law and order in Italy because neither the President nor the Prime Minister have shown any strong will against this daily third world invasion and destruction of Italy.<br>
What they doing it&rsquo;s only patching up here and there. </p>

		<p>As the economies of the West crash the natives are going to blame the immigrants and start slaughtering them. Their representatives are going to try to stop it but will be overwhelmed by the numbers.<br>
 I think the war will be brutal but short.</p>

		<p>When money is short tolerance of all things foreign diminishes. A financial crisis can have a beneficial cleansing effect. Being white without shame as an idea is just around the corner.</p>
