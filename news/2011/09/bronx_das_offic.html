<h1>Bronx DA&rsquo;s Office Declines to Prosecute Alarming Number of Cases, Probe Finds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kevin Deutsch, NY Daily News, September 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The best place to get arrested in the city is the Bronx.</p>
<p>Hands down.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the Bronx district attorney&rsquo;s office declines to prosecute an alarming number of cases, a Daily News probe found.</p>
<p>Prosecutors toss cases at twice the rate of the citywide average  &mdash;  and more than three times the rate of their counterparts in Manhattan and Brooklyn, stats show.</p>
<p>Cops who make the collars are fed up with the trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get away with anything in the Bronx,&#8221; fumed one cop. &#8220;They&rsquo;re letting dangerous people back out on the street again and again, instead of making even the slightest effort to build a case against them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson&rsquo;s office threw out 17.3% of the 43,520 arrests between Jan. 1 and July 22 of this year, state Division of Criminal Justice Services records show.</p>
<p>His prosecutors have led the city in rejected cases every year since 2006, despite handling fewer arrests than Manhattan and Brooklyn, records show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The overall 17.3% rejection rate is more than twice the citywide average of 8.4%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If your case isn&rsquo;t something close to a slam dunk, you can&rsquo;t hold onto it,&#8221; one assistant district attorney said. &#8220;It makes it a frustrating place to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the past month, the Bronx district attorney&rsquo;s office declined to prosecute a number of disturbing crimes.</p>
<p>Among them:</p>
<blockquote>- A crazed woman slashed a man in his stomach, but dodged attempted murder charges because of an uncooperative victim. A cop source said prosecutors did &#8220;less than nothing&#8221; to gain his trust.
<p>- Officers found two men sitting on a park bench reeking of pot with a large bag of crack cocaine at their feet. Prosecutors deemed there was not enough evidence to prove the drugs belonged to them, records show.</blockquote></p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Sounds like NYC is once again near the edge of out-of-control. Perhaps these efforts by the prosecutor are actually efforts to keep things from spilling over.  </p>

		<p>Many years ago when I worked for a firm that handled medical malpractice cases (we defended the doctors and hospitals), plaintiffs&rsquo; attorneys were always trying to get their cases venued in the Bronx. They&rsquo;d name everybody they could think of who had even set eyes on the patient, including the janitor, to get a case tried in the Bronx. The population up there is not considered too bright and will always go with the plaintiff, especially if the plaintiff is a minority. Big awards, too.</p>
<p>So this story doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. Hey, it&rsquo;s the Bronx!  </p>

		<p>We KNOW why this is happening.  Black DA won&rsquo;t prosecute a &#8220;brutha&#8221; unless not prosecuting would be so egregious as to warrant his impeachment or removal.  Another affirmative action appointment no doubt.  After all, who can understand black criminals more than a black man;  who can understand black students better than a black teacher;  etc.  Which comes down to mean - incompetent, basing decisions on race alone, any criticism of the black inept teacher, supervisor, DA, President is of course &#8220;racisss&#8221; even if the person is totally inept, a liar of the first order, crooked and corrupt, in over his head, and just plain lazy or unwilling to place ANY responsibility on another black for crimes, non-performance, or sheer laziness.<br>

		<p>Any time blacks are in charge of prosecuting criminals, it&rsquo;s like putting the fox in charge of the hen house. <br>
Atlanta, Ga is a very good place to commit a crime, the DA&rsquo;s office there &#8220;loses&#8221; hundreds of crimes monthly. <br>
Just look at the criminality that is going on now in Washington, DC. </p>

		<p>I suspect this DA is just facing the fact that the Black Perp knows he can demand a jury trial, and the all-Black jury will acquit no matter what he has done.  Of course no one can say that.</p>

		<p>What about the plain old vanilla ice cream fact that a whole<br>
lot of police and detectives  &mdash;  perhaps moreso in the Bronx?  &mdash;  <br>
just don&rsquo;t do efficient work and when they have to show up in Court to defend their work, they make &#8220;Exhibits&#8221; of themselves??</p>

		<p>Same thing happens all the time in the courts of Memphis, TN all the time. Even worse than throwing out the cases is blatant favoritism shown toward black defendants by allowing them to plea bargains for violent crimes and ignoring mandatory minimum sentences for using a firearm in the commission of a felony.    </p>

		<p>Wait until we a minority everywhere in this land.  Then we will be marching and shouting, &#8220;No justice, no peace.&#8221;  The only problem is that there will not be an educated, liberal, kumbaya crowd of blacks and latinos who will call for equal rights for whites.</p>

		<p>I live in NYC, and it seems like black kids in particular are getting more and more brazen and the police more and reluctant to do anything. A few weeks ago black kids were throwing rocks at cyclists, bloodied one who needed stitches (if he didnt&rsquo; have a helmet he would have had serious injury. The police were reluctant to take a report, and pushed it on the other precinct, who said it wasn&rsquo;t their job.<br>
Is it pressure from Holder? (too many blacks arrested =racism)  or just resources at the breaking point?? </p>

		<p>Another thought here: if cases are being dropped, then what does this do to the crime stats re crimes committed by minorities as opposed to those committed by whites?</p>

		<p>The point of #7 is that neither the prosecutor nor the judge wishes to see a case brought to court if the investigation and evidence is tainted or is of such poor quality as to make conviction unlikely.  A group of detectives needs to have a fairly good average group IQ to be able to get a prosecution onto the runway, let along into the air. And in police work especially,<br>
dumb beget dumb.  It&rsquo;s lots easier and rewarding to work in a bright PD than in a dull one.  </p>

		<p>Looks like cops in the Bronx are working for nothing. Now &hellip;. Let&rsquo;s take a stroll to good old San Diego Ca. Here we have a &#8220;Proud to be Gay&#8221; DA named Bonnie Dumanis who protects dirty lawyers, and the percentage of prosecution is as rare as hen&rsquo;s teeth. Case in point is an Disbarred Attorney with the name of Patricia Ann Gregory of Carlsbad Ca who is getting away with stealing two former clients life savings of over $112,000.00!!! And our GAY DA is ignoring the facts of the Cal State Bar Court who have already disbarred this attorney.</p>
