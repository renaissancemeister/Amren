<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The ranks of multiracial Americans grew fastest in the states that most recently had laws on the books outlawing interracial marriage, the U.S. Census Bureau said yesterday.</p>
<p>Nine of the 10 states where the percentage of multiracial white Americans climbed the most were in the South, where interracial marriages were banned before a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court decision declared a Virginia prohibition unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Multiracial Americans who are partially white increased by at least 8 percent in every state in the nation from 2000 to 2010. The number of people who described themselves as white multiracial Americans climbed 112 percent in South Carolina, 111 percent in North Carolina, 93 percent in Georgia, and 81 percent in Mississippi, the bureau reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The largest percentage of multiracial Americans are white and black, the Census Bureau said. Americans who described themselves as a combination of white and black races made up almost a quarter of the nation&rsquo;s 9 million multiracial residents. Multiracial Americans make up 2.9 percent of the population, up from 2.4 percent in 2000, the first time Americans were allowed to describe themselves to the government as members of more than one race.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A separate analysis by William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who has studied census data for more than three decades, looked at just those who considered themselves white and black. He found that number also grew fastest in South Carolina, increasing to 27,432 from 7,890, or 247.7 percent. Nationwide, the number of multiracial Americans who were a combination of white and black rose to 1.8 million, more than doubling from the 2000 tally of 784,764, Frey reported, calling it &#8220;a historic change.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All 11 states in the Deep South, plus Oklahoma, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri and West Virginia had anti-miscegenation laws overturned by the ruling. The case was sparked by a white man and black woman who married in 1958 in the District of Columbia, then attempted to live in Virginia. Their sentence was suspended by a judge on the condition that Richard and Mildred Loving leave the state for 25 years. The couple moved to Washington, then sued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almighty God created the races, white, black, yellow, Malay, and red and placed them on separate continents, and but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages,&#8221; the judge wrote.</p>

		<p>No surprise. I was taken aback by the amount of racemixing I discovered when I moved to the South from California. I can&rsquo;t speak on all of the South  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s a huge, diverse region  &mdash; , but where I live you would be hard pressed to find a White person who doesn&rsquo;t have a mulatto nephew, niece, cousin, grandchild, etc. And increasingly White girls are having children by Mexican Indians and mestizos.</p>

		<p>More agit-prop from the left. The insinuation here is that native white Southerners are jumping racial boundaries in record numbers. These statistics don&rsquo;t mention that more people from other regions have moved to the South than any other part of the country. Most of these &#8220;Southerners&#8221; have no connection whatsoever with Dixie. They are just interlopers who side with the blacks against Southern history and culture. Their most profound expression of contempt for the South is to have sex with blacks. </p>
<p>True, there is an element of native white trash in the South who are generally of low intelligence and who will cohabitate with blacks. But what decent white person would want them for a mate anyway?</p>

		<p>A 247% increase in a decade seems to be more indicative of a change in how people are reporting their ancestry, rather than a substantial demographic shift.  The same goes for the supposed doubling of mulattos.</p>
<p>There hasn&rsquo;t been a massive surge in the number of mixed people born/residing in these states. I&rsquo;d wager every penny I own on it being due to a very slight actual number increase, and then a large increase in people reporting their ancestry more accurately then they had before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans who described themselves as a combination of white and black races made up almost a quarter of the nation&rsquo;s 9 million multiracial residents.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we want to be technical, then 9 out of 10 American &#8220;blacks&#8221; are multiracial, as they&rsquo;re all 10-25% white, give or take.  Though as far as &#8220;multiracial white Americans,&#8221; go, there is no such thing.  You&rsquo;re either white, black, or mixed.  You cannot be all three.</p>
<p>The article title is most amusing.  &#8220;Kids&#8221; seeing a surge?  At no point is age mentioned among the demographic statistics cited, and in fact the people quoted tend to support what I said above.  Case in point - </p>

 This isn&rsquo;t surprising at all. There are a ton more blacks in southern states with the exception of WV and KY.  The problem with these states is whites and blacks often share the same residential turf, schools, public facilities etc. This regular, close and historical contact between the races has always set the stage for some level of misogyny. Of course it&rsquo;s much worse now, with the dismantling of formal segregation. </p>
<p> When I lived in SC several years ago I saw &#8220;way more&#8221; examples of this and it angered me greatly. Enough so, that I eventually returned to my much more segregated non- urban north, where this isn&rsquo;t as prevalent or, socially accepted.</p>

		<p>Regardless of whether I personally like it or not, race-mixing is their choice.  I just worry about the fact that usually their offspring will assimilate downward and act like the worst on both sides. </p>
<p>If blacks would just act civilized, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it so much.  Where I am, there are a lot of people with ghetto attitudes who were lured up to the high desert by Section 8 and other welfare goodies, and the result hasn&rsquo;t been pleasant.  </p>

		<p>I once had a self-hating white friend who used to say that he wasn&rsquo;t white, he was Spanish, as if the two were exclusive.  </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no double-checking of the answers people give on affirmative action or census forms; could it be possible that the white guilt has gotten so unbearable in some people that they&rsquo;re looking for excuses to check something other than &#8220;white&#8221; on the form?</p>
<p>Also, this article seems to imply that this signifies a much wider acceptance of miscegenation in the South, but I&rsquo;ll bet a good number of these people have moved to the South, they&rsquo;re not from there.</p>

		<p>And how does all of this improve the financial problems of our country? People have got their heads in the clouds about the magical wonders of diversity and bored journalists are writing gushy, nauseating articles about how great it is that we&rsquo;ve got millions of happy biracial kids crawling around. But more jobs are being lost  &mdash;  in even greater numbers to the very people we&rsquo;re mixing with  &mdash;  the Obama administration continues to spend spend spend and drive us into further debt, and the border states struggle to contain illegal immigration. China, the country which has a strong uniform conformist culture and people, I&rsquo;m afraid, will have no trouble outdoing the U.S. in every aspect of civilization.</p>

		<p>Not so surprising since white kids have been made to feel that they are white trash, and being black is so cool.  So the poorer white kids find acceptability by being black and having black children.  It only means that to some extent, the propaganda is working.  But I would predict that most of the cases are white females who paired with a black, and then were left alone with children.  I think this is far greater the case.  Among the better off whites, the young use blacks as sex toys, but not serious long term relationships.  Of course, a number of them are damaged along the way as well.</p>

		<p>Now we are supposed to become familiar and accepting of the term, &#8220;multiracial white.&#8221;  This requires a certain brand of functional illiteracy and of course, this is what is constantly being pushed, this type of illiteracy.  You are either white or you aren&rsquo;t, period.</p>

<p>Considering the 24/7/365 pro-miscegenation propaganda on TV, these numbers could be much worse.  I credit implicit whiteness.  I think it is also quite likely that those whites who decide to &#8220;mix-it-up&#8221; rank on the low side of the IQ scale.</p>

<p>Excellent question. I&rsquo;m from the South and I can&rsquo;t count the number of times I&rsquo;ve seen mixed children with their White grandparents. Either the grandparents are raising them, or their White daughters have moved back in as well with their mixed child after the black father has abandoned them.</p>
<p>I know personally, I&rsquo;ve never been shy expressing my opinion to my own children how I feel about race mixing. They know if they choose to go down that road, I&rsquo;ll have no part of it. I want White grandchildren that look like our ancestors before us, and I&rsquo;d say 90% of other races do as well, but I&rsquo;m sure any &#8220;anti-racists&#8221; lurking here on AR would call be a big bad bigot. Yeah, yeah, blah blah blah&hellip;save it for someone who cares.</p>

		<p>A significant factor in this development must be the predominant entertainment culture, especially &#8220;music&#8221; videos which put attractive usually blonde white girls in provocative contact with numbers of black &#8220;bling&#8221; and &#8220;gangstaz&#8221; types, and the media spin-off from sports in which black achievers have white trophy wives or girl-friends. Whereas in past years it was the &#8220;trash&#8221; on both sides who mated, in an age of intellectual, cultural and moral decadence, where trash-values are normative, it is a growing phenomenon, and genetically irreversible if and when it turns out badly. Whites need to marry and reproduce their own kind. Abraham Lincoln and Marcus Garvey had the right idea in this respect.</p>

		<p>I live in a small town in Michigan that is more than 95% white.  Recently I was in a McDonald&rsquo;s and seated by the play area was a white woman, a white man I presumed to be her boyfriend, and two mulatto children.  Another time I saw a dwarf woman pushing a stroller with a mulatto baby seated inside, walking with a white man.  &#8220;What&rsquo;s love got to do with it?,&#8221; sang Tina Turner.  In many cases of black-white marriage, precious little.    </p>

		<p>I highly doubt this. It&rsquo;s the most obvious propaganda to claim that the sole region that resisted the social changes of the 1950s-1960s would be the one to embrace mullatoization. Because if Mississippi will look like Barack Obama within two generations, why not Maine? Or Rhode Island?</p>
<p>And how many of those &#8220;whites&#8221; are actually from Latin America?</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t owned a TV for several years now, so I find it interesting that some people have mentioned that there&rsquo;s now a constant glamourization of miscegenation on TV. One of the reasons why I don&rsquo;t have a TV is because there&rsquo;s so much anti-white programming on. For those who haven&rsquo;t yet done it, living without a TV is well-worth considering, along with other anti-white media like today&rsquo;s movies. I know it seems hard to imagine at first, as I once spent most evenings watching TV. However, if the anti-white programming no longer gets enough viewers to attract advertisers, it will soon be off the air. And spending the evening with a good book or website is much better than watching something offensive. The constant media promotion of miscegenation is probably one of the reasons why so many young people no longer think anything of it, and too many of them are learning what harm it brings too late.</p>

		<p> A lot of whites are running away from the &#8220;white &#8221; label. They have come to realize that with affirmative action, quotas, set asides and the other advantages of being black that their children will have it much easier in the coming years.<br/>
 The black leaders are determined that these programs are to continue indefinitely. The laws enacted against the white race is the like the Jim Crow laws of the past.The biggest difference is that no in power today or in the foreseeable future have any intentions of changing them.<br/>
 Maybe in 7 or 8 generations when the white race is decimated the laws will change or the ruling will be so ingrained in the culture it will simply be accepted as the norm.</p>

		<p>I spent a decade in Georgia and Louisiana trying to convince myself that all these gals with Golden Children were newcomers.  Not true.  Now that I live in South Carolina and work closer to people, I see that most of these females are locals from the lower middle class and below.  They all speak with a magnolia whine.  But about every tenth one is a middle class beauty who is publicly crawling all over her stocky, gang-banger dressed, loading dock quality guy.  It does not make sense, aesthetically, socially, or culturally.  I have never seen a place where females are marrying down in droves, both to whites and to blacks.  I suspect that many of those who stare in disbelief are newcomers, both Northerners and Asian.  </p>
<p>Driving through neighborhoods, I also see grey-headed grandmothers having to walk their little brown grandchildren.  What a psychological cataclysm these poor people must have gone thought to see the fears of the fifties coming true, in their own families.  Something that cannot be undone.</p>
<p>I know this much.  It&rsquo;s everywhere.  And, most amazingly, there is a region-wide &ldquo;oath of silence.&rdquo;  Nobody dares utter a syllable.</p>
<p>Apparently blacks also talk about this among themselves.  Maya Angelou says many blacks claim it&rsquo;s all about sex.  But, she disagrees. She then says something that makes sense.  If the white gal is a nympho, then why should she saddle herself with a husband and five children when she could be running wild every night?  Naturally, she wants to think it&rsquo;s all about true love.  I suspect she&rsquo;s right in a lot of cases, even if it is a strange type of love.  When you have seen some white female (who only recently wouldn&rsquo;t give a black the time of day) suddenly go into a dreamy-eyed funk for months on end over some ugly little character, all you can do is shake your head.  It doesn&rsquo;t make sense.  It&rsquo;s as if some strange new psychology has been unleashed by unknown forces.</p>
<p>People do notice it.  They also know they&rsquo;ll be smashed by the local newspaper, the nieces and nephews, etc., if they dare say a word.  Sometimes, they&rsquo;ll get up the nerve to ask a friend, &ldquo;Uh…have you noticed around here that…?&rdquo;  Yes, friend, everybody has noticed.<br/>

		<p>The percentage of Multiracials in this country is a lot higher than 2% when you factor in the the fact that most Hispanics in the U.S are a Multiracial mix of African and Spanish in the East (Florida, New York, New Jersey, etc) and a Multiracial mix of Native American and Spanish in the West/Southwest (California, Arizona, New Mexico, etc).</p>
<p>But most of these Multiracial Hispanics in the U.S are counted as &#8220;White&#8221; by the U.S census bureau and F.B.I criminal statistics.</p>
<p>The real percentage of Multiracials in the U.S is atleast 30% because most Hispanics are not pure Spanish and most African Americans are not pure African.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s still the lower class that propagates this birthrate.  No matter what propaganda the media tries to push, a white woman with black kids is seen as low class.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been in a store and heard what I thought was a loud black woman only to see a white woman with black children in tow.  You never see upper middle class white girls with black children.  </p>

		<p>Most of these people are probably bored, small town teenagers and young adults in their early twenties. They&rsquo;ve probably known these blacks all their lives, are very familiar with them, and decide that being risky one time won&rsquo;t do any damage. I doubt they were seeking a long term relationship with a black male/female. They figure that it&rsquo;s socially acceptable enough to have a go but they don&rsquo;t think of the consequences. I bet some of the blacks do though.</p>

		<p>I was recently in the deep South at a resort on the Gulf Coast. The clientle was mostly working class white familes, and a small number of black families. They were mostly decent people. I did not see any problems or conflicts. There was one mixed race couple: an slightly overweight black man with an overweight white, blond woman. They couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands off of each other. They were physically all over each other in the pool, as if to scream, &#8220;look at me! look at me!&#8221;. It was offensive to everyone, both black and white. No other couple needed to carry on like that outside of their room&hellip;it was the mixed race couple that had to shove their sex life down everyone&rsquo;s throat. They could not be simply a normal couple. They had to be deliberately shocking while pushing an agenda on everyone.  If it were in some sleazy nightclub, it would be their business&hellip;.but they had to carry on like that in front of children. </p>

		<p>Some mixed race children look beautiful, like Halle Berre, etc. Some look horrifying, and would be rejected by both races. Why even risk such a thing?  Many mixed race couples are turned on the the novelty and their own selfishness.  When the novelty fades, you are left with reality: extremely different, often incompatible cultures, and outcast multiracial children.</p>

		<p>Look at the advertisements in every magazine in America.  Look at the commercials on TV.  Look at the images on billboards.  Most of the time you have black male/white female pairings.  The message is anything but subtle.  It&rsquo;s telling white girls that &#8216;you need a black man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help things that most young white girls have a false sense of freedom - that they can go with any black thug and that they will be &#8216;respected&rsquo; and not pressured.  The syndrome of the clueless white girl jogging at night in an urban area, and who can&rsquo;t understand how it was that she just got raped, is rampant these days.</p>
<p>Have you also ever wondered why the black male/white female pairing is always with a blond girl?  In the ads it&rsquo;s a skinny, pretty blond.  In real life it&rsquo;s mostly an obese, low esteem white blond girl.  I have yet to see a black guy with a white woman with black hair.</p>

		<p>For some odd reason, few people posting here provide the exact location and name of the town they are talking about.  Where in &#8220;South Carolina?&#8221;  Where in the &#8220;Deep South?&#8221;  Why the anonymity regarding the exact location?  It&rsquo;s one thing if you want your name to remain anonymous, but what&rsquo;s the need to conceal the geographic name of the area in question?  If we&rsquo;re to put our fingers on trends social phenomena, we have to know more than a general area.  </p>
<p>Hailing from the capital district of New York (Albany, Saratoga, Schenectady), I can see more miscegenation in lower class, post- industrial cities than in trendy liberal enclaves of suburbia.  Places like Amsterdam, Albany, Troy, Gloversville and Schenectady are increasingly black and mestizo/Spanish mulatto, so the residual whites, who are very low class and unable to escape, end up mixing with the minorities.  I think this trend is common across America.</p>
<p>Saratoga and other upper class outlying areas have less mixing.</p>
<p>Regarding the comment on US Military bases, (post #8) the military has always been a magnet for lower class white girls who readily mix with minorites, not to mention dimwitted, sex-starved white men who readily marry Asian prostitutes.  The ugly Filipino prostitutes I&rsquo;ve seen married to handsome, young military personnel really make me wonder what the men are thinking.  These girls are the ugliest and lowest class members of their societies.  This suits the military fine as such types usually stay 20 years and readily accept the military&rsquo;s mind control.</p>

		<p><i>You never see upper middle class white girls with black children.</i></p>
<p>With celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Madonna adopting foreign children of other races, it&rsquo;s become trendy to adopt black children.  In some cases, having one of these kids is like having the latest fashion accessory.  Since the adoption process is very expensive, typically only upper middle class and upper class people can afford to jump through all of the required hoops.  After the recent disaster in Haiti, a lot of whites (many of whom were affiliated with Christian church groups) adopted or attempted to adopt orphaned Haitian children too because no one else was stepping up to take care of them.  It will be interesting to see what happens to these kids when they get older and the trendiness has worn off.</p>

<p>Any area with large number of Asians and Whites living together result in most White men marrying Asian women. I&rsquo;ve worked in large companies with many highly educated white men in engineering fields, more than half are married to Asian women. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And have you considered why this is so? IMO, White women have simply lost the ability to compete for high quality men. They have been taught that competing for mates is in a sense &#8216;degrading&rsquo; or &#8216;beneath them&rsquo; and so they instead focus on &#8216;finding themselves&rsquo; or whatever. Asian women tend to be more realistic, and more feminine, on average. </p>

What Don said about Germans and Italians, post 25, still having pride. I truly agree with him. I&rsquo;m originally from western PA. When I lived in Georgia for a time, I saw more race mixing between blacks and whites than up here. Socioeconomic reasons have much to do with this as some posters have stated. It&rsquo;s real simple, a higher percentage of low income whites is obviously proportional to lower income behavior. Unfortunately, this behavior now includes race mixing and breeding. But then again, this socioeconomic observation doesn&rsquo;t seem nearly as common up north. I personally know and have run into many people throughout PA, NY, VT and NH who might be lower middle income, but surprisingly well educated, mannered and have a sense of dignity. They just chose to live a more modest existence. Sure, we have our share of white trash, but it seems more limited in scope than what I witnessed in the south. Lower income White southerners by comparison, seem to wear their lower status on their sleeves and it shows. This caused me to become a little dissapointed during my stay in Georgia.</p>

<p>Sorry, don&rsquo;t agree.  My personal assessment of &#8220;yellow-hauling&#8221; white men is that they&rsquo;re mostly incapable of having a real relationship with a real woman, a white woman, because they don&rsquo;t want to have a real give-and-take relationship, they want to have their way all the time.  They gravitate toward Asian women because they know Asian women won&rsquo;t say no or disagree with any vigor.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t surprising at all. There are a ton more blacks in southern states with the exception of WV and KY. The problem with these states is whites and blacks often share the same residential turf, schools, public facilities etc. This regular, close and historical contact between the races has always set the stage for some level of misogyny. Of course it&rsquo;s much worse now, with the dismantling of formal segregation. </p>

I hear you. But what you fail to mention is that many if not most of the white men with asian wives/girlfriends really have no choice. It is the white female that has abandoned the white male (at least the good ones; decent, law abiding financially successful white males who do not have tattoos and go to bars and get into fights).

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed more than my fair share of miscegenation of late. Primarily of the black/white variety. There were a lot of WM/AF pairings when I was in the Navy, and more often than not, the women were the grappling hook to get the family to the US; especially if they were Filipino. </p>
<p>What is it like to be the grandparent of a mulatto and try to reconcile yourself with what your son/daughter has done? My wife&rsquo;s cousin is married to a man of Chinese ancestry. Both are college educated professionals and are reasonably well off financially. However, I can imagine that both sets of parents had long discussions with them before they got married. Since this cousin and her husband have children in elementary school, the Rubicon was crossed a long time ago. </p>
<p>If they were married prior to Loving vs. Virginia, how would a Southern state have reacted if they came to visit? WM/AF pairings were generally given a free pass (especially around military bases) but what if the case were AM/WF? I have met people who would now be in their early 50&rsquo;s who have white fathers and asian mothers. Certainly this was illegal under (some) state laws in 1960. Generally, they were considered &#8220;honorary&#8221; whites. </p>
<p>When I attended high school, one did not date across color lines without serious repercussions. I never saw a WM/BF pairing in four years. The couple of BM/WF pairings made the girl an instant outcast. The only exception was our two half Asians (mom was a Korean War Bride). They were in classes with the white kids (and they acted like whites). Both are now married to white spouses. </p>
<p>Personally I am not a fan of interracial marriage, although I would not make it outright illegal. With current technology, you now use DNA analysis to determine that someone was 1/128th Indian and therefore violates the &#8220;one drop rule&#8221; even though they have blond hair and blue eyes? </p>

		<p>The following brief selections come from The Sunday Times (London) October 2,2011. Headlined &#8220;Lucky Britain&rsquo;s mixed-up future&#8221; is an article by George Alaghiah, a prominent Sri Lankan BBC presenter starting a 3-part TV series called &#8220;Mixed Britannia&#8221;. In 1984 &#8220;unconcerned about the challenges&#8221; of their &#8220;different heritage and colourhe married an English woman. [Brackets are inserted below against questionable assertions.]<br/>
  &#8220;In London - indeed, in any [?] of our great cities - mixed-race relationships are so common that it would be strange to notice them at all&hellip;. Mixed-race children make up one of the fastest growing and youngest ethnic [?] minorities in Britain.<br/>
According to some census experts, the number of mixed-race people will double between 2001 and 2020 [to] about 1.3m people&hellip;. Cardiff University&rsquo;s school of psychology found that mixed-race people came closest to modern notions of what it takes to be attractive&hellip;. The professor in charge of the study suggests that those taking part&hellip;may have stumbled, subliminally, across what Charles Darwin once called &#8216;hybrid vigour&rsquo;[?].<br/>
 &#8220;Yet it is not so long ago that to be born mixed race in Britain was to carry a burden of shame and opprobrium&hellip;. In the 1940s, the children born to white women and black GIs&hellip;were described as &#8216;war casualties&rsquo;&hellip;my brother-in-law, Tony Martin, was one of them&hellip;he&rsquo;s as British as they come. On our last holiday to Sri Lanka together, he insisted on Marmite and toast for breakfast while the rest of us enjoyed the local fare - buffalo milk curd and kitul pani&hellip;.<br/>
 &#8220;Mixed Britannia is&hellip;about Britishness - that elusive quality that we all [?] understand instinctively&hellip;.  There were - and are - plenty of racists, but they have never been allowed to gain the foothold they did elsewhere. Somehow we have muddled through to where we are today, a country largely at ease with its rainbow people.  Given what is happening elsewhere [?] that is something to be proud of.&#8221;<br/>
  The BBC Press Office has further information on its website.<br/>
  <br/>
  This is not the occasion to critique Dr Michael Lewis&rsquo;s upturned pyramid of non sequitur and wishful thinking resting on his Cardiff &#8220;study&#8221;, such as his reference to Lewis Hamilton&rsquo;s racing success, etc.  <br/>
  See also:www.intermix.org.uk/news/news_040510_03.asp<br/>
           www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101209074405.htm</p>
<p>  Official figures indicate that about 1.1% of the British population are presently &#8220;mixed race&#8221;. Nearly half the males of Caribbean heritage now have partners of another race.  Ditto, one in five black African men, 39% of Chinese women, and one in ten Indians. From the white population itself, 4% of women and 3% of men have an inter-ethnic relationship. <br/>
  Yet of children, one in five belongs to an ethnic minority and nearly 10% already live in an ethnically mixed household. For some of us this trend is not so &#8220;lucky&#8221;.</p>

<p>Miscegenation, not misogyny.  And, yeah, it&rsquo;s close contact and, much more importantly, the public school system.  It&rsquo;s why those who must remain unnamed were and still are so adamant about desegregation.  School&rsquo;s like work, you spend most of your time there or getting ready to be there.  I kinda think that, the desegregated close contact, is one of the reasons for calls to expand the school year.  It&rsquo;s been noted that it works.</p>

<p>I guess black men opt for the &#8220;most white&#8221; woman whether she&rsquo;s beautiful or not. White woman with brown or black hair is not enough &#8220;white&#8221; for him because he wants his children to look as least black as possible. <br/>
Many would go for a fat, ugly white trash woman instead of attractive, slim, &#8220;normal&#8221; behaving black woman.</p>
<p>Argumentum e contrario, it&rsquo;s true for black or Asian woman too, many would jump on a random white man, regardless of his atractiveness&hellip; If you watch out, no Asian girl date Southern European men. Among such pairs, the men are North European, with blond, red or light brown hair with light eyes, almost without exception.</p>

		<p>The thrust of many comments here are, once again, that northern whites are superior to southern whites.  That is, whites up north are less trashy and more prideful of their race.</p>
<p>A true test of the statistics would be to draw samples north and south and equalize that sample along black-white ratio and socioeconomic status.  Likely there would be no difference in race-mixing percentages between the two.</p>
<p>Over the years I did a lot of work in the Green Mountain State.  On my first trip I was shocked to see a picture on the front page of the local paper of a cute blond girl snuggled up with a Somalia male.  They can&rsquo;t get enough of their Somalia&rsquo;s it seems. </p>
<p>Upon talking to the locals and my peers in the Vermont work group, it became apparent many had never been around blacks and didn&rsquo;t know their general character.  Many of these &#8220;educated&#8221; whites had some kind of need to glorify blacks.  I encountered more than one who made annual trips to Atlanta to do homage to MLK.  In addition, I met several Vermont whites who glorified the new South Africa and made regular visits down there, to wash away their sins I guess. </p>
<p>This is anecdotal of course, but I have never run across the same need among southern whites to glorify MLK and go down to SA. If Vermont had a thirty percent black population, I suspect that its race-mixing would be worse than the south.  </p>
<p>Southern white racial identity is remarkably strong give the assault on it for more than forty years.  </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t discount the impact of the military on the south since many large installations are located there.  Among military personnel you will always see huge numbers of white girls married to or shacking with blacks of the most ugly sort. This is a military recruiting tool to get more black enlistment.  &#8220;Join the army and you&rsquo;ll get lots of benefits, wink, wink&#8221;. <br/>

Women seek out men with status.  Put yourself into the shoes of a young naive White girl growing up in America looking for a good mate to give her children.  Everything that she sees advertises the Black man as high status.  <br/>
<p><br/>
TV commercials and TV personalities, movies, newspapers, magazines, the President of the USA, and White young men&rsquo;s adulation of Black jocks all tell the innocent White woman that Black men are not only just as good as White men but better.<br/>
<p><br/>
To be honest it is a conspiracy.<br/>
<p><br/>
This is the frightening truth; think about it.  In America nothing negative is ever seen or heard about Black males.  Nothing positive is ever seen or heard about White men.<br/>
<p><br/>
The only good White man is a White man that refuses to be racist which means he acknowledges the superiority of the Black man. The only negative feature ever so lightly touched upon about the Black man is his criminal activities and that is covered up or brushed off.<br/>
<p><br/>
Women are biologically programmed to select for status.  Until White men start disparaging Blacks, White women will select Black men.  <br/>
<p><br/>
To counter the all pervasive pro-Black propaganda we have to point out to our young men and women whenever possible that the TV commercial is selling good Black guy / bad dumb White guy, and not selling fast foods, cars, insurance, beer, or whatever. <br/>

		<p>Miscegenation is genocide for Whites.  Those who practice it should be shunned.</p>
<p>Whites need to understand that the old ways we had  &mdash;  two child families, etc.  &mdash;  will now kill us off. We need to breed as we once did.  No birth control for Whites. No abortions for Whites. No family planning for Whites.  No waiting to have children for Whites.  It is in our nature as White people to invent and explore when our numbers teem.  </p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip; Sorry, don&rsquo;t agree. My personal assessment of &ldquo;yellow-hauling&rdquo; white men is that they&rsquo;re mostly incapable of having a real relationship with a real woman, a white woman, because they don&rsquo;t want to have a real give-and-take relationship, they want to have their way all the time. They gravitate toward Asian women because they know Asian women won&rsquo;t say no or disagree with any vigor. &hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh really? And what&rsquo;s the definition of a &#8216;real woman&rsquo; then, one who constantly &#8216;tests&rsquo; a man with pointless bickering, complaining, demands for &#8216;equality&rsquo; (when it suits them of course; women will gladly accept inequality when it&rsquo;s in their favor). </p>
<p>You can try to put whatever spin on it you want, men prefer FEMININE women (just like women prefer masculine men, in reality), and the fact is that today&rsquo;s white women simply have lost the ability to cultivate their femininity to a very, very large extent. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, just LOOK at them: sweat pants, baggy shorts, tattoos, poor manners, etc. And you&rsquo;re telling me that it&rsquo;s because White men can&rsquo;t &#8216;handle&rsquo; them? I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that the WM who marry Asian women are more educated than average; what does this tell us? That they can&rsquo;t handle WW disagreeing with them, or that when given leverage they choose women who are less conflict-prone and neurotic?</p>
<p>Again, this isn&rsquo;t intrinsic. White culture used to encourage WW to develop their femininity in all sorts of ways. If you go to Europe you can still see this in certain places; the women still dress classy and behave properly. It isn&rsquo;t seen as &#8216;degrading&rsquo; or humiliating for a woman to act womanly. In the US, with its more powerful feminist nonsense, the women have been trained to think that &#8216;femininity&rsquo; is something negative, and so they are constantly trying to &#8216;one up&rsquo; the men around them. It isn&rsquo;t attractive. It&rsquo;s extremely unattractive, and if men choose to distance themselves from it, it has nothing to do with their manhood&hellip;</p>

&#8220;A 247% increase in a decade seems to be more indicative of a change in how people are reporting their ancestry, rather than a substantial demographic shift. The same goes for the supposed doubling of mulattos.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree.  Isn&rsquo;t the mixed race classification something new on the census?  Until recently even the lightest blacks had to check black.  Now they can checked mix which they are.  There many asian White and hispanic White marriages.  They add to the numbers of mixed race persons.</p>
<p>Most of the mixed race people in my state are asian White.</p>

		<p>For those white men who have an Asian fetish, I have this to say: reality is not a fantasy. I&rsquo;ve lived in California for years and have been immersed in Asian culture. Most Asian women are not submissive kittens. It really depends from country to country, but Asian women are typically dominant and controlling. They run the household and they wear the pants. Also, when you marry an Asian women, you marry her family. That means that you must follow their very strict, complicated cultural protocol.  For educated, upscale families, they will be very generous, and hospitable&hellip;however they bring up your children, and generally control your life. For those of you who marry bar girls in Thailand, you are expected to financially support their family. You are the sole benefactor. Get ready to start wiring your savings to rural Thailland or similar. I recently saw something at LAX. it was a white man, about 65 years old. He looked ex-military. He was with his wife&hellip;a Thai woman of about 40. She looked like an aging  bar girl. They were toting her elderly parents along and he was paying for everything. He looked miserable and kept. </p>
<p>I generally have respect for Asian cultures, but marrying one is too complicated. An older black woman once told me, &#8220;&#8216;Be friends with whomever, but MARRY YOUR OWN KIND. Marry the culture you are accustomed to. After the novelty wears off, all you have is problems.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Kelly in SC, you are quite right about South Carolina being a place where Females marry-down in droves.  Several of our relatives have multimillion-Dollar beach houses there.  We have invitations to all of them.  We go to NONE of them.  Our kids view the milieu as unwholesome and dangerous, and we agree.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hedonistic&rsquo; is the closest adjective I can come up with, right now, to describe the culture.  But there is more to it than that.  However you&rsquo;d describe the prevailing mentality there, we don&rsquo;t want it rubbing off on us.  Blonds are generally smarter than am I.  But the ones in South Carolina, of the class who are marrying Blacks, and alternately, snaring &#8216;Raven-haired Aristocrats&rsquo;, are decidedly dumb. Avoiding having our kids lured into disadvantageous (and genetically disastrous) unions with these people is one reason we have stayed away.  I would add that drug use is far more accepted there, among the affluent, than it is here in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Now, may I address the &#8216;Sub-thread&rsquo; which has emerged here, regarding White men and Asian women?  Too many White American women treat men like bad Dogs.  They seem to see men as creatures who deserve to be controlled, belittled, and manipulated.  Consequently, too many men live in fear of saying or doing something which might trigger disdainful/censorious/critical/punitive/rejecting reactions from females.  And men do not enjoy being treated as stupid, by people (5 IQ points, on average) less intelligent than themselves.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m extremely fit, I&rsquo;ve never been &#8216;pretty&rsquo;.  But I dated a series of spectacular men, before marrying the smartest and sweetest of the bunch (he, also possessing a physical advantage or two not proper to describe in this venue).  They dated me, rather than far prettier girls, because I made them feel good about themselves, did not behave like a Landmine waiting to be stepped-on, and always pulled my own weight.</p>
<p>Instead of being the needy/sultry &#8216;temptress&rsquo;, I was the one who would be right there, helping some Muscle Monster wash the mud off his truck.  Too, between sets of Calf-raises, I could massage his giant Calves. On Neck Machine day, my hands were magic on a big bull-neck.  And while he was getting the boat ready for a day on the lake, I&rsquo;d see nothing wrong with jumping on the tractor, and mowing his Mom&rsquo;s acreage (His Mom: &#8220;Marry HER!  Marry THAT girl!&#8221;).  I didn&rsquo;t pander, but neither did I pout, when things didn&rsquo;t go my way.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen, that&rsquo;s the competitive edge Asian women have over far too many American White women.  They&rsquo;re &#8216;teammates&rsquo; rather than pretty, posturing &#8216;prizes&rsquo;, with &#8220;look but don&rsquo;t touch&#8221; attitudes.  White guys aren&rsquo;t dumb.  Only the truly sick among them want some toxic, untrustworthy, high-maintenance Diva, whose makeup is going to smear all over the place.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think the majority of White American women are as bad as what I&rsquo;ve described.  But it only takes contact with a couple of the bad ones, to forever sour a guy&rsquo;s perceptions, and MAKE HIM AFRAID OF HIS OWN KIND.  So there he goes&hellip; off to another race&hellip; a marriage where the plumbing surely doesn&rsquo;t fit quite right&hellip; a union whose hybrid offspring will be little, dark, and less-than-gorgeous (and prime candidates for Orthodontia).  All because White women have been socially conditioned to be &#8216;difficult&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ve got to add:  White American women have been taught to live in little dream worlds.  Far too many are incapable of distinguishing between &#8216;how things are&rsquo; and &#8216;how things ought to be&rsquo; (Voting for Obama is symptomatic of this, I think).  This drives men absolutely NUTS.  Asian women tend to be as pragmatic as are guys.  What guy in his right mind wouldn&rsquo;t prefer a physically nondescript gal who lives in the Real World, to some beautiful &#8216;Princess&rsquo;, living in &#8216;Prettye Poni Malibu Barbi&rsquo;s Dream Palace Money-is-no-object Fairytale Land&rsquo;?</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stop, apparently, so one more:  Asian women tend to get degrees that lead to jobs.  White American women too often go for degrees which are worthless. Thus: Asian Wife = Second Income. White Wife(too often)= Whiny\helpless\bitter\depressed Drain on Resources.  Another competitive edge for Asian women.  </p>

 I hear you. But what you fail to mention is that many if not most of the white men with asian wives/girlfriends really have no choice. It is the white female that has abandoned the white male (at least the good ones; decent, law abiding financially successful white males who do not have tattoos and go to bars and get into fights). And yes, I have an asian girlfriend…</p>
<p><br/>
double standerd much? it take both a white guy and white girl to make a white child. you are no better than the white girls with the black guys. as a white dude I think you&rsquo;ve given up on ww. I for one will stick to the white girls. </p>

		<p>I live near Tallahassee.  I don&rsquo;t see too many white girls with black boys. On the infrequent occasion when I do see a mixed couple, I can&rsquo;t tell if the girl is Southern or not.  I suspect she is not.  Also, the couples are ALWAYS lower class.  Even liberal Southerners will not involve themselves in behavior like this.  I know of one upper class couple who adopted a mixed race kid.  I don&rsquo;t know how that&rsquo;s working out.  I have heard rumors that they are having problems with the child.</p>

<p>Wow!  Another truly  superlative analysis from Lauren!   Well worth reading and heeding.  Wise women will do so. The rest will not and will become angry old maids.  They were waiting for their prince in shining armor to come along and swoop them up.  Too late, they will realize there was no such prince.  He was only a fantasy.  In real life, we have to take what we can get. </p>
<p>Yes, absolutely true.   All of it.  But what else could be expected from a generation that has been conditioned by TV sitcoms and advertisements over the course of a lifetime?</p>

It&rsquo;s still the lower class that propagates this birthrate. No matter what propaganda the media tries to push, a white woman with black kids is seen as low class. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve been in a store and heard what I thought was a loud black woman only to see a white woman with black children in tow. You never see upper middle class white girls with black children. </p>

<p>  It&rsquo;s good to see that some traditional clever Southern girls are still alive and kicking in the Deep South. Before the Civil Rights disaster of the last century, our women were truly magnificent. The entire rebellion would have collapsed overnight if not for the steadfast and critical support of Southern women. If too many contemporary brainwashed Southern gals seem to be going over to the dark side, we have only ourselves to blame for it.</p>
