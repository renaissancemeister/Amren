			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Huey Freeman, Herald-Review (Decatur), September 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three suspects who were arrested last week in connection with the shooting death of 24-year-old Billy J. Rutherford were each charged Thursday with three counts of first-degree murder.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shitavious J. Cook, 15, was arraigned Thursday morning on his charges, punishable by up to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>He also was charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a firearm for a shotgun attack on a motorcyclist who Cook mistakenly believed to be Rutherford.</p>
<p>Felton T. Estes, 28, and Demeco D. Hill, 35, are each facing 20 to 60 years in prison, with a 15-year enhancement for carrying a firearm during the crime. {snip}</p>
<p>On his first-degree murder charges, Cook is facing 20 to 60 years plus 25 years to life for shooting a firearm that was the proximate cause of death. {snip}</p>
<p>Cook allegedly admitted to police that he shot Rutherford with a shotgun.</p>
<p>According to Illinois law, defendants who are 15 and older are automatically tried as adults when charged with first-degree murder or any charges arising out of the same incident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to statements made to the police, Rutherford was shot because he &#8220;had been stealing drug-related money from Estes, and Rutherford had made threats against Cook&rsquo;s life,&#8221; according to a complaint for an arrest warrant. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During an interview with police, Cook said he went to the alley after hearing the gunshots. He saw Rutherford lying on the ground, with Estes near his body. Hill was not in sight.</p>
<p>Cook told police that Estes then gave him a shotgun and told him to shoot Rutherford. Cook then fired one round at Rutherford.</p>
<p>Police were told Hill fired the initial gunshots in the alley.</p>
<p>Cook told police during his interview that they could find spent 9 mm casings at the scene. The police had already located three 9 mm casings, a detail they had not released.</p>
<p>During his arraignment, Cook, a 5-foot-6-inch, 140-pound teen, sat in the jury box in the custody of juvenile probation officers. {snip}</p>
<p>Cook, who was arrested 23Â½ hours after the shooting, admitted to police that he shot Rutherford with a shotgun but said he did so after Rutherford was dead, according to a sworn statement by a police officer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cook&rsquo;s charges of attempted murder and aggravated battery stem from an incident that occurred five days before the homicide.</p>
<p>At 11:54 p.m. Aug. 24, a 31-year-old man was shot while riding his motorcycle east on Grand Avenue, at Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. The victim told police he heard that a 15-year-old male, nicknamed &#8220;Tay,&#8221; was the shooter.</p>
<p>Cook, whose nickname is &#8220;Tay,&#8221; admitted he shot a shotgun at a man who was riding a black-and-yellow motorcycle at Grand Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. {snip}</p>
<p>Cook said the intended target of that shooting was Rutherford, who he said had made threats against his life.</p>

<p>I should hope so, with a real first name like Fecestavious.</p>
<p>Seems to me whoever gave him his first name at birth really didn&rsquo;t imagine him amounting to much in life.  Would you hire a lawyer or see a doctor with his first name?</p>

		<p>Avious Cook.  Some one once told me that black Philly women sometimes named their babies feemalee for girls and malee for boys.  They thought the ID braclets female surname and male surname meant that the Drs or nurses had aleady named the babies.</p>
<p>Of course Latrina is a classic black name. What would the male form be?  I can see boy girl twins latrina and la****e.</p>
<p>I think I had better not translate into English the Japanese word for child of a black American soldier and a Japanese woman.</p>

		<p> I needed a good laugh. Excrementavious there sounds like a real winner; particularly as his name has been composed of words meaning &#8216;flying feces&rsquo; or perhaps &#8216;feces of or from a bird&rsquo; (verb conjugation in Latin-ebonics is really hard to understand.)<br>
 The other two may as well have been called Felon and Democrat from birth. What gets me though, is that the people who picked these names for their children are considered to be as competent as you or I. No wonder the country is being flushed down the latrina.</p>

		<p>Anonymous # 5. If the moderator censored my comment made several hours ago which I think they did, you would have read that I actually met a black female about 28 years ago in central Fla with the first two names of &#8220;Latasha Latrine&#8221; so help me God. This can&rsquo;t be made up.</p>

Do black parents think about the fact that their children will have to interview for a job one day?</p>
<p><br>
Of course not, dear. The fact of the matter is people like this boy and his parents think of welfare, gang bangin&rsquo; and drug dealin&rsquo; as a way of life. Considering this kind of lifestyle, chances are they will die very young, most likely shot by another gang member. So no, I don&rsquo;t think his parents expected much from him at all.</p>

<p>Poo-tavious probably needs tons of &#8220;street cred&#8221; just to walk to the corner store without being mocked.  This is one black criminal I can&rsquo;t entirely blame for living the thug life.  <br>

<p>&#8220;Cook [&hellip;] admitted to police that he shot Rutherford with a shotgun but said he did so <i>after Rutherford was dead</i>&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
America as a nation really MUST confront this epidemic of black-on-corpse violence! </p>
<p>Also, what kind of an Office of Births Registration (or whatever they&rsquo;re called) allows a mother to officially register a newborn with a name like that? These registrars are supposed to have standards, and a (ahem) &#8220;blacklist&#8221; of words you CAN&rsquo;T name your child. If you can&rsquo;t legally register your kid as, say, &#8220;Stupid Idiot Smith&#8221; or &#8220;Worthless Bonehead Jones&#8221;, why would you be allowed a name containing an obscenity? If the DMV wouldn&rsquo;t allow that word on a vanity license plate, why would it be allowed on a Birth Certificate? What kind of civil servant said &#8220;Yes&#8221; to this babymama&rsquo;s request for such a ridiculous name? </p>
<p>Oh wait, I think I know the answer   &mdash;   it was a civil servant <i>of the same race as the babymama.</i> </p>

		<p>In the heady days of the early 20th Century, clerics, Bishops, scientists, and demographers were all extolling the humane methods of Eugenics- apart from abortion. That only came with Margaret Sanger, of a later generation, coupled with Marxist philosophy,</p>
<p>Clearly, birth control does not work, when the Government encourages &#8216;Massa-sim&rsquo; by welfare, EBT, etc.</p>
<p>Abortion is wrong, in that the innocent suffers along with the sin of the parents.</p>
<p>But to stop defectives from breeding by sterilization, (even by forced means) yet allowing them the sexual act, can only be considered moral and humane, when looking at the effects of low IQ mating here represented.</p>

		<p>In Germany there is actually a list of approved names and if the name is not on it you cannot be issued a birth certificate. I have heard other that other European countries have the same thing. Barring any free speech issues I think that a rule banning names that spell out foul words or that have bad connotations could be disallowed on birth certificates. This would make the afore mentioned &#8216;tavious, vomit or shaunasty non-options.</p>

		<p>Blacks are by far the worst when it comes to making fun of oddball names. There was a black jr high kid who had the unfortunate name of Casper, and all the blacks would constantly call him Casper the friendly(big) head.Huey Newton, (remember him?) shot and killed a 17 year old black prostitute in Oakland because she called him Baby(Baby Huey) inadvertinetly.A black new mother wanted to name her newborn Lovely Precious. Worse than a Boy named Sue.</p>

		<p>AmRen (I <i>think</i> it was AmRen - either online or the hard copy I get) once ran an article about all the insane names that black people name their kids. I&rsquo;d repeat them here, but this post would be way to long to publish. If I find the link later, I&rsquo;ll send it in for posting.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is &#8216;Anfernee&rsquo; (he used to be in the NBA and his momma couldn&rsquo;t pronounce &#8216;Anthony&rsquo; correctly.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think this kid could&rsquo;ve legally changed his name (or maybe you have to be 18 to do that - I&rsquo;m not sure). Look at all the black guys that have changed their names. A few or the more &#8216;(in)famous&rsquo; ones were:</p>
<p>Lloyd Bernard Free -&gt; World B. Free (NBA)<br>
Chad Javon Johnson -&gt; Ochocinco (NFL)<br>
Ronald William Artest, Jr. -&gt; Metta World Peace (NBA)</p>
<p>Then of course, there are all the rappers who went the other way:<br>
