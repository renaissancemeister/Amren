<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As more parents forgo measles vaccinations for their children, the number of Californians contracting the highly contagious disease has reached a 10-year high, outpacing every other state in the nation.</p>
<p>As of Monday, there were 28 reported cases of measles so far in 2011  &mdash;  the largest statewide figure reported, according to state and federal health officials. That is the highest incidence since 2001, when 40 people in California reported having measles. There were nine cases in all of 2009 and 27 cases in 2010.</p>
<p>Of the cases reported this year, 22 of the 28 either were unvaccinated or very likely to lack the vaccine, according to the California Department of Public Health. More than half had recently traveled internationally, including to Asia and Europe, which have seen a drop in immunizations and widespread outbreaks.</p>
<p>Measles, transmitted through coughing and sneezing, can cause ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, brain injuries and death. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cases are also on the rise around the nation. In 2011, 211 people were diagnosed with measles  &mdash;  the highest number in 15 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many contracted it abroad, and about 85% were unvaccinated or had undocumented vaccination status.</p>
<p>The disease was eliminated in the United States in 2000. But those traveling outside the country often don&rsquo;t realize the danger of exposure, said Preeta Kutty, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC.</p>

		<p>Sure&hellip;&hellip;.it&rsquo;s entirely due to Americans taking vacations abroad.  We had it eradicated in  2000.  I guess nobody at all had traveled abroad from 1990 to 2000.  Right?</p>
<p>No, the lying media once again tries to cover up the causes.  It&rsquo;s IMPORTED by the third worlders we seem to not be able to bring into this country in enough numbers, without health checks (as used to be done) and without criminal background checks (as used to be done).  Our treasonous elite doesn&rsquo;t care if diseases are imported, if crime is imported, as long as the immigrants are of the proper color, and are likely to vote for more Democratic socialism.  Before 1965 we demanded that immigrants could show they had money or resources enough to not go on the dole, that they passed health checks and did not bring in contagious diseases, and that they passed criminal background checks so we weren&rsquo;t importing hardened criminals AND they had to possess a skill or trade that was needed.  But, you see, people who EARN their way in this country take a dim view of having their labor taken from them and given to those who won&rsquo;t work.  So they vote against socialist schemes.  They came as much for the freedom as for the opportunity.  And they jealously guarded both their freedom and their paychecks.  There was no such thing as &#8220;birthing tourism&#8221; nor the expectation that if they came here illegally, they could demand social services at tax payer expense.  They did not come to establish an enclave of Germans, Irish, Norwegians, Italians whatever in order to get enough numbers to colonize and break away a piece of America to become part of the country they left.<br/>
It was a different country, and a better country.</p>

		<p>California would only be &#8220;outpacing&#8221; the other states if the 28 cases represent a higher per capita figure. </p>

		<p>My daughter is allergic to the composite in which the measles vaccine is cultured (the MMR vaccine itself is another issue that I&rsquo;ll skip   &mdash;   for now).</p>
<p>I was sent to a allergy specialist who told me (behind closed door in his private office) that the MMR vaccine is imperative in S. California because of new, more powerful and sometimes deadly strains of measles that were coming in from SE Asia!! (otherwise, he told me, he wouldn&rsquo;t bother with the vaccine).</p>

		<p>Measles and other childhood illnesses decreased not because of vaccinations, but due to better hygiene and sanitation.</p>
<p>I wonder how things are in Mexico as far as hygiene and sanitation go?  </p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve never been very good, which is just one reason why you should never eat at a Mexican restaurant or one staffed by Hispanics.  Since mass agriculture has been using ever rotating Mexican labor both in the field and at for example, food processing plants, more salmonella and water contamination has occurred throughout the U.S.  The simple equation is that the more we allow third world cultures into the U.S. the more the U.S. will become like a third world country.  But you know this, I am sure.</p>

<p>Illegal Mexicans (and legals for that matter) have always been going back and forth across the border.  How those with an ocean are doing it has to have something to do with either drug money or subsidizing by one or another Somali Islamic group.  All those millions gained from piracy must be getting spent somewhere.  Remember also that Somalis love Khat, that drug they chew and get all crazy on.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if we soon hear about Somalis being arrested while high on Khat.  In fact, I bet it is already happening, but no one will run the embarrassing story about how we imported another drug/crime problem into the U.S.</p>
<p>But whatever the reason is, it&rsquo;s not likely to be very nice.  I can&rsquo;t really imagine the Lutheran Conference actually giving Somalis free tickets to go back and forth at will.</p>

		<p>#7:  I was pointing out that the article tries to make it a vaccination issue, when the issue is Mexicans bringing their lifestyle with them.</p>
<p>Of course, acknowledging how Mexicans normally live would be racist, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I wonder, out of all the measles cases, what percentage is Hispanic?</p>
