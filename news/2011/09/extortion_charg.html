<h1>Extortion Charges Hit Labor Coalition</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tamer El-Ghobashy, Wall Street Journal, September 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The price of &#8220;security&#8221; at some construction sites was $1,000 a month. &#8220;Labor peace&#8221; was more expensive: $400 a week. Even &#8220;good will&#8221; was for sale, going for $100 a week.</p>
<p>To contractors who refused to pay, the United Hispanic Construction Workers delivered a stark message, sending van-loads of its members wielding baseball bats and pickaxes to New York City construction sites, authorities said.</p>
<p>Manhattan prosecutors made the allegations Monday in an indictment charging the UHCW and its two top officials with using violence and the threat of violence to extort contractors.</p>
<p>Charges against the nonprofit came after a lengthy investigation built around wiretapped phone calls between contractors and the UHCW&rsquo;s leaders, prosecutors said. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Their defense attorney, Murray Richman, said he believed authorities were unfairly targeting the group, which he said has secured more than 10,000 jobs for members in 25 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;If white guys do it, they call it a union,&#8221; Mr. Richman said. &#8220;If people of color do it, they call it a crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to its website, the coalition was established in 1982 to help black and Latino construction workers secure jobs that were historically dominated by white laborers and their unions. Violent clashes between UHCW members and contractors have occurred over the years, police said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the coalition forced companies that wouldn&rsquo;t hire its workers to make payments to avoid trouble. When contractors refused, coalition members would show up in force at their sites. Over the past five years, the group targeted 15 job sites, which prosecutors would not name.</p>
<p>In several cases, Mr. Vance said, &#8220;as many as 30 members stormed a job site in an attempt to intimidate the builder and force him or her into paying for bogus security costs, labor peace, or protection from other labor coalitions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lots of normal folks carry baseball bats and pickaxes around with them all the time.</p>
<p>Having such an item on your person during a confrontation suggests that the use of force is imminent and premeditated. And lethal force at that too. One blow from a bat or pickaxe can kill or cripple for life.</p>

		<p>thugs are thugs.  Coming on the construction site armed and threatening should be enough for a self defense plea.  But being New York only the thugs have guns, I forgot that.</p>

<p>And if white guys call themselves the United White Construction Workers, they call it racism.</p>

		<p>When the Irish first landed in drovers more than a century and a half ago in New York crime rose more than a hundred percent. In 2011 America takes in more immigrants than ever, even more non-assimilable than the first wave that landed the country&rsquo;s shores. The country never learns.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not just the hispanics that are engaging in violence on NYC constructions sites. The Russians and Eastern Europeans are doing it also. I had a conservation with a some White and Black American unionized construction workers who were protesting the use of foreign scab labor. They told me that the Russian immigrant construction gangs threatened them with extreme violence..to point of hunting them down and murdering them. I am not making this up.</p>
<p>Larger point:since from 1930-1973 America was largely labor self-sufficient. Anyone who claims that American can&rsquo;t be labor self-sufficient is a bold face liar and is a mortal enemy of Native Born White American Labor. The are only two reasons for opposing a labor self-sufficient America:1)to the steal wages of millions of Native Born White Americans and hand it over to the White Liberal Greedy Cheating Class and 2)to race-replace the Native Born White American Majority with  hostile and high fetility post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>I am opposed to an immigration moratorium:all nonwhite immigration should be shut down to 0 permanently. The moratorium is meant to appease the treaonous Republican Party. The immigration moratorium is very much compatible with race-replacement.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t feel a bit sorry for the cannibal capitalist contractors.</p>
<p>It started 170 years ago with cheap Irish labor.  The Irish formed labor unions for living wages. So the cannibal capitalists imported Italian and E. European cheap labor who soon joined the unions for living wages.</p>
<p>By 1925 the unions joined the nativists to force the congress to restrict immigration.</p>
<p>The cannibal capitalists spent the next 40 years plotting to return to the glory days of an endless supply of cheap immigrant labor.</p>
<p>Now they have it, an endless stream pouring in from Mexico and the most dysfunctional, corrupt and criminal White nation in the world, Russia.</p>

		<p>Another American hit by an illegal alien with no driver&rsquo;s license and under a deportation order.  Wonder how he pays for his new truck and single family home?  Who employs him?</p>
<p>Note that he dragged her instead of stopping.</p>
<p>An 11-year-old Ipswich girl was hit and dragged by a truck while riding her bike to school Wednesday. Now, residents say the details surrounding the horrible incident are becoming all too common in the Bay State.</p>
<p>Police say the suspect who hit the sixth grader as he pulled out of the driveway of his home is an illegal immigrant who doesn&rsquo;t even have a license.</p>
<p>It turns out 35-year-old Wanderson DaSilva-Neto has an outstanding warrant for his deportation back to Brazil.</p>

<p>Corruption, Racial Discrimination as Construction Gangs Steal Millions in Texas</p>
<p>By Greg Groogan </p>
<p>Published September 21, 2011</p>
<p>File Photo: Construction worker in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>These days, it&rsquo;s something you rarely, if ever, see: African-Americans laboring within the largely Hispanic construction crews working the Gulf Coast&rsquo;s heavy industrial projects. T</p>
<p>Ricardo Charles says he knows exactly why and after 33 years in the building trade, he&rsquo;s blowing the whistle. </p>
<p>Black and White</p>
<p>Charles says those who run organized, largely Hispanic crews almost never hire willing African-American laborers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, blacks they are out of the question. Blacks are out of the question. Nobody wants a black person in there,&#8221; Charles insisted, a Mexican-American man.</p>
<p>The practice of rejecting black labor is deeply entrenched discrimination which extends to white workers as well, Charles says.</p>
<p>These men and women are effectively cut off from decent-paying construction jobs by secretive Mexican labor gangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are afraid that white people are not going to put up with their unethical acts,&#8221; Charles explained. &#8220;</p>
<p>The Mordida</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking about bribes.  They call it &#8220;Mordida&#8221; in Mexico, the bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is actually just like in Mexico. It&rsquo;s not how much you know, it&rsquo;s who you know,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>For years, on nearly every major industrial construction site in Texas, workers have been quietly forced to pay the leaders of Mexican labor gangs hundreds of dollars up front just to obtain a job. </p>
<p>With each weekly pay-check, the kick backs from workers to gang leaders continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not only how much you pay to go in. You pay anything from $50 to $70 a week while you are in the project,&#8221; Charles insisted.</p>
<p>Anyone who objects to paying the price is quickly isolated and almost as rapidly cut loose from the job without cause. </p>
<p>&#8220;They have these groups that are going to harass you, they want to insult you, degrade you. They want to make it very, very hard on you. They want to make false accusations about you: that you don&rsquo;t know how to do the job, you don&rsquo;t know how to talk to them, but they are all in the same conspiracy. It is a gang, like organized crime,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>Bed of Rotten Money</p>
<p>Over dozens of years and hundreds of sites across Texas, including the giant petrochemical complex in Port Arthur, he says Mexican construction cliques have muscled honest workers out of millions of dollars. </p>
<p>Money that&rsquo;s made gang bosses rich.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody knows. Yes, many people know that you have to belong to a clique in order to work. Mexicans exploiting Mexican and contractors looking the other way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing casual about his allegations. Everything he&rsquo;s witnessed:</p>
<p>  &mdash;   The &#8220;pay for play&#8221;<br/>
  &mdash;   The graft<br/>
  &mdash;   The enforced silence<br/>
  &mdash;   And the corrupt complicity of contractors</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all recorded in &#8220;Mexican Cliques in Construction&#8221;, the book he paid thousands of his own hard-earned dollars to publish. </p>
<p>He has also brought his allegations and evidence to the FBI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people are victims. Many of my friends who are honest are victims,&#8221; he insisted. &#8220;We are applying a system that didn&rsquo;t work in Mexico for hundreds years and actually it&rsquo;s working here in Houston, Texas.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been told by contractors and the few American construction workers left that the illegals will steal every tool and building material they can get their hands on.  </p>
<p>Sometimes site is looted of material over the weekend. The contractors are getting exactly what they deserved.</p>
<p>In 1970 they had honest well trained and skilled construction workers.  They wanted cheap labor.  They got the dregs of the world extorting money and stealing tools and materials.</p>

In Mexico the gangsters are extorting money from school teachers as well.</p>
<p>Five severed HEADS found in sack outside Mexican primary school in latest sickening threat from drugs cartelsBy Laurie Whitwell Mexican police have found five severed heads stuffed in a sack outside a primary school in the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. The gruesome discovery comes after drugs gangs threatened to attack elementary school teachers if they did not pay half their wages to the drugs cartels. The extortion demands forced around 130 schools in the city to close earlier this month, after administrators and parents decided it was not safe enough&hellip; <br/>

		<p>&ldquo;If white guys do it, they call it a union,&rdquo; Mr. Richman said. &ldquo;If people of color do it, they call it a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, this is a lie on its face.  The anti-racketeering laws were passed in the 1950s and were aimed at unions which by then were controlled by organized crime.  (The author of those bills was of course, JFK who was a Senator at the time).  When these types make this sort of superficial argument, they typically are relying on the listener or reader being as ignorant of American labor history as they are, and I always find this mechanism behind Hispanic argumentation, for all relevant subjects.  Not only that, but he is saying that because (he alleges) whites have always done it, it&rsquo;s okay if they do.  This doesn&rsquo;t even make sense as a rationalized argument.</p>
<p>Just wait, if Obama gets the infrastructure part of the economic stimulus passed, it will be mostly an event for more illegal immigration, because whites contractors will be ignored or pressured to hire Hispanics (and blacks).  This could set off riots nationwide, wherever the projects are located.  That this organization for promoting Latino and blacks in labor over whites was allowed to organize in 1982 shows the lack of scrutiny by the REAGAN administration.  It formed during his watch (or should I say, nap), and could have been predicted to produce violence eventually because it has to promote inequality and sets of a confrontation by its very existence.</p>
