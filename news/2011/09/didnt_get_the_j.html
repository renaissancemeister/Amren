<p>Some might consider it an ugly truth that attractive people are often more successful than those less blessed with looks.</p>
<p>But now our appearance is emerging in legal disputes as a new kind of discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lookism&rsquo;, it is claimed, is the new racism, and should be banished from civilised societies.</p>
<p>It is currently the subject of several court actions in America, and some experts say similar cases should be considered here too.</p>
<p>Economist Daniel Hamermesh argues that ugliness is no different from race or a disability, and suggests unattractive people deserve legal protection.</p>
<p>&#8216;My research shows being good-looking helps you earn more money, find a higher-earning spouse and even get better deals on mortgages,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Some people are born ugly and there&rsquo;s not much they can do about it. You&rsquo;re pretty much stuck with your looks.</p>
<p>&#8216;Logically there&rsquo;s no less reason to protect the ugly than the disabled, African Americans, other racial minorities or religious minorities, as we do. We could even have affirmative action for the ugly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Lawrence Davies, of the Equal Justice law firm, believes we should be wary of amending current equality laws.</p>
<p>&#8216;People who appear to be conventionally beautiful have fewer barriers to workplace success,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;However, protecting conventionally ugly people or offensively linking that condition to a disability would take society in the wrong direction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The issue has been highlighted by the case of Shirley Ivey, 61, who is suing her former employer in Washington for &#8216;lookism&rsquo;. She left her job at the Department of Consumer and Regulatory affairs suffering from stress after allegedly being told by a supervisor that he would like her more if she was prettier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Germans think the average European looks just like them, while the Portuguese believe a Mediterranean appearance is more representative.</p>
<p>A study published in the journal Psychological Science found that when we are asked to describe a group we belong to, we tend to attribute our own features to that description.</p>
<p>Roland Imhoff, of the University of Bonn, recruited two sets of participants, in Germany and Portugal, and asked each person to study 770 pairs of pictures on a computer. The pictures were based on the same composite photo but had been subtly altered.</p>
<p>The subjects were asked which photo they felt looked most European.</p>
<p>Mr Average for the Portuguese group was a darker man with wider-set eyes.</p>
<p>But the person considered to be the average European by the Germans had lighter hair and Germanic features.</p>
<p>Dr Imhoff said: &#8216;It may be that this is just a sort of mental shortcut people use to think of an abstract concept, like &#8220;European&#8221; or &#8220;American&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;It may also be that people are expressing a kind of subtle belief that they think their group is better than others.&rsquo;</p>
