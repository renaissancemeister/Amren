<h1>Video Shows Teens Mob Clerk, Rob Convenience Store in Red Bird Area of Dallas</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Peterson, Dallas News, September 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Dallas police are investigating a convenience store robbery in which a group of teens attacked a clerk.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A large crowd of young people entered the store about 10:15 p.m. and began throwing bottles at one another.</p>
<p>When the clerk confronted them and tried to close the door, someone in the crowd punches him, knocking him to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once they got me on the ground, I thought they were going to kill me,&#8221; C.J. Thomas told Channel 8&rsquo;s Monika Diaz.</p>

		<p>I know this 18 year old Indian kid who shot black thugs trying to rob his parent&rsquo;s convenience store (He worked there overnight) The cops didn&rsquo;t charge him because he was shooting in self defense. I always wonder if he had been a white 18 year old, he would have been charged with a &#8216;hate crime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maybe, there is an advantage to being a model minority with brown skin. We can defend ourselves from thugs without being charged with a hate crime.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to all the white victims of Black violence and I do apologize for having the same skin color as those thugs. </p>

		<p>This type of behavior is very similar to what we see in Africa, in Haiti, in New Orleans, in London, in Paris, in . . well, basically anywhere in the world where Africans congregate.  The problem is inherent in Africans.  It is their nature.  Judge them not because of the color of their skin, but because of their character.</p>

		<p>The clerk is lucky that those two girls had enough humanity to save him. In most incidents the black girls join in with the stomping. The clerk had guts though, but it would have been better had he been armed! Trying to stop a mob of shop lifters by yourself is asking to be stabbed or shot. I&rsquo;m glad he escaped with minor injuries.</p>
<p>It seems every two or three days there is some kind of black mob attack somewhere in the USA. </p>

		<p>The mob lootings continue, and the MSM continues for the most part to pretend not to notice. What a great role model Obama is!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some will focus on the two good samaritans who pulled the clerk back inside, but two good samaritans out of a mob that size does not speak well of the black &#8220;community.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The ridiculous Diaz calls the culprits &#8220;customers&#8221; and &#8220;students&#8221; and calls the hate-crime-beating a &#8220;fight&#8221;. </p>
<p>George Orwell wrote in &#8220;Politics and the English Language&#8221; at the end of WW II that responsible citizens should break any of the rules of grammar rather than say anything &#8220;outright barbarous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calling these animals &#8220;customers&#8221; and &#8220;students&#8221; and calling the latest black-mob beating of a White a &#8220;fight&#8221; is barbarous. And we all know it started after Obama began belittling the &#8220;typical White&#8221; and after he and his gangsta AG Eric Holder began turning a blind eye to the black &#8220;payback&#8221; that is now ubiquitous in our crumbling nation. </p>
<p>I am tired of reading on the internet of Whites/Tea Partyers/Boy Scouts/Returning Veterans/Displayers of the American Flag who are afraid that one day they will be locked up in government camps as threats to our nation&rsquo;s security. They/We have done no wrong. </p>
<p>It is these people who must be locked up. I am beginning to foresee a big old-fashioned cowboy roundup. Lock &#8216;em up. Punish them severely!</p>
<p>Lastly, that young man has got a backbone of steel. He&rsquo;s a true American.</p>

		<p>Most outlets on the alternative right, like Amren and Takimag, have been addressing the flashmobs now for some time. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; left to tackle the subject, and now Tim Wise finally has.</p>
<p>He claims that white racists are using these incidents to stir up hysteria about the &#8220;darkies&#8221; who are &#8220;out to get us all&#8221; (his words). So you see, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many of these videos are posted, or if some of the flashmobbers themselves are quoted as saying that whites are easy prey.</p>
<p>All of these offense (including the crimes themselves) pale in comparison to our offense of having the bad taste to even notice the racial aspect of these crimes. That alone is enough to mark us as &#8220;racists.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If these black flash robberies continue, and they will, stores will respond. Convenience stores will have to build &#8220;safe&#8221; rooms that are concrete or steel for employees to lock themselves in during the robbery. Encasing the merchandise and clerks behind bullet proof glass and handing items and money through a secure drawer is another option. Maybe quick release bars to block the exits to hold the robbers. Chain stores can&rsquo;t give employees guns for obvious liability reasons. Independent store owners can and should arm themselves, which many already do. What is the result? Higher prices to pay for the increased security. Many blacks must use these stores for their everyday needs and these black flash robs will only cost the black communities the most in the end. I salute this young man for his bravery in the face of this ugly scene and hope he will recover from his injuries.</p>

If color had anything to do with it I would have to get rid of tons of things in my home as well as my dog. You may have darker skin than I but that means nothing, hell, right now it being the end of the summer here in my coastal town I can almost guarantee you I&rsquo;m close to as dark as you and maybe darker after spending all summer at the beach.</p>

		<p>This nonsense has to stop. The media is aiding and abetting this sort of behavior by treating blacks with kid gloves instead of tough criticism. Blacks know the media will not excoriate them. That&rsquo;s why this stuff continues. When Whites have had enough blacks will be in big trouble. Time is getting near. Civilized people don&rsquo;t like the large &#8220;no go&#8221; zones in the big cities. They  want to be able to go wherever they feel like w/o feeling intimidated. These barbarian actions also create an image that the black is a violent animal who needs to be segregrated from the rest of humanity.</p>

<p>A hate crime conviction for whites is often a de facto death sentence. Minorities are largely given more leniency because of some form of collective strength, ranging from brutal mobbing to economic dominance.</p>
<p>Whites seem to be masters at everything, but grandmasters at nothing, and too individualistic to reach the top anymore. The middle class is always the first to go in a collapse.</p>

		<p>I feel like this year especially, my eyes have been opened.  I learned of the new so-called &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; through Drudge Report and now I am seeing reports of these everywhere except, of course, television news.  It is correct that the media will not excoriate most black perpetrators, much less large groups of them.  I think the most obvious reason is because of political correctness.  However, it&rsquo;s starting to look like it&rsquo;s a cover-up designed, whether purposely or not, to hold down and hold back whites.  Do I believe the media is consciously covering up to prevent fear?  Partially.  Do I think the media are the ones most afraid of blacks and those that support them?  Absolutely.  With what&rsquo;s going on economically and in every other way, the liberal media&rsquo;s ideas of Utopia are going down the drain.  It&rsquo;s time for everyone to wake up and address this is a very real way.</p>

		<p>I love the Youtube segue to &#8220;related&#8221; clips at the end of the video. We get Obama&rsquo;s speech calling for &#8220;jobs for the poor youths.&#8221; Doesn&rsquo;t he want something like a half-trillion dollars to create jobs for &#8220;poor wretches&#8221; like we see in this video?</p>
<p>If I could edit the video of Obama&rsquo;s pathetic speech last night, I&rsquo;d place a blank screen behind Obama and Biden, and I would impose video loops of the countless, Countless, COUNTLESS flash-mob-payback-riots that are occurring in all our neighborhoods across this nation &hellip; all while the Clueless in Chief arrogantly demands that we responsible Americans fund his domestic Peace Corps project that will just put even more expensive Nikes on these punks&rsquo; feet. </p>
<p>Are the black &#8220;youths&#8221; of this nation (along with Obama and Holder) creating a war in which EVERYONE, save blacks, is for them fair game? </p>

<p>&#8220;Judge them not because of the color of their skin, but because of their character.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agreed with your post until you just had to say the infamous MLK phrase. Stop it!</p>
<p>The permanent color of one&rsquo;s skin is the sign of their RACE! That is how we distinguish which race they are to begin with along with their behavior, facial features, eyes, etc.</p>

		<p>When I was living in Nashville Tennessee back in the 1990&rsquo;s, I saw several convenience stores with a great security feature: a hillbilly sitting in a chair with a shotgun in his lap. It worked wonders in reducing shoplifting and ended the storeowner&rsquo;s problems with robberies altogether. I wonder how these &#8220;students&#8221; would have behaved if this store had this wonderful security device.</p>

Nobody said it doesn&rsquo;t happen in the South.  But it does happen more frequently in the North!  Wanna compare?  By my count, Philadelphia (at least 3 times), New York, DC (at least 3 times), Des Moines, Milwaukee, Chicago (at least 2 times), Peoria, and I know I&rsquo;m leaving a few out.  Now, let&rsquo;s hear your list of Southern flash mobs.</p>

<p>Hmmmm, well I agree with MOST of what you say.  However, I would say that most of us are also concerned with the survival of our race and retaining its genetic integrity.  That means a lot less inherent melanin than Sureesh.  Good behavior is not the only issue here.  Our fair skin, eyes, our features, hair and the eons of honorable tribal culture that comes with that is what we are ultimately looking to protect, not simply good behavior.  That is merely a condition expected for anyone who wishes to be around us or do any sort of business with us.  It is not an opened invitation to move in and marry up. As for Sureesh in particular, I think he has said that he is married, but it is not our problem that Indians and Chinese kill off their females at birth or now even before.  We don&rsquo;t owe them mates.</p>

		<p>Here is what is going to happen. A crowd of students will stage a flash mob assault on a Korean convenience store. The owner will open up with a 12 gauge Remington pump. The crowd will trample each other getting out. That night a horde of thugs will attack every Korean in sight and the cops will not intervene. Every big city will fall in with the mayhem. When all the blood is spent and buildings burned and looted, decent blacks will have no places to shop. We should bring our troops home from Afghanistan and have them patrol our cities and treat the students like Al Qaeda.<br>

		<p>I remember a time when shoplifters tried to avoid detection, and robbers wore masks. Now, &#8220;young people&#8221; seem to have no fear of being identified and caught. What changed?</p>
<p>Did the election of President Obama embolden the blacks? Is it poverty? </p>
<p>I know the answer to what emboldened the blacks: White People! </p>
<p>The problem is that white people tolerate this behavior. The average white person (not those at AmRen) fear the charge of racism. White people go through extraordinary linguistic gymnastics (&#8220;young people,&#8221; &#8220;youths,&#8221; &#8220;customers&hellip;&#8221;) to avoid being called racist. Non-whites are not nearly as sensitive. </p>
<p>The other problem is law enforcement. The prosecution is more likely to dismiss charges against another minority (Asian) protecting his/her store from blacks, but will probably press charges against a white person for doing the same. </p>
<p>Here is the solution: Don&rsquo;t open these types of convenience stores in black neighborhoods. Stores in black neighborhoods should be exterior window or counter sales only, with all merchandise behind the clerk. Retail designs that work in most neighborhoods don&rsquo;t work in black neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>Interesting how the news article failed to identify the race of the perps.  Of course, in our world today that&rsquo;s hardly necessary.  Anybody reading the piece would know automatically that this sort of crime would be the work of black Africans.  No other racial or ethnic group would behave in such a manner.  Not one.</p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s interesting how it&rsquo;s &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; and &#8220;race realist&#8221; sites like AmRen that are taking the lead on reporting and discussing this black mob phenomenon.</p>
<p>Think about it - if you&rsquo;re looking for the most update info on black mobs where whites are victims of violence, if you&rsquo;re looking for in-depth discussion and best places to find all the various sources of info all collected in one place - where are you going to start?</p>
<p>Are you going to look in the mainstream media? How about the online world of leftist/progressive political news and discussion? Are you going to start by looking on the SPLC website? </p>
<p>Even mainstream conservative news and opinion sites are barely covering the phenomenon.</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s the online &#8220;race realist&#8221; or pro-white sphere of sites that is leading the discussion on this black on white violence.</p>
<p>This is as clear cut of an example as one could ever ask to prove that it&rsquo;s going to take explicit pro-white advocacy in order to defend whites against anti-white racist violence and discrimination.</p>
<p>The mainstream media isn&rsquo;t going to do, and it certainly isn&rsquo;t going to come from the so-called &#8220;anti-racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>My suggestion to the owners and thinkers in the pro-white advocacy world is to keep the pressure on and to focus on this phenomenon like a laser. This is an issue where minds can be changed and people woken up from their colorblind stupor.</p>

		<p>Many years ago there was a dry cleaning chain in Houston Texas that was experiencing a number of armed robberies. To keep from going under, the owner hired guards to sit in the back of his stores with 12 gauge shotguns; he couldn&rsquo;t cover all of his stores so he rotated the guards randomly. The workers were instructed that if a robbery occurred when a guard was present, they were to drop to the floor and let the guard take over.</p>
<p>The dry cleaning owner then published ads in the local newspaper illustrating the results, showing the bloodiest photographs that the paper would allow,</p>
<p>It worked.<br>

		<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s only a regional TV commercial, but AT&T; runs a, in my opinion, vicious commercial redefining the term &#8220;flash mob&#8221; for information-ally retarded white people.</p>
<p>It begins by showing an idiotic, dumpy, vapidly stupid faced white guy breaking out into some kind of choreographic dance routine in a large, classic train station, after verifying that the station clock has chimed at noon. Non-whites and a white female look at him with pity and contempt. He stops his moronic dance, realizing that he is alone in it. His cell phone rings, he answers, and a text appears &#8220;FLASH MOB MOVED TO 12:30&#8221;. Voice over chimes in &#8220;Don&rsquo;t be the last to know.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t purchase bread for two cents from AT&T;, if I were starving to death, and they were the last source of sustenance on Earth.</p>
<p>How is it that black flash mobs are pulling this kind of near murderous rioting, from Philly to LA, and the liberals (mostly white, with some black and brown accomplices) in corporate big business and big advertising come out with this literal propaganda to redefine the true societal issue of &#8220;flash mob&#8221; activity.</p>
<p>I truly believe this commercial arises from liberal/leftist motivation, and not merely an attempt to sell a service by using &#8220;humor&#8221;; Let&rsquo;s sell AT&T; and also convince those inherently and perennially racist whites that these flash mobs they may have heard a whisper of (for the MSM treat them as non-existent) are merely an activity of bored, bohemian whites (supposedly pulling  pranks) and not hate filled, greed filled, near homicidal blacks, - the true face of a &#8220;flash mob&#8221;?</p>
<p>Am I the only one who notices this obnoxious, anti-white racist,<br>
falsely humorous commercial? Is my attitude, or what I read into such advertising propaganda, overwrought? Am I wrong to assume that liberals run big business and big advertising, and that they promote their world view through it, subtly and not so subtly?<br>
Am I wrong to see this kind of thing as a serious distortion of public discourse, designed to confuse the ignorant, tepid, and white guilt ridden? The questions aren&rsquo;t rhetorical. Perhaps I am nuts. Or overwrought.</p>
<p>Just asking.  <br>

		<p>#14 ATBOTL, where did you get the idea that people in the south say convenience stores don&rsquo;t get robbed there? We&rsquo;re hardly that arrogant. And it doesn&rsquo;t even make sense; being more blacks in the south it&rsquo;s only logical to follow that many of these robberies occur here. In Atlanta it&rsquo;s almost a weekly office pool betting on how many convenience stores will go down the coming weekend, and how many blacks will get shot/stabbed /arrested. I see this disgusting fad as a national disgrace; not a regional contest.</p>

		<p>There have been many flash mob attacks in the South this year, often reported on this very site:  the boy who was nearly beaten to death in SC, the attacks on the subway in Atlanta, several riots at amusement parks and Philadelphia like mobs in Richmond, Charleston and Greensboro.  As far as I can tell, the idea the South is some kind of haven from this stuff is completely false and merely wishful thinking.  We see this kind of blindness towards problems in ones own back yard a lot from conservative reactionary type whites.  For example, American conservatives will discus Muslim on white rapes in Europe, but the much larger number of black on white rapes in the US is taboo to them.  The people who do this are psychologically invested in the idea that their country/region is better than other whites and they can&rsquo;t acknowledge facts that would undermine this delusion.  </p>

<p>BTW, I don&rsquo;t care how many decent black folk you know I do not see them marching in the streets to protest black violence nor holding candlelight vigils for White victims at the hands of their &#8220;brothers&#8221;.  When I see tens of millions of the decent black folk doing this, then I will believe they are just as sickened by what their own are doing. Until then, cry me a river.</p>

<p>Southerners here on Amren and on other pro-white interent sites are always saying &#8220;that would never happen in the South&#8221; when a black on white crime is reported in other parts of the country.  It&rsquo;s a really bizarre thing to do because if they read this site, they are reading about black on white crimes happening in the South on a regular basis.  I can only surmise that some Southerners feel schadenfreude when other whites are hurt by blacks.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding.  You listed five incidents.  I listed 12 and forgot Pittsburgh, so make that 13.  Based on our sample size, my statement remains true: flash mobs have occurred more frequently (by a ratio of more than 2:1) in the North.  </p>
<p>By the way, I would like to see links for the Richmond and Atlanta flash mobs, as well as any other incident (in addition to the Carter Strange beating) that happened in Charleston.</p>

<p>There have also been violent black mobs in Miami(don&rsquo;t tell me that it&rsquo;s not part of the South, by that logic, NYC and Chicago are not part of the North either), Charlotte, Nashville(at an amusement park) and Myrtle Beach(Black Bike Week).  This is a nationwide problem and all whites need to be in this together.  We need to look at the situation realistically and not get side tracked by irrelevant centuries old disputes.  </p>
