	<p>September 7, 2011</p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>National Mix It Up at Lunch Day is set for Oct. 18, just six weeks away. Now is the perfect time to start planning to join thousands of other schools dedicated to creating inclusive climates where all students can thrive. </p>
<p>This Teaching Tolerance initiative, designed to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations, asks students to break out of their normal social circles and connect with someone new over lunch. It&rsquo;s a simple act with profound implications; social scientists have proven that positive interaction across racial and ethnic lines reduces prejudice. </p>
<p>Want to join a campaign with a 10-year track record that included more than 3,000 schools nationwide last year? </p>
<p>The first step is easy. Add your school to our online <a href="https://www.tolerance.org/mix-it-up/map?newsletter=TT090511">Mix It Up at Lunch Map</a>. </p>
<p>Right away, we&rsquo;ll start sending you links to free online materials to help you plan and enjoy Mix It Up at Lunch Day on Oct. 18, plus ideas to extend the Mix It Up energy throughout the year. (Want to find out more? Visit our <a href="https://www.tolerance.org/mix-it-up/faqs?newsletter=TT090511">FAQ page</a> about Mix It Up.) </p>
<p>Thanks for making a difference in your students&rsquo; lives. </p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p><br>
Maureen B. Costello<br>
Director, Teaching Tolerance</p>
<p><br>
[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: In their <a href="https://www.tolerance.org/mix-it-up/six-steps">&#8220;Six Steps to Mixing It Up at Lunch,&#8221;</a> the SPLC advises teachers and administrators planning the event to &#8220;Make It Festive.&#8221; One way to do so, they recommend, is a flashmob:</em></p>
<blockquote><strong>What about a flashmob?</strong>
<p>Consider a flashmob in the cafeteria, the week before the event.</p>
<p>At the elementary level, teachers and other staff members could perform the flashmob.</p>
<p>For middle and high schools, involve choirs or bands for a flashmob, then hand out fliers letting students know that Mix It Up at Lunch is coming next week.</p>
<p>(If you do a flashmob, capture it on video and post it on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Teaching-Tolerance/18586933445">Facebook page</a>!)</blockquote></p>
<p><em>Though we at AR expect few readers will participate in Mix It Up at Lunch Day, we would encourage readers to post videos of &#8220;flashmobs&#8221; as comments to various posts on the &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Teaching-Tolerance/18586933445?ref=ts&amp;sk=wall">Facebook page</a>.</em>]</p>

		<p>My son went to a middle school that was &#8220;diverse&#8221; and mixed up all the time, especially at lunch. These kids were all 6th graders but some of the black males had failed so many times that they were actually driving (legally) their own cars to school. One in particular was named &#8220;TaBosco&#8221;. He was over 6 feet tall and weighed maybe 350 pounds. Everyone was terrified of him. He would patrol the lunchroom tables and spear pork chops off the white kids&rsquo; plates, telling them &#8220;you don&rsquo;t need dat.&#8221; </p>
<p>We did not know this was going on until the end of the school year. That was the last grade our son was in public schools around here.</p>

<p>So they admit that &#8220;normal&#8221; means that kids choose to be with their own kind, despite all the encouragement to be diverse and inclusive?</p>
<p>What happens on the day after each of these National Mix It Up at Lunch Days?  What has their &#8220;10-year track record&#8221; done to effect change, if the same &#8220;problem&#8221; persists year after year?  Apparently, the answer is &#8220;nothing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Besides some black youths trying to sweet-talk white girls, I don&rsquo;t see much hope for interaction on this special day.  Let&rsquo;s just hope there are no fights.</p>

		<p>So, if you advocate children &#8216;mixing it up&rsquo; in the lunch room, like the SPLC, you&rsquo;re welcomed into the classroom as the embodiment of sensitivity. If you think we&rsquo;d best be cautious about &#8216;mixing it up&rsquo;, like American Renaissance, you&rsquo;re a hate-group. </p>

		<p>Looks like you can&rsquo;t have law enforcement without Diversity added as the dilution factorm, or &#8220;mix it up&#8221; factor, to be PC.  Watch for Gov. Deal to grovel and appoint a non-hertonormative African American woman of the blessed color to the panel:</p>

<p>Immigration enforcement panel attracts controversy</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday called on Gov. Nathan Deal to reconsider his decision to appoint anti-illegal immigration activist Phil Kent to the panel, saying Kent has a history of making &ldquo;deeply disturbing&#8221; comments about immigrants. During in an interview on Wednesday, the head of Georgia&rsquo;s Legislative Black Caucus also blasted the panel for not being more diverse. All seven of its members are white men.<br>

		<p>My old high school, from which I graduated 20 years ago, prided itself on diversity.</p>
<p>Yet at lunchtime everyone self-segregated.</p>

		<p>If I recall correctly,didn&rsquo;t a predominately White high school in New Hampshire try this last year? From what I was told it was clear that the kids were very uncomfortable with one another.  Again, this was an all White school.</p>
<p>The fact is that people (for the most part) are going to gravitate to like minded human beings. This goes beyond race. Athletes will associate with athletes. Beuatiful girls will associate with beautiful girls. Nerds with nerds, Gay kids with gay or other effeminite kids, rebels with rebels, rich kids with other rich kids and so on. Race is just but one small part of the equation.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that wealthy White kids would more like to associate with wealthy Black, Hispanic an Asian kids as opposed to working class or poor White kids. </p>

		<p>Funny. I work for a major university&rsquo;s admissions office. I sometimes make visits to high schools for recruitment purposes. I&rsquo;m a black male, but am completely aware of the diversity/multicultural hoax. I can&rsquo;t help but notice how all the students sit at tables by race. I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful, natural thing that doesn&rsquo;t take rocket science to realize it&rsquo;ll happen this way if no one/special-interest-group/ideology interferes. Surely I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir here, but this Mix-It-Up garbage is an attempt to make students feel bad for doing just that - what&rsquo;s natural. Eventually they&rsquo;ll require students to participate under the guise of being an advocate of multiculturalism.  </p>

		<p>Thank God I went to an all white high school.  This mix it up stuff is such propaganda even the left&rsquo;s favorite institute, Harvard, has admitted that this will do just the opposite.</p>
<p>But think about it fellow amreners, isn&rsquo;t this a good idea in actuality?  I try to find the good in all bad and here is my take on this:  Johnny and Susie get hit on, attacked, or robbed by LeQuan and Takeisha.  The result is they avoid them (and others like them) even more than before.  That hypothetical and mystery intrigue is gone, possibly forever.  A better result is for Johnny to stand up for himself.  Where I come from all the Johnny&rsquo;s stand up to the LeQuans.</p>
<p>Lastly, click on the link and scroll down to the last pic.  Look at what &#8220;they&#8221; think is &#8220;mixing it up&#8221;, a single white girl surrounded by a sea of darkies.  And for a little lol, look how comfortable she looks.</p>
<p>Tell these loons to send their kids to a public school in the inner city.  We all know their kids go to a lily white private school.</p>

		<p>But doesn&rsquo;t the innocence of childhood have kids naturally sit in endlessly diverse arrangements without being told?  They don&rsquo;t?! That can&rsquo;t be natural.  Then they must be taught to &#8220;mix it up&#8221;, at least for a single day.  If they don&rsquo;t like it they can go back to the way it was later.  And they will.  Black, white, Asian, Indians, Africans, Caribbeans, boys, girls, jocks, nerds, dweebs they all tend to self-segregate as they have common interests.  Many people know this.  A few even respect it.  And it isn&rsquo;t necessarily harmful.  A few might remember that freedom of association is Constitutionally guaranteed.</p>

If any further evidence is needed to establish that the multiculturalists are insane, this should do it. Is it just me, or does the use of the term &#8220;flashmob&#8221; when describing &#8220;mixing it up&#8221; invoke not only concern but alarm, especially when it involves the introduction of our white children to the brown hordes over lunch?   </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think integration should be forced. After all, with some exceptions, generally most blacks like to hang out with other blacks, most whites like to hang out with other whites, and so on. If an individual wants to sit with another person of another race, nobody&rsquo;s stopping them, but no one should be forced to sit with somebody in the name of diversity. </p>

		<p>I graduated high school last year and as expected, everyone self-segregated by race in the lunchroom. When I was in middle school, however, students couldn&rsquo;t sit wherever they pleased and had to sit at a certain table with the rest of their class. Well one day in 7th grade, our teachers told us that they had decided we could sit wherever we wanted in the cafeteria. Once everyone got seated, it ended up being one &#8216;black table&rsquo; while the rest were &#8216;white tables&rsquo;. My friend and I were certain that the privilege would be taken away. Sure enough, we were right. When the teachers were asked why, there was simply no explanation given, but all the students of every race knew why. </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even fathom why some people are unsatisfied unless people who are as different they could possibly be choose to mingle. </p>

		<p>I did a few Google searches about MIUALD last year.  The general trend was:  elementary school kids thought it was fun.  Middle school kids were ambiguous.  High school kids didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough for some high school students to find a group they are comfortable having lunch with.  It is abominable for the SPLC to indrude on the one segment of the school day when students are free to exercise a bit of personal choice.</p>

		<p>All of the racial segregation I saw in college was by the blacks and hispanics themselves.  They established no go areas for whites and threatened any whites in those areas with physical harm.  Hispanic men attacked white in coming freshmen beating white girls with pipes.  Huge black girls bullied and robbed oriental girls regularly.  Black jocks bullied white gays. Such was cultural diversity.  </p>

<p>In fact, just as they are encouraging public schools to make &#8220;mixing it up&#8221; official school policy, I think the SPLC should make it company policy that every SPLC employee must live IN a housing project and make it mandatory that they send their kids to majority poor black public schools.</p>

		<p>Some of the techniques used in this may have (?) stemmed from<br>
techniques used to expand socialization of same race children across social class strata?  Maybe also, just to encourage adolescents to expand their socialization a little beyond their <br>
mere elective social preferences.  One &#8220;program&#8221; that did expand white horizons about socialization with other whites that otherwise might not have been elective friends was  &mdash;    &mdash;  World War II!  In dealing with $PLC, it&rsquo;s sure important to separate (discriminate!) the meat from the poison in what they brew up.  But &#8220;growth&#8221; in all this can be nudged and encouraged  &mdash;  not coerced and contrived. It might be a course correction but not a change of orientation.  To stretch it into an interracial application is about like pushing a physical fitness program as having cloning potential.    <br>
The expensive materials to promote these programs are donated cost free to public schools.  Once a public school invests in trying out something, its official  pronouncements proclaim the investment of time and effort to have been worth it all  &mdash;  whatever is muttered in private.  About 85% of the average school system budget goes for staff salaries. And nobody ever<br>
admits to wasting money.    <br>
I&rsquo;d be surprised if some prisoners in prisons had not put together a sounder and more realistic program to help the Blacks and Whites avoid lose-lose situations until they can get out and each avoid the other.  There might be a good comedy routine to make out of Dees as a Tolerance Santa Claus.  But don&rsquo;t try it onstage. You&rsquo;ll get sued.  <br>

<p>Actually, the World Wars had a horrific effect on American Society.  Gentle, well-mannered, well-read, &#8216;Gentlemanly&rsquo; young men from Old Stock American homes (many just farm boys, but still far from rough or ignorant) were thrown in with rougher elements.  The Lowest Common Denominator, of course, prevailed, after the refined young men were terrorized by the immigrant hoodlums.</p>
<p>I knew an elderly lady who described her sons&rsquo; good English, prior to WWII (Mississippi&rsquo;s Scottish families can have a Brahmin accent far removed from the Cockneyesque, Dipthong-laden drawl so common in the state).  Well, both sons came back with atrocious accents, and unfortunate habits.  The Genteel was scared out of them by contact with ruffians.</p>

<p>Not exactly true. The poster has some merit. It is not that hard to believe that if a rich White person had to select associating with a Wealthy Black, Asian, Hispanic etc&hellip; person versus a lower income or poor White person, they would most likely associate with the wealthy non-White. Hell, even Paris Hilton associates with rich minorites as opposed to poor or lower income Whites.</p>

		<p>Those of us AMRENERS who are in our late 30s or older probably remember a movie &#8220;The Breakfast Club.&#8221; The movie was made in 1985. For those of you younger posters, it was a film about a group of upper middle class high school kids who had to spend a Saturday afternoon in detention.</p>
<p>There were five kids in all - The Jock, The Nerd, The Rebel, The Misfit and The Pretty Girl/Beauty Queen. They were three guys - the Nerd, Jock, Rebel and two girls - the misfit and pretty girl. All of the students were White. </p>
<p>Early in the day, they did everything they could to ignore one another. In fact, they freqeuntly insulted one another. However, as the day progressed, they began to open up to one another, shared lunches with one another, reveal very personal stories about their families and themselves to one another etc&hellip;. <br>
By the end of the day, they became friends. </p>
<p>However, one very important question was asked by the Nerd - <br>
&#8221; Will any of you speak to me on Monday morning?&#8221; All of them enthusiastically stated yes. He responded with &#8220;I would like to beleive you, but I wonder if you really will.&#8221;  As it was time to leave, they all hugged one another and walked out of the school together as their parents had arrived to pick them up. In fact, the misfit and the jock kissed one another and the pretty girl kissed the rebel and gave him one of her diamond earrings.  </p>
<p>The director of the film was the late John Hughes who died in 2007 I beleive. In a number of interviews, he said that the movie was cathartic for him in that he was able to come to grips with the social startification in the high school that he attended. I am assuming that his high school, was predominately, if not all White.</p>
<p>My point is that this movie was a classic example of a group of students being forced to deal with one another despite their intial dislike and distrust of one another. </p>
<p><br>
In a real life situation, it is probably safe to say that it would not be a stratch for the Jock and the pretty girl to become a couple or the rebel and the misfit to get together. Maybe even the nerd and the misift would be friends. In fact, that would not be all that unreasonable to fathom.</p>
<p>Although I would say that in all reality when Monday morning arrived, they probably did at least acknowledge one another in the hallways and went on about their business with their established cliques. But that was as far as it went. More than likely, no friendships developed among this group.</p>
<p>Human beings tend to be tribal regardless of race. Class, sexual orientation, looks, athlietic ability or lack of,  and in some cases, religion, region and in some case, common intersts are crucial factors. <br>
 <br>
As a few other posters mentioned, while race can be a factor,reality often transcends beyond race. <br>

<p>I do, too, but my thinking on it is a little turned around.</p>
<p>Not only should I not have to tolerate a person I don&rsquo;t get along with (no matter who they are), they don&rsquo;t have to put up with me if I choose to avoid them.  It&rsquo;s just plain stupid to force yourself on people who don&rsquo;t like you.</p>
<p>And sometimes, finding an in-group is harder than people think.  Anyone know where I can find more redneck pot-smoking atheist sci-fi fantasy fans who know the difference between &#8220;race&#8221; and &#8220;species&#8221;  and so have no problem recognizing racial differences and traits?</p>
<p>Yeah, pretty rare, eh?</p>
<p>Speaking as a person who is VERY uncomfortable around humans in general, that would be the group I would feel more immediately comfortable around.  My comfort level drops significantly the more changes are made to the above description.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the result of what in dogs would be called &#8220;improper socialization&#8221; as a child.  I think you can guess why; it was OK back in the 70s to still bully nerdy kids.</p>
<p>But these idiots think I should have no problem being friends with Pakistanis (which group I&rsquo;ve learned from experience to avoid like the plague).  </p>
<p>To be FORCED into social situations where I know I would feel extremely uncomfortable, well, wouldn&rsquo;t that be against _my_ freedom of association? (which of course, includes freedom FROM association.  Or should.)</p>

<p>I understood exactly what you meant. Your scenario is not factual, nor desirable.. Students in ANY school ALWAYS have kids of their own race, those who are (lower income, middle class, rich) to hang with. There is NEVER any reason to hang with blacks, etc. no matter how &#8220;rich&#8221; they are.</p>
<p>And yes, RACE does trump class. Maybe not to YOU, but to any honorable White person it is imperative.</p>

		<p>ref. Post #37.  I find your comments valuable and thoughtful.  I think the inducement is not actually money but some locally favorable publicity.  &#8220;Good ideas&#8221; like what TT purports to be,<br>
tend to get a lot of local commendation in the news, no matter whether upclose, as seen by actual participants, it comes off well or not.  Schools are notorious for the huge gap between reality and cultivated appearances.  In the case of $PLC I&rsquo;d surmise it just &#8220;oh coincidentally happens&#8221; that all sorts of local citizens start praising the program, no matter what the inner realities, and the local media also.  In school administration, looking good is basic to avoiding the moving van.<br>
Another sad payoff is that lots of teachers and lots of students welcome any special program that affords, say, three days relief from paragraph writing, etc.  A larger issue surrounds this.  Upclose Dee$&rsquo; operations are a little like the dye used in radiology to detect body malfunctioning.  The upclose, detailed look at his effects upon police departments (Intelligence function), schools (Teaching Tolerance), and on the legal system as a whole (abuse of legal process court cases<br>
aimed to use the law to hammer on people merely because of their opinions and advocacies )   ought to be  &mdash;  ought to be  &mdash;  a major political science focus.  I&rsquo;d go so far as to say the approprite parts of the national security entities of our potential international adversaries  &mdash;  Iran, China, Russia, etc.  &mdash;  would seek to know all they can about $PLC just in terms of what the awareness would reveal about how vulnerable many of our insitutions are to infiltration and perverse manipulation.  </p>

Almost certainly an upclose, detailed awareness of Dees&rsquo; Mix It Up Program would reveal elements of merit that would be of interest to high school students, especially.  That is to say,<br>
children in the constraints of schools are centrally interested<br>
in social groups, social dynamics, patching up quarrels and reducing frictions.  Any program addressing all this is bound<br>
to attain some success.  Obviously, such success would be as salient in an all-White Idaho high school as anywhere else.  We can safely assume that race is simply something $PLC insinuates<br>
into all this (Dare I say, &#8220;grafts upon it&#8221; )   Social relationships that are constrained or somewht coerced are, sadly, a fact of life in high schools, most workplaces, and college campuses are especailly &#8220;that way&#8221;.  In the real world, &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; as the mechanical engineer understands it and productively deals with it is one thing.  &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; as a manipulative verbal engineer peddles it and exploits it, is something else.  Getting involved in knowing the real details of the Dees&rsquo; programs is a favor we would do our movement.  Getting the realism of the mechanical engineer infused into it all, could stand Dees on his head. After all, &#8220;Tolerance&#8221; as it comes to be imperfectly practiced from out of the &#8220;school of hard knocks&#8221; in our prisons by the abler prisoners, is something of a favor to both Blacks and Whites and prevents lose-lose encounters and hopefully leads to the groups being able to abandon Tolerance AFTER  they get away from each other upon parole <br>
 I assume it is legally permissible for a student to wear a concealed digital audio recorder during these Dees&rsquo; TT programs? If so, gathering the details that way would be useful.<br>
Beyond that, I presume it is not legally actionable to explicitly and clearly modify the Dees&rsquo; TT program to bring it into accord with reality.  I sure know it would not be welcome in the Poverty Palace in Alabama.  Managing to &#8220;boomerang&#8221; Dees&rsquo;<br>
TT program would be a very big gain.  We would expect this to demonstrate that what works and is of merit in Dees&rsquo; TT is not new or related closely at all to the professed  &mdash;  professed  &mdash;  $PLC mission. What is unique to Dees&rsquo; TT, is probably not really workable and cries out to be cut loose.  </p>

<p>It would be interesting to note, if the reliable information could be extracted, how many schools once participating have ended up just keeping the Teaching Tolerance materials on the shelf gathering dust or have &#8220;lost&#8221; such materials (products not purchased are easily thrown away; those that are purchased present certain legal ripples against just tossing them readily into the dumpster)  </p>
<p>School administrators, while making all manner of overt and &#8220;positive&#8221; comments, often wish to get rid of various Trojan Horses and they have lots and lots of devious little ways of doing so.  I&rsquo;d bet that  much of TT is jettisoned even if the program on the face of things seems to be carried out year and after year.  It is not simple to get at the real facts within the functioning of schools  &mdash;  the moreso for a topic connected to race and involving $PLC.  </p>

		<p>A topic rather basic to this strand is the nature of school psychologists in America.  From federal laws implemented <br>
more than 30 years ago, all public school systems have school psychologists.  Yet with rare exception, school psychology programs in most states exist under the roof of Schools of Education.  Accordingly, admission standards are too low and the emphases almost studiously evade, if they do not overtly discredit and scorn, psychological research establishing the importance of genes and of human evolution to the understanding and accommodation of human differences and overlapping group differences.  While there are numerous exceptions, school psychologists contain probably the highest incidence of any domain of psychology of neo-Lysenko Blank Slate adherents.  <br>
Thus, a dubious program like $PLC&rsquo;s &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; is less likely than otherwise to be greeted with realistic skepticism.        </p>

		<p>Re  #37<br>
Probably the big factor is that it is hard to refuse to cooperate with something that sounds so good.  Too, I suspect $PLC operates through influential parents and others who approach the school<br>
districts? Also, the same local proponents can usually bring about a good bit of good looking local publicity about a program, even if in reality it does not fly very well.  I&rsquo;d say, the best barometer is whether over time, the school phases out the TT effort or whittles it down to be mainly an appearance instead of a time-demanding big deal.  I doubt that the program as promoted<br>
by $PLC bears much acquaintance over time within most schools?? </p>

<p>I&rsquo;d imagine that some of the group dynamic stuff works well and especially in racially homogenous settings.  Up to a point students in middle school and high school will give regard to anything that modifies, or aligns, or adjusts their social group dynamics.  Dees is probably just &#8220;grafting&#8221; onto this a lot of politically inspired ramifications into areas like race and homosexuality, etc.  If a person ever got a clear inside detailed picture of a few of these urban efforts you allude to, it would likely &#8220;speak volumes&#8221; about the real $PLC.   </p>

<p>Not exactly true. The poster has some merit. It is not that hard to believe that if a rich White person had to select associating with a Wealthy Black, Asian, Hispanic etc&hellip; person versus a lower income or poor White person, they would most likely associate with the wealthy non-White. Hell, even Paris Hilton associates with rich minorites as opposed to poor or lower income Whites.</p>

No, it is a bad point.</p>
<p> Paris Hilton, Kardasian sisters, movie stars, models, etc. are such airheads and could care less about the White race (most are jews anyway) and I will wager even they do not include &#8220;rich&#8221; blacks in their everyday lives, or &#8216;hang&#8221; with them, except for the race traitors of course. And most of Hollywood is full of race traitors and are immoral beyond belief.</p>
<p> NO rich person, black or white, hang with any poor, within or without, their own race so what is your point? This is why I say your &#8220;examples&#8221; are flawed. flawed. Please name all the rich Whites who have rich blacks in their lives or even as dear friends? Except for the race traitors, that is. Do you personally even any know rich White people and their daily goings on? </p>

You misunderstood what I said. I was saying that if a wealthy White kid was in a situation where they were limited to associating solely with upscale Blacks (eg&hellip;the Huxtables of the Cosby Show, Sidney Poitier etc&hellip; or lower income Whites (Dog The Bounty Hunter, The Conner Family on Roseanne etc&hellip;, they would most likely entertain the idea of befriending The Huxtables over Dog the Bounty Hunter.</p>
<p>My point is class frequently trumps race. <br>

<p>I understood exactly what you meant. Your scenario is not factual, nor desirable.. Students in ANY school ALWAYS have kids of their own race, those who are (lower income, middle class, rich) to hang with. There is NEVER any reason to hang with blacks, etc. no matter how &ldquo;rich&rdquo; they are.</p>
<p>And yes, RACE does trump class. Maybe not to YOU, but to any honorable White person it is imperative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not always. I consider myself an (to use your term),honorable  White person and I would certainly be more inclined to associate with a Colin Powell, Bill Cosby type of Black person before I would do so with a lower income, shiftless type of White person. The type of fellow Whites my grand parents use ot refer to as &#8220;White Trash.&#8221;</p>

Not entirely true. I have a nephew who graduated from Oberlin <br>
College in 2007. He was an athlete who played football. I went to see several of his games over the years.  Occasionally, I would meet some of his buddies. Several were Black and Hispanic guys. In fact he informed me that he was very close with one of the Hispanic guys and two of the Black guys. Of course, he had many White friends as well. </p>
<p>Once, I diplomatically asked him how did he manage to make so many friends across different ethnic backgrounds. He responded that given the fact that they &#8220;worked, played and sweated together,&#8221;  that they were almost like &#8220;brothers&#8221; to him. That was the word he used, &#8220;brothers. His two older biological brothers are my nephews as well. The fact that my sister and her former hippie husband who are few years younger than me, have always been those tree hugging types. such an environment has probably also influenced him as well.  </p>
<p>In fact, I just spoke with him last month at a family reunion and he mentioned to me that he was in the wedding party of one of his former Black teammates. </p>
<p>My nephew is an honorable (to use your term), decent, hard working, successful young man. He earned his masters degree in communications from Syracuse University in 2009. He is only 27 years old has a very good job working in television for a major network. I am proud of him.</p>
<p>I guess what I am saying is that situations and certain commmonalities can occasionally override basic, generic traits such as racial identity. </p>
<p>Some of our fellow AMREERS are correct in this regard.   </p>

<p><i>All of the racial segregation I saw in college was by the blacks and hispanics themselves. They established no go areas for whites and threatened any whites in those areas with physical harm. Hispanic men attacked white in coming freshmen beating white girls with pipes. Huge black girls bullied and robbed oriental girls regularly. Black jocks bullied white gays. Such was cultural diversity.</i></p>

<p>I really do not care that you consider your nephew honorable, decent etc. That is your take on the situation. He, in my opinion, can be a great guy but I will always draw the line when it comes to interracial &#8220;friendships&#8221; because it will always lead to miscegenation eventually and there is a line that cannot be crossed IF you want to ensure the survival of your own race.</p>
<p>Being &#8220;friends&#8221; across racial lines leads the White person down a path of no return. Their OWN race and it&rsquo;s survival becomes meaningless in their minds. They will ALWAYS defend their nonwhite friends over their White friends if they detect their White friends are &#8220;racist&#8221;. See what I am getting at? </p>
<p> They will ALWAYS think that the races can get along (just because he does), thereby ensuring a multicult society that we now have and most of us can see the devastating results. It is called White genocide whether you or he ever admits it. It will happen.</p>

and &#8220;modification&#8221; of typical lunch room seating ( and there is<br>
each day a clear tendency to eat with or near the same students)<br>
this leads to discovering new social affinities.  That&rsquo;s not breaking news  &mdash;  e.g.,  when a new student enters school from moving into the community, it can notably reconfigure the social groupings he/she enters.  It would seem likely that $PLC is merely &#8220;grafting&#8221; onto something valid, a racial pie-in-the-sky promise that is so politically potent it tends to be immune to skepticism or even realism.

Almost all States have counterparts to the Federal Freedom of<br>
Information Act.  There are &#8220;do&rsquo;s&#8221; and &#8220;dont&rsquo;s&#8221; to be aware of <br>
before submitting an information request to a school district,<br>
and a &#8220;cost ceiling&#8221; is sure one.  But in our state any citizen of the State has standing to make a request of any public school district  &mdash;  not merely the one within which he legally resides.  It ought to be fairly simple to find out whether a school district is participating in the &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; program of $PLC.  Too, it is useful to ask how much staff time is devoted<br>
to it by unnamed  individuals (teacher A, teacher B, support staff A&hellip;) and what the salary/ or hourly wage of the staff person is.  It is awkward for a school district to charge much or anything for providing such information since matters of allocation of time and money are &#8220;front burner&#8221; in the eyes of boards of education and are expected exist at fingertip  &mdash;  not to be something that needs to be extracted and then involving search costs, etc. .   A request like this brings to a school district  superintendent/ a school building principal/  the burden of knowing what&rsquo;s going on within any TT program.  It also gives a nice pretext for whittling the program down to see how it floats in a small pilot effort or how it can be partly implemented here and there and now and then or how, nowadays, it is a luxury that can&rsquo;t be afforded.     </p>

The fact is that no one can &#8220;tell&#8221; consenting adults who they can date, marry or engage in sex with. The majortiy of people will do what they want to do. So your question is moot. </p>

		<p>IRS or its counterpart in some of our states might (eventually?) be stimulated to examine $PLC&rsquo;s tax status with regard to the<br>
content of Teaching Tolerance.  If truly expert opinion would reveal that TT is based on the implicit and/or explicit evasion<br>
and denial of relevant contemporary science  &mdash;  that reveals it to be a lot like political opinion and political dogma masquerading as applied science.  TT and all the appeals for small donations are just largely so much facade and decoy.  The essence of $PLC is a tax status that permits fat cat donors with feverish passions to pay for &#8220;hit man&#8221; retaliations against those whose views they detest  &mdash;  retaliations by way of perversion of legal process and perversion of law enforcement process in order to damage or destroy livelihoods, reputations, social relationships,etc.   </p>

<p>No, the question is not moot.</p>
<p> If Whites have no concept of racial survival and what it takes to ENSURE it, then they probably are not really &#8220;White&#8221; in the true sense of the word to begin with.  So, I say good riddance. Don&rsquo;t need them and don&rsquo;t want them. Is that &#8220;moot&#8221; enough for you?</p>

Actually, I see nothing wrong with race mixing as long as it does not lead to miscegenation. I also agree with those posters who state that people of different races can be friends without being sexually involved.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Really? I do not buy into that &#8220;theory&#8221;.</p>
<p> Being &#8220;friends&#8221; means that you have no inkling of racial solidarity or of our INSTINCT to ensure our survival. You cannot be &#8220;friends&#8221; with those who, as a collective, wants you and your kind, dead. I do not care &#8220;how nice&#8221; some individual blacks SEEM to be, they are NOT on our side. Yes, it will come down to whose side wins.</p>
<p>You did not answer that question about how your black &#8220;friends&#8221; would react if YOU declined to date their brother, sister, friend or cousin?  What would YOU say? </p>

<p>NO rich person, black or white, hang with any poor, within or without, their own race so what is your point? This is why I say your &ldquo;examples&rdquo; are flawed. flawed. Please name all the rich Whites who have rich blacks in their lives or even as dear friends? Except for the race traitors, that is. Do you personally even any know rich White people and their daily goings on?</p>
<p><br>
The poster does make a good point.</p>
<p>It is probably safe to say that Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice are wealthy Blacks who have a number of White friends and admirers for that matter. It is well known that Oprah Winfrey, another wealthy Black peron (a billionaire according to Forbes Magazine) has numerous White friends, both entertainers and private citizens with whom she associates. Meryl Streep is very good friends with Angela Bassett. Famous Black astropysist Nigel DeTyson is good frineds with Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Do you consider all these people race traitors?<br>

<p>Yes. Don&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
No. I don&rsquo;t. However, I do consider you irrational. </p>

Reportedly, at one point the &#8220;Teaching Tolerance&#8221; program of<br>
$PLC emphasized tolerance toward homosexuals ?  It is difficult to <br>
imagine that the arrogant lefties in the $PLC &#8220;Poverty Palace&#8221; realized all the hidden holes and speed bumps, as it were,  that are built into that topic within the inner-functioning of typical public schools.  More reason to find out what&rsquo;s happened.</p>
