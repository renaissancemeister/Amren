<h1><a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/09/mexico-el-chapo-guzman-emma-coronel-twins-lancaster-antelope-valley.html">MEXICO: Drug Lord&rsquo;s Wife Has Twins in Los Angeles County Hospital</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, September 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The spaces for &#8220;Name of Father&#8221; are blank. But the L.A. County birth certificates list the mother, who happens to be the young wife of one of history&rsquo;s biggest and most sought-after drug lords, Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman.</p>
<p>Emma Coronel traveled to Southern California in mid-July, and on Aug. 15 gave birth to twin girls at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, according to birth records and a senior U.S. law enforcement official.</p>
<p>Turns out Coronel, a 22-year-old former beauty queen, holds U.S. citizenship, which entitles her to travel freely to the U.S. and to use its hospitals. By being born to a U.S. citizen, not to mention in California, her little girls now also have U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Guzman, 54, the multibillionaire fugitive head of the Sinaloa cartel, married Coronel the day she turned 18 at a lavish wedding in the highlands of central Mexico in 2007. She is believed to be his third or fourth wife and is a niece of Ignacio &#8220;Nacho&#8221; Coronel, a one-time partner of Guzman who was killed in July 2010 in a shootout with the Mexican army.</p>
<p>U.S. federal agents apparently kept tabs on Emma Coronel even before she crossed the border at Calexico, through her hospital stay and until she left the country to return to Mexico. Although her husband tops most-wanted lists on both sides of the border, Coronel was not arrested because there are no charges against her, the law enforcement official said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. authorities have placed a $5-million bounty on Guzman&rsquo;s head and allege he and the Sinaloa cartel now control the bulk of cocaine and marijuana trafficking into the U.S. from Mexico and Colombia. {snip}</p>

<p>The point being those Mexican twins will now be anchor babies! Path to citizenship&hellip;. Yea, two more drug kingpin babies that will get amnesty.</p>
<p>We have allowed the race traitor government of ours to get away with replacing us (Whites) for far too long. They need to be put on trial for genocide. Doesn&rsquo;t any White care anymore? </p>

		<p>Antelope Valley is not a free county hospital.  That is good.</p>
<p>It has a very well regarded maternity program.  One would hope she paid her bills with her husband&rsquo;s ill gotten gains instead of medi-caid.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately for us, the mother is a U.S. citizen, so the babies are citizens too.  Does anyone know if Perry supports anchor babies?  It seems like he supports most of the LaRaza agenda. </p>

		<p>Sorry, call me Rick  &mdash;  I can&rsquo;t see the relevance of much of anything other than that two twin babies of essentially white background (?) and from a pretty good gene pool,  got better entry into the World  in the US than appears to have been available to them elsewhere.  It might be step one is enabling them to lay hold of <br>
better oars than their parents have thus far managed to do.  Let&rsquo;s focus on our enemies.   </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve aways understood why the Authors of The Constitution made sure there was a provision outlawing bills of attainder.</p>
<p>Now,having said that,I&rsquo;m beginning to understand why and how bills of attainder might have caught on in the first place. The idea is one that tempts.</p>

		<p> This shows what a worldwide joke our immigration laws have become, where a Third World drug lord/criminal can give his children citizenship simply by having his wife give birth to them in an American hospital. Its incidents like this that make me think that we are doomed as a civilized European style country.</p>

<p>Gotta hand it to Taylor as he is becoming a comedian in his cynicism and needs to apply for his own cable show to rival the 2 idiots Stewart and Cobert. </p>
<p>Seriously dude, another 3 hrs of that stuff and you could easily be called an amatuer comedian and get your own Fox comedy show as a first. </p>
<p>Imagine that. A conservative comedy show? Hey its a thought. </p>

<p>Did you see the pictures of the father?  Lots of indian there.<br>
He is one of the major criminals of the Americas.  The mother may be normal.  The father&rsquo;s genes are criminal. <br>

		<p>To the posters arguing about whether these creatures possess &#8216;good Genes&rsquo;, etc., I would like to say:</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t need people who are &#8220;essentially white&#8221;.  We need people who are REALLY white.  The farther our population moves from the Northwest European genetics of our Founding Stock, the less American America will become.  </p>
<p>Guzman is surprisingly hot looking.  Maybe Corola is, too.  I can&rsquo;t tell when women are pretty.  Can&rsquo;t see her for all the makeup, anyway.  But &#8216;hot&rsquo;, and even &#8216;smart&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t enough.  Northwest Europeans are wired for so many traits essential for making First World nations what they are (or, maybe, were&hellip;).  Honesty is one of those traits.  Altruism is another.  We don&rsquo;t need any more swarthy, ruthless, selfish &#8220;almost white&#8221; people in America.  People like that have already transformed East Coast banking, from the envy of the World, into a toxic sludge of greedy, kleptocrat Guttersnipes.  Most of the East Coast, in general, could be described that way, now.  And kids from &#8220;essentially white&#8221; East Coast families transformed Tulane, during the years I was there, from a nice school, into a distinctly vile milieu.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m &#8220;essentially white&#8221;, myself.  And I say, no more people like me, please!  We need sweet, kindly, honest, productive people of Northwest European descent.</p>

		<p>Now that the cartels have achieved a level of integration with the Latino prison gangs (e.g. Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia, Border Brothers, etc&hellip;) and the armies of Latino gangs that serve them; it&rsquo;s time to expand. </p>
<p>Sending female family members across the border to have Cartel children on U.S. soil is the logical next step to expanding their operations within the U.S..</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. government isn&rsquo;t going to do anything about this and, in fact, is busy filing lawsuits against states seeking to enforce federal immigration law because the federal government is against enforcing federal immigration law. Doesn&rsquo;t make much sense but that&rsquo;s the reality we live in.</p>

		<p>ref. 14  &mdash;  -Choice is also involved.  A few key choices and the skills to run a cartel are hugely applicable to keeping a chain of luxury Hotels solvent and booming  &mdash;  or being President of the US. Ask John Edwards or Bernie Madoff (what a name!!).<br>
ref, 13.  No.  Thanks for the tip.  He&rsquo;s got &#8220;that Eskimo look&#8221;<br>

		<p>Makes me sick - instead of that of hardworking, white individuals, it&rsquo;s the seed of criminal, drug-dealing gangbangers that get to propage the &#8220;future&#8221; of the world.</p>
<p>If there ever was a case where aiding a &#8220;miscarriage&#8221; was valid, it&rsquo;s in cases like these.</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t you read who the Father is?  He is one of the most powerful drug lords of mexico.  What kind of genes has he passed on to his daughters.  Remember that genes go to the children of the opposite sex.  Girl&rsquo;s are more like their Fathers.  Boys are more like their Mothers. Those are not the kind of genes we need in America. </p>
