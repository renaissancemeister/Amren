<h1><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/270465/EU-bans-border-controls">EU Bans Border Controls</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ted Jeory, Express, September 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brussels is poised to veto demands for emergency border controls from countries fearing mass immigration from North Africa.</p>
<p>France led pleas for greater sovereignty over borders as migrants fled Egypt and Tunisia at the height of the Arab Spring earlier this year.</p>
<p>Countries wanted to relax some of the rules that allow passport-free travel in 25 European countries.</p>
<p>Britain, along with Ireland, is not a part of the Schengen Agreement zone, but Tory MEPs were concerned over the implications of an exodus on immigration here via Calais.</p>
<p>They are calling on Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May to ensure Britain pushes for major longer-term reform of the agreement.</p>
<p>However, the European Commission is expected to announce proposals on Friday that fall short, saying that permission from Brussels will be required if member states wish to re-erect border crossings in the event of a crisis.</p>
<p>Controls would then be limited to five days. Any extension would require approval by a majority of EU states.</p>
<p>It means that the borders of sovereign countries will effectively be determined by other states.</p>
<p>The European Commission believes this is the only way that &#8220;mutual trust&#8221; between Schengen countries, and the free flow of goods it is designed to promote, can be maintained. However, Timothy Kirkhope, a Tory MEP and a former Immigration Minister, said Brussels was simply meddling in what should be domestic affairs.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;The European Commission has not listened. Governments are not asking for their borders to be closed, just to manage who enters at certain times, which is completely reasonable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Protecting borders is a fundamental task of any government and it seems wrong that they must ask permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Schengen is completely outdated. We need reforms that continue to allow EU citizens unimpeded travel but which allow governments to control large flows of immigration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The control of migrants into one EU country has implications on the flow of migrants into the whole of Europe, including the UK. What happens in Calais and Normandy affects us and it is in our interests to allow countries on our doorstep to regain control over large flows of migrants, many of whom will ultimately be destined for the UK.&#8221;</p>
<p>This year a row broke out between Italy and France when 20,000 Tunisians arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa.</p>
<p>Other countries declined to share the burden and Italy ushered them on trains to France which sent them back.</p>

		<p>About time too ! I live in a small rural town in England, however I cant walk from my house to Tescos (300 yards) without hearing foreign languages. Frequently I cant even hear an English speaker on the walk.  </p>

		<p>Many of the members of the EU Parliament are former Communist officials from Eastern Europe and elsewhere. If you haven&rsquo;t seen them before, check out the YouTube videos of Nigel Farage (UKIP) lambasting them during various parliamentary sessions over the years. If Europe doesn&rsquo;t regain its sanity and withdraw from the EU, they&rsquo;re going down. It may be too late for them already.</p>

		<p>Any sovereign nation that thinks it has to beg some foreign super-authority for permission to protect its own borders is already far gone along the path to complete and abject servitude.  For Europe, this is the point at which they must begin to stop learning to love their chains and stand up.  One way or another, this is likely to be a turning point.  It only remains to be seen in which direction.<br>

		<p>What utter rubbish.  Put troops on your border and problem solved.  They are not going to go to war because the borders are closed to the third world invasion of Europe.  Get some back bone and defend your country or perish.  Is your culture and history worth preserving or not?  To arms they are coming in limitless numbers to bury you in tribalism and ignorance.</p>

		<p>Good God, it is eery to see how collectivism rolled over Europe like a death shroud, choking off all reason and sanity&hellip;in the direct wake of the collapse of the soviet union.<br>
Simply mind - boggling. <br>
Can a European here comment on what went on in the minds of the victors of that long cold war, that would lead them to dive deeper than the Soviet Empire did?<br>

		<p>No. 6 Anonymous - &#8216;what went on in the minds of the victors&rsquo; indeed.  If you scroll down to the September 9th page of this blog - the last item by Mr. Taylor suggests that America has the same problems.  Our nations have been overrun with immigrants and we have been forbidden to express concern.  Our freedom of speech has been stolen, our right to determine what our own country will look like also.  I read blogs such as this to try and find out &#8216;why&rsquo;.  We British did not vote to join the strait jacket EU - we voted to join the Common Market which was sold to us as a trading pact only - no mention was made (deliberately) of political union, no border controls, joint military, European Parliament, Law Courts, etc.  When all political parties in your country are singing from the same hymn sheet where do you go?  You can see on another part of this blog what happens to people (the EDL) when they stand up and demand their  indigenous rights.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union - there are 1 to 2 million Muslims in Moscow right now - check it out on YouTube.  They recently had a demonstration to demand more mosques.  Same modus operandi as everywhere else.  Have to admit I was surprised the Russian authorities put up with it - but they did, like we do!</p>
<p>Sadly I think we have lived through the best of times and things will get a lot worse.</p>

		<p>This brings to mind a conversation I had with a liberal not long ago.</p>
<p>With regards to immigration, his dismissive argument was that Tokyo and Singapore were far more crowded than our cities, yet livable, therefore we have a long way to grow before we have to worry.</p>
<p>His conviction was that Europe and North America can both absorb millions more people and the consequences will be managable.   This fantasy satisfies both the velvet Marxists of the ideological left and the capitalist speculator.  </p>
<p>All they care about is growth, which they see as inherently &#8216;good&rsquo; for them.</p>

		<p>I once thought that the idea of a unifying organization of European countries was a great idea.  It&rsquo;s turned out to be a nightmare because somehow, it was co-opted by flagrant Marxists with a mission to destroy all the history, culture, and peoples of Europe.  I hope that the various European nations wake up and reject the EU.  The currency is the only real binder and it is on pretty shaky ground.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Is it the baby boomers reliving their radical days one last time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Please try to keep in mind that not all of the baby boomers are liberals, nor  bleeding hearts. Personally, I am on of them and some of you may recognize my less than tolerant comments here and on other sites. I advocate pre-emptive strikes, no prisoners and no welfare, NO immigration, NO MUSLIMS!!!! and ZERO tolerance of black misconduct. I am one of the original &#8220;kill em all, let god sort em out&#8221; LRRPS and have walked in the vallys of death. There were almost NO draftees in any of the units in which I served and those that were, usually re-enlisted and got a change of RA to their service number. During the Vietnam war, those of us that were volunteer had service numbers that began with RAxxx, national guard=NG, Reserves=ER and draftees were USxx in the Army at least this was what happened, I don&rsquo;t know about other branches of service. Another point to consider, the basic language of the U.S. Army is no longer English, it is Spanish and how effective do you think an Army of Spanish speaking Mexicans (legal or illegsl) in the U.S. Army is going to be at keeping their relatives out of the U.S.? The other most spoken language (if you want to call it that) is ghettoese/Ebonics by the tremendous number (I would say 60%) of barely literate blacks in the U.S. Army and that uniform basically gives them a hunting license for White females in the Army, though even black females are not free of their assaults. Having so many foreign troops or troops with loyalties to other than the U.S. is what happened to ROME!</p>
