<h1>Man Admits Sending Threatening KKK Letters in Illinois</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>KMOV (St. Louis), September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Sentencing will be held in January for a black man who admits posing as a member of the Ku Klux Klan in sending racist letters in 2006 to a police department and city hall in his former southwestern Illinois hometown of O&rsquo;Fallon.</p>
<p>Justin Kidd, 28, pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court in East St. Louis to charges of conveying false threats in O&rsquo;Fallon.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say Kidd mailed a letter to the O&rsquo;Fallon Police Department in November 2006 that threatened to burn down an apartment complex if blacks were not barred from living there.</p>
<p>Another letter to O&rsquo;Fallon City Hall a week later pledged to burn down the houses of blacks there if they weren&rsquo;t purged from the city.</p>

		<p>Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza noted this in &#8216;illiberal education&rsquo;. Many of these racial &#8216;incidents&rsquo; on campus are created by leftists themselves. When revealed as a hoax the love-fest continues because it helped highlight a &#8216;neglected&rsquo; issue and also because, after all, such an ugly incident could have happened. </p>

		<p>Gee, I wonder if hate crimes charges will also be filed by Eric Holder &amp; Co.? If a white man wrote the letters it would be considered violating the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; of blacks.  <br>

		<p>Notice the original article - Channel 4 (KMOV) doesn&rsquo;t show you a picture of the black hoax artist, but shows you representative images of K people.  Of all the St. Louis media outlets, KMOV&rsquo;s TV news has been the worst when it comes to race for some time, even worse than the Post-Dispatch.</p>

		<p>I bet when this happened the media had a field day blaming the poor K and Whites in general. Bet they didn&rsquo;t make any effort to follow it up when they found out it was a black.</p>
<p>It is ALWAYS blacks who commit these hoaxes. The same with a few other ethnic groups also&hellip; blaming Whitey (especially WNs etc.)is the name of the game.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t help but be reminded of this crossburning in CA last March (story link below). My first thought was that it was more likely committed by a black or hispanic than by a white.  It was investigated by the FBI&hellip;apparently the case went cold. Either that or they found out a white didn&rsquo;t do it. There&rsquo;s been no follow up on this one since.</p>

		<p>A few years ago a young black teenager in West Alabama &#8220;borrowed&#8221; his aunt&rsquo;s car for a joy ride. Luckily he didn&rsquo;t kill anyone but wound up in a ditch. In an attempt to hide his little escapade, he spray painted &#8220;KKK&#8221; and &#8220;n*****s out&#8221; on the car. When the police questioned him (in the presence of his aunt) the car keys were in his pocket.</p>

<p>Actually, there was no coverage around here of the initial incident aka hoax.  I have a sensitive antenna about those sorts of news stories, but when it comes to feel good stories about &#8220;local high school students organize a 5K run to cure lymphoma,&#8221; I don&rsquo;t really pay much attention.  If there was any local media coverage of the actual incident, I would have remembered it, but I remember nothing of the sort.</p>

		<p>NOT only are a preponderance of these incidents hoaxes and perpetrated by &#8220;minorities&#8221;, but that these folks, the perps, are so easily tripped up and make to admit their guilt. And my impression is that the perps take a perverse and malicious pleasure of causing such a ruckus just for the sake of doing so. The mentality behind such acts is just very unsound.</p>

		<p>Be assured that this was not reported outside the geographic area where it happened. This is the first I heard of it. </p>
<p>But then, there was a News video attached to the current page of cofcc.org which told of the Robbery and Execution murder of a White couple that grew up together. They were murdered while walking in a Park in Oklahoma. No Front Page News, here! </p>
<p>Again, This is the first time that I head of it. But do you know what I heard about, endlessly? The Duke Rape Case hoax, which was drum beaten by the Liberals and their Propaganda machine forever.</p>
<p>The five White Lacrosse Students of Duke were smeared, and that whore got away with filing a False Police Report, and Inciting to Riot, etc.. I don&rsquo;t recall this Tramp getting any Jailtime. </p>
<p>The accused White men had to leave and start over at other Universities, while their parents have to pay, after refinancing their homes, to provide for their Legal Defense. </p>
<p>I could also mention a hoax at Columbia University, where a &#8220;Black Studies Professor&#8221; was seen on Security video tape, placing a noose on her own Office door knob. What a genius. </p>
<p>Yet, Whites across this country put up with this crap. I am starting to see a change, and it is starting to really wake many people I know up, but why the hell did it take so long? </p>
<p>If you can print out the website addresses for these News Forums and place them in public areas, on telephone polls, and Store Billboards, maybe the greater percentage of Americans will start to realize what has happened to their country over the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Nothing will happen until they are given the truth through objective reporting of the events.</p>

		<p>Even as pro-white as I am, if this was a decent, hardworking black person that was really getting harrassed for no reason by anyone (even whites), I&rsquo;d side with him.  However, it&rsquo;s incidents like these that will make whites not trust blacks when they make accusations of racism.  For one, they lie most of the time in an effort to get sympathy or money.  Even Booker T. Washington talked about blacks in his day like that, and he died almost 100 years ago!</p>

		<p>Worth mentioning:  O&rsquo;Fallon is a white flight Metro East (Illinois suburb of St. Louis) suburb, whites are fleeing Belleville and moving to O&rsquo;Fallon and other nearby newer suburbs because East St. Louis blacks have been invading Belleville for years.  As an aside, O&rsquo;Fallon, Missouri, is also a white flight St. Louis suburb, albeit in the other direction.  Both named in honor of the same man, an 1850s St. Louis society archon.</p>

<p>Of course the Usual Suspects will run with the angle that this hoax is somehow proof of the &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; that drove this poor, &#8220;confused&#8221; man to perpetrate this &#8220;harmless prank&#8221; and that the 28 year old Kidd, &#8220;a youth&#8221; is &#8220;the real victim&#8221; in this story.</p>

<p> So I will not put them down, since I don&rsquo;t see them out doing mob and robs, attacking and beating Whites or anyone else, using machetes to behead people, etc. etc. Quit believing all the lies you have heard through the media, etc. </p>

<p>Not only that, but the majority of crimes are black on white.  They are far more likely to attack a white person or any other group because of their race and/or make racial slurs while doing it; they are more likely to rape a white woman than a white man raping a nonwhite woman; they are more likely to rob, steal, carjack, assault or kill a white person than vice versa.  Again, if whites are so mean and spend day and night trying to &#8216;keep them down&rsquo; and have a &#8216;plan&rsquo; for them, why are they still here living much better off in a white-majority country?  I think many that hate whites know this, and they are either in denial or resent it.  That&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s really about.</p>

		<p> I live in St. Louis,the #1 violent crime capital of the United Socialist States of America(where 99 % of ALL murders are committed by,um,&#8221;a certain ethnicity&#8221;.)<br>
These fake hate crimes have become so transparent! Anyone pro-white person knows that the K needs to go the way of the dinosaur and that any attempt to utlilize the moniker is a ploy by blacks or their liberal nutcase white friends.<br>
A recent poster has said that &#8220;worse is better&#8221; and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.Today,I can go into any white gathering and nearly every person will agree with me FUNDAMENTALLY.Me,the so-called &#8220;white supremacist&#8221;.Funny,I&rsquo;ve never considered our people to be &#8220;better&#8221; than anyone else..I just love and identify with my folks like a black or Mexican identifies with his.<br>
Where you all see doom,I see optimism.We are circling our wagons.</p>
