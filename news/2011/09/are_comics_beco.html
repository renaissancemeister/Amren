<h1><a href="https://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/07/are-comics-becoming-more-diverse/">Are Comics Becoming More Diverse?</a></h1>
 

<p>CNN, September 7, 2011</p>

<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miles Morales, a half-black, half-Hispanic teenager, will be taking over the character of Spider-Man in the Marvel Ultimate universe, following the death of Peter Parker. He is set to make an even bigger splash in the September 14 issue.</p>
<p>In the same month that Miles is becoming the star of the &#8220;Ultimate&#8221; Spider-Man title, DC Comics is launching the ongoing series &#8220;Batwing,&#8221; which features the first black character to take on the mantle of the Bat (that is to say, the persona of Batman), in stores now.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we were kicking around ideas for the &#8216;New 52,&rsquo; this idea kind of leapt out at us,&#8221; said writer Judd Winick. &#8220;For one, just expanding the Batman family, and also having one who is an African, living and working in the continent of Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batwing is a member of &#8220;Batman, Inc.&#8221; a global extension of the Batman brand launched in the comics late last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Africa is kind of an untouched setting for the DCU, it&rsquo;s never been part of a monthly title, never like this,&#8221; said Winick. &#8220;We want to attack it in kind of a really honest way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aside from dealing with the many very real issues in modern Africa, Batwing will face his own supervillain, right from the start, said Winick.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;ll be going toe to toe with a subtly named villain, &#8216;Massacre&rsquo;-a very, very large guy wearing body armor and swinging two machetes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a superhero story but it will have a lot of realism. Africa is a beautiful, dangerous, tortured and inspiring place, and we want it to get it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Comic book writer Brian] Bendis said that the original thinking behind the 13-year-old character was to find a new, ethnically diverse Spider-Man who would represent New York City and all that it means.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But what about the comic book stores themselves? Kyle Puttkammer, owner of the Galactic Quest stores in Georgia, said that he increased his order for &#8220;Ultimate Comics Spider-Man&#8221; in response to the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve always had a lot of interest in characters like Bishop, Black Panther, and Static Shock. When Nick Fury was portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, it seemed like a natural update.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Batwing, Puttkammer said, &#8220;[He] seems to be a throw back to an earlier story. Specifically, &#8216;the Batman nobody knows&rsquo; from Batman #250. I think it&rsquo;s pretty cool that DC is keeping an eye towards their rich history, while turning an eye to the future.&#8221;</p>
