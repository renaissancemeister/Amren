<h1>Bachmann Claims Immigration Worked &#8216;Very Well&rsquo; Before 1960s Reforms, When Nonwhites Were Excluded</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicolas Mendoza, Washington Independent, September 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At the Florida tea party debate on Monday, GOP presidential candidate and Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann criticized policies allowing undocumented immigrants to receive in-state tuition for public universities by hearkening back to a previous era. From CNN&rsquo;s debate transcript:</p>
<blockquote>REP. MICHELE BACHMANN: &hellip; I think that the American way is not to give taxpayer subsidized benefits to people who have broken our laws or who are here in the United States illegally. That is not the American way. Because the immigration system in the United States worked very, very well up until the mid-1960s when liberal members of Congress changed the immigration laws.
<p>What works is to have people come into the United States with a little bit of money in their pocket legally with sponsors so that if anything happens to them, they don&rsquo;t fall back on the taxpayers to take care of them. And then they also have to agree to learn the speak the English language, learn American history and our constitution. That&rsquo;s the American way.<br>
</blockquote><br>
In her criticism of liberal immigration reform, Bachmann was presumably referring to the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, or Hart-Celler Act, which ended the de facto national origins quotas that had governed U.S. immigration policy since 1924. As ThinkProgress&rsquo; Ian Millhiser writes:</p>
<blockquote>In 1924, Congress passed a package of immigration laws  &mdash;  including the National Origins Act and the Asian Exclusion Act  &mdash;  establishing a quota system giving preferential treatment to European immigrants. Under these laws, the number of immigrants who could be admitted from a given country was capped at a percentage of the number of people from that nation who were living in the United States in 1890. Because Americans were overwhelming of European descent in 1890, the practical effect of these laws was an enormous thumb on the scale encouraging white immigration.</blockquote>

		<p>I agree, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Whatever we are becoming, as a country, is nowhere I want to go.<br>
Pitting one ethnicity against another, giving benefits for your skin color, hiring based on skin color&hellip;&hellip;  Some kind of &#8216;payback&rsquo; for centuries ago that I had no part in, is foolishness of the worst kind.  Nothing good will come from the kind of treachery ted kennedy etc signed into back in 1965.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think Michele Bachmann realized the profundity of the point she was making   &mdash;   I concluded that right after she said this.  Then I realized that even if she didn&rsquo;t, the kook left and the neo-cons will not only inform her how profound her statement was, but they&rsquo;ll never let her live it down.</p>
<p>Which is fine by me, her campaign is floundering, and this might be the jolt it takes to turn it around.</p>

		<p>Notice the scare tactics used in the headline of this article: &#8220;&hellip;When Nonwhites Were Excluded.&#8221; Bachman didn&rsquo;t specifically mention white or nonwhite. That&rsquo;s Mendoza&rsquo;s interpolation.  Nevertheless, she&rsquo;s exactly right.</p>
<p>Notice also the quote from the article, <i>the practical effect of these laws was an enormous thumb on the scale encouraging white immigration &hellip;</i> As opposed, I guess, to an enormous thumb on the scale encouraging nonwhite immigration like we have today. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this writer would never draft a  headline pointing out that the other candidates, especially Rick Perry, favor policies that would lead to white dispossession.</p>
<p>If Bachman is nominated, she gets my vote.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m having a hard time getting motivated for any candidate, since the parties really seem to appear as two heads on the same beast. Immigration has been my greatest concern, and the knowing cowards and their Pravda media say nothing of it. This is the first peripheral testing of the waters that I&rsquo;ve heard as of yet. I&rsquo;ll pay more attention to Bachmann. </p>

		<p>On strictly economic grounds the race-replacement enthusiasts are liars. When America was largely labor self-sifficient after WWW2 up through 1973-the year the real wage began to stagnate-America achieved great things, and the real wage for millions of Native Born White Americans had an upward trajectory. The race-replacement enthusiasts would have us believe that a severe labor scarcity would be a terrible thing..this is a bold face-lie. Labor scarcities have always been a wonderfull thing for Native Born White Americans&hellip;single most important factor in raising the real wage  and labor scarcities correspond precisely to those eras in American history when immigration was nearly completely shut off. The end of WWW2 to 1973,-an era of very low legal immigration and almost no white immigration-was called the Golden Age of economic growth by economists. You either support a high wage economy or a low wage economy. A labor scarcity always induces a significant upward pressure on the real wage. Republican and Democratic politicians always blather on as they read from their policy wonk sheets about the need for a high wage economy&hellip;Well..that&rsquo;s easy enough..shut all nonwhite immigration down to 0 and start the expulsion of all the post-1965 nonwhite fifth columns. But of course, Republican and Democratic politicians are sociopathic liars..the last thing in the world that they want is  a high wage economy&hellip; both Republican and Democratic Politicians exist for no other reason than to secure high-fertility post-1965 scab labor for their sociopathic corporate paymasters&hellip;what they want is a low-wage slave labor economy for millions of Native Born White Americans:the intent is to maximize the scale of economic terror that millions of Native Born White Americans experience on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The Republican-Democratic low wage labor policy is the reason..is the force behind the rapid race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority with post-1965 high fertility nonwhite scab labor&hellip;treason is the reason.</p>
<p>Of course, the preservation of the Native Born White American population as a racial majority requires a policy of 0 legal and illegal immigration&hellip;to the extent that this would induce a severe labor scarcity..it would be a great thing for 1)the real wage,2)economic growth,3)technoogical innovation and protection of America&rsquo;s ecosytems and thousands of endangered species.</p>
<p>Although the race-replacement issue is absolutely the fundamental issue&hellip;the race-replacement issue is deeply interconnected with the economic and ecological crisis in America circa 20011.</p>
<p>The passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act should be renamed the 1965 Native Born White American Destruction Act.</p>

		<p>Bachmann for president!! To my knowledge she&rsquo;s the only Republican candidate who&rsquo;s made any reference thus far to immigration act of 1965. And not just once, but twice! How about a quota system based on the 1960 census, when the country was still almost 90 precent white. Or even the 1980 census. Anything is better than what we have now. As a sidenote, I went to the local mall recently and felt like I was in a third world bazaar. Hoards of noisy mestizos, asians, Indians, Muslims in their head dresses, the demographic crisis we are facing is grave. Names like Ted Kennedy and Emanuel Cellar as nothing but curse words to me. </p>

		<p>Very Impressed she would say this. I still can&rsquo;t understand why many so called tea parties types prefer Rick Perry. I only know of Bachmann and Pat Buchanan who have run for president in past 20 years and have brought up the 65&rsquo; immigration changes.</p>

<p>Would that we still had sane leaders like we did in 1924.  Instead, our traitorous elites opted to turn America into a Third World hellhole, without a care in the world for what that would mean for their progeny.  I don&rsquo;t have the words to describe my loathing for the treasonous creatures who did this (and continue to do) to America.</p>

		<p>Bachmann&rsquo;s idea is over 25 million illegal aliens too late.  When they become citizens soon most will be going on Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare.  The parents will arrive too and go on Supplimental Social Security.</p>

		<p>This is a very courageous and truthful statement from a well<br>
known politician since the 1960&rsquo;s.<br>
since about 33% of the population is the result of the changes<br>
to the immigration laws since 1965 has change the country so<br>
much that it is not recognizable, and contributing to its<br>
economic and social demise, and so many freedoms that we<br>
took for granted are now lost, and the growth of the police<br>
state in which people now prefer security than freedom.<br>
I remember back in 1965 when the changes to the immigration<br>
laws were being debated in congress, the one result is that<br>
it would lead to an unstable future in which exactly has<br>
happened. </p>

		<p>I realize that this is utterly off the topic but I had a truly disturbing incident happen to me today and I&rsquo;m looking for a little advice. My best pal of 40+ years essentially ended our friendship this afternoon when I refused to recant my belief that individual blacks or hispanics or asians - or whites, for that matter -are NOT entitled to special privileges based purely on the color of their skin. I told him that I do NOT &#8220;hate blacks&#8221; but I DO hate a political/social system that accords them any  preferential treatment in education, hiring, immigration, etc. that they have not honestly earned. I would not employ a lazy, incompetent, violent white - why should I be compelled to honor an ersatz hiring &#8220;quota&#8221; of similar blacks? When he angrily accused me of being a racist, I just as angrily replied, &#8220;No, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m trying to be, but I&rsquo;m ashamed to say that I&rsquo;m not there yet. First I have to get 50 years of brainwashing out of my head, and this is a pretty tough thing to do. So I really can&rsquo;t claim that honor yet, but I thank you for the compliment, and I promise you I&rsquo;ll keep working on it till I get it right.&#8221; Perhaps I was wrong to egg on a childhood friend this way, but I have never criticized his left-wing beliefs (though he knows I don&rsquo;t share them); nor have I ever foisted my own beliefs on him or anybody else. But, apparently, this isn&rsquo;t enough. In the past 18 months, I have been involved in screaming matches (actually, they screamed; I sat in stony silence) with my brother, two nephews, and several co-workers because I would neither back down nor change my beliefs to suit their tastes. NOR abstain from voicing my honest opinion when it was actively solicited by them. I am hardly a &#8220;crackpot&#8221; a &#8220;lunatic rightist&#8221; a &#8220;tea party moron&#8221; (though I&rsquo;m a t.p. supporter) or a &#8220;fringe cultist.&#8221; But the more I am branded these, the more resolute I become in my beliefs. What I DIDN&rsquo;T realize was how MANY friends and acquaintances I would lose by quietly sticking to my guns. Is this phenomenon common among the readers of this forum? What have your own experiences been? Can I expect to sacrifice more family members and friends as time goes on? (Because I CANNOT lie or keep silent when cornered.) My head is spinning over this but it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve never really seen addressed here - the high price one pays for staying true to oneself and one&rsquo;s (unpopular) convictions. Am I alone in this?</p>

		<p>Backmann is right.  U. S. immigration policy DID work very well for Americans before 1965. California illustrates: </p>
<p>California: 1960 percent non-Hispanic white population: 92 </p>
<p>California 2010   &mdash;  - after the Immigration Act of 1965, the 1982 5-to-4 Plyler v. Doe decision ordering taxpayers to pay for the k-12 schooling of children brought to the U. S. illegally, the 1986  amnesty of 3 million illegal aliens, the nullification of California&rsquo;s Proposition 187 in 1995 by a single federal judge, the application of automatic birthright citizenship to hundreds of thousands of children of illegal aliens in California, etc   &mdash;  - is a very different story: </p>
<p>California: 2010 percent non-Hispanic white - 41</p>
<p>SOURCES: California: 1960 percent non-Hispanic white: 92 <br>
See 1960 Census data for California; scroll to Table 14:<br>

<p>[Calculation: White population  (14,455,230) divided by Total population (15,717,204) = 92 percent] </p>

		<p>Sadly, history will eventually look back on America changing its immigration laws in 1965 as the &#8220;beginning of the end&#8221; of white, Judeo-Christian hegemony in this country.  I believe the phrase &#8220;socio-cultural suicide&#8221; will appear in the same paragraph, if written by an honest observer.</p>

		<p> Bachmann is right, of course. This was a country that was as much as 89 percent Caucasian racially, and we should have kept it that way. But the 1964 Lyndon Landslide gave Democrats such a huge majority in both houses of Congress, that they got to commit more mischief, with long-term, disastrous consequences for America, than any Congress before or since.</p>
<p> Probably the crowning disgrace of that 1965-&#8216;66 Congress was its deliberate shifting of the immigration focus from Europe, to Asia, the Hispanic countries, and Africa. We&rsquo;ve never been the same since. We were most respected, admired, yes, and feared, in the world, when we were overwheminly White. There&rsquo;s an old saying, &#8220;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it.&#8221; Well, the Landslide Lyndon Congress fixed us, but good.</p>

		<p>Mexico gives preference to immigrants from Spain, and canada seems to think Immigrants that speak both English and French have an advantage. Neither bias is racist, they rightly assume that those that share the culture,language and ethnicity of the majority native born population are most likely have an easier time of assimilating.<br>
 WE used to have a similar rational approach to immigration.</p>

		<p>Amen to Ms. Bachman&rsquo;s conclusion regarding the efficacy of immigration before the Cellar-Hart bill that has forever damaged the US, contrary to the assurances of one traitor Ted Kennedy.  </p>
<p>Jared Taylor has recently published &#8216;White Identity&rsquo;, spending several hundred pages demonstrating that it is natural, moral and fully justified for a people (even a majority white one) to control immigration in a way that the character and, yes, the demographics of that nation is maintained in perpetuity.  Celler-Hart is destroying the character of our beloved nation and should be repealed in its entirety as soon as possible!<br>

		<p>I know the opinions are split regarding voting (as in, &#8220;is it a waste of time for whites to vote?&#8221;) but I think sending Ms Bachmann an email thanking her for standing against more taxpayer funded immigration is a good idea. If we express our support, hopefully she won&rsquo;t back down on immigration.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m pretty sure that &#8220;refugees&#8221; are a totally separate issue than immigration. Regardless of who is in office  the US will continue to go on &#8220;peace keeping&#8221; missions and take sides in conflicts that have nothing to do with us, then resettle the poor helpless non white refugees at taxpayer (ie, my paycheck) expense.</p>

<p>I feel your pain, every day. My girlfriend is a total Liberal. I have a sister who is simply deluded. Most of my friends, being artists, are left- leaning, or can&rsquo;t fully come out and admit or acknowledge the truth on race. They just CAN&rsquo;T. To them, it means excommunication, being shunned. </p>
<p>The &#8220;conservatives &#8221; I Know are closer to the truth, but still won&rsquo;t speak frankly, except in VERY controlled environments. Money, you know!</p>
<p>Every day I see my town go third world more and more&hellip; every single day, more invasion, more strife, and crime, hideous crowding. </p>
<p>The jobs are disappearing, yet more Mestizos pile in every day. Blacks too. Why are they here? How are they here? What happened to my city, my state, my country?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what is holding this country together. It is surreal, and I feel it is about to explode, or collapse&hellip;but still, the truth is unacceptable. Must not  talk&hellip;</p>
<p>I am despondent,and trying to have a &#8220;who cares&#8221; attitude, while keeping my eyes open, and my head on straight. I will not give up, but CARING what people do&hellip;it seems a fool&rsquo;s errand. Either they are third world society killers, or marxist white haters, or people passing the buck, hoping to keep their lifestyle one more year. </p>
<p>How can I care what they do or think, since to care, is to be enraged and depressed?</p>
<p>No one I know is amenable to reason. It&rsquo;s all feel- good delusion they want. Only the old (and non Marxist old, at that) have any sense in the matter, and they can somewhat be honest, for they are leaving this earth. </p>
<p>(By the way, at this moment, I can see NO WAY that Obama will get re-elected.  He will be shelacked, being blamed for the economy, of course. That at least is cause for some hope, but we have a hell of a job to do, keeping  the Republicans&rsquo; feet to the fire! Oh, and I truly believe that blacks and mestizos will start a real race war at election time. I never felt that way for sure, but this gut feeling is there now).</p>
<p>I need to rise above this dilemma, so I can survive, but I was raised to BELIEVE in my people, country, my future. Time to look inside for something more substantial, is all I can say&hellip; I do not want to be so angry! I do not even want to be so cynical. But I&rsquo;m not one for religious- type conversions. I loathe the concept of being born again into some great faith, or belief&hellip;people always pull that stuff in their desperation. I am too rational&hellip;which increases the misery. Truth HURTS. I need to accept it, and still move on with a smile. But that means unabashedly SPEAKING it&hellip;which means losing a LOT of friends.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

		<p>Bachmann may say immigration policies are too liberal, but would she restrict them if president?  I don&rsquo;t see her eliminating immigration from Latin America, Haiti, Africa, India, the MidEast, Asia, etc.  &mdash;  let alone pushing for pure European immigration.

		<p>Paul #23: I want to take a more cautious approach to Michele Bachmann. One remark does not make a Candidate.</p>
<p>Even though she does have the Academic and Professional credentials for the job of President, unlike the current White House occupant, I still believe that most of these Candidates will say whatever is useful, and necessary, for our votes. I am tired of that tred mill. </p>
<p>Many Amreners have discussed at legnth, people like Rick Perry, and Mitt Romney, along with Gingrich. Even Ron Paul has been the subject of debate, here.</p>
<p>But unlike Perry, Romney, and Gingrich, Ron Paul has a consistantly stable record for voting by and for our Constitution, and the restraints that it puts on Government, not the people.</p>
<p>Further, all other Candidates have big money behind them, and many belong to the Council on Foreign Relations, which is pushing all the global agendas. </p>
<p>So, if you are tired of the &#8220;Peace keeping&#8221; and &#8220;Nation building&#8221; exercises that our Military is engaged in, the only Candidate who has spoken out against these things, time after time, is Ron Paul. </p>
<p>Mr. White #21: That&rsquo;s a good question. I just thought of an idea, to hold a Presidential Debate sponsored by American Renaissance, where Jared Taylor could be the Mediator. </p>
<p>That would be a lively Debate, and one worth watching.   </p>

                         You have my sympathy.One of the sickest, most horrible spectacles of modern times, something that never ceases to amaze and appall me is the way that fellow Whites - sometimes even family members and close realtions, as you state, are willing to argue and hate one another, with hatred taken to the extreme over&hellip;&hellip;non-White populations, most of whom happen to be antagonistic to Whites, and would kill you as soon as look at you.<br>
  Lefties will beat, kick, howl, shout, scream, pull hair out to demonstrate their &#8216;moral superiority.No spectacle is more disheartening, more fundamentally unintelligent and unpleasant than seeing some pompous, self-aggrandizing, &#8216;moralizing&rsquo; White get on his moral high horse and argue to the point of tears and hatred in defense of those who are his Darwinian rivals and replacers.Gosh, how I despise their stagey pomposityand their desire to be seen as &#8216;brave&rsquo;, &#8216;moral&rsquo; good guys fighting a batle, little pocket Atticus Finches - it&rsquo;s their moral pomposity and stage effected acting out that they are the &#8216;good guys&rsquo; that really gets me.</p>

		<p>I went to the mall recently and felt like I was in a third world bazaar&hellip;&#8221; -Anonymous<br>
Exactly!! The mall used to be where I`d go to look at girls and anything else worthwhile. Now I don`t. But before I stopped I did a little research.  I sat for two hours and did a pen and paper  head count on customers by ethnicity. Whites were somewhere between 6% and 8% of customers. This at the premier and still flagship mall in my city. The other alarming thing was  OF THAT 8%, folks over 65 were probably 60%&hellip;<br>
A mall that as recently as the mid eighties was still 85% White. The stores also reflect those changes. It`s gone from upscale Men`s wear, to stores selling wedding dresses for a mostly low income Hispanic clientle. <br>
  So I complained about it to my best friend of 40 years who tolerates with disapproval me noticing things like that. Then he drove me to another mall in a city 85 miles away. It was like Land of the Lost. We hit it on Tuesday morning and there was nothing but White Soroity girls in the late teens and housewives in their mid thirties. Some even pusing baby carriages.  I couldn`t gt enough!! It made me think that someone could open a private mall where guys like me could walk thru and remember growing up at the mall. Think amusement park for Whites&hellip; It was soo good I arranged for the same friend to drive me their on Saturday morning and I`d get us both jazzed up at lunch and a hotel room. When we got there on Saturday morning, the customer base was 95% low income Hispanic&hellip;Damn! I think there is some kind of division of resources or tacit agreement on which groups have what days. It reminded me of Fisherman`s wharf in San Francisco. Go at seven in the morning and  it`s ALL White folks jogging and dog walking. Go back at 3:00pm and it looks like a gangbanger baby sitting service&hellip;</p>

It wasn`t his ideaology that turned me off, it was his refusal to tolerate mine. Now I think we`d have been better off letting it die by one of us taking up golf. In closing I would like to tell you an article I read on letting friendships die. Sometimes it happens, because it needs to. I think this was in Men`s Life or health. In the authors case his friend was still stuck in the early twenties alcohol blur of acting out in a self destructive way. <br>

I used to be a liberal who had to battle the opinions of almost everyone around me.  About 12 years ago, I read Race, Evolution, and Behavior by J. Philippe Rushton, and my whole worldview on race changed.  I at first didn&rsquo;t want to believe what I was reading, but I realized that numbers such as IQ averages don&rsquo;t lie.  My present husband, a liberal, was upset with my new opinions, but gradually grew to at least tolerate them.  I believe he sometimes agrees with me, but won&rsquo;t admit it.  My advice is to present your opponents with the numerial facts about IQ and crime.  After a while, they&rsquo;ll probably run out of steam.</p>

<p>Ask your lefty friends and family the following questions:1)would they like to see an America with over a billion people..if not, how would they stablize the current exponential population growh in the US..2)ask them the following:since they are in favor of a rapidly growing US population, would they also like to see Native Born White Americans having large families again like they did in the past..of course they are going to answer no to this question..this,of course, reveals their very hostile intent towards the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;accuse them of hating their fellow Native Born White Americans&hellip;ask them why they don&rsquo;t think Native Born White Americans should have large families again&hellip;.then 3)ask them the following question 3) why would you deprive your fellow Native Born White Americans the great benefits of a severe labor scarcity-which would happen if post-1965 nonwhite immigration were shut down to 0. Shutting post-1965 legal immigration down to 0-because it would  induce a severe labor scarcity-would drive up the real wage and create much more economically equitable society&hellip;Native Born White American labor would have much more power than it has now over the bossman.Ask them 4)why should millions of Native Born White Americans be in favor of an immigration policy that would reduce them to a rapidly dwindling racial minority within the borders of America surrounded by a very large hostile,heavily armed high fertility post-1965 nonwhite majority.</p>
<p>The point is to expose your lefty family&rsquo;s and lefty friends hatred towards the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;make this the focus of the debate..never veer from it..which a discussion of IQ tests scores surely will. Now your family and friend will blather on about the &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; and nonesense about where did your ancestors come from&hellip;respond back that &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;-Ameridans-were engaging in large scale violent conquests and genocides on the North and South American Continents for centuries..and there is very interesting archaeological evidence that Europeans may have been the orignal Native Peoples in North American  but were exterminated before they could get a foothold  by the violent Ameridians. And..tell them that no one takes the Golden Rule seriously when it comes to the  immigrant ancestors sob story:if and when the Asians,Muslims,Hispanics and Africans become a racial majority within the borders of America, the will experience no racial guilt about being a racial majority..it will be a harcore-racial National Origins Immigration Policy all year round.</p>
<p>Your lefty family and friend are the racists&hellip;tell them if they like living among nonwhites, then  why aren&rsquo;t they living in Newark NJ which has been blessed many times over by post-1965 nonwhite diversity. </p>

<p>Seems that you have realized who the enemy is: <i>fellow brainwashed whites.</i></p>
<p>I recognized this a very long time ago, but it was really driven home when I caught a glimpse of old Ted Kennedy&rsquo;s funeral parade in Washington DC.  </p>
<p>I noticed that the streets were lined almost exclusively with white people.  They came out and stood for hours to honor a disgusting old fool who did so much, along with LBJ, to destroy the white majority and reduce us to third world status. </p>
<p>Missing from the crowds were any noticeable presence of blacks or other minorities that old Ted falsely claimed to love so much. The few I did see were likely security goons of some type or other.</p>
<p>Occasionally friends and acquaintances will comment to me that &#8220;there&rsquo;s gonna be another civil war in this country and it will be a race war&#8221;.  Of course my response is that there already is a race war, but whites haven&rsquo;t acknowledged it yet.  </p>
<p>I go on to say if a real serious shooting war ever breaks out, it&rsquo;ll be between whites.  It will fall along the lines of the argument that commenter #14  &mdash;  Baltimore Business Owner related. </p>
<p>But there will be no final armed resistance among whites to the end of their presence in large numbers in North America. We will go willingly to or doom. Oh yes, there will be a whimper here and there but that will be about it.</p>

<p>Bachmann was presumably referring to the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, or Hart-Celler Act, which ended the de facto national origins quotas that had governed U.S. immigration policy since 1924. As ThinkProgress&rsquo; Ian Millhiser writes:</p>
<p>In 1924, Congress passed a package of immigration laws &mdash; including the National Origins Act and the Asian Exclusion Act &mdash; establishing a quota system giving preferential treatment to European immigrants. Under these laws, the number of immigrants who could be admitted from a given country was capped at a percentage of the number of people from that nation who were living in the United States in 1890. Because Americans were overwhelming of European descent in 1890, the practical effect of these laws was an enormous thumb on the scale encouraging white immigration.</p>
<p>______________________</p>
<p>The writer of this article, Mr. Mendoza, does not acknowledge or seem to know that Latin America was somewhat different.  As I vaguely remember from that era, the citizens of our Western Hemisphere neighbors were exampted from that restriction and were treated separately from the rest of the world. </p>

<p>I think we have all had similar experiences with family and friends. Hang in there. For some odd reason it seems that opinions on RACE is the one big taboo in America today. If you are White and see the TRUTHS about race, then you are automatically the &#8220;black&#8221; sheep. I have come to accept being labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221; and a hater from those that insist on being PC and delusional when it comes to nonwhites, but they will never admit THEY are wrong and we are right. Whites used to be racially aware, but no longer, due to the massive, deliberate brainwashing  and the flooding of America with nonwhites. </p>
<p>Just be secure in the fact that you are correct to feel as you do and if you lose friends, and family because of it, so be it. They were never your friends to begin with and if they can never see the truth before their own eyes, then there is nothing you can do to awaken them. Just continue reading Amren and the like, and KNOW that you are not alone and that millions feel the same as you do.  WE will be your friends.</p>

<p>Well, my advice to you is to &#8220;stick to your guns&#8221; even if it costs losig so-called friends or even family members when voicing your opinions about affirmative action and other racial set-asides that have been pushed down our collective throats by the government, Democrats and Repbulicans, and the media.  I&rsquo;m not nor have never been a business owner but have worked in a local government job for years and saw first hand how Whites were pushed out of good paying jobs solely based upon their race.  About 72% of the top paying jobs in the Chicago Dept. of Health are held by Black women.  The rest are held by Black or Hispanics.  When I talk to retired friends who are all Liberals(it seems) they say that it is all right with them.  If you walk thru the City Hall in Chicago or the County Building, you could count the number of White employees on one hand.  Most of the citizens here seem to enjoy being second-class citizens and don&rsquo;t mind it at all if their own college educated sons and daughters end up working at downtown coffe shops or fast food outlets.  Senator Edward &#8220;Ted&#8221; Kennedy was the driving force behind the Hart-Cellar Act that he helped push thru the Congress and which changed the demographics of this country.  It is a disgrace that he is buried in Arlington National Cemetary today.</p>

		<p>If anyone has any doubts about Steve Sailer&rsquo;s asianphilia just go check out his post today on vdare.com about what he see as the policy implications of standardized test high scoring Asians in our America. Sailer writes that White Americans have a lot to learn from Asians in America..so the fact that Asian legal immigrants stole the jobs and wages of thousands of Native Born White American Men during  the 1970&rsquo;s,1980s,1990s and the new century was no big deal after all..because without the Asians in our America, Native Born White Americans would never learn how to do science and math and at a very high and elite level..it must have been a miracle that a 90 percent Native Born White America- and a NASA that was 99 percent White-was able to put 12 Alpha White Males on the moon&hellip;I mean its really disgusting isn&rsquo;t it?&hellip;And some people wonder why I go ballistic over the IQ test score stuff..go read Sailer&rsquo;s post today on vdare.com&hellip; I&rsquo;m being very fair to the spirit of Sailer&rsquo;s post today on vdare.com.</p>
<p>From 1945-1973 America was a relative paradise for the majority Native Born White American population..since the passage of the White American destroying 1965 Immigration Reform Act, life in &#8220;America&#8221; has been become an exponentially growing dystopia in the spirit of Bladerunner.</p>

Back in &#8216;94 I told my oldest and dearest friend that, though I harboured not the slightest ill will towards anyone, I could not accept that there was any such thing as a black Englishman. This was just after political correctness had gained a foothold. A few days later he wrote me a letter calling me a dinosaur. Our friendship was over.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what it usually amounts to:  Polishing their own halo.<br>
They love to feel good about themselves. Their self-image is extremely important to them. They want to be seen (and think of themselves) as good, kind, virtuous people full of love and tolerance for all humanity.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t see that this is the path to self-suicide. Just keep giving and giving, while others keep taking and taking. Support anyone else but your own.<br>
 <br>
The often hysterical response you receive, and their pompous assumption of the moral high ground, coupled with their total refusal to look at facts,  only serve to prove that  <i>this is a sort of RELIGION</i> that you are confronting.  It is based on BELIEF, not on REASON. Reason and facts won&rsquo;t make a dent on them.</p>

		<p>Baltimore Business Owner. I also &#8220;echo&#8221; your feelings. While I have not lost a friendship over my beliefs, I am constantly being scorned by my Wife to tone it down. And by my Dad, and to a certain extent, my co-workers. The strange thing is my Mom shares my beliefs and will let it be known almost too confrontationally. I bring it up all the time when watching the local news. Almost every story points to a black assailant. Usually the victim is black, but alot of times White. </p>
<p>I get tired of seeing the same thing, and so I usually live by the mantra that if you don&rsquo;t have anything good to say about a situation, then don&rsquo;t say anything. In front of my wife &amp; daughter I usually don&rsquo;t comment. But it&rsquo;s hard biting my tongue. I grew up in a city that is 68% black. But I thank God that my parents sent my older sister and me to private schools that were 90% White. If I would have gone to those schools where some of my neighborhood friends went to, I would have gotten into a lot of trouble, or beaten by blacks &Puerto; Ricans, harrassed, or joined up with said groups to avoid all of that stuff. </p>
<p>Now I ended doing alot of crazy things in my youth, but I am grateful that I had the upbringing that I had. And that my wife and I will raise our daughter to be aware of the dangers of &#8220;wannabe&#8221; White kids &amp; their dark idols. Alot of it boils down to the kids who go to school to learn and the ones who go to turn the school upside down.</p>

		<p>I just found out something about section 8.  Many small towns and cities reserve section 8 housing not for people already living in the city, BUT FOR LOW INCOME MINORITIES WHO WORK IN THE CITY.  </p>
<p>This translates as the illegal aliens who work in the restaurants, hotels, hospitals, movie theaters, fast food and other employers of illegals.</p>
<p>So the employers of these illegals don&rsquo;t have to worrry about their illegals being late for work or quitting for a job nearer home.</p>
<p>Problem is, the illegals thug children go to the public schools and destroy them.</p>
<p>Santa Monica Ca is a perfect example of this.  The town is an entertainment and dining out center for the area.  The public schools have been destroyed by the spawn of the illegals who work in the restaurants and hotels and live in city provided section 8.  Most of the crime in the city is committed the section 8 illegals and their children.</p>

As I understand it the National Origins Act never discriminated against Hispanics although it put restrictions on the number of migrants from eastern and southern Europe. </p>

                        I really cannot say where this behavior originated.All I can compare it to is the fanaticism that certain religious people &#8216;defend&rsquo; the precepts of their religion and are aggressive (not merely intolerant) against any dissent.<br>
  Communists usually show the same trait.<br>
The acting out and making a self-righteous &#8216;martyr&rsquo; of oneself might be rooted in some long-forgotten religiousity - but more likely Freudian attention seeking and &#8216;dominance&rsquo; behavior.You see in a controlled environment such as this, normal rules of civility are jettisoned when &#8216;dealing with a racist&rsquo;, and the real nasty little bully can show his true face and score some &#8216;dominance&rsquo; points.</p>

<p>As you can see, you have many compatriots in regards to losing friends and family over what are today, minority and courageous opinions and commitments.  Too bad we are so spread out, we could get one of the liberal style &#8220;support groups&#8221; going!  But we need to support one another.  Being a highly incisive intellect, I managed to fall out with first my wacko conservative parents, and then my wacko liberal sisters and remaining family over their liberal biases.  I have lost the few old friends I have over their liberal biases.  Except for my wife, I am pretty much isolated.  I have learned that first of all, NO ONE is going to share ALL your opinions nor understand, or care about all your ideas.  Most friendships only last as long as they live in a somewhat superficial zone.  Words, our only way of communicating, are often not enough, which is why emails and posts upset so many people.  But this is also why I always call for tolerance among those of use who are regular Amren posters.  Even Jared Taylor is a human being and his intentions sometimes are not conveyed perfectly either. He suffers from political and social pressure too. (I am taking the liberty of guessing that).</p>
<p>A conference that can&rsquo;t find a conference friendly location needs something more.  We need our own permanent compound.  Yes, it would get picketed and likely attacked, both politically and physically, but what better to raise our issues?  One problem we have always had a a nation of families is the size of this country.  I have relations, some of whom I have never met, spread out throughout this nation from coast to coast.  With the increased costs of travel, connecting becomes even more difficult.  But I do think that some permanent friendships might be forged between some members of this Amren community if there was a national headquarters with at least enough room to host a large gathering, and have some recreation available, even if was just horseshoes (an old American game!).  Of course, the danger of that is the forming of cliques of certain groups and others, like the super-die hard Christians against the non-believing, but none-the-less white race realists, etc.  That is what I mean about &#8220;tolerating&#8221; ourselves.  One small minority of posters in agreement is of Jews, like jewamongyou and Jewish and Proud.  Will the entire Amren community tolerate them, or do we go on repeating the self-defeating attitudes which are based on ignorance?  Are we able to use all our high IQ to reinvent a more refined white identity, rid of our own foot-shooting habits?  Time will tell. </p>

Their labels (Nazi, racist, fascist, etc&hellip;) mean NOTHING! Their arguments are weak, so they resort to name calling. Sadly, that tactic has worked because we are civil and try to find common ground. Maybe it&rsquo;s time to turn their tactics on them, give them a taste of their own medicine?  </p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. </p>
<p>THERE is &ldquo;The Help,&rdquo; and then there is the help. And she is not happy.  Ablene Cooper, a 60-year-old woman who has long worked as a maid here, has filed a lawsuit against Kathryn Stockett, the author of the best-selling novel &ldquo;The Help,&rdquo; about black maids working for white families in Jackson in the 1960s. </p>
<p>In the complaint, Ms. Cooper argues that one of the book&rsquo;s principal characters, Aibileen Clark, is an unpermitted appropriation of her name and image, which she finds emotionally distressing. </p>
<p><br>
&ldquo;What she did, they said it was wrong,&rdquo; Ms. Cooper said of the  </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Hinds County Circuit Court, contends that Kathryn Stockett was &ldquo;asked not to use the name and likeness of Ablene&rdquo; before the book was published, though it does not specify who asked. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was dismissed as without merit on August 16, 2011.<br>
Yu can be sure however that althugh Ms Race Traitor Stockett did not have to pay damages to Ms. Cooper, she paid enormous legal fees to defend herself.<br>

<p>Like the other posters, I support and sympathize with your views. I own my own business and have lived in the LA area for several years. I used to be a moderate and had many liberal friends. I would usually curb my tongue and not talk about politics. Some knew my views and usually respected them. Some liberals went out of their way to shove their ideas down my throat and viciously attack me if I disagreed. I would always try to remain civil and defend my position with facts and statistics. This would result in their shouting me down, calling me a &#8220;nazi&#8221;, (that is their favorite one), and even sticking their fingers in their ears and yelling &#8220;LA, LA, LA, LA!&#8221;. These were not children, but middle aged professionals. One was even a minor celebrity. We all hate each other so much now, we cannot even say hello to each other. I find them disgusting. I no longer bother with these screwballs. I&rsquo;m sure they say worse about me.  The left wing wierdos I&rsquo;ve met at church are just as bad.  No Christian church will invite you to their mixers if they find out you are a conservative realist, even moderate. I actually have more minority acquaintances than white liberals.  These people hate you, and they never were your friends. Good riddance to them, and good luck.</p>

		<p>A year or two ago I was in a meeting with a friend of mine and a black man. As we were chatting informally, the black man suggested we each of us write a list of the five greatest actors who ever lived. It seemed an odd suggestion but we proceeded. I wrote down &#8216;Anthony Hopkins, Brando, De Niro, Olivier, Ralph Richardson.&rsquo; My friend, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, went for Pacino, John Gielgud, Dustin Hoffman, Alec Guinness, Spencer Tracy. We read out our lists then the black man read his. He delivered his names with a solemn tone, like he was reciting a list of the fallen: Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Laurence Fishburne&hellip; With each name my friend and I sank lower into our chairs, like two racists, named and shamed&hellip; Samuel L Jackson, Sidney Poitier. Our humiliation was complete. Our moral superior looked down upon us from his pedestal, placed there by the self-hating white man.  </p>

<p>I agree. At least consciously she doesn&rsquo;t. But no matter, more and more of the truth keeps slipping out and as long as we who are conscious use everything these pols say and put the message out it will seep into the awareness of more and more white people. </p>
<p>Baltimore Business Owner:</p>
<p>&#8220;But the more I am branded these, the more resolute I become in my beliefs. What I DIDN&rsquo;T realize was how MANY friends and acquaintances I would lose by quietly sticking to my guns. Is this phenomenon common among the readers of this forum? What have your own experiences been? Can I expect to sacrifice more family members and friends as time goes on?&#8221;</p>
<p>You are not alone and your experience lines up with what millions of us have gone through. I never had it out with family, since most of them agree with me or didn&rsquo;t contradict (except for one cousin who&rsquo;s fried too many brain cells). But I lost several friends. One old childhood friend, when I tried to tell her what was going on downstate in the city (hence my moniker) called me a racist and acted like she was disappointed in me. This one hurt badly and got me very angry, as did another one of my friends, who when I told him that on 9/11 the muslims in my neighborhood were celebrating (while I thought a friend of mine was dead. Thankfully not), told me sneeringly that I was &#8220;entitled to my own opinion&#8221;. I nearly hit him. </p>
<p>The consequences of this massive 1965 crime reach deep, right down to the bottom of who we are, so it both pains me and heartens me to hear of your experience. The great hope I have is that I know that White people are capable of miracles once our resolve is awakened, and the more of us who look at our experience and refuse to be cowed by some twisted marxist code about what we should talk about, while not ensuring victory will at least bloody up the other side real good. Michelle Bachmann may not fully grasp it but she has spoken what so many of us know deep down is true. Next year should be very interesting. Gird your loins.</p>

<p>     I have a slightly different problem.  Frequently when I bring up something about the race replacement of the country my friends tell me that &#8216;we are old so what do we care&rsquo;.  I tell them that &#8216;you have children and grandchildren - don&rsquo;t you care about their future&rsquo;.  Suppose Washington and Jefferson thought like you, what kind of life would we have had in this country&rsquo;.  This sometimes makes them reflect on their attitude.

		<p>I found Baltimore Business Owner&rsquo;s story a little surprising. I don&rsquo;t doubt the truth of what he said, but its quite different from my own experience here in England. My friends all know my views and are pretty relaxed about them, probably because they all share them to some extent! I very much doubt if I would ever have become friends with someone who is a dyed-in-the-wool liberal because the necessary empathy is just not there.</p>
<p>I was one of those outed as a member of the BNP a few years ago and my work mates, including several from ethnic minorities, were also pretty relaxed about it. Within my own family, my wife and children are, annoyingly, far more liberal than I am but tend to regard my views as a sort of lovable quirk (sad, but a lot better than the sort of hostility described in some of these posts).Perhaps I&rsquo;ve just been very lucky.</p>
<p>The only advice I can give to Baltimore is to find new friends. There must be local chapters of racially aware organisations somewhere in the Baltimore area. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Actually, O Anonymous, there are Quebecois in positions of real power in Canada whose hatred of Anglophone Canada and its values is such that they would - and do - gladly admit any Malian, Haitian, Lebanese or Sengalese with ten words of spoken French in preference to a mere Anglophone of any color.</p>
<p>Ask any truthful Canadian for the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Odd, since the Canadian immigration policy was crafted specifically to dilute the Quebecois voting power. Remember when (a few years back) you almost gained independence for Quebec? Try it today, and you will have No chance whatsoever, because government dependant foreign voters now outnumber the Quebecois; and they have no desire to stop suckling the socialist government teat of handouts and privilege they have been gifted with. Immigration policies in every Western nation are the same; genocide against the native population in favor of the third world.</p>
<p>You have to know that our political hierarchy looks at Brasil as the model for the future; impoverished masses with a mean IQ hovering in the 80&rsquo;s, unable to think cognitively enough to fight back against the &#8216;ruling class&rsquo; who live in fortified communities patrolled by well armed &#8216;police&rsquo;. If you cannot impose a third world dictatorship over your population; replace them with one you can.</p>
<p>Alot of people state &#8216;you cannot have a first world country with a third world population&rsquo; -which is correct so far as it goes; but the real point is &#8216;you cannot have a Third World country with a First World Population&rsquo; -which is the reason for current genocidal immigration policies throughout Europe and North America. These policies are even directly against the UN&rsquo;s own treaties against genocide -which just goes to show&hellip;<br>

<p>I had a very unpleasant exchange with a good, long time friend of mine recently.  He&rsquo;s moved so that his child can go to a decent school that isn&rsquo;t overwhelmed with third world children.  I made a wee comment on the fact that no one likes Pakistani muslims and he went ballistic.  We almost came to blows over it.  I thought he was a pathetic disgrace and hypocrite.  My mother is a pretty liberal type person but has definitely changed her tune over the past decade.  She can&rsquo;t stand muslims and is leary of blacks to.  Stick to your guns and all the best.</p>

		<p>I guess I have been racially aware too long. I have seen the truth since I was 17 I am now 53. Even my brother who used to be very liberal says I am right. I just do not see how a person with an average intelligence above an Ape cannot see White societies are in a league by themselves. Asians for all this talk of IQ have invented next to nothing. Look at Jews they started out as a Middle Eastern people and to survive and compete in White societies they  had to achieve almost superhuman IQ&rsquo;s and become practically White.<br>
White societies are Nature&rsquo;s gift to the world. Period. What has transpired since 1965 is nothing short of insanity.</p>

<p>Liberals like your former friend cling to the big fantasy that all ethnic groups and races are exactly the same.  Why?  </p>
<p>Their belief about people is a Marxist religion to them.  They have been brainwashed and indoctrinated, probably when they were tiny children.  For you to disagree is to insult their whole value system and they will respond with rage.</p>
<p>Second, many liberals have a bit of the anarchist in them.  They want to destroy white society and remake it into something totally different because they really don&rsquo;t like their own people.</p>
<p>Third, many liberals marry/date/adopt non-whites or have close family members who have done so, and by being apologists for non-whites they are validating their own life choices or their family&rsquo;s choices. </p>
<p>Fourth, being outraged at racially aware whites who won&rsquo;t play their Marxist fantasy game gives the liberals the exciting rush of feeling morally superior to the only group they really fear as competitors for status, other whites. </p>

<p>Hey who is WE, as in this?  &#8220;Also, WE do not think that &ldquo;they are superior to Whites.&rdquo; WE believe on the available evidence that they have higher average IQs, and lower crime rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>So you admit YOU are an Asian?  What is that, John?</p>

I&rsquo;m sure it was a wise thing for you to not to try to take,(not that you had an intention to do this at the time) anything out of the black woman&rsquo;s shopping bag at the time, because the other blacks on the bus, I&rsquo;m assuming all of them were black the way you described the situation, would&rsquo;ve been outraged that a white was stealing from a &#8220;sister&#8221;, and then would&rsquo;ve been all over you like white on rice. </p>

		<p>Baltimore Business Owner: You hit a nerve. Just the same, your questionable &#8220;Friendships&#8221; have died, so it&rsquo;s time to bury them and get on with your life.</p>
<p>People like that were never your frineds to begin with, because unlike their pet blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, and others, they won&rsquo;t let you be who you are. That&rsquo;s damned Intolerant of these Tolerant types.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. Liberals, Communists, Socialists, and other Left Wing fruit loops yell and scream about tolerance, except when you have a different opinion from their&rsquo;s.  </p>
<p>They love Free Speech, unless you&rsquo;re giving them a healthy dose of truth, which they recoil from, like a Vampire from a Crucifix. </p>
<p>Remember, these people you mentioned have been brainwashed by those Marxist Nerd &#8220;Teachers&#8221; and &#8220;Professors&#8221; all their lives. </p>
<p>These are the same &#8220;Teachers&#8221; who, when they were growing up were the gorky kids with bad skin, greasy hair, bad breath, wearing clothes they looked like they slept in, all while being marginalized from any real friendships with other Classmates, most often than not, real people of substance, who wore clean clothes, washed their hair, played Sports in School, lead the Cheerleading Squad, went out on dates, and had other friends to hang out with. </p>
<p>In short, these extreme Misfits grew up angry at a White Society they never could fit into, so they decided to destroy it, by taking up the struggle of the other marginalized and &#8220;Opressed types&#8221; and began their journey into Socialism and Communism. </p>
<p>These School Nerds, who never fit in, are the ones Teaching our kids, and that is a really bad thing for all of us, as the past 50 years have shown. You just lived through it.  </p>
<p>So, ask these &#8220;open minded types&#8221; to watch a few video Documentaries, which are well done, and explain things in detail. </p>
<p>If they refuse, you can tell them exactly what you think of them again, because they refuse to give anything with documented and Scientific proof, the time of day.</p>
<p>These videos include: &#8220;The Third Jihad&#8221; which shows the Muslim desire to dominate the entire planet. Ask your tolerant MTV type friends, cousins, nieces, and nephews if the Muslims will let them dress the way they do, and have sex before marriage, drink beer and other alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and other &#8220;funny cigarettes&#8221;, wear their crystals, and other &#8220;New Age&#8221; nonsense, which flies in the face of the Prophet, etc., etc. etc.? </p>
<p>We know that most of these offenses are punishable in the extreme, in Muslim countries. Do these Liberals and Communists think they will be immune from the punishments? </p>
<p>Then watch, &#8220;Ice Age Columbus&#8221; which is a Scientific Documentary that details the facts that prove that White Europeans were here in the Americas several thousand years before others arrived. </p>
<p>The third video would be &#8220;Ukranian Homodor&#8221; which details the Soviet murder of the Ukrainian farmers, in the 1930s. Most of these snot nosed Liberals and Communists still think that that Monster, Stalin, is some type of &#8220;Socialist Saint&#8221;. Now there&rsquo;s a contradiction in terms. </p>
<p>I would even throw in the video of what happened in the Polish &#8220;Katyean Forrest&#8221;. Polish Officers were murdered by the Soviet Red Army, but the official story, after World War II, through the end of the Cold War, was that they were murdered by the Germans. Another lie has been shattered, and the Polish people know the truth. </p>
<p>Finally, have them watch the video, &#8220;Beast as Saint&#8221;. If they haven&rsquo;t had a stroke by now, they just might come around to your side. </p>

		<p>Engleman, since you believe that average IQ rules everything, you must therefore agree that the Poles, Germans and Dutch with IQs estimated at averages ranging from 109 to 106 are superior to Chinese, Koreans and Japanese?</p>
<p>If you believe that asians have a low crime rate you must still believe in Santa Claus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have to know that our political hierarchy looks at Brasil as the model for the future; impoverished masses with a mean IQ hovering in the 80&rsquo;s, unable to think cognitively enough to fight back against the �?ruling class&rsquo; who live in fortified communities patrolled by well armed �?police&rsquo;. &rdquo; <br>

<p>I have often heard this tired mantra, over and over, &hellip; that Brazil has a wonderful society; that Brazil is full of peace and love and all races get along; that Brazil has beautiful people &hellip; This ALWAYS coming from people who have never been to Brazil. Yet, they don&rsquo;t hesitate to praise it.</p>
<p>Well, I HAVE been there and I know better. But you can&rsquo;t tell it to those who don&rsquo;t want to hear.</p>
<p>Some years ago, I had a friend who spoke all his life about wonderfu Brazil  &mdash;  it was his picture of paradise on earth. Finally, in the last year of his life, when very ill, he took his savings and went there. It was to be his dream come true. He came back horriblly disappointed. He HATED it!<br>
 <br>

In Brazil the murder rate per year per 100,000 inhabitants is 22. In the United States it is 5.<br>

		<p>&#8220;Because Americans were overwhelming of European descent in 1890, the practical effect of these laws was an enormous thumb on the scale encouraging white immigration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the Immigration Laws of 1924 weren&rsquo;t intended to keep non-WHITES out, they were intended to keep Southern and Eastern Europeans, as well as Jews and Catholics in general, out of the country.  Non-white immigrants were very few in number, and were primarily Asians, who were excluded with the seperate Chinese Exclusion Act.</p>
