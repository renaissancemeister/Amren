			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cesar Chavez&rsquo;s California retreat has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced the designation of the site in the Tehachapi Mountains where the labor leader lived and led the farm workers movement the last 22 years of his life.</p>
<p>Salazar, who called Chavez &#8220;one of the heroes of the 20th century,&#8221; made the announcement at a gathering of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The 187-acre Nuestra Senora Reina de La Paz in Keene, southeast of Bakersfield, served as headquarters of the United Farm Workers and Chavez&rsquo;s residence from 1971 to 1993. It is now home to the National Chavez Center. Chavez was buried there in 1993.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the leader of the United Farm Workers union, Chavez staged a massive grape boycott that raised awareness of the plight of predominantly Latino farmworkers. His efforts were credited with inspiring millions of other Latinos in their fight for more educational opportunities, better housing and more political power.</p>

		<p>With Diversity and Inclusion, it&rsquo;s always a lie.</p>
<p>Public buses in Florida have been seen covered in Rosa Parks murals with the &#8220;I was just trying to get home&#8221; quotation.  </p>
<p>Diversity achieves nothing on its own.  Each step has been enabled by Whites who surrendered.  Soon, the Whites will be out of the way, and we&rsquo;ll just try to survive as the Diversity dukes it out over the spoils of what we left behind.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give anything to your church, alma mater, civic association, etc, because it will be owned and destroyed by Diversity.    Withhold, entrench, beware and prepare.  Times like these call for new goals, strategies, and tactics.  You must admit your second class status and fight against being pushed even lower.  Your total White degradation is their goal.  <br>

		<p>Nice house for a poor, min wage earning migrant worker.  Let&rsquo;s see, his efforts inspired millions of migrant workers to fight for educational opportunities, better housing and political power - NONE of which comes from the employers.  Only tax dollars will be providing those benefits while the pickers continue to work off the box for less than min wage and avail themselves of welfare, medicaid, in state tuition, ERs as their primary care provider, etc.  Anybody got the insights into how Chavez acquired the bucks to afford that 187 acres and mansion?</p>

<p>Yes, I know Chavez (seemed) to be opposed to illegal immigration.  At some point in 1969, he, Ralph Abernathy and Walter Mondale jointly held a protest against illegal immigration at the Mexican border.  Chavez also led a &#8220;Minuteman&#8221; style patrol against illegal aliens.</p>
<p>However, I can&rsquo;t shake the feeling that we&rsquo;re misinterpreting those actions and events, somehow falsely equating them to our cause.  </p>
<p>If Cesar Chavez were so against illegal immigration, why is hisright hand person, Dolores Huerta (who is still living), an open borders fanatic?  If Mondale was against illegal immigration, why were his Senate votes consistently for open borders?  If Abernathy was against illegal immigration, then why was/is most of the black civil rights leaders and elected politicians for amnesty and open borders, and have been for a long time?  </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that this protest took place in 1969, four years AFTER the borders were legally swung wide open for all intents and purposes.  Mondale was in the Senate at the time   &mdash;   I think he voted for the &#8216;65 Immigration act.  Did he repudiate his own vote?  I don&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>They talk about Chavez&rsquo;s &#8220;Minuteman&#8221; style patrols, but I think his motivation had far more to do with labor union organizing than anything.  In other words, he wasn&rsquo;t trying to catch illegal aliens for the sake of their being illegal aliens, he wanted to brutalize scab labor.</p>
<p>Sorry, but there&rsquo;s something not quite right about this picture.  At the very least, we shouldn&rsquo;t think that Chavez, Mondale and Abernathy shared our kind of motivations against illegal immigration.</p>

		<p>Only a tight labor market can help manual laborers. What you want is a labor SHORTAGE, to drive up hourly wages. A labor SURPLUS, has the opposite effect. Its the age-old law of supply and demand. Intelligent Mexican-Americans would realize this. But race clouds their judgement, and a great many just aren&rsquo;t all that bright.</p>

		<p><i>Cesar Chavez&rsquo;s California retreat has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.</i></p>
<p>Oh great!  Another ersatz plastic god we Whites are forced to bow down to!!</p>
<p>Chavez already has a California state holiday all to himself, just like that other phony, michael king.  And like, king:    <i>an investigation found, Chavez&rsquo;s heirs run a web of tax-exempt organizations that exploit his legacy and invoke the harsh lives of farmworkers to raise millions of dollars in public and private money.Most of the funds go to burnish the Chavez image and expand the family business, a multimillion-dollar enterprise with an annual payroll of $12 million that includes a dozen Chavez relatives.</i></p>
<p>As for Chavez&rsquo;s &#8220;retreat&#8221;:</p>
<p><i>Chavez&rsquo;s heirs broke with labor solidarity and hired nonunion workers to build the $3.2-million National Chavez Center around their founder&rsquo;s grave in the Tehachapi Mountains, a site they now market as a tourist attraction and rent out for weddings.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/Qv2YG" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/Qv2YG</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before the entire nation celebrates &#8220;Cesar Chavez Day&#8221; and names barrio streets, parks and community centers in his honor. In Amarillo, Texas a bowling alley has been renamed in his memory.</p>
<p><i>As the leader of the United Farm Workers union, Chavez staged a massive grape boycott that raised awareness of the plight of predominantly Latino farmworkers.</i></p>
<p>Did Chavez&rsquo;s tactics work??  Did he achieve his dream of organizing ALL the nation&rsquo;s farmworkers?</p>
<p><i>Chavez&rsquo;s union fell like a stone from a membership of 70,000 in the mid- 1970s to only 5,000 today. In the UFW heartland, the Salinas Valley of California, the number of union contracts among vegetable growers has plummeted from 35 to only one at the present time</i></p>
<p>The von Mises Institute reports:</p>
<p><i>Unions are only successful in a market economy where the union can control the supply of labor: that is, when workers are few in number, and highly skilled, so that they are not easily replaceable. Migrant farm workers, on the contrary, and almost by definition, are in abundant, ever-increasing, ever-moving, and therefore &#8220;uncontrollable&#8221; supply&hellip;.The low wage of migrant farm workers is not a sign that they are &#8220;exploited&#8221;, but that they are low-skilled and easily replaceable.</i></p>
<p>OOOPPPS!!  Guess that didn&rsquo;t turn out as planned, even if Chavez DID study with Saul Alinsky for 10 years.  Alinsky advised Chavez against trying to organize farm workers stating  <i>It is like fighting on a constantly disintegrating bed of sand.</i></p>
<p>But, like the king legacy, none of this will matter:  Chavez will be held up as a hero and quasi-god fighting for &#8220;social justice&#8221; against &#8220;A White System&#8221; that did and does everything in its power to oppress poor, noble mexicans.</p>
<p>I know, because I hear it in the schools almost every day.</p>

<p>As I asked in the AR comments section here a few months back, when the Navy dedicated a supply ship the USNS Cesar Chavez: what exactly is it that Chavez did that warrants this level of adulation and glorification? What were the &#8220;heroics&#8221; this man performed that his name should be invoked with such awe and his life so celebrated? </p>
<p>Because all Chavez actually did was to advocate on behalf of farm workers. Latino farm workers. His own people. He advocated on behalf of his own people, in the very narrow world of West Coast agriculture. He was just another labor leader. History has produced hundreds of labor leaders   &mdash;   but unless you&rsquo;re a professional union guy or an academic specializing in the history of US labor relations, there is no reason for anybody to remember their names. </p>
<p>And yet EVERYBODY knows the name Cesar Chavez. He&rsquo;s the brown MLK. </p>
<p>Please understand, I have nothing against someone trying to get better wages for lettuce-pickers. Unions versus management, capital versus labor   &mdash;   these are merely the familiar components of our economic system. As a capitalist, I don&rsquo;t particularly like unions myself, but I certainly understand why they exist and would never try to outlaw them. But I fail to see how marching around with placards saying &#8220;UNFAIR!&#8221; etc qualifies as any sort of achievement worthy of official celebration. Chavez was just a man working on behalf of his &#8220;employers&#8221; in the union. This makes him no more and no less &#8220;moral&#8221; or &#8220;inspiring&#8221; than a lawyer arguing a case on behalf of his client; or an ad man striving to make people buy Kellogg&rsquo;s rather than some other brand of cereal. </p>
<p>Do we name ships after lawyers and ad men? No we sure don&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>Look at what the United Farm Workers Union dues bought for Ceasar!  Those who felt it was a scam all along are vindicated.  Just another guy who wanted to live large on the backs of others.</p>
