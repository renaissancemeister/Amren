			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Henry, Telegraph (London), September 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz to Meg, the good witch from the Meg and Mog children&rsquo;s books, witches have always dressed in black.</p>
<p>But their traditional attire has now come in for criticism from equality experts who claim it could send a negative message to toddlers in nursery and lead to racism.</p>
<p>Instead, teachers should censor the toy box and replace the pointy black hat with a pink one, while dressing fairies, generally resplendent in pale pastels, in darker shades.</p>
<p>Another staple of the classroom  &mdash;  white paper  &mdash;  has also been questioned by Anne O&rsquo;Connor, an early years consultant who advises local authorities on equality and diversity.</p>
<p>Children should be provided with paper other than white to drawn on and paints and crayons should come in &#8220;the full range of flesh tones&#8221;, reflecting the diversity of the human race, according to the former teacher.</p>
<p>Finally, staff should be prepared to be economical with the truth when asked by pupils what their favourite colour is and, in the interests of good race relations, answer &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;brown&#8221;.</p>
<p>The measures, outlined in a series of guides in Nursery World magazine, are aimed at avoiding racial bias in toddlers as young as two.</p>
<p>According to the guides, very young children may begin to express negative and discriminatory views about skin colour and appearance that nursery staff must help them &#8220;unlearn&#8221;.</p>
<p>If children develop positive associations with dark colours, the greater the likelihood that the attitude will be generalised to people, it says.</p>
<p>The advice is based on an &#8220;anti-bias&#8221; approach to education which developed in the United States as part of multiculturalism.</p>
<p>It challenges prejudices such as racism, sexism and ageism through the whole curriculum and teaches children about tolerance and respect and to critically analyse what they are taught and think.</p>
<p>Ms O&rsquo;Connor, who has worked with Newham and Tower Hamlets councils and recently devised equality material for Lancashire council&rsquo;s childcare service, said the approach, based on an &#8220;anti-bias&#8221; model of education, developed children&rsquo;s empathy and helped early years teachers to explore their own conditioning and possible prejudices.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an incredibly complex subject that can easily become simplified and inaccurately portrayed,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a tendency in education to say &#8216;here are normal people and here are different people and we have to be kind to those different people&rsquo;, whether it&rsquo;s race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age or faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who are feeling defensive can say &#8216;well there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with white paper&rsquo;, but in reality there could be if you don&rsquo;t see yourself reflected in the things around you. &#8220;As an early years teacher, the minute you start thinking, &#8216;well actually, if I give everyone green paper, what happens&rsquo;, you have a teaching potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;People might criticise this as political correctness gone mad. But it is because of political correctness we have moved on enormously. If you think that we now take it for granted that our buildings and public highways are adapted so people in wheelchairs and with pushchairs can move around. Years ago if you were in a wheelchair, then tough luck. We have completely moved and we wouldn&rsquo;t have done that without the equality movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret Morrissey, a spokeswoman for the Parents Outloud campaigning group disagrees. She said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m sure these early years experts know their field but they seem to be obsessed about colour and determined to make everyone else obsessed about it too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not allowing toy witches to wear black seems to me nonsense and in the same vein as those people who have a problem with &#8216;Bar Bar Black Sheep&rsquo; or &#8216;The Three Little Pigs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Children just see a sheep in a field, whether it be black, grey, white or beige. I have worked with children for 41 years and I don&rsquo;t believe I have ever met a two year old who was in any way racist or prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, recent research by Professor Lord Winston provides evidence that children as young as four can hold racist views. In an experiment carried out for the BBC&rsquo;s Child of our Time series, children were presented with a series of images of faces of men, women, boys or girls. Only one of the faces in each sequence was white.</p>
<p>Children were asked to pick out the face of the person they wanted as their friend and the person they thought would be most likely to get in to trouble.</p>
<p>Almost all white children in the survey associated positive qualities exclusively with photographs of white children or adults. More than half of the black children made the same associations.</p>
<p>In contrast, people with darker faces were viewed as troublemakers.</p>

The Russians did this for 70 years.  Nursery school indoctrination was behind the law that everyone must get out of the house to some sort of workplace every day.</p>

<p>Because they are.  The black kids probably associated the black faces with mommy who beats and screams at them, Mommy&rsquo;s boyfriend who beats and molests them, people they see fighting and menacing on the street and in shops and nasty little bullies their own age and color on playgrounds and in nursery school.</p>

		<p>I am offended by the fact that all toilet paper is colored white. This obviously promotes racism towards whites, and leads kids to believe caucasians are trash to be thrown away. When a white child realizes all toilet paper is the same color as their skin they begin to feel worthless, and fail in school. I think in all fairness toilet paper should be colored to reflect the entire spectrum of flesh tones.</p>

Sure, this is so absurd Monty Python couldn&rsquo;t have made it up, but &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; is a profitable racket for people like this O&rsquo;Connor person, or that horrible &#8220;Blue Eyes&#8221; woman, these inquisitors of the racial orthodoxy. There&rsquo;s always work at some corporation or government agency for diversity &#8220;experts&#8221; and &#8220;consultants&#8221; to teach anti-White hate.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve heard of ridiculous euphemisms, but being &#8220;economical with the truth&#8221;, instead of &#8220;lying&#8221; takes the cake!  Of course, to liberals, there&rsquo;s apparently no such thing as the truth  &mdash;  or rather, it&rsquo;s whatever any individual wants it to be.  <br>
I&rsquo;m sure others will mention this too, but I can&rsquo;t resist:<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the disproportionate amount of crime committed by blacks and &#8220;Asians&#8221; in the UK for this (quite correct and perfectly understandable) bias. </p>

<p>Okay.  Thus, more food in the cafeteria should be fried to increase positive associations with the color brown.  &#8216;Blacklisted&rsquo; should be &#8216;whitelisted&rsquo; and &#8216;whitewash&rsquo; should be &#8216;blackwash.&rsquo;  Economic lessons that speak of being in the red or in the black should instead speak of being in the frowny or in the smiley.  A black band should be introduced to the rainbow.  The metal gold should be called by its chemical name &#8216;Au.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t the case that schools really do teach this kind of nonsense.</p>

It&rsquo;s pretty hard to write on black paper. But it does make it clear why a huge percentage of UK youth graduate from school functionally illiterate. </p>
<p>If they worried less about diversity and the color of their paper and more about learning to read, the entire country would be better off. But then I guess Anne O&rsquo;Connor and her host of fellow diversity bureaucrats would be out of a job. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but I cannot have our clients sign an agreement on black paper. The letters will have to be in white and that&rsquo;s a no-no in pc world. Next time, our business documents will have drawings of multi-ethnic kids singing under a rainbow with rabbits playing around and I will have to advise the opposing parties that they have to send a non=white rep to sign the papers.</p>

<p>Seems the diversity pimps are going to be butting heads with the ecological pimps since only recycled paper is preferred, and colored paper (that&rsquo;s not a racist term is it? Perhaps I should say paper of color) is verboten. And pink?  That&rsquo;s sexist! /s Have these people no gender sensitivity?</p>

		<p>This is definately someone with too much time on their hands.</p>
<p>You see, this is the problem with ALL these would be nannies.</p>
<p>This is why agricultural advancement and the industrial revolution have ruined life.</p>
<p>Back in the day most people needed to be out tilling the fields from dawn until dusk - literally. Women such as Ms. O&rsquo;Connor were busy hauling water, cooking, sewing, etc.</p>
<p>All this work was needed just to keep body and soul together.</p>
<p>And I firmly believe that this is still what most people are best suited for, brute labor.</p>
<p>But instead of honest work, we mostly get nonsense now.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to get pushed back to circa 1800. We really aren&rsquo;t doing at all well with all this leisure we currently have.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Connor?  Time transport her back to Ireland in Cromwell&rsquo;s day.  She would learn the true meaning of bias and prejudice.<br>
If she survived that it is.</p>

		<p> The standard liberated cause lady  high strung hysterics I&rsquo;ve run into many times. Until recentlym, most women were busy working hard all day.</p>
<p>The women who could live leisurely usually occupied their time running the households, building up a solid social life for their spouses to enjoy, and watching the kids. They didn&rsquo;t worry overmuch about upending society; the first triumph of these idiots was Prohibition and then it all went downhill from there.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, their first triumph was the civil war according to Abe Lincoln&rsquo;s greeting to Harriet Beecher Stowe, <br>
&#8220;so you&rsquo;r the little lady who started this great big war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too bad we don&rsquo;t have convents anymore where Ms O&rsquo;Connor could spend all her time praying and harassing other nuns about the proper way to arrange their uniforms.</p>

		<p>To compare PC childrens indoctrination with the need for whelchair access is about as ridiculous as this whole story!</p>
<p>But I suppose it must be good that the BLACK board in the school room has been replaced with the whiteboard and marker pens. (Oh no, I mentioned WHITE board, can&rsquo;t have that!)</p>
<p>Will they still be able to read the story of BLACK beauty in schools? At a social gathering how will  we refer to the BLACK sheep of the family?</p>
<p>In science will they still teach about BLACK holes? How will they critcize the BLACK market in commerce class? This is all getting far too serious so here is the PC version of that well known nursery rhyme!</p>
<p>Baa Baa ethnic minority sheep,<br>

Yes Madam, yes sir, three metric measures full,<br>

		<p>Their drive to destroy anything White has come full circle. Even inanimate objects (crayons, paper, clothing, etc) is now defined as &#8220;racist&#8221;. When are we as White people going to put our foot down and put a stop to their obvious plan to wipe us off the face of the earth?  Isn&rsquo;t that what an ex-black &#8220;professor&#8221; said on C-SPAN right in public? Not much outrage came from our media, did it? </p>

		<p>This is without a doubt the STUPIDEST crap I have ever heard.  This woman diversity expert should be LOCKED AWAY for her own good and the sanity of society.<br>
People like this, with their &#8220;I&rsquo;m not Racist&#8221; meme, are undoubtedly completely INSANE.  Everyone has racial preferences, and that is ENTIRELY NATURAL and OK.<br>
The only people that seem to be truly problematically racist are those that pretend race doesn&rsquo;t exist.  Race exists and stereotypes have a FIRM BASIS in REALITY.<br>
Anyone who has a problem with that also has a problem with the TRUTH!</p>

		<p>I believe in the Divine Authorship of the Bible. </p>
<p>In the beginning, God said, &#8220;Let there be Light.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus said men loved &#8220;the dark&#8221; because there sins could not be seen. </p>

<p>The Bilbe is where we got our ideas about White and Black and Light and Dark. We are told that God is Light and that in Heaven there will never again be darkness.</p>

<p>And lastly, White women are the loveliest creatures on God&rsquo;s Earth. I am sure that some loud, obese, hateful non-White female will soon demand we outlaw White hotties.</p>

		<p>The stupidest thing in this utterly ridiculously stupid article is to have teachers tell the kids that their favorite colors were &#8220;black or brown&#8221;. Kids dont think that way and it is ridiculous for these so called educators to think that a teacher lying about her favorite colors is going to somehow improve race relations. This kind of group think reminds me of Muslims being encouraged to have green and white as their favorite colors since their prophet had these as his favorites. </p>

		<p>Well, obviously, the problem here is that there ARE colors.  If there were no colors, there would be no Color-based Prejudice and Discrimination.</p>
<p>Therefore, my modest proposal for England is that they outlaw all colors.  Everything must be a uniform Greige: symbolic both of a world without evil Whites, and of the ideal nihilistic state of nothingness.</p>
<p>Paper will be Value 5 Greige.  Crayons will be Value 5 Greige.  Thus, even if forbidden thoughts are written, or if forbidden images are drawn, those words and pictures will have never existed, because no one will have been able to see them.</p>
<p>All that was formerly known as &#8220;good&#8221; will, too, have disappeared.  But &#8220;good&#8221; will have been mere collateral damage.  Better to destroy all that was considered &#8220;good&#8221;, than to allow the continued existence of things which might run counter to rigorous Ideology.</p>
<p>It is Ideology which is real.  Reality is not real: not in England.</p>

		<p>Racism is as natural to man as sex.  <br>
<p><br>
Interestingly the Black and White races go about policing racism and sex differently.  In Africa Blacks have little suppression of sex and do not at all suppress racist behavior towards outside tribes.<br>
<p><br>
In America the Black culture follows the same pattern suppressing neither sex nor their racism.  White culture is different; it suppresses sex and suppresses racism.<br>
<p><br>
However, the White race has not completely suppressed the natural urge for sex but has channeled the natural sex urge into monogamy.  This has been a boon to Western man.  Freud noticed the beneficial effects of suppressing sex.  Civilization, art, work, scientific progress all are according to him a result of suppressing sex.  <br>
<p><br>
Un-suppressing sex has been a major project of the anti-Western and anti-Christian forces in the 20th century.  But this so-call liberating process has turned out to be an endless project.  There have been gains, feminism, pornography, easy divorce have taken a toll, but still White people, outside New You and Hollywood, are for suppressing sex by monogamy.<br>
<p><br>
Racism and sex are very close to being equally difficult to suppress.  Sex has probably a slight edge.   Both are deeply imbedded in the psyche of man.<br>
<p><br>
The White people have found a successful way to suppress sex.  They are free to gratify their natural urge for sex in monogamy.  But what about their natural urge for racism, the desire to segregate, to be among their own kind, or to reproduce their own kind, to be racists?<br>
<p><br>
The American rulers are forcing White people to totally suppress their natural proclivity to racism.  They are not giving them an outlet to gratify that very basic human urge.  That is if you are White.<br>
<p><br>
White people must completely stifle the deep-seated and strong urge of racism.  Non-Whites are free to gratify their racist urge, not only are they free, but they are encouraged to do so by our rulers.<br>
<p><br>
A people cannot survive if it completely suppresses sex.  A people cannot survive if it completely suppresses the racism.  Sex and racism must be channeled into a beneficial cultural institution.  <br>
<p><br>
If our rulers made men and women mix in and walk around naked there would a big sex problem in America.  Our rulers don&rsquo;t force men and women to rub up against each other with no clothes on. But they do force White people to tolerate being rubbed up against by Blacks and other non-Whites and that is why we have a problem with racism.<br>

		<p>Among the myriad other things wrong with this most insane of articles, is that these &#8220;educators&#8221; are, at bottom, merely peddling this ever-so-popular, &#8220;skin-color = race&#8221; cannard. Skin pigmentation is, perhaps, the least notable aspect of what race really means and is. </p>
<p>Additionally, no one, not even children, associate color in and of itself with the various skin-tones of human racial-types. The idea that a teacher pretending to like the color brown will somehow translate to a child&rsquo;s better opinion of an Arab, African or what have you, is beyond ridiculous! </p>
<p>Those responsible for dreaming-up and propounding this absolute hogwash are not merely irresponsible or idiotic - they are criminals! This is child-abuse at the very least, and the not-so-subtle endorsement of ideological genocide taken to its illogical conclusion!   </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s see here. The simplest and most common situation for documents is white paper and black ink. The white paper is now said to be problematic although the article doesn&rsquo;t explain how it is so. May we presume that in the multi-culti nut brain the white paper &#8216;privileges whiteness&rsquo; and thus is &#8216;racist&rsquo; or at least is insensitive to non-white people. Never mind that &#8216;white people&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t actually white like white paper.</p>
<p>But what about the words appearing in black ink (or print). What are the racial implications of this? Does it &#8216;privilege blackness&rsquo; and is it insensitive to white people and &#8216;racist&rsquo; against white people?</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it the case that the words - in black - are more important than the white paper which is mere background and venue for the more important things - the words - which are the point of the document, the only thing giving it significance, conveying ideas and meaning.</p>
<p>And of course black people aren&rsquo;t actually black like black ink (print) either.</p>
<p>Perhaps the King of Siam said it best. &#8220;Is a puzzlement&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Finally, staff should be prepared to be economical with the truth when asked by pupils what their favourite colour is and, in the interest of good race relations, should answer &#8220;black&#8221; or &#8220;brown&#8221;. <br>
As one correspondent has pointed out, this is lying. This will have the effect on the teachers of destroying their own integrity, whether they begin with little or much. It will keep people to whom the truth of any matter is important, out of the teaching profession, leaving only the liars. </p>
<p>Race, in the &#8220;interest&#8221; of &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; and &#8220;anti-bias&#8221;, has now become the dominant theme in &#8220;teaching&#8221;. As the &#8220;favourite&#8221; colours are now black and brown, with white deliberately not being mentioned, the value of black and brown people goes up, and the value of white people goes down. It is a fact that to reduce the importance of something, you don&rsquo;t even mention it or consider it. White, with its association with white people, are not even consider to be important, because they are not mentioned. This is in a country that is predominantly white. </p>
<p>Education was once understood to be aimed at making a people proficient in literacy and numeracy, and to have a knowledge of one&rsquo;s origins and history. Now it can be clearly seen as being nothing more than indoctrination of two year olds into an &#8220;anti-bias&#8221; ideological prison. Again the children are being separated from and turned against their parents, by the state. </p>
<p>Margaret Morrissey&rsquo;s comments are spot on, and I&rsquo;m glad she has some fire in her belly. It really is an obsession for these people, and a most unhealthy one at that. I appreciate most of the comments that have been made, and the very necessary sense of humour that we need, as well as the truth, in the face of this madness and perversion.</p>

Last time I checked, I&rsquo;ve never heard of witch characters in fairy tales and stories depicted to wear pink. And most paper (such as paper for printers etc) in the world is white. What mindless person can tie racism into a piece of paper for heaven&rsquo;s sakes?

		<p>It strikes me as a kind of self-loathing, a cringing need for acceptance or validation by the people who come up with this stuff. It&rsquo;s no coincidence either that it&rsquo;s always directed against white people, because historically we are the group least likely to protest. Call it what it really is- dreadful racism. All over the world however, white peoples eyes are opening. If we&rsquo;re so awful, why does everyone else want to live in the societies we build? Send their children to our schools? Im convinced England will be the touchpaper for white people waking up and realizing that we are  worth protecting. And it won&rsquo;t be pretty.</p>

If you think that we now take it for granted that our buildings and public highways are adapted so people in wheelchairs and with pushchairs can move around. Years ago if you were in a wheelchair, then tough luck. We have completely moved and we wouldn&rsquo;t have done that without the equality movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Funny they should cite this as an example  of good political correctness, because in Britain the Diversity monkeys do very little for hindered people. Also a soldier coming back from Afghanistan or Iraq without an arm or a leg would probably get far, far less in payouts than a slightly offended Muslim, black or gay person. in fact trying to capitalize on the disability argument when the only time politically correctness really goes mad is when everyone&rsquo;s talking about racial offences.<br>

<p>A question for you. Do you honestly believe that God turned Ham&rsquo;s son into a black man? If so, where did the black race come from well before Ham was even born? Gen. 1 tells of the &#8220;creation&#8221; of other races, plants etc.. Gen. 2 tells of God &#8220;forming&#8221; Adam and Eve while blowing into his nostrils. HE created Eve for Adam because HE and Adam &#8220;looked&#8221; around and could not find a suitable mate for Adam. WHO were those people they &#8220;looked&#8221; at? Why was there no one suitable for Adam? These were TWO separate events that the church will never tell you about. Those two events were thousands of years apart (if not millions), not a &#8220;day&#8221; as we are led to believe. Otherwise, why have TWO separate chapters on these two completely different &#8220;creations&#8221; if it were just ONE creation? God isn&rsquo;t stupid as we seem to be. Remember a &#8220;day&#8221; in the Bible consists of thousands of years not man&rsquo;s 24 hour day. HE rested on the 7th day (after creation) and THEN He formed Adam. (Gen. 2)</p>
<p>The church tells us that ALL men are only 6,000 years old. How can that be? Even the Chinese have been here way longer than that with documented proof. Adam and Eve and their descendants are 6,000 years old, but not all of mankind. Too much evidence to the contrary. God made 3 distinct races of people, including Adam and Eve. The rest came from fallen mans mixing the seed lines. Adam and Eve did NOT have different races of offspring! That is impossible. That would totally go against God&rsquo;s Law. God does NOT break HIS own Law. Kind after kind was meant for man and not just the animals.</p>

They still exist in Ireland, Scotland, and England.  Christianity had to demonize them in order to establish and maintain their control.  </p>
<p>I refer any interested in real European history to the Cornell University publication, &#8220;Witchcraft and Demonology,&#8221; for the history of witch trails in Europe.  It is NOT a recent PC publication, but a historical record of the trails of &#8220;heretics&#8221; and &#8220;witch&#8221; trials.  One item I would like to relate here is that the laws allowed an exception in that children under ten were allowed to give testimony, and the judges and &#8220;executioners&#8221; shared in the victim&rsquo;s worldly possessions as pay for their &#8220;services.&#8221;  This led to many villages, and mid sized cities to be nearly completely depopulated in much of central France and Germany.  Hundreds of thousands died horrible deaths at the hands of these &#8220;holy&#8221; men.  </p>
<p>The epic of the arrival of yet another Middle Eastern based religion into Europe will likely produce another era of ignorance and civil purges similar to the long period of Christian purges in Europe.</p>
<p>I also recommend Amren posters to either read the book or view the films that render a historical period of white history:  Umberto Ecco&rsquo;s &#8220;The Name of the Rose,&#8221; and &#8220;The Crucible.&#8221;  Then ask yourself if that is the sort of white culture you want to go back to or repeat.  We must be beyond this.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And lastly, White women are the loveliest creatures on God&rsquo;s Earth. I am sure that some loud, obese, hateful non-White female will soon demand we outlaw White hotties.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feminazis have done that for decades.  It was one of their first manifestoes back in the days of White CPUSA members Betty Freidan and Buffalo Bella Abzug.</p>
<p>Nothing changes.  45 years later the latest feminazi crusade is<br>
&#8220;don&rsquo;t tell your daughter she&rsquo;s pretty.&#8221;  It will warp her somehow and prevent her from being the next Bill Gates, Donald Trump or Warren Buffet.</p>
<p>My Mother and all her friends were hard left feminazis.  I was always told good looks were bad.  Then I was elected prettiest girl in my 8th grade class and featured in the year book.</p>
<p>I looked in a mirror and noticed I looked very much like Courtney Cox.  So did my feminazi leftist Mother.</p>
<p>Most colleges have in their long list of offenses lookism along with ablism sexism racism whatever.  Lookism is thinking attractive people are better looking than ugly people. Specieism is thinking humans are more intelligent than plants and animals.<br>
Or something.</p>
<p>Liberalism is indeed a mental illness.  Didn&rsquo;t Lenin classify liberalism as an &#8220;infantile mental disorder&#8221;?  He knew what he was talking about.<br>

		<p>Embrace the liberals as sick and needing prayers. I am a recovering alcoholic who never understood the concept as alcoholism being a disease until I read up on articles relating to genetics &amp; addiction. Also a high number of people in my family (both Mom &amp; Dad&rsquo;s sides) have the disease. Same thing with liberal ideology. The only problem that has proven to be monumental to overcome is that it has afflicted almost half of the American population, if not more.</p>
<p>I always thought that the &#8220;left&#8221; wanted to tell people that science is to be irrefutable. Why then when it comes to race, science doesn&rsquo;t play a role. If we are surrounded by math and science it&rsquo;s a most assured probability that there are genetic differences in the races. I&rsquo;m not claiming &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;good&#8221; because it is relative to one&rsquo;s social norms and acceptabilities in one&rsquo;s environment. But there are differences. That is fact. Or if libs can&rsquo;t accept this, then they don&rsquo;t have the right to complain when someone on the &#8220;right&#8221; cries foul on climate change. Either science is in everything or it&rsquo;s not. You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.</p>

		<p>Well, being British myself, I could no doubt go on an endless rant about this kind of absurdity&hellip;..but I think I will try to look on the bright side instead.</p>
<p>This woman is clearly insane. Either that, or she knows how to make money from other deluded dupes that are wedded into this race-relations and &#8220;community cohesion&#8221; culture. </p>
<p>She is hopefully the exception rather than the rule - although without doubt it is a sliding scale and such farcical situations do eventually tend to trickle through the systems and the country unless they are nipped firmly in the bud and laughed/ridiculed out the staff room. </p>
<p>But this kind of craziness is not new. In fact there is a clip from the American show &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; which was broadcast in the early to mid 1980s that is along the same kinds of themes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4AxSG2iiI4" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4AxSG2iiI4</a></p>
<p>When articles like this appear in the press, you can be rest assured it is driving people right into our arms and makes otherwise brain-dead zombies a little bit more receptive to the message.</p>
<p>On that score, these crazy people coming up with this nonsense are probably worth a few million leaflets, as they are good recruiting sergeants in their own way!. </p>
<p>Whilst the majority of the public seem to be vacant minded and vacuously wired into X-Factor and &#8220;Strictly Dancing You&rsquo;ve Got the X-Factor On Ice with the Stars&#8221;&hellip;..there are still signs of sane life here in Britain, and people are quietly restless. </p>
<p>The trouble is, nothing seems to get done&hellip;..not least because there are no obvious levers to pull and no obvious ways of getting such initiatives and such people removed from policy formation. It is like chasing or plaiting fog&hellip;..and I do not think it is an accident. </p>
<p>One thing is for sure, it cannot and will not last forever. </p>
<p>Various situations are unravelling here and there is a bit of a feeling that a tide will turn. I just hope it does not turn back into the fold of the usual &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; safety nets and their false promises. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I also recommend Amren posters to either read the book or view the films that render a historical period of white history: Umberto Ecco&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Name of the Rose,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Crucible.&rdquo; Then ask yourself if that is the sort of white culture you want to go back to or repeat. We must be beyond this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both those books were written by hard left anti White racists for only one reason, to make Whites and our civilization look evil. The play and movies were made by the entertainment industry which has been on an anti White progrom since 1960.</p>
<p>The Crucible was written by a member of the American communist party. Senator McCarthy and before him President Truman and Congressman Nixon exposed the numerous hard core communist spies for Russia who had been infiltrating every agency of the federal goverment since 1933.</p>
<p>The Crucible was written to identify the actual communist Russian spies McCarthy exposed with innocent women victims<br>
of false witchcraft charges.  The propaganda effect was that seeing the Crucible would make people believe that there were no communist spies in America.</p>
<p>There are numerous books written proving that there were many communist spies in America and that McCarthy and Truman were right.  Start with Verona papers.</p>
<p>Crucible was nothing more than communist propaganda that there were no communists in our goverment.  Like Cloward Priven, I would not be surprised if the story were not thought of in Moscow and sent to CPUSA member Arthur Miller to finish and get produced.</p>
<p><br>
We almost had a communist President, Henry Wallace.  FDR made him FDR&rsquo;s 3rd vice President.  FDR and everyone around him knew FDR was dying of heart disease. Fortunately, the southern and northern labor union democrats were able to dump Wallace in favor of Truman for FDR&rsquo;s 4th presidency. Had FDR and his communist friends had their way, Henry Wallace, not Truman  would have been President when FDR died</p>
<p><br>
The communist threat was very real at the time the communist Arthur Miller wrote the Crucible to create sympathy for the communists in goverment and scorn for those who sought to expose them.</p>
<p>Umberto Eco is another communist anti White racist. His books are pure fiction and not based on anything that ever happened as the Crucible was. </p>
<p><br>
There are various numbers quoted re witches killed in Europe. Some of the more hysterical pro witch books claim more killed than there were women in Germany at the time. It is not my field of interest.</p>
<p>Cornell U is Cornell U, an anti White anti Western civilization <br>
propaganda machine like every other college and university in the country.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t believe a thing coming out of any Cornell history department any more than I would believe Ms Hartman of Harvard wishes to do an objective study of White nationalists.</p>
<p>Cornell&rsquo;s book of Witchcraft and Demonology may be true.  But nothing repeat nothing coming out of any liberal arts department of any American university or college in the last 50 years has been true. Every book and article published has been anti White racist and anti our civilization.  Our civilization is not perfect but the alternative, our genocide is worse.</p>
<p>Consider the source before you believe anything published by Cornell University.</p>
<p>If you are a Wiccan fine.  But please don&rsquo;t believe anything coming out of any liberal arts department of any university.<br>

<p>There is a post a few days ago about nursery school teachers reporting 2 and 3 year olds to the police and the police entering their names into a hate crime data base for alleged racist comments.</p>
<p>It all seems ridiculous when it first starts.  No one ever thought give a job to a black instead of a White with the same qualifications until a 12 percent black quota was achieved would result in a ban on White employment. The result is that every ethnic group on earth is entitled to come here and get a goverment job within a a year of arrival solely on the grounds that the person is not White.</p>

Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 are both accounts of the same creation event, but each have a different focus. Genesis 1 is the overall picture which presents God as Creator amongst other things. Genesis 2 is a more personal account where the focus is on the creation of the man and the woman. <br>
Genesis 1 does not tell of the creation of other races at all, but of the first man and woman. Adam and Eve are not a race, but a couple from whom all races sprang, but more on that later. </p>
<p>Both the man and the woman were created on the sixth day (Gen 1:26-28), not after God resting, or after the seventh as you say. </p>
<p>The days in this context, are not thousands or millions of years, but 24 hour days. Six times it is said that each day had an evening and a morning. All animal, plant and human life is attuned to a 24 hour cycle, not a thousand or million year &#8220;day&#8221; or cycle. How would you know the difference between a thousand year evening and a thousand year morning? What criteria would you use?</p>
<p>Adam didn&rsquo;t look at people, he looked at animals, as God had brought them before him to see what he would call them (Gen. 2:19). This is an expression of the humans &#8220;having dominion over &hellip;fishes&hellip;birds&hellip;and every living thing that moves on the face of the earth&#8221; (Gen. 1:28). It was through this act of naming the animals that Adam was brought face to face with the realisation that there was none like him upon the face of the earth. He was made in God&rsquo;s image (Gen. 1:26) having rationality, creativity, holiness and as a purposeful, relational being. </p>
<p>God knew that it was not good for man to be alone (being made as a relational being), but Adam learnt it in an experiential way. Hence the creation of the woman from the man. Why was there no one suitable for Adam? Because animals are animals, and humans are not, but were to be bearers of God&rsquo;s image in their essence and behaviour. This the basis for no sexual relationships with animals. </p>
<p>Did God turn Ham into a black man? Nowhere does Scripture say that He did, and here I agree with you. This then leads to the question, where did the races come from? While you say that &#8220;God does not break His own law&hellip;Kind after kind was meant for man and not just the animals&#8221;. I agree with the first sentence, and the second, BUT the term &#8220;mankind&#8221; applies to every race, because all are human, and all belong to the human race. Each race can interbreed with each other, as some bemoan on this site. Try that with a monkey and see how far you get. There&rsquo;s a barrier there that accords with the Genesis account. </p>
<p>But back to the races. Fast forward to Genesis 6 to 11 to the tower of Babel. Here you will see the beginning of the races, because of the confusion wrought by Divinely introduced different languages. Different language groups then held or concentrated different, but human genetic information. Then you get the human dispersion to cover the earth which was God&rsquo;s original intention (Gen. 1:28), which post-Flood humans were resisting (Gen. 11:1-4). </p>
<p>The variation between the races that you think impossible doesn&rsquo;t necessitate different parents or ancient ancestry, but rather illustrates the tremendous potential for difference within the genetic information of humans. Where it is concentrated in language groups in different locales, you end up with what we have today. </p>
<p>I am aware at this point that some may deride me as a young earther or a Christian dingbat, but my conclusion, I believe, is the same as yours; that the white race has great value and should maintain and magnify its existence. There is no need to exterminate it by miscegenation or by any other means. </p>
<p>I could say lots more but perhaps this is enough for tonight. Maybe I have raised more questions, but my main thrust was to graciously (I hope!) address the posted misinformation about what Genesis says about our origins. <br>

<p>I still stand by the two separate &#8220;creation&#8221; accounts in Gen 1 and Gen. 2.</p>
<p>I stand by the account I have given. According to Genesis, this book (Bible) was written SOLELY to the descendants of Adam. NO OTHER. That means no other RACE of people. Different races did NOT biologically come from Adam and Eve. <br>

<p>I still believe that God stayed with HIS own law. Kind after kind meant within one&rsquo;s own genetic race. HE does not change HIS mind to be PC&hellip; Doesn&rsquo;t matter that people &#8220;can&#8221; interbreed with each other.( and yes, I &#8220;bemoan&#8221; the fact that the races have interbred) I also believe that God also bemoans that fact.

<p>You go on to say.</p>

<p>Sorry, I do not agree with your interpretation. God did NOT turn them into different &#8220;races&#8221; because HE jumbled their &#8220;languages&#8221;. They were already of different races.</p>
<p>Like I said before HE does not go against HIS own Laws. To magically transform a race of people into different races is hocus pocus. God is not a magician. HE did speak about those &#8220;magicians&#8221; in the Bible. Do you believe that the Ammorites, etc. that God warred with, were of the same race as Adam and Eve and Noah and his family? </p>
<p>If that &#8220;land&#8221; of the flood was &#8220;worldwide&#8221; as so many are led to believe, then ALL the different races had to come from a pure (race) of generation, Noah, and his pure of race family. Is that even possible? Of course not. God would never resort to becoming a &#8220;magician&#8221;.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>I will not go on, as there is so much to say, but I do honestly respect your reply. <br>

<p>I think the answer is simple. Do you remember drawing yourself and your family as a child? You probably drew on white paper and just left the face uncoloured. The white of the paper represented the &#8220;white&#8221; skins of your family and yourself. <br>
Black and brown people can&rsquo;t represent themselves with simple pencil lines on white paper like that, they have to colour the faces in, which for a child that age is a more difficult process and would probably create an ugly mess, so &#8220;whiteness&#8221; is being privileged, and we can&rsquo;t have that.  </p>

 the same madness is in Oregon too.<br>
New bilingual electrical safety education play showing in local schools<br>
PGE - 09/29/11<br>
- &#8220;Pedro&rsquo;s Path to Power&#8221; uses theatre to teach K-3 students about making smart choices - </p>
<p><br>
PORTLAND, Ore. - In an effort to educate youth about electrical safety, Portland General Electric and Oregon Children&rsquo;s Theatre are partnering to present Pedro&rsquo;s Path to Power, a bilingual interactive musical about electrical safety. Written by Playwright Matt Zrebski, the production uses song, dance and audience participation to teach kindergarten through third-grade students they have the power to make smart, safe choices around electricity. </p>
<p>&#8220;Electricity is an amazing part of our lives, but can also be dangerous, so it&rsquo;s imperative we help young people understand how electricity works,&#8221; said Kregg Arntson, PGE&rsquo;s community affairs manager. &#8220;Through Pedro&rsquo;s Path to Power, students learn what it takes to be safe around electricity as well as the power of making smart choices.&#8221; </p>
<p>The 30-minute play, free to schools, follows 7-year-old Pedro, played by actor Alberto Romero, on his path to power where he learns about electricity - how it&rsquo;s made, where it comes from and why it&rsquo;s important to make safe choices. Pedro and his friend, Serena, played by actress Rebecca Martinez, are playing baseball when Pedro hits a homerun and the ball flies over the fence. They peer over the fence to fetch the ball, but encounter a downed power line. Pedro is stopped by his mother before he makes it over the fence, and his path to understanding power and making safe choices begins. </p>
<p>Songs like &#8220;Spin Go Flip That Switch,&#8221; and &#8220;Shock Like Pow,&#8221; teach Pedro and the audience where electricity comes from and how to use it safely. On his journey Pedro befriends interactive characters like Socket Monster, a giant wall socket, and Power, a superhero-interpretation of electricity, who help Pedro discover the true path to power is about making smart choices. </p>
<p>Sprinkled with Spanish phrases, Pedro&rsquo;s Path to Power, breaks both cultural and language barriers students may face. &#8220;The production has the potential to do many things,&#8221; said Playwright Matt Zrebski. &#8220;Not only is it practical to have electrical safety tips in Spanish, I think it has even more impact in helping some students feel more included in their school and communities.&#8221; </p>
<p>The tour will visit 30 schools in PGE&rsquo;s operations area through October 21. </p>

<p>Thank you for your response. I appreciate the discourse. However, as you now know, I could not agree with your some of your original post, nor can I agree with some of your second post. </p>
<p>For a start,  you say, &#8220;I stand by the account I have given. According to Genesis, this book (Bible) was written SOLELY to the descendants of Adam. NO OTHER. That means no other RACE of people. Different races did NOT biologically come from Adam and Eve&#8221;. </p>
<p>I agree with your first point because Scripture points to all as having descended from the first couple. Adam and Eve are presented as the primogenitors of the entire human race. Their historicity, and the Genesis account is attested by no less than Jesus Christ in Matthew 19:4 ff.  He also said that his words  were &#8220;not mine, but His that sent Me&#8221; (John 7:16, 14:24). If he is not speaking the truth, then one can then only conclude that He is a liar or a lunatic. But his life doesn&rsquo;t portray those options. </p>
<p>You say,  &#8220;I still believe that God stayed with HIS own law. Kind after kind meant within one&rsquo;s own genetic race. HE does not change HIS mind to be PC&hellip; Doesn&rsquo;t matter that people &ldquo;can&rdquo; interbreed with each other.( and yes, I &ldquo;bemoan&rdquo; the fact that the races have interbred) I also believe that God also bemoans that fact. It was forbidden by God Himself&#8221;.</p>
<p>Question. Where in Scripture does God do this forbidding? </p>
<p>If you look at the Genesis account or in a Concordance (mine is by Young), you will find that from Genesis to Ezekiel,  the word kind (species) is only applied to fruit, herbs, fowl, cattle, and animals, but never humans. There are no separate kinds of humans in this sense, but there are different ethnic groups with different physical, intellectual, and I think, psychological traits/distinctives. We use the word race for taxonomic classification, but even if we didn&rsquo;t, another word meaning the same thing would have to be substituted. </p>
<p>I wholeheartedly believe that &#8220;God doesn&rsquo;t change His mind to be PC&#8221;. Political correctness is murderous to racial/ethnic identity, but mainly to white identity and existence. It is the same to the male sex, and to the concept of God and Christ. It is reprehensible that many Christians and denominations apparently fall into the PC line, as if it was of God. </p>
<p>You say, &#8220;Like I said before HE does not go against HIS own Laws. To magically transform a race of people into different races is hocus pocus. God is not a magician. HE did speak about those &ldquo;magicians&rdquo; in the Bible. Do you believe that the Ammorites, etc. that God warred with, were of the same race as Adam and Eve and Noah and his family?&#8221;</p>
<p>I have not said that He &#8220;magically&#8221; transforms one race into different races. My point, or the Bible&rsquo;s picture was that God having confused (hence Babel, meaning confusion) the one people, drove them apart to fulfil His original intention, not allowing them to fulfil theirs, which would have led them right back to pre-Flood wickedness. Stemming from that flocking together on the basis of language, is the fact that different characteristics would become evident in time due to the &#8220;gene pool&#8221; that they possessed, and whatever genetic loss they suffered through mutation. It is not magic, but what happens over time. </p>
<p>I agree that God is not a magician. He deals in truth and meaning, not illusion and deception. As for the Amorites who descended from Canaan, are you aware that they were allies of Abraham (then Abram) (Gen. 14:13), but later their descendants were opposed to Abraham&rsquo;s descendants? I see no problem here, though God later warred against them for their wickedness. It&rsquo;s a bit like the Italians who were our allies in WW1, then our enemies in WW2. Change of belief led to change of behaviour. </p>
<p>Are they of the same race as Adam, Eve, and Noah? Yes, and you can follow the line through the table of nations in Genesis 10. </p>
<p>May I recommend to you two books and one website before I go. They are &#8220;After the Flood; The early post-flood history of Europe traced back to Noah&#8221; by Bill Cooper from New Wine Press, Chichester, England.<br>
The second is &#8220;Faith of our Fathers; God in Ancient China&#8221; by Chan Kei Thong, 2006. This deals with the early Chinese history showing that they held to basically the Genesis account of origins, worship of the one God, Babel, and subsequent human dispersion.<br>
The website is Creation.com, an Australian site. </p>
<p>As I need to prepare two papers/messages for tomorrow and Sunday, please excuse me for not responding immediately to anyone who may post a challenge to this one. </p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Robert from Australia.  </p>

		<p>This latest nonsense in Britain is on a long trajectory dating from the 1970s when local government in some areas, and the education system more generally, were gradually subverted by left-wing &#8220;anti-racists; they themselves called this process &#8220;agenda networking&#8221;.<br>
I have started working on a book about &#8220;The Murder of England&#8221; which will document this process (among other damaging policies in defence, economics, &c;) which fortunately has reached its reductio ad nauseam.<br>
Years ago teachers were told to call blackboards &#8220;chalkboards&#8221;, and ask for coffee without milk (not black).  These are not tabloid press fairy-tales; I was around when it happened.<br>
At one school in the now gang-ridden London Borough of Waltham Forest, where the staff had to &#8220;multiculturalise&#8221; the curriculum<br>
in ALL subjects (easy to fix and fake in history, geography and even literature in English, but not physics or biology) the West Indian gym teacher groaned despairingly &#8220;They&rsquo;ll expect us to do f  &mdash;    &mdash;  - limbo dancing next&#8221;, and the Indian head of maths protested, &#8220;But I teach the same maths that I taught in Uganda&#8221;. &#8220;Just tell them you use the Hindu zero, Greek theorems and Arabic numerals,&#8221; I advised, sending him away with a relieved grin.  These are among a few funny episodes in what has been a profoundly and cunningly evil process.<br>
The worm is turning slowly for the phlegmatic English, but they have yet to become a huge dragon.   </p>

PGE - 09/29/11<br>
- &ldquo;Pedro&rsquo;s Path to Power&rdquo; uses theatre to teach K-3 students about making smart choices -&#8220;</p>
<p>There were 5 children in my family. 3 were very rowdy boys who had lots of male friends who spent much time at our house.  Our Mother did not supervise us very much, especially the boys.</p>
<p>There were no lessons our warnings about electrical safety.  There was not 1 injury or any kind of problem from electricity during from the time the oldest was born to the time the youngest left home.</p>
<p>This is just the electric company finding any and all excuses for multicult propaganda work.  It was probably advised by counsel that doing a program about black kids not knowing about electricity would be deemed racist and bigoted.</p>
<p>Most kids, especially boys  like danger and experimentation.  Telling them about the dangers of electricity will just encourage them to act stupidly about it.  If the boys who see this are anything like my brothers and their friends were they will go looking for dangerous power lines.</p>

<p>Been away for a time from my computer. I still disagree with your assessment of we are all ONE race, not 3 different and distinct races of men. I still maintain Gen.1 and Gen.2 are two separate events over thousands of years&hellip;</p>
<p>As for God not wanting miscegenation between those 3 races I stand firm. If He wanted it, He would have made all the races we see today or never created 3 separate races to begin with.</p>
