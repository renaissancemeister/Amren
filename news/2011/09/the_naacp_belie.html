<p>Jeff Greenwell, Business Insider, September 7, 2011</p>

<p>Really America&hellip;really? Has it come to this, that the word &#8220;bro&#8221; is considered to be racist, even when it&rsquo;s used as part of an Internet meme that&rsquo;s been around for years?</p>
<p>Apparently it has, at least in parts of Ohio. Near the end of a high school football game between Kirtland and Painesville Harvey, a group of Kirtland students and parents raised a sign that read &#8220;You Mad Bro?&#8221; which, for the uninformed, is a popular meme designed &#8220;to make a raging person rage even more by asking the most ironic question,&#8221; as per the Urban Dictionary.</p>
<p>Some people took offense to the sign, not because it was a show of poor sportsmanship, but because of it&rsquo;s racial undertones.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>From Fox 8 Cleveland&hellip;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the conclusion of the game, some of their students and parents put up a sign that we believe was racial intimidation, ethnic intimidation,&#8221; said Roderick Coffee, president of the Lake County chapter of the NAACP, who was also at the game.</p>
<p>{snip}</p></blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school plans on conducting a full investigation. Let&rsquo;s hope all they find is that people have become way too sensitive in this PC driven day and age.</p>
