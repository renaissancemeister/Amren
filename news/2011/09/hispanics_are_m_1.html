<h1>Hispanics Are More Affected by Arthritis</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My Latino Voice, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An estimated 3.1 million Hispanics are living with arthritis according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), yet this critical health issue and its debilitating effects are not widely discussed.  On September 20-21, <em>Movement is Life</em> will present the second annual Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Health Disparities caucus to address these critical issues. </p>
<p>Studies have shown that Latinos, African-Americans and women are disproportionately affected by arthritis and have more severe pain and limitation. According to the CDC, Hispanics and African Americans are nearly twice as likely as whites to have severe joint pain and work limitations.  Among Latinos with arthritis, at least one in five reported a significant arthritis attributable effect, including severe joint pain and activity or work limitations. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthritis is the single greatest cause of chronic pain and disability, particularly among Hispanics, and finding a solution is critical,&#8221; said Alberto Bolanos, MD, Co-Founder, American Association of Latino Orthopaedic Surgeons.  &#8220;By working together, we can decrease gender and racial musculoskeletal health disparities.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Movement is Life</em> aims to decrease the current existing gaps in musculoskeletal care delivery by raising awareness of the benefits of chronic disease management.  {snip}</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t this the gist of the whole article? Of course, that&rsquo;s it. WORK LIMITATIONS! They have it soooo severe that they cannot work. Bring out the SSA/SSI disability forms, pronto. Let them drain even more of the SSA that Whitey has paid for all their lives. They already have welfare, foster care, and section 8 down to a tee, so let us now provide them with SSI&hellip;I have had osteoarthritis for years and still had to work. No limitations either.</p>

		<p>I always have to read these stories of &#8216;disparities&rsquo; in ailments between the various (supposedly nonexistent) races. At work at my health insurance job I can&rsquo;t resist posing seemingly innocent questions like &#8220;maybe we should make sure more White people have arthritis?&#8221; Some of my co-workers will snicker, but most just stare blankly at me. I assume they are holding in their displeasure at me for making light of such an &#8216;important&rsquo; concern. </p>
<p>It seems counter-intuitive that those elements in society that have most of their healthcare paid for by the taxpayer still have the most health problems. They supposedly have &#8216;less access to care&rsquo; even though the care is handed to them for free. </p>

		<p>My, oh my! How terrible! I feel soooo bad for them! Unfortunately, I have nothing more to give to help them, since I&rsquo;ve been taxed to the max already to pay for their welfare, food stamps, rent subsidies, free cell phones, babies out of wedlock, etc., etc., etc. I guess they&rsquo;ll just have to suffer all that pain with no help. I feel sooo bad for them! Tsk, tsk, tsk!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just a greedy white guy who&rsquo;s been working since he was 11 yrs. old (I&rsquo;m now 67 &amp; still at it.). It&rsquo;s too bad that the last working years of my life, I&rsquo;m watching one of these poor, deserving people run the country into oblivion with debt for even more welfare, food stamps, rent subsidies, mortgage help, etc., etc., etc. So I&rsquo;ll suffer my arthritis pains on my own. No one will give a damn or write articles about my, or other whites&rsquo; suffering, we&rsquo;ll just suffer. There won&rsquo;t be any money left for pain relief or disease relief for us. Soooo&hellip;. I guess I don&rsquo;t feel so bad about the poor blacks and hispanics (many of whom are here illegally) after all!</p>

		<p>This is just propaganda to get them more lifelong workmen&rsquo;s comp payments.</p>
<p>I fell off a ladder at work, landed on a concrete floor and broke both hips and 1 knee. I obviously am unable to work any more because my pelvis is held together by metal.</p>
<p>My employers insurance company follows the standard procedure of refusing any and all medical care and compensation.  I have to claim emotional damages rising from the physical injuries.  The emotional damages part of my case involves going to group therapy once a week.</p>
<p>6 to 12 people are in that group every week.  I am the only one who has any injuries that show up on xrays.  I am the only White person in the group.</p>
<p>The blacks and browns all claim vague back and shoulder pains that prevent them from working at any kind of job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure their claims will be settled long before mine will because they are blacks and browns with vague injuries that cannot be verified.</p>
<p>Winning a workmen&rsquo;s comp claim can be a bonanza.  Because I can never go back to work at any job whatsoever, I will sooner or later get back wages and the wages I would have earned had I been able to stay in the job for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>So I don&rsquo;t mind waiting.  I have separate income from rental property on which to live.  It will be bonanza for me.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel sorry for my employer.  I was fired from my job even before the ambulance came because I was injured.  Had they paid for 2 hip and 1 knee replacements and let me come back to work they would not now be facing several hundred thousand dollars in medical bills and paying me $3,000 per month for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>But going to that group therapy every week has opened my eyes to how the blacks and browns fake these vague pains that get them disability and workmen&rsquo;s compensation.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel a bit sorry for the companies that hire nothing but illegals and blacks.  Had they hired honest Whites, they would not be face with so many bogus workmen&rsquo;s comp claims.</p>

		<p> Whites struggle just as much with work pain, on the job injuries, having trouble paying bills, etc.  Blacks and hispanics and their liberal enablers are just making excuses for them and wanting pity for them instead of giving them a swift kick in the butt and telling them to suck it up.  This is just another way to push white guilt and transfer money and rights from whites to them.  That&rsquo;s all this nonsense is and let the anti-white people know that and that you&rsquo;re onto them.</p>

		<p>A lot of these people eat themselves into obesity, and then get arthritic knees, diabetes, etc.  For the most part these claims are just scams to get SSI and other goodies.  It&rsquo;s already been well documented.  SSI is the next step for long-term welfare recipients.  The welfare workers encourage it.  Now we throw in all of their &#8220;disabled&#8221; children.  Most of them are not disabled.  They haven&rsquo;t been brought up right and don&rsquo;t know how to behave in a civilized manner.  Or they&rsquo;re not very smart.  And now, they receive SSI too, just like mama, grandma, etc.  I think the psychiatric community has added a few new &#8220;conditions&#8221; to cover this.  </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just one more liability of these illegals.  They will have twice as many people on disability from arthritic conditions as whites.  Paying disability is a burden the rest of us have to share.  Couple this with much greater prison costs, food stamps, housing subsidies, medicaid, heating subsidies, a much lower tax base, a lower IQ in the information age, bilingual teachers, and brighter students being ignored, we can&rsquo;t ever again expect the prosterity that we used to know.  <br>
Does it matter if the disability is fake or real, it costs either way with this group.  It would be most interesting to see some stats on how many illegals get disability.  It seems the government never checks if these people lie on applications, and they know it.</p>
