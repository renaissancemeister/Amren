			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Kellogg, NPR, September 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Cherokee Nation recently decided to limit its membership to people who can prove they have Indian blood. This strips of their citizenship rights about 2,800 African-Americans who are descendants of slaves once owned by wealthy Cherokees. Those rights include access to health care clinics, food distribution for the poor, and assistance for low-income homeowners.</p>
<p>The move prompted protests among these African-Americans, who are known as Freedmen, because for long periods in the past, they enjoyed equal rights in the Cherokee tribe. But in more recent history, their citizenship rights have been repeatedly challenged.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Freedmen say they&rsquo;ve been kicked out of the Cherokee Nation by people who are no more Indian than they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of folks who are members of the tribe &hellip; have lived lives of white privilege,&#8221; says Marilyn Vann, who heads the Descendants of Freedman Association. She says many Cherokees are largely white and are &#8220;people who have never been discriminated against in their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Cherokee Nation&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruled in late August that the black Freedmen could be stripped of their citizenship because they can&rsquo;t prove they have Indian blood. {snip}</p>
<p>Cherokee leaders say it&rsquo;s not a matter of race, but a simple matter of narrowing the definition of Indian down to those people who can prove they have Indian blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a club; you can&rsquo;t just claim to be Cherokee and show up and be included,&#8221; says Cara Cowan Watts, a vocal member of the Cherokees&rsquo; tribal council.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Watts also points out that there are approximately 1,500 black citizens in the Cherokee Nation who have not lost their citizenship rights, because they are not just descended from Cherokee slaves but also from Indians.</p>
<p>It is a largely forgotten footnote of history that some wealthy Indians in the Deep South owned African slaves. {snip}</p>
<p>The Freedmen say the Nation&rsquo;s decision prevents more than 3,500 blacks from becoming Cherokee citizens, because their applications have never been processed. They claim tens of thousands of Freedmen exist and that many have been discouraged by historic discrimination and other barriers to citizenship blacks have faced, particularly in recent decades.</p>
<p>The Freedmen&rsquo;s estimates may be sound  &mdash;  many historians agree that at least 10 percent of all people on the Cherokee Trail of Tears were black. The vast majority were slaves, though some were runaways and intermarried, free blacks.</p>

<p>Invocating &#8220;White privilege&#8221; is the code word for &#8220;we have more work to do&#8221; at getting more stuff away from non blacks and giving it to blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;White privilege&#8221; is essentially a bill of attainder against &#8220;racists&#8221;.</p>
<p>We have our privileges (i.e. everything we own) because we are White, and Whites are racists, therefore, all our stuff came from our racist oppression of blacks, therefore, whoever takes it away from us is a hero of Civil and Human Rights.</p>
<p>Whenever someone mentions White Privilege, you can be sure that you are about to have some more of yours stolen or destroyed.</p>
<p>It is a perfect code word.  To argue against punishing Whiteys with Whitey Privilege is akin to saying &#8220;let the racists keep their stuff!&#8221;  Nobody can survive in society after saying that. </p>
<p>The Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of our government are now overtaken by radicals whose mission is to divest you of your White Privilege.   Those who shout White Privilege while pointing at you are just signaling to the government who is the next intended target of remedial social justice,<br>
 <br>

<p>&#8220;White elites in the Episcopal Church, still stigmatized by the historic shame of racism, barter with black elites for the next installment of public virtue.&#8221;</p>

<p>We agree!  Systems of Accountability can help us divest many of the Whitey Liberal Elites from a large measure of their unearned and horded White Privileges.  If we can&rsquo;t have our White Privileges, they why should they?  They shouldn&rsquo;t, so hurray for the Diversity Curse&rsquo;s powerful unburdening of Whitey Liberal Elites from what they&rsquo;ve misused and abused.  </p>
<p>If we ever needed Marc Lloyd to visit some over privileged Whiteys with the demand that they &#8220;step down to make room for persons of color,&#8221; we need him to visit Athens, Georgia, and help us get rid of the Very White Privileged Michael Adams.<br>

<p>That tells you right there why the Cherokee don&rsquo;t want them.  It&rsquo;s for the same reasons that White society has had enough of them.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The Freedmen&rsquo;s estimates <b>may</b> be sound &mdash; <b>many historians</b> agree that at least 10 percent of all people on the Cherokee Trail of Tears were black.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>And just who are these &#8220;many&#8221; historians who agree that the blacks&rsquo; estimates &#8220;may&#8221; be sound, and what is their evidence?  Given that this is NPR, don&rsquo;t expect an answer any time soon.  Once they&rsquo;ve left all the Guilty White Lefties with the impression that the Cherokee were ten percent black, their Marxist task is complete.<br>

<p>That says it all right there. I say good for the Cherokee! They have every right to keep what they have for themselves and not allow blacks to muscle in and  take the lion&rsquo;s share, as they do everywhere else.<br>
As for the black&rsquo;s wail of &#8220;The Indians have enjoyed White privilege&#8221; that is easy to refute, if any refutation in needed. Indian reservations have historically suffered extremely high rates of alcoholism, diabetes, tuberculosis, cholera, and other horrendous diseases long since nearly eliminated from white society. Blacks only add to this disparity with their lifestyles. The Indians don&rsquo;t want or need the blacks further dragging them down.  </p>

		<p>Stories such as this, where the two groups in conflict are &#8216;diverse&rsquo;, are very useful for inserting into casual conversations to see what kind of reaction you get. I would call it &#8216;racial fishing&rsquo;. Many of our civilians are intimidated when any expression of White racial solidarity is broached and will become defensive or hostile. By pointing out racial disputes outside of the White/fill-in-the-blank dichotomy, you can more easily discuss such problems without people getting heated. I have found that when I bring such a subject up while having a couple of drinks or eating dinner, the other parties will often break the taboo first. </p>

		<p> Typical of NPR to put the spin, &#8220;Poor blacks been treated unfairly   &mdash;   again&#8221; on this story. NPR never saw an alleged &#8220;victim&#8221; it didn&rsquo;t like. Especially if the &#8220;victim&#8221; has dark skin.</p>
<p> The Cherokee should have the right to decide who is a member of their tribe, and who is not. The fact that they&rsquo;ve accepted federal money over the years, however, puts them into the uncomfortable position many other organizations have faced: You accept the king&rsquo;s coin, you adhere to the king&rsquo;s whims. And this king always comes a-runnin&rsquo; when blacks scream &#8220;Discrimination!&#8221; Hopefully in the end the Cherokee will be able to hang in there and run their tribe the way they wish. </p>

		<p>Ah, American ethno-racial identity politics at its finest!</p>
<p>But, when are we going to start talking about Black-Privilege, I wonder? The privilege of having the entire government machinery working night and day to ensure that you succeed, whether you even wish to or not! The privilege of unlimitted entitlements, of special laws made to punish non-blacks, of the media who universally sing your praises despite your abhorrent behavior in all reality, of the broader entertainment-complex who labor incessantly to convince the non-black population that you are all such noble, benevolent, brilliant, industrious people as opposed to the violent, indolent, petulent primitives you generally are? </p>

		<p>I must be missing something here. Let&rsquo;s see, the Federal Government is threatening to withhold funds from the Cherokee nation which, of course, comes from our tax $$$, and which, of course, would eventually end up in the hands of non-Cherokee blacks who are Cherokee citizens because the Cherokee Nation had to atone for the unforgivable sin of having made these blacks slaves? And has anyone, anywhere, bothered to check to see if these &#8220;black&#8221; Cherokees are also claiming welfare benefits from the Federal Government as just blacks andnot as Cherokee citizens?</p>

		<p> First, my wife can claim tribal membership. As can my father-in- law and my children. Most people who look white and can claim tribal ancestry simply do so to honor their heritage. None of my family have identified themselves on a government forms as anything other than white. But they are unfailing proud of their heritage. If you look black but claim a Cherokee ancestor, you&rsquo;re a member of the Nation. If you can&rsquo;t, your not. I can&rsquo;t claim to be black, for the simple reason that I have no black ancestors. This is about money plain and simple. </p>

		<p>Typical of blacks.  They claim whites have never suffered, which is an ignorant and laughable statement to anyone with an IQ over 15 and who someone who isn&rsquo;t too lazy to research; they also view other people&rsquo;s successes  &mdash;  particularly whites  &mdash;  as the reason why they failed.  What kind of loser does someone have to be to think that way?  What would you think if there were an unsuccessful, lazy white person who blamed other people&rsquo;s happiness and success in life for why he failed?  Most of us would laugh at him and tell him to grow up.  Oh, no.  When it comes to blacks, many whites even won&rsquo;t say, &#8220;Grow up and take responsibility for your own lives.&#8221;  They&rsquo;ll be quiet and do whatever blacks want.  </p>
<p>People aren&rsquo;t biased against blacks simply because of their skin color.  People are really biased against blacks because many of them have bad attitudes, they are irresponsible parents on average to other races, many (young) blacks choose crime over being a good citizen and they want others to take care of them.  They feel entitled to what others have.  No, this isn&rsquo;t true of all, but it is true for many.  </p>

		<p>Cherokees are the new White privileged? I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it. I once heard a black charlatan quoted in the local fishwrap of liberal &#8220;idiotologies&#8221;, The Plain Dealer, claim that a &#8220;Chinese guy fresh off the boat in America has more rights than many of my peoples&#8221;. Is there a United Chinese College Fund? Is there a Yellow Entertainment Television? Is there a Chinese Shield for Chinese/East Asian firefighters? Is there an Urban Chinese League? Is there an NAACP? National Advancement Agency for Chinese People? Is there a race baiting Chinese equivalent to Al Not-So-Sharpton? I could go on forever.</p>
<p>Now will there be a large Cherokee flash mob that I&rsquo;ll have to watch out for? If so I may be at an advantage if they only have bows &amp; arrows. Maybe not. Those warriors used those things with great precision. Just like black leaders using White privilege with great dexterity into the hearts of naive lefties everywhere. I&rsquo;m not falling for it. I am a happily reformed non-liberal. </p>

		<p>16-Istvan: &#8220;Why not give blacks their own reservation?&#8221; - Yes, sort of. I believe we should have racial separation, but a &#8220;reservation&#8221; such as Lesotho in South Africa or what Whites cut out for the Indians in America will not work. For those who aren&rsquo;t quite there yet, - America is gone. We are living in the middle phase of the destruction of our nation that began with the importation of non-Whites even before America became a nation, and which has now greatly accelerated since the 1965 immigration act.  That we had 200+ years of expansion on a relatively safe land mass has indeed been a blessing, but that has come to an end.  No nation survives the ethnic mixing in which we now find ourselves, and only through White-flight have we been able to put off the worst of conflicts. Greater conflict will come, with the result being ethno-states. Which race will end up with what part of the land mass of North America is the question that will be answered.  I think we could make such a separation and have it done peacefully, but I doubt that will occur.  My bet is that anti-White sentiment and greed will push us all to mass bloodshed before it gets worked out. </p>

		<p><i>So the Cherokee are white now? I always said that if whites disappeared, East Asians would replace whites as the new black &ldquo;oppressors&rdquo;. The idiots would be talking about &ldquo;yellow skin privilege&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;white skin privilege.&rdquo; You can&rsquo;t win with people who have persecution paranoia. The Cherokee are now among America&rsquo;s privileged?</i></p>
<p>Ironically, the average Cherokee seems to be whiter than the average Mexican. So I&rsquo;d say: yes, rather.</p>

		<p>Only Whites are not allowed to racially discriminate as a matter of self interest, and this self inflicted. Why? Because Whites are saps in a sickening way no other race or ethnic group would dream of being.</p>
