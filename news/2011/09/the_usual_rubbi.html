			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s probably what a great many think about advertisements for public sector jobs.</p>
<p>But the words &#8216;the usual rubbish about equal opportunities&rsquo; were clearly not supposed to be published.</p>
<p>A Liverpool hospital trust has begun an inquiry after the phrase was accidentally published on its website.</p>
<p>The advert by the Royal Liverpool &amp; Broadgreen University Hospital NHS Trust invited applications for a trainee anaesthetist.</p>
<p>But the familiar provision about equal opportunities that usually appears at the bottom of such adverts was replaced by the rather embarrassing &#8216;usual rubbish&rsquo; phrase.</p>
<p>The blunder prompted a flurry of comments on Twitter about the importance of proof-reading and some called the mistake &#8216;hilarious&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The advertisement has since been updated to remove the statement.</p>
<p>It is believed to have been spotted by a doctor who saw it when he was looking to apply for the position. </p>
<p>The advert, published last Thursday, was for a one-year post as a fellow in anaesthesia, working alongside consultants at the two Liverpool hospitals.</p>
<p>A trust spokesman said no one had been identified in connection with the mistake yet and confirmed the advert had been uploaded internally.</p>
<p>The spokesman said: &#8216;The wording on this advert in no way reflects the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust&rsquo;s position in relation to equal opportunities, to which it is fully committed.</p>
<p>&#8216;The trust is conscious of its duty to promote equality. The trust will be conducting an investigation into this incident to ensure that this cannot happen again.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>That is funny. Some manager let a naive literalist subordinate type the ad.</p>

		<p>In Washington, a &#8220;gaffe&#8221; is when someone accidentally tells the truth.  It appears this principle holds true in the UK as well.  Of course, the offending party pulled the ad.   </p>

		<p>I think it <i>was</i> a blunder. I don&rsquo;t think someone was making a political statement, simply because the penalties are so stiff for saying this kind of thing, especially in the UK. Heads are going to roll because of this!!!</p>

		<p>During &#8216;reconstruction&rsquo; in the US I believe an equal-opportunity advertisement read that a job was open to applicants, &#8216;regardless of race or previous condition of servitude&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Now THAT is what I call truth in advertising!</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t a prank. Some supervisor passed the ad off to a secretary to publish. And the secretary published it verbatim rather than filling in the blanks with the standard equal opportunity &#8220;rubbish&#8221;. That just goes to show that everyone knows this equal opportunity stuff is &#8220;rubbish&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Pretty sure it was incompetence.  Where I live and do business I am constantly overwhelmed by how much people care, how they want to meet every need, to earn my business, to really show they care&hellip;they are still incompetent, usually failing in some respect, however, they sure do care.</p>
<p>You need surgery, do you want a caring, hugging surgeon, someone who cares and cries with you, yet is incompetent&hellip;or do you want someone who is solid and competent?  Not rude but not huggy.</p>
