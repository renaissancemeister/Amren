<p>Bah!</p>
<p>As Washington twists itself into a pretzel with convoluted plots and plans to &#8220;create jobs&#8221;, as usual they miss the forest for the trees. As we have always pointed out, the most obvious solution to many of our financial woes is a simple one: deal with illegal immigration. And with jobs it is no exception. For every illegal with a job there is an American without one.</p>
<p>Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) gets it. He has a &#8220;surefire&#8221; plan to create jobs in America. And unlike Obama, he doesn&rsquo;t need 40 minutes to explain it.</p>

		<p>Rep. Brooks, can we interest you in becoming Governor of Texas? Wish it were possible. We&rsquo;re drowning in illegals here. Our RINO governor, if he makes it to the White House, will welcome every illegal in sight. His big contributors need the cheap labor and he needs the votes of the pro-illegal supporters.</p>

		<p>Not just illegals.  A lot of legal immigrants on legal immigrant H-xB or J-x visas need to have their visas revoked and their persons deported, too.  What little job growth there has been since the start of our near-depression has gone almost entirely to legal or illegal aliens.  A lot of native born whites have lost jobs to legal or illegal aliens.</p>

		<p>Besides this accurate piece of advise on job creation, the real point is that these people are in violation of U.S. Immigration law, which either means something or doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

		<p>The article claims: &#8220;For every illegal with a job there is an American without one.&#8221; </p>
<p>While I favor expulsion of illegal aliens, elimination of birthright citizenship, and an end to all third world immigration, legal or illegal, I do not think that this is a good argument in support of those goals, and I would not use it. </p>
<p>This simplistic argument treats &#8220;jobs&#8221; as a commodity, of which there are just so many and no more, which must be divided up among &#8220;workers,&#8221; one job per worker. But this makes no sense. Not all workers can or will do all kinds of work. The performance of one job may stimulate the creation of others. It&rsquo;s not about &#8220;jobs,&#8221; whatever those might be, it&rsquo;s about wealth creation, and when a man does work that creates wealth, he benefits all, and this is independent of what paperwork he might or might not have done at the border. </p>
<p>So do I believe that illegal immigration is beneficial? That illegals do jobs that Americans don&rsquo;t want, freeing Americans to do the jobs that they do want? Not at all. I think that illegals harmfully drive down the cost of labor until American workers, who demand and deserve reasonable pay and working conditions, cannot compete for entry-level work which they would otherwise do. </p>
<p>There are plenty of good arguments against third world immigration, whether legal or illegal, having to do with cultural and racial displacement, welfare dependency and government benefits, or crime. This argument gets us nowhere, as does the similarly simplistic argument that refers to the number of dollars which illegal aliens send back to their home countries every year as if this were somehow harmful. <br>

		<p>Expelling foreign alien immigrants would force a lot of businesses to either raise wages or suspend their operations.</p>
<p>This would be a healthy thing for the restaurant and landscaping business, of which their are too many operators competing for the bottom dollar using the cheapest labor possible.</p>

		<p>If illegal aliens are granted amnesty, they will be de jure &#8220;Americans&#8221; and will have no need to &#8220;do work that Americans won&rsquo;t do.&#8221; Thus, there will be a market for more illegal aliens, and the 20 year cycle will begin again&hellip;.</p>
<p>Businesses, both large &amp; small, profit by employing illegals. Yet &#8220;businessmen&#8221; are thought to be &#8220;conservative.&#8221; They&rsquo;re selling out our nation for a buck. But then so are all of the rest of us. </p>
<p>In the SF Bay Area, I have yet to see an all white residential construction crew in over a DECADE! The vast majority of time, it is a white contractor (who&rsquo;s pick up often has an American flag), w/Latino workers   &mdash;   better profit margins for the contractor. What white hypocrites! </p>
<p>Look at gardeners. You NEVER see Asian gardeners anymore, unless they&rsquo;re the owner. The workers are all Latinos. Look at maid service, nannies/baby sitters, and fast food workers too. All Latinos because they&rsquo;re a LOT cheaper than whites and you&rsquo;re less afraid they&rsquo;ll commit a crime against you than blacks (virtually all of whom have a perpetual chip on their shoulders against whites). </p>
<p>As Rushdoony said so many years ago, until we all get the larceny out of our hearts, America won&rsquo;t improve. </p>
<p>Stopping illegal immigration and deporting the illegals here is in all of our national interest even if it is in few of our individual interest. That is why public policy must step in to fix this problem because the free market won&rsquo;t. We all must &#8220;bite the bullet&#8221; slightly to save our country.</p>

<p>Of course you&rsquo;re right Mick, but first we need to get an actual Republican in the White House (not a RINO) who would be willing to sign a bill dealing with illegal invaders if it were to ever be passed. </p>
<p>George Bush spent the last two years of his presidency campaigning for amnesty on half of illegal invaders. He sounded just like Obama does now&hellip;.<br>

<p>I respectfully disagree.  This is a very powerful argument precisely because it is so simple and because, at its root, it is essentially correct.  There may not be an exactly demonstrable 1:1 ratio that can be shown, but the basic premise that illegal aliens take jobs that working class Americans would otherwise be doing is correct.</p>
<p>The logical extension to this argument, once illegal immigration has been effectively neutralized, is to then say we need to severely limit legal immigration as well for the same reason - there are plenty of unemployed Americans whose jobs were taken by the H1B crowd.  I grant that it lacks the nuance of other arguments, but that&rsquo;s not its purpose.</p>
<p>The other benefit to it is that America is going to be bleeding jobs for a very long time because every job that can be shipped overseas has been and will continue to be, at least until we manage to get all this craziness reversed. </p>

		<p>According to Nancy Pelosi there are 20,000,000 illegals in the US.  she should know.  Only 2% work in agriculture.  Think about it.  My family were farmers and they never had to use hispanics for anything.  locally teens and women used to pick the orchards for extra money until hispanics made it too dangerous for them to do the work.  machines now can be used to pick fruit trees.  Its all hype we never did need the hispanics.  Eisenhower sent them back if you recall and we did very nicely without them</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m retired, so I don&rsquo;t need to worry about jobs. They don&rsquo;t affect me.  (Naturally, I sympathize with those who are unemployed.)</p>
<p>But the issue for me is about demographics and culture, not economics. There is too much talk about jobs, as if that&rsquo;s all there is.  We are seeing our country transformed before our eyes. We are becoming a Third World nation.   We hear Spanish everywhere. We see faces we can&rsquo;t identify with.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if there is FULL employment and jobs galore. I STILL don&rsquo;t want them here anyway! Let them stay in their own countries where they belong. We need to have a country of our own.</p>

		<p>The jobs problem is bound to cause an eventual anti-illegal reaction among blacks, who are now too stolidly backing their black Prez.  This reaction will extend also to legal Hispanics if the latter appear to stand with the illegals.  The black/brown coalition dream of the Dems is a pipe dream.<br>

		<p>This sounds like election year talk to me&hellip;  Poof, gone as soon as the person returns to office. However, I do agree that several million American&rsquo;s would return to work if the illegals were removed. Just as importantly, in many fields that illegals are prominent the working conditions, safety, compensation, and ultimately public safely would vastly improve. We just have to be willing to accept that the price we pay for produce, and in particular for meat will go up. This will be offset by the amount paid out in public benefits, but its unrealistic to ever expect the reduction there to trickle down to us any time soon, or for politicians not to spend the money on something else that offers little benefit to the white population. </p>
<p>There are a few fields that it is just bloody hard to recruit people for; much of this is due to the pay, conditions, work itself, and the location of these jobs. Its not that you can&rsquo;t get white people out into the fields to pick, and lug pumpkins, but it is not exactly a career. The timing of when certain crops come in prevents many young people from taking these jobs. </p>

		<p>How to improve the job and economy situation:</p>
<p>1) stop ALL immigration, illegal and legal.<br>
2) start removing illegal&rsquo;s, many will self-deport if we get serious about locking up the ones we catch, including the ones with &#8220;US&#8221; citizen children, they can take them with them.<br>
3) stop all citizenship proceedings.<br>
4) start removing all green card holders from the US (this could be done on a graduated basis based on how long they have been legal residents).<br>
5) make it illegal for any foreign born individual (citizen or not) to hold any federal, state or local government job.  Do we really need nigerian court employees, chinese postal clerks, or costa rican DMV workers?  This could also be done on a graduated basis depending on length of service, probably with a buy out at termination if they leave their employment on a positive basis (AKA don&rsquo;t screw us just before going).<br>
6) removing all foreign born individuals from our military.<br>
7) removing all the children of foreign born individuals from our military.  (Any shortage in troops can be made up by closing down the bulk of our 900 overseas occupational bases).<br>
8) removing all muslims from our military.<br>
9) eliminating all welfare for able bodied adults, including unwed mothers, she can get a job, get baby daddy to support her, or some combination of the above.  This would force the willing unemployed into jobs.<br>
10) after the above is done we should start revoking the citizenship of the children of illegal alien children and considering revoking the citizenship of naturalized citizen.<br>
11) institute martial law so they those who protest new immigration or citizenship laws would be subject to arrest and if violent police would be authorized to use deadly force.</p>
<p>Foreign nations who don&rsquo;t like this, well we still have a nuclear arsenal so I am not too worried about their protests.  We should also start drilling for oil, gas and better utilizing our coal reserves to help us with any disruption in the import markets.  We also have the food export business to hold over the heads of our enemies.</p>
<p>This would create tons of jobs for Americans of all skill levels from the most illiterate to the unemployed over 40 white, male professionals.</p>
<p>Am I foolish enough to believe the above could be instituted all at once, of course not, it would have to be done in stages.  Starting with the illegals, military and closing of the borders.  Would it be messy, in the beginning yes, until it becomes we are serious about retaking most if not all of our nation.  Would many whites be harmed, yes, especially the race traitors who join up with the invaders, but if we pulled together the means would justify the ends.  Remember, the 49 continental states have the ability to be pretty self-reliant from a natural resource level.  And with a smaller population we would need less energy imports.  Fewer overseas bases would save money.  Eliminating SSI for all of our South Asian immigrant&rsquo;s desiccated parents and the children of Latin Americans diagnosed as &ldquo;learning disabled&rdquo; would save a fortune.<br>

		<p>Legal Immigration-The Bigger Problem..Edwin S. Rubenstein, vdare.com, July 31, 2007</p>
<p>Everyone is against illegal immigration (they say). Problem: legal immigration is actually the bigger problem.</p>
<p>How many legal immigrants enter the U.S. each year? Let me count the ways they come in! (With apologies to the poet.)</p>
<p>The 1990 immigration law &#8220;capped&#8221; legal immigration at 700,000 persons a year. Yet since 1990, there&rsquo;ve been only two years in which legal immigration has been below that level. </p>
<p>In 2006, 1,266,264 people were granted legal permanent resident status. That&rsquo;s a record if you exclude the post-IRCA amnesty spike of the early 1990s &mdash; which reflected the 1986 amnestying of illegal aliens already here. </p>
<p>In contrast, the stock of illegals in the US is growing by an estimated 500,000/year. [The Size and Characteristics of the Unauthorized Migrant Population in the U.S., by Jeffrey S. Passel, Pew Hispanic Center, 2006. PDF] </p>
<p>There are about 26 million legal immigrants in the country. Notoriously, the U.S. government doesn&rsquo;t know how many illegals are here. The official estimate is 12 million, but it could be as high as 20 million. This is certainly a scandalous situation. But, either way, there are still more legal immigrants &mdash; and their numbers are growing faster.</p>
<p>Why doesn&rsquo;t the 1990 &#8220;cap&#8221; on legal immigration work? Because it exempts &#8220;immediate family&#8221; of U.S. citizens. Current immigration law allows both naturalized and U.S.–born citizens to bring in their spouses, children and parents without limit &mdash; a never-ending chain. Legal residents, (i.e. Green Card holders) may have to wait several years before bringing their families to America (legally). But of course, once they&rsquo;re here, they&rsquo;re here. </p>
<p>The &#8220;immediate family&#8221; loophole accounted for 580,483 immigrants in 2006, slightly less than half of all legal immigrants admitted that year. Over the past decade it has been the largest category of legal immigrant admissions. (See Table 1).</p>
<p>About half of all legal immigrants were already in the country prior to becoming a &#8220;legal immigrant&#8221; through various maneuvers. </p>
<p>One way in which this can happen arises out of the current misinterpretation of the &#8220;citizen child&#8221; clause of the 14th Amendment. A child born to an illegal alien in the U.S. is automatically a U.S. citizen &mdash; an &#8220;anchor baby.&#8221; In the present climate, this means the parents are hard to deport as a practical matter &mdash; and the child will be able petition his parents into U.S. legally when he reaches 18. (An estimated 300,000 &#8220;anchor babies&#8221; are born in California each year.). </p>
<p>Or an illegal alien can marry a U.S. citizen. (An Asian marriage ring was recently broken up by the ICE &mdash; one woman, Julie Tran pled guilty to being involved in &#8220;as many as 75 sham marriages,&#8221; a scam to get green cards for both local and overseas clients.) </p>
<p>Refugees are another category exempt from the worldwide limit. A refugee is defined as &#8220;an alien outside the United States who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well founded fear of persecution.&#8221; </p>
<p>A sister category &mdash; asylee &mdash; refers to such people who have somehow already gotten into the U.S. </p>
<p>Any Somali or Hmong or can show up at a Catholic Charity intake office in Mogadishu or Bangkok and be processed as a refugee. </p>
<p>The refugee and asylee categories are just another form of expedited immigration. As Peter Brimelow points out in Alien Nation, (Page 82) more than 80% of refugees have relatives already here &mdash; something that would be impossible if these individuals had truly been selected at random from disenfranchised peoples.</p>
<p>216,454 refugees and asylees were admitted in 2006.</p>
<p>The &#8220;diversity lottery&#8221; is another end-run around immigration laws. It allows millions of people around the world to send in an electronic lottery number from which 50,000 winners are picked each year. </p>
<p>Since no ties to relatives in the U.S. are required, the program was supposed to allow a more geographically diverse group of people to obtain permanent resident status. </p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t worked. Most the winning lottery tickets are eventually disqualified because of fraud &mdash; many individuals sending in multiple entries under different aliases. And the winners are disproportionately from the Muslim world &mdash; with several implicated in terrorism in the United States.</p>
<p>And then there are legal &#8220;non-immigrants,&#8221; a group that includes H-1Bs who are admitted because their (allegedly) high-tech skills are (allegedly) in short supply. H-1Bs are capped at 65,000. But a whopping 407,418 were actually admitted in 2006. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the &#8220;cap&#8221; pertains only to persons working in the private sector. Universities and non-profits can apply for an unlimited number of H-1Bs &mdash; even though most of these &#8220;exempt&#8221; H-1bs eventually get green cards and become naturalized citizens.</p>
<p>Another guest worker program, the H-2B, admits persons who &#8220;perform services unavailable in the U.S.&#8221; They&rsquo;re mainly seasonal workers in tourist areas and construction sites. This program is also &#8220;capped&#8221; 66,000 per year. But &mdash; as with its H-1B cousin &mdash; the cap exempts students and individuals working for non-profits. 87,000 H-2Bs were admitted in 2004, the latest year of available data. </p>
<p>And in case you&rsquo;re wondering, the anchor baby loophole applies to guest workers also. H-1Bs and H-2Bs are allowed to bring in spouses (and children). These are not counted towards the &#8220;cap.&#8221; And, as with illegal aliens, a baby born here means they are hard to deport and can ultimately be sponsored in by their citizen child.</p>
<p>The legal immigration problem has dropped off America&rsquo;s radar screen &mdash; displaced by the undeniable crisis over illegals. </p>
<p>But legal immigration is larger, growing faster, potentially more disruptive &mdash; and, because it is set by inflexible statute, just as much out of control. </p>

		<p>You could turn the tide of immigration laws in this country if you could manage to slip one simple bill through Congress: A bill mandating that any immigrant with a college law degree from any third world country was automatically a member of any US Bar.  Every lawyer would immediately be against immigration.  </p>

		<p>Justice Department:Gibson Should Just Move to Madagascar&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Aug 31st, 2011 | By R. Mitchell | Category: Politics</p>
<p></p>
<p>The continuing saga of Obama&rsquo;s Dept. of Justice going after American guitar maker Gibson just got even more incredulous. Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz was interviewed by KJMN&rsquo;s Chris Daniel today and mentioned that the agents stealing materials from his factory told him, no wrote down that if he&rsquo;d move his labor force to Madagascar, this wouldn&rsquo;t be an issue. You can hear the entire interview, but here&rsquo;s where the interview took a turn. Chris Daniel asked Henry if the government told him to relocate to a foreign country, he replied, &ldquo; They actually wrote that in a pleading.&rdquo;<br>
 </p>
<p>Chris:  That your problems would uh,  go away if you used Madagascar labor instead of our labor?<br>
 <br>
Mr. Juszkieicz:  Yes<br>
 <br>
Between this, the Boeing NLRB mess, the Department of Justice blocking of AT&T;&rsquo;s effort to bring back 5,000 jobs from other countries, it is becoming more obvious that the administration has no clue how to create jobs, foster business growth or bring America back to growth.<br>
 <br>
Despite Gibson playing the environmentalist game, they are being singled-out. They follow the rules of the Forest Stewardship Council, they consult with environmentalist groups like Green Peace and still .. STILL the government goes after them. The government of Madagascar has signed affidavits that Gibson has complied with their laws and the Obama administration then decides that Madagascar is not a real government .. but still tries to enforce their laws.<br>
 <br>
What&rsquo;s even worse is that in the same interview, Gibson&rsquo;s CEO relays that the Obama administration does not even recognize the government of Madagascar, but is somehow interpreting their laws differently than they do. You&rsquo;ll have to listen to the audio to believe the inane behavior of Eric Holder, the Dept. of Justice and the rest of the Obama administration.<br>
 <br>
This is exactly how you kill jobs – American jobs – and send them overseas.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a &#8220;Republican&#8221; and I&rsquo;m not &#8220;excusing&#8221; anything and I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to Hannity or Rush if my life depended on it! They could care less about the massive, third-world illegal invasion being inflicted upon us. I&rsquo;ve been fighting this battle for a number of years, and they are all traitors as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. </p>
<p>With that being said, how do we get someone in office who is going to not only address, but stop this illegal invasion post haste! </p>
<p>Quite frankly, I&rsquo;m of the opinion both political parties have no desire to stop illegal invaders and I have little hope the next president ( regardless of party)  is going to stop this invasion. </p>
