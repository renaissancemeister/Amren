<h1><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2011/09/21/world/americas/mexico-bodies/index.html?hpt=hp_t2">Police May Have Clues About 35 Bodies Found in Mexican Roadway</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Investigators say they have a video that may hold clues to how unidentified men managed to drive two open-back trucks filled with 35 bodies through rush-hour traffic and then abandon them, blocking traffic and leaving bodies on the highway.</p>
<p>Police in the east coast state of Veracruz found the abandoned trucks and the bodies near a shopping mall in the municipality of Boca del Rio on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Photos of the scene showed the two trucks  &mdash;  with tall, open-slat sides, like for carrying produce or animals  &mdash;  with their back gates open, the bodies literally falling out onto the street. People on a nearby overpass looked down on shirtless bodies piled on top of each other.</p>
<p>Drug violence is not unheard of in Veracruz, a Zetas cartel stronghold, but a killing of this magnitude shocked even the hardened Mexicans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The dead included 12 women and 23 men.</p>
<p>The video may show that the two trucks were guarded by other cars that could have doubled as getaway vehicles, Veracruz Attorney General Reynaldo Escobar Perez said Wednesday in a radio interview. He did not say where the video came from.</p>
<p>Investigators also are looking into whether police colluded with the people who discarded the bodies, he told W Radio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In another interview, the attorney general said that the victims died of suffocation. Only one had a bullet wound, he said. The state of the bodies led investigators to deduce they died shortly before being abandoned, Escobar Perez said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two trucks were abandoned in the middle of the highway, witnesses said. Their gates were open and bodies had fallen out.</p>
<p>Hours later, bloodstains remained on the road as troops stood guard.</p>
<p>Boca del Rio is in Veracruz state&rsquo;s most populated area. It has become a frequent site of clashes between armed groups as drug-related violence grows.</p>

		<p>Well I don&rsquo;t know about anyone else, but stories like these do little to increase my &#8220;tolerance&#8221; or my desire for &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m afraid of the crappy country that is being left for my children.  So I don&rsquo;t regret teaching my kids that their European heritage makes them special and that they should be proud of being white.  And if whites are &#8220;haters&#8221; or if they end up being &#8220;haters&#8221; then so be it.  Who wouldn&rsquo;t be with this type of doubletalking, doublethinking speech and media?  I don&rsquo;t mind saying it outright, that I could officially be disignated a &#8220;racist&#8221; if it means I don&rsquo;t want my country to turn into one that normalizes and accepts this craziness. At least if whites do end up with self-love that somehow ends up being called &#8220;hate&#8221;, they must have internalized a reason to do so.  And that&rsquo;s better than NOT knowing who you are.</p>

		<p>  The social chaos and mayhem of the Mexican drug gang culture seems to get worse by the hour.  It is only a matter of time before dead bodies are dumped in the main street of some city of the formerly Anglo American Southwest. This is what our greedy utopian dreaming elites wanted and I hope they are the first ones affected by it.</p>

		<p>They probably will be seriously impacted by it, Sardonicus.  Since kidnapping for ransom has reached epidemic levels in Mexico, with wealthy families forming the main targets, our own traitorous plutocrat elites will likely attract the same sort of attention from kidnappers in the impending ex-US southwest.  Sure, they often live in gated communities, but they have to leave those to shop, work, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping the liberal Hollyweirdos are the first set of victims.</p>

		<p>In contrast to other Mexican states, Veracruz did not (until recently) experience anything like this. Some reports indicate that virtually all of these people who were murdered had some ties to or connections with organized crime and that they were not your everyday (honest) citizens.  Unfortunately, the drug trade and organized crime have become so pervasive throughout Mexico and other Latin American countries that even innocent people can and do become victims  &mdash;  and it&rsquo;s not just happening in Mexico, either. Case in point: The Univision network&rsquo;s weekly current events magazine &#8220;Aqui Y Ahora&#8221; (&#8220;Here And Now&#8221;) aired a special at some point in the early Summer of 2011 about how drug-related violent crimes and even drug-related kidnappings have been steadily increasing in Puerto Rico recently. </p>

<p> I totally agree. Twenty years in the military, protecting all other countries from aggression and our &#8220;dear leaders&#8221; allow the country to be overrun by these people. I find it disgusting.</p>
