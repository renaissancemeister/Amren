<h1><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/18/harsher-flash-mob-penalties-weighed-in-maryland/">Harsher Flash-Mob Penalties Weighed in Maryland</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Hill, The Washington Times, September 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Maryland lawmaker is considering legislation in next year&rsquo;s General Assembly to strengthen penalties related to flash-mob robberies.</p>
<p>Delegate Jeffrey D. Waldstreicher, Montgomery Democrat, said he might sponsor a bill that would hold each flash-mob participant responsible for the total amount of merchandise stolen by the group, rather than just for their own actions.</p>
<p>Montgomery officials first encountered the problem last month when roughly 30 young people returning from the county fair entered a 7-Eleven in Germantown en masse and stole merchandise.</p>
<p>If the bill becomes law, anybody who steals $10 in merchandise as part of a $1,000 mass robbery could be charged with stealing all $1,000 worth of items.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Maryland, theft of less than $100 is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum 90 days in jail, while theft of $100 to $1,000 is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum 18 months in prison and $1,000 fine.</p>
<p>Theft of more than $1,000 is a felony punishable by a maximum 15 years in prison and $25,000 fine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Flash mobs have become a growing problem in Philadelphia, where teens have in some cases gathered by the hundreds to harass and assault bystanders. Similar incidents have occurred this year in Chicago, Milwaukee, Wis., and the District  &mdash;  where in April about 20 teens robbed a Dupont Circle clothing store of about $20,000 in merchandise.</p>

		<p>It will never happen.  The White Elites will never allow blacks to suffer punishment in proportion to their &#8220;regrettable acting out based on historic injustices and Internalized Racist Oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites must never be allowed to get the message the blacks ever really deserve punishment for anything they do that destroys White Civilization.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Troy Davis agitators are so worked up and demanding he be saved. Killing a White policeman shouldn&rsquo;t be considered all that bad.</p>

		<p>I can believe the politicians will probably pass harsher penalties for flash mobs, in order to look good.  I can believe that Governor Walter O&rsquo;Mexico will sign such a bill, to look good.  </p>
<p>I can believe that the State&rsquo;s Attorneys in counties with enough black people will refuse to file charges based on these new laws.</p>

		<p>Our politicians always seem to think they need to pass a new law for something. Flash mobs are rioting and looting and should be prosecuted as such.</p>

Funny you should mention this, the parole board today refused to intervene so unless some politician steps in before tomorrow night, 9/21/11, at 12:00 midnight he will put down.</p>
<p>A little backstory on this case, I am a lifelong resident of Savannah, GA. where the crime took place and was also a jailer at the time at Chatham County Detention Center where he was held til his verdict.</p>
<p>Whether or not the murdered officer (Mark MacPhail) had been trying to quell a violent situation with nonviolence we will never know but he approached Troy Davis with a nightstick and didn&rsquo;t pull his weapon but he was killed execution style none the less.</p>
<p>I was a jailer in the newly added section of the institution where he was being held and witnessed him reveling in the celebrity of being a &#8220;copkiller&#8221; because at the time it was very common for most rap groups to have songs on their albums dedicated to killing cops so he was lavished with praise, soft drinks, candy and other goodies for having done so.</p>
<p>At no time did I ever hear him claim not guilty to his fans nor did any of the other jailers assigned to his sector, rather he played &#8220;B Ball&#8221; and wore a constant smirk on his face.</p>
<p>I bet he never even considered this day would come.</p>

		<p>The nationwide &#8220;flash mob&#8221; of the 2012 election is going to make this moot. <br/>
Get home safe, and stay inside after you vote! If you live in a black- dominant area, consider a vacation!</p>

		<p>It seems to me that prosecutors could have already charged each mob member with every felony that occurs during the robberies.  All they have to do is demonstrate that the criminals are all working toward the same goal, just as a gang of bank robbers does.  In all felonies regarding theft, if someone is injured or murdered, the whole group takes the rap.<br/>
This announcement is probably just publicity trying to reassure the public and/or caution flash mob participants.  Most ghetto blacks can&rsquo;t think far enough ahead to consider the legal ramifications of participating in mob robberies.  They might, however, consider the prospect of cops shooting them in the streets.</p>

		<p>The Maryland bill is a nice gesture, but even if it passes   &mdash;   and &#8220;civil rights&#8221; leaders will pull out the stops to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t   &mdash;   such a law will amount to symbolism and little else.  Given the nature of the merchandise at a 7-Eleven or Tiger Mart, this must be the outcome.  Does anyone think some homey is going to be dissuaded from partaking in a mob because he&rsquo;s now liable for all missing packages of Twinkies or Pop Tarts, and not just the ones he personally lifted?  </p>
<p>In any event, the ulterior motive of flash mobs is not to steal, it&rsquo;s to terrorize.  The mobs love the feeling of causing a hapless (and preferably white) store clerk to quiver with fear and helplessness.  A group of two dozen blacks walking single file through a retail outlet serves its purpose simply by its existence.  No, the only real deterrent to these flash mobs is for store clerks to tap into their inner Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood, pull out a pistol, and use it. </p>

		<p>I would NEVER believe a politician from Maryland. The liberals rule Montgomery County and they openly work against the interests of Whites.  They will never do anything to enforce laws that represent White values.</p>

		<p>Beware of new laws. Not every occasion requires a new law. How about enforcing the laws we have already?</p>
<p>The phenomenon of flash mob robberies and shakedowns does not require new laws to curtail it. It is already a violation of existing laws. What is needed is law enforcement and possibly new investigative tools to identify the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Remember   &mdash;   new laws are prone to prosecutorial abuse as prosecutors try to stretch their application beyond their original intention.</p>
<p>Street shakedowns are not new.</p>

		<p>We don&rsquo;t need more laws to deal with this.  We especially don&rsquo;t need politicians to protect us in our homes and places of business.  What needs to happen is for these little thugs to get met with strong reaction when they pull these stunts.  These little animals have no fear of new laws.  The solution to this problem is to make them afraid to pull this crap.</p>

		<p>This is already done in many jurisdictions.  In federal fraud cases, each member of a set of co-defendants is individually responsible for making the restitution complete.  If one perp gets out of prison before the others and completes the restitution before any of his co-defendants are released, all he can do is sue them in civil court.  If they don&rsquo;t have the money, he&rsquo;s stuck like Chuck with a worthless court judgement.</p>
<p>One bright point is that a lot of the perpetrators in these mob attacks are under 18.  In most states, the parents are liable for damages resulting from any deliberate misconduct on the part of their minor children.  If courts start sticking the parents with huge bills for damages, some of these brats may get a little less enthusiastic about theft and robbery.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed however that these incidents are not happening in &#8220;shall issue&#8221; concealed carry states; apparently these vicious punks prefer unarmed victims for their mass robberies and assaults.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t understand.  Under the common law, each conspirator is already liable for the actions of his co-conspirators.</p>
