<h1>NJ Celebrates Hispanic Heritage Statewide</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chron, September 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Jersey is celebrating Hispanic heritage with events all over the state.</p>
<p>Gov. Chris Christie recently signed a proclamation marking the period between Sept. 15 and Oct. 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month. He says it&rsquo;s a time to celebrate and highlight the many contributions that New Jersey&rsquo;s Hispanic community makes to the state.</p>
<p>The most recent Census figures show Hispanics now account for the largest minority group in New Jersey and more than 17 percent of the overall population.</p>
<p>The number of Hispanics in New Jersey has seen a near 40 percent increase over the past decade.</p>

		<p>Christie is just another feckless RINO who doesn&rsquo;t understand that Republicans will NEVER get a majority of the Hispanic vote. Why won&rsquo;t they? Because the proportion of Hispanics who drop out of school, live in poverty, score poorly on IQ tests, have out of wedlock children, etc. is persistantly and substantially higher than that of whites. As a result most will eschew the limited government mantra of Republicans. They are an ideal group for socialits err, I mean Democrats. </p>

		<p>As long as our elected leaders put the welcome mat out for people who don&rsquo;t belong here, who shower them with goodies, who bring baby gifts for their &#8220;anchor&#8221; babies, who give them jobs, and in every way subvert our laws, they will continue to come. The Republican wannabee all want the border secured - big deal - everyone does, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. How about standing up for this country and its unemployed people by mandating e-verify, stop all goodies, eliminate birthright citizenship and get the military on the border. Then, we&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re serious!</p>

		<p>I used to live in Hudson County, NJ. In the early 60&rsquo;s, my town&rsquo;s mayor thought it would be a fine idea to put out the welcome mat for thousands of canecutter refugees from Florida. His real goal was to skim part of the Federal funds that would follow them.</p>
<p>When questioned on why he wanted the character of the town to change, he said the town was dying and we needed these &#8220;industrious immigrants&#8221; to revitalize it.&#8221; </p>
<p>In short order, the town turned into a Third World barrio and eventually all the English-speaking town politicians were voted out, to be replaced with Hispanic ones. Our crooked mayor never got to see the last part, as he ended up in the Federal pen.</p>
<p>This was the first time that I got to see a New Jersey politican in action.  When presented with the choice of preserving our American heritage or selling out for the almighty buck, they will always choose the latter.</p>

		<p>Another Christie move that causes me to lose respect.  The last was to appoint a Muslim as a Superior Court judge and say &#8216;Who me worry about Shariah Law.&rsquo; when challenged about the appointment. Oh well, he has some strong features also.</p>

		<p>Is there no regular reader of Amren that is surprised by this?  Of course not.  More than any other sector of society, we have been forced to be uniquely aware of those things that others either refuse to see or intentionally hide- namely  that our politicians have long ago lost their collective sanity if not  conscious.  And most of us are left with that sick feeling in the pit of our stomach that it may be too late and too much to turn around from here without the remaining option of civil war. </p>

<p>I heard there was a Euro Heritage month. Where is it? Of course PBS along with our politicians, celebrates all these nonwhite &#8220;heritage&#8221; months as if they are the ones who built and maintained a White America. What a joke.  EVERY White person KNOWS deep down, that nonwhites do not belong here but are too afraid to admit it.</p>

<p>The nearly 100-year-old statue of Peter Stuyvesant, removed last year from in front of School 11, was taken out of storage yesterday and sent to the Beacon condominiums in Jersey City for its upcoming restoration.</p>
<p>The statue was dedicated in 1913, and stood in front of School 11 in Bergen Square until it was moved last February to make room for a monument to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the school&rsquo;s namesake.</p>
<p>But that monument never materialized, and the Stuyvesant statue, once it is restored and given a new pedestal, will return to its home in front of the school, city officials said.</p>

I wonder what Pete would think about his Jersey City now!  I often wonder what all of those involved in the Civil War would think of America today.  My guess is that the North would refuse to fight and both the North and South would follow Lincoln&rsquo;s post war plan and deport all blacks back to Africa and the Carribean.</p>

<p>Police Make Arrest In Woman&rsquo;s Slaying<br/>
43-Year-Old TSA Employee Found Dead In Her Apartment<br/>
 September 19, 2011</p>
<p>D&rsquo;IBERVILLE, Miss.   &mdash;   A Jackson man has been arrested in connection with the death of 43-year-old Stacey Wright, who was found dead earlier this week inside her D&rsquo;Iberville apartment. </p>
<p>Police Chief Wayne Payne said his department&rsquo;s investigation began Saturday night, when a concerned relative called to ask that police check on Wright. They were unable to locate her. </p>
<p>Police found Wright&rsquo;s body Sunday morning after building security unlocked the apartment door for them. She had been stabbed to death, Payne said. </p>
<p>Ruben Orlando Benitez, 45, was arrested in Jackson on Tuesday and is charged in connection with Wright&rsquo;s death, Payne said. </p>
<p>Investigators said Benitez and Wright both worked for the Transportation Security Administration. Police said Benitez and Wright got into an altercation Saturday at Wright&rsquo;s apartment, which led to her death. </p>
<p>Benitez was being taken Tuesday to the Harrison County Adult Detention Center where he will be held on a $3 million bond. </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a ton of &#8216;celebrate&rsquo; latino stuff going on all over these days.  Where I&rsquo;m at, it happens on a monthly basis.  Funny thing is, the liberals who control marketing are keeping latinos off the pages and out of the ads.</p>
<p>Think on this:  there are more latinos than blacks now in this country, but how often do you see latinos (especially the real dark, amerindian types) in any advertisements, anywhere?</p>
<p>You see blacks in ads no 40% or more of the time.  In some publications, the ads are over 50% featuring black models, actors and all that.  But no latinos.</p>
<p>The liberal &#8216;diversity&rsquo; marketers know that if they had 50% of the ads in this country with real latinos (not the ones who are mostly caucasian), but the dark-skinned indians of the yucatan, bolivia, ecuador and so many of the other parts of latin america, they know that Americans would wake up and see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>You can go into Target and see 60-70% of the in-store posters and ads with blacks either alone or paired with a happy white person, but you won&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t see latinos much if at all.</p>
<p>I just got the new Landend catalog.  The cover had nine separate photos of a smiling blond girl, nuzzling and snuggling with her black beau.  Open the cover, a full page photo of the same.  Back cover, the black male, dressed as a yuppie, smiling from the full page.  </p>
<p>MLK statues going up everywhere.  Dead white guy statues being put away.  Our schools teaching a black-centric, social justice curriculum with marxist overtones.  &#8216;Wise&rsquo; latinas on our supreme court and filling up town halls all across the land.</p>
<p>We are being erased from this nation.</p>

		<p>Gov. Christie, as you may already know, is also a major booster/panderer for Muslims in New Jersey.  Why is this &#8220;conservative&#8221; now being mentioned by many as the Republican V.P. nominee in 2012?  Are Red State/Tea Party types that stupid?    </p>

<p>Not to be disagreeable I have noticed that Republicans make excuses for their members by calling them RINOS. However it seems to me that they say that about 90% of the Republicans. Maybe the real problem is that Republicans are in denial that Republicans are just as guilty as Dems when it come to matter of race. RINO is a term invented by Rush Limbaugh probably the biggest (figuratively and literally) race traitor in the United States. </p>

<p>Giving a little background to your point, he who does his show with half his brain tied behind his back finally said last week (and reiterated it today) what we&rsquo;ve known for 15 years, that if Texas and Florida go non-white, ergo goes blue, then the Republican Party is done nationally, as CA and NY are permanently blue because of non-white immigration.  Of course, he screwed it all up by not recognizing that Reagan&rsquo;s 1986 amnesty (*) was the reason CA went non-white ergo blue, then he said we needed another Reagan.  Sheesh.</p>
<p>The acronym RINO is basically a construct of lamestream conservatives and Reaganites as a mild slur against left-wing Republicans.  Just because I&rsquo;m not a left-wing Republican and use the acronym from time to time doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m a Reaganite, which I am not.  And just because RINO is a construct of Reaganites and because left-wing Republicans are sometimes treacherous doesn&rsquo;t mean that Reaganites don&rsquo;t get a lot wrong.  They do.</p>
<p>Any political movement or organization that is not explicitly white nationalist or race realist will eventually become anti-white, if it is not already.</p>
<p>* - To the Dutcholators (Reagan worshipers) reading this, you can spare us your constant excuse/canard that you break out with regularity, that the Democrats in Congress &#8220;fooled&#8221; Reagan then not holding up to their end of the bargain.  They say the Democrats &#8220;fooled&#8221; Reagan with the 1986 amnesty by not delivering on border security.  (That dog doesn&rsquo;t hunt b/c Reagan was the President, and controlled the military, INS, CBP, and so on.)  They say that the Democrats in Congress &#8220;fooled&#8221; Reagan by not delivering on spending cuts.  (Reagan didn&rsquo;t have to sign those big spending budgets).  But it&rsquo;s all so tiresome   &mdash;   At some point, gullibility ends and complicity begins.</p>

		<p>Wow.  I should not be astonished considering the fact that I was born and raise in this wonderful country.  However, I&rsquo;m appalled that people have such a white vs non-white opinion, especially about hispanics.  Not all hispanics were born outside of the United States for one and the last time I checked all of our families whether you consider yourself white or not, has their ancestry from another country except those with Native American descent.  And many Hispanics have more native blood than any one that might be commenting on this site. But I should not be surprised how a &#8220;white&#8221; person would smile and greet me as if I&rsquo;m one of them because of the color/tone of my skin though I am hispanic and republican (as conservative as they come).  I&rsquo;m just glad my identity is in the Lord Jesus Christ over any color, race or political agenda.  I pray that people would show alot more compassion and learn to work with people that don&rsquo;t look or talk like them.  People celebrate events like Hispanic Heritage month to counter these stereotypes and the xenophobia; to be able to share our culture with others and be proud to be as American as anyone else.  Many blessings and much hope to all. </p>
