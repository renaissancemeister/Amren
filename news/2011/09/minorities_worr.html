<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The top 10 children&rsquo;s health concerns among people of all races include childhood obesity, drug abuse, and smoking and teen pregnancy, according to a recent poll by the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children&rsquo;s Hospital National Poll of Children&rsquo;s Health.</p>
<p>The annual poll, released August 15, asked Hispanic, Black and White respondents to rank the importance of 23 health concerns for children in their own community. Different ethnicities indicated varying levels of concern for specific health issues.</p>
<p>Overall, Blacks and Hispanics were more likely than Whites to rank children&rsquo;s health issues as &#8220;a big problem&#8221; in the community.</p>
<p>The #2 children&rsquo;s health concern for Hispanics was teen pregnancy, with 44% of respondents calling it &#8220;a big problem,&#8221; compared with 33% of Blacks and 19% of Whites. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanics had the highest rate of teen pregnancy in 2009, with 70.1 births per 1,000 women aged 15-19, compared to a national rate of 39.1 births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Blacks, community safety concerns predominated. More than a third of Black respondents were extremely worried about the effects of gun-related injuries, school violence, and unsafe neighborhoods, issues that were not among the top concerns for Hispanics or Whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Childhood obesity ranked as a higher concern for whites (#1) than for Blacks (#2) and Hispanics (#3), but only 30% of Whites considered the disease to be &#8220;a big problem,&#8221; while 44% of both Blacks and Hispanics considered it &#8220;a big problem&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Childhood obesity ranked as a higher concern for whites (#1) than for Blacks (#2) and Hispanics (#3), but only 30% of Whites considered the disease to be &ldquo;a big problem,&rdquo; while 44% of both Blacks and Hispanics considered it &ldquo;a big problem&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obesity is not a disease.  It is usually merely the result of a bad diet and lack of exercise.  It has also been shown that obesity is the result of behavior modifying drugs such as Ritalin, that have often been prescribed to children and especially boys.</p>

		<p>I wonder why anyone is that worried about childhood and adolescent obesity.  Every time I have the opportunity to look, teenagers are too thin for their own good, with the exception of black girls - A really significant percentage of them are noticeably overweight.  I think Michelle Obama adopted this cause because it&rsquo;s most acutely a black female problem.</p>

		<p>In response to &#8220;Question Diversity&#8221;:</p>
<p>Perhaps it is a regional thing - but it is hardly Black teens alone that are overweight here in the Northeast! This trend seems especially true of young(Whites)ladies, who are FAR chunkier on average than they were when I was that age several decades ago. </p>
<p>I do agree that Black teens are fatter still and with even more frequency. But I rarely see teens I would categorize as too thin&hellip;very rarely! </p>

		<p>Do you notice how the title of the story is worded so that minority parents seem to be more concerned with the health of their children than white parents?  The title implies that non-whites are better parents.  The title should read: Minorities Need To Worry About Children&rsquo;s Health More Than White Counterparts.  </p>

<p>What?!</p>
<p>Obesity has also known to have genetic factors as well&hellip;But the argument that obesity caused by environmental factors like bad diet and lack of exercise &#8220;somehow&#8221; is a refuting argument for it not being a disease is beyond me.</p>
<p>disease /dis·ease/ (dĭ-zēz´) any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any body part, organ, or system that is manifested by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown.</p>

		<p>Why is America only fat since the pc age? Where are the studies? Yes we know the wild tales by these inferiors with exteeme low IQ genetically on how the FBI brought all the drugs into the black neighborhoods nationwide to get them addicted to crack or heroin to dispose of them or how the fast foods suddenly made all them obese diseased and unhealthy to get rid of them. </p>
<p>Always a conspiracy of white against black even though we know the real truth is the exact opposite and the onslaught seems to be led by some strange mutated sect of media-ites who have seized control of all the medium and snatched all the satellites in orbit infusing and injecting some horrific poison 24/7/365 in the airwaves that incredibly takes over the mind and body thus turning the individual into a robotic android follower to heeds all commands or suffer the fatal consequences.</p>

		<p>OK. Hispanic teen pregnancy? Most Hispanics are Catholic and don&rsquo;t use birth control so getting knocked up can be a real problem. </p>
<p>Fat kids? The reason why whites worry about over weight kids is because whites still expect to compete ( for jobs ) and a fat person doesn&rsquo;t have the same chance as a fit person. If you know that you are going to live off the state then being fat isn&rsquo;t a big problem for certain minorities, they mail out the checks. </p>

		<p>Teen pregnancies are considered a problem among Hispanics because there are still a lot of the older generation around who consider it shameful. <br/>
It is not a problem for blacks who think it is better for the girls to have children young and get those welfare checks started rolling in. <br/>
There are still too many teen pregnancies among whites, but  young white women know about birth control and abortion, and some of them even listen to their parents.</p>

		<p>Daniel #7: Most Blacks in the US are Protestant, and they don&rsquo;t use birth control, either. Probably because they can&rsquo;t figure out how to put the condom on. </p>
<p>The reason given for Whites being concerened about overweight children is not accurate. </p>
<p>First, hardly anyone is doing any physical labor, so they don&rsquo;t need to be an Adonnis to compete in the workplace. </p>
<p>Second, blacks and browns don&rsquo;t have the mental abilities that Whites do, so Uncle Scam gets involved to tilt the tables against more intelligent White people, in favor of their pet projects. </p>
<p>White parents, in general, show a deep concern over the health of their children, where blacks and browns show little interest, especially when you hear things like, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t know where they be at&#8221;. </p>
<p>Blacks and browns like to eat fast food garbage, where most Whites will have most of their meals at home. Not that Whites don&rsquo;t go to Wendy&rsquo;s or other such places, but it is normally a fast lunch in order to get somewhere in a hurry, or because they only have so many dollars in their pocket. </p>

		<p>Obesity is NOT a &#8220;disease&#8221;. It reflects a lack of discipline, low levels of activity and poor nutritional food choices. My cousin lost his hand to bone cancer. I&rsquo;m sure if he had been told if he exercised more and ate less fast food, it wouldn&rsquo;t have happened, that he would have done so. Let us save our sympathy for people who genuinely deserve it.</p>

		<p>When I was in elementary school, seeing an overweight classmate was rare.  Now, 30 years later, it seems that every classroom in my son&rsquo;s school has at least one overweight student.</p>
<p>I watch what I give my son.  Fast food is a treat, not standard everyday fare.  He&rsquo;s really active and he&rsquo;s about the right weight for his height.</p>

		<p>All you hear about is obesity. I was anorexic for most of my life, and it may have had something to do with my morbidly obese aunts being mean to me&hellip;</p>
<p>(At least one of my aunts starved her daughters while gaining another hundred lbs.) Now I hover at just the right weight for my height but getting depressed tends to lose me the few pounds that keeps me in the normal range.</p>
<p>As always, Ritalin is evil and I am glad I wised up soon enough to effect damage control. I quit taking my Ritalin, and all the other stupid pharmaceutical drugs parents put their children on in order to avoid dealing with the real problems. <br/>
I want to start making flyers about the evils of pharmaceuticals for children.<br/>
Notice to All White kids: stop taking your meds!</p>

		<p>They may worry more, but they do less.  The black population has far more child related injuries from parental lack of supervision or due care.  Seat belt usage is an example where parents could and don&rsquo;t assure compliance. Taking your kids to free medical care is another.</p>

		<p>Yeah, Ben, and any others who acted shocked at the idea that obesity is NOT a disease:</p>
<p>Ask a good endocrinologist; they will tell you, that time and again, real life experience and mountains of metabolic research prove that most people who are overweight- a little or a lot- are so, because they overeat for their activity level.</p>
<p>Even with hypothyroidism (I know firsthand), it is calories in vs. calories out. True, when your metabolism is suppressed, you burn less. But- according to my endocrinologist (top flight research hospital stuff), even people with hypothyroidism rarely have any significant drag on their metabolism that can&rsquo;t be overcome.</p>
<p>He did say &#8220;in very rare cases,&#8221; referring to those who just couldn&rsquo;t get slim. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been hypothyroid for at least 20 years, and have about 10% body fat. At age 46!<br/>
When I eat more and move less, I gain fat. When I move more and eat less, I lose it. Simple as that. It&rsquo;s basically a law of the universe. Plus, metabolism speeds up as you get more active. </p>
<p>Most really fat people are massive binge eaters. Even if they hide it. </p>
<p>Many fat people are not binge eaters at all, or even gluttons; they just keep consuming the same amount of calories they did when they were teenagers, and move less and less. It&rsquo;s ridiculously simple math.</p>
<p>When they were 18, they burned, say 3,500 calories a day. At age 28, after ten years of reduced activity, they burn 2,500 calories a day. Yet they still eat about 3,000 calories a day. So 500 calories a day gained on average is a whopping pound per week. That&rsquo;s 52 pounds in a year. <br/>
It&rsquo;s just that easy with sedentary lifestyles, a lack of discipline, and food surplusses!</p>
