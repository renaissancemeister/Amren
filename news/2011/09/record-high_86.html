<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Americans are approaching unanimity in their views of marriages between blacks and whites, with 86% now approving of such unions. Americans&rsquo; views on interracial marriage have undergone a major transformation in the past five decades. When Gallup first asked about black-white marriages in 1958, 4% approved. More Americans disapproved than approved until 1983, and approval did not exceed the majority level until 1997.</p>
<p>The latest results are based on an Aug. 4-7 <em>USA Today</em>/Gallup poll, which included an oversample of blacks.</p>
<p>Approval of black-white marriages is at a record high among blacks and whites. Blacks have always been more approving than whites of interracial marriage, going back to 1968 when Gallup first was able to report reliable estimates on each group&rsquo;s opinions. However, the gap in approval ratings has narrowed considerably, averaging 13 percentage points since 1997 but 32 points from 1968-1994.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Approval of black-white marriage is well above the majority level among all key subgroups, though slightly lower among Southerners, Republicans, conservatives, and those with no college education. Senior citizens are the least approving of black-white marriage among major subgroups, at 66%.</p>

		<p>Paraphrasing Bill Clinton again, it depends on what the meaning of &#8220;approve&#8221; is. Lots of people &#8220;approve&#8221; of miscegenation on television or in NYC, but you get closer to their town, their neighborhood, and their relatives, their &#8220;approval&#8221; rating drops, until you get to THEIR DAUGHTER, at which time their approval rating hits absolute zero.</p>

<p>This just shows there&rsquo;s a growing gap between reality and what people believe reality to be. The number of white women/black men &#8216;marriages&rsquo; rose all during that time, from 1958 until the 1990&rsquo;s until now over 80% of black children are born out side of marriage, and yet the number of people approving of interracial &#8216;marriage&rsquo; triples.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always the possibility these folks may have been on, some level, suspicious their phones were being bugged or their answers recorded. </p>

		<p>People just say what they think they should say. The numbers who agree with mixed marriages aren&rsquo;t anywhere near that high. Not counting the blacks of course. To them marrying anyone of any other race is a step up.</p>

		<p>Like many surveys and &#8216;studies&rsquo; the methodology may be flawed or taken under conditions that are suspect and not likely to obtain true results. Note how the first question originally refers basically to blacks and NOW to non-whites. That is a whole new dimension altogether. Another factor may be the &#8216;Bradley effect&rsquo; as some whites may have felt awkward or pressured to say the &#8220;right&#8221; (politically correct thing). I also find it interesting that blacks are more in favour of this. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they be? Inter-marriage to a lighter-skinned, higher I.Q. group is in their interests. It is NOT in the interests of the latter group in question.</p>

<p>My answer is, no, I do not.</p>
<p>I believe a black person would be in bad company to be with a white person who would marry him or her.</p>
<p>I would also add that I did not support miscegenation laws. People have the right to do some things, as disgusting as they may be.</p>

		<p>The fact is that most people believe and realize that whomever a person dates marries or socializes with it ultimately their decision. In essence, it is no one elses business. </p>
<p>I am not a fann of ineracil marriages, but I also am aware that it is not my concern whether another person wants to date, have sex with or marry a person of another race or the same sex for tha matter. That is their right to do so.<br>

		<p>While 86% sounds suspiciously high, I sadly do believe that easily three-quarters of Americans are fine with miscegenation, and clearly among those aged 30 and under, the number is that much higher. I know people who are, by any modern standard, full-blown &#8220;racists,&#8221; yet they hardly bat an eye at mixed-race couples. </p>
<p>One does wonder, though, what the percentage would be for White fathers with young daughters who wish to &#8220;date&#8221; Blacks!?!</p>

		<p>Did anyone see footage of the West Indian Day parade in New York City. There were some White cops behaving very unprofessionally with some of the female women (Black women) in attendance. In fact AOL had the video on its page today. You can probably find it on you tube. </p>
<p>They men and women were behaving like wild animals. I was shocked at what I saw. These were police officers mind you.<br>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they conduct a poll on how many approve black/Asian marriages; black/Hispanic marriages; and black/Indian marriages, targeting the racial/ethnic population in those groups?</p>
<p>Why does everything have to be compared only between blacks and whites, especially since blacks comprise just 12.6% of the population and the remaining minority groups are far greater in numbers than blacks?</p>

		<p>Any public opinion poll or article that goes against or is in opposition to the established European American/European standards, customs, values, etc. will, ultimately, end up with an anti-European American conclusion or spin.  Any White-Black racial poll that comes from Princeton, New Jersey would be suspect, at least, as far as the truth is concerned.</p>
<p>These public opinion polls love to tell people, what to think and how to believe.  I would think, in having a number of returning interviewees does skew and will slant the poll toward a certain direction or conclusion (these pollsters know the perspectives and views of people previously questioned).  One must ask the question, what type people conduct the vast majority of public opinion polls.  And, what happens to be the desired result said people are after (anything that is anti-European American/European [anti-White establishment]).  I wonder how many Whites told the pollsters what they thought the pollsters just wanted to hear?  And I wonder how many Whites really trust the person on the other end of the telephone with their true feelings?    <br>
  <br>
One would never see the results of a public opinion poll concerning the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 (life/society before the 1965 Act and life/society now) or a public opinion poll of life/society in the 1950s compared with life/society in the 2010s.  Yet, the government and its agencies tell us (European Americans/Europeans) that diversity is our strength.     <br>

		<p>The Amren subtitle on this story is, &#8220;At least that is what they tell a telephone pollster.&#8221; That is a good point, and there could be a vast difference between what Americans truly feel about interracial marriages and what they tell a telephone pollster. </p>
<p>However, if the study has always been conducted by telephone and yet American&rsquo;s responses have changed, that could be a troubling sign. Is this what they really feel or is this what they feel pressured by society into telling a pollster?</p>
<p><i> Senior citizens are the least approving of black-white marriage among major subgroups, at 66%. </i> </p>
<p>Some people may point to this as proof that people &#8220;wise up&#8221; by their senior years. On the other hand, it could sadly just mean that those who disapprove of interracial relationships are dying out.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Approval of black-white marriage is well above the majority level among all key subgroups, though slightly lower among Southerners, Republicans, conservatives, and those with no college education.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have an advanced degree and I still don&rsquo;t approve.  I think it is that I got mine in the early 80s, before the colleges became Diversity training camps, filled with propaganda and brainwashing experts they call professors.</p>
<p>I also wonder a bit about the 86% approval claim.  It may well be in the semantics of the poll takers.  If confronted on a telephone about your real feelings, you will say what you know you&rsquo;re expected to say, to be safe.  I don&rsquo;t think most people mean most of the things the PC facade requires them to mouth.  The way the polsters ask the question is often aimed at desired results;  a choice between two answers rather than saying what you really think.  Really, when I get a call from a pollster, I hang up.  I don&rsquo;t want their opinions to be wrested from my mouth.</p>
<p>This poll really doesn&rsquo;t mean very much. It will be used to attempt to gather in those on the fence to join in on the big, miscegenation gang bang.  Imagine the majority of white women fighting over the actual very few available blacks.  Maybe they&rsquo;ll make a tv reality show out of it.</p>

		<p>I believe many people gave politically correct answers to placate the poll taker.</p>
<p>Ask most whites in private and you can reverse the numbers.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t care what blacks think - they will hook up with anyone, especially if some personal gain (money) is involved. It&rsquo;s like asking a cat if they approve of being fed by pet owners.</p>
<p>Besides, what&rsquo;s the point of this poll? To me, it&rsquo;s liberal, Marxist propaganda designed to sway the thinking of empty-headed readers. It implies if you &#8220;disapprove&#8221; you&rsquo;re some kind of racist nut who is not thinking like everybody else.</p>
<p>I believe the inter-racial marriage numbers are still rather low despite the black-white race mixing being shoved in our face 24/7 by the media. If, as they say, 86% approve (does that really mean &#8220;tolerate&#8221;) you&rsquo;d think the numbers would be higher.</p>
<p>I find this poll both leading and offensive. </p>

		<p>In the late 1990&rsquo;s the rap group Public Enemy had a &#8220;hit&#8221; called &#8220;Fear of a Black Planet.&#8221;  It had the following lyrics :</p>
<p><br>
Black man, black woman, black baby<br>
White man, white woman, white baby<br>
White man, black woman, black baby<br>
Black man, white woman, black baby</p>
<p>There was no reaction to this although the message is as clear as can be.  Don&rsquo;t expect anything now.  Large numbers of young white people have been trained to support the death of their own race.    <br>
You are hiding from reality to think many of them <br>
&#8220;told&#8221; the pollster some thing other then what they believe.</p>

		<p>So? When you look at the kind of White women that date Black men, it&rsquo;s not hard to encourage the phenomenon. Nobody in E.Europe is up in arms over miscegenating with Gypsies because it&rsquo;s a sign of personal failure and I think that attitude is catching on with White America. </p>

		<p>  I&rsquo;m not particularly surprised by these figures, particularly among today&rsquo;s youth where miscegenation seems widely accepted. The relentless campaign by the promoters of popular culture to encourage miscegenation has been very effective. Black men and white women are often paired together as anchors on news programs or on syndicated drama or comedy television shows. Trendy Hollywood actresses seem to make a point of adopting black children to get the maximum level of publicity. All in all, the great liberal dream of eliminating racism through miscegenation is gathering momentum. Unfortunately, turning the United States into another Brazil (without the fun) or Egypt will not eliminate racism, but only change it.</p>

		<p>I seriously doubt these stats and declarations.  There is is HUGE difference between merely tolerating something, and approving of it.  One tolerates something that is less than ideal.  One approves of something that is the ideal, or is beneficial.  There is nothing beneficial about white women going with black men.  Neither to society, nor to themselves.  We tolerate it, but mutter under our breath when we see it.  We do NOT in America APPROVE of it as the thing to do.  More lies from the media.  And who trusts polls anyway?  You are an idiot of you trust &#8220;polls&#8221;.  They are almost always geared to an outcome by the way the questions are asked, the sampling demographics chosen, and by the poll takers themselves in reporting the &#8220;results&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>One does not get places by changing people&rsquo;s opinions. One gets places by articulating and channeling attitudes that already exist. Public acceptance of inter racial marriage, like public acceptance of gay rights, has increased dramatically since the 1950s. These attitudes are unlikely to reverse. <br>
 <br>
It is not possible to repeal the civil rights legislation of the 1960s and restore Jim Crow legislation. A movement that tries will destroy its credibility and weaken its ability to succeed on issues where it could win. <br>
 <br>
I agree with American Renaissance on three issues where political advances are possible. First, AR advocates restrictions on immigration, especially third world immigration. Second, AR publicizes the reality of black social pathology, especially black crime. Third, AR defends and popularizes books like &#8220;The Bell Curve,&#8221; by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, and &#8220;The 10,000 Year Explosion,&#8221; by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending<br>

		<p>I was recently in my home town in Massachusetts for a visit. When i was a child in the 70s, it was a scene from Leave it to Beaver.  It&rsquo;s much different now of course. I brought my niece to the shopping mall for ice cream. I did see some interracial dating, but not as much as I thought. There are still mostly whites&hellip;but things are really decaying. The girls mostly have tattoos and strang piercings. The teenage girls are still petite and in shape&hellip;.past the mid-20s, many are horribly obese, toting around screaming babies. I did not see the &#8220;fathers&#8221; anywhere. Im sure they were nothing to write home about either. I blame the decay on lack of religion and I blame liberal media. In this day and age, anything goes. There are no longer any moral boundaries. In the past, both whites and black were against mixed marriage. Yes, some people on both sides were full of hate, but many were not. It was just common sense and decency to date your own and not ruin your future children&rsquo;s life&hellip; those ideals are mostly dead now.</p>

		<p>OKCupid showed in a detailed statistical analysis on the basis of IR dating that white women is the most reactionary(or self-preserving if you will) to talk to and contact men of other races, as well as respond to incoming messages. They were also the group which gave the highest reading on the question &#8216;I want my children to look like me&rsquo;.</p>
<p>True, those white women who tend to IR tend to do it with low-class folks. White men like asian(esp east asian) women, which some of the quality of white men.</p>
<p>Nontheless, if you account for the total amount of IR dating then white men are more likely to do it and do so too.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly it also showed that black men are the most likely group(actually by over ten times) than any other to want to date interracially. In fact, they had a stronger preference for non-black women than black women.</p>
<p>Also, their highest preferance was for hispanic and native american women, not white(although they were not far behind on the list). The difference is that there are simply so many white women compared to, say, NA women that the numbers get a bit skewed.</p>
<p>About 55-56 % of white women stated explicitly that they want white children, and that&rsquo;s just those who are willing to admit it.</p>
<p>When looking at how often they contact other men of other races and respond back to men of other races, we&rsquo;re talking about a solid 85 % majority who go strictly white.</p>
<p>Note: the people on OKCupid are more liberal and more young than the average population. It&rsquo;s also more educated. All these factors have shown a higher willingless to date interracially. So figure what the stats are for the general population.</p>
<p>A lot of people on here forget that only about 5 % of all new marriages with a white individual involved is interracially, and that includes hispanic whites, east asians etc.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t IR dating or anything like that. It&rsquo;s the immigration issue. Always has been and always will be.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t understand why anyone would NOT question Black-White marriages. After all, Blacks are taught from birth that &#8220;whitey&#8221; is to blame for all Blacks&rsquo; problems. Doesn&rsquo;t this concern anyone?</p>
<p>If you are taught animosity towards a race, why would you want anything to do with that race? My belief is that many Black men who marry White women are basically looking for a woman to dominate and perhaps a way to &#8220;get back&#8221; at &#8220;whitey.&#8221; After all, this White woman is one woman that a White man cannot have.</p>
<p>My own experience of Black men wanting to date me(and never succeeding!)is that they tend to be domineering and expect me to do as I am told. I, of course, would have to watch everything I do and say. This is not a good reason to be in a relationship. </p>

That will never be me though. I have told my children that it is their right to marry outside the White race, and that I want them to be happy with whomever they choose as a partner. But if they decide to marry non-White, they also understand that they will lose their father.  I would not consider their children to be my grandchildren, and I would break contact and disinherit my own child.  I brought this up to them not as an ultimatum of hatred, as I certainly do not desire rebellious children, but as a straightforward point of fact. Having lived in a multicultural environment, they seem amenable to my line of thought.</p>

		<p>I have researched the pros &amp; cons of miscegenation since I corresponded with the late Professor Ruggles Gates.  The propaganda promoting black-white crossing (not necessarily matrimony) began more intensively in Britain than in the USA, but has followed similar lines, starting with the mantra that &#8220;racism&#8221; can only finally be solved &#8220;in the bedroom&#8221; and better still the maternity ward.  In Britain the collapse in general public resistance dates from the 1970s but during the past ten years has accelerated in media imagery, which more than merely &#8220;reflects&#8221; reality.  Black men, especially sports stars, are shown in contact with white girl friends; black dancers are paired with white girls not only in &#8220;pop&#8221; videos (where beautiful whites are sexually displayed to savage-looking gangsta types, &c;) but in ballet&rsquo;; ditto, cinema and theatre pairings (with blacks playing e.g. Shakesperian heroes other than Othello); adverts for beds often pair black men with white women, &amp; so forth.  An interesting social development in England is the pairing of black men with white women, and older white men with Asian women, often extremely ugly Filipino types probably obtained through internet dating (passports to paradise) and some younger white men with relatively attractive Chinese student types.  Of course, the mixture is negligible in Asia or Africa as a whole; only the white &#8220;metropolis&#8221; is seriously affected, so that racial suicide is almost entirely a fatality for the whites.  On a large scale, black-white crossing is dysgenic, and the possibility of biological disharmonies has not been refuted satisfactorily by pro-miscegenation writers like K. Dyer.  In fact, there has been very little objective research into this issue for half a century.  It is part of the anti-&#8220;racist&#8221; taboo.  Of course, once a society mixes on a Brazilian scale, any problems cannot be unravelled.  It is not an experiment with any justification, and the argument that it doesn&rsquo;t matter because individuals fall in love is partly refuted by the breakdown in mixed partnerships and the disproportionate violence from black males to their white women, and their notorious promiscuity.  A minor consequence is the effect on black women who feel deserted and who compensate by making themselves more sexually desirable in unfortunate ways  </p>

		<p>Marriage is a very personal issue and the decision (of wether or not to marry) is to be made only by the two people involved. I myself know several interracial couples (White-Black, White-Asian, White-Latino and even Cuban-Italian) who are very decent people and who get along very well. Not ALL people who marry and/or become romantically involved with people from outside their race or ethnicity are of the kind who appear on any of the daytime talk shows (Jerry Springer, etc.)  &mdash;  the ones I personally know are actually very nice people. All ethnicities, races and cultural groups have their own good and bad people  &mdash;  as such, it&rsquo;s NOT prudent or wise to judge a people (wether White, Black, Latino, Asian, etc.) by the worst it has to offer.</p>

  And why do they have this parade anyway? This is another reason why many Americans werent upset when New York City was bombed by Muslims</p>

		<p>I do not believe that the numbers represented are, in fact, true samples of American white citizens. Gallup is certainly not friendly to White people or racists. These numbers are a lie and fantasy. Let me post my remarks about Blacks in a major newspaper and on television. Censored? You had better believe that!!</p>

		<p>Probably many of the respondents sensed a question beneath the question, on the order of &#8220;We&rsquo;re trying to find out if you&rsquo;re a racist. Are you?&#8221; Heard that way, the question almost compels the answer, &#8220;Who, me? I&rsquo;m no racist&#8221;, which in this context would be expressed as &#8220;I don&rsquo;t disapprove of mixed marriages&#8221;.</p>

		<p>this is great proof of the power of the media over society and our beliefs.<br>
during the 80&rsquo;s is when we got to see how awesome michael jackson (pedophile), eddie murphy (homosexual), jessie jackson (not enough time to start on him), etc. are.<br>
I guarantee this isn&rsquo;t white men drooling over black women - gross.<br>
BUT, white women who want to try a black because they are dumb enough to believe all of their made up hype.<br>
I always find it interesting to see a white woman walking down the street with blacks in tow. No daddy to be seen - AND no white man will ever touch them again.<br>
They always look like they came from the bottom of the barrel - exactly what blacks can get.<br>
Personally, I appreciate this sign, which, to me, loudly states - &#8216;I&rsquo;m a loser&rsquo; and here&rsquo;s my proof, &#8216;come on- Jethro Jr.&#8221;<br>
it would be funny if it wasn&rsquo;t so sad and pathetic.</p>

		<p>From whom did they gather these numbers?  Were those questioned limited to Blacks and Whites or did they also ask Hispanics, Asians and others whether they approved or disapproved of Black/White marriage?  Regardless, I think political correctness skews the numbers of any poll that asks about racial issues.  Were people truthful, these numbers would plummet.  Are we really supposed to believe that black females overwhelmingly approve of black men marrying White women?  Or that the majority of black men don&rsquo;t feel angry when they see a black woman with a White man?  I&rsquo;ve known people in Black/White relationships and they all said that the most of the hateful stares, voiced disapproval and overall hostility was from blacks.  The next article here on AmRen which suggests that black women should look outside their race for marriage, and the subsequent disapproval expressed by some of those interviewed, seems to contradict the results of this poll.</p>

		<p>Our bigger problem is that we are being out-bred by non-Whites in our own countries.  Low White fertility and non-White immigration into White countries is what is killing the White race rather than miscegenation.  I rarely see any White involved in an interracial relationship that we would really want to keep anyway.  Let the White women who dates Blacks have fun with their new biracial children and Black in-laws.  They most likely are where they belong.</p>

Did anyone see footage of the West Indian Day parade in New York City. There were some White cops behaving very unprofessionally with some of the female women (Black women) in attendance. In fact AOL had the video on its page today. You can probably find it on you tube. </p>
<p>They men and women were behaving like wild animals. I was shocked at what I saw. These were police officers mind you.<br>

<p>This does not surprise me at all. In fact, I have seen stories over the years on this website where posters have metioned sex scandals that have taken place in their towns involving White police officers and Black women and in some cases, Hispanic women. </p>
<p>To be sure, men regardles of profession, can be predatory and  crude; however it seems that police officers tend to be more inclined to do so. I have a friend who once told me that cops tend to be the &#8220;mentally unbalanced bullies and stupid jocks<br>
from high school&#8221; who took pleasure in harrasing the nerds and other socially awkward students. Becoming police officers affords them the opportunity to perversely exercise their twisted psyches on the larger society.</p>
<p>To some of you AMREN posters who tend to roll over backwards defending cops as pargaons as virtues (and many of them are decent people), I realize that not all cops are this way, but too many do seem to have a screw loose and posess questionable morals.  </p>

I believe many people gave politically correct answers to placate the poll taker.</p>
<p>Ask most whites in private and you can reverse the numbers.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t care what blacks think - they will hook up with anyone, especially if some personal gain (money) is involved. It&rsquo;s like asking a cat if they approve of being fed by pet owners.</p>
<p>Besides, what&rsquo;s the point of this poll? To me, it&rsquo;s liberal, Marxist propaganda designed to sway the thinking of empty-headed readers. It implies if you &ldquo;disapprove&rdquo; you&rsquo;re some kind of racist nut who is not thinking like everybody else.</p>
<p>I believe the inter-racial marriage numbers are still rather low despite the black-white race mixing being shoved in our face 24/7 by the media. If, as they say, 86% approve (does that really mean &ldquo;tolerate&rdquo;) you&rsquo;d think the numbers would be higher.</p>
<p>I find this poll both leading and offensive.</p>

<p>The male admitted that his mother was initially cool to the marriage, yet still was respectful to his wife. However, once her first grandchild was born, she fell in love with him (the grandchild)and his younger baby brother and the entire family has gotten even closer. </p>

		<p>I thoroughly enjoy tele-pollsters and marketers. The coast guard had a puppy from NYC call the other week about my commercial boating habits. I told him I had five boats. The largest was a Klar (viking longboat) that I used during harvest season to raid southwest Iowa. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if that was &#8216;commercial&rsquo; or not as he didn&rsquo;t have a slot for it in his survey. What really got the supervisor was the 10&rsquo; stock tank. I only used it for three days as a boat, unpowered, and the rest of the year it was used commercially as a stock tank. I had to carefully explain &#8216;stock&rsquo; and &#8216;tank&rsquo; to the urbanite. Good fun was had by all&hellip; except the coast guard.</p>

		<p>Depressing and, in one respect, surprising - that so many who were opposed only twenty years ago are now in favour. I strongly suspect that the position is at least as bad in the other white English speaking countries.</p>
<p>The rapidity of the change (look at the extraordinary leaps in approvals between 1994 and 1997 and between 2002 and 2007) does suggest, however, that the shift in opinion is shallow and certainly motivated in part by a desire not to appear politically incorrect.</p>
<p>The way to recovery, and hence to survival for the white race, is to present the avoidance of race mixing as a matter of conservation because that too is a politically correct position - how could anyone be opposed to the conservation of natural varieties? An acceptance of that argument leads naturally to a belief that some degree of segregation is necessary. What won&rsquo;t work, because people really do not want to hear it until they are ready for it, is the stuff about racial inequality and difference.</p>

<p>You must understand that, in America, mulatto children will identify and be identified as black. It is highly likely that they will mate with other blacks. So, if one&rsquo;s child mates with a black, one&rsquo;s line will likely pass into the black race. This would seem to be in contrast to Brazil, where a white can (I assume) mate with a black, and the resulting offspring would likely, depending on his/her social station, marry a white, or another mixed-race individual. </p>
<p>Those (obviously mostly-white) women whose photos you posted are hot, and I can understand why a white man might wish to lie with any of them with the expectation that the offspring will easily pass into white society. But that scenario is simply not what we&rsquo;re talking about when we debate interracial dating in the U.S., not in terms of the phenotype of the &#8220;out-race&#8221; individuals, and not in terms of the future prospects for the offspring of such unions.</p>

		<p>Bill Clinton thinks it&rsquo;s OK, but when a Black African offered Hillary 40 goats and a Cow to marry Chelsea, while she was on a State visit to Africa, Hillary shot that offer right down. </p>

<p>Those same White women that I have seen married to Blacks get the cold shoulder, no recpetion at all from people that I know, and for good reason. Why would you want to show that you accept their bad choices? </p>
<p>If they did drugs, we would not have anything to do with them, either. </p>
<p>The majority of these people are White women, that is, ugly White women, and one wonders if that is why they married Black men. Because in their own minds, they would not find a marrying White man. </p>
<p>People need to educate their kids at the earliest of ages, and have them understand that non-Whites are completely off limits to them.</p>

		<p>Further brief thoughts on the very complicated though extremely topical issue of racial crossing.<br>
1. Race is not an illusion, and races are populations that have selectively and differently adapted over past millennia to diverse econiches on the planet.<br>
2. Because they are all human, races are interfertile, but crossing of very different races can cause problems for subsequent offspring, weaknesses possibly &#8220;compensated&#8221; by fecundity (not sterility).<br>
3. &#8220;Mulattoes appear to show less resistance to all kinds of diseases&hellip;yet very little light has been thrown on it&#8221; (Eugen Fischer).<br>
4. Some famous names can be quoted AGAINST large-scale wide outcrossing; e.g. Herbert Spencer, Gustave LeBon, William McDougall, Marcus Garvey, John Allegro, Sir George Stapledon, &c.;<br>
5. Objective extensive research into miscegenation has been virtually non-existent since the mid-1960s and the campaign against segregation in the USA and RSA.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whiteness&#8221; is a matter of degree. Europeans from the Balkans,Central Asians, and Asian Indians all seem to represent an intermediate type between pure West European and East Asian.
