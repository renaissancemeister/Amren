			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry J. Reske, Newsmax, September 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Allegations of widespread fraud in Social Security disability claims in Puerto Rico are being investigated by the SSA&rsquo;s inspector general.</p>
<p>The investigation stems from the closing of a pharmaceutical plant where 290 of 300 laid off workers filed for disability benefits using the same doctor, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A March <em>Wall Street Journal</em> story found that in 2010 benefits were awarded in 63.4 percent of cases in Puerto Rico, far higher than in other locations. The <em>Journal</em> report also found that nine of the 10 top U.S. zip codes for workers collecting Social Security disability benefits are in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>A Social Security Administration spokesman said in light of &#8220;statistical trends&#8221; in Puerto Rico it has asked the inspector general&rsquo;s office to &#8220;make sure that these trends do not reflect an increase in fraud,&#8221; the <em>Journal</em> reported. {snip}</p>

		<p>Unless low intelligence is now considered a disability, there is no doubt widespread welfare fraud in Puerto Rico. Why on earth do we continue to hang onto this largely non white albatross? Yeah, yeah, maybe there were reasons during the cold war to have a US territorial presence down there but that&rsquo;s in the past. They got their own flag (which stateside PRs can&rsquo;t stop waving, btw) and their own language (Spanish) and culture. They&rsquo;re &#8216;Americans&rsquo; in name only. It&rsquo;s high time we cut them off. Unfortunately, there already are millions of PRs living in the US mainland. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t whites lose their jobs? Don&rsquo;t whites apply for benefits or disability in their offices? Sounds like those bureaucrats &#8216;doing all they can&rsquo; to be &#8216;inclusive&rsquo; no matter the cost, as job one, sounds like they should lead the way making things all even by example.</p>

		<p>Puerto Rico is &#8220;America&#8221; enough for Puertos to collect American welfare, but it&rsquo;s &#8220;not America&#8221; enough for Microsoft to shift most of their corporate operations there on paper such that it only has an effective American income tax rate of 7%:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/WHsBw" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/WHsBw</a></p>
<p>This whole operation can only happen because MSFT has a plant in Puerto Rico where physical DVDs and CDs of Microsoft products are manufactured.  Now, to whom this may concern, I ask you:  When was the last time you actually dealt with an official Microsoft physical disc to install a Microsoft software product?  </p>

		<p>Why the USA didn&rsquo;t just let this useless and parasitical island go a long time ago utterly baffles me. At least the British had the brains to unload basketcase Jamaica in 1962. I am at a loss to think of one single gain or benefit Puerto Rico has ever provided to the USA. Anyone? Gold? No. Oil? No. High I.Q., hard-working population? No. Again anyone?</p>

		<p>Most of the Prs I have ever met are fragile weaklings. A strong wind can knock them over. The government, no doubt will discover that all the PRs are disable and deserve the benefits.</p>

		<p>In Oregon the state disablity system is corrupt against the people who are injured.  I heard my examining doctors discussing how they would fake up the report One of the two did not even appear for exam at all mearly signing it as agreeing with the other doctor.  they are totally corrupt and try to scare off people before the exam with threats of investigations into one past etc.</p>

		<p>No surprise here.  Fleece Uncle Sucker is the general philosophy of the island.  The thought is if they allow it and they have the money, why not?  One small example postage stamps are often not canceled and used again and again.</p>

		<p>My husband and I went on a cruise and it stopped in San Juan. We went on a tour and tour guide told us that the majority of the island was on welfare and receives free health care courtesy of the US taxpayers. Myself and a bunch of the other people vowed to never go there again. </p>

		<p>I work within the system.  What happens is that there is no SSI in PR, so applicants temporarily move to the States and apply. Usually they stay with a friend or relative.  Usually none of them speak English, so you never know if what they are saying is truthful.  Once they apply they move back to PR.  There is a PR, FL, NJ and NY pipeline for SSI applicants.  They all have back pain, anxiety, and the kids have learning disabilities.  What a scam.  They make it to an Administrative Law Judge who has no  real constraints, and allows them for no reason.  Once the claim is allowed the checks are direct deposited into the Banco Popular.  White people are so stupid to put up with this larceny.</p>

		<p>Decades ago, half the PR population was on food stamps, courtesy of Sen. Al D&rsquo;Amato, so this fraud doesn&rsquo;t surprise me. </p>
<p>SSDI is going broke fast and this doesn&rsquo;t help matters. Cast the worthless island adrift. Screw the drug companies that use it as a tax haven.</p>

		<p>Puerto Ricans, like the rest of them, are a real drain on White Society. Kick what resembles a country loose, and send it on its own way. We don&rsquo;t need it at all. </p>

		<p>I know someone who really is disabled and tried to claim benefits.  She was denied the first time, which almost always happens.  And then two more times.  Her lawyer told her that there is a race component (whites less likely to be approved) and a geographic component.  He told her it&rsquo;s harder to win your case in Queens but much easier in the Bronx (majority black/brown).  The other race/ethnic component comes up when the applicant is sent to a specialist to be evaluated.  Don&rsquo;t tell me that the Asian doctor in Flushing, Queens is not going to side with his people.  Can anyone explain to me how the program was expanded to give SSI to elderly immigrants who have never worked a day in this country?  Also, does anyone remember the story about 15 years ago about a Puerto Rican family (I think in PA) that had almost every member on SSI?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll take a stab at it&hellip;the US holds on to PR for the very examples you set forth as reasons to end this union. Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s the duty of the United States to prop up ever third world brown nation we can locate? Even better of they have no chance in hell of ever being self-sustaining like PR.</p>
<p> Not a chance in hell the US ever abandons a territory with as many challenges as PR, especially in this day of political correctness and anti-white hatred. </p>
<p>Besides, it wouldn&rsquo;t be politically correct to dump PR. In fact it would be &ldquo;racist&rdquo; to do so. Can&rsquo;t you already hear it? <br>

		<p>Maybe they should change the name of the island to Puerto RICO (as in RICO Statutes).</p>
<p>And, Mr. White, someday if we&rsquo;re lucky we&rsquo;ll hear a President give this little speech:</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States has decided to right a historic wrong. We have decided to grant the people of Puerto Rico full autonomy and independence, in order to free them from the yoke of the White man&rsquo;s oppression. We welcome the new country of Puerto Rico into the brotherhood of nations!<br>
 <br>
&#8221; Of course, your new citizens will also be free from the burdens of filling out all those SSI forms, since they are no longer eligible for benefits. You have ten days to leave the United States, as we know you&rsquo;ll want take part in the building of your new homeland.  Thank you, and good night.&#8221;</p>
