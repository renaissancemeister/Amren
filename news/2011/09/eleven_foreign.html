			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead and Duncan Gardham, Telegraph (London), September 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>At least eleven foreign-born terrorists who should have been deported from Britain after finishing prison terms are still walking the streets.</p>
<p>They include offenders who helped the July 21 bomb plotters a fortnight after the 7/7 atrocity.</p>
<p>Seven are fighting deportation on human rights grounds, meaning they may never leave. Last night government officials refused to identify them or say what has happened to the other four.</p>
<p>The list is known to include Siraj Ali, who aided the failed July 21 suicide bomb plotters and was jailed for nine years.</p>
<p>Ali is the foster brother of Yassin Omar, the failed Warren Street bomber, and housed Muktar Ibrahim, another of the would-be bombers, while the devices were being made in a council flat a floor below.</p>
<p>He is using taxpayer-funded legal advice to fight deportation to Eritrea, even though Britain returns hundreds of people there every year.</p>
<p>Ismail Abdurahman, 28, who was jailed for eight years after he hid would-be 21/7 bomber Hussain Osman for three days, is also fighting deportation to Somalia.</p>
<p>It is understood the seven also includes the brother and sister Esayas and Mulu Girma, who are fighting deportation to Ethiopia. Osman&rsquo;s wife Yeshiemebet, who is still in jail, and her brother, Esayas, picked up Osman and drove him to their sister Mulu&rsquo;s house, in Brighton where she dressed his wounds from the failed attack.</p>
<p>A man who was jailed for two years after making a hoax bomb call is also resisting deportation.</p>
<p>It is known 11 terrorists are on the streets after the Henry Jackson Society, a think tank, compiled a list of a possible 16.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice insisted six of those were either deported or in custody but refused to say which ones. The 11th</p>
<p>is Jeyabalasingam, who was not on the list.</p>
<p>Houriya Ahmed, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, said: &#8220;Earlier this year the Government said they were going to deport those found guilty of terrorism offences by obtaining assurances from foreign governments that prisoners won&rsquo;t be abused upon their return to their home country.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, as is often the case, our obligations to the European Human Rights Convention impedes us from deporting those who plotted against this country and our government has obviously not resolved this.</p>
<p>&#8220;If our government cannot deport foreign nationals convicted of terrorism offences because of its obligations to the European Human Rights Convention, despite getting assurances that prisoners won&rsquo;t be tortured by the government in their home country, then how can the UK be expected to fully protect its national security?&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night a Home Office spokesman said: &#8220;We believe any foreign criminal convicted of a serious terrorism-related offence should be removed from the UK at the earliest opportunity and where possible held in immigration detention until deported.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently pursuing deportation against a number of individuals and will consider action against the rest towards the end of their sentences.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Brits had no problem treating IRA &#8220;suspects&#8221; brutally, holding them indefinitely without charge, waterboarding them, engaging in assassinations abroad&hellip;but when it comes to people with darker skin and lower IQs, somehow the Brits go all mushy. The idea that they&rsquo;d give an IRA suspect a human rights lawyer and a platform to make his case is laughable, but change his name to Ahmed and everything changes. The only explanation can be the cultural Marxism which has seeped deep into Britain&rsquo;s pores. They reserve their deepest hatred for other whites (particularly Americans) while pandering and catering to Pakistanis who want to kill them. So yes, they&rsquo;ve lost their minds.</p>

		<p>In response to Anonymous at 8:35, we can say that the Irish have been warm and welcoming to third world immigrants from Africa and wherever, while still &#8221;reserving their deepest hatred for whites&#8221;, particularly English Whites. So the cultural Marxism unfortunately has seeped into the pores of Europe generally and our country too, for that matter. </p>

		<p>Not &#8220;the Brits&#8221; but the gang which has been in control of Britain for years past and which is difficult to dislodge without comparable election funds and media support, especially the &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; BBC.</p>

   (1) &#8220;We have opened our doors to more than five million people in the last ten years, only a minority of them Poles&hellip; And these new arrivals have driven down the wages for the very people Ed[Miliband]&rsquo;s party was set up to protect&hellip;. As the former Labour speechwriter, Andrew Neather, put it, the policy was intended to &#8216;rub the right&rsquo;s noses in it&rsquo; and chastise them with the massed ovine bleat of &#8216;raaaaaacccist&rsquo; should they possibly object&hellip;. <br>
       &#8220;The same paper deliberately censored &#8216;emerging evidence&rsquo; of immigrants being involved in criminal gangs, fighting and mugging and begging&hellip;. [And] if there is one subject upon which the [BBC] is utterly incapable of a bipartisan approach, it is immigration&#8221; - Rod Liddle, The Spectator, October 1, p.17. <br>
       BUT (2) &#8220;Four out of five Brits think David Cameron will break his promise to slash immigration, a [YouGov] poll for The Sun reveals&#8221; (September 30).<br>
       Amren has shown great interest in Britain - have any US supporters any idea as to how the British people might replace the ruling Con-Lib-Lab carapace with statesmen they deserve?</p>

<p>Fair enough. But the fact is, Britain and not Ireland is Europe&rsquo;s No. 1 Islamist sleeper cell. Ask Homeland Security who they&rsquo;re more concerned about, Britain or Ireland.</p>
