<h1>Masters of the Universe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alex Kurtagic, September 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: This speech was delivered at a conference held by the <a href="https://www.thenationalpolicyinstitute.org/">National Policy Institute</a> in Washington, DC on September 10, 2011. In our opinion, it was the best and most interesting talk.</em>]</p>
<p>Two years ago I asked the question, &#8220;What will it take?&#8221;</p>
<p>How bad will it need to get, before the inconvenience of changing things becomes preferable to more of the same?</p>
<p>I asked this because for many years we&rsquo;d been hearing about a collapse that would cause a great uprising and magically solve all our problems.</p>
<p>The theory was that Whites in the West tolerated their displacement because they were too comfortable, because they felt prosperous, and risking their lifestyles by speaking out against multiculturalism, against racial quotas, against the slander coming from Hollywood and Madison Avenue, seemed not worth the trouble. </p>
<p>People found it easier to keep quiet and isolate themselves economically.</p>
<p>And in 2009 it seemed the collapse was about to happen. And yet, despite the biggest economic crisis in eighty years, life carried on just like before. </p>
<p>More immigration, more laws, more regulations, more surveillance, more bureaucracy, more political correctness, more money printing, and more and higher taxes to pay for it all. </p>
<p>Not only that, but elections were held afterwards, and the same politicians, with the same policies, were returned to power. </p>
<p>So the question remains, &#8220;What will it take?&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
<strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Those who have made it their mission to educate our fellow citizens. </p>
<p>Not only does the ideology of radical egalitarianism permeate all institutions of power, but this ideology is so entrenched as a quasi-religious orthodoxy as to be impermeable to reason.</p>
<p>No matter what facts or data or arguments are presented against this ideology, no matter what degree of perversion and corruption are revealed in association with the ideologues, no matter what obnoxious effects it has on the individual, it seems impossible to dislodge this ideology from the seats of power.</p>
<p>One can tell millions of citizens about the negative effects of diversity and multiculturalism, one can show them mountains of data, one can underline why and how this matters in a society, why and how it impacts on them personally, and many will openly or otherwise agree with what one says; but very few to speak in public against diversity and multiculturalism, and any statement is very quickly neutralised with accusations of racism. </p>
<p>Any debate about diversity and multiculturalism, let alone any debate about the reasons why it&rsquo;s important to have the debate, quickly degenerates into Byzantine discussions about whether or not something or someone is racist.</p>
<p>In education, those who go against the prevailing orthodoxy are systematically purged or marginalised. </p>
<p>And during elections we are presented with two or three nearly identical options, all founded on the same ideological principles. All with the same record of failure, all staffed by mediocre politicians, all infested with known liars, sell-outs, and opportunists. </p>
<p>And yet, even with everyone fed up with them, even with genuine alternatives available, the same two or three parties get voted into power election after election.</p>
<p>For over 100 years, people like us have been saying the same things, making the same arguments, presenting ever growing mountains of data, ever more facts to support our position; and yet for over 100 years, our camp has been in retreat, dwindling in numbers, losing influence, and growing ever more marginal.</p>
<p>Europe saw various revival movements during the first half of the 20th century.</p>
<p>But they were defeated politically and militarily. Much of the knowledge they produced was ignored, banned, maligned, or destroyed.</p>
<p>So the question arises, given what is happening to us, and given that the end product of the progressive egalitarian project is the end of us, what can we do to turn the tide? What must we do to alter the course of our society?</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Left Mysticism</strong></p>
<p>There are many reasons why we have not been more successful. </p>
<p>One of them is that certain ideas lost legitimacy after the last world war, even though those ideas were much bigger than any political movement.</p>
<p>Another reason is that loss of legitimacy resulted in a loss of access to institutional resources; it became more difficult for those ideas to look important. </p>
<p>And yet another reason was that as the equality zealots gained the ascendancy, they were able to use all of the institutional resources of the state to reconfigure how we see the world, how we learn about the world, and even how we think about the world. </p>
<p>And they also redeveloped the status system in our society, so that their ideas were elevated and enthroned, and those of their enemies scorned and reviled; so that their chums were promoted and praised to the skies, and their enemies demoted and ostracised as enemies of civilised society. </p>
<p>And through their control of institutions and the status system, they were able to encode their values and ideals. </p>
<p>Their values and ideas became a system of symbols. </p>
<p>And because symbols have emotional resonance, because they operate at the pre-rational level, at the emotional and instinctive level, the values and ideals of the Left became something a person felt, rather than something a person thought or thought about.</p>
<p>If we ask someone to explain how humans are equal, and if they&rsquo;re able to explain it at all, we get mantras, stock phrases, hearsay, and circular reasoning, but no real explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all human. We all bleed red. There&rsquo;s more genetic variation between individuals than there are between races.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not something a person actually thinks, or does any research on, it&rsquo;s something he overhears, something he feels is right, or ought to be right, because it feels good, and it feels good to be accepted in society, and it feels good to be seen as a good person.</p>
<p>And when we tell him that he&rsquo;s wrong, that humans are not equal, and he protests, it&rsquo;s not because he&rsquo;s done any research  &mdash;  in fact he doesn&rsquo;t want to look at the research  &mdash;  not unless it&rsquo;s convenient; it&rsquo;s because he feels it&rsquo;s morally wrong, or because he fears social sanction, disapproval, shame.</p>
<p>Thus the Left has mystified its values.</p>
<p>And through this mystification, the Left has made its system impervious to reason.</p>
<p>In doing so, its proponents effectively became the masters of our universe.</p>
<p>They set its boundaries, determined its laws, defined its appearance, and fixed its cosmological constants.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>The Messenger is the Message</strong></p>
<p>Thus those on our camp who have based their strategy for change on educating our fellow citizens, on presenting them with the facts and the arguments, have for the most part been confirming the views of people who are already agree with us.</p>
<p>Where there has been a conversion, most likely it&rsquo;s been because of some external factor.</p>
<p>The facts and the arguments don&rsquo;t go to the individual. The individual comes to the facts and the arguments.</p>
<p>The reason is that humans are rarely persuaded by facts and arguments. Rather they are impressed by their source.</p>
<p>In other words, the message is the messenger; and the messenger is the message.</p>
<p>This is why it&rsquo;s said that in a society the bulk of individuals follow whomever is in charge. Even when those in charge are hostile.</p>
<p>They are awed by their masters not because they are reasonable, but because they are powerful and masterful, because they control their universe, because they control access to status and resources, because they are dangerous, or else because they represent an idea that is seductive, that somehow inspires them.</p>
<p>And they are not likely to oppose their masters because deep down they want to be like them, they want to be among them, they want to have what they have, or they want to be part of that idea, they want to be with the winning team.</p>
<p>The only time they oppose their masters, or discard the idea is when they cease to seem masterful, when there&rsquo;s no longer a mystique around them, when they start looking weak and pathetic and all too human, when they look like they can be replaced  &mdash;  when something more seductive is on offer.</p>
<p>But the question remains: how did this hostile movement of proletarian anti-Traditionalism achieve mastery over our civilisation?</p>
<p>How did this hostile movement gain followers in the first place, not only among the rabble who stood to gain the most from their hatred of aristocracy, but also among the most able and the most intelligent, the ones who stood to lose the most? </p>
<p><br>
<strong>Love for Abstract Principles</strong></p>
<p>We speak of our society having been hijacked by organised minorities.</p>
<p>But the fact is this: their ideas of radical egalitarianism, of modernity, of progress, of globalism, as perverse as they may seem to some of us today, go with the grain of Western culture.</p>
<p>Western culture is individualistic, therefore Western man is not very ethnocentric. </p>
<p>He is less tribal, less racial, than other peoples of the world.</p>
<p>Likewise, Western culture is unique for its moral universalism, and Western man tends to become enamoured of abstract universal principles  &mdash;  liberty, equality, brotherhood, democracy, and so on.</p>
<p>Love for abstract principles is linked to a highly developed moral sense, which comes with a highly developed guilt complex.</p>
<p>Like all humans, Western man is tribal and has racial instincts, but they tend to put them aside in favour of principles, or individual utility  &mdash;  whatever they are at a given point in time and space. </p>
<p>For Western man, a much higher level of existential threat is needed to bring racial instincts to the surface.</p>
<p>So what we call White ethnomasochists don&rsquo;t see their actions as being against their racial or even their group interests; they see them as being moral, as being high minded. </p>
<p><br>
<strong>Reason Doesn&rsquo;t Motivate</strong></p>
<p>Humans, generally, are not motivated by rational self-interest.</p>
<p>Humans are motivated by the need to belong, and the need for status and self-esteem. </p>
<p>We want to fit into a community with whose members we identify and where we feel good about ourselves. </p>
<p>We are also motivated by inborn emotional tendencies. </p>
<p>And we humans also like to dream and fantasise, and are motivated by our own dreams and fantasies. </p>
<p>They may take the form of a religion, the form of a mythology, or art, or literature, or cosmology.</p>
<p>We dream and fantasise about what could be, about what ought to be, about how we would like to be.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s how we create meaning in our lives.</p>
<p>In the West, these daydreams often revolve around abstract principles.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Facts Don&rsquo;t Persuade</strong></p>
<p>At the same time there is too much information. </p>
<p>Too many sides to an issue, too many versions of the same story.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t have the time or the energy to research it, to try and discover the truth, to distinguish fact from fiction, knowledge from propaganda.</p>
<p>The result is that most choose the data that flatter their vanity, that make them feel good about themselves, that make them feel part of their chosen community.</p>
<p>And they reject data that seem inconvenient or embarrassing, or that come from a source with which they cannot personally identify. <br>
 <br>
Thus, if we are to be engaged in the most difficult project that can be attempted in a society, which is fundamentally to change the dominant ideology, to overthrow the ruling order, we have to begin by accepting our fellow citizens as they are, and not as we would like them to be.</p>
<p>In this case, we have to accept that the individual is not generally open to persuasion. Not unless he is already looking to be persuaded.</p>
<p>Most want to be confirmed in their beliefs. They don&rsquo;t want us to disrupt their world. </p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s no good saying &#8220;Oh, they need to wake up and smell the carcass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Humans will sooner keep on dreaming than wake up  &mdash;  after all, their dreams are nice and feel good, while reality is ugly and feels bad. </p>
<p>If we are to cause a change of allegiance, from one paradigm to another, we have to think in terms of seduction and inspiration. </p>
<p>As I noted before, humans are much more open to be inspired and seduced, than they are to be persuaded through facts and reason. </p>
<p>This is why when the Lindt company is trying to sell you chocolate, they don&rsquo;t tell you how it will meet your nutritional requirements for the day; they tell you it&rsquo;s going to make you feel good. Never mind how, or why. </p>
<p>Few care about the chemistry. </p>
<p>Few want the experience demystified with hard scientific facts.</p>
<p>This is not to say that reason, reality, or the facts, are not important, because they are. </p>
<p>But they are not a method of changing a person&rsquo;s mind. </p>
<p>They are a method of confirming a person whose mind is already made up, and probably made up since before he was born.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Positive Motivation</strong></p>
<p>So, how then, do we motivate our fellow citizens to proclaim an unconventional allegiance, with all the risks this entails?</p>
<p>Earlier I said that humans tend to be impressed by the masterful. </p>
<p>They come to an idea because the messenger is somehow seductive. </p>
<p>They want to be like him. Or with people like him.</p>
<p>I also said that they want to belong and to feel good about themselves.</p>
<p>If we are not being more successful selling our message, it&rsquo;s because we are offering none of the above.</p>
<p>Instead, many on our side offer an endless litany of complaints about how the world has gone wrong, about how we are in decline, about how we have less and less power in our society. </p>
<p>Anyone looking into our camp often sees wall-to-wall negativity, pessimism, fear, paranoia, despair, and lamentation.</p>
<p>It all amounts to one big, long wail of self-pity.</p>
<p>The despair is such that the mantra we often hear on the fringes of the Right is &#8220;worse is better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not because the people saying this have real solutions, but because they&rsquo;re hoping the collapse will fix everything.</p>
<p>That is not the attitude of the masterful, of the powerful, of people who shape events.</p>
<p>That is the attitude of people shaped by events. The attitude of a loser.</p>
<p>Defeatism is a prelude to defeat.</p>
<p>To succeed, we have to project an image of success.</p>
<p>That means getting rid of the negativity. </p>
<p>Speaking not in terms of what we&rsquo;ve lost; but in terms of what we&rsquo;re going to gain; in terms of what kind of society we want to build, in terms of what happens next, not what happened before.</p>
<p>A winner learns from the past, but he&rsquo;s always looking to the future. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s always facing the sun. And we are solar people. We have brought light into this world. We must not forget who we are. </p>
<p>We must not become slaves of the darkness.</p>
<p>A winner&rsquo;s image is an indispensable part of a winning formula. </p>
<p><br>
<strong>Alternative Society</strong></p>
<p>And a winning formula means acting as if.</p>
<p>Acting as if we are already there.</p>
<p>Which implies operating like an alternative society, offering access to a parallel universe, physical and metaphysical. </p>
<p>Access to a different cosmology, a different system of symbols, a different way of understanding life.</p>
<p>The new nationalism looks like an establishment in waiting.</p>
<p>Not like fearful cynics who are waiting for a collapse, but like people who are building something new and important, that makes the collapse desirable because it opens the way for what comes afterwards, because it opens the way for a golden age.</p>
<p>Rather than looking like conservatives fighting the tide of progress, we have to be the tide  &mdash;  the tide that sweeps away the old and decrepit left, that sweeps them out of power, sweeps them into the landfill of history, never to rise again.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Radical and Traditional</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a contradiction when some of us say that we are radical and traditional.</p>
<p>We are radical because we seek fundamental change  &mdash;  we&rsquo;re not looking for reforms; we&rsquo;re looking for something entirely new.</p>
<p>At the same time we are traditional, because our project is rooted in Tradition, even if it is futuristic.  </p>
<p>This is why we are not conservatives: conservatism is the negation of the new; Tradition is the ongoing affirmation of the old, of the archaic. And therefore it&rsquo;s endlessly regenerating. Constantly renewing.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Can Be Done</strong></p>
<p>Now, when some of us speak of transforming the culture, of reconfiguring it in order to make our politics possible, many are intimidated by the scale of the task.</p>
<p>It seems to them a godlike undertaking, more fantasy than reality.</p>
<p>But this is not so.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have to be too old to remember how our culture was reconfigured by the radical Left. </p>
<p>It has been done before. Within living memory.</p>
<p>How does one transform a culture?</p>
<p>The process begins very simply. </p>
<p>It begins with pen and paper, with brush and canvas, with a man and his musical instrument.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in the hands of a creative minority, who create because it&rsquo;s in their nature, because it&rsquo;s a compulsion, and because they are impatient with the world around them and dream of something else, they fantasise about something new.</p>
<p>The artist, the painter, the philosopher do what their nature compels them to do. </p>
<p>Over time there is a body of work. </p>
<p>Over time they meet others like themselves. </p>
<p>And they start having gatherings, and forming clubs and associations. </p>
<p>And in time these aggregate with others of a similar mould. </p>
<p>In time they develop into a current. In time they develop into a movement. And in time they emerge as a counter-culture. As a rival and competitor to the existing establishment.</p>
<p>This is when the struggle becomes political, and enters the political arena. </p>
<p>And it becomes a struggle between two opposing forces, two colliding cosmologies, two conceptions of the universe. One representing the past, another representing the future.</p>
<p>Only one of them becomes master of the universe.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Politics is the Last Stage</strong></p>
<p>You will notice that politics is the last stage. </p>
<p>This is why political parties like the BNP in Britain, the Front National in France, the NPD in Germany, remain marginal, despite the obvious failures of the Left. </p>
<p>Politics is the last stage. Politics reflects the culture. Politics is the art of the possible.</p>
<p>So our politics will not be possible until we control the culture. And because we don&rsquo;t control the culture we are in the period before politics. </p>
<p>The Left is approaching the period after politics, because their ideas have been dominant for a long time, and by now they have failed on every level. They are running on autopilot. </p>
<p>And now they are increasingly worried and desperate, because they can sense their own weakness, they can sense the boredom and the discontent seething underneath, the potential for a revolution. </p>
<p>They have failed aesthetically, criminologically, culturally, demographically, economically, politically, socially. They have failed on every front. </p>
<p>And by now they are vulnerable on all fronts.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>War on All Fronts</strong></p>
<p>This is why our project is a war on all fronts, and why it needs multiple angles of attack. </p>
<p>There is room for individuals of every inclination, man and woman, young and old, with different talents and abilities. Which means that anybody can wage the war in some way or another. </p>
<p>Some will do it as writers, others as artists, others as business people, others as protesters, others as patrons.</p>
<p>But to attract real talent we have to provide opportunities for talent. Which means business and professional opportunities. </p>
<p>Because in our economic era, being economically independent from the system, and having alternative sources of status recognition, means being intellectually and spiritually independent.</p>
<p>And to be attractive we have to be image conscious  &mdash;  because a picture speaks a thousand words. </p>
<p>If we want our fellow citizens to see, we have to help them visualise. </p>
<p>We have to show them what we mean, and we have to do it in less than a second. </p>
<p>Most people make up their minds about something or someone in less than a second. </p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t read a 400-page book. They won&rsquo;t even read an article. Not unless they&rsquo;ve already decided to do so.</p>
<p>What captures their attention is what resonates with them at the level of instinct, of emotion, at the animal level, at the spiritual level.</p>
<p>The way music resonates. The way a landscape resonates. The way a film resonates.</p>
<p>Man is the symbolising animal, he operates in symbols, structured sounds and images.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why a person&rsquo;s authority is instantly obvious. It&rsquo;s in the way he looks. The way he sounds. The way he carries himself.</p>
<p>Often he becomes a symbol of authority.</p>
<p>So to become masters of our universe once again, to rise as new masters as the old ones fall, a new nationalism needs to look like it deserves the sceptre of power. </p>
<p>It needs to symbolise a new beginning. And it needs to symbolise it now and always, and not wait for the collapse to clean the slate. </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know when that collapse will come, or what it will look like, or even if we&rsquo;ll notice it.</p>
<p>But if and when it does, it will clean the slate for everyone, for every competing group, and there are many others who are looking to have a bite at the cherry after the liberals are gone. </p>
<p>Islam is looking to dominate in Europe, and in the West. And Islamists are also hoping for a collapse.</p>
<p>We cannot expect a collapse to solve our problems. In fact, we shouldn&rsquo;t be focusing on the collapse at all. </p>
<p>We should be focusing on the world we want to see after the collapse, the world we want to see tomorrow. And we have to be building it today.</p>
<p>Because if and when that collapse comes, if we are not ready, if we are not there, looking like the world is ours for the taking, someone else will be, and they will become the masters of our universe.</p>
<p>Focusing on the world of tomorrow gives us an added advantage, which is the same advantage that the utopian Left enjoyed in years past: the advantage of having a sense of mission, a greater purpose. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a 9-5 job, where a person lives for the next weekend, for the next paycheque, dragged along by involution in the Kali-Yuga. It&rsquo;s about mastery over our lives, mastery over our destiny, mastery over our past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Being traditional also gives us an advantage that the Left doesn&rsquo;t have because they are anti-Tradition: the advantage of belonging, of being part of a community of people with whom we feel at home; of having a home and a family to which one can always return; of having a past and a future; of life with meaning, because we are part of something greater than ourselves, that is timeless and transcendental. </p>
<p>With the Left a person is always homeless, always a stranger, always a meaningless atom in a sea of Formica, PVC, neon, polyester, and reinforced concrete. </p>
<p>One final advantage is that the citizenry is fed up. </p>
<p>The individuals now in charge, in education, in the media, in politics, have amassed such a stupendous record of failure, have committed so many abuses, have lied and stolen so blatantly, that tax payers will be receptive to something new if they see something viable.</p>
<p>At the moment they keep voting the same politicians back into power because they are not impressed by the alternatives. They are choosing the least worse option.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not as if we are not given plenty of material to work with.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Concluding Remarks </strong></p>
<p>I would like to wrap this up by underlining the key ideas I would like you to take back at the end of this conference.</p>
<p>If you want to help bring about fundamental change, and are actively involved in the process, I ask that you incorporate in your approach a few basic principles: </p>
<p>One  &mdash;  think irrationally. Humans have the capacity for reason, but they use reason in irrational ways. </p>
<p>They often have irrational motivations, which they rationalise after the fact. But they are irrational. </p>
<p>So to reach our fellow citizens we have to understand their motivations, and not be irritated by them when they differ from ours.</p>
<p>We have anticipate their needs so that we can meet them, anticipate their fears so that we can dispel them, anticipate their desires so that we can fulfil them. Especially if they are irrational.</p>
<p>Two  &mdash;  impress to inform, don&rsquo;t inform to impress. </p>
<p>Often a person who sits through a speech doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to half of what is said, he remembers only one or two phrases, one or two concepts. And not for very long.</p>
<p>But when there is an able speaker the listener is nearly always impressed by the delivery, he likes the energy, he likes the emotions roused in him. Therefore he listens. </p>
<p>We often comment on the speaker, less on what he said.</p>
<p>So aim to be impression oriented, to be effect oriented.</p>
<p>Marketing and information campaigns are not about information. </p>
<p>They are about eliciting a reaction, inducing and maintaining a state of mind, opening the mind to an idea  &mdash;  among people who are overloaded with information, who don&rsquo;t want to be disturbed, who are wrapped up in their own lives.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why marketing and information campaigns aim to be iconic. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why they reduce everything to a soundbite, a slogan, an image, or a jingle that is infectious.</p>
<p>Facts are important, but at this stage they are subsidiary, because a mind remains closed so long as the spirit remains unmoved.</p>
<p>Three  &mdash;  think in pictures. Help people visualise what you are offering. A picture speaks a thousand words, and it&rsquo;s a lot easier to remember. And much more difficult to argue against because images resonate at an emotional and spiritual level. </p>
<p>Four  &mdash;  be positive. No one wants to be around a person who complains all of the time, who is always negative, who is always doom and gloom. Humans respond to optimism, because they want to feel good. </p>
<p>And our people in the West are crying out for a renaissance. So be positive, and focus on the future. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about where we came from and where we are going, not about where we are. </p>
<p>Five  &mdash;  enjoy the struggle. You will be more creative, and you&rsquo;ll have more energy, and you&rsquo;ll get more people interested in you, if you enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing. </p>
<p>Because if you enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing and you&rsquo;re good at it, you feel confident. And everyone likes that.</p>
<p>So think irrationally, impress to inform, think in pictures, be positive, and enjoy the struggle.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

		<p>I attended the NPI conference and heard this speech live. It truly was the best speech at the conference, and that&rsquo;s saying something, because the other speeches varied from good to excellent. This, however, was a GREAT speech. It must be heard (and preferably watched, with its accompanying slides) to get the full effect. Although Alex Kurtagic has been doing good work for several years in our cause, this speech, IMO, is &#8220;a star is born&#8221; moment.</p>
<p>The entire NPI conference, from the Press Conference on Friday, through the main conference on Saturday, and all the associated events and socializing which were connected to it, was a spectacular, inspiring, and much needed victory for our side.</p>
<p>I recommend you download THE POLITICAL CESSPOOL radio show, www.thepoliticalcesspool.org (archives) for Sept. 10th, and listen to James Edwards and his guests - Richard Spencer, Jared Taylor, and Sam Dickson - discuss what was going on. </p>
<p>And I wish you all could have been there.</p>

		<p>And what a tremendous and inspiring speech it was, fully deserving of its sustained standing ovation! Kurtagic is like a good doctor to this cause; he&rsquo;s always prepared with just the right medicine to move us forward.</p>

		<p>The most important thing is missing from this report.  There is no money to implement the plan for survival of the Whites.</p>
<p>The wealthiest entities in the country are against us.  It is Sears Roebuck, Heinz, Ford, GM, all the oil companies, the big super markets, Hyatt hotesl, Progressive insurance and almost all the wealthiest families and most prosperous companies tht fund the non profit foundations that sent Whites down the road to destruction.</p>
<p>Just one example; Thomas Ayers, father of Obama&rsquo;s handler for 30 years Bill Ayers weather underground founder and communist.</p>
<p>Thomas Ayers was CEO of Con Edison the main power company for Illinois and several other midwestern states.  He is a multi millionarie.  He serves on the boards of numerous major corporations.  </p>
<p>His Weather Underground communist revolutionary son Bill is and never was a rebel against his Father.  Thomas raised Bill to be a red diaper baby boomer. He was a close friend of communist Vernon Jarrett father-in-law of Obama&rsquo;s advisor Valerie Jarrett. He was also a friend of Frank Marshall Davis, Chicago communist who was Grandpa Stanley Dunham&rsquo;s best friend while Dunham was raising Obama in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Bernadette Dohrn is a law school graduate.  She cannot however be admitted to the Bar of any state because of her felony convictions related to her bombing activities as leader of the Weather Underground.  Yet as soon as she got out of prison she got a $100,000 a year job teaching as Northwestern University Law School.  How did she get that job?  Her father in law, Thomas Ayers, former CEO of Con Ed was also a member of the board of directors of Northwestern University. Northwestern BTW is known to be one of our most conservative universities.</p>
<p><br>
National Review used to publish annual lists of donors to SPLC/ACLU/NOW/NAACP/Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton&rsquo;s organizations and all the other organizations dedicated to the destruction of Whites.  They were the wealthiest corporations and families in America.</p>
<p>National Review also published lists of the members of the boards of directors of the biggest companies in America.  Many if not most also served on the boards of  NAACP/SPLC/ANNEBERG Foundation/NOW/Woods /Tides and the other anti White foundations.</p>
<p><br>
That is what we are fighting.  Billions and billions of dollars spent and available for more spending against Whites. The wealthy elites have combined with the blacks, hispanics, asians and criminal blacks to destroy Whites.</p>
<p>Most amremers know about this.  There is plenty of information on the internet and in libraries.  Start with Discover the Networks. Check out ACORN.  </p>
<p>All these ideas are excellent. But without the billions our enemies have nothing will happen.<br>

		<p>Excellent. This is exactly what we should be doing. One thing among many which we could do to make our cause more &#8220;attractive&#8221;, in the sense in which Mr. Kurtagic uses that word, is to stop denying what we are and what we believe in.</p>
<p>When accused, for example, of &#8220;racism&#8221; we should not deny it -  that immediately puts us in the wrong and appears weak and cringing. Instead we should respond with; &#8220;if it is racism, then racism can&rsquo;t always be bad can it?&#8221; or &#8220;you tell me what a racist is and I&rsquo;ll tell you whether or not I am one&#8221; or &#8220;OK so it&rsquo;s racist, tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>This always wrong foots the left which can&rsquo;t handle people who refuse to meet them on their own chosen ground, and it looks strong: combine that with a positive vision of an ethnostate founded on radical traditionalism and more and more will be attracted into the fold, and more and more will all of the left&rsquo;s positions be seen as the hollow shams which they are.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;So, how then, do we motivate our fellow citizens to proclaim an unconventional allegiance, with all the risks this entails?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m right when I say that it isn&rsquo;t possible to ignite a fire intense enough to reverse a mindset that is the norm in every Western country no matter what kind of tactics, psychology or methods are used.</p>
<p>If we ever get back to homogeneity it will be ONLY after widespread internecine conflict, breaking along lines of race and ethnicity&hellip;and to a much smaller degree&hellip;.politics.</p>
<p>And this conflict will not be embarked upon via any kind of persuasive rhetoric, power or mastery displayed by anybody.  It will come about because there is no way to avoid it. It will be a final act of desperation, frustration and rage.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m certain it will come.</p>

		<p>FINALLY;<br>
Thanks for a step in the right direction. I have long wished AR had a discussion area, where posters and members could speak constructively. I know this is not the focus of AR, and I&rsquo;m grateful AR does this work to &#8220;bring the darkness to light,&#8221; as it were. <br>
This is a vital first step.<br>
But since once seeing the world for what it is, we can only get more bitter, if all we do is see yet more examples of the lunacy and lies.<br>
Here is a great start, and it gave me timely advice; to remember to move forward as though I cannot fail, or at least as though I mean it. With optimism for what CAN be achieved, rather than sorrow for what no longer can be.<br>
I hope this sparks a new direction for AR, or at least a sidestream, where we can constructively plan, move forward, and build the world we must build. This moping is a killer&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Europe saw various revival movements during the first half of the 20th century. But they were defeated politically and militarily&#8221;.<br>
Presumably the author is referring to Nazism, which would fit with his elevation of &#8216;will&rsquo; and &#8216;instinct&rsquo;, his disdain for rational argument, and his apparent conviction that the masses should be manipulated by &#8216;masters&rsquo;. How can the author of that sober, rational and persuasive book White Identity admire this?</p>

		<p>Very good speech.</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles we face is that most whites believe the races are equal not because of scientific evidence but simply because they want to. It just seems right.</p>
<p>As Kurtagic notes, when you try to show them evidence to the contrary they look away as if you&rsquo;re showing them hardcore porn.</p>

		<p>This speech provides good analysis of the past and present, but Kurtagic&rsquo;s long-winded solution for the future is not really there. I am a dedicated whiner and loser because I resent having lost my society and doubt I&rsquo;ll get it back in my lifetime. </p>
<p>But on the positive side, when China had its Great Leap Forward, inspired by Mao&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s, that nation was back on its feet within about ten years. Change and a better future will be driven not by political action but because the system becomes grossly dysfunctional and the power players lose their luster. And by the nature of things, the replacement of the system will tend to be reactionary.<br>

		<p>This is a very good speech, and has given me ideas to think about. This article is filed under Signs of Hope and I have a small one to share.</p>
<p>They quit teaching the German language at my daughters High School some years back because of lack of interest. They brought it back this year and the class quickly filled up. I remember at open house when we stopped by to meet my daughters German teacher, there were several students there and they were full of questions about Germany, and talking about their German ancestors with pride. It made me feel so good knowing they are not ashamed or embarrassed even with all the propaganda telling them they should be. It&rsquo;s those little things that give me hope. That German class has become one of my daughters favorites, and she says they have a blast every day. She&rsquo;s making excellent progress with the language too!</p>

		<p>This is a call for more creativity in bringing white people together. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about a way for our people to make money while connecting with whites. I like the tried and true American specialty - the door to door salesman; like Avon, Amway, Encyclopedia Britannica, Mary Kay. Our people will sell white products and services; magazine subscriptions, memberships, book and music monthly clubs. There is already enough product out there to get going. With increasing market more items can be added. How about a directory of local white businesses even if only three pages stapled together? Salesmen will need some training as they will be talking to potential converts to the white movement. </p>

		<p>Here is one practical thing you might consider, at least where you can buy bullion coins easily and cheaply. Change half of your dollars into silver and gold ounce coins. When you are certain you are dealing with other Caucasian race realists (this assumes getting to know each other, or, having some way of identifying each other), use only silver and gold for your trade with each other. When dealing with all others, use the fiat currency.</p>
<p>Over time, and if enough people join in, wealth will accumulate on our side.</p>

		<p>A big difference between us and the Weimar Republic is that America possesses an urban &lsquo;diversity&rsquo; that has become completely dependent on a large functioning central government. When this central government falls apart, 3rd World ethno-centricity among peoples who have been conditioned to riot at the drop of a hat will be their collective weakness, not their strength.</p>
<p>The last few years have proven that a critical mass of Americans can be brought together and motivated to action by the symbols and positive ideas of our Founding. For every naïve type you find in the Tea Party groups, you find another who is grounded in reality. The next version of flash mobs should knock some sense into the casual observers. </p>
<p>Until then, there is a lot of work to be done at the barbeques.</p>

		<p>I believe this is true. People are moved by symbols. This does come off as a truly great speech. We are a counter culture; the left had experience with this back in their early days, now it is up to us to learn this art. We need to remove the msm&rsquo;s sense of legitimacy to the people. When people see that something is from wikipedia or cnn they think that it is valid; we must show them that it is not. Metapedia and metacafe are alternatives.  What would people do if suddenly they did not receive television signals anymore? What would they do if MSNBC stopped broadcasting?</p>

<p>I say do nothing!! That is right. Do nothing. </p>
<p>Todays victims are tomorrows reactionaries. I would almost say support the other side. It will take many more flash mobs, white girls getting raped, white men loosing their job, college students being displaced by immigrants to really make any change. </p>
<p>Just keep a presence and the victims will come to us. And sad to say that will even be less than 50% as many victims still will believe in the lies of the left. </p>

		<p> #7  Assuming you&rsquo;re not being disingenuous,you need to read some books explaining the concept of cultural hegemony and situating it in the context of the West&rsquo;s current crisis. I suggest two books by Paul Gottfried: &#8220;Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt&#8221; and &#8220;The Strange Death of Marxism: The European Left in the New Millennium.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the time being, an old article by the late Marxist Paul Piccone  may be of help:<br>
https://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/piccone_ulmen.htm<br>
(..)<br>
<i>Thus, competing systems such as Nazism, fascism and communism  &mdash;  and now even Islamic integralism  &mdash;  are not only systematically misinterpreted, but, like liberalism, also universalized as permanent threats to a managerial liberalism hypostatized as the natural outcome of evolution and, therefore, as normal and natural. This is why such political thinkers as Schmitt, whose work was always inextricably rooted in problematic historical contexts, (6) can still be perceived as an ideological threat, long after those concrete historical situations have faded into the past. Because for a time he was opportunistically embroiled in Nazi politics, and the new American anti-Schmittians see Nazism and fascism not as closed chapters of 20th century history, but rather as permanent threats to liberalism, Schmitt&rsquo;s ideas are interpreted as something that must be eliminated, rather than as challenges to be confronted.</i></p>
<p><i>In fact, the demonization of Schmitt is instrumentalized to defend the status quo and predominant relations of domination. Assumed to be the best of all possible systems, the existing managerial framework, run by a New Class elite, legitimates itself as the only bulwark of Western values by opposing all competing alternatives  &mdash;  equally rooted in the Western tradition  &mdash;  as lethal threats to its own interpretation of progress and emancipation. During the Cold War, the de facto permanent state of emergency contributed to the academic institutionalization of this state of affairs, which persists long after both Nazism and fascism (and, after 1989, even communism) have been vanquished.</i><br>
(&hellip;)<br>
<i>Although defined by the Cold War, the postwar years were also characterized by an American administration attempting to fine-tune the New Deal  &mdash;  a collectivist project of socio-economic reconstruction that had been strengthened considerably by war mobilization, but remained unable to legitimate itself fully on the basis of those deep-rooted Protestant values of decentralized governance and local self- determination embedded in the US Constitution. Consequently, with the gradual shift from isolationism to imperialism and from classical to managerial liberalism, which had begun toward the end of the 19th century, but had stalled temporarily in the 1920s (in reaction to WWI), American historiography broke with its traditional exceptionalism.</i></p>
<p><i>What took its place was a slight variation of the unilinear theory of history espoused by its managerial-liberal and, even more, its former communist opponents. The &#8220;pursuit of happiness,&#8221; previously left to the discretion of particular communities, was redefined in terms of full and equal participation in a well-administered, professionalized society (a euphemism for socialism and social homogenization), projected as the inevitable outcome of all historical developments. As with all secularized versions of the Christian theory of history, deviations from such a path came to be seen as pathologies or breaks, rather than as legitimate alternatives.</i></p>
<p><i>On the ideological level, there was a general homogenization of American and European history, which made possible a transposition of European experiences to interpret American realities, and vice-versa. Thus, legitimate political projects concerned with defending traditions and organic social relations, such as those of most branches of American conservatism, were uncritically associated with brutally repressive modernizing ideologies, such as fascism and Nazism, which instrumentalized pseudo-traditions and mythical communities to gain power and legitimacy. Successfully ghettoized by the dominant universalist managerial framework, these legitimate political projects were systematically discredited as obstructions to progress and collective emancipation. (10) Although in economic matters they were mostly 19th century laissez-faire liberals, American conservatives who opposed the New Deal&rsquo;s centralization, homogenization, and planning (and, of course, the regulation and containment of capitalism) came to be practically criminalized. <br>

<p>Not true #3. Bernadette Dohrn was a admitted to the New York bar. There may be other states which admit felons to the bar, however incongruous that may sound to you. The idea behind this, I presume, was to allow people from troubled backgrounds to eventually become normal members of society. Speaking for myself, I am not impressed by people who want to rely on disenfranchising others. Otherwise I agree with much of what you say. </p>

		<p>There will be no great white awakening.  Ice and Preston are spot on; we&rsquo;re much better off flying under the radar and waiting for the inevitable collapse of our civilization when the egalitarian socialist do-gooders finally run out other people&rsquo;s money and the leeches who&rsquo;s growth has far outstripped nature&rsquo;s ability to support them cut each others&rsquo; throats.</p>
<p>Frankly, if Ron Paul (my own personal last hope) doesn&rsquo;t get the Republican nomination I will buck the trend and begin voting for the GREATER of two evils in an effort to keep the Kenyan in the White House.  With no re-election to look forward to he&rsquo;ll drop all pretenses and fully become the unabashed Red we all know him to be. The phoney rush to the center as the polls approach will be only a memory, and I fear we&rsquo;ll long for the days of &#8220;yes we can&#8221; hubris in the wake of the election of the first half-white ambiguous-citizenship foreign-educated black-because-it&rsquo;s-politically-expedient president, compared to what&rsquo;s in store.</p>
<p>Keep your powder dry, stock up on your essentials, and ready the popcorn because you&rsquo;re going to witness the collapse of the greatest civilization ever known, the first in history to literally GIVE ITSELF AWAY without a shot fired.</p>
<p>Too many here are focused on halting the downward progress.  That ship has sailed.  We need to focus on clearing the rubble and rebuilding when the wool is finally yanked from the eyes of the survivors.  Our moment has not yet arrived.</p>

		<p>&#8220;For over 100 years, people like us have been saying the same things, making the same arguments, presenting ever growing mountains of data, ever more facts to support our position&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the whole problem.  One cannot sway the rabid fanatics with logic because they are immune to it.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Not only does the ideology of radical egalitarianism permeate all institutions of power, but this ideology is so entrenched as a quasi-religious orthodoxy as to be impermeable to reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the crux of the aforementioned problem.  I&rsquo;d drop the quasi- and just call it what it is, a religion, a matter of faith, not reason.  There is only one cure for this.  The idea must die in order to be replaced with another.  Breivik understood this, but he attempted to force it which rightly causes people to recoil in fear.  Nobody will sign on to an ideology bathed in blood and forged in violence.</p>
<p>That is not the case however if the idea is not a component of the bloodshed.  And that violence is sure to come as our civilization slowly descends deeper into dysfunction and degeneracy.  Not the best analogy because I am in no way a proponent of national socialism, but Hitler came to power when the German people felt they had no other alternative.  He made them feel pride in themselves after the hardships and shame imposed on them post-Versailles.  If he had gone out from the outset and said he was going to kill those the Nazis considered undesirable he never would have ascended to power.</p>
<p>Our people need to know REAL pain and hardship before they&rsquo;re going to come over to our side in large numbers.  But if it&rsquo;s people with our ideas that cause that pain (Breivik for example) it&rsquo;s going to ruin our cause forever.  Radical egalitarianism must come crashing spectacularly to the ground all on its own. </p>

		<p>I agree with others here that the impact of this speech is best felt if viewed live (as I did at the conference) or at least through video. Kurtagic both speaks of the necessity of inspiration and style while employing the same in his delivery.</p>
<p>The swaying of our pendulum towards creativity and feeling away from excessive rationalism and dependency on reasoned arguments will &#8220;seduce&#8221; more whites into giving our excellent ideas and criticisms a fair hearing. The questions we all have to ask ourselves is: with my talents and abilities, what can I do creatively to help the rebirth of our people? What further things can I learn so that I will be more creative, more sophisticated, more professional?</p>

<p>The other day we were asked to participate in the funeral of a local Air Force Staff Sergeant who was killed when a Chinook helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan a few weeks ago.  </p>
<p>While making our arrangements in the office at the cemetery, I noticed a bulletin posted that listed the days of emphasis for the cemetery this year.  </p>
<p>Now, one might think that they might focus on the different branches of the military, or the different conflicts in which those buried had served. But of course that&rsquo;s not the case. </p>
<p>There were nine of them, each lasting about a month.  The nine in no particular order. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing this since 1970.  Things have just gotten worse and worse.  I&rsquo;m sure that Ukranian peasants in 1925, German Jews in 1935 and English Catholics in 1540 were saying the exact same things.</p>

		<p>That was awesome! That was a perfect manifesto on the correct attitude, approach and method of achieving our well-found desires! It is so true!</p>
<p>The base fundamentals must be rightly set before more complex and convoluted challenges are to be tackled.</p>
<p>Mighty rivers flow from a small source. Our source must then be where water will gather and flow.</p>
<p>Tradition is not the opposite of the left, it is the opposite of anti-tradition. We should call it anti-tradition. Let them go against George Washington and Ben Franklin.</p>
<p>Tradition is hyped as an affront to egalitarianism. But the &#8220;left&#8221; destroyed &#8220;itself&#8221; (whatever it ever was). No one believes it was the &#8220;right.&#8221; Therefore attacks on tradition are cynical.</p>
<p>If the &#8220;left&#8221; is paired with egalitarianism, which is really selective anti-tradition, what is Tradition paired with?</p>
<p>Authenticity? Worth? Reality? Meaning? Spirit? Truth? Honor? Peace? Freedom?</p>
<p>Pick one.</p>
<p>If left &#8220;egalitarianism&#8221; succeeded on a myth, Traditionalism needs a mythical rationale, and I am not sure that it can be anti-left or anti- anything. Egalitarianism, as a promulgated idea, certainly wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But unlike egalitarianism, Tradition&rsquo;s myth must be real. It must keep its promise to whom it makes one.</p>
<p>Why? Because &#8220;Left&#8221; and it&rsquo;s egalitarianism and &#8220;Right&#8221; and it&rsquo;s current miasma of &#8220;conservative&#8221; postures are certainly controlling dialogues and outcomes for the people that control the outlets of information.</p>
<p>Left and right is meaningless to them. Power is everything. The failure of one or the other does not matter and never did. They don&rsquo;t care how we feel, although they said they did.</p>
<p>Just as the current &ldquo;left&rdquo; and the current &ldquo;right&rdquo; do not matter to the controllers, neither will the does the next thing. They will cynically manipulate the movement at every opportunity.</p>
<p>If we have already lost by losing perhaps we can win by already have won.</p>
<p>They have the current on top of the ocean but we have the ocean. The American ocean belongs to Americans if it belongs to anyone. When it comes down to it our place is secure. Act like it.</p>
<p>There is your attitude.<br>

		<p>There are plenty of forums for us to talk constructively, even if we have to talk in code to keep Big Brother from taking preemptive measures against our progress. I like the idea of gold and silver coins between us. I don&rsquo;t accept fed reserve note fiat currency for my business. I don&rsquo;t own an official business that the irs can watch.<br>
 The speech is right: we are far too pessimistic (particularly anons 23 and 24, among others), and we need to use our natural creativity to our mutual benefit. I am a fiber artist. If you buy things from me, it will NEVER say &#8220;made in china&#8221;. <br>
I also like &#8216;john bell in england&rsquo;s  &#8220;so it is &#8220;racist&#8221;, tough&#8221; stance. These are the things we believe and we have every right to live accordingly and have our interests recognized and respected. Our opinions matter too!<br>
White Advocate is right about where we need to start, with a directory of all in the White Enterprises project.<br>
Language, religion, Writings, poetry, song &amp; music, dance, dress and customs, food, crafts and arts; these are the stuff of cultures. What we need is like a magazine and catalog, articles in various sections and letters from readers and lists of stuff to buy. Our politics are &#8220;what is good for our people&#8221;. <br>
 We musn&rsquo;t be pessimistic about this. 28anon, I don&rsquo;t think that that is true; I am blonde but I don&rsquo;t sneer at brunes. My mom is a brunette.</p>

		<p>Traditional religion is the answer.  As Hilaire Belloc said: Europe is the faith [Catholic faith] and the faith is Europe.  Not the false faith taught since Vatican Council 2 but that of the Council of Trent.  </p>
<p>Oh, by the way; it has the added advantage of being the truth as given by God and will stand-up to the onslaught of Mohammedanism</p>

		<p>I agree with his diagnosis. For over 100 years or more we&rsquo;ve become more liberal with it being bizarre and unopposed for the last 50 years or so; verging on being a parody. But it goes on. Today&rsquo;s conservative agenda resembles nothing so much as yesterday&rsquo;s liberal agenda. Witness gays in the military. Only 20 years ago the conservatives were against &#8216;don&rsquo;t ask don&rsquo;t tell&rsquo;. Now the conservative position is to be for it. The nation has gotten worse by most measurable standards. I believe in his prediction too. The center will move toward the right in the future, perhaps for a good 100 years of it&rsquo;s own. It&rsquo;s not about left or right, however. At least not for us and for our efforts. Most of us are on the right but we shouldn&rsquo;t ignore those on the left. It&rsquo;s about doing what&rsquo;s best for whites, for a change. Whites, speaking up for whites, or even for themselves&hellip; they need to join the cacophony of voices those in power say we need to hear from so badly.    </p>

		<p>Mr. Kurtagic makes some hugely important points.  He illustrates those points in the style of his presentation.</p>
<p>But between now, when the alternative, race-realist right consists mostly of widely scattered, very loosely connected individuals, and the time when &ldquo;we&rdquo; (loosely speaking) participate in a visible counter-culture (I&rsquo;m not talking about a mass movement), it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that a small percentage of intelligent, educated people <i>can</i> be reached by reason, logic and facts.  Maybe it&rsquo;s only one person out of every thousand, or out of every ten thousand, but such people are out there.  Efforts to reach these people are worthwhile.  We&rsquo;re not recruiting for a mass movement, we&rsquo;re &ldquo;recruiting&rdquo; future participants in a counter-culture from which the leadership of a mass movement might emerge, whether or not a total collapse of society forces us and everyone else to rethink our positions.</p>
<p>We should also keep in mind that sometimes events take place that render some people more receptive to alternative viewpoints.  For example, consider the young female student at a branch of the University of California who posted a slightly tasteless video criticizing the behavior of some Asian students in the university library.  The &ldquo;event&rdquo; was the left&rsquo;s huge, opportunistic hate-fest that followed.  In the middle of all that, Jared Taylor posted an open letter to the student on AmRen.  Because people were actively talking and thinking about the grotesquely disproportionate response to the incident, I&rsquo;m sure Taylor&rsquo;s letter was much more effective than the average alternative right blog post.  Maybe he reached five out of every thousand (or ten thousand) people.  There was no resulting mass movement, but in our present situation, these &ldquo;small&rdquo; numbers (whatever they actually are) are very significant.</p>

		<p>The speaker is right on. Appeals to logic and common sense are useless when the enemy has a treasure trove of raw emotion to draw on. Along with race realism, another example of this phenomenon is the futile attempts at &#8220;counter-recruiting&#8221; of young adults to keep them out of the military. Nearly a year ago at Antiwar.com I explained why the effort has failed and suggested how it might succeed in the future; you can read my post <a href="https://original.antiwar.com/justin/2010/10/07/support-the-troops/#IDComment103109271" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If we can turn our enemies into objects of ridicule and scorn, victory is at hand.</p>
<p>The speaker also mentions the power of symbols. The SVP in Switzerland has done a spectacular job in that regard. They&rsquo;ve come up with posters like <a href="https://iamnotarapperispit.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/amd_svp_poster.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="https://justbcynical.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/svp_01a.jpg" rel="nofollow">this one </a>to win national referendums. Several months ago <a href="https://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/180878_10100160745761033_3206550_53932833_3450658_n.jpg" rel="nofollow">this graphic</a> was instrumental in defeating a gun-grab referendum. Maybe we can bring those SVP artists here to teach our artists a thing or two.</p>
<p>To Anonymous (#3): Money is great, but it isn&rsquo;t the ultimate decider. Plenty of political campaigns have gone down in flames despite outspending their opponents by 10-1 or more. Two thumbs up for gold and silver, but don&rsquo;t forget the other precious metal   &mdash;   lead. The 2nd Amendment is our ultimate trump card, provided we&rsquo;re willing to use it if necessary.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;For over 100 years, people like us have been saying the same things, making the same arguments, presenting ever growing mountains of data, ever more facts to support our position&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The basis for todays deniers of truth is their attachment to ideology. By reverence and loyalty to the case, facts gets ignored as they are so small compared the great aim. And then we also forget that what we call facts are usually still subject to faith, or at least trust. <br>
Whatever fact that we cannot prove for ourselves, but have been proven by others like the press, is actually in the zone of belief. That we trust the newspaper or the journalist is mostly ignored. But it explains why a simple fact cannot be regarded as powerful in just itself.</p>
<p>I therefore disagree with Kurtagic`s pessimistic attitude towards of reason. I rather think that this movement will grow and create a flood of facts, which one day will tear down most of the politics based upon superstitious dreaming. Because i believe there is a critical mass factor connected to facts ability to change peoples view of the world.  Also; if we don`t respect reason and facts, any change in power will still be disabled in realism.<br>

		<p>There was good and bad in fascism and national socialism, and rational and objective minds are needed to sort out which was which in terms of human decency and on the basis of accurate information. Same applies to Stalinism, or any other politics.<br>
The case for &#8220;white nationalism&#8221; needs to be made afresh, and to anticipate and controvert every predictable counter-&#8220;argument&#8221; and counter-measure.  Any &#8220;Jewish&#8221; aspect needs the most careful, well-informed and nuanced analysis - much of the pre-war anti-racist stuff from that quarter was to help with immigration into the USA and much of the post-war was &#8220;never again&#8221; precaution after Hitler. (&#8220;We never feel secure until we are supreme&#8221; [Rabbi Hugo Gryn, a &#8220;Holocaust survivor&#8221;].) Does it matter that much if the turnaround among Jews, from communism to zionism, and the recent vigorous opposition to multi-cultural immigration from some of them (e.g. Melanie Phillips and the late Alfred Sherman in the UK) is self-interest against Arab Islamism and Black violence, so long as we stay allies on the mutual issue - they don&rsquo;t feel threatened by neo-nazi genocide, but we don&rsquo;t let them run the whole show?<br>
Kevin MacDonald, John Glad, Paul Gottfried, Richard Lynn, Pascal Bruckner and Robert Wistrich all have something - however different - to contribute, but none of them has a monopoly of insight. <br>
Let&rsquo;s keep focussed on our main target, to preserve a future for western civilisation in an overcrowded world.<br>
This needs operation at every level of society, if possible, just like the old Communist Party, its infiltrators and fronts.  Both rational argument AND emotional appeal, and the subtle subversion of current fashions like environmentalism and group-rights theory, are needed.<br>

<p>They say stupidity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different result.

		<p>I can see that taking his advice and look to the future is good advice, as well as a presumption of success.  However, if you are losing your job, barred from employment, negated in various ways on a daily basis, one has to do much future focusing.  I think that the main war against whites is being waged in the present.  Focusing too much on the future and smiling along as if goals are already accomplished will just add to the lack of realism that most whites are engaged in today.  Not preparing for a total collapse in the face of groups that are calling for a war on whites, is hugely unrealistic.  </p>
<p>Many good points made here, but why didn&rsquo;t he just name eugenics rather than allow readers to imagine he might be saying that Nazis had the answers?  If we focus on all the genetic research that now makes the value of eugenics clear, a great deal of harm being done to the white race could be addressed.  We ought to use the science that supports us, not rail on our precious religious traditions, etc.  Chat up the science everywhere.  This is a huge potential front and all the hard weaponry is ours to use.</p>

		<p>Jason Robertson: I would be interested to know the source attributing the quotation &ldquo;We never feel secure until we are supreme&rdquo; to Rabbi Hugo Gryn. I don&rsquo;t know if he said it or what the context was, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound at all characteristic of him. </p>

		<p>People are moved by emotion because the magnetic field around the heart is something like 3,000 to 5,000 stronger than the magnetic field around the brain. The electrical charge of the brain is equal to a bowl of Jello. </p>
<p>It is wise for us to learn how to power the force of the ideas that come from our mind with the power of our heart.</p>

		<p>The quote from the late Hugo Gryn appeared in The Jewish Chronicle (London) some years ago and stuck in my memory for the very reason that probably prompts my questioner.  Just possibly synonyms were used for &#8220;secure&#8221; and &#8220;supreme&#8221; but the import of his sentence, in context, was exactly as I remember it, and in my view a candid observation (unlike his bizarre account of stumbling upon a &#8220;gas-chamber&#8221; while playing when a young inmate in the Auschwitz &#8220;family camp&#8221;). I have the article somewhere in boxes of unsorted cuttings, but it could presumably be traced from TJC archives.  I had a soft spot for this &#8220;Moral Maze&#8221; pundit (who resembled a boyhood friend named Fishman) as also for the late Chaim Bermant and the currently &#8220;punctual&#8221; Geoffrey Alderman.<br>
You may know the joke about the Jewish lecturer who told his audience that, contrary to anti-semitic propaganda, &#8220;The only thing we Jews have in common is that we disagree with one another.&#8221; &#8220;I disagree,&#8221; shouted a heckler. <br>
Give me Woody Allen (&#8220;They used to call it a &#8216;Jew&rsquo;s harp&rsquo; but you know these people, the slightest hint of anti-semitism and they write letters&#8221;) rather than Abe Foxman any day.</p>

		<p>Here is the SPLC report on the NPI conference</p>
<p>Friday, September 9, 2011, at 1:30 pm sharp, in the wood-paneled precincts of National Press Club, the National Policy Institute&rsquo;s press conference begins. </p>
<p>The occasion is the release of its report &ldquo;The Majority Strategy: Why the GOP Must Win White America.&rdquo; Most of the 100 or so seats are taken; surprisingly enough, given the provocative topic, only one non-white face is in evidence.</p>
<p>The National Policy Institute presents itself to the world as a think tank along the lines of the Heritage Institute or the Brookings Institution. But as tweedy as its representatives may seem, its Mission Statement reveals that it has a great deal in common with groups who wore very different sorts of costumes to their meetings &mdash; which were often held by torchlight.</p>
<p>America is neither &ldquo;based on a creed&rdquo; nor &ldquo;derived from a proposition,&rdquo; its Statement of Principles declares, but is rather &ldquo;the unique and irreplaceable product of centuries of specific racial, historical, and cultural identities.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That identity is white and European and can endure &ldquo;only so long as the identities that created it and sustain it endure.&rdquo; In short, &ldquo;the perfectibility, let alone the equality, of man is not possible and is not a legitimate political aspiration. </p>
<p>Political efforts to achieve or enforce perfectibility and equality invariably demand an unacceptable degree of coercion and result in unnecessary and unjust pain, suffering, and social disorder.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Most of that pain and suffering is felt by white people, which is why the National Policy Institute (NPI) calls itself &ldquo;the right&rsquo;s answer to the Southern Poverty Law Center.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NPI&rsquo;s executive director Richard Spencer, the author of the report, spoke first; he was followed by James Edwards, the host of the premier white nationalist radio show, Political Cesspool, and author of Racism, Schmacism, and Jared Taylor, whose newest book is White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century. VDARE&rsquo;s Peter Brimelow was an announced speaker, but had been detained by a family emergency.</p>
<p>The gist of NPI&rsquo;s report is that the Republican Party is already &ldquo;effectively the White People&rsquo;s Party,&rdquo; with 90 percent of its votes cast by whites. A winning strategy would be to &ldquo;reach in&rdquo; to its majority base rather than &ldquo;reach out&rdquo; to minorities. </p>
<p>Instead of shirking its identity the GOP should embrace it by advocating immigration restriction, an end to civil rights and hate crime legislation, and to all forms of affirmative action.</p>
<p>In the broader view, if America is allowed to become a white minority country, conservativism will lose its meaning, as there will be no country left to preserve. On the pragmatic side, why can&rsquo;t Republicans see that restricting immigration will reduce their rivals&rsquo; constituency? </p>
<p>By embracing the false ideal of an inclusive multiculturalism, they are insuring not only their own political destruction but the destruction of their whole civilization. Would India allow the Japanese to elect its leaders? Would Han Chinese allow South Carolinians to elect theirs? </p>
<p>Then how can Republicans sit by and allow non-white Americans, who don&rsquo;t&rsquo; even identify with white American values, to re-elect Barack Obama? If they don&rsquo;t wake up, they will &ldquo;become like the Whigs of old and end up in the ash can of history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taylor and Edwards both hammered home the theme that white people&rsquo;s greatest liability is their fear of being called racists. Non-whites and liberals have no such compunctions: they hate whites and white culture; by not standing up for their own interests, whites are hastening the day when they&rsquo;ll become a hated minority themselves. </p>
<p>Not that minorities are hated today &mdash; far from it. They&rsquo;re coddled and pandered to and are the recipients of billions of wasted dollars of largesse. It&rsquo;s natural to look after one&rsquo;s own interests, they say. They do it. Why aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>The Q&A; was brief but had a few telling moments. When asked why Republicans refuse to recognize their own interests, Sam Dickson rose from the audience and declared that John McCain had been selfish and anti-social all his life; Richard Spencer noted that Democracies tend to &ldquo;self-select sociopaths&rdquo; to govern themselves. </p>
<p>When a member of the audience asked how they reconcile individualism with the return to tribalism that they seem to espouse, Jared Taylor explained that individualism is a white Protestant value and that the only way to protect it is to preserve the white Protestant tribe. America is not a proposition nation, Taylor pointed out; its essential identity comes from blood and soil.</p>
<p>When someone asked if it wasn&rsquo;t true that brainy immigrants help keep us competitive in technology, another member of the audience put in his own two cents. &ldquo;I was in Silicon Valley in the &lsquo;80s,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;And let me tell you, there weren&rsquo;t a lot of Asians there. And the Asians that were there were just average engineers. </p>
<p>We landed on the moon without immigrants. We don&rsquo;t need them.&rdquo; Spencer pointed out that while there is scientific evidence that Asians in fact excel at abstract reasoning, it is European whites who invent great things.</p>
<p>When the lone African American in the room rose to ask a question, the panel fell all over themselves to assure him that they don&rsquo;t hate minorities. Blacks enjoy a higher standard of living in the US than they do anywhere else in the world; why isn&rsquo;t there more gratitude?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no hatred in my heart,&rdquo; Edwards declared. &ldquo;All we want is the freedom to associate only with our own kind, to not be forced to deal with you,&rdquo; Taylor reassured him. &ldquo;Private discrimination, the &lsquo;refusal-to-deal,&rsquo; is a recognized legal principle.&rdquo;</p>
