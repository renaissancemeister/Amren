			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>National Post, September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Universite de Montreal is investigating alleged racism on campus after a group of white students was filmed wearing blackface during a frosh activity on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Anthony Morgan, who filmed the incident, told the Montreal Gazette the activity was meant to raise awareness of activities on campus and that the students in blackface were encouraging people to join a track and field club. They can be seen waving Jamaican flags, chanting: &#8220;Smoke some weed! Yeah mon! Yeah mon!&#8221; in the footage Morgan posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was never something I expected to see in Montreal, much less on a university campus,&#8221; Morgan told the Gazette. &#8220;Being black and of Jamaican descent myself it was just completely jarring. It was humiliating as though your race is somehow a costume for buffoonery, as though somehow I was invisible or less than a person. It was really tough to have to walk by this group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan, a McGill law student, contacted the Center for Research Action on Race Relations, which will demand sanctions against the students involved in the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not borne out of malice, it was probably just ignorance,&#8221; said Fo Niemi, executive director of the centre. &#8220;But ignorance is not a defence for this type of behaviour. The university needs to address this and adapt their code of conduct to prevent this sort of behaviour from happening again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Niemi and Morgan said they wished to raise awareness on campus of the harmful nature of racial stereotypes.</p>

		<p>Anyone not familiar with Montreal would be shocked by the level of &#8216;blackness&rsquo; today.</p>
<p>Before 1965, only a few blacks lived there, mainly porters working for the railway.</p>
<p>It was the Quebec nationalists who began inviting Africans and Haitians in, to increase the number of French language speakers, and to show solidarity with Marxist principles of &#8216;liberation&rsquo; ideology.</p>
<p>Now this beautiful city is full of ghetto slums, gangster street gangs, and blacks preying on any white girl they see. </p>

I used to work with college age males who would make racially explicit comments and observations. I would joking say to them, &#8216;you know, that&rsquo;s racist&rsquo;. They would reply, &#8216;it&rsquo;s not racist if it&rsquo;s true&rsquo;.</p>
<p>How ignorant they are. I only wish I could be there when one of their non-racist, true observation gets them into trouble with a less forgiving co-workers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing with all the ant-racist propaganda young kids face today, they still haven&rsquo;t gotten the message that any observation based on race is racist. They only seem to learn the lesson when they become the accused.</p>
<p>The one good thing to come out of these incidents is that they send blacks into a tailspin. They end up focusing only on finding racism and they can&rsquo;t get on with their lives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whites will move on.</p>

		<p>Blacks engage in a sea of crime against whites, currently the racially motivated &#8220;flash mobs&#8221;, but they cry &#8220;racism&#8221; like babies when they feel slighted. This is the typical wimp-bully mentality so many of them have.</p>

<p>Before 1965 only a very few blacks lived ANYWHERE in Canada. My mother and father (born 1931 and 1928 respectively), were both well into their twenties, before either one of them ever even laid eyes on a black.</p>

<p>I remember one called &#8216;watermellon man&rsquo; that featured a black actor made up as white. He played two races. In the beginning he was white. In the rest of the movie he was black. I thought he was white, at the beginning. It was so well done, you couldn&rsquo;t tell whether he was a black actor made up as white or a white actor made as black. How deplorable! Why, it could have been a white actor made up as black. Hollywood is so sneaky with their evil racism against people of color.</p>

		<p>So a few white kids in black face at a college campus have blacks up in arms screaming racism but it&rsquo;s OK for most of the advertisements on TV to feature whites, especially males, as buffoons? And add to that the TV shows that refuse to show blacks as criminals, substituting whites instead? Including those sorry excuses for movies coming out of Hollywood. And the media who refuse to report the race of criminals if they&rsquo;re black? And last but not least, law enforcement officials and government who pander endlessly to these cry babies? Oh, please. I am so sick of this double standard.</p>

		<p>So, do blacks believe there&rsquo;s something wrong with being black?  If a group of students donned tartan plaid, played bagpipes, swigged Scotch whiskey, and spoke with Scottish accents, I  &mdash;  as one of Celtic heritage  &mdash;  would not be at all insulted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was humiliating as though your race is somehow a costume for buffoonery&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Your RACE is somehow a COSTUME? A costume for BUFFOONERY? What kind of language are you talking there, Mr. Morgan? </p>
<p>Yeah, I get what the guy&rsquo;s trying to say   &mdash;   but seriously, how could race be a costume for buffoonery? It&rsquo;s a ridiculous mixing of metaphors. Typical pseudo-intellectual gibberish from a dark-skinned nitwit who imagines himself a brilliant orator   &mdash;   of a piece with the ungrammatical nonsense we constantly hear from Sharpton, Jackson, and other professional afro-agitators. <br>
 <br>
I think I like Jamaicans better when they just say &#8220;Ya mon&#8221; over and over and over. </p>

<p>I think &#8216;Fo&rsquo; needn&rsquo;t worry, &#8220;awareness&#8221; is indeed being raised and not in the manner the blacks are expecting. One of the Rev. David Mannings&rsquo; sermons on youtube (he really is worth listening to) explains how the White man is one day gonna get tired of being ROBBED, BEATEN, MURDERED and his women being RAPED and when that happens, the Rev continues, IT IS GONNA BE UGLY and he emphasized the word UGLY!! Check out his sermons.</p>

		<p>Whites have been punished enough. We have paid a heavy price for the preceived slights these people allegedly endured, both in money, destroyed cities, and Citizens constantly under physical attack, without any Justice visited on the perpetrators. </p>
<p>And I am more than tired of hearing about Slavery, especially when it is directed at Whites who arrived in the US well after the Civil War was fought.</p>
<p>Add to that that Black-owned Slaves, as well, hypocrisy at its highest,along with the thousands of White Union Soldiers that died during that War for their freedom, and you have one ungrateful bunch of parasites on your hands. </p>
<p>But why should Canada experience this black rage? They were the destination for those runaway blacks in the underground Railroad. </p>
<p>So even Canada, a land that encouraged the blacks to travel there for their freedom, must suffer because most Canadians are White. </p>
<p>There is only one logical solution to this problem, and it is mass deportation of these people back to Africa. </p>
<p>Then make sure no White country has anything more to do with that Continent, as they destroy themselves. <br>

<p>Although I have written angry, incisive posts on his site, I watch Colbert once a week, contrasting him to his object of comedy, Bill O&#8221;Reilly&rsquo;s &#8220;No Spin Zone&#8221; which does nothing but spin and employ hyperbole most of the time.  It is a good practice to listen to who you think your enemies are, because not everyone is right all the time, and not everyone is wrong all the time.</p>
