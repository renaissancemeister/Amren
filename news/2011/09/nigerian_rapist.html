			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anil Dawar, Express, September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A rapist has avoided deportation from the UK after European judges yesterday ruled kicking him out would violate his right to a family life.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Nigerian has no partner or children but the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg ordered the British Government to let him stay and pay Â£3,500 of his legal bill.</p>
<p>The rapist, identified only as AA after the court gave in to his demands for anonymity, was 15 when he was given four years in 2002 for raping a 13-year-old girl. He had only been in the country two years at the time.</p>
<p>Since his conviction, the rapist from Bexleyheath, south-east London, has completed A-levels, a degree and a masters course at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense and now works for a local authority.</p>
<p>UK Independence Party MEP Gerard Batten said: &#8220;Yet again we see that because of the human rights industry we can no longer deal with foreign criminals on our own soil.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Border Agency spokeswoman said: &#8220;We are extremely disappointed by this judgment and will consider the next steps carefully.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not about justice.</p>
<p>This is about Strasbourg flexing its muscles.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in charge? They are. What better way to express it than shoving unpopular decisions down the English throats.</p>

		<p>Right to family life for a loner rapist? So he can&rsquo;t be deported because would be too heartbroken without his beloved white rape victims?</p>

		<p>Once a country gives up even a bit of its sovereignity to a supra-national organization, its basically over. This is just a power play. It is about Strasbourg telling London who&rsquo;s boss.</p>

		<p>If they deported all the rapists out of England it would be a pretty empty place. They have been raping and plundering Ireland illegally for over a century. If karma is real, the English are getting theirs right now.</p>

		<p>The solution, of course, is for Britain to pull out of the EU.  Thumb their nose at them.  Deport him anyway.  I see that happening with not just Britain over the next decade.<br>
The EU will collapse.  The UN would collapse if the US wasn&rsquo;t paying 75% of it&rsquo;s upkeep.<br>
That should be the next thing to go.  </p>

<p>Losing normal rights is what is supposed to happen when you commit crimes.  I hope British judges reject the decision and wrest their right to national determination away from the European Court.</p>

		<p>It would appear this life form has the support of people with an agenda. How else could &ldquo;AA&rdquo; fund his defence all the way to the top court in Luxemburg. When feral criminals such as this get the support of the powerful you see clearly the pattern of those that want a new society with different values far removed from those of our ancestors. </p>

		<p>Some &#8220;liberal&#8221; opinion-formers in the UK think anyone who can get into Britain has the &#8220;human right&#8221; to remain, ergo anyone and everyone on the planet has the &#8220;human right&#8221; to enter and remain.</p>

		<p>We submit to the state in exchange for the state&rsquo;s promise to carry out justice on our behalf. When the state fails to deliver justice, we no longer feel obliged to submit to its dictates. That&rsquo;s the real danger of cases like this  &mdash;  anarchy is encouraged by the appearance of an ineffectual state.</p>

		<p>Britain is long gone. Much like all of Europe and America. What happened to the White man&rsquo;s courage and resolve to protect their OWN with fire in their eyes? Even the papa (and mama) lion will kill to save their young.<br>
We could learn something from the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>Give me the days when White men were men and White women were women. In the true sense, that is. No wonder we cannot get respect anymore. No one likes a coward. FEAR is a great motivator and we need to regain and dispense that fear again.</p>

Try to act like a man and you will be put in your place pretty quickly&hellip;.  esp. if you&rsquo;re a teenager or in your 20&rsquo;s.<br>
we&rsquo;ve been feminized and I know because I&rsquo;m not&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  it&rsquo;s like all the movies and shows you see where the chick is beating the hell out of everyone&hellip;.  in real life that is bunk&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. </p>

<p>Most, repeat most of the black goverment employees I had to work with had criminal convictions of one sort or another.  Almost all black women I worked with had a criminal husband, boyfriend, brother or son.</p>
<p>Typical goverment employee.  I wonder what his job is?  Probably some racial department.</p>
