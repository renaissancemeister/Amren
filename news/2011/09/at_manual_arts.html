			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sandy Banks, Los Angeles Times, September 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Art teacher Jeremy Davidson skipped the annual back-to-school-night at Manual Arts High this week.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d walked off the job the day before  &mdash;  after 10 years at the mid-city campus  &mdash;  done in by a group of unruly ninth-graders who&rsquo;d hijacked his sixth-period drawing class.<br>
While Davidson was &#8220;trying to give a lesson on shading,&#8221; the troublemakers were &#8220;whacking each other with rulers, throwing paper across the room, getting up and walking around.&#8221;</p>
<p>They blocked the door when he tried to close it, talked over him when he tried to teach.</p>
<p>The first time it happened this semester, he summoned security &#8220;four times during the period and help never came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Day after frustrating day, he said, the scenario replayed. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So two weeks after the school year began Sept. 7  &mdash;  after a string of sleepless nights  &mdash;  Davidson called his principal from class midmorning and said: &#8220;It would be best if you got me covered so I can pack my things and go.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} Two days earlier, he had emailed The Times, complaining about &#8220;the awful conditions&#8221; at Manual Arts.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, I had to wonder, what kind of teacher abandons those students when the semester has barely begun? A teacher at the end of his rope, Davidson told me; one who has had his fill of broken promises and dashed hopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You keep raising your expectations, but nothing changes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After all these years, I look around and see that things are just getting worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>After spending years on a year-round schedule, Manual Arts switched this month to a traditional school calendar, which puts 3,200 students on a campus built for 1,000, during a year when the Los Angeles Unified School District is drastically cutting teachers and funding.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>That extra time is important to a school with some of the district&rsquo;s lowest test scores, where two-thirds of the students drop out. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The school has had 10 principals in 10 years. Its faculty long has been considered a combustible mix of firebrand activists and holding-out-for-retirement deadwood.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} In the meantime, Davidson&rsquo;s decided not to resign, but instead ask for a leave of absence. &#8220;I still love teaching,&#8221; he insists. &#8220;And I&rsquo;ve got some very talented kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Editor&rsquo;s Note: According to <a href="https://search.lausd.k12.ca.us/cgi-bin/fccgi.exe?w3exec=school.profile.content&amp;which=8743">this site</a>, Manual Arts School is 82.1% Hispanic, 17.7% black, and 0% white.]</p>

<p>That is the badge of Diversity.  Let&rsquo;s just hope the worse they get, they get worse even faster for White liberal elites who force hostile and dangerous anti white diversity upon the rest of us.  Our mission should be Operation Whitey.   Force them to feel the pain that they force upon us.   Our greatest task is to bring justice to Whitey enablers of Diversity.   It should cost them their jobs immediately.  We have more of a right to demand they &#8220;step down&#8221; than the diversity does.    Justice.<br>

		<p>I am a middle school math teacher teaching in a school that&rsquo;s 70 percent Asian and 30 percent white. My biggest discipline problem is students whispering to each other when I am teaching. These Asian kids are hard working, studious, and eager to learn. </p>
<p>Booyah to all these liberal professors of education who taught me that Hispanic kids underachieve due to &#8216;white biased curriculum&rsquo; and language barriers. Many of my Asian students don&rsquo;t speak a single word of English when they come to America but they excel my math class and only an average of 1-2 years to catch up English. Hispanic kids born and raised in the U.S. are failing school because they &#8216;speak another language at home&rsquo;.<br>
These professors also blame their behavior problems on the &#8216;language barrier&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Poor Jose throws chairs at the teacher because he&rsquo;s frustrated that he doesn&rsquo;t understand English.</p>
<p>I propose bringing on more Asian immigration so that us teachers can actually teach. Even the white kids are less motivated. I mean, they don&rsquo;t engage in violent behavior like Latinos and Blacks, but they tend to be much chattier than Asians and less motivated to learn than Asians.</p>
<p>Every teacher&rsquo;s dream class is filled with Korean, Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, and Japanese immigrants.<br>

		<p>This is just one reason why our education system needs a massive reworking. There is no earthly reason that kids who do not behave and disrupt class should be permitted to stay in school. The district that I attended in the late 80&rsquo;s actually kept the kids that were either disruptive or very low achieving in seperate classrooms and they were around other kids only at lunch and break times. After a kid turned 12 or 15 they were &#8220;placed&#8221; in either middle or high school so that they were not larger or mature than the other students. The school mostly turned a blind eye these kids who usually dropped out during or after 9th grade. </p>
<p>Personally I think that high school should be optional to begin with. It is practically a holding pen for adolescents until they reach the age of 18 and are turned loose. If the behavior problems were simply ejected after 8th grade and the low achievers were placed in vocational education appropriate to their intellegence level much of the problems would be solved. The other day I noticed Mike Rowe of dirty jobs talking about a foundation that encouraged kids (and adults) to go to trade schools or community colleges. Not everyone is college material and forcing everyone into college prep classes (even dumbing down the material and calling it &#8220;college prep&#8221;) is often like putting square pegs into round holes. The kids who were not college material often drop out after a couple of years or end up with useless degrees and huge student loan debt. If they were encouraged to attend a trade or vocational school they could be self sufficient by age 20-21.</p>

		<p>Again I would like to quote the famous saying of Gallileo&rsquo;s, <br>
&#8220;No one can teach anyone anything, the learner has to find it in himself.&#8221; This fact, I believe it is a fact, was also stated by St. Augustine, who said the learner ultimately become self illuminated, and the teacher does play a role but a minor one.</p>

		<p>I taught school for one semester where my class was 99% blacks, luckily I found a better job at a much better (less diverse) school, but my experience with these 5th grade black children was almost too much to bear.<br>
Shear animals, no manners, violent behavior, filthy language and these were 5th. graders.<br>
I wonder if white Americans will ever tell these creatures that enough is enough or will we just be destroyed by them as Thomas Jefferson predicted?</p>

		<p>The difference in the schools of today and those of yesteryear is like night and day. Every classroom needs a Sister Mary Gabriel! This behavior should not be tolerated. My only suggestion, as a former teacher, would be to get them out of the classroom and into a cage somewere. They sound totally unteachable.  </p>

		<p>What I can&rsquo;t for the life of me figure out is why, for the love of God, in the past 5 years, would anyone desire to become a teacher? Unless a position in a virtually all white private school is guaranteed, why would anyone actually CHOOSE this environment as a career in this day and age?</p>
<p>More than ever, my philosophy is: I don&rsquo;t do babysitting. I won&rsquo;t look after your kids. But if you need someone to take care of your dogs, I&rsquo;m your gal. But schools are simply war zones.</p>

		<p>I have been teaching for 20 years across three states.  Just my luck, in all that time I have had only one (1!) white student in all of my classes.  All the rest, over 20 years, have been non-white.</p>
<p>Besides my experience of going to school in an all-white context, I do not know what it means to teach white students.</p>

		<p>0 % whitey! And there is 0 % for GOOD REASON!</p>
<p>And this teacher, as good as he probably is, lasted ten years. Amazing that could be. Put up with the nonsense as long as he did says he is a person dedicated to his job.</p>
<p>There are college grads that have spent four years preparing themselves to be teachers, have the intention of a life-time career in teaching, go to their first job at a school like &#8220;Manual&#8221; and don&rsquo;t even last a DAY! Find that the conditions are so bad that teaching is impossible. And this is not a rare occurrence, it is quite common. Very sad!</p>

<p>Is &#8220;Jennifer&#8221; the best &#8220;White&#8221; name you could come up with?</p>
<p>You are a troll who has posted this exact comment on a number of different threads, all with the same exact same grammatical errors.</p>
<p>You are fooling no one here.</p>
<p>There is not a single reason to import Asians; they can stay in their own countries and not have to live among us &#8220;less motivated&#8221; Whites.  How was it we &#8220;less motivated&#8221; Whites managed to put a man on the moon without the help of Asians?</p>

<p>It is not the fault of Native Born White Americans that Asians create countries in which they do not want to live.  </p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/BAti" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/BAti</a></p>
<p>We Native Born White Americans do not have to cede our living space to Asian colonists; all non-White immigration must be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>And no, Asian children are not every teacher&rsquo;s dream.</p>

		<p>Racial issues no longer can be issued openly and honestly in this country due to anti-hate laws.  It is unbelievable that this country has voluntarily bound itself towards self destruction by making the whites the minority.  It has gone over the cliff pandering and catering to blacks and Hispanics.  These two racial groups are the future of this country but rather the destruction of it.</p>

<p>Who else but a racist meanie would &#8220;abandon&#8221; those  poor &#8220;at-risk&#8221; kids, who are so promisin, so talented, and so much in need?   His decision to &#8220;abandon&#8221; them was done entirely for his own selfish reasons. So what if he has a heart attack or nervous breakdown?  Those talented, wonderful kids need him.  He&rsquo;s like the captain abandoning the ship with all in it.  For shame! What a disgrace!<br>

<p>I see Korean women every day at the gym, all talking in Korean, violating all the rules of the pool area (like doing al sorts of private grooming, washing their hair in the hot tub, scaling off dead skin with pumice stones, rubbing ointments all over themselves in  bizarre, senseless rituals, jabbering loudly, arrogantly, walking around like aggressive trolls.</p>
<p>I have had the misfortune of working alongside Korean women, and they were awful people&hellip;vindictive, scheming, and actually stupid as rocks.  I mean DUMB, and aggressively so. And they have the emotional maturity of maladjusted two year olds.</p>
<p>I really must contest, based on voluminous life experience, the idea that  that Koreans are highly intelligent. I don&rsquo;t buy it at all, and I really think KOREA is just the place for them.<br>
They can enjoy their puppy- meat on a stick there.</p>

		<p>That school is typical of modern education`s panacea for &#8221; troubled&#8221; youth, gladiator academies. America refuses to accept that it has only 1 social problem, bastardy. There is a good possibility that not 1 kid in his class came from a two parent married family. There are gladiator schools in New York City where not one child in a school of 3000 is legitimate. We have written off 75% of the black race, 65% Mexican Hispanics, and 33% of the white race. Why on Earth would a black kid at his school consider learning a trade as anything but what it is, a E-ticket ride to nowhere. Who in their right mind would hire a kid from such a place when he could out source the work to a kid with a 130 IQ from the Punjab. We have at last reached the point of no return where the vote pandering of the democrats has created what all knew it would, a nation with 25% of it`s citizens borderline psycopathic nihilists. I see no change this side of a inter-necine blood bath where a coalition of Asians, middle class whites, the few reamining un-corrupted blacks and conservative Puerto-Ricans fight back with a dictatorship.<br>

		<p>The most tragic part of this predicament has not even been addressed. I am the pension fund manager for a large state teachers&rsquo; organization. I&rsquo;m not in California, but I&rsquo;m quite familiar with CALSTRS - the California State Teachers Retirement System. My prediction: thanks entirely to the massive waves of legal/illegal (there&rsquo;s hardly much difference anymore) immigration that the once-proud &#8220;Golden State&#8221; has been subjected to over the last several decades - and the concomittant expenditures on social welfare programs - and the massive &#8220;white flight&#8221; from the state - CALSTRS (the teachers&rsquo; retirement fund) will become so grossly under-funded that it will simply collapse. Forget the (laughble) claim that, by state law, this cannot happen. Forget the presumption that a stumbling federal economy (wherin only 1/2 of the citizenry pays taxes) will have the wherewithal to bail California out. All those teachers whose working lives were devoured bearing the unbearable for 25 - 30 - 35 - 40 years will be rewarded for their superhuman efforts by walking away with &#8220;nada&#8221; and spending their old age in poverty. Sound bleak? It&rsquo;s right around the corner - and not just in California, either. I&rsquo;m no Cassandra, just a numbers cruncher - but even an old codger with cataracts like myself can see the handwriting on THIS wall. Trust me, things are about to get very, very interesting.</p>

		<p>I am NO fan of Sandy Banks, a black female who at times can be anti-White, but I must commend her for printing this story truthfully. I encourage everyone to read the entire article in toto to get an idea of WHAT YOUR tax dollar are supporting   &mdash;   out of control non-White schools where the teenage inmates are in complete control and daily anarchy reigns. </p>
<p>It is exactly as stated in the article, and the more the public knows about what goes on these type of schools, the better.  It&rsquo;s about time, long past time.</p>
<p>Here is a VERY typical example of how administrators and other &#8220;support staff&#8221; deal with requests for help from teachers (from the article):</p>
<p><i>When he sought support, administrators met his request with a checklist: Have you contacted their parents? Have you encouraged the students? Have you treated them with respect?</i></p>
<p>Treat violent students who are trying to stab each other with paint brushes with respect?  Encourage students who are out of their seats trying to block the door as the teacher is trying to close it?  NOPE   &mdash;   better for the administrators to hide in the main office and blame teachers for the anarchy; they will write on your evaluation that you &#8220;can&rsquo;t control your classes&#8221;:  <i>&#8216;The overcrowded, dirty classrooms, and lack of support from administrators, is demoralizing and crushing the teachers  &mdash;  and not fair to students,&rsquo; he wrote.</i></p>
<p><i>The school has had 10 principals in 10 years.</i> </p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t imagine why.</p>
<p>Also from the article:</p>
<p><i>Seven students needed to be removed, so I could teach the other 45. &hellip; And I&rsquo;m expected to spend a week providing all this documentation, while these kids spend 50 minutes each day destroying the class for everyone else.</i></p>
<p>This poor teacher has 52 students in a sixth-period art class where students use scissors, rules, and paint brushes as weapons.  Don&rsquo;t EVER EVER tell me that class size doesn&rsquo;t matter, or I will go postal!! Anyone who DARES to tell one of us teachers that ONE teacher can handle 52 NAM 14 year olds 6th period either needs to come in and show us teacher how to first settle this many students down in their seats and then try to maintain control (let alone teach without books)   &mdash;   OR, needs to shut the hell up:   <i>It will be the start of week four before every kid has a textbook in their hands,&rsquo; said history teacher Daniel Beebe, who had &#8216;zero&rsquo; textbooks for 160 students in U.S. history and government classes.</i></p>
<p>I defy anyone to come into one of these classrooms by himself at the end of the day and try to restore order.</p>
<p>Also, elective classes ARE used as dumping grounds for the very worst students in the school:  kids coming from camp or other locked-up facilities (some with court orders from clueless judges who state that &#8220;the best place for them is in school!&#8221;), mainstreamed special Ed students, many of whom have psychotic or aberrant behavior problems, assorted thugs with nowhere else to  put them   &mdash;   they are one and all programmed into art, drama (to &#8220;express&#8221; their excess energy, I was told), cooking, and any shop or gardening classes that still exist AFTER LUNCH when their behavior is the very worst.  </p>
<p>That these classes run over 50 with ONE teacher expected to control ALL of them without any support as the above article states is obscene.</p>
<p>Again, kudos to Sandy Banks for faithfully reporting this story and to the LA Times for printing it.</p>
<p>My only question is this:  What took you so long? These things have been going on for over two decades in these schools.  I know because I was in one of these schools not too far from &#8220;Manuel&#8221; Arts for nine long years.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
<p>Istavan:  GREAT name, I plan to use your entirely appropriate euphemism from now on when referring to Manual Arts   &mdash;   giving you full credit, of course.</p>

		<p>Note to all White Teachers in these crap holes called &#8220;Public Schools&#8221;. Go to work, put your feet up on the desk, read your paper, and drink coffee for the 45 minute period. Do this every day. </p>
<p>Then give everyone in Class an &#8220;A&#8221;. Pass them all with extremely high grades of Academic achievement. </p>
<p>When they graduate your High School, you will then be free of the leaches, and you will be one more year to your 20 year retirement. On that day, when you hit your 20th year, have your papers all filled out, and turn them in to the Administration. </p>
<p>You are retired, and the end of the School day. Meanwhile, all the black and brown Scholars can&rsquo;t read a job application, or write their name, but who cares? They just need a certain color skin to get the job in the first place, right? </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how far they get when there is no one there to lead them around by the nose. Haiti, anyone? </p>

<p>While I have no doubt that you believe what you say, I do not belive that Asians should mass immigrate to America. They still have a different culture than White America.</p>
<p>It is White people who created the most prosperous, most free, most civilized nations on earth(I know, unfortunately,all this is changing in America). While Asians do very well in school, most of their countries are not considered First World nations. These nations are based on their beliefs, attitudes, and ideas, which are different than Western culture. It is we White people who know how to create First World nations based on our beliefs, attitudes, and ideas. And we created America without Asians guiding us along the way!<br>
 <br>
Besides, we White people should not be forced to step aside in the country we created.</p>

		<p>Mr. Tiffany, you make a very valid point that a great deal of the problems with today&rsquo;s society are due to bastardy, but (as I&rsquo;m sure you know) different ethnic groups have developed different &#8220;survival strategies&#8221;, with Europeans displaying high-investment parenting and long-termism, while Africans do not have the capacity to plan for the future, hence alarming bastardy rates.</p>
<p>Compounding this is comprehensive government funding of single mothers- a black man could assiduously work in a low-grade job to provide for his family, but when the mother gets more money if he weren&rsquo;t around (as would he), then he will be deemed surplus to requirements pretty quickly!</p>
<p>Immigration must end, and policies introduced to sharply curtail the benefits of those &#8220;welfare queens&#8221; who breed kids to ensure a flow of government money. This will go some way to reducing the black and general low-IQ birth rate, but there will still be a way to go down that road.</p>

<p>While I admit that Asians are model students, it&rsquo;s whites that are more productive in the real world. In addition, Asians are more likely to cheat on their taxes, bring their families here and hire them to work under the table, and engage in corrupt business practices. So they don&rsquo;t pay their fair share of taxes and WHITES end up picking up the tab.<br>

<p>Many goverment workers are in both pension and social security<br>
programs.  It means huge deductions from their paychecks when working but the pension plus social security is great when they retire.</p>
<p>The problem with California and many other states is that the teachers are not in social security.  Those teachers who went directly into teaching will not get social security when they retire because they were never in it.</p>
<p>So if the pension system goes, the teachers will really be in poverty.  </p>

<p>If schools were not some sort of social experiment and allowed to do what they were designed to do- teach- then reworking would not be necessisary. If kids were placed into classes based on performance on standardized tests and grades instead of worrying about self esteem or poorly behaved kids were encouraged to drop out then schools would be much better places. </p>

		<p>As the baby boomer teachers retire there will be a severe shortage. Almost all teacher openings are in hardcore black and Hispanic schools.  Young mostly women start in these schools and often quite the first month.  </p>
<p>I taught at a school where the 100 percent black 4th graders went through 7 teachers in 9 months.</p>
<p>This was not a welfare school.  The parents were all government workers.</p>
<p>So the blacks and Hispanics will get exactly what they deserve, substitutes and several teachers every year.  It will be sweet revenge on all the affirmative action black and hispanic administrators who are going to have to step in and teach the them when the substitutes refuse to come to their jungle.</p>
<p>There are many schools in black neighborhoods where substitutes just refuse to come after December.  By then the word has got around about the dangers and horror show.  Even $175.00 per day can&rsquo;t entice substitutes, let alone permanent teachers.</p>

		<p>Engleman mentioned well behaved asian kids in libraries.</p>
<p>I have noticed that hispanic kids who come to the libraries are very well behaved.  Black kids often come to the library after school to see their friends, talk as loudly as possible and disrupt the entire building.  Hispanics who don&rsquo;t want to read or look at the internet just don&rsquo;t go to the library.  If they want to be with friends they go to a park or somebody&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>Part of the reason rowdy screeching black kids go to libraries is the old black custom of &#8220;putting out&#8221;.  Many black Mothers don&rsquo;t let their children in the house after school.  They insist the kids stay out even in rain and snow and freezing weather.<br>
It is very common.  It is why so many rowdy black kids infest the<br>
cities after school.  Their Mothers don&rsquo;t want them or their thug friends in the house.</p>
<p>Every other race is free to go home after school.  It is only blacks who lock their children out no matter what the weather.<br>
Even the civil service &#8220;professionals&#8221; do this.</p>

		<p>   I teach mostly black students. They are disruptive, singing, rapping, dancing, moving desks around, getting up to talk to someone across the room, etc. This happens frequently. After requests, warnings, etc., one young man told me to &#8220;su&& my ****.&#8221; This is common. It happens to the white women teachers, the white men teachers, and, believe it or not, some of the more refined black teachers. </p>
<p>   Now, I know there are those of you who are thinking, &#8220;It&rsquo;s your own fault, liberal do-gooder.&#8221; I can&rsquo;t leave the profession because I am 58 years old. The economy stinks. I do part-time work from home, just to have some sort of satisfaction. Teaching black students has really damaged my mental and physical health, my morale, and my optimism that this situation will turn around.</p>
<p>   I would tell anyone who wants to become a teacher not to do it. Surely there are other, more worthwhile things to do with one&rsquo;s time than babysit thugs. <br>

<p>As legions of older, experienced and actually knowledgeable white teachers retire (or quit), they are being replaced by mostly young females who were raised on the social justice kool aid.</p>
<p>They oftentimes don&rsquo;t have much content at all (I know of what I speak.)  They spend their classtimes doing gimmicks to keep the kids entertained such as &#8220;Project based learning&#8221; (think: glitter, glue and posterboard), &#8220;Jigsaws&#8221; (think: roaming around looking for disjointed snippets of text at other tables), &#8220;Station activities (think: little worksheets, 1-2 paragraphs summaries or looking at pics in a merry-go round of tables) and tons of other things to &#8220;get them moving&#8221; but not actually learning much.  And this is all in high school!</p>
<p>Lots of minority teachers are coming in the pipeline now.  Some of them are very nice and sincere, yet in my estimation, most are woefully lacking in even proper English diction and grammar.  (I have seen this SO much!)</p>
<p>So increasingly Pablo and Shaniqua are being taught be people who are not up to the standards of traditional American education.  The content gets more watered down all the time.  (You should see some of the new textbooks designed for the &#8216;urban&rsquo; classroom!  American Guidance Society AGS has some real doosies!)</p>
<p>20 years from now, we WILL be like MExico, South Africa or Brazil.  It won&rsquo;t be pretty.</p>

<p>If Asian students are indeed nice to teach (even, God forbid, nicer than white students), what are supposed to do - deliberately keep quiet about it?</p>

		<p>it is not every white Americans dream to have the US taken over by another huge influx of immigrants, this time form Asia. I dont wish to live in Korea or China. I am tired of hearing how wonderful Asians are and how wonderful we are to have them. I went to school in Bellevue wa. the High school had about ten asians when I went there  - it was wonderful having only english speaking students, no crime, no fights. just Really nice white kids. now it is 47 percent asian, 25 percent were not born in the US and are most likely illegal. My mother&rsquo;s house is surrounded with Hong Kong Chinese. I don&rsquo;t want the west coast to be Asian -I am sorry and all it will take is another Obama, because there are millions and millions of them that wish to come here.<br>
 In addition. I found an Asian woman trespassing through our property - cutting right through the driveway . It was hugely rude and when I told her she was trespassing she said she didnt speak English. Wait till you are the only white person and the Asians wont hire you because they hire family members from the old country.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We have at last reached the point of no return where the vote pandering of the democrats has created what all knew it would, a nation with 25% of it`s citizens borderline psycopathic nihilists&#8221;</p>
<p>You need to understand that the Repulicans have been there every step of the way. Blaming just the Democrats for this country&rsquo;s racial suicide is destroying White America faster than any Democrat&rsquo;s wildest dream. The Repulicans and. Democrats represent the system that has allowed this to happen. Whites in America by being duped by the likes of racial traitors such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity etc..you are following the Repulicans right of a cliff.</p>

<p><i>Why does every thread about schools/education devolve into an Asian-bashing hatefest? #26, what does a comment like that have anything to do with the original topic?</i></p>
<p>Why is it every thread about schools/education devolves into Asians telling us Whites how stupid and inferior we and our White children are?  I come here to discuss issues relevant to Whites and find myself confronted with Asians or their supporters demanding that the solution to White stupidity is to import massive numbers of Asian colonizers to race replace us.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want my country colonized by Asians.  I do not want to be race-replaced by Asians.  Anyone who thinks this is OK is pro-White genocide.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why.  </p>
<p>Pretty nervy, don&rsquo;t you think, to go on a site dedicated to White issues and bash Whites?  Do Whites do this on Asians threads?  Do they go on Asian-oriented forums, bash them and tell them to stop barging their way into White countries?  If so, post an example.</p>
<p> If I don&rsquo;t stand up and counter these Asian supremacists  and say something about White race replacement, who will?</p>

<p>I do have a quibble with Mr. Asian John Engelman. He is a troll and only writes about how great Asians are for this country and how smart and studious they are. Believe me I have worked and lived around these Vietnamese &#8220;refugees&#8221; and they are NOT what Engelman says they are.</p>
<p> I also had an older relative that married a Vietnamese and brought her here. He is now dead after a heart attack. She was using him to bring in her own FAMILY,(10 of them) which proceeded to live on welfare and SSA, while living in my relatives 3 bedroom trailer he had at that time. She also siphoned off all his money and cheated on him and gambled away (they lived in Vegas) his money(because she said, &#8220;what&rsquo;s the big deal&#8221; he could just go make more money)  Typical Asian.</p>
<p>So, John don&rsquo;t try to tell ME anything about these Vietnamese or any other Asian.</p>

As the baby boomer teachers retire there will be a severe shortage. Almost all teacher openings are in hardcore black and Hispanic schools. Young mostly women start in these schools and often quite the first month.</p>
<p>I taught at a school where the 100 percent black 4th graders went through 7 teachers in 9 months.</p>
<p>This was not a welfare school. The parents were all government workers.</p>
<p>So the blacks and Hispanics will get exactly what they deserve, substitutes and several teachers every year. It will be sweet revenge on all the affirmative action black and hispanic administrators who are going to have to step in and teach the them when the substitutes refuse to come to their jungle.</p>
<p>There are many schools in black neighborhoods where substitutes just refuse to come after December. By then the word has got around about the dangers and horror show. Even $175.00 per day can&rsquo;t entice substitutes, let alone permanent teachers.</p>

THis is SO TRUE, and it will be very funny to see how the media, the government and polite liberal society at large handle this catastrophe, when it comes (which is SOON).<br>
Imagine all those lazy black and mestizo administrators, who failed up, and threatened their way into promotions their whole careers; IMAGINE how it&rsquo;s going to be when they have to try and instill order, or God forbid, teach. <br>
They will, first, call in sick. Then they will take extended leaves, then, they will be forced to come back, and they will mentally SNAP. They will be throwing chairs around the rooms, slapping and wrestling students. They will go totally berserk! (Anyone here see that video of a black lady teacher doing a wrestle-down/ beat-down of another black student? (We&rsquo;re talking elementary school in that one!)</p>
<p>Yes, it is going to be fun to watch. The now browned and worthless school system is on the verge of imploding, and, man, is it going to be a mess! Home schooling and private all white schools will be the norm.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re welcome and I appreciate the kind words, same to #34, Shadrack Bond.</p>
<p>I do not hate Asians as some here have so accused me.  I work with an Asian from Taiwan whom I&rsquo;ve helped when he&rsquo;s had problems with beastly school administrators.  Believe me, I help VERY VERY few people these day, especially non-Whites.</p>
<p>For this, he has been eternally grateful, taken me out for Chinese food many times, brought me gifts of homemade steamed egg rolls, &#8220;special&#8221; green tea, silk scarves and paintings from Taiwan.</p>
<p>A few years ago he wanted to lead the few of us that he likes on a tour of mainland China   &mdash;   he brought in videos for us to look at of the landscapes, told us what we&rsquo;d see, explained the customs and history.  He was incredibly,  jumping up and down excited.  Over Christmas break, he traveled to China to check on accommodations, restaurants and arrange tours.  (he himself had never set foot on mainland China).</p>
<p>When he came back he was very short about the trip, only said we couldn&rsquo;t go there.  He offered up no explanation as to why, what he encountered, what he saw that made him sure we couldn&rsquo;t travel there.  I tried to get more info but he clammed up and I haven&rsquo;t heard a word since in over a year.  I suspect those photos I posted (from MarkB, BTW) had something to do with why &#8220;we couldn&rsquo;t go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, he agitating for us to take a trip to Taiwan, says it&rsquo;s very first world, very clean, lots of English&hellip;well, see.</p>

 I really appreciate your posts about not wanted to be race replaced by Asians and for calling trolls out on their worship of Asians as the Ideal Immigrant, lover, employee, employer, student.<br>
   Vietnamese and other asian immigrants are known for gangs, drugs marijuana grows prostitution etc in the Pacific Northwest.<br>
 I am not speaking of the Japanese who arrived almost a hundred years ago and were decent farmers etc.<br>
   I am glad to hear that trolls are the ones posting about how wonderful Asians and Indians are.<br>
 My friend, a native of the Bay Area in Ca and very liberal,left SF for TN, to get away from the Hong Kong Chinese that took over SF along with the gay males. <br>
 I suggest that those who think Asians are saints spend some time reading about the current and past customs of those cultures along with a book written in the 1920&rsquo;s,called the Gangs of New York. </p>

Bon, &#8220;And thank you for the link to the Youtube video on pollution in China. I knew the situation there was bad&#8221;</p>
<p>I work in a hospital staffed mostly by Asians, Indians and Fillipinos.  I got my job because I checked black instead of White.</p>
<p>About 6 weeks ago, in the midst of a 105 heat wave a Chinese Dr. I am friendly with  wanted us to sit outside during lunch.<br>
I told him it was 105 and extremely humid, are you nuts?  He replied that he just got back from vacation back home in China, a suburb of Bejing.</p>
<p>In 3 weeks he had never seen the sun.  The air pollution near <br>
Bejing is so bad the sky is gray from sunrise to sundown and the sun cannot be seen. All he wanted to do was sit in the sunshine and look at the blue sky despite 105 heat and humidity.</p>

<p>Washington County judge sentenced a 21-year-old Portland man to 20 years in prison Thursday in what he called the most brutal stranger-rape case he had ever seen. </p>
<p>Before 4 a.m. on Sept. 19 last year, while most of Beaverton slept, several residents woke to a high-pitched screaming that prompted them to call 9-1-1. </p>
<p>Reports described the sound as &#8220;surreal,&#8221; maybe the moaning of a wounded mountain lion. All believed the voice was coming from someone or something in distress. </p>
<p>The voice belonged to a 26-year-old woman, who police found in a church parking lot. She was naked from the waist down and bleeding, with one eye swollen shut and a missing tooth. </p>
<p>She told police she&rsquo;d been raped and didn&rsquo;t know her attacker. <br>
The woman testified at trial last month that she talked to the man, who police identified as Set Wai Aung, because he told her he was from Myanmar (formerly Burma), </p>

<p>Often, a lot sooner than 18.  And usually the reason is that the mother&rsquo;s new live-in boyfriend leans on her to throw her teenage sons out of the house, in order to clear away anything that seems to be competition for male household leadership.</p>
<p>One heavily black suburban St. Louis district operates and runs a boarding house for jettisoned teenage boys of such sort (Maplewood is the district, Joe&rsquo;s Place is the house, for those of you locals so interested).  When they opened it, they got a lot of inquiries from what were termed to be &#8220;urban districts&#8221; in St. Louis and nationally, because they wanted to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Watch the nature documentaries about lions some time.  Whenever a new male takes over the leadership of a pride of females, he ejects adolescent males and kills the young cubs sired by the previous pride leader.  That behavior has presented itself in human beings.  Whenever you hear news of an infant child murdered, it is almost always at the hands of the mother&rsquo;s new boyfriend who is not the baby&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>Those teachers who understood early on that CALSTRS is an underfuded FRAUD and diversified their retirement portfolios will be OK.</p>
<p>I could look around any given teachers&rsquo; parking lot and tell you which teachers will live in poverty and which will have money coming in after retirement.  One glance would be enough.</p>

That implies that I believe that every Oriental is superior to every person of every other race. It is also a straw man argument, because I do not believe that, and I have never said that I believe it. <br>
 <br>
When I point out that Orientals have a lower crime rate than whites I am agreeing with Jared Taylor. <br>

<p>But no matter how assiduous their students are (and it&rsquo;s admirable), or how industrious or law-abiding they are, I DO NOT WANT TO BE RACE-REPLACED BY THEM!</p>
<p>Mr. Engleman, why do you keep failing to get this point?<br>
 <br>

I get your point. I lack your concern. No one is going to replace either of us. <br>
 <br>
A number of posters here express fear for the future for the white race. I know from personal experience that it can be dangerous for a white person to live in proximity with blacks. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless, I suspect that much of this fear is really generated by changes in the U.S. economy. The oligarchy that is getting richer by cutting pay rolls and pay checks is almost exclusively white. </p>

<p>&ldquo;Asian supremacists�?</p>
<p>You see, here&rsquo;s the problem. When someone says whites are better in the classroom than blacks, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;race realism�?. But when someone says Asians are better in the classroom than whites, all of a sudden it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Asian supremacism�?. This makes any reasonable discussion impossible. Either it&rsquo;s realism all the time or it&rsquo;s supremacism all the time.</p>
<p>John Engelman never attacked anyone in his posts, yet everyone is attacking him just for stating what most of us know to be true. <br>

Those who have read only a small percentage of the comments I have posted here know that I express reasonably well informed comments on a large number of subjects. I favor more efforts to restrict third world immigration and to control crime (which happens to be disproportionally black).  <br>

		<p>When I point out that Orientals also tend to be more intelligent and sexually responsible than whites I am agreeing with Professor J. Philippe Rushton, who has spoken at American Renaissance conferences. - Engleman<br>

<p>If asians are better than Whites, why are they comming to OUR countries.  If your building is better than someone elses, then in general the materials and builder are better.  Every Asian that comes here is a vote for White Superiority.  And yet Asians come here and say they are superior to us.  I know some asians, they are smart, non-violent, nice, blah, blah, but all seem to have something missing compared to Whites.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re talking about students (which is what this topic was originally supposed to be about), then the answer is well-known within education circles. Most Asian foreign students are those who can&rsquo;t compete in their own countries. The top Asian students stay in Asia and get into Asian universities, but the second-rate Asian students (who know they cannot get a place at Asian universities but who still want a degree) come over to study in America where they can get a place more easily because the competition is less stiff. I&rsquo;ll let you explain how this constitutes a &#8220;vote for White Superiority&#8221;.</p>

The United States has most of the best universities in the world. I doubt they are easier to get into than top schools in Asian countries. <br>
 <br>

<p>As far as Oriental immigration to the United States is concerned, the last major influx of immigrants were Vietnamese war refugees after the War in Vietnam. <br>
 <br>
The fact that the United States has a more affluent society than countries like China and Japan is an accident of history that is ending. Consequently Chinese and Japanese immigration to the United States is much less than it was during the turn of the last century.  </p>

                 I have to agree that Asians are harder working and easier to teach. Also, they are more civil in public than whites in general. The white culture is so trashy now, sometimes I wonder why we are fighting for western civ, then I look at the barbarians.</p>

		<p>Luke #80: The White youth today are exposed to Hollywood and Madison Avenue propaganda garbage, every day from the time they are born, and unless you take an active part in controlling what you kids watch, or listen to, as far as music is concerned, they will become the trash trolls that you mentioned in your post.</p>
<p>My kids love Classic Movies, which are all they are allowed to watch, anyway, and as far as music is concerened, with rare exceptions, most of what they hear was not released after 1978.</p>
<p>Children are the product of what they are exposed to. They need constant reinforcement of what is good and what is not, from their parents, and other family members. </p>
<p>You will be surprised just how they pick up on things, and when objectional music is used in Television commercials, they are the ones changing the station, without us having to say a thing. </p>
