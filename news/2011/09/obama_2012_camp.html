			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Wallsten, Washington Post, September 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Obama&rsquo;s campaign is developing an aggressive new program to expand support from ethnic minority groups and other traditional Democratic voters as his team studies an increasingly narrow path to victory in next year&rsquo;s reelection effort.</p>
<p>The program, called &#8220;Operation Vote,&#8221; underscores how the tide has turned for Obama, whose 2008 brand was built on calls to unite &#8220;red and blue America.&#8221; Then, he presented himself as a politician who could transcend traditional partisan divisions, and many white centrists were drawn to the coalition that helped elect the country&rsquo;s first black president.</p>
<p>Today, the political realities of a sputtering economy, a more polarized Washington and fast-sinking presidential job approval ratings, particularly among white independents, are forcing the Obama campaign to adjust its tactics.</p>
<p>Operation Vote will function as a large, centralized department in the Chicago campaign office for reaching ethnic, religious and other voter groups. It will coordinate recruitment of an ethnic volunteer base and push out targeted messages online and through the media to groups such as blacks, Hispanics, Jews, women, seniors, young people, gays and Asian Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign officials say they have not given up on wooing independents, and the 2012 presidential election will certainly involve a fierce fight for the college-educated whites and suburbanites who were more likely to back Obama in 2008 than the working-class whites who have always been more skeptical.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Exit polls showed that Obama won 43 percent of the white vote in 2008  &mdash;  in the typical range for a Democrat  &mdash;  but Gallup shows that his approval rating among whites now stands at less than a third.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, the formula for Obama comes down to this: convincing enough additional minorities and core liberals to turn out and vote next year to make up for a loss of support from centrist and conservative whites.</p>

		<p><i>President Obama&rsquo;s campaign is developing an aggressive new program to expand support from ethnic minority groups&hellip;</i></p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, I think &#8220;ethnic minority groups&#8221; means Jewish voters, whom Obama mistakenly thinks he lost because of NY-9.  I wrote in my little soapbox after the NY-9 results and the fallout in earnest that if Team Obama wants to misinterpret NY-9 to mean that he is losing the Jewish vote, that was fine with me.  </p>
<p>The reality, as Forbes Magazine states, is that NY-9 is the least wealthy heavily white (or white-ish) Congressional district in New York City, confirming my suspicion that the bad economy, not the I-J-Z issue base, cost the Democrats there.  But Obama and his cronies will ignore the economy and keep on pushing those irrelevant I-J-Z issues to the voters he will already have.  </p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve stated here before, these &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; that are going on are practice runs for Nov. 2012. Neither Obama or Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder have spoke out about them and, IMO, are behind them. These will be Obamas &#8220;foot soldiers&#8221; if or when he loses re-election. Obama will NOT go quietly!  </p>

		<p>black culture in the US is more degenerate than i have ever seen and this degeneracy is not just among ghetto blacks even college educated blacks behave in a disgusting and uncivilized manner as i have observed in public. i dont know where it ends. it has also caused degeneracy among white kids who think it is cool to emulate ghetto blacks or blacks in general. the white left progressives promote this sickness. disgusting is all i can say sad and sick stupid people.</p>

		<p>Americans better pay close attention to this.  It is extremely obvious that Obama cannot win a re-election by any standard you apply.  But that is not what his behavior is signalling.  He&rsquo;s put in place what amounts to a shadow government and focused all his attention on the nutjobs in our society&hellip;.exactly the type of people an evil dictator would attempt to tap as jackboots.</p>
<p>More than once during the last few years, he&rsquo;s experimented with various &#8220;martial law&#8221; type scenarios. Phony plagues.  Disasters that were not.  FEMA has been drastically tampered with.</p>
<p>This jackass must be made to understand that this country won&rsquo;t allow a castro style take over&hellip;especially not by him.</p>
