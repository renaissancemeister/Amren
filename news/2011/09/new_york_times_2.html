<h1>&#8216;New York Times&rsquo; on a Racial Profiling Goose Chase</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mona Charen, The Tennessean, September 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Aug. 31, 2011, story by Al Baker covers a federal judge&rsquo;s ruling that a case challenging the New York Police Department&rsquo;s &#8220;stop and frisk&#8221; policy can go forward. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} The suit alleges that the NYPD&rsquo;s policy is based &#8220;not on reasonable suspicion of individuals but on racial profiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge declined to dismiss the case, saying, &#8220;This case presents an issue of great public concern. Writ large, that issue is the disproportionate number of African-Americans and Latinos who become entangled in our criminal justice system, as compared to Caucasians.&#8221; Note the passive voice. Like flies in a spider&rsquo;s web, they become &#8220;entangled&#8221; in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>{snip} The story editorializes: &#8220;As a practical matter, the stops display a measurable racial disparity: Black and Hispanic people generally represent more than 85 percent of those stopped by the police, though their combined populations make up a small share of the city&rsquo;s racial composition.&#8221;</p>
<p>OK. Are there any other relevant statistics here? The story does cite Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly&rsquo;s position that &#8220;The racial breakdown of the stops correlates to the racial breakdown of crime suspects.&#8221; But no sooner does the story allude to the elephant in the room than it takes issue with the NYPD, warning that the rising number of stops is &#8220;bringing the practice under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers (no one is quoted), academics (ditto), the Center for Constitutional Rights and the New York Civil Liberties Union.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the exception of the glancing reference to Kelly&rsquo;s explanation, <em>The New York Times</em> never provides the most relevant statistics regarding minorities and violent crime, which concern not the percentage of blacks or Hispanics in the population, but the percentage of those who commit violent crimes. <em>City Journal&rsquo;s</em> Heather MacDonald supplied them:</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks committed 66 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009 (though they were only 55 percent of all stops and only 23 percent of the city&rsquo;s population). Blacks committed 80 percent of all shootings in the first half of 2009. Together, blacks and Hispanics committed 98 percent of all shootings. Blacks committed nearly 70 percent of all robberies. Whites, by contrast, committed 5 percent of all violent crimes in the first half of 2009, though they are 35 percent of the city&rsquo;s population (and were 10 percent of all stops). They committed 1.8 percent of all shootings and less than 5 percent of all robberies.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <em>The New York Times</em> and the CCR, police should respond to crimes only in proportion to population statistics. {snip}</p>

<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;  - I have a better idea!  Cops should not police black or latino communities at all!  After all, they are racists, and are out to frame the innocent ones in the ghettos and barrios.  Just don&rsquo;t arrest anybody from those places!</p>
<p>They should concentrate only on policing white people, and do it real tough.  It has to be that way, because on ALL those cop shows like CSI and Without a Trace, the villains are almost 99% of the time white people.  If I was a cop in an urban area, I would not arrest or stop and frisk any minority ever.  We have to redress past racial discrimination in arrests, don&rsquo;tcha know!</p>

		<p>We must be undergoing a sea change in attitudes about race.  The Tennessean is liberal Nashville&rsquo;s main rag, and helped to defeat the English Only movement a few years ago.</p>
<p>Even White liberals are getting fed up with African durability of resistance to morality?</p>
<p>Tennessee had been on a horrible descent ever since the Agrarians were split up and some moved North and became &#8220;moderates&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now that the original I&rsquo;ll Take My Stand prophecies are proven every day over and over again, White liberals are living in fear that their old age will be dismal, gloomy and very scary when blacks, Mexicans, and Muslims are ruling the nation.</p>
<p>These Whiteys will say that we should embrace the future, but they aren&rsquo;t suicidal (but they want you to be), so they have an eternal apprehension for the future, as Donald Davidson would say.</p>
<p>Folks, the only joys in our future will be the equal opportunity suffering that the Diversity Curse metes out to our White enemies.     We embrace Equality- equal suffering for ALL Whites!<br>

		<p>Hmmm, 99.9% of everyone in prison for rape is male, can I call that discrimination? It&rsquo;s obvious that if police spent more time questioning females there would be more female rape suspects, right? Saying there are mostly non-white criminals because the police pay more attention to them is like saying New York City has more crime than Mayberry because NYC has more cops. Absurd. Cops don&rsquo;t create criminals.</p>

		<p>The solution is for black and hispanic cops to police black and hispanic neighborhoods.  White cops can never satisfy these miserable people.  I&rsquo;m glad that Ray Kelly mentions the racial breakdown of crime suspects.  They say black and hispanic kids learn better when the teachers look like them.  So, will blacks and hispanics behave better if policed by people who look like them? </p>

<p><br>
I doubt very much that they live in fear. What gives you that idea? On another forum some guy just got verbally roughed up for being racist and one female told him how ashamed she was for him. He had said nothing out of the ordinary and they jumped on him from all sides. <br>
Liberals have not seen the light, I doubt they will and when they hit bottom they will wonder what they did wrong. Maybe not apologize enough.  I wish you could see on the outside what is on the inside, in the case of liberals. </p>

		<p>Police, for the most part, go to where the crime is.  There is no evidence for ethnic equality in criminal activity.  There is infinite evidence of crimes rates differing by ethnicity.  Black-on-black murder vs. white-on-white murder comes to mind.  Rarely economic crimes, they serve as good baseline indicators.<br>
What is it with social engineers that they form a hypothesis of utopia and then force people to it.  Rather why not observe how people (and I dare say any simian) behave, and use that as a basis for understanding our inherent behavior.  </p>

		<p>A few weeks ago I read an article about car pedestrian collisions in Miami. The article stated that most of the pedestrian victims were Black and hispanic, but nowhere was it mentioned what the races of the offending drivers were. I guess it&rsquo;s all old Jewish retirees mowin&rsquo; down the poor innocent minorities.</p>

		<p>Let all Liberals sign a disclaimer with the police to show their support for such policies!<br>
So when a black man is raping/ sodomizing/ beating a man or woman, or when a she-boon is dragging a liberal woman across the floor of a Mc Diversity restarant,<br>
COPS WILL NOT RESPOND. <br>
After all, since blacks are less of the population, it is obviously unlikely they&rsquo;d commit any given crime. Soon we&rsquo;ll have harmony&hellip;and less libtards.</p>

		<p>Note that this sleeper agent of destruction is a federal judge.</p>
<p>Federal judicial rulings apply to the entire country.  The judicial supremacists will soon be applying this ruling to the entire country. Once a precedent is set, other judges must follow it.</p>
<p>New York City Whites are the most anti White, anti american Whites in the country.  Let them live with this decision.</p>
<p>Why, oh why in these stories about anti White judicial decisions don&rsquo;t the reporters ever mention the names of the law suit and the judge?</p>

<p>A couple of observations here. Since there is little or no crime in neighborhoods where judges, ACLU lawyers, professors, New York Times editors, CCR advocates, and whites in general live, we can pull all police patrols and responses from those neighborhoods. As a result, we can reduce the police force by 35% and save a lot of money.</p>
