<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Once and for all, people, it&rsquo;s an ice cream cone.</p>
<p>The owners of Ice Cream Family Corner and Sandwiches at the busy intersection of South Pine Avenue and Southwest 17th Street in Ocala say their two-month-old business is getting creamed because passers-by have mistaken their white-hooded ice cream cone mascot for a KKK protester.</p>
<p>Co-owner Jose Cantres says rumors are swirling on Facebook about the exact nature of the little vanilla cone, and employees heard through word of mouth that potential customers have steered clear of the shop to avoid the character.</p>
<p>Liza Diaz, who manages the store for Cantres and co-owner Jesus Diaz, said an employee at the bank where she does business told her a co-worker was so frightened by the white dollop patrolling the street corner that she called her husband crying and refused to drive through the intersection.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interestingly, Diaz, who is from Puerto Rico, had never heard of the KKK before this controversy. {snip}</p>
<p>Close up, the costume looks nothing like the white-hooded Klan garb that evokes such strong emotions. Its fluffy white top, flecked with colored sprinkles, curls slightly at its peak, and it sits atop a brown waffle cone.</p>
<p>But the costume tends to sag around the wearer&rsquo;s shoulders, and the waffle cone is mostly obscured by the sign the mascot holds in front of him. So to a motorist who gets only a glance cruising past at 40 mph, it can  &mdash;  and apparently does  &mdash;  look like a menacing Klansman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Mr. Diaz, a Puerto Rican, is said here never to have heard of the &#8220;K,&#8221; and doesn&rsquo;t know what the fuss is all about.</p>
<p>The reason for that is that Puerto Rico doesn&rsquo;t get a Spanish-dubbed MSNBC, nor does it have an ADL or SPLC.  </p>

		<p>This business sounds like its run by a clueless Hispanic family that has no idea of the complex (and bizarre) nature of black/white relations in this country.</p>
<p><i>a co-worker was so frightened by the white dollop patrolling the street corner that she called her husband crying and refused to drive through the intersection.</i> </p>
<p>Come on you people, it&rsquo;s a joke! (I&rsquo;m talking about the K, not the ice cream cone man.) The K has absolutely no power to strike terror into the hearts of anyone  &mdash;  it hasn&rsquo;t performed a lynching in well over half-a-century  &mdash;   except for the make-believe power the MSM has given it. It, along with &#8220;racism&#8221; is always a convenient bogeyman to bring out in any discussion of racial matters.</p>

		<p>More stupidity from my fellow Floridians. This is in the same manner of &#8220;oh, my God, I just voted for George Bush instead of Al Gore by mistake&#8221; or &#8220;I guess the phantom babysitter killed her and how&rsquo;d my dead baby end up in the woods?&#8221; Who knew the K night riders wore pants resembling waffle cones? Not to mention the fellow in the suit looks quite dark to me, either brown Hispanic or light-skinned black. The hypersensitivity of the sobbing black bank employee says it all. Irrational fear of a boogyman is greater than the actual risk of walking around in your own Ocala neighborhood at night. Who can forget the YouTube sensation from that same town, when a massive minority cat fight broke out at the Racetrac service station, resulting in a parking lot full of wigs, shoes, and tank tops? I don&rsquo;t know whether to laugh or cry. Reasonable people of Marion County, patronize that establishment with no fear.</p>

		<p>Your typical minority would get better treatment out of the local grand dragon of the K than Muslims from third world countries get in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>So, is this bank employee shaking in her boots because of real fear or because a minority family is showing a level of industriousness that she could never muster in a million years? </p>

		<p>Passers by were terrified that the first flavor listed was &#8220;vanilla&#8221;, and determined that this was a message that only white people should buy their ice cream, which resulted in a mass protest by people of color and white, hipster spoiled white kids.   A class action suit against the ice cream parlor by the ACLU for civil rights ice cream violation has been filed.</p>

		<p>Another reason that White men have fear in their hearts of the blacks. It USED to be that blacks had fear in THEIR hearts when they saw the K. FEAR kept blacks in line. They had respect for those they feared, not to cross the boundaries. </p>
<p>No longer. Whites are not allowed to even suggest that maybe times were better then for WHITES and AMERICA. Now look at us. Cowering in the shadows afraid to even use our freedom of speech (without editing it first) with the usual &#8220;buts&#8221;, &#8220;I am not a racist, I have black friends, we are not superior to others, we have oppressed others, our history &#8220;proves&#8221; we are &#8220;racists&#8221;, and on and on it goes. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the REAL K members would mistake me and my family for Black although we are the total opposite of them in our lifestyle.</p>
<p>Despite having skin dark as coal, I would feel FAR safer walking through a K rally than I would through any Black ghetto.</p>
<p>The worst the K could do was call me a &#8216;n  &mdash;    &mdash;  -&rsquo; while the Blacks in the ghetto would literally beat me to a painful, inhumane torturous death just for &#8216;acting white&rsquo;. Worst yet, I fear that would rape my innocent teenager daughter who will stay a virgin until marriage due to our conservative Indian culture that emphasizes family values. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe in God because it&rsquo;s no intelligent designer would design a smart, intelligent hard working race of Indians to have the same skin color as Blacks who commit such violent, horrific crimes. </p>

		<p>Only an IDIOT would think that costume looked like a K outfit.</p>
<p>Many years ago here in Tuscaloosa, AL, there were several competing dairies. One of them was named Perry&rsquo;s Pride. They asked a local commercial artist to come up with a cartoon character to use in promoting their products. In Persian mythology there is a friendly little elf known as a &#8220;Peri&#8221;. So the Peri was chosen as the cartoon representative of the company. Little Peris were painted on the sides of Perry&rsquo;s Pride trucks and used in other advertising. The little character looked like a Smerf with a little pointed beanie cap.</p>
<p>Immediately the other dairy companies started the rumor in the black part of town that Perry&rsquo;s Pride was owned by the K. Perry&rsquo;s Pride actually lost a lot of business because of this.</p>

		<p>There have been several comments on this thread asking the obvious question.</p>
<p>Posts with the three letter acronym of the organization that is part of this story, or with the full name of the organization, or the third word in the full name of the organization, are sent to the spam bin.  The reason is that those kinds of posts are almost always either attempts to recruit for that &#8220;organization,&#8221; or blatant incitements to future violence, or blatant glorification of its past violence.</p>
<p>Most posts seen in this story that refer to the org. as &#8220;K&#8221; were rescued from the spam bin, with the other &#8220;Ks&#8221; or the actual words edited out.  Some of you are already wise to this, and use just &#8220;K.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

Hey Sureesh, why don&rsquo;t we turn the clock back to the 1950&rsquo;s here in the UNITED STATES and &#8220;allow&#8221; you to &#8220;test that theory.&#8221;  I&rsquo;m quite sure that your &#8220;observations&#8221; would change quickly.

To anonymous poster @20:  I just want to say that I am a hard working, proud black man who happens to believe that North America could be a better place if it weren&rsquo;t for all of the RACIAL, POLITICAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, and SPIRITUAL ANIMUS!  I DO NOT subscribe to RACIAL SUPREMACY of any kind nor do I condone any ANTI-SOCIAL behavior exhibited by my less than enlightened black brethren.  I do believe that if the United States is going to survive as a country, ALL OF US will have to carry our own weight and make some serious modifications on how we do things today. WHITE LIBERALISM WILL HAVE TO BE DESTROYED!  White Liberalism/Marxism is a SATANIC social ideology that is designed to DIVIDE AND DESTROY this nation!  </p>
<p>If intelligent whites in this nation are serious about saving this country, they better get busy and stop hiding behind the keyboard.  Being armchair rangers and internet commandoes WILL NOT STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, JOB OUTSOURCING, AND HOME FORECLOSURES!  I say, since whites make up the majority of the US population and are the ruling elites, they are the ones who are going to have to step up to the plate and bring about the desired changes this nation needs. If you don&rsquo;t, JUST LOOK TO THE SOUTH OF CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA, AND TEXAS and picture what the US will look like in less than 15 years.  Just a thought poster #20. </p>
