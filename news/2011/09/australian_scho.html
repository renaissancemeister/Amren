<p>Bruce McDougall, Courier and Mail, September 5, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>School students are being targeted in a major new push to force acceptance of multiculturalism by &#8220;embedding&#8221; it in the national curriculum.</p>
<p>Young Australians will be trained in &#8220;cultural competency&#8221; during classes as part of the Gillard Government&rsquo;s plan to boost support for multiculturalism and outlaw negative attitudes.</p>
<p>Thousands of teachers have been surveyed about how the policy is working and to uncover racism under special research entitled &#8220;Rethinking Multiculturalism/Reassessing Multicultural Education&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s multi-pronged plan also involves sending 40 &#8220;People of Australia Ambassadors&#8221; into the community to spruik the benefits of multiculturalism and a new offensive against racism.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government, responding to 10 recommendations made by the Australian Multicultural Advisory Council, has agreed multiculturalism should be infused in the high school curriculum.</p>
<p>Australian teenagers should &#8220;understand and appreciate the value of other cultures&#8221;, the Government has decided.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will ensure that the development of students&rsquo; cultural competency in a globalised world is embedded into our national curriculum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Megan Watkins from the University of Western Sydney, who is researching multiculturalism in schools with the NSW Department of Education and Communities, said an aim was to help students become &#8220;culturally competent citizens&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular the complexity of what culture is needs to be better understood,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Professor Kevin Dunn from the UWS School of Sciences said the research was &#8220;not a post riots-type response&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no really serious alternative to multiculturalism as a means to deal with our cultural diversity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s good that the policy has been reconfirmed particularly given that internationally we have had some Western governments making statements against multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is racism, we know it, and that requires a response.&#8221;</p>
<p>Research shows about one in 10 Australians have racial supremacist beliefs and about the same number oppose inter-marriage and believe races should be kept separate.</p>
<p>A study by the Scanlon Foundation found about 9 per cent of Australians believed that &#8220;ethnic diversity erodes a country&rsquo;s security&#8221;.</p>
<p>In its submission to the federal parliamentary inquiry into multiculturalism, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet says the Government is &#8220;working to build a stronger, fairer nation through its social inclusion agenda&#8221;.</p>
