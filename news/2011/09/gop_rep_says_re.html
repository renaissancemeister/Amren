			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sarah Peters, The Hill, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A House Republican freshman on Tuesday night called on the federal government to step up enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, and said removing illegal immigrants is one way to create needed jobs for Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a surefire way to create jobs now for American citizens,&#8221; Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said on the House floor. &#8220;Evict all illegal aliens from America and immediately open up millions of jobs for unemployed Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eviction of illegal aliens from America has the side benefit of eliminating the abundance of cheap, illegal alien labor, which, in turn, forces blue-collar wages up, thus helping American families afford and pursue the American Dream.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Brooks and several other House Republicans said illegal immigrants commit violent crimes against law-abiding American citizens and that the federal government has failed to protect the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal aliens commit horrendous crimes against American citizens, crimes that strain state and federal judicial systems, police and sheriff departments and prisons that are already overcrowded in a financial crisis,&#8221; Brooks said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brooks and others called for the federal government to allow local law enforcement to help enforce immigration laws. Brooks spoke in favor of his Jobs for Americans Act, H.R. 2670, which would make that change.</p>

		<p>As much as this job needs to be done, what our economy really needs is jobs that actually produce a product that improves our GNP.  This is yet another government department that will have to be supported by tax payers.</p>
<p>Rather than opening another bureaucracy, we ought to not have our National Guard troops half way around the world, but here, working with extant police departments and other local authorities to secure our borders, return fire on those who fire into our nation from outside, and otherwise impose martial law ANYWHERE in the U.S. where &#8220;NO Go&#8221; zones for whites have been established.</p>
<p>However, the idea presented by Mo Brooks illustrates the level of frustration with the state of affairs and so it is well done.</p>

		<p>Please send Mr Brooks your thanks for bringing this up! Call his office, send emails or faxes. Look him up on the web. </p>
<p>Send calls, emails& faxes to the speaker of the house and the white house, lauding Rep. Brooks.</p>
<p>It may help!</p>
<p>We have to get behind the few politicians who support us.</p>
<p>Just think about it. We justifiably moan about being ignored.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our chance to make a difference, for a guy that is trying his best to help US.</p>
<p>Do it.</p>

		<p>All well and good, but we&rsquo;ll need to deport more than 125,000 of the invaders each and every month, as that is the number of green cards we issue in that time period.</p>

		<p>The Congressman has a terrific idea.  Of the estimated 12 million illegals here, if only 1 million are working, that would be a million more jobs for Americans, rather than illegal foreigners.  Deport those on welfare, and welfare expenses decline.  Because we believe in family unification, children born here to illegals, would be deported with them to keep their family intact.  The jailed illegals would serve their sentences, and then be deported.  Moreover, many more Americans could be employed, not building bridges, but a wall between the US and Mexico.  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  HM</p>

<p>FINALLY! Someone had the guts to address the CRIMES most of these illegals commit against Americans! Most Americans (Whites) think illegals &#8220;only do the jobs Americans won&rsquo;t do&#8221; because that has been shoved down their throats for decades now. Most illegals are criminals and drug pushers/users, not to mention alcoholics. Yes, even those so-called farm workers!</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s what I really think:  Deport the brown ones, legal or not. Keep the pale ones, legal or not. Legalism is the opiate of the white man.</p>

		<p>Rep. Brooks has a good idea but the BIG question is wether or not it WILL BE possible to enact and enforce it. As painful a truth as it may be, the truth is that those who hire illegal aliens (knowingly or unknowingly) do it in order to save money and to avoid paying taxes, insurance, etc. When they do this, they&rsquo;re not thinking about the damage they&rsquo;re inflicting on the Social Security system or anything else. All they are really thinking about is how to make their businesses thrive and their profits increase.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care. That would be easy to do. </p>
<p> We have to start somewhere. For the last 20 to 30 years NOTHING has been done about them and now we have about 30 to 40 million of them. All one has to do is stop all government aid, education, hospital care and jobs to illegals and they will leave on their own. Self deportation. </p>

<p>Someone who looked very much like an illegal alien, male 4ft8 pure indian features hit me with his car; hit and run of course.  I was a pedestrian.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m old enough for medicare.  He smashed many bones from waist to knees.  Medicare has paid about $200,000 in surgery.  Monthly Dr visits to several Drs cost more.  1 month in intensive care and 5 months in a nursing home cost more.  Nursing home was $260.00 per day. The hospital charges $8,000 per day for intensive care.</p>
<p>All paid by medicare and my supplemental insurance that costs only $40.00 per month.  Oh, I just remembered the monthly prescription medicines. Cost me $1.00 apiece.  Probably costs the taxpayer at least $50.00.  My meds cost from $120.00 to $271.00 for those without insurance.</p>
<p>1 hit and run accident.  1 illegal stone age indian alien.  Probably $400.00 so far and more to come.  I&rsquo;m 67.  My Mother is 94 and healthy.  I&rsquo;ll go into an assisted living, not a nursing home on the taxpayers dime soon. </p>
<p>1 hit and run accident. 1 illegal stone age indian alien.</p>
<p>Had  he been caught there would have been no insurance.</p>

<p>That is probably the number living in S. California.  There are probably around 100 million illegals in the country.</p>

		<p>This isn&rsquo;t about jobs, but speaking of immigration:</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s from last week&rsquo;s Border Patrol Blotter (and there&rsquo;s plenty more to be seen on the website):</p>
<p>US Border Patrol Weekly Blotter September 15 - September 21</p>
<p>Snips: <br>
Tucson Sector – Border Patrol agents arrested an illegal alien from Honduras near Gila Bend, Arizona. Records checks revealed the subject had a prior conviction for homicide and had been previously removed from the United States.</p>
<p>San Diego Sector – Border Patrol agents arrested an illegal alien from Mexico near San Ysidro, California. Records checks revealed the subject had an active warrant of arrest issued in the state of California for homicide.</p>
<p>Rio Grande Valley Sector – Border Patrol agents arrested an illegal alien from Mexico near Mission, Texas. Records checks revealed the subject had a prior conviction for 2nd degree murder and had been previously removed from the United </p>

		<p>None of us here, if we search our hearts, believe this will be done.  Not with out a civil war.  How else will we deal with the media that will beat the drum against even a start to repatriating illegals?  Or deal with the millions of Americans either too brainwashed to see what is best for themselves or the ethnic minorities that use illegals as a battering ram against us?  We all know it is too late for dreaming and niceities, ugly work is ahead for us.</p>
