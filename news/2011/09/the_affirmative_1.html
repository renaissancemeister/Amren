<h1>The Affirmative Action President, Yes Barack Obama &hellip;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Thy Black Man, August 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Imagine a future historian examining Obama&rsquo;s pre-presidential life: ushered into and through the Ivy League despite unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy non-job as a &#8220;community organizer&#8221;; a brief career as a state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in fact nearly devoid of his attention, so often did he vote &#8220;present&#8221;); and finally an unaccomplished single term in United States Senate, the entirety of which was devoted to his presidential ambitions.  He left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature legislation as legislator. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Not content to wait for history, the incomparable Norman Podhoretz addressed the question recently in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>:</p>
<blockquote>To be sure, no white candidate who had close associations with an outspoken hater of America like Jeremiah Wright and an unrepentant terrorist like Bill Ayers would have lasted a single day. But because Mr. Obama was black, and therefore entitled in the eyes of liberaldom to have hung out with protesters against various American injustices, even if they were a bit extreme, he was given a pass.</blockquote>
<p>Let that sink in: Obama was given a pass  &mdash;  held to a lower standard  &mdash;  because of the color of his skin.  Podhoretz continues:</p>
<blockquote>And in any case, what did such ancient history matter when he was also articulate and elegant and (as he himself had said) &#8220;non-threatening,&#8221; all of which gave him a fighting chance to become the first black president and thereby to lay the curse of racism to rest?</blockquote>
<p>Podhoretz puts his finger, I think, on the animating pulse of the Obama phenomenon  &mdash;  affirmative action.  Not in the legal sense, of course.  But certainly in the motivating sentiment behind all affirmative action laws and regulations, which are designed primarily to make white people, and especially white liberals, feel good about themselves. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, minorities often suffer so that whites can pat themselves on the back.  Liberals routinely admit minorities to schools for which they are not qualified, yet take no responsibility for the inevitable poor performance and high drop-out rates which follow.  Liberals don&rsquo;t care if these minority students fail; liberals aren&rsquo;t around to witness the emotional devastation and deflated self esteem resulting from the racist policy that is affirmative action.  Yes, racist.  Holding someone to a separate standard merely because of the color of his skin  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s affirmative action in a nutshell, and if that isn&rsquo;t racism, then nothing is.  And that is what America did to Obama.</p>
<p>{snip} As many have noted, Obama was told he was good enough for Columbia despite undistinguished grades at Occidental; he was told he was good enough for the US Senate despite a mediocre record in Illinois; he was told he was good enough to be president despite no record at all in the Senate.  All his life, every step of the way, Obama was told he was good enough for the next step, in spite of ample evidence to the contrary.  What could this breed if not the sort of empty narcissism on display every time Obama speaks?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In short: our president is a small and small-minded man, with neither the temperament nor the intellect to handle his job.  When you understand that, and only when you understand that, will the current erosion of liberty and prosperity make sense.  It could not have gone otherwise with such a man in the Oval Office. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Author&rsquo;s Note</strong>.  A lot of readers have written in asking me how I came to the conclusion that Obama was an unremarkable student and that he benefited from affirmative action.  Three reasons:</p>
<p>1)  As reported by <em>The New York Sun</em>: &#8220;A spokesman for the university, Brian Connolly, confirmed that Mr. Obama spent two years at Columbia College and graduated in 1983 with a major in political science. He did not receive honors&hellip;&#8221;  In spite of not receiving honors as an undergrad, Obama was nevertheless admitted to Harvard Law.  Why?  </p>
<p>2)  Obama himself has written he was a poor student as a young man.  As the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> reported, in:  </p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Obama&rsquo;s book &#8216;Dreams from My Father,&rsquo;&hellip;.the president recalled a time in his life&hellip;when he started to drift away from the path of success. &#8216;I had learned not to care,&rsquo; Obama wrote. &#8216;&hellip; Pot had helped, and booze; maybe a little blow when you could afford it.&rsquo; But his mother confronted him about his behavior. &#8216;Don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;re being a little casual about your future?&#8221; she asked him, according to the book. &#8216;&hellip; One of your friends was just arrested for drug possession. Your grades are slipping. You haven&rsquo;t even started on your college applications.&rsquo;&#8221;   </p>
<p>3)  Most damning to me is the president&rsquo;s unwillingness to make his transcripts public. {snip}</p>

		<p>Although the author appears to really get it, according to him it is still whitey&rsquo;s fault.  The transfer of power and wealth comes in many forms and giving the presidency to an unqualified black in just one of those forms.</p>

		<p>One more anecdotal piece of evidence that could have gone in the Author&rsquo;s Notes   &mdash;   Obama admitted to goofing off, cutting most of his classes, and caring about school only for being on the basketball team, during his last two years at what is said to be Hawaii&rsquo;s most prestigious and academically rigorous private high school.  Yet, somehow he graduated.</p>
<p>One more item proving Obama&rsquo;s affirmative action chops   &mdash;   He got virtually no opposition from his laughable Republican &#8220;opponent&#8221; in 2008, and I predict that he won&rsquo;t get much more from the same in 2012, because, as I have been saying all along, most white Republicans will shrivel up in cowardice when it hits them that they&rsquo;re implicitly asking the voters to take the Presidency away from the first black President and give it to him or her, a white person.</p>

		<p>Obama is kind of non-threatening, and he&rsquo;s moderate, for consensus and pro-American. What&rsquo;s of interest about Obama, what&rsquo;s amazing, audacious and certainly unprecedented is that Obama was a person of color rewarded for taking this stance. </p>

		<p>One of the best articles about Obama and why he was elected. His articulate and well spoken style is the main reason he got so far in life. My theory on his election was the media did as much as possible in 2006-2007 to proclaim Hillary Clinton as the front runner and leader in all opinion polls. It seemed like the mainstream media had basically told America that she would be the next president. Instead, people wanted change in the government and another Clinton presidency would not be change. I think voters took a chance on a somewhat unknown candidate in hopes of a different result.</p>

<p>WRONG!<br>
Stop the defeatist act. Slap yourself in the face, man. Wake up.<br>
Obama is headed for a massive defeat (Republican treachery notwithstanding).<br>
This country is in a shambles, and whites are getting it&hellip;up to their eyeballs.</p>
<p>BACK ANY VIABLE OPPONENT OF OBAMA! He WILL LOSE! Do not sit it out. Do not throw a vote away in protest. NO MORE BRA!<br>
 <br>
I keep saying it, and no one here comments&hellip;We can hold a Republican&rsquo;s feet to the fire once in office, showing them white votes are their  ONLY power. Reason being, Republicans merely worship money, and have no ideology. Wave cash in front of them, and they snap to attention.  We can never do that to  a black or a Mestizo, who make sport of hating us. Those people have passionate hatreds, and will never be swayed.<br>
Don&rsquo;t you see the difference? And the possibilities? <br>
Let me know.</p>

		<p>It is amazing as to how BHO is Black.  The only solid indications from his upbringing that race was of any salience in his life in the localities in which he lived, is that when he wanted something, he would pull out of his sleeve the matter that he was Black.  A team mate in high school reports having said to him something like this  &mdash;  &#8220;Hey, Barry, the coach didn&rsquo;t take you out of the game because you look Black  &mdash;  it was because you were missing too many shots!&#8221;  He can look good in two-dimensions. It&rsquo;s the missing depth that makes me a little shaky,.  </p>

		<p>i dont usually talk to blacks but i like to remind them that obama is more arab than black. blacks have small ears, obama has elephantine ears. his mom was &#8220;white&#8221; and his dad was of a tribe with heavy arab admixture. so he is less black than most american blacks. also, his dad&rsquo;s tribe was eastern african whereas west africans were the ones sold by the east african slave owners and traders, and west africans are the ancestors of blacks in america. this truth makes our opponents &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221;. hehe. he is not really president because he is inelegible, but he is still not americas first black prez, he is its first mixed whiteish/arab/black race prez.</p>

Hi Question, I&rsquo;m the anon that bushwhacked you.<br>
Right on the economy. No matter how lame  non race realists, or republican money changers are, Obama ist Kaput  in 2012, precisely because of the economy.<br>
But I IMPLORE you; <br>
Don&rsquo;t do what I did in fateful 2008: I let McInsane  fall, to send a message. I got&hellip;well, you know what I got.<br>
I would like your sincere analysis of what I stated; that Republicans are by far the race realists&rsquo; best bet, for they are only beholden to money and power.  They are a simple lot to manipulate and command. They have no ideology. We CAN tighten the screws on THEM. But Democrats? Socialists? Come on&hellip;They have a religious mission. And it&rsquo;s NOT the preservation of white culture&hellip;</p>
<p>Tell me, do you agree? If so, why, if not, why not?<br>
I&rsquo;d like some constructive discourse on amren, and not simply more of the (justifiable horror) at third world infection&hellip;</p>

		<p><i>One of the best articles about Obama and why he was elected. His articulate and well spoken style is the main reason he got so far in life.</i></p>
<p>He got far in life because he is black, the recipient of AA preferences and media favoritism. A well-spoken, articulate white male without any substance would have never made it as far as Obama has.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t release his transcripts or test scores.  His book &#8220;Dreams From my Father&#8221; was written by Bill Ayers but the media hide this as they hide MLKs plagiarism.  His &#8220;speeches&#8221; are written for him and he reads them off of a tele-prompter.  Obama is a fraud and a front man.  Complaints or tough questions are regarded by the media as examples of racism.</p>
<p><i>BACK ANY VIABLE OPPONENT OF OBAMA! He WILL LOSE! Do not sit it out. Do not throw a vote away in protest. NO MORE BRA!</i></p>
<p><i>I keep saying it, and no one here comments.</i></p>
<p>I agree with you.  I am SICK of the defeatist attitude I keep reading here and elsewhere and I am getting TIRED of IT.  Are these defeatists trying to tell us, &#8220;Oh well, there is nothing we can do, Obama&rsquo;s already as good as elected in 2012, and  white voters might as well stay home on election day?&#8221;  Is that what they&rsquo;re saying?</p>
<p>OR, are they working for Obama&rsquo;s re-election, putting out the message far and wide that &#8220;resistance to Dear Leader is futile?&#8221; (so you might as well not even bother to vote for his opponent).  This is what I&rsquo;m starting to believe.  Some of our worst enemies are other whites.</p>
<p>I usually vote third party, but not for the next presidential election; there is far too much at stake and soon we whites won&rsquo;t ever again have a chance at electing an  opponent to these white-hating Marxist ideologues who are wrecking our economy.</p>
<p>You are right:  Keep repeating your message everywhere possible   &mdash;    vote for Obama&rsquo;s opponent.  If Obama is elected to a second term, there may not be another chance.  If we whites don&rsquo;t hang together, Obama and his ilk will make sure we ARE hanged.</p>

<p>I see this same whiny defeatism all over the internet.  It may be coming from subversives hiding among us who seek Obama&rsquo;s reelection.  They&rsquo;re demonizing Republican candidates to either split the white vote, present Obama as a better alternative or convince us to sit out the election entirely.  Obama supporters will do anything to keep him in power including pretending to be &#8220;one of us&#8221; to get their candidate elected.</p>

<p>Excellent analysis of the situation and your assessment is spot on.  Pity so few see it.</p>

		<p>Would we prefer a higher IQ &#8220;White&#8221; liberal who actually got high grades at Columbia and Harvard Law School and published lots of scholarly work celebrating the War on Poverty, the Great Society, Civil Rights Marches in Chicago, the opposition to White rule in Rhodesia and South Africa?</p>
<p>Jared Taylor has to be about the last Yale/Harvard graduate I would trust on anything - there simply are no one on our side at these types of institutions, unless they are doing a great job of deception, majoring in obscure Egyptian studies, some science that hasn&rsquo;t been staked out to look for Conservatives, racist Whites. American academia is like life in Stalinist Russia - it&rsquo;s a great game to survive in high places.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll vote Republican this time around no matter who they put up.  I last voted for Reagan in a presidential election.  Like so many gullible Whites, I thought he might rein in affirmative action or at least enforce a quota system rather than &#8220;no Whites need apply.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead affirmative action got worse under Reagan, so I never voted again.  </p>
<p>But this time I will hold my nose and vote for any Republican.  It will probably be Rick Perry determined to merge America with Mexico.</p>
<p>Anyone who is aware of the massive election frauds and the power of ACORN in the large cities that control the states with the most electoral votes, knows the Republicans might very well lose because of vote fraud.</p>
<p>The Republicans seem to have some sort of death wish.  They know that academia, the media and the tax exempt foundations are solid Democrat.  Republicans could have done a few things to save themselves.  A Republican controlled congress could have ended the tax exemptions that fund the billion dollar liberal foundations.</p>
<p>If Republicans are so rich and privileged why have they abandoned the media to the liberals who would love to see a one party country ruled by Democrats forever?  </p>
<p>Why do all those rich and powerful Ivy League grads keep on donating millions to the colleges that teach hatred of Republicans and all Whites?</p>
<p>I have stopped wondering what is wrong with the Republican party.</p>
<p>A reasonable person would think that the Republicans are just a false flag party actually run by the Democrats.</p>

<p>I had to drink heavily before doing it, and again after I did it, but I did indeed ink in a circle next to the name &#8220;John McCain&#8221; on my Missouri 2008 Presidential ballot.  Not because I was voting for him, but because I was voting against having a black President.  Sarah Palin made the pain a little easier, but since then, she went and ruined her credibility.  But I still would have voted &#8220;for&#8221; McCain even if he had picked a leftist drip like Lieberman as his running mate.</p>
<p>Likewise, I&rsquo;ll do the same next year.  I won&rsquo;t be fooled into thinking that much of anything will get any better, though.</p>
<p><i>We CAN tighten the screws on THEM. But Democrats? Socialists? Come on&hellip;They have a religious mission. And it&rsquo;s NOT the preservation of white culture&hellip;</i></p>
<p>You make me think of the Tea Party Movement with those words.  It deserves a lot of criticism from our side of the aisle, and it gets it, even from me.  But I always come back to common sense   &mdash;   Why does the left wing hate it so much?  Maybe they&rsquo;re trying to trick us into supporting an egalitarian movement, but that would mean thousands upon thousands of left wingers are in on some vast head fake conspiracy, and that&rsquo;s just not possible.  The left wing and a lot of neo-cons hate the TPM for a reason   &mdash;   For all its faults, it is the most obvious clear and present threat in a long time to the way the ruling class does business.  As wrong-headed on race as most of the TPM leadership are, we can gain a lot in a &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; sort of way from TPM successes in the political arena.</p>

<p>You regret having allowed an Obama victory in &#8216;08 by refusing to vote for McCain.  But I don&rsquo;t think that you should have any such regrets.  Had McCain won, the country would have continued to slide to the left because there would have been no Obama to provoke the uprising of the Tea Party and much of the country.  The very epiphany that you believe whites have had thanks to Obama are in part due to the decision of you and many like you to punish the Republicans.  </p>
<p>I wish that I would have done the same.</p>

		<p>I agree with others on here that we can &#8220;hold their feet to the fire&#8221; if we get a moderate Republican in the White House. No dought those racisss &#8220;they want ussssssss, swinging from a tree&#8221; Tea Partiers will put many more conservatives in office in 2012 that will help - uh - &#8220;guide&#8221; him/her to the right. Just like the NAACP is currently holding Obamas feet to the fire now. I know how we feel on here about the TP folks but - THATS ALL WE&rsquo;VE GOT FOR NOW! I&rsquo;ve got three words to say to those of you that are thinking about sitting out the election if a moderate is nominated - THE SUPREME COURT! If Obama gets another 4yrs. and he gets to nominate acouple more liberal socialist justices, THAT is when we as White Americans will lose our country, THAT is when it will be game over. Who would YOU want to name those justices - a &#8220;moderate&#8221; Republican guided by the TP or Obama? The choice should be obvious!<br>
I also believe that if or when Obama loses, every major urban area in this country will experience massive rioting, property damage and loss of ( White ) life never before seen and that it  will be ordered by Obama himself - under the radar of course. Who&rsquo;s to say that these &#8220;flash mobs&#8221; going on all over the country lately aren&rsquo;t practice runs? Has he EVER spoken out against them? No, he hasn&rsquo;t and he won&rsquo;t because those are going to be his &#8220;foot soldiers&#8221; that he will need later on. I think he will be a VERY sore loser. I just hope they take the &#8220;black box&#8221; with the codes away from him the minute he loses. I wouldn&rsquo;t put anything past that Kenyan Muslim!<br>
 White liberals will be the ones that will suffer the most because alot of them just love to live in those &#8220;vibrant communities with diverse cultures&#8221;. Sadly, alot of them will be assaulted/slaughtered in the chaos while wearing their &#8220;Obama in 2012&#8221; t-shirts!           </p>

<p>I agree with you about the Republicans. They have been completely neutered and emasculated. They have no interest in the white middle class. They only care about staying in power and lining their pockets. I posted this on another website a few days ago. I basically compared today&rsquo;s Republicans to the neutered conservative party of the former communist East Germany: </p>
<p>&#8220;When the Soviet union occupied Germany and set up a brutal communist dictatorship, the conservatives (CDU) were allowed to exist in name. They were given no real power, however. They were a small group of spineless &#8220;yes men&#8221; who blindly obeyed the communists and tried to convince other conservatives to do the same. That reminds me of what is happening to our Republican Party. The new democrats are mostly far left, third world Marxists. The Republicans pander to the Dems in any way they can, in order to desperately hold on to their waning power. They have completely abandoned any loyalty to traditional American values.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Two more affirmative action figures: Condoleezza Rice and Colin Powell. Both were decent-enough-people who were promoted to above their compentence level, just as Obama was, in the name of having a black face at the top. Both Rice and Powell were talked about as future presidents - in particular Powell. Nothing came of that. Rice and Powell were never elected to anything. Both left no mark. Unlike other former government people who pop up on TV all the time, the media don&rsquo;t interview Rice and Powell anymore because they have nothing to say. </p>

President Obama seems very convincing (as in the recent speech ), but many &#8220;con men&#8221; have the capacity momentarily to persuade both others and themselves, then, unlike most of us, to dissociate from it all and maybe within themselves  to be quickly, if privately, amused by it all .  Yet they themselves remain impressed with their initially persuasive and initially sincere  performance.  Relevant?  Let&rsquo;s hope not.</p>
