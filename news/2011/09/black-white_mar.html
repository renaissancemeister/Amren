			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zhenchao Qian, EurekAlert, September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new study of interracial marriages in the United States since the 1980s suggests that the racial boundary between blacks and whites continues to break down  &mdash;  but is not yet close to disappearing.</p>
<p>Marriages between African Americans and whites increased rapidly between 1980 and 2008, outpacing the rate of unions between whites and other ethnic and racial groups, including Latinos, Asian Americans and American Indians.</p>
<p>Still, the total number of marriages between blacks and whites continues to be much smaller than those between whites and other racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of marriages between whites and African Americans is undeniably increasing rapidly, but it is still a small number,&#8221; said Zhenchao Qian, lead author of the study and professor of sociology at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>In 1980, only 5 percent of black men married a white woman, but that increased to 14 percent in 2008. Still, by comparison, 38 percent of Asian American men and Hispanic men married a white woman in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our results point to better race relations in 2008 than 1980, but we still have a way to go,&#8221; Qian said. &#8220;The racial boundary is blurred, but it is still there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Qian conducted the study with Daniel Lichter, professor of policy analysis and management and sociology at Cornell University. Their results appear in the October 2011 issue of the Journal of Marriage and Family.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of this new study is that it uses data on new marriages begun each year between 1980 and 2008. That allows the researchers to see how marriages are reacting to current social conditions, according to Qian. Most studies use data on all marriages  &mdash;  including couples who married decades ago, when their marriage market was very different from that of today.</p>
<p>The study uses data from the 2008 American Community Survey, which is an ongoing survey of American households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The survey includes about 3 million people a year. The researchers also use data from the 1980 U.S. census.</p>
<p>Understanding changes in interracial marriages is complex because it involves two different factors: the marriage market of who is available to marry and also individuals&rsquo; choices about who they would be willing to marry.</p>
<p>Those two factors tell somewhat different stories, Qian said.</p>
<p>Overall, while marriages between blacks and whites showed large increases between 1980 and 2008, there was only a slight increase in marriages between whites and Hispanics. This period also marked the end of the long-term rise in marriages between whites and Asians.</p>
<p>Much of this can be explained by large increases in immigration of Hispanics and Asians into the United States, the study revealed.</p>
<p>This has meant that Hispanics and Asians living in the United States now have a larger pool of potential marriage partners from their own racial and ethnic groups. Indeed, results showed that marriages between U.S. born and foreign born Asians and Hispanics increased rapidly between 2000 and 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the enormous growth of the immigrant population, Asians and Hispanics now have more opportunities than ever to find a marital partner who shares the same cultural background. Such marriages reinforce their cultural identity,&#8221; Lichter said.</p>
<p>However, when the researchers calculated what would have happened if the size and characteristics of minority populations hadn&rsquo;t changed between 1980 and 2008, they found intermarriage rates would have actually increased rather than decreased or stayed the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;That suggests that any evidence of a retreat from interracial marriages is mostly a reflection of changing marital market opportunities, rather than changes in whom people are willing to marry,&#8221; Lichter said.</p>
<p>But Lichter noted that the experience of blacks living in the United States was different from that of Latinos and Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&rsquo;t a great increase in black immigrants into the United States, so the rise in black-white intermarriages really suggests greater racial tolerance and a new openness to marrying outside one&rsquo;s own race. This suggests a weakening of the racial boundaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>One noticeable change was the role of education in interracial marriages. For many years, highly educated Hispanics and Asian Americans have been more likely than their less educated counterparts to marry whites. But that was never true for blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to be that race trumped everything, including education, when it came to marriage between blacks and whites,&#8221; Qian said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is changing. For the first time, we found that highly educated blacks and whites were more likely to intermarry. That is very significant and is another sign that racial boundaries are blurring.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study also examined trends in biracial and cohabiting Americans.</p>
<p>The study found that people who classified themselves as white-Asian or white-American Indian were more likely to marry whites than Asians or American Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rise in America&rsquo;s multiracial population blurs racial boundaries,&#8221; Lichter said.</p>
<p>However, black-white biracial people are still more likely to marry blacks than whites.</p>
<p>In general, the results were similar in cohabiting couples as they were in married couples. However, interracial couples were slightly more likely to be in cohabiting unions than they were to be married, according to the findings.</p>
<p>Qian said the study suggests that, when it comes to marriage, &#8220;ethnic and racial boundaries are being crossed, especially among men and women with college education.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the increasing immigrant population also means that many minorities in the United States, particularly Asian Americans and Hispanics, will have a greater opportunity than ever to marry within their ethnic or racial groups, he said.</p>

		<p>I see black male/ white female couples like every day.  I don&rsquo;t want to rain on anyone&rsquo;s love parade, so I remain neutral.  What I have noticed is that a) the white women are almost ALWAYS overweight and b) any kids I see tend to look black.</p>
<p>I see white male / asian female couples also frequently.  I have never actually seen an asian man with a black, white or latino female.</p>

		<p>Well, I can report two that I know of personally that failed.  Of all of them making up the stat, more than half without a doubt failed. But the real tragedy is that in almost every case, they did not fail until after children were produced.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, black-white biracial people are still more likely to marry blacks than whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>This stat indicates that the white population is being eliminated through intermarriage.  This is the declared aim of Tim Wise, Feminists, and other sundry &#8220;Obama baby&#8221; white assassins.</p>

		<p>Please see my brief remarks under &#8220;Record-High 86% Approve of Black-White Marriages&#8221;, September 12, 2011.</p>
<p>One minor point for now: Panmixia involving populations of substantially different average IQs would tend to result in a population of a midway IQ level, dropping the extremes at each end so to speak. Theoretically, random crossing within a closed area would eventually tend to lose the specialised extremes created by evolutionary selection in times past, e.g. lower the number of very gifted people, and there would be a negative counter-evolutionary effect all round.  It is said, however, that assortative mating (like with like) would rule this out, since e.g. clever blacks would only marry clever whites and vice-versa.  But today there are countervailing cultural pressures, e.g. affirmative-action colleges bring together less able blacks with brighter whites in a social atmosphere that encourages sexual congress.  The physical attraction of black males (&#8220;organ&#8221; size, dancing skills, sweet-talking gifts) works wonders on white girls whom they target, who also conform psychologically to &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; sensitivity.  Later abandonment of mates by some black men (right down the social scale) leaves their hybrid children with the combined problems of fatherlessness and identity, a contributory factor to gang membership in mixed urban areas. In 1961 the fear was that girls would consider it their Christian duty to marry and &#8220;mother&#8221; the poor persecuted black boys; in 2011 the fear is that the unchristian hedonism of sex, drugs and rock &amp; rap will draw the unchaperoned teenage girls into a similar misfortune, with blacks given an alpha-male treatment by the sports &amp; entertainment media.  In Britain &#8220;hate-speech legislation&#8221;, plus control of press, TV and academic literature, prevents discussion of these particular issues, so that even if I am wrong I must not be openly refuted! The US is fortunate to have journals like Mankind Quarterly protected by free speech.  </p>
<p>A century ago miscegenation was frowned upon and legally prohibited in some areas; today merely to question its desirability is subject to comparable restraints in most areas.     </p>
<p>This is certainly a subject of great complexity that needs a fresh comprehensive study from the viewpoint of biological and social science. Once the &#8220;experiment&#8221; is undertaken on a massive scale, it cannot be undone.<br>

<p>The offspring of mixed marriages will either return to their race like Obama did, or they will seek white mates and have another generation of brown eyed, olive skinned children of undeterminable race and culture.</p>

<p>In my limited experience, there are two types of women who fall for the charms of the blacksnake, 1) women who fear that they can&rsquo;t get a white man due to some combination of fat, ugly, and low-class, and 2) women who have serious &#8220;Daddy issues.&#8221; But these classifications lack the power to explain the increase in miscegenation since 1980; until I hear a better explanation, I&rsquo;m going with mass media influence.</p>
<p>So, how do we as parents inoculate our children from the influence of Hollywood&rsquo;s ubiquitous promotion of miscegenation? </p>

		<p>So Asians and Mexicans have more of an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to marry their own&hellip;but whites have more of an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to marry blacks??? Thanks a lot!! They didn&rsquo;t seem to give actual numbers, as this stuff can be very confusing.  Maybe the greater number of black males in prison reduces the marriage between black males and females,so the black male/white female pairing grows by comparison.  I don&rsquo;t know, its all kind of sickening.</p>

		<p>My own observation is that black men are extremely pushy, aggressive and manipulative in chasing white women. Most white women are somewhat naive when dealing with blacks and often get roped in by the charm blitz. Usually they&rsquo;re sorry later when the charm wears off. Something should be done to warn these unsuspecting women early on that they have every right to say no thanks to these characters. </p>

		<p>Ah yes. Classic jibber jabber about inter-racial marriage and unions. Notice how the left only likes positive stories when discussing the White displacement of a truly American orthodox? In other words, usually negativity and depravity dominate the &#8220;hair-brain stream media&#8221;. All the gore and carnage you can handle on any given murder story in any given sleepy Midwestern town (you see the Whiter the area, the more dirt on the story). And actually the liberals love the idea of divorce. So I find it funny that the left falls all over itself to report marriage statistics. </p>
<p>So the ironic part is that while the women&rsquo;s liberation movement encouraged women that they didn&rsquo;t need a male in their lives, a black male would be ideal. As you can see in the local neighborhood crime reports, how&rsquo;s thay working out?</p>

<p>5% of Black men married White women in 1980.  Today it&rsquo;s 14%.  &#8220;We still have a long way to go&#8221; he said.  In other words what he&rsquo;s really saying is that we have a long way to go to destroy the White race completely through miscegenation.  Apparently that&rsquo;s the real goal here - to get rid of White people through miscegenation.  The incredible rise in White women/Black men combinations is due almost completely to media conditioning of the minds of young White girls.</p>

		<p>I would to if I was Black. Black women in the real world, not on some sit-com, are overweight to a shocking degree, are very bossy and demanding, and most of all are very unpleasant to everyone around them.<br>
I used to own Restaurants/bars in the Bay Area. It got to the point that the service workers would not even wait on them. They would eat their whole meal than demand a refund for some reason. They would refuse to tip and would treat the waiters/waitresses like dirt. I had to wait on them myself for fear of getting sued, and boy I had to hold my tongue. The reality of them compared to what they are like in the movies is incredible. Could you imagine living with them! However I imagine Black men are no bargain themselves.</p>

		<p>Two types of people date interracially imo. One type are the kind that has difficulties either being accepted by their own race or accepting their own race. The other are the type that negatively stereotype their own race and positively stereotype others, or simply have sexual fetishes about certain other races.</p>

<p>I think it used to be called &#8220;Finishing School.&#8221;  But certainly, some sort of instruction in picking out suitable dating material is needed to counter the continuous MSM onslaught of pressure to go for the &#8220;bad boy&#8221; and all the subtle pressure to miscegenate.  A manual produced by some pro-white org might help.  They could be distributed everywhere from bus stations to airports the way religious tracts used to be.  Or wait, canvass distribution in the way Jehova Witnesses leave their tracts at your door even after you say &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the hard times of the last few years my eyes have been opened to how financially lucrative a liberal political stance has been. Maybe this mixing is just a way of white people proving their liberal bona fide!</p>

<p>In Florida most young married are black and white.  Today only Black men are being hired while White men are joining the unemployment numbers.  If a women wants to have kids and a family she is forced to marry a black man.  In shopping malls around the nation, you now see mostly white women with Obama breed kids walking with Black men.  </p>

		<p>My parents made it clear that I was to never bring a black man home. Furthermore I was to steer clear of blacks as friendship material as well. I was warned that if I had black friends (of either sex) that I would gain a reputation that would not reflect very well on me or them. A friend also told me that &#8220;once you go black you will never go back&#8221;. Unfortunately when girls start dating blacks they almost never again end up with a white man. When you see the overweight and unsightly white women with black men they have probably had their heads so messed with by black men that they are uncapable of anything else.</p>

 Its about 50,000 white women with white husbands compared to 390 white women with black husbands.

<p>Once a white woman has a child with a black male the black male is MIA. Just ask Obama.</p>
<p>There should be public service announcements stating: </p>
<p>&#8220;Thinking of being with a black man? I guess you are also thinking of being a single mother too.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;You think dating a black man is cool? I guess living in poverty must be cool too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like poverty?  Then you will love black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Want to never see your black boyfriend again?  Just have a child with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abuse and poverty come in shades of black.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I dislike the general idea of interracial marriage, although because I believe in complete freedom of association I oppose government bans on it. Interracial marriage should be like abortion: safe, legal, and rare.</p>
<p>With that said, let&rsquo;s remember that there are great differences between the non-white races, just as there are great differences between Whites and non-whites. Not all forms of interracial marriage are equally harmful. A White male/black female marriage, for example, is more harmful than a White male/East Asian female marriage because the latter will produce triple-digit IQ children, while the former will not. In turn, a black male/White female marriage is more harmful than one with the sexes reversed because in a White male/black female marriage, the children will at least have a responsible father figure around. </p>
<p>The black male/White female pairing is by far the most harmful of any interracial match. It is no coincidence that it is precisely this particular pairing that is being crammed down our throats by the Communist-controlled media. Whenever an interracial couple is shown in a movie, on a TV show, in an advertisement, etc., it is this particular pairing 95% of the time. It is entirely appropriate to focus our attention on stopping the glorification of this type of couple. It&rsquo;s the only kind really being glorified, anyway.</p>

		<p>Proff Richard Lynn in &#8220;Race Differences in Intelligence&#8221; (purchased on Amren) makes the note that Portugal was the only European nation to import Blacks (for agricultural labour) in any numbers, some 20% of Madrid&rsquo;s population being Black in the 16th century.  This he postulates explains Portugals relatively low IQ level compared to the rest of Europe.  Portugals navigators and explorers once discovered, traded with and colonised much of the new world.  Now they are one of the PIGS  causing a monetary crisis in the EU.</p>

		<p>Another article of doomsday.<br>
What matters is the interracial marriages of whites, not blacks(who are five/six times fewer).</p>
<p>About 5 % of all newly weds who were white last year married interracially. That&rsquo;s nothing. Bother me when the number&rsquo;s at 50 % like it is in the Jewish community.</p>
<p>The issue is mass immigration(and the reversal, not merely stopping, of it), not intermarriage. <br>

		<p>My blond ( really blonde not bottle)good-looking Germanic style 2nd cousin with large breasts,ran off with a black man from LA at a young age and had his half black son.<br>
 She let him cheat on her and beat her but only left when he attacked his infant son.<br>
 Her son now beats his wife, is  really angry and not part of our family.<br>
 I dont appreciate that she brought her son into our gene pool but at least her second son was all white. I dont know if she is intelligent enough to realize why she put herself through that and still was civil to the BB, but it seems that small town girls from Kelso wa are prone to black men.<br>
 My friend who came from the same area had an obsession with black men, because she thought she was getting away from loggers with bad teeth.<br>
 I was liberal then and so did not comment except to say: dont marry him, have his baby, pool money with him, or let him live with you. she did everything I told her not to and I had to drive her to the doctor when she hemorrhaged after the birth of little half black baby.<br>
 so she went ahead and married an illegal alien from latin american who was coal black and cheated on her with every white woman he could. She also bilked,you the taxpayer, a hundred thousand or more, because her half black baby, whom she liked better then her blonde blue eyed kids, was a medical nightmare and she was on welfare. She was also fat but beautiful in a dolly parton way.<br>
another friend of mine took up with a black man from africa, who also cheated on her with her friends.<br>
 none of these women date black men anymore, but they all caused problems and brought little Barack Obama&rsquo;s into the gene pool.<br>
 now I realize what  a huge mistake it all was.</p>

		<p>I personally disagree with interracial marriage. Interracial marriages have much higher rates of domestic violence and divorce. And it undermines the culture, heritage and values of those involved. But as much as I oppose the practice, it doesn&rsquo;t pay to get hysterical. So try to maintain a little composure in lieu of all the hand-wringing. </p>
<p>Women aren&rsquo;t falling for the &#8220;charms&#8221; of black men. In fact, there are numerous studies showing that it is MEN who are most willing to date interracially. Most women do NOT want to. In fact, very few women would even consider it. </p>
<p>From a biological point of view it makes sense. Women should be pickier than men because they carry most of the risks. There will always be exceptions but, for the most part, women who date interracially tend to fall into one of three categories. </p>
<p>First, they can&rsquo;t find a suitable man of their own race because they&rsquo;re fat, ugly, stupid, etc. Second, they&rsquo;ve had a very bad experience with men of their own race such as violence, rape or coming from an abusive home. Or, third, they&rsquo;re a gold-digger who hits the jackpot.</p>

		<p>So-called Black-White marriages are reality but what about Black-White divorces? Do these marriages last? Do the so dissimilar backgrounds make strong family coalitions or are the woman that enter these unions separated from their former families because of the interracial nature of the joining together of such different milieus? These questions are also interesting and need to be explored.</p>

		<p>Yet people&rsquo;s lives aren&rsquo;t getting any better. Poverty is at its highest in almost 20 years, unemployment is increasing every year, the cost of living is going up, and more and more government spending is keeping the U.S. at the very top of the list of most indebted countries. See the correlation? Liberals have their head in the clouds about superficial mythological nonsense like interracial marriage as a distraction from other more serious issues  &mdash;  crime, poverty, and debt  &mdash;  which are too scary or complicated for them to deal with.</p>
<p>And not a word in the article about divorce rates, which have gone up from 1980-2008 as well. While, like Taylor, I have a &#8220;free association&#8221; principle and don&rsquo;t interfere with someone else&rsquo;s bad decisions I still hold the strong opinion that interracial marriage, whatever combination of races, is <i>dangerous and volatile</i>. Seems innocent and well-intentioned to the naive college freshman on the surface, but a dreadful everlasting mistake to the 40-year-old divorced father or mother of three.</p>

		<p>The primary statisitic that counts, from our point of view, is the number of White women (and men, a new objective of the race destroyers) having children with Blacks whether it be within marriage or without. Of equal importance is whether resultant mullatos marry White, Biracial or Black.  Since mullatos tend to marry other biracials they tend not to assimilate into the White gene pool as much as they assimilate into the black one.</p>
<p>To us, the main loss would seem to be a loss of fertillity.</p>
<p>Mudsharking, as it&rsquo;s known colloqially, is unfortnatly not confined to the lower socio-economic or even low cognitive groups as disasterous marriages such as that Tiga Woods with Elin Nordegren and OJ Simpson with the murdered bv him Nicole Simpson (Née Brown) shows.  Mr President Obongo&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s bigammous marriage didn&rsquo;t end well either.</p>
<p>The propensity of White males to marry East Asian women is on the surface not harmfull to our race. In terms of IQ decline and the resultant crime, low productivity, poverty there is nothing to fear and many, such as conservative Michelle Malkin, implicitly resent the diversity gravy train and the debillitations it produces as well.  The knock on effect however is that for every White male partnering with an Asian female a White female is left without a White partner.</p>
<p>In general there is an undersupply of elligble White males.  The tendancy of females to want to marry &#8216;up&rsquo; and the tendancy of males to be less concerned with status leads to a situation where the least married groups are high status accomplished females and low status males.</p>
<p>One way we can beat this is just to drive high White fertillity.</p>

		<p>This is terrible news.<br>
I beieve genetic science shows that European descended women and African descended men differ in their haplotypic profiles at virtually every locus - to the extent that any White woman who has borna child with a black is more closely related to a White stranger than her own child!<br>
 The phenomenom must be seen globally in this context.<br>
Anyhow it is significant how White women will prove to be the pall-bearers (rather than the life-givers) of the White race.I can already hear the howls of protest from female Amren enthusiasts, but facts are facts.<br>
 Another point made by the late, great Glayde Whitney, a distinguished former Amren contributor, is that the mark of &#8216;dominance&rsquo; of one peoples over another since the dawn of time, is of the transfer of women, money and power from one group to another.It is evident who&rsquo;s winning this contest.</p>

		<p>#1 Wild Bill makes an excellent point in that too many white men would rather fantasize than date and ultimately marry.  Popular culture now teaches American males that a woman must look like a model to be desirable or acceptable, and if an overweight male believes he cannot be seen with a comparably overweight female, then he likely won&rsquo;t.  He&rsquo;ll believe that no culturally acceptable woman will have him, so he&rsquo;ll resort to online fantasy.  Most black men obviously don&rsquo;t buy into this and will date overweight women.  Of course, in almost all cases, they don&rsquo;t marry them.  <br>
When I was young, almost all women of all races married.  And, as for fatness, watch old movies and observe who were usually cast as spinsters.  It was skinny women.</p>

Not that white males would want it to be called as such but why is the mixed mutt always called black and never white yet they get all their good genes from the white? </p>
<p>Is Obama not the result in 1962 of a white female and African black male reproduction to even up as president? <br>

		<p>I think that drugs are the main reason for race mixing. If you look at where people eat and drink you will find that blacks still have their own restaurants and bars. Drugs are different, when people are looking for drugs they will buy from anyone and associate with anyone. The one area where black men are good providers is when it comes to drugs. </p>

		<p> I have heard that years ago, a woman with big hips was considered a good catch. It  seemed practical for bearing children and doing farm work.  I imagine some of that philsophy lingered for awhile and then faded out after the advent of MSM. Young white girls are influenced to look emaciated and be childless for as long as possible.  Miscegenation is constantly drilled into their skulls. I was watching an old episode of SNL last night&hellip;Ricky Martin was singing La Vida Loca. In the background, a blond woman was dirty dancing with a black guy.  The propaganda is so obvious and trite, it&rsquo;s not even shocking anymore. I&rsquo;ve even heard black commentators mock this &#8220;social engineering&#8221;.  The mainstream media obviously tries to emasculate white males, even in advertising.  The problem starts at childhood. White boys are force fed anti-depressants and brainwashed that they are evil. Adolescence extends well beyond college years into their 30&rsquo;s. Some sexed up white women mate with blacks to satisfy their maternal and sexual urges. They avoid some white guys, becaus it&rsquo;s hard to have sex with a stoner who is always masterbating to internet porn.  I can&rsquo;t blame white males for their external enemies, but I do blame them for immaturity and not fighting back.  </p>
<p>Here in California, I see way too many 30 year old &#8220;skater kids&#8221;. They play video games, obssess over internet porn, smoke dope with their &#8220;frat brothers&#8221;&hellip;.at 28-30 something. That is pathetic. When I was younger, such a person would be a laughing stock, a loser. When my parents were young, most were already married with children by age 22.  There was no time for smoking dope, porn fantasies or &#8220;jungle fever&#8221;. </p>
<p>Third world cultures do not give their boys riddilin, etc. They rarely abort their babies, they have no problem mating and bearing children at a young age&hellip;.especially where the government pays for everything. Macho, vioelent, hypersexual behavior is encouraged. They don&rsquo;t encourge self-genocide like whites do. </p>
<p>I suggest to white parents: if your boy is &#8220;overactive&#8221;, don&rsquo;t emasculate him with drugs. Most anti-depressants actually inhibit testosterone. You are partially castrating him with those awful drugs. If he is aggressive, teach him to properly channel his aggression into martial arts and academics. (I know that&rsquo;s easier said than done).</p>
<p>To young white males I say, WAKE UP! Stop smoking dope and listening to gangsta rap. If you actually listen to the lyrics, these people HATE you. They want to take EVERYTHING from you. Learn how to fight, stand by your women, and educate yourself. It is cool to find the right woman of your dreams and settle down with them, have kids. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a prison sentence.  A real life with love, romance, and children is much better than a porn fantasy. Also, real men fight back when they are being opressed. LEARN HOW TO FIGHT.</p>
<p>To all white folks, I urge you: bombard the mainstream media with emails and calls, whenever they air something offensive toward whites (which is always). It actually helps. Sears pulled a risque interracial Christmas ad after several angry calls. Even one person can make a difference. I recently contacted the miliatry channel, and asked them to pull an ad that included gangsta rap lyrics. I advised them that WWII veterans watching the program might find such music offensive&hellip;imagine? To my knowledge they did pull the ad.</p>
<p>We are undergoing genocide from all fronts: verbal, psyhcological and physical attacks. We must fight like hell and take our future back. Fight back in anyway you can. Hurting or killing innocents is cowardly, that is what our enemies do.  Please don&rsquo;t think that way, but do kill the man who attempts to rape or murder us.  Fighting and boycotting liberal media is a given.  Also, stop sedating yourself. Throw the beer and weed away. Get up off of the couch, do some pushups, go to the shooting range, do a few rounds in the ring.  At this point we must focus on winning the race war that has been declared on us.</p>

		<p>A lot of white women, I am sad to say, are attracted to blacks because they are brutal and thus, in their own crazy minds, sexual.  A lot of white &#8220;men,&#8221; actually enjoy this.  I can attest to the fact that there are number of websites exclusively devoted to white couples in which the wife/girlfriend cuckolds her partner by taking up with a black man   &mdash;   and the white man LOVES the humiliation.  I mean some explicit stuff, too.</p>
<p>This problem isn&rsquo;t caused by &#8220;Hollywood&#8221; or &#8220;the media.&#8221;  That&rsquo;s baloney.  Try and imagine what Sly Stallone, Bruce Willis or Clint Eastwood would say about such &#8220;men.&#8221;  The real problem is a hybrid:  feminism and the desire for sexual domination.  It&rsquo;s time for white men to stand up to our women and tell it like it is.  Call it &#8220;a national conversation on sex.&#8221;    </p>

<p> I can&rsquo;t agree with your premise&rdquo;Wild Bill&rdquo; because the rate of white females on anti-depressants is even higher than white males. If &#8220;biological imperatives&#8221; were the only reason white women sought men, they could go to the sperm bank and avoid all the hassles.</p>

		<p>Common sense observation would be- &#8220;bleaching&#8221; is the goal. White-Asian &amp; White-American Indian biracials tend to marry &#8220;White&#8221; in order to completely assimilate, &#8220;bleach out&#8221; so to speak.</p>
<p>Life is tougher for White-Black biracials. The &#8220;lighter&#8221; ones, more or less, try to marry White (Jeniffer (Flashdance) Beals). The darker or more black biracials seem to have been left with multiracial and Black options, in any case, predominantly non-White.</p>

		<p>I see a lot of white male bashing here. Supposedly 16% (Sources? Studies? Factual claims?) are on antidepressants. Still greater numbers are &#8220;online fantasists&#8221;. And many of the rest of us are with Oriental women.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t discount the effect of decades of gay propaganda either.  Between the image of black masculinity in the MSM &amp; the gay white male role model of film, video &amp; print ads, heterosexual white men have to turn to the past for inspiration.  Exposure to older movies, like those of Gary Cooper &amp; John Wayne can help a lot.  Young men can also gain strength from our religious traditions that teach the superiority of the man whose spiritual growth trumps his bodily appetites.  </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t have (proper) TV in my home, and I haven&rsquo;t since 1995. The OJ thing was all over the tube then, and I wanted to avoid that silliness and the all of the subliminal messages that we are fed 24/7. </p>
<p>If I see a film now with a black male stud having his way with a smoking hot white female, well, I don&rsquo;t finish watching it. I don&rsquo;t see blacks excelling in sports as I don&rsquo;t watch that foolishness. </p>
<p>I visit Amren and like-minded web sites. I watch my recorded films (which I KNOW don&rsquo;t include sickening miscegenation). I listen to White artists and watch White films. </p>
<p>And I most certainly don&rsquo;t want to watch erotic miscegenation films. When I was a kid, I found an older white male relative&rsquo;s videocassette entitled &#8220;White Women who Love Black&hellip;.&#8221; (I must omit the last words.) I was shocked that this man, whom I admired and who had a beautiful White wife, would be &#8220;turned on&#8221; by such a thing. I wasn&rsquo;t. I never have been. I mention this fellow because he, like MSNBC&rsquo;s Chris Matthews, gets a &#8220;tingle up his leg&#8221; over Obama. </p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up with the White American men who get effusive and gooey over black men? They should absolutely be ashamed of themselves. </p>

		<p>  I would say that far more mixed race children of black/white pairings are born out of wedlock than in wedlock. The 14% figure would be on the low end of the spectrum for black/white pairings here in America. </p>
<p>More mulatto children of these mixed couplings identify with the pathological black hip/hop or gangster culture than white culture.  In addition, many mulattos have problems adapting to society in general and have higher rates of sociopathic behavior than do whites.</p>
<p>All in all, this does not bode well for a stable society in the future. Alas, there is little we can do about it. We live in a free country, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want our government to dictate who you should be sleeping with. After all, racially conscious whites basically want to be left alone to live their private lives outside of coercive government regulations. <br>

		<p>Several posts here touch on &#8220;actuarial facts&#8221; regarding Black/white sexual pairings  &mdash;  e.g., incidence of beatings, divorce/abandonment, etc.  By any perspective worthy of humans, sexuality is not merely a physical act with immediate emotional radiances, but it is inextricably centered within a social web that involves occupational performance, social reputation, marital  harmony, physical health (cardiac, metabolic, etc ).  Take the accessible &#8220;actuarial facts&#8221; about sexuality within the American white culture today.  Those couples nowadays who impose restraints upon their sexuality that make them less different from the common white sexual mores of, say, 1928,  have dramatically lower incidences of impairments in occupational success, social reputation standing, overall marital happiness, physical well being, etc. etc.   There appears to be some dramatic correlation between &#8220;driving with the brakes on&#8221; and  &#8220;keeping out of the ditches&#8221;  &mdash;  or, in other words, anchoring sex behind the forehead rather than between the ears.  Even if arising now in lefty hedonistic hands (and from, of all places, San Francisco)  the emphasis upon meditative sex, slow sex, and attenuated female orgasm, etc. demonstrates how White sex might become nowadays far far less primate and much much more human.     </p>

		<p>&#8220;What about situations in which there is no miscegenation but an all white extended family has liberal members who adopt all black children and infants?&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, it&rsquo;s not just liberals who adopt non-White children or miscegenate. There was a recent case where ultra-conservative, Fundamentalist parents beat to death one of their adopted African children. In other cases White women have given birth to the spawn of black rapists because of their anti-abortion stand, which also has White Christians whining about Planned Parenthood committing genocide on blacks because they have clinics in black ghettos and blacks make eager use of their services. A popular Creationist tactic is to accuse Darwin and evolutionary biology of racism.</p>
<p>Racial lunacy is not restricted to liberals, though it might be more prevalent among them, it pervades all of society. &#8220;Racism&#8221; is the one universal sin that puts you beyond the pale and makes you an outcast from all civil discourse. You may attack Muslims, women, gays, atheists, religious people, liberals, conservatives in the shrillest way possible and still get lucrative book deals, your own TV show, positions in government, but suggest that all races might not be equal in every way, or that you&rsquo;d rather like your country to remain a Western, majority White country, and you will face universal condemnation. </p>

&#8220;My own observation is that black men are extremely pushy, aggressive and manipulative in chasing white women. Most white women are somewhat naive when dealing with blacks and often get roped in by the charm blitz. &#8220;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s my take on the issue.  Men have no idea of how persistent men can be when chasing a woman.  The more a woman says no,the more a man chases her.  Black men are oversexed.  It is major occupation.  So they chase and chase and never give up.  They turn on all the charm.  They will do anything and everything to get it on with a woman White or black or anything.</p>
<p>Black men are a lot like married men.  They just keep persisting no matter how many times a woman says no.</p>
<p>Thre is a vulgar joke we have all heard.  A man brags that he just asks for sex. He gets turned down a lot, but he also gets what he wants a lot.  Remember the old sales training?  The more calls you make the more sales you&rsquo;ll make.</p>
<p>That is how black men operate.  They are always looking for sex so they get it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll try to address some issues mentioned in comments:</p>
<p># the marriage rate for Blacks is low. Therefore, 14% of their marriage to White females is, statistically, not a big deal- it&rsquo;s 0.07% of White females&rsquo; marriages. Moreover- the figure is disputable: this study claims that 14% of Black men married White women in 2008. For 2009.- <a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/pub/blog/?p=673" rel="nofollow">https://www.socialexplorer.com/pub/blog/?p=673</a> - data for Black men are combination for Blacks and Black Hispanics, respectively 7.6% and 8.6% (it cannot be simply added due to different sample sizes). Anyway, we can safely assume that things haven&rsquo;t much changed in a year. So, 14% (or even 15%) of Black males&rsquo; marriages translate to 0.07%, less than 0.1% of White female marriages that year.</p>
<p># Macho myths: although any mentally sane person knows that masculinity is not the same as physicality (Aristotle was not less of a man than his pupil, Alexander the Great), even in this field Blacks have not much to offer. For instance, if there is a field one&rsquo;s physicality &amp; &#8220;male&#8221; virtues (virtue is from &#8220;vir&#8221;, male) is tested, it&rsquo;s military. Especially various demanding special units. https://bit.ly/luY8TY </p>
<p>    Blacks, Latinos, Asians, American Indians and other minorities now make up 34 percent of the military, greater than the 28.5 percent minority representation within the general U.S. population.<br>
    But the picture is very different in elite units.<br>
The Army Special Forces, known by distinctive green berets, has 234 African-American officers and soldiers in a force of 5,200 men. Blacks make up 4.5 percent of the Green Berets, compared with nearly 24 percent of the male soldiers in the Army.</p>
<p>The Navy has only 31 blacks among its 2,299 Sea-Air-Land, or SEAL, commandos, less than 2 percent of the force. African-Americans constitute nearly 17 percent of the male personnel within the Navy.</p>
<p>And, the Air Force&rsquo; s special-tactics groups have only eight blacks in a force of 472 men, less than 2 percent. Servicewide, about 14 percent of the Air Force&rsquo; s male personnel are African-American.</p>
<p># and there is one persistent myth, about imagined Blacks&rsquo; sexual prowess &amp; &#8220;endowment&#8221;.<br>
Both are myths- the vast majority of (irresponsible) womanizers have been Whites (in recent history, FI, <a href="https://bit.ly/q0HL06" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/q0HL06</a> ). I *know* it&rsquo;s idiotic, but for the sake of truth.<br>
As for &#8220;endowment&#8221;: https://bit.ly/30JU7k </p>
<p>So- why this insistence on IQ etc. ? Of course that White race has made the modern world- from Plato and Caesar to Descartes and Cortes and Newton and Tolstoy and Heisenberg. But, it seems that another fact has to be constantly repeated: Whites are also physically superior, whether in sex or aggression.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse low-life thug lumpenproletariat with &#8220;raw masculinity&#8221;. Essentially, they&rsquo;re cowards: <a href="https://bit.ly/n6vcxa" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/n6vcxa</a></p>
<p>I mean- enough with this self-destructive negativity.  </p>

<p>So where else would the White females look when in need of fulfilling their biological imperatives?  The problems you outline in the White male population are miniscule compared to the problems in the Black and Latino male populations.  So 16% of White males are using antidepressants?  How do White males compare to Black and Latino males concerning employment, income, drug/alcohol abuse, criminal history, college education, children out of wedlock, ect?</p>
<p>If a White female can&rsquo;t find a suitable White male the problem is far more likely to reside within her.  And I&rsquo;m not implying that finding the right partner should come automatically for all people  &mdash;  it can be extremely difficult  &mdash;  but White males still comprise by far the largest available pool of eligible mates out of any group.  The media is notorious for portraying White males as weak, neurotic, cynical, and self-consumed; while minority men are typically portrayed as masculine, mature, confident, and independent.  Such a portrayal is vastly at odds with reality.    </p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a lot or rationalizing being done here to make white women seem less responsible; but what it comes down to is that it takes two to tango. The women have made themselves available to black men or they have let it be known they are open to the idea. I doubt black men have to do much persuading.</p>

		<p>The reasons why white men marry Asian women are several: They like petite women and Asian women are more likely to be petite than white women are. Asian women are seen as exotic looking more so than white women are. In some cases, especially concerning mail order brides from Asian countries, the reason for marrying these women is they appear to be more submissive and family oriented than the career oriented white woman. Women from the former Soviet Union are prized for the same reasons by some white men.</p>

<p>Yeah, the 0.07% figure sounds about right.  People like to harp on the &#8220;14%&#8221; number, but the reality is that there simply aren&rsquo;t nearly as many black men as there are white women in the country to make that as big a number as people like to pretend it is.  We&rsquo;re (at least) 60% of the population.  Assuming a 50-50 gender split that leaves white females at 30% of the total American population.  Blacks are ~13%, which would most likely put the males at the lower end of 6%(they kill each other at an alarming rate).</p>

<p>Unfortunately White women have double the rate of men of depression and the taking of anti-depressants. While they (mostly) do not look at online porn they have very unrealistic fantasies. Studies have shown that because we are all exposed these days to the absolutely best looking people through TV and movies that both men and women are much pickier than in the past. Remember men will settle for a good looking women, period. Many women these days want looks, a rich guy, etc..</p>
<p>Just ask today&rsquo;s White males in their twenties about many White women. So I do not think the reason you cited is valid. My experience is that most Black/White couples are either the White girl is overweight, or so deracinated that they are doing us WN a favor. For Black men, of course, any White woman is a prize.</p>

		<p>If it is true about Sarah Palin, then I have lost ALL respect for her. And apparently the mentioned black bb player says it did happen. The above article says that there has been a decline in marriages between Whites and hispanics, and Whites and asians because of the massive influx of hispanics and asians into the U.S. But the author failed to mention that there has also been a huge influx of africans coming to this country, especially from the Sudan and Somalia, also Kenya and the Congo. Also single black women far outnumber black men. So the author really can&rsquo;t explain the rise in black/white marriages, or refuses to admit that black men see white women as a social status symbol, like an expensive car, they can&rsquo;t stand the sight of their own kind{in other words white women are more attractive then black women} and it is their way of getting back at &#8220;whitey&#8221;. A side note, Barbara Walters admitted having a sexual fling with a black man {no surprise there} as did the late Jessica Savitch, who had an affair with the late Ed Bradley of 60 minutes. </p>

<p>If any White man or woman in your family is stupid enough to go outside what is traditional, make it clear to them that they are forever written out of your Wills, and no longer part of your family. </p>
<p>Make it clear to them that if something bad should happen to them, due to the relationship that you warned them not to engage in, that they cannot find their way to your home, to recover. No. Go live in the ghetto, with those that you love so much. </p>

<p>Why not? It&rsquo;s not like Whites then, or now, haven&rsquo;t bought and paid for their right to it, if they so choose to do so.</p>
<p>Persoanlly, I can&rsquo;t understad why White people, put out of work by NAFTA, and other such garbage, don&rsquo;t come together to form their own Businesses, and openly compete with the Companies that put them out on the street? We have the talent and training to do it. So do it. </p>
<p>Remember, Whites only buy from Whites. </p>

		<p>Many interesting &amp; valuable observations occur in this &#8220;blog&#8221;, especially suggestions for counter-action.  Let discussion continue, here if nowhere else.<br>
Sir Peter Medawar as recently as 1990 thought assortative mating in the USA would keep blacks and whites genetically separate, but political &amp; socio-cultural interventions have qualified this expectation.  He also thought we already knew enough to say that human hybridization need not lead to improvement because we cannot be sure that ultimately hybridization would ensure a &#8220;more versatile genetic structure&#8221; and that &#8220;both races will probably have adopted the well balanced genetic constitutions&#8221; matching their original environments.  Like other scientists [except possibly regarding the first generation from wide outcrossing] he questioned &#8220;hybrid vigour&#8221; in human experience. Prof. Carleton Coon once said racial intermixture can &#8220;upset the genetic as well as social equilibrium of a group&#8221; but &#8220;newly introduced genes tend to disappear&#8221; unless they provide &#8220;a selective advantage over their local counterparts&#8221;.  This must be considered in relation to the social (rather than extreme climatic)environments, if mixing is culturally promoted and medically sustained.  Wide crossing initially produces a hodge-podge effect because of resegregation of genes, but over a long period continual panmixis can result in a more stabilised breed. The integration of two populations with significantly different intellectual capacity would reduce the proportions of both geniuses and morons (statistics from Kenneth Dyer and Julian Huxley, but the former loss is more important to a society that requires increasing technological competence. In mating, two people bring with them some of their ancestral heritage, so that color-blind non-discrimination affecting individuals at school or work is not equally applicable to marriage qualification.<br>
(Eugenic problems also arise in specific cases e.g. Rhesus disease with some European-Chinese crossing.)<br>
Ethnocentrism in one form or another has been a virtually constant feature of all societies not totally degenerated. &#8220;The belief that marriage with outsiders produces offspring of less quality appears firmly entrenched in [classical] Greece as well as Rome&#8221; (Prof. Benjamin Isaac, 2006). The now dispersed Zoroastrian/Parsee community maintained endogamy for centuries without serious disadvantage, and only now has controversy over conversion(never mind mixed marriage) exploded because of numbers. The situation of Jews is too complex to discuss here, except to note that some rabbis describe the loss through accelerated marrying out as genocidal in impact, &#8220;finishing the job Hitler started&#8221;, &c.; White Gentiles might feel the same. Christian Identity ideology - whether British Israelite, or all-&#8220;Aryan&#8221; - is historically fallacious, notwithstanding the view that the OT Commandments about adultery and dishonouring parents were originally prohibitions against exogamy. <br>
To be sure, continual inbreeding within relatively small populations can intensify undesirable traits, the corrective of which can be outbreeding with related types.  But wider outcrossing entails undesirable combinations, possibly straining the whole organism.  &#8220;Race mixture can in certain cases be expected to lead to the production of less harmonious and well-balanced types&#8221; (Prof. Tage Kemp, 1958).  <br>
&#8220;Is there not then a third system, one of wider outbreeding, of real crossing, such as black-by-white&hellip;? The answer is no&hellip; If you change from outbreeding [of similars] to real crossing, you are liable to run into trouble&#8221; (Prof. Cyril Darlington, 1961).<br>
As stated earlier, research has been (almost) completely frozen since the 1960s, and glib assurance of the total harmlessness of black x white crossing has no modern evidence to support it.  It is both a manifestation of and a contribution to observable decadence. <br>

<p>Like I said above, even if 10% of the stuff in that book is true, (that&rsquo;s my instinct), that should end her political career.  What makes me think that at least a percentage of it has to be true is the axiom, where there&rsquo;s smoke, there&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is that a leftist author thinks that he can destroy her by &#8220;exposing&#8221; an interracial relationship she once supposedly had.  I thought all these lefties loved miscegenation.  Though maybe he isn&rsquo;t opposed to it, maybe he believes that most Republican voters are.  It&rsquo;s like the Mark Foley thing back in 2006;  The left wing kept telling us for years not to associate homosexuality with pedophilia, that doing so is homophobic bigotry.  Yet, when the Democrats wanted to win Congressional elections, the dug up this Mark Foley (non) scandal, which they held under the vest for about a year and a half, waiting for the right timing, then insinuated that Foley was a pedophile simply because he coached young men on effective ways to play with themselves (something the left wants to teach in public schools).  In other words, they were insinuating that Foley&rsquo;s homosexuality (he was one of the scant few openly homosexual Republicans in Congress) meant that he was a pedophile.  But it was all an attempt, fairly successful in certain circles, to dislodge conservative Christian voters from the Republican Party, as one fewer vote for a Republican was in effect a half a vote for a Democrat.</p>
<p>That might be what is going on here with Sarah Palin.  Though IMHO if you want to end her political career, the better way is to do it on substance, not fifth rate gossip.  Except the left can&rsquo;t tolerate the substance which would work because the same substance would hurt both the left and the neo/lamer right.  That substance is white racialism.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll try to throw in a few (not novel) ideas, just to state things as simply as possible.</p>
<p>1. we may speak of IQ, eugenics etc., but it boils down to- in multiracial societies, races function as the true &#8220;entities&#8221;, quasi-nations. It is situation similar, in some respects, to the 19th century Central and (South)Eastern Europe where frequently in one city, not so big, one could find 4-6 nations (if you wish, ethnic groups, but they were nations in the modern sense of the word): say, Romanians, Hungarians, Slovaks, Jews, Ukrainians,..<br>
Of course, they were all Whites. But, tensions and frequent fights ended only when these various nations got their nation-states &amp; were &#8220;cleansed&#8221; or voluntarily moved to their national state (after WW1 and WW2). So, there was no peace until final separation.</p>
<p>2. in the US, despite friction between various immigrant groups, it&rsquo;s safe to say that White Europeans who embraced English as their primary language- despite differences in religion, ethnic culture etc.- constitute a nation, American nation. As for Blacks, Asians, Muslims (who may be White Caucasians)- I&rsquo;m not so sure. You see, racial consciousness is *not* just a prejudice that can be overcome &amp; left behind, a measles of a society (like, say, religious prejudice). In multiracial societies (USA, Brazil, Cuba, Australia,..) races *do* function like central foci of collective loyalty, i.e. races are quasi-nations. They create &amp; demand fierce collective passions, social cohesion, common cultural traits, ways of communication, ethical priorities, ..heck, they are true social &amp; &#8220;national&#8221; groups. And the first step toward sanity is ..</p>
<p>3. to concede racial reality &amp; interests of various racial groups. In the case of USA, this would necessarily evince the reality of White European racial group (ca.70% of the total population). And if &#8220;racial democracy&#8221; is to function, this main category&rsquo;s wishes have to be respected. And one among the central wishes is this:  https://goo.gl/vCtDj In short- we don&rsquo;t intend to become a plurality nor minority.</p>
<p>4. miscegenation is a byproduct of a permissive, pornified &amp; fragmented society. Realistically- the way back to the 1950s &amp; Christian &#8220;respectability&#8221; is impossible. No time- machine. But- to borrow the title from an influential &amp; aesthetically inferior Russian novel: &#8220;What is to be done ?&#8221; Well, two things.</p>
<p>a) stop the immigration swamping (this is a huge operation &amp; can be done only in steps)</p>
<p>b) get the control of the MSM, AND start espousing unpopular views in a relatively acceptable manner. Incessantly drum on Black-on-White crime stats, make these things visually graphic, question ecological &amp; societal repercussions of immigration swamping, ..</p>
<p>Make allies with European nations, or their mentally sane parts. Stop the pressure on Russia&rsquo;s soft belly. Make friends in White parts of Latin America (hard, but not impossible). In short, dump the liberal dogma of correctness, positive discrimination etc. Brazil has a far higher rate of miscegenation, but has managed to increase the White population percentage &amp; has, until recently, successfully held Blacks far from government (this is current Brazilian cabinet (Whites are less than 50% of the society): <a href="https://goo.gl/TQfi6" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/TQfi6</a></p>
<p>Be pragmatic like Che Guevera in his more lucid moments: <a href="https://goo.gl/8wLYe" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/8wLYe</a> </p>
<p>As Fidel&rsquo;s close friend and ally, the murderous Ernesto &ldquo;Che&rdquo; Guevara, once said, &#8220;The Negro is indolent and spends his money on frivolities, whereas the European is forward-looking, organized and intelligent&hellip; We&rsquo;re going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the Cuban revolution. By which I mean: nothing!&rdquo;           </p>

		<p>The fact is that whether we want to admit it or not, many of these White women are WILLINGLY engaging in sexual activity with Black and Hispanic men. Now, according to recent reports, mis supposedly conservative values- Sarah Palin has been involved with Black men. Will it ever end!</p>
<p>The fact is that making indefensible statements and acting in denial does us no good. White women (and White men) must become more responsible in their behavior.<br>

<p>Get real. Mr. Palin himself is not very White- and I have a rather &#8220;relaxed&#8221; standards for &#8220;Whiteness&#8221;. The first time I saw him I recognized something of an Inuit or Asiatic in him (and her daughter Bristol I thought was a kind of China-looking).</p>
<p>Mrs. Palin left the impression of a nymphomaniac. &#8220;Hot&#8221;, &#8220;sexy&#8221;,&hellip;c&rsquo;mon. Can you imagine serious female practitioners of statecraft like Indira Ghandi, Golda Meir or Margaret Thatcher to behave like her ?</p>

<p>Sorry, my bad. I stand corrected.</p>
<p>Lynn quotes Du Bois as stating that blacks outnumbered Whites in Lisbon and in the Algarve in the 14th century.  He was trying to explain low IQ measures (albeit from only two samples) and the lowest GDP/capita of Western Europe.  He doesn&rsquo;t regard the historical black population data as reliable however thinks the suprisingly low IQ measures could be explained by a 20% admixture of Blacks if that were true.  Spains IQ measures are not low but around the Europeans average of 100.</p>

		<p>This is how the reputations of white women are ruined. Some fat loser black guy says he has sex with Sarah Palin,knowing that if she sues him it will add grease to the fire. <br>
 consider the source. Try to think of  White women as individuals and then maybe you won&rsquo;t strike out so much. The other big one is spreading rumours that a woman is a lesbian if she doesn&rsquo;t show any interest in a man.</p>

		<p>I am never surprised to find that the articles with the lengthiest comment sections tend to discuss interracial marriage. It also comes as no great shock to find the standard fare of condescension, hostility, impotence, jealousy, anger, ignorance, and defiance reflected in the comments. No wonder White men and women are more and more likely to have toxic relationships and marriages than ever before. </p>
<p>As a race realist and a White woman I would rather remain single and childless than contemplate having even the most superficial social association with a person who perceived me as walking through life forever in danger of falling to the &#8220;charms of the blacksnake&#8221;. Please give White women some credit. There are many of us who are quite capable of discerning the true intent behind the near constant bombardment of messages from many sources that glamorize sexual interaction with members of a different race. The White women I associate with have White husbands and boyfriends. Those who aren&rsquo;t currently married are interested in relationships with White men. What we&rsquo;re not interested in are overweight, unkempt, effeminate or hyper-masculine sports obsessed, pornography obsessed, rude, presumptuous men who believe themselves to be God&rsquo;s gift to humanity. Which one of these characteristics is supposed to inspire respectable White women to engage in a relationship, much less a marriage with this type of man? I would much rather defy tradition (remaining single, not marrying outside my race) than settle for a man who thinks so little of me. For a young girl who may not be ready to articulate these experiences and attitudes it would be fairly easy to take up with a non-White man who went through the motions of respecting her. Hold someone to a low standard and expect them to exceed those expectations every time. </p>

		<p>At the (growing) base of the SES pyramid, it is a raw fact of life that a marginal white  can &#8220;work the system&#8221; better by having a Black spouse who can yell or merely threaten to yell  &#8220;racism! racism!&#8221; at the Welfare office, the school free lunch application room, the hospital emergency room, etc. etc.  I&rsquo;ve seldom seen<br>
anyone in public schools censured in any way for quietly breaking rules in order to keep racial incidents or racial issues from arising.  It is assumed in silence that administrators really wish staff to do &#8220;whatever is necessary&#8221; in order to prevent or dissipate any racial ripples in the bureaucratic waters.  </p>

<p>In hindsight, I think none of this is true.  If Sarah Palin had been sexually engaged with a sports celebrity as well known as Glen Rice, it would have been researched LONG before now by a very hostile mainstream media.  Her life has been under a microscope for three years now, and I find it ludicrous that such a nugget of information would not have been ferreted out and used against her long ago.  Unless Palin or Rice come right out and admit it, I&rsquo;ll have to assume that this is yet more leftist nonsense designed to alienate her from race realists and other white conservatives. So far, all I&rsquo;ve seen is innuendo and third party statements from people who hate her.  If I were to run for president with the antics I pulled in my twenties, I would be thoroughly trashed by the leftist media. </p>

		<p><b>Really, it&rsquo;s not just liberals who adopt non-White children or miscegenate. There was a recent case where ultra-conservative, Fundamentalist parents beat to death one of their adopted African children. In other cases White women have given birth to the spawn of black rapists because of their anti-abortion stand, which also has White Christians whining about Planned Parenthood committing genocide on blacks because they have clinics in black ghettos and blacks make eager use of their services.

<p>Neocons are what you&rsquo;re talking about.  Older conservatives, like from the WWII or pre-baby boomer generation, don&rsquo;t buy into the white guilt stuff nearly as much as the baby boomer and generation x conservatives and such do.  When they bring up &#8220;abortion is black genocide&#8221; ask them, &#8220;Why is it ok to say &#8216;abortion is black genocide&rsquo; when I&rsquo;d be called a racist for pointing out it cuts down on whites?  Why is it racist of me to say massive immigration to the West hurts whites and reduces our numbers and talk about black on white crime, yet even us conservatives are free to talk about the &#8216;evils of black abortion&rsquo; or talk about Jim Crow?  Why do we keep pandering to people who will never vote for us?  Why do we preach personal responsibility, but we coddle blacks and others?

		<p>No surprise here, but I see Glen Rice is married to a white woman. And Shaq O. is having an affair with a white women from I BELIEVE Sweden. Their e-mails have been printed for everyone to read. Very sexual in nature, and repulsive. Both these women are attractive, but they chose to become involved with black men who certainly don&rsquo;t fit the definition of hansome. I for one will not watch pro sports for the simple reason that I am not interested in watching a bunch of black thugs get paid millions for acting like thugs. I will not watch college football or basketball unless there are alot of whites on the starting lineup. Ever wonder why blacks don&rsquo;t go to hockey games?</p>
