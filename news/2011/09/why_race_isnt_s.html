			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ted Thornhill, Daily Mail (London), September 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Clothing, it seems, can make us colour blind, because whether we perceive someone as &#8216;white&rsquo; or &#8216;black&rsquo; depends not just on skin tone  &mdash;  but also how smartly they are dressed, according to researchers.</p>
<p>Volunteers in a U.S. study tended to label someone as white if they were dressed in a suit  &mdash;  even if the face had dark skin  &mdash;  and labelled someone black if they were dressed in working overalls.</p>
<p>The scientists revealed that perception of race is shaped by prejudices that we already hold  &mdash;  and that racism runs deeper than we think.</p>
<p>In the study, conducted by a team of researchers from Tufts University, Stanford University and the University of California, participants, of various races, were shown a series of computerised faces, with different skin colours and clothing.</p>
<p>This was recorded by a hand-tracking technique that followed the trajectory of the mouse.</p>
<p>The study revealed how racism can be subconscious, because it comes from preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>This was reinforced by the fact that the more racially ambiguous the face was, the more the volunteers relied on the clothing to reach an answer.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s lead author, Jonathan B Freeman, from Tufts Graduate School of Arts and Sciences said: &#8216;The study shows how the perception of a face is always a compromise between the visual cues before our eyes and the baggage we bring to the table, like the stereotypes we hold.</p>
<p>&#8216;Racial stereotypes are powerful enough to trickle down to affect even basic visual processing of other people, systematically skewing the way we view our social world.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>So these researchers from Tufts University, Stanford University and the University of California, aren&rsquo;t aware that Asians are capable of wearing suits like THEIR white man?  Jeezus H!  Dirty minds dirty academics.</p>

<p>Blacks have not worn overalls for decades.  This study has got to be bogus.  They probably blacked out all the faces.</p>

		<p>They are confusing &#8220;whiteness&#8221; with simple respectability. </p>
<p>It is simply a truism that white people would be associated with the dress of our culture. If I were to dress as a Bedouin or a Mandarin, people might on first check assume I was a nomadic Arab or a Manchu noble, respectively. </p>
<p>By the same token, if I donned on a du-rag, sagged some baggy jeans, and threw on a Bape hoodie, people might say I was &#8220;black&#8221; out of simple resentment.  </p>

		<p>Generally speaking, based upon my observations and experience, black folks dress in more fashionable clothes, wear them in a more stylish manner, are more concerned with dress, etc. Just dress better than the whitey period and do so all the time.</p>
<p>FUBU [for us by us] too is a clear and obvious intent to appeal to the fashion trends and style of the Bantu. They like threads and like to wear them. Hats and shoes from top to bottom.</p>

		<p>The delu-world of TV very much infuses this.  The total varied <br>
representation of Blacks on TV has rather thin overlap with what is<br>
actually seen, say, in Wally World. Without the plethora of White<br>
Black people on TV, it would be breaking dawn in DreamLand.   </p>

There&rsquo;s an old White saying, &#8220;the clothes make the man&#8221;.</p>
<p>If you dress like a stereotype, people will see you as a stereotype.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;This was reinforced by the fact that the more racially ambiguous the face was, the more the volunteers relied on the clothing to reach an answer.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Clearly &#8220;White dress&#8221; is seen as a sign of seriousness, upper-level professionalism, and self-respect. </p>

		<p>The old saying &#8220;You can put a baboon in a suit, but he still remains a baboon&#8221; applies here. In mandela&rsquo;s new third world south africa the blacks like to dress up and drive in their wabenzi&rsquo;s, but have a look at their dwelling situation. They either live in small apartments, usually in numbers, or they buy a fancy house,  sleep on the floor with a tv and no curtains. </p>

		<p>In Las Vegas, the pimps and VIP hosts of the black persuasion, well, they dress really nice, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop them from sponging off white women until the inevitable break up which results in them beating up females. </p>

		<p>The old IQ matter  &mdash;  the &#8220;g&#8221; factor  &mdash;  again.  IQ is pretty basic<br>
to knowing how to dress for THIS or THAT setting and how to<br>
&#8220;navigate&#8221; the social observations, judgments, affinities.  Blacks that can, are less different from us than are Blacks who can&rsquo;t (and who seem a bit too close to the forest ) </p>

		<p>I will admit, I am quick to make judgement on how someone is dressed. I would probably be more inclined to be receptive to a Black person with the dress and demeanor of Colin Powell or Condoleeza Rice as opposed to a White person who dressed and resembled Kid Rock, Roseanne Barr or Dog The Bounty Hunter.</p>
<p>Appearances can mean a lot.</p>

		<p>Some news.. Study shows that people view race as more than just skin color and so look for racial indentification in dress as well.  Surprise, surprise. </p>
