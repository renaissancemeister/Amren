<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>New Jersey courts have made great strides in eliminating racial bias in recent years, but more guidance is still needed to help minorities navigate the complex legal system, a report to the judiciary says.</p>
<p>However, it also says reducing the length of time minority youths remain in detention while awaiting their day in court is still a struggle in a legal system that now has all white faces at the top rung of the ladder  &mdash;  the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>There are more black and Hispanic judges on the bench compared with 20 years ago, though the numbers have slipped in recent years. Of the 418 judges on the Supreme, Superior and Tax courts as of Nov. 10, 2010, 14 percent were minorities.</p>
<p>These were some of the findings in a study conducted every two years by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s Committee on Minority Concerns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report noted minority youths were detained nearly twice as long as whites before their cases were heard, according to information compiled for 2008, the latest year it was available. For minorities, the average stay was 33.5 days, compared with 18.2 days for white suspects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Susan Maven, chairwoman of the committee, said in the report that the courts needed to focus their efforts on the entire juvenile justice system, in which minorities account for a disproportionate number of people behind bars and not taking part in alternative programs.</p>
<p>Black youths who account for 16.1 percent of the juvenile population composed 63.6 percent of those being detained.</p>
<p>The report says judges should seek alternatives to detention for juveniles. Fisher said she suspected the youths often found themselves entangled in the legal system because of a lack of money, education and access to attorneys.</p>

		<p>In my county, blacks are only 9 percent but they are 94 percent of those detained in Juvenile prisons.  The only Whites are runaways from other cities who are there a couple days until their parents send a plane ticket.</p>

<p>Alternate explanation:  The &#8220;youths&#8221; committed a violent crime, and were duly arrested and booked into juvenile hall.</p>
<p>How many &#8220;juveniles&#8221; have access to money and attorneys?  How good can the education of someone presumed not yet to graduate from high school really be?</p>

		<p>&#8220;The report says judges should seek alternatives to detention for juveniles. Fisher said she suspected the youths often found themselves entangled in the legal system because of a lack of money, education and access to attorneys.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They are all entitled to attorneys.  As soon as they are processed the report goes to both the district attorney&rsquo;s and the public defender&rsquo;s offices the same day.  They have a defense attorney every step of the way.  Don&rsquo;t sneer at these attorneys. They have a lot of experience with the juvenile courts.  Well off Parents who retain a well known criminal attorney waste their money.  There are so many crucial differences in juvenile and adult law that the county attorney will do much, much better than a private attorney.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of federal funded groups mooching around the Juvenile Justice system supposedly &#8220;helping&#8221; these worthless scoundrels.  In my county, there are so many non profit helping groups they are actually fighting over the supply of criminal kids.  There are not enough kids to keep the moochers occupied.</p>
<p>The non profit do gooders have been caught many times falsifying<br>
the numbers of client to keep the funding going.  The worst of these agencies are the ones run by the black poverty pimp reverends. They always want the girls for obvious reasons. </p>
<p>One of the black non profit do gooder groups got federal and state funding to run a foster home for &#8220;at risk&#8221; girls.  They were not only pimps, but had lengthy criminal records of pimping. At least they never got their filthy hands on any White girls.  The place was exposed when a lot of the girls got pregnant.</p>
<p>The Whites in these non profits are generally young communists putting a couple years as &#8220;deputy executive director&#8221; to get proper experience for a federal job in one of the War on Whites agencies such as EEOC, civil rights division of the DOJ.</p>
<p>The claim that the black and hispanic kids have no help is a blatant falsehood.</p>

		<p>This is a real shocker!  Someone reading this might conclude that blacks and Hispanics commit a disproportionate amount of crime.  We&rsquo;re never going to have a truly equitable society until pernicious myths such as this are eradicated.</p>

<p>In other words they are saying since there are more White faces on the courts now, once they get more black and brown faces then this (&#8220;racism against these &#8220;youfs&#8221;) will all be reversed. Then they can get revenge with their own racial bias by keeping more White youth in their &#8220;system&#8221;.</p>
<p>See how blatant their own racism is?  But of course, most Whites won&rsquo;t even bother to see it. They will just bury their heads in the sand&hellip;again.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s a very GOOD argument for the hypothesis that cops pull Blacks and Hispanics over cuz of &#8216;da color of their skin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From a distance, light skinned Indians look Hispanic and dark skinned Indians look Black. Therefore, when they see us driving, they should be pulling us over and arresting us more frequently than whites cuz of &#8216;da color of our skin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The truth is that us Indians have a lower arrest rate than whites disproving &#8216;da color of our skin&rsquo; excuse.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not skin color that gets &#8216;youf&rsquo; in trouble- otherwise you&rsquo;d see us Indians being arrested at a much higher rate than whites rather than a lower rate.</p>

		<p>More evidence of the upside-down world we live in. The real story here is that Blacks commit crime at an astonishingly disproprtionate rate to their numbers in the population. The article ignores this, and claims the problem is the court system itself. In other words, it isn&rsquo;t those that misbehave(to put it mildly)that we should be concerned with, but our concern is that the &#8220;system&#8221; allagedly doesn&rsquo;t deal with these miscreants swiftly and efficiently enough. </p>
<p>This is a world gone mad&hellip;<br>

		<p>There is a simple solution to this dilema! We simply arrest fewer blacks (as in NONE) since the crime rate of Whites will never reach equality with blacks, this is CLEARLY the best solution.</p>

		<p>If the white kid was arrested for pot, but the black kid was arrested for murder or armed robbery or rape, then they should be getting more time in detention, and they would be less likely to be released under most circumstances - and thus raise the average detention time for blacks.</p>
<p>This is just obvious.</p>

<p>This is a blatant accusation of racism and favoritism.  The NJ Supreme Court should be outraged as should any reader of this story.  I will not even go into the rest of the article because it doesn&rsquo;t need addressing.  </p>
<p>What has passed for journalism for the last few decades is a joke  &mdash;  -ah, but perhaps not.  What it is, is propaganda.</p>
