<h1>Leila Lopes of Angola Is Crowned Miss Universe</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bradley Brooks, Yahoo! TV, September 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Newly crowned Miss Universe Leila Lopes wants to help her native Angola further escape a history of war and impoverishment and said she plans to focus on combating HIV around the globe.</p>
<p>Speaking in a timid voice early Tuesday shortly after taking the crown in South America&rsquo;s largest city, the 25-year-old Lopes said that &#8220;as Miss Angola I&rsquo;ve already done a lot to help my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve worked with various social causes. I work with poor kids, I work in the fight against HIV. I work to protect the elderly and I have to do everything that my country needs,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think now as Miss Universe I will be able to do much more.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asked about racism in light of the fact that she&rsquo;s one of the few blacks ever crowned Miss Universe, Lopes said that &#8220;any racist needs to seek help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not normal in the 21st century to think in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip} She replaces last year&rsquo;s winner, Ximena Navarrete of Mexico.</p>

		<p>They should change her title to &#8220;Miss Parallel Universe&#8221; because I&rsquo;m sure they can&rsquo;t be thinking of this universe.</p>
<p>Honestly, what did you expect? This is just PC nonsense that has nothing to do with anything - a commercial &#8220;beauty&#8221; contest to sell ads, perfume, and magazines. It&rsquo;s a one-off TV show.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain every white person on the planet, on some level, is saying, &#8220;Oh, look - they handed the award to some African to make it look good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Really, anyone who pays attention to this baloney, or takes it seriously, is deranged. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the Nobel Prize in Medicine - it&rsquo;s a business owned by Donald Trump - Mr. Class. He&rsquo;d make sure the crown went to a female raccoon if it meant an increase in revenue. </p>

		<p>There are pictures of the winner posted on the net. In my honest, male opinion, I would rate her a 5 1/2 to a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. I doubt if I would get much argument from others that she is more attractive than what I stated&hellip;&hellip;If these judges are determined to foist this crown on blacks as often as possible, I&rsquo;d suggest finding a black woman who is much more attractive, and though very rare, there are a few. Otherwise this contest will continue to come off as biased or even fixed. Personally I lost all interest in these beauty pagents in the early 80&rsquo;s when vanessa williams was crowned over obviously much more attractive White contestants. </p>

		<p>Good grief.</p>
<p>This one acually looks somewhat darker skinned, which is a shock in itself.  Usually, these so called &#8220;black&#8221; contestants appear to be a chromosome away from being white.</p>
<p>There will never be an &#8220;integrated&#8221; beauty pageant with pure blooded african women standing among white women&hellip;it will never happen.  These pageant girls will always be significantly comprised with the genetic makeup of the hated white race.  Blacks don&rsquo;t seem to grasp how ridiculous this is.  </p>
<p>If &#8220;black is so beautiful&#8221; and blacks are so proud of their own heritage, culture and especially race, why are blacks so pathetically willing to &#8220;claim&#8221; these girls as one of their own? </p>

		<p>Beauty contests are so subjective.  I mean, all of the girls look unbelievably cookie-cutter beautiful.  The winners are chosen for political reasons, much like the Nobel Peace Prize.  Last year it was Mexico (to give that failed narco-cess pool something)and this year its Angola (affirmative action &#8220;see black women are beautiful, too.) </p>

		<p>I doubt there will ever be another Northern European that wins this contest.  The white hating multicultists won&rsquo;t allow it.  Notice how the media can&rsquo;t restrain themselves from espousing their belief that since black women don&rsquo;t dominate the Miss Universe voting then it must be racist.  Laughable.  </p>

		<p>All kidding aside, we can wish Leila Lopes [note the Portuguese &#8216;Lopes&rsquo;here, not the Spanish &#8216;Lopez&rsquo;] all the best.</p>
<p>Sadly, well-meaning starlets, peripatetic princesses and grinning-for-the-camera beauties don&rsquo;t actually seem to make the world a noticeably better place.</p>
<p>The Angolan Civil War pitted a soi-disant-Marxist leadership, many of whom were urbanites of mixed race and almost all of whom were nominally Catholic, against Western-backed pure-blood rural Afrficans, many of whom were Protestants of one kind or another - with most of the rest tribal animist - and eventually a sort-of peace was patched up.</p>
<p>In all fairness, Angola is recovering well now that the Cold War is over. </p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t some Boers from South Africa taking up farming there or am I thinking only of Mozambique?</p>

<p>Note to Miss Lopes: we whites have solved our HIV problem. Simple technology (condoms) and basic education (no glove, no love) sufficed for us. What&rsquo;s keeping you? </p>

		<p>If you think this is vacuous and shallow, politicians aren&rsquo;t much better.  Every September and October of even numbered years, our media outlets are full of political ads from candidates who tout their support for education and health care.  In doing so, they go out on a limb, supporting a radical extreme fringe position; only 99.9999% of voters support education and health care.</p>
<p>Miss Lopes is said to &#8220;work with poor kids.&#8221;  Translation:  She once saw some poor kids.  She wants to &#8220;combat HIV around the globe.&#8221;  Translation:  She&rsquo;ll appear in HIV prevention PSAs in about 50 countries, voice dubbed in all languages but her own.</p>

<p>And by the way, there are alot of things in the 21st century that should not be, but are. Like Affirmative action, Black idol worship, and racism towards white people in their own country. </p>

		<p>Well, &#8220;racism&#8221; obviously didn&rsquo;t stop her from winning.  So she can&rsquo;t really say it exists (or if it does it she shouldn&rsquo;t care since it doesn&rsquo;t effect her at all).  At any rate, I&rsquo;m sure her next social cause will be defending the rights of and raising awareness for S. African white farmers being slaughtered for having the audacity to help feed the continent.  I won&rsquo;t hold my breath.  </p>

		<p>This woman&rsquo;s physique does not correspond to our (Whites&rsquo;) aesthetic standards of female beauty. Sorry, I think races should have separate beauty contests (although the very pageant is ridiculous &amp; voyeuristic).<br>
Perhaps:<br>
East Asians<br>
Whites<br>
Blacks<br>
Non-White Caucasoids (Indians, Pakistanis)<br>
&hellip;.</p>
<p>Apples and oranges, that&rsquo;s it. No universal &#8220;measure&#8221; for beauty. Chinese landscape painting cannot be compared to Corot or Constable, and vice versa. </p>

		<p>Our liberal elites have been trying to impose a new dark standard of beauty on us for some time, with only partial success. The esthetic prop of the fair skinned women with classic Nordic features is still the preferred look in most Western/European countries. Despite the constant promotion of dark skinned, full lipped, and hipped models as weather girls, co-news anchors, and now action oriented actresses, the public, at any rate, remains stuck in traditional American/Western standards of beauty.</p>

		<p>The fix was in.  I saw the event on TV.  The first runner-up, from Ukraine, was positively gorgeous.  It is she, not Miss Angola, who should be wearing the crown.  </p>
<p>By the way, why does every beauty contest finalist nowadays have to show her human being bonafides by vowing to fight AIDS or  help autistic kids?  Does anytone think this gesture amounts to anything more than ring-finger-kissing symbolism?  The Sandra Bullock movie of a number of years ago, &#8220;Miss Congeniality,&#8221; spoofed that ritual.    </p>

		<p>I agree, I would much rather Ms. Ukraine been the winner. Mrs. Lopes is in no way a true African, she&rsquo;s racially mixed. While a good looking for a black lady, I still think the runner up was by far the one who should have won because. Indeed all of the contestants from Slavic nations were gorgeous. That said, I never cared for beauty paegents, I feel they are becomming harmful to our race and white women and girls especially. Especially those where they compete with women of other races in this hostile, anti-white reality today. If anything, I&rsquo;m in favor of paegants where the contestants are all of the same race.</p>

		<p>My guess is that probably none of these women are really as beautiful as they appear to be. Take away the million dollar make-up as well as all the other accessories, and you would see a lot of plain janes.

		<p>Beauty is not subjective.  Taste is subjective.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum" rel="nofollow">De gustibus non est disputantum</a>.  <br>
<p><br>
White skin is more beautiful than non-White skin; same for White features, hair, eyes and everything else White.<br>
<p><br>
You really do not find successful White men married to Black women.  A woman&rsquo;s attractiveness is associated with her ability to produce attractive, healthy, and intelligent children.  This is an unconscious goal in men&rsquo;s mating strategy.<br>
<p><br>
Almost all Black men prefer White women.  Many successful Black men obtain one.  If Black women were truly attractive, that is if they truly could give birth to good children, White men would have scoop them up long ago and we would have no race problem.<br>
<p><br>
Certainly some Black women are more or less attractive than other Black women, but when you are at the Beauty Contest level there could never be a Black woman to come within the reach of the first million White women and that Black woman would be over 50% White.  <br>
<p><br>
I have known hundreds of Black women.  I have gone to school with them, worked with them, and lived near them.  There are some very nice Black women, but I would never go out with any one of them.<br>
<p><br>
Those are the hard facts. In attractiveness Black women lag behind White women more than their mere one standard deviation that they lag in intelligence.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a beauty pageant, who cares who won the meaningless prize? Will anyone remember who won next year? I&rsquo;m more disturbed by the blatant nordicism of many posters here. </p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, with the exception of Miss Australia, most of the other contestants look Hispanic or mixed in one way or another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are you saying Miss Ukraine isn&rsquo;t White? Brunettes can&rsquo;t be White?</p>
<p>This is an ideology that would relegate vast numbers of native Europeans, even in northern countries to non-White status. <br>

		<p>Actually she&rsquo;s decent in appearance, and has the look of someone who could get decent grades in a social sciences curriculum. Apparently she has been a business student. Probably, she is Afro-Portuguese in descent.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m thinking back to the Vanessa Williams affair. Runner up that year was Suzette Charles of New Jersey. Charles was black woman of the same type as Bess Myerson and Phyllis George, able to speak articulately and hold her own among the high and mighty. She was Miss America for about seven weeks after William jumped ship.</p>
<p>The pageant obviously was intent on picking a black woman as Miss America. If they had picked Charles in the first place they would have saved themselves a lot of trouble. BTW, Suzette Charles was half Italian (father) and half Black (mother).</p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s by far not as unattractive or average as many other black contestants have been, but no one who&rsquo;s being honest could tell you that she deserved to win with a straight face.</p>
<p>I only have to wonder why whites still even bother to compete. How many times do they have to see drop-dead gorgeous whites lose to ugly blacks in these contests before they realize what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

		<p>I thought she was beautiful and genuine and was a good choice as winner.  Of course, I would have been glad to escort most any of those women anyway.  </p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t understand why this is here. She has an amazing body, natural tan, and is probably a very nice person. This is Miss Universe, not Miss Europe, and everyone should be allowed to have their own personal taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is here because ANY of the other women on stage with her are more beautiful.  It is here because it is an obvious PC result.  It is here because aside from her hair and skin, her features ARE European (she&rsquo;s obviously mulatto).  It is here because such contests and politics ultimately affect what the majority of shallow people LIKE YOU take for beauty, as these perceptions can be modified by politics and the sorts of nonsense that causes you to seen genetic outcomes like her dark skin as a &#8220;tan.&#8221;  It is here because even though she is being touted as the most beautiful in the &#8220;universe,&#8221; most of her West African male compatriots would ditch her in an ally to go after a white woman, and especially any of the other contestants on the state with her.  It is here because of the blatant hypocrisy of all the overt anti-white racism involved in the contest. </p>
<p>One final question for you; What&rsquo;s your IQ?</p>

		<p>There are pageants for separate races. For example, Miss Asian America, Miss Black USA, Miss Black America, Miss Latina America. Miss Chinatown USA, Nisei Week Queen (contestants have to be at least 50 percent Japanese).</p>

		<p>After Carrie Prejean and Morgan Woolard were ambushed by questions and did well on their answers, it is clear that there is an active campaign against white women by the pageant in the USA. </p>
<p>For this reason, I don&rsquo;t take hispanic and black winners seriously, since they don&rsquo;t face the same adversity. </p>
