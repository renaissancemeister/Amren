It was their intention to prevent our ideas from being heard, and to keep in place an iron curtain sealing off any discussion of racial differences. Their campaign failed and, I would note, their failures have not been limited merely to one momentary failure here in Louisville. Their failures have been consistent.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">When the theory of racial egalitarianism had not yet been put into practice, it did not have the disadvantage of a track record that could be examined to test the validity of their hypotheses. Thoughtful people   &mdash;   those who opposed the integration of the school systems in the 1950s and other subsequent proposals to force racial mixing   &mdash;   predicted correctly that these policies would fail. However, they had no examples to point to as proof of the inevitable failure of racial egalitarianism.</p><table class="quoteright" style="background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-left: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: right; width: 422px; "><tbody><tr><th>The egalitarian product has been constantly renamed, as the public comes to associate the name with its failed results.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The advocates of integration had the advantage of a theory that appealed to human emotion and that promised to accomplish great things. We were told when the liberal program was in its infancy and was then called &#8220;desegregation,&#8221; that if the races were mixed and white control of our society removed, poverty would be abolished. Blacks would rise to the academic levels of whites. Crime rates would drop. Schools would improve. As blacks were elevated academically, welfare would decline. Since the theory had not been put to the test, such prospects were very alluring.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Despite the warnings of such men as Lothrop Stoddard, Madison Grant and Carlton Putnam, the racial liberals had their way. They triumphed   &mdash;   temporarily, of course   &mdash;   but they triumphed. The policies they advocated have been implemented all across America, and indeed throughout the entire European world. In every case they have failed. Who can name an integrated community that has succeeded? Where has integration led to greater prosperity, higher academic standards, reduced welfare and less crime? &#8220;Success&#8221; exists only in the imaginations of liberals, who are always willing to try their failed experiments yet again.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">It is perhaps significant that the liberals themselves speak of their policies as &#8220;experiments,&#8221; yet they are unable to draw any lessons from the results. As each liberal program fails for the umpteenth time, the liberal diverts his gaze and focuses on the horizon where he sees his utopia hovering somewhere out there; where everyone of every race and hue will be exchanging comments in their bathrooms   &mdash;   as they do on television   &mdash;   over the wonders of respective brands of toothpaste or shampoo.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The fact that the liberal racial program has failed consistently for 40 years does not phase or deter the liberal. He remains convinced that he is only one more civil rights law, only one more government program, only one more Supreme Court decision away from reaching his dream. The liberal reasons: &#8220;It didn&rsquo;t work in Miami, but we are going to make it work in Jacksonville. Maybe it didn&rsquo;t work in Atlanta, but we are going to make it work in Louisville.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The only concession the liberal seems to make to the reality of his program&rsquo;s terrible record is that he cleverly gives the same policy different names. We note that the egalitarian product has been constantly repackaged, as the public comes to associate the name with its failed results. Thus does the name keep changing, from &#8220;desegregation&#8221; to &#8220;integration&#8221; to &#8220;multi-culturalism&#8221; to &#8220;diversity.&#8221;</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1997/05/drunk.gif" height="175" width="200" align="right" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">What is truly appalling is how slow this country is to catch on to the failure of the experiment. It took the United States only about a decade to recognize that Prohibition was unworkable. Prohibition was correctly described by Herbert Hoover as &#8220;the noble experiment,&#8221; but it failed. The country soon realized that the costs of Prohibition outweighed the benefits. And unlike desegregation/ integration/multi-culturalism/diversity, Prohibition could show some successes. Alcoholism and its attendant tragedies declined. Nevertheless, Americans by and large, after only one decade, recognized that the cost to society in the form of organized crime outweighed this benefit, and that Prohibition should be abandoned.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Today, Americans seem to be slow learners.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">When the grip of the Communists began to slip in the Soviet Union a few years ago, opponents of that cruel system, who had previously been silenced by the secret police finally were able to demonstrate openly their disdain for the failed Marxist state. In the first anti-Communist demonstration in Red Square in Moscow, Russians marched with placards bearing a wise and clever slogan: &#8220;70 years on the road to Nowhere!&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">I could not help but notice the absence of any similar slogan or demonstration here in the United States two years ago on the 40th anniversary of&nbsp;<i>Brown v. Board of Education.</i>&nbsp;Where were the demonstrators bearing signs reading, &#8220;40 years on the road to Nowhere!&#8221;?</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">One also wonders how it is that our people ever succumbed to the nonsense of racial equality. People have known the truth about race for centuries. They did not need the research of Arthur Jensen or Philippe Rushton. The truth about race was obvious to virtually all people until very recent times. Now is it not odd that the burden of proof has been shifted to us to prove a negative   &mdash;   that the races are not equal?</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Two clear examples come to mind immediately to show how preposterous is the liberal position. The first is the evolution argument. Most liberals believe in evolution, as do I. Yet the position of a liberal who believes in evolution can be summed up as follows:</p><blockquote style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;After a period of hundreds of thousands of years, evolving under different climatic conditions, encountering different challenges such as the Ice Ages, suffering different epidemics, subjected to different catastrophes and good fortune, all races magically ended up equal.&#8221;</blockquote><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">It would appear unlikely and hard to believe that after such an enormous length of time and under such different circumstances every group would end up at the same point, but this is the theory the liberal has to sell to intelligent people. Astonishingly, they seem to buy it.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The other example of a liberal position that seems impossible to defend is the view that the human brain is the sole exception to the laws of heredity. It is now indisputable that heredity governs many facets of human life. It is admitted even by the liberal that heredity governs height, eye color, and hair color. The liberal will concede that heredity governs all forms of plant and animal life. Nor will it be disputed that it governs every organ of man   &mdash;   except for the human brain.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The egalitarian&rsquo;s position may be summarized as follows:</p><blockquote style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;All creation, including plant and animal life, is subject to the laws of heredity. Every organ of the human species is likewise governed by the laws of heredity. The human brain stands alone as the only object of creation whose functioning is unaffected by heredity and is controlled strictly by environment.&#8221;</blockquote><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Amazingly, this goofy theory prevails in our greatest universities, and its opponents have to explain scientifically why such a preposterous theory is fallacious. And those who refute the theory of racial equality have to do so at the risk not only of their financial security, but sometimes even of their physical safety.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">This situation has been brought about in part by the strategic use of guilt. The only people who outperform Christians in the business of guilt are liberals. And I will concede that when liberals decry the white race as the cancer of history, they are right about one thing: It was our race that gave the world liberalism and for that we should feel guilty.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><b>White Racial Weaknesses</b></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Our race has many fine qualities. We have given the world great things   &mdash;   a magnificent literature, incomparable music, the world&rsquo;s greatest architecture, the breakthroughs in science and medicine that have made humanity&rsquo;s lot so much better. But while we may take pride in the achievements of our race, we would be foolish not to recognize that our race also has its peculiar weaknesses.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">We are already able to warn individuals of genetic susceptibilities they may carry. We will soon be able to determine, for instance, if a child has the genes that dispose him toward alcoholism or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We would be similarly advised to look at ourselves to see if there are any peculiar weaknesses we have as a race that put our survival at risk. Specifically, we need to determine if there are any particular factors that make whites vulnerable to the preposterous but fatal theory of racial equality and even equivalence   &mdash;   the theory that whites could be displaced, without much loss, by people of any other race.</p><table class="quoteright" style="background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204); margin-left: 1em; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em; padding-left: 1em; float: right; width: 422px; "><tbody><tr><th>The more gifted and well educated a European is, the more likely he is to succumb to the egalitarian fantasy.</th></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">One notes at the outset a peculiar phenomenon   &mdash;   the more gifted and well educated a European is, the more likely he is to succumb to this fantasy. It is a commonplace observation that the average truck driver in America has a far better understanding of race than the average professor. Anyone who has talked with cab drivers in London knows that they have a much better grasp of racial problems in England than does Prince Charles with his Cambridge education.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">We can partly excuse the academic and the Prince of Wales because of their relative lack of exposure to racial realities. Certainly, Prince Charles knows little more about race than what he has been told. But how is it that the leading minds of our people have succumbed to the fallacy of egalitarianism? Observations of this kind are admittedly speculative, but I think the explanation lies in our genetic weaknesses, weaknesses that are the unfortunate &#8220;other side&#8221; of our virtues.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The excessive sense of &#8220;fair play&#8221; of which Mr. Taylor spoke in his talk can be a severe and crippling weakness in the struggle for self-preservation [see &#8220;The Ways of our People,&#8221; AR, Sept. and Oct. 1996]. Blacks are, I believe, less hampered by such feelings. For example, they vote far more intelligently than whites. Whites vote to please their college sociology professor, their newspaper editor, their priest, or their fellow yuppies. Whites therefore do not vote for what is good for themselves, their people, their progeny, or their country. Blacks are not so befuddled. They go to the polls in election after election and return an overwhelming vote for candidates and policies that favor them, their race, and their children.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Only a tiny number of whites are able to think coherently about their survival as a group. Even we in this room are often unable to think consistently; we must concede that we, too, can be victims of liberal guilt feelings foisted upon us. Recently,&nbsp;<i>American Renaissance&nbsp;</i>published an elegant essay in two parts written by Michael Masters, explaining in most convincing terms why it is moral for whites to survive, why it is moral to resist the forces that are reducing us to a racial minority here and, eventually, even in Europe.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">One would think that even an amoebae would know that survival is better than death! With our people, however, one has to argue them into surviving. This situation is comparable to being sent onto the playing field, huddling with the team, and having to explain the exciting new idea that it is better to win than to lose. It is breathtaking, absolutely breathtaking, that our race is so tripped up in abstractions about racial equality and equivalence that we can now be objective about our own survival. To have to argue the men and women of our race into survival is like going hunting and having to carry the hound.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">It could even be said that the prevalence of such fuzzy thinking about racial survival is an argument in favor of those who dispute the theory of evolution and believe in creation. The scientists among us are forced to explain how genes that permit abstract speculation about our own survival could possibly have survived the millennia. One would think that the genes of people this befuddled would be found only by scientists doing DNA research on the fossilized dung of saber tooth tigers!</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; "><b>Squanto and Ephialtes</b></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">When I was a child, my parents were not great believers in television. The first television program we were allowed to watch was the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, which we were marched up the street and ordered to sit and watch. Since I had thought from what my friends had said that TV was some sort of sinful treat, I was surprised to see what appeared to be nothing more than another boring church service, with adults walking around in robes and reading the Bible.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The lack of television meant that I did a lot of reading, much of which was from the tales of antiquity and novels by the Victorian writer, G. H. Henty. One of these stories was that of the pass at Thermopylae. Like generations of Europeans before me, I sentimentally identified with the men of Sparta who died &#8220;obedient to her laws.&#8221; One main character in that story, however, fails to stick in most people&rsquo;s memory. You will remember that a Greek shepherd showed the Persians a mountain path around the pass by which they could ambush the Greeks from the rear. That man was Ephialtes the Malian.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">As a child I read about Ephialtes and imagined that he must have been the most shocking sort of out-and-out traitor. However, in my old age, having had much experience with liberals, and especially with Christian liberals who believe that Christianity enjoins more concern for other groups than for our own, I have changed my image of Ephialtes the Malian. I no longer see him as simply a traitor, pure and simple, but as a much more complicated psychological type.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">I see him looking at the Persian &#8220;immigrants&#8221; as they come to take his people&rsquo;s homeland. I hear him saying, &#8220;Oh, look! Here come those poor Persians looking for a home. I bet they have interesting things to eat. Maybe they will open up a Persian restaurant. We&rsquo;ll have diversity. Why, look at that one there; he might want to marry my daughter. Poor things. They look hungry and thirsty. Maybe I can help them. It&rsquo;s what Zeus would have us do.&#8221;</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Likewise I thought for some time that only our race produced renegades like Ephialtes. However, I then recalled the story of little Squanto. Some of you will remember Squanto, the kindly Indian boy who showed the Pilgrims how to fertilize their corn by planting a little fish in the ground with each corn seed. Most of us were told the Squanto story in 5th or 6th grade, as the schools were already softening us up for multi-culturalism and laying the ground work for guilt feelings we were supposed to have for mistreating the noble, kindly Indians, especially when whites should have been grateful to clever Squanto for teaching them how to plant crops.</p><table class="boxleft" style="margin-right: 1em; float: left; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1997/05/indianonhorse.gif" height="370" width="197" align="left" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">In the light of later history, it certainly seems that Squanto and his female predecessor, Pocahontas, were both unlucky draws of the cards for the Indians. When one reflects that the Indians generally sired brave heroes like Geronimo and Sitting Bull, who defended   &mdash;   albeit without success   &mdash;   their people&rsquo;s patrimony, how unlucky for them that at the precise moment when they most desperately needed a Geronimo or a Sitting Bull they got a Squanto and a Pocahontas!</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Our own race has gone from a situation in which our equivalent of Squanto, Ephialtes the Malian, was the rare exception to one in which we have almost nothing but Squantos in churches, schools, colleges, newspapers and labor unions helping the alien colonizers plant the corn. I wonder if any of them ever reflect on how the descendants of Geronimo and Sitting Bull today   &mdash;   cooped up on reservations, having lost their native languages and culture   &mdash;   must gnash their teeth and curse the day when Squanto and Pocahontas were born.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">If a fate for our people different from that of the Indians is to be avoided, it will require brave and intelligent leadership. When I was a child, one of my favorite chapters of history was the story of the Spanish Armada. I read and reread the G. H. Henty novel on this episode in British history,&nbsp;<i>With Drake in the Armada</i>.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">Most of you remember the story. In the time of Queen Elizabeth, England was a poor little island on the fringe of Europe. It was one of the last citadels of freedom left, as the Spanish Empire had crushed nation after nation beneath the weight of royal absolutism and the Inquisition. Everyone knew that there would eventually be war between the colossal empire of Spain and little England. For years the government of Queen Elizabeth had scrimped and saved, pouring what little revenue was available into preparing the fleet for the inevitable war and into succoring the hard-pressed Dutch patriots. Every loyal Englishman knew how high the stakes were, because he could see across the Channel what the results of Spanish despotism were.</p><table class="boxright" style="margin-left: 1em; float: right; "><tbody><tr><td><img src="/ar/1997/05/armada.gif" height="173" width="200" align="right" alt="" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-right-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-bottom-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); border-left-color: rgb(187, 187, 187); box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; -webkit-box-shadow: rgb(136, 136, 136) 0px 0px 5px; " /></td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">At last, after years of waiting, came the long anticipated declaration of war from Spain. The greatest fleet in human history was preparing to sail. All the forces of Spain, the Inquisition, and the Counter-Reformation were descending upon England. Every Englishman knew what the fate of his country would be if that Armada were ever able to escort to an English port the Duke of Parma with his dreaded Spanish&nbsp;<i>tercios,</i>&nbsp;the unrivaled Spanish military formations that had never known defeat on land. No nation had ever stood up to the Spanish infantry. The only hope was to imitate the Dutch, who had opened the dikes, flooded their land, and defended themselves at sea. At all cost the Armada had to be stopped.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">All during the spring and summer the sentinels had stood on the rocky promontories along the southern coast of Britain, straining their eyes south for the first sight of the Spanish sails. Finally, the word came to The Lizard, the southernmost point in Britain, that the Armada had been sighted and was now bearing down on the little island. The bonfire was lighted at The Lizard and then as planned all across southern England bonfire after bonfire was lighted as signals to send word to London and the Queen that the Armada was coming.</p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">The Queen, knowing the mortal threat to England&rsquo;s very survival, made a royal inspection of her army, gathered at Tilsbury for the nation&rsquo;s defense. After riding slowly through the ranks, she made a magnificent declaration to the men, which was met with a thunderous ovation. It still speaks movingly   &mdash;   or should   &mdash;   to every Anglo-Saxon wherever he lives.</p><blockquote style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">&#8220;My loving people, I have been urged by some to take care how I expose myself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery [there had been assassination attempts]. But I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear their people. I have always so governed that, next to God, I have placed my chiefest strength and safeguard in the loyal hearts and good will of my subjects. Therefore, I come amongst you at this grave hour as you see, being resolved in the midst of the heat of battle to live or die amongst you all for my God, for my kingdom, for my people and in defense of their religion and liberty. I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm; to which, rather than any dishonour shall grow by me, I myself will take up arms.&#8221;</blockquote><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.1em; ">One can imagine the impact of this proclamation on the English.

While England was freedom&rsquo;s hope, her freedom was not all that it could have been. Catholics and the Irish did not enjoy that freedom, although in time they would come to do so.

		<p>&#8220;The fact that the liberal racial program has failed consistently for 40 years does not phase or deter the liberal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Raymond Wolters, in Race and Education, noted that as forced integration failed to improve academic achievement, those behind it changed the goal, or rationalization for it, so that improved achievement was no longer the goal of forced integration but instead it was need so students could co-mingle and work with those of other races. </p>

		<p>Only a tiny number of whites are able to think coherently about their survival as a group. Even we in this room are often unable to think consistently; we must concede that we, too, can be victims of liberal guilt feelings foisted upon us. Recently, American Renaissance published an elegant essay in two parts written by Michael Masters, explaining in most convincing terms why it is moral for whites to survive, why it is moral to resist the forces that are reducing us to a racial minority here and, eventually, even in Europe.<br>

<p>Most Whites today think it is IMMORAL for their own race to survive due to massive, unrelenting brainwashing by the enemy. They put nonwhites on a pedestal. So we have become the tail and they the head. Seems I have read about this in the Bible. But, no Christian of today can connect the dots. Thanks to people like Ralph Reed, Richard Land, TV evangelists, Billy Graham, Christian radio and the rest of their &#8220;leaders&#8221;. The White race as a whole, are the smartest people on the planet, yet the dumbest when it comes to survival and racial realities. </p>

		<p>One notes at the outset a peculiar phenomenon  &mdash;  the more gifted and well educated a European is, the more likely he is to succumb to this fantasy. It is a commonplace observation that the average truck driver in America has a far better understanding of race than the average professor. Anyone who has talked with cab drivers in London knows that they have a much better grasp of racial problems in England than does Prince Charles with his Cambridge education.<br>
 <br>
- Sam Dickson, American Renaissance, May 1997<br>
 <br>
Affluent whites have usually come in contact with few blacks during their entire lives. Those few have usually been exceptional, or they have occupied subordinate positions without resentment. Truck drivers and cab drivers have usually been victims of black crime, and/or they know others who have been too. <br>

<p>I would like to see where in the Bible, particularly in the Christian NT about &#8220;this.&#8221;  The zeal for white prominence came from pre-Christian tribal identities and the sort of rebellion against Christianity that were fought by the Church throughout its history.  Since the cultural identity of Northern Europe had been indelibly stamped with the Christian label, what resulted was the worst of both worlds via Protestantism and a guarantee of white civil war in Europe and North America.  (The problem of the French and English in Canada is based in that clash for example).  As the rule of law and social justice grew, the aggression of Christianity in Europe and elsewhere has been mollified, so that all that is left today are tax exempt businesses exploiting the public and deceiving the citizen.  But put simply, there is NO place in the NT that supports white exclusiveness or the rule of whites over any other racial or ethnic group in any manner.  The OT pertains to the Jews and is only a supplement for Christians so that they may &#8220;understand&#8221; why Jesus was the expected &#8220;Messiah.&#8221;  There is simply NO argument for white exclusiveness or the survival of specific racial or ethnic groups on earth or even in &#8220;heaven.&#8221;  Great question would be; &#8220;What does Heaven look like?&#8221;  Of course, this opens up a plethora of absurdities on that subject.</p>

		<p>Prince Charles is still affected by the gentlemanly &#8220;anti-racism&#8221; of the 1950s/1960s exemplified by Philip Mason (whose excellent academic Institute of Race Relations was eventually taken over by radical leftists like Sivanandan) and the Jungian Laurens Van Der Post, interested in Muslim philosophy, engaged in charity-work to get youth of all colours employed. Despite the fact that he cannot as Heir to the Throne make statements hostile to ethnic segments within the Kingdom and Crown Commonwealth, and is expected to treat all individuals with exemplary courtesy, he is quite sound in other promising respects, such as his active commitment English heritage. Reading between his lines, one can detect more awareness of multi-colonial problems within the Realm than may at first register.  Like others in his social sphere he is kept from direct contact with the black underclass, but his college education in anthropology did make his private office grateful for the gift of John Baker&rsquo;s classic &#8220;Race&#8221;. His beloved late grandmother, Mary the Queen Mother, and his father the Duke of Edinburgh (author of many comments on global overpopulation, communist fallacies &c;) have been palace counterweights in the right direction.  The PoW will be OK in the end if he becomes King over a Parliament that has at last decided to save England and the English from total obliteration.<br>
And the latter is the really big problem, partly because of the &#8220;moral&#8221; paralysis of white-skinned &#8220;Anglos&#8221;.<br>
Eventually blood may prove thicker than water. The prospect of avoiding bloodshed, as such, with - whites on the undeserved receiving end - may well have crossed HRH&rsquo;s intelligent mind.  The Queen has had to preside over and try to keep going a multi-coloured former Empire, but its member-states are either republics or moving that way.  The political enemies of white sovereignty are also enemies of the white sovereign; and the British monarchy (despite recommendations from the Left) is not likely to crossbreed in the near future.</p>

<p>You are completely wrong. You would not understand if I told you the truth since you only believe your own absurdities of mainstream Christianity. Start with Gen 1 and 2. But of course you will never see the TWO different creations there, will you? Do you honestly think Adam and Eve produced different races of people? If so, you are terribly mistaken. Kind after kind is God&rsquo;s own law. Did He break His own law?</p>
<p>One thing you need to check out is WHO really is the Bride of Christ. The ones He &#8220;died&#8221; for? What was the true purpose of His dying for His Bride? Who were/are those &#8220;brides&#8221;?</p>
<p>BTW, do you really believe that racial mixing is in God&rsquo;s will? That He did not set boundries (borders) for His &#8220;nations&#8221;?  What does that word nations mean to you? The world? Does it not mean HIS Tribes? </p>
<p>You are a silly pc multicult like most Christians of today are. How is that working out for you and us?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Most of you remember the story. In the time of Queen Elizabeth, England was a poor little island on the fringe of Europe. It was one of the last citadels of freedom left, as the Spanish Empire had crushed nation after nation beneath the weight of royal absolutism and the Inquisition. Everyone knew that there would eventually be war between the colossal empire of Spain and little England. For years the government of Queen Elizabeth had scrimped and saved, pouring what little revenue was available into preparing the fleet for the inevitable war and into succoring the hard-pressed Dutch patriots. Every loyal Englishman knew how high the stakes were, because he could see across the Channel what the results of Spanish despotism were.</p>
<p> <br>
At last, after years of waiting, came the long anticipated declaration of war from Spain. The greatest fleet in human history was preparing to sail. All the forces of Spain, the Inquisition, and the Counter-Reformation were descending upon England. Every Englishman knew what the fate of his country would be if that Armada were ever able to escort to an English port the Duke of Parma with his dreaded Spanish tercios, the unrivaled Spanish military formations that had never known defeat on land. No nation had ever stood up to the Spanish infantry. The only hope was to imitate the Dutch, who had opened the dikes, flooded their land, and defended themselves at sea. At all cost the Armada had to be stopped.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stopped reading right there.  This English supremacy or whatever it is has absolutely no place in White race consciousness.  </p>
<p>The real story of the Armada is that</p>
<p>First the Spanish conquered S. American, the Caribbean, and Portugual thus getting ports in Japan, Africa, India and China and the Phillipines.</p>
<p>Second the Spanish brought back billions every year to Spain and the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Third  French, English and Dutch pirates infested the sea lanes leading to Spain so as to attack and steal the Spanish treasure ships. England was the leading pirate nation in 1588.</p>
<p>Fourth  Drake and Raleigh were the leading English pirates.  The English goverment financed and benefitted greatly from English piracy practiced on Spanish ships.</p>
<p>Ever heard of Raleigh&rsquo;s attacks on Venuzuela or Portobello?  He was one of the most successful pirates and thieves in history.  He did it with the full consent of ER1</p>
<p>Get real and stop with this English heritage or whatever it is history.  Next thing you will be defending the Boer war and the commonwealth, the nastiest collection of black and brown blood soaked dictators and thieves in the world.</p>
<p>Every time I see ER2 surrounded by them I get sick.</p>
<p>For the past 800 years, England always fomented and created wars between whoever was the most powerful nation in Europe and whatever nation they could bribe or subvert into attacking the most powerful nation.</p>
<p>More than any other European nation, England and its constant continual interference with continental affairs is responsible for Europe&rsquo;s never ending wars.</p>
<p>Both Belgium and Prussia were entirely created by England.</p>
<p>I am English by the way, a direct descendant of Admiral Sir Arthur Champerowne, Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s maternal uncle.</p>
<p>I am really getting tired of what another poster called 1910<br>
middle school history books.<br>

		<p>English heritage for me is our landscape, poetry and science.<br>
English is a language that should be maintained as the primary tongue of Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the USA, and the literature that goes with it.<br>
Much could be said for and against English and Empire history, and much is still being said against it by leftists and coloured racialists. Many other nations of all kinds from time immemorial share responsibility for wars, colonies, etc.  Some English people opposed the Randlord war against the Afrikaners, and advocated Anglo-German friendship not rivalry.  Some of the finest British patriots also sought peaceful co-existence with their racial cousins of Germany before and after 1933.<br>
The story of England since 1910 has ironically been one of gradual if bumpy decline, &#8220;a slow crumbling down the years&#8221; (Oswald Mosley, 1930). <br>
The English are one of many white peoples, all of whom should now stand together.  </p>

		<p>A few belated comments please on the Biblical issues raised in previous posts.<br>
The Bible consists of documents written over many centuries and eventually put into a finalised collection by the Roman Catholic Church; it is not just one book.<br>
Those Protestants who regard it as a single, inspired and also totally inerrant textbook disagree over its interpretation. This is notably relevant between those who think all races descend from Adam and Eve, and those who think only whites so descended. The problem they both have is that, according to the scriptural account(s) of the global Flood, all humans now existing descended later from the occupants of Noah&rsquo;s Ark. Either all races as diverse as Nordics and Hottentots descended from Noah&rsquo;s small family, or the ancestors of the non-white races were among the &#8220;beasts&#8221; taken on board. In any event, scriptural chronology puts the universal deluge only a few generations before several races were carefully depicted on Egyptian monuments.  No serious historian can totally swallow this &#8220;ark&#8221; story - quite apart from any evidence of human evolution, and racial migration, from the fossil record and DNA sequencing.<br>
What can be said is that neither the Old (Hebrew) nor the New (Greek) Testaments actually advocate or encourage racial crossing.  Reference to different nations and their habitations in the New Testament would suggest that ethnic variety is acceptable (to say the least) to the Creator, and if humans have good reasons to maintain it they would be acceptable too. </p>
