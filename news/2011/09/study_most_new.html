<h1>Study: Most New Texas Jobs Went to Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Byron York, Washington Examiner, September 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With both jobs and immigration likely topics of sharp debate at tonight&rsquo;s Republican debate here in Florida, a new report suggests that newly-arrived immigrants have filled a majority of new jobs created in Texas, home to Republican frontrunner Gov. Rick Perry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of jobs created in Texas since 2007, 81 percent were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers (legal and illegal),&#8221; says the report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates reduced levels of both legal and illegal immigration.  The report estimates that about 40 percent of the new jobs were taken by illegal immigrants, while 40 percent were taken by legal immigrants.  The vast majority of both groups, legal and illegal, were not American citizens.</p>
<p>Native-born Americans filled just 20 percent of the new jobs in Texas, the report says, even though &#8220;the native born accounted for 69 percent of the growth in Texas&rsquo; working-age population.&#8221; &#8220;Thus, even though natives made up most of the growth in potential workers, most of the job growth went to immigrants,&#8221; the report concludes.</p>
<p>The report is based on analysis of the Census Bureau&rsquo;s Current Population Survey.</p>
<p>The study notes that 56 percent of newly-arrived immigrants in Texas since 2007 have had a high-school degree or less.  But it also notes that &#8220;More than one out three&hellip;of newly arrived immigrants who took a job had at least some college.&#8221;  It would be a mistake, the report concludes, &#8220;to assume that immigrants are only competing for jobs at the bottom end of the labor market.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a press release accompanying the study, the Center for Immigration Studies makes a clear effort to cast doubt on Perry&rsquo;s record.  The relevant portion of that release:</p>
<blockquote>{snip}
<p>Some may argue that it was the arrival of immigrants in the state that stimulated what job growth there was for natives. But, if immigration stimulates job growth for natives, the numbers in Texas would look very different. The unemployment rate and the employment rate (share holding job) of natives in Texas show a dramatic deterioration during the recession that is similar to the rest of the country. Among the native-born, Texas ranks 22nd in terms of unemployment and 29th in terms of its employment rate. Outside of Texas many of the top immigrant-receiving states have the worst economies. Unemployment in the 10-top immigrant-receiving states in 2011 averaged 8.7 percent, compared to 7.2 percent on average in the 10 states where the fewest immigrants arrived since 2007. These figures do not settle the longstanding debate over the economics of immigration. What they do show is that high immigration is not necessarily associated with positive labor market outcomes for the native-born.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s one of those political believe-it-or-nots.  The GOP may well nominate STILL ANOTHER open borders bonehead, former Al-Gore-for-president Texas campaign chairman Rick Perry, 80 percent of whose &#8220;job creation&#8221; since 2007 went to the immigrants, 40 percent went to illegal aliens   &mdash;  - for whom he rolled out a Texas-sized red carpet since he became governor.  Consider:</p>
<p>1. A pioneer in pushing for in-state tuition for illegal aliens, Perry signed such a bill in 2001.</p>
<p>2. In 2001 speech in Mexico, Perry called for the &ldquo;free flow of individuals between these two countries who want to work and want to be an asset to our country and to Mexico.&rdquo; </p>
<p>3. Of Arizona&rsquo;s SB 1070, supported by 70 percent of Arizonans, &ldquo;It would not be the right direction for Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. Perry thinks any effort to rein in automatic birthright citizenship for children born to illegal aliens in the U. S. would be &ldquo;unconstitutional.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;E-Verify,&rdquo; says Perry, &ldquo;would not make a hill of beans difference when it comes to what&rsquo;s happening in America today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. Perry pans a border fence.  In 2001, Perry said it &ldquo;is idiocy. It absolutely would not work.&rdquo; </p>
<p>7. The PC term &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; is a natural. In a talk on his vision for Texas schools, Perry said, &ldquo;And that vision must include the children of undocumented workers.&rdquo; </p>
<p>8. Perry backed amnesty-pushing Rudy Guiliani for president in 2008.<br>

		<p>This is why I joined Numbers USA to fight against illegal immigration and to call for a massive reduction of legal immigration. They ARE taking our jobs away no matter what our politicians say.</p>
<p>In the end, the White middle class will be destroyed in this country if this is not stopped. Maybe we still have time. We must halt all illegal immigration AND place a 5-10 year moratorium on legal immigration.</p>
<p>Also, a vote for Rick Perry (should he be the presidential candidate) is a vote for continued illegal immigration and nonstop legal immigration.</p>

		<p>Of course. Who did not know this by now? We all know that it is 3rd world immigrants (legal and ILLEGAL) who get all the jobs. It is by DESIGN, folks. Of course, Perry won&rsquo;t accept any knowledge of this fact. He is a traitor just like most politicians are.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the Central American model that our betters think is so great. An easily manipulated under-class of human beings with IQs in the 80s and 90s is introduced to replace the American middle class wherever possible. This new underclass actually shows up to work, unlike those blacks, at least for the first two generations or so and is happy with any wage that exceeds the $3/day they earn in Guatemala and Honduras at the machidoras or in the fields.</p>
<p>And, unlike the traditional American middle class, this new underclass will not have the desire or wherewithal to fight those of wealth and birth after the globalist economic model crashes and the autocrat is introduced in whatever form he is presented.</p>
<p>These people are all too predictable. Madison saw them coming 230 years ago and wrote about it in Federalist 46 (the good guys win).</p>

We are aware that for comments approved between 15 hours ago from when now (now is about 11 PM ET Sept. 22), and some time on September 15, they are either missing altogether, or still there on the stories, though the story link from the front page is under-reporting the number of approved comments.</p>

 Also I wager that there are substantially fewer &#8216;Anglo&rsquo; Texans in employment now than 20 or 30 years ago.</p>

		<p>The only reason I can perceive that Perry is seen as a top contender is because the MSM tell us so.  The same goes for the contention that Bachman is losing strength.  <br>
We must always remember that the MSM are a liberal bastion, and they want a GOP candidate who will repel as many conservative voters as possible, thus keeping them away from the polls and assuring Obama&rsquo;s reelection.  <br>
And don&rsquo;t forget that, ultimately, it&rsquo;s the voters who decide the nominees.  We&rsquo;re stuck with the candidates who have chosen to run, but we&rsquo;re not stuck with electing any particular one of them.</p>

		<p> To say that rick Perry is soft on immigration is an understatement. When it comes to immigration, the man is a George Bush on steroids. He wants to be president of Mexifornia, not the United States. He&rsquo;s a member in good standing of the traitorious cheap labor crowd. I won&rsquo;t be voting for this bum; send him packing. </p>

		<p>In the debate last night, one of the candidates (Santorum?) said that Perry supports bi-national health insurance (Mexico and US).  Whatever that is.  He said to Perry that even Obama wouldn&rsquo;t support that.  Perry didn&rsquo;t deny this.  I wish one of them would have hit Perry with some of the information in this article. </p>

		<p>I personally am getting more and more annoyed with most of the present contenders.  Most of the others continue to spout the same things they&rsquo;ve already spouted in the previous debates. The bickering and book promoting between Perry and Romney is sophomoric, childish and is beginning to look like a peeing contest.<br>
Santorum seems like a good guy but he  doesn&rsquo;t have the much revered &#8220;GRAVITAS&#8221; .</p>

<p>Yes. Believe he report.  The Center for Immigration Studies&#8221; could not, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered &#8220;leftist.&#8221;  Its researchers, who appear regularly in the media, tilt to the restrictionist   &mdash;  - versus the open borders   &mdash;  - side of the immigration debate. </p>
<p>Former Al-Gore-for-President backer Rick Perry indeed has a catastrophic record on immigration.  Apart from the huge immigrant and illegal alien employment gains in Texas, under Perry, still another way to understand the eighteen-year Bush-Perry legacy in Texas is a blog post from the Houston Chronicle on the former director of the U. S. Census Bureau, Texas demographer Steve Murdock: </p>
<p>Texas demographer: &#8216;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos&rsquo;<br>

<p>OPENING PARAGRAPHS:</p>
<p>Looking at population projections for Texas, demographer Steve Murdock concludes: &#8220;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos.&#8221;   </p>
<p>Two of every three Texas children are now non-Anglo and the trend line will become even more pronounced in the future, said Murdock, former U.S. Census Bureau director and now director of the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Texas population can be divided into two groups, he said. One is an old and aging Anglo and the other is young and minority. Between 2000 and 2040, the state&rsquo;s public school enrollment will see a 15 percent decline in Anglo children while Hispanic children will make up a 213 percent increase, he said.<br>

		<p>If Rick Perry gets the GOP nomination, and god forbid, the Presidency, it will be an absolute disaster.</p>
<p>In several debates now he has &#8216;doubled down&rsquo; on his leftist open-borders, pro-illegals views. If he wins, it will be seen as a vindication of those views, and Perry, backed by the elites, won&rsquo;t hesitate to push amnesty and more. </p>
<p>Perry must be defeated.</p>

When it comes to immigration, Ron Paul is one of the worst, second only to Rick Perry. </p>
<p>He said some good things in the 2008 election but since then he has made a tilt towards left-libertarianism, as evidenced by his stance in &#8216;Liberty Defined&rsquo;. He never brings up immigration, or border security during his speeches, and the when he has been forced to during the debates, his answers have been less than satisfactory, to say the least.</p>
<p>Paul has a lot of good ideas but unless he addresses immigration it is irrelevant; because if we lose America, it becomes an alien nation, then all other issues don&rsquo;t matter. </p>

		<p>On Newt Gingrich, he&rsquo;s the only person on that stage who sounds like he can think on his feet.  Too bad for him that he has a track record, is a crypto-globalist, and has personal morals that make Bill Clinton look like a monk.  </p>
<p>On Ron Paul, I have to address this hobby horse of his about border fences.  Yes, it&rsquo;s true any physical border security that could be used to keep them out could be used to keep us in.  But the reality of world history is that the walls/fencing are only used for the purposes that their builders intended.  For instance, the Berlin Wall was built to keep Easterners from fleeing, not to keep Westerners from coming in.  While it could have been used for both, it was used to keep Easterners in.  And that&rsquo;s the way it will be with the border fence, it will be used only for its intended purpose, to keep illegal aliens out, not to keep us in.</p>

		<p>Did you notice how when Rick Perry announced his candidacy he was <i>immediately</i> declared one of the front runners and magically polled at 30% or better?  There is no doubt in my mind that the media is promoting Rick Perry because he is an open borders Republican, just as they promoted John McCain in 2008.</p>
<p>Remember than making white people as small a minority as possible as quickly as possible is priority number one for the left today, and the left controls most of the media.<br>

<p>In Texas 81 percent of the jobs created since 2007 have gone to immigrants who arrived here since 2007. Ninety-three percent of these immigrants aren&rsquo;t citizens. An estimated 50 percent are illegal immigrants. In the second quarter of this year, the unemployment rate for natives in Texas, 8.1 percent, ranked 22nd in the country, and the share of natives holding a job, 66.6 percent, ranked 29th. <br>
