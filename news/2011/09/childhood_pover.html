<h1><a href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=147">Childhood Poverty Among Hispanics Sets Record, Leads Nation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mark Lopez and Gabriel Velasco, Pew Hispanic Center, September 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More Latino children are living in poverty  &mdash;  6.1 million in 2010  &mdash;  than children of any other racial or ethnic group. This marks the first time in U.S. history that the single largest group of poor children is not white. In 2010, 37.3% of poor children were Latino, 30.5% were white and 26.6% were black.</p>
<p>This negative milestone for Hispanics is a product of their growing numbers, high birth rates and declining economic fortunes. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Hispanics today make up a record 16.3% of the total U.S. population. But they comprise an even larger share  &mdash;  23.1%  &mdash;  of the nation&rsquo;s children, a disparity driven mainly by high birth rates among Hispanic immigrants.</p>
<p>Of the 6.1 million Latino children living in poverty, more than two-thirds (4.1 million) are the children of immigrant parents. The other 2 million are the children of parents born in the U.S. Among the 4.1 million impoverished Latino children of immigrants, the vast majority (86.2%) were born in the U.S.</p>

		<p>This injustice only highlights how much more work we have to do in making the American Creed of Equality distributed more fairly to all.  That Hispanics are over represented in these traumatic statistics proves that our exclusionary immigration policies are hurting &#8220;the least of these&#8221; in unacceptable ways.  We must overturn systemic bias and institutional racism by welcoming our Hispanic brothers and sisters into our shared lives.  Affirmative Action rules must be amended immediately to bring about positive change for those whom we&rsquo;ve exclude for too long.  We must welcome all voices to the conversation.</p>
<p>We must keep saying the Tea Party is racist.  We must kick Phil Kent off the Ga. Enforcement Board.</p>
<p>Whitey Americans must learn that their privileges are short lived and they should embrace change.</p>

Really? Because I thought it was a product of their being unskilled, dull-witted underachievers with little education and even less English. </p>

		<p>Perhaps the reason for the &#8220;impoverished&#8221; status of so many Hispanic immigrant children is the fact of their parents&rsquo;:  1) recent arrival; 2) limited English-speaking skills; 3) limited education; and 4) receipt of large sums of noncash public benefits (e.g., food stamps, Medicaid, housing subsidies), which are not officially counted as income.  Of course, the Pew Center is not permitted to mention such inconvenient facts. </p>

		<p>If they are here illegally, than they do not have any right to complain.  In their countries of origin, over 90% of them would be considered to be living in poverty if our standards are used.</p>

		<p>Occasionally, touches of sanity appear in the mainstream media on the subject of immigration.  One rare occasion is illustrated below:</p>
<p>&#8220;By default, our present policy is to import poor people. &hellip; We need an immigration policy that makes sense. My oft-stated belief is that legal immigration should favor the high-skilled over the low-skilled. They will assimilate quickest and aid the economy the most&#8221; (&#8220;Importing Poverty,&#8221; Robert J. Samuelson, economics columnist, Washington Post, Sept. 5, 2007).</p>
<p>Granted, the reasoning is unsophisticated, but ponder the risk Samuelson took in making the statement above.  And he knows it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Among many analysts, journalists and politicians, it&rsquo;s politically or psychologically discomforting to discuss these issues candidly.&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Bottom line: We have a lot of poor Hispanic children because we imported a lot of poor Hispanic adults. There is a connection. </p>

		<p>Fact: more than that percentage are poor and impoverished in their countries of origin.</p>
<p>Fact: Most of the immigrants (legal and illegal) from latin america are from the bottom third of society (amerindians, peasants, etc)</p>
<p>Fact: People do not magically change their cultural values, skills, education level, outlook or fortune merely by crossing a border.</p>
<p>Fact: As others have noted, they are only bringing their third world ways with them.  It&rsquo;s not like coming to America &#8216;made&rsquo; them poor, and it&rsquo;s not like they came here and were suddenly oppressed and thrust into poverty.  They came poor already.</p>
<p>Fact: They came here because there is no &#8216;social justice&rsquo; in their lands.  They are demanding it of us, we who HAVE NO CONNECTION to them or their values.</p>
<p>Fact: All this hispanic heritage month hoopla is making indians from southern mexico or dominican mestizos feel as if &#8216;they&rsquo; belong here.  All the old &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; from centuries ago who found themselves in these borders were SPANIARDS and their white descendants.  They assimilated long ago.</p>
<p>Fact: They will find some way to blame this on whitey and suck more billions from us, beyond all the freebies that drew them here in the first place!</p>

		<p>This is a GREAT issue for us to push at political rallies in the next year; <br>
Somehow, we need to get stealth question- askers to the microphone to ask repubs and dems  why we&rsquo;re importing poverty on a mass scale. Also, we need people to wave signs asking the same. We need people to video the incumbents and challengers, avoiding the issue, and to post them on YouTube. We can get the buzz going, on the street, that candidates ignore the elephant of immigration.<br>
Look, people move in packs. Nobody on 1950 would have believed America would be swept by intense self- hating marxism in the decades to come. No sane white would accept the idea of suffering blacks everywhere, and supporting them. But over time, that became the norm, the unassailable way of things. </p>
<p>Why is such social and political change so impossible for an intelligent white man to affect?<br>
It is totally possible. But you have to be energetic. The dope-heads of the 1960s were energetic, running on pure nonsense.<br>
Food for thought.<br>

		<p>I have a feeling we&rsquo;ll soon be hearing as much about Hispanic poverty as Black poverty.  Of course, the media will always imply White racism as the cause (i.e., White taxpayer voted against state funding for an additional 150 bilingual teachers aids in urban cities, ect.).  Of course, the article didn&rsquo;t fail to mention that 86.2% of the children were born in the U.S. so they are now <i>our</i> children and <i>our</i> future.  We should all sacrifice to support them and give them every advantage, just as we would our own biological children, even if it means we can&rsquo;t afford as many of our own biological children (Whites must stop being so selfish and racist).  After all, they are Americans, and what is the difference between one American and another (other than the fact that some have bee irreparably cheated by racism)?</p>
<p>Ironically, our new additions will do more to foster White solidarity than prosperity ever could.  But of course, by then saving America in it&rsquo;s current form will be impossible.</p>

Your &#8220;people&#8221; will never be embraced just for the disrespect you show towards others and bring into this once great country Unlike the government who gives you everything, and  all your kind, you will never be given respect or citizenship from &#8220;Whitey&#8221; until you earn these. Now &#8220;Cowboy Up&#8221; or get your a** out of here. You&rsquo;re not liked or wanted.</p>

		<p>They call the parents immigrants, leaving out whether or not they&rsquo;re here legally. They left that out on purpose. If they&rsquo;re illegal they aren&rsquo;t supposed to be here in the first place. The article is just a call for more money to be sent to these worthy supplicants. </p>

		<p>So much for the oft-repeated claim that immigration &#8216;boosts&rsquo; the American economy.<br>
 It is evident that mass hispanic immigration only serves to pauperize America.Just what is the logic of importing a mass of paupers?, why just transfer poverty from Mexico to the USA?<br>
 Plainly it is a destructive and self-defeating policy.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m remembering that poster to an article on American Renaissance from about a week ago, who had the incredible audacity to claim that Mestizos and Asians do not feast off of the public dole - and then we see the harsh reality that for as long as that Southern border is not sealed tighter than a drum, we are importing POVERTY and a whole new underclass.   </p>
<p>Who will join the already massive black underclass and then they&rsquo;ll both fight over who gets the biggest slice of whitey&rsquo;s paycheck and who gets the greatest racially based preference over whitey in jobs, at college campuses, and in government influence and political power.</p>
<p>Whites are going to be literally DEVOURED by these two competing underclasses, unless and until we demand our ethno-state.</p>

		<p>Having lived on the &#8220;border&#8221; for 15 years immigrants follow a tried and true pattern, cross the river and work hard for maybe two years, then &#8220;catch onto the system.&#8221;  From then on, the American taxpayer is bilked for all possible monies.  The best defense against this type is an honest type who never made the transition from hard worker to lay about.</p>
<p>Our gov exploits all of us to ruin the nation.  Do you realize if all Americans (since founding), had the same values as todays peoples, this nation would never have been built, and would never have made the essential contributions to the world we can not count.</p>

		<p>by their standards, the illegal alien mexicans etc are living a middle class life. They are also lying on the government forms. <br>
 I live next to an illegal alien from Mexico or central America, his white american wife is having their second kid, they bought a second car. They are on welfare and waiting for a section 8 coupon. They get food stamps and medical. He works under the table doing landscaping and manual work. It&rsquo;s like that all over.<br>
  If they were having a hard time they would self-deport, which they rarely do. They also send billions home to Mexico every year, yet all the mexicans I see are fat and well-dressed. Poor people look poor and don&rsquo;t have money to spare. They aren&rsquo;t poor they are liars and users</p>

		<p>Maybe Uncle Sam needs to send them the same type of letter he sent to me in the Sixties when my husband was drafted into the Army.  In paraphrase it read: Don&rsquo;t come along with him to the Army base.  He will not be able to support you.</p>
<p>(I went.  I got two jobs.  We saved our money.  We did just fine.)</p>
<p>In the northern Midwest I&rsquo;ve seen something different.  When I was a kid we had seasonal Mexican migrant farm workers.  They&rsquo;d arrive in the spring and the kids could catch a month or two of school.  They lived in shacks farmers provided them or in an abandoned building on Main Street.</p>
<p>We had no Catholic church, no Mexican food stores.  No one of us spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>It took a couple of generations but several of the families managed to eventually make the permanent move. They are fully integrated and functional citizens.</p>
<p>What changed these &#8220;peasants&#8221; into Americans?  They had to do it with little help from Uncle Sam.  That means they had to be mindful of their American hosts as they were dependent on the good graces of the community for their livelihood. And like proper Americans everywhere at that time we welcomed and helped the good people who were trying to change their circumstances.</p>
<p>I think you call that the old-fashioned way to citizenship.  Help anyone too much and you cripple their development.  People value what they need to struggle to earn.</p>
<p>Times and people have changed.</p>

		<p>Well America is after all a Nation of Immigrants&hellip;and we all know that when German&rsquo;s, Poles, Russians, and the Irish came to America they were only able to lift themselves out of poverty through Government programs. My oh my how those Europeans took advantage of the in-State tuition, generous welfare benefits, and medical care.</p>
<p>Oh wait that didn&rsquo;t happen at all. This is just another white guilt sympathy statistic for a failed people from a failed Country. Call me cold-hearted but my compassion has been exhausted for the citizens of the World. I&rsquo;m a Scottish-Canadian and my allegiance is with European people&rsquo;s all over the World. Because I would feel safe and comfortable only in a European populated, European built Nation. Period.</p>

		<p>THE LUCRATIVE PHONY ID BUSINESS  &mdash;  -DOCUMENTS FOR A PRICE July 21, 2006   &mdash;   Pelcastre brothers, Angel and Jorge, Dallas, Texas, were a walking threat to US national security, expert document forgers who, for a few thousand dollars, could give anyone a new identity.</p>
<p>The Texas brothers turned a NJ hotel room into a business office and were readying a massive cache of fake Social Security cards for delivery to a local NJ identity broker. The Texas brothers were a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for a myriad of fake US documents, including birth certificates, Social Security cards, driver&rsquo;s licenses for any state in the US, passports and resident alien cards, said state police. </p>
<p>Officers happened upon two cars bearing Texas plates in a NJ hotel parking lot. Authorities wouldn&rsquo;t identify the NJ hotel by name for fear it would spark retribution from savage drug cartels operating in the US. </p>
<p>The Texas brothers were followed to a NJ office supply store nearby where they purchased computer supplies. Officers then followed the Texans to a NJ storage facility in Secaucus, NJ, where the Texans loaded several boxes into a car. One of them stood lookout. </p>
<p>L/E approached the Texas brothers when they returned to the NJ hotel and questioned them separately. The Texas brothers consented to a search. </p>
<p>Police recovered laminating sheets with built-in security features, pages of blank documents waiting for fake names and information, finished documents, computers and software to create the fake IDs. </p>
<p>All told, the haul was worth about $500,000 on the street. Police also recovered $6,000 in cash, which was the first payment from a NJ fake document broker for a shipment of 500 fake Social Security cards. #### </p>

		<p>Earned Income Tax Credit is available only to immigrant workers who obtain legal work status. But the law allows immigrants to claim EITC for up to three years prior to obtaining that status. Workers simply file a tax return for the years in which they were not legally eligible to work in the US. The most widespread abuse stems from the requirement that children live with the worker for more than six months of the year. IRS does little to verify the claim. Many immigrants claim non-existent children, or claim children who they&rsquo;ve left behind with relatives. Those with two or more children and income below $32,121 could get as much as $4,008. It is estimated that illegals got $22 billion. <br>

		<p>Illegals are more likely to be collecting US government checks than picking crops, despite the incessant latino propaganda. They use multiple identities to suckup numerous govt freebies, riding the US gravy train. Jose Madrigal, the Washington state rapist, had some 30 identities. Another illegal used multiple fake ID&rsquo;s to collect $3.5 million unemployment checks.<br>
Most of these &#8220;impoverished immigrants&#8221; pay several thousand dollars to establish multiple identities. They also get SS no&rsquo;s for anchor babies and use the no&rsquo;s themselves to suckup numerous US govt freebies. (more below) </p>
<p>RIDING THE US GRAVY TRAIN An illegal alien w/ wife and five children violates our borders. He gets a job mowing lawns for $5.00 or 6.00/hour. At that low wage, with six dependents, he pays no income tax, so each year, he files an Income Tax Return to get &#8220;EITC  &mdash;  -earned income credit&#8221; of up to $3,200 scot-free. He qualifies for Section 8 housing and subsidized rent. He qualifies for food stamps and no deductible, no co-pay free health care. His children get free school breakfasts and lunches. The kids qualify for monthly SSI checks, faking ADD; the illegal and his wife get SSI if they fake being aged, blind or disabled; SSI qualifies them for Medicare. Plus illegals don&rsquo;t worry about pricey items like car insurance, life insurance, or homeowners insurance, and qualify for relief from high energy bills. </p>

		<p>When you have 17 people and 3 families under one roof pooling their 6 poverty level incomes, as a whole, they are not really in poverty. Same with the Asians.  3 SSI elders bring in $1,800 per month, a nice addition to any household.<br>

		<p>It is the responsibility of the American taxpayer to encourage the world&rsquo;s poor to show up on our doorstep and fund them into prosperity!  3 out of 5 Hispanics do not have a High School education and their children are at the mercy of their income which officially is zero. The government mixes in the children of illegal aliens with native born and that&rsquo;s how the 1 in 6 children living in poverty number is figured. We are importing poverty from Mexico.</p>

		<p>How in the world would they even go about getting accurate statistics in a group that has a large illegal alien population that is getting paid a large percentage of income &ldquo;under the table&rdquo;?<br>
Also, this article fails to note that a lot of these families include multiple workers in the home who pool their money. Taken individually, it may appear that members of the family are poor, but taking the entire household income together, it is often otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, let&rsquo;s define &ldquo;poor&rdquo;. If you define it as income only, and exclude all the freebies that are available courtesy of the American taxpayer, you will get one definition. If you include the free lunches and breakfasts for your kids, free medical care, food stamps, etc you have a totally different definition. I am sure the first definition of poor is the one being used for this study. </p>

		<p>I believe that many hispanic illegals will work themselves out of poverty&hellip;&hellip;.  at least, many more than blacks that have to have it handed to them for the most part and even then, fall back into poverty quickly&hellip;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many immigrants claim non-existent children, or claim children who they&rsquo;ve left behind with relatives. Those with two or more children and income below $32,121 could get as much as $4,008.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In other words, every illegal invader in this country is getting a &#8220;tax&#8221; return! What do they have to lose. Technically, they only exist on paper and that paper is fake!</p>
<p>The fraud and abuse is staggering by mexican illegal invaders and their anchor baby spawn!</p>

		<p>One other problem with the EITC is that it is suffering from mission creep.  There used to be a lot of rules about who could get it, and with good reason - Because EITC is essentially a negative income tax, it was basically a welfare program implicit in the tax code.  It used to be that you had to be an adult working a job with dependent children under a certain age and have an income level within a relevant and meager range.  Now, the rules have been so loosened (thank you &#8220;Mr. Hispanic Family Values&#8221; Bush 43) that I almost qualify for it.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute - did they just contradict a major liberal dogma?  For the first time in history the single largest group of poor children is not white.</p>
<p>Read that again - first time in history the single largest group of poor children is not white.</p>
<p>Yet for decades liberal dogma has maintained that poverty explains black crime and education levels.</p>
<p>My world has been turned upside down - oh me oh my.</p>
