			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rick Klein, ABC News, September 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Speaking in the months after her husband&rsquo;s assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy was so upset with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that she told a friend and interviewer that she could barely look at images of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just can&rsquo;t see a picture of Martin Luther King without thinking, you know, that man&rsquo;s terrible,&#8221; Mrs. Kennedy said, as part of an oral history series of interviews released this month.</p>
<p>The widowed first lady soured on King as a result of secret wiretaps arranged by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover had told President Kennedy that King tried to arrange a sex party while in town for the March on Washington, and told Robert Kennedy that King had made derogatory comments during the president&rsquo;s funeral, Mrs. Kennedy recalled.</p>
<p>But as for what was actually said by King and his circle, history remains uncertain. The original surveillance tapes involving King have never been released publicly, and are under seal by court order until 2027.</p>
<p>Rep. John Lewis, legendary civil rights leader and friend of King, told ABC News that he believes Hoover concocted damaging material about King to give to the Kennedys because &#8220;he wanted to destroy the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mrs. Kennedy said Robert Kennedy told her he had heard FBI wiretaps in which he said that King had made derogatory comments in private about Cardinal Richard Cushing, who delivered President Kennedy&rsquo;s eulogy at his November 1963 funeral.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kennedy says Bobby told her &#8220;He made fun of Cardinal Cushing and said that he was drunk at it. And things about they almost dropped the coffin and  &mdash;  well, I mean Martin Luther King is really a tricky person,&#8221; Mrs. Kennedy said.</p>
<p>She also said that the president himself told her about surveillance suggesting that King sought to organize a sex party while in town for the March on Washington in August 1963.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me of a tape that the FBI had of Martin Luther King when he was here for the freedom march. And he said this with no bitterness or anything, how he was calling up all these girls and arranging for a party of men and women, I mean, sort of an orgy in the hotel, and everything,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John and Jacqueline, said her mother&rsquo;s comments about King are evidence of the &#8220;poisonous&#8221; activities Hoover was engaged in, as he ruled the FBI as his private fiefdom.</p>
<p>She said the comments didn&rsquo;t reflect her mother&rsquo;s true feelings about King, pointing out that she was proud to attend his funeral in 1968.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously J. Edgar Hoover had passed on something that Martin Luther King said about my father&rsquo;s funeral, to Uncle Bobby and to Mommy. And obviously, she was upset about that,&#8221; Caroline Kennedy told ABC&rsquo;s Diane Sawyer.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;If you asked her what she thought of Martin Luther King overall  &mdash;  I mean she admired him tremendously,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Hoover&rsquo;s FBI tapped King&rsquo;s telephones from 1963 through 1966, based on the pretext that King was being influenced by Communist interests. {snip}</p>
<p>Hoover kept a steady stream of damaging information about King flowing to both Kennedy brothers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mrs. Kennedy&rsquo;s recollections of her husband&rsquo;s feelings toward King were far warmer. She said he went out of his way to emphasize he wouldn&rsquo;t &#8220;judge anyone&#8221; based on what he was told about the FBI surveillance.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said what an incredible speaker he was during that freedom march thing,&#8221; she recalled.</p>

		<p>Sounds like Caroline is a little intimidated. The prism of time has warped her sensibilities. True the FBI does frame people from time to time but King&rsquo;s own compadres say he was a phoney and was hurting the cause in the end. </p>
<p>My guess is that Kennedy and Bobby had real misgivings about the whole movement and the fact that it was totally orchestrated by behind the scenes puppeteers who manipulated everything. </p>
<p>Here is an idea release the tapes and lets hold them up to the light of day and see how the facts jell with the proposed evidence. </p>

<p><i>But as for what was actually said by King and his circle, history remains uncertain. The original surveillance tapes involving King have never been released publicly, and are under seal by court order until 2027.</i></p>
<p><br>
Well, we don&rsquo;t know everything that was said, but I think we know a little more than the above implies we do. </p>
<p>I seem to remember reading, possibly even here on AR, about MLK applying some of his trademark dirty humor to the JFK funeral. From what I recall, King&rsquo;s remarks were far more obnoxious and tasteless than what ABC News is willing to state. I know most of the bad stuff about MLK, but I recall being utterly shocked that he was a man of such base character to speak both smuttily and callously about a recently deceased president   &mdash;   not to mention a recently deceased president who had been a SUPPORTER of King&rsquo;s. For me, it&rsquo;s pretty much the worst thing MLK ever said or did   &mdash;   and the widowed Jackie Kennedy was entirely within her rights to find him &#8220;a terrible man.&#8221; </p>
<p>Also, nice try, ABC, in your attempt to pin it all on big bad J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover could only pass along what King actually said and did; so don&rsquo;t shoot the messenger. </p>
<p><br>
<i>Hoover kept a steady stream of damaging information about King flowing to both Kennedy brothers.</i></p>
<p>Of course Hoover did. That was his job. That&rsquo;s what you do when you&rsquo;re director of the FBI: you pass along the intelligence you&rsquo;ve gathered to the White House. If the information is &#8220;damaging&#8221; then maybe the person under surveillance should think about changing their ways. </p>
<p>2027 can&rsquo;t come soon enough. </p>

		<p> My opinion of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&rsquo; judgment just went up about 90 percent. I know that Caroline Kennedy is trying to pretty it up by blaming it all on alleged &#8220;lies&#8221; by J. Edgar Hoover, but I think every word said about King is probably true.</p>
<p> And, by the way, if those surveillance tapes and other information don&rsquo;t reveal utterly damning things about Martin Luther King, why has a court sealed them until 2027? He&rsquo;s been a beneficiary of a government cover-up ever since the day he was killed.</p>

<p>No, the rule should be: &#8220;Judge, and prepare to be judged.&#8221; This holds men accountable. The &#8220;judge not&#8221; rule is just a free pass for the louts not to be condemned by the righteous and faithful.   </p>

		<p>Well, just release that file. I was surprised that they did not release after thirty five years as they are normally supposed to do. And 2027 is how long we have to wait? And then I suppose a bunch of stuff will be redacted what they call it, and no one allowed to listen to the tapes.</p>
<p>Hoover had a hate of King that was profound? But other FBI men have also written in their memoirs that much of what Hoover said was not concocted. So who knows.  </p>

		<p>In is interesting, to say the least, that Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John and Jacqueline, who later in the referred  article obliquely defends MLK and says her mother&rsquo;s comments about King were evidence of the &ldquo;poisonous&rdquo; activities of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, was also the person responsible for the release of the Jackie Kennedy tapes. Besides the revelations about MLK, in these tapes Jacqueline Kennedy reveals her belief that Johnson and a cabal of Texas tycoons orchestrated the murder of her husband by gunman Lee Harvey Oswald. And that the Dallas murder was part of a larger conspiracy to allow Johnson to become American President in his own right. What is interesting about this sorted affair is that Caroline Kennedy released these tapes as part of a deal brokered with ABC to squash an exposé on the Kennedy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;She [Caroline] apparently cut a deal to release these to keep a mini-series from being aired. The mini-series was very damaging to the Kennedy&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The question arises as to what could have been so damaging to the Kennedy&rsquo;s that<br>
Caroline was willing to sully her parents reputation by disclosing her mother&rsquo;s romantic affairs and her father&rsquo;s infidelities in order to keep it silent? &ldquo;It certainly wasn&rsquo;t a financial decision.&rdquo; <br>

<p>What a truely demented woman shes turned out to be! Not a word about the repulsive actions and statements of the liberal Saint MLK, just the &#8220;poisonous&#8221; activities of Hoover. Notice she didn&rsquo;t say any of it was false! Shes another White princess thats too stupid to see that shes part of the problem. I fondly remember when this bimbo had lunch with the &#8220;Rev.&#8221; $harpton ( in Harlem ) when she was thinking of running for that senator seat - pure stupidity, and don&rsquo;t you know the &#8220;Rev.&#8221; had a good laugh with the &#8220;brothas&#8221; afterwards. She really needs to get out more and see that not all blacks are like &#8220;Miss Matty&#8221; the housekeeper or the ones that ask her if she&rsquo;d like bacon or sausage. <br>
Does mental illness run in the Kennedy clan? I can&rsquo;t think of one of them that ever gave me the impression of being all there - especialy the current generation. Hopefully poor Caroline will come to her senses before &#8220;Amy Biehl&#8221; gets stomped into her forehead.</p>
<p> *She said the comments didn&rsquo;t reflect her mother&rsquo;s true feelings about King, pointing out that she was proud to attend his funeral in 1968.</p>
<p>Yeah, she just wanted to make sure that SOB was dead!</p>
<p>*&ldquo;If you asked her what she thought of Martin Luther King overall &mdash; I mean she admired him tremendously,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Yes and notice that she always admired him and all other blacks from a &#8220;tremendously&#8221; long distance! I never remember ol Jackie ever &#8220;slumming it up&#8221; in the hood with the sistas!</p>

		<p>According to Raplh Abernathy during the funeral MLK remarked that Jackie looked like she wanted to &#8221; jump in the coffin and four letter word for make love  JFK.&#8221;  MLK also made many rude remarks about the Roman Catholic service, calling the bishops in their robes &#8220;fags&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ralph Abernathy and the rest of the Southern Crhistian Leadership Conference did not appreciate White led NAACP ADL inserting the communist tainted MLK into the organization as anointed leader of the blacks.</p>
<p>SCLC was a venerable civil rights organization of black preachers that had worked for civil rights for 30 years before they were forced to accept MLK as the messiah.</p>
<p>Many thought MLK was selected because of his and his wife&rsquo;s youth.  They were in their early 30&rsquo;s while the rest were in their 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s.  MLK was fat and ugly.  Wife Coretta was beautiful  Most of the pictures of MLK had beautiful Coretta next to him as a way of presenting him as a good christian family man.</p>
<p>Coretta looked a lot like Jackie, same high cheekbones, broad face, snub nose and identical hairstyle.  Many of the adoring magazine articles at the time called her the black Jackie.</p>

claim that J. Edgar Hoover fooled Jackie with a made-up story about MLK mocking JFK&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>Alas, the story is true. And King&rsquo;s disgusting jokes about JFK&rsquo;s and Jackie&rsquo;s sex lives were the among the least offensive incidents recorded by the FBI.<br>

<p>Thanks for the information, but what this paragraph has to do with the subject is questionable.  I recall it, but I thought then, as I do now, that it was an early example of coddling blacks by over-complimenting them, giving them more credit than they merit, etc.  It was part of or one of the early causes or expressions of white guilt that blacks and communists were working hard to establish.  But there is no way Coretta King compares to Jackie Kennedy when it comes to substance and style.  She was at best a black copycat.</p>

		<p>MLK was a plagiarist, which is to say, a liar and a thief. Worse, he was a consummate hypocrite. Far from thinking we should all be treated according to the &#8220;content of our character,&#8221; he said in that Playboy interview that he would favor racial preferences for blacks. I am 60 years old. I was in high school when King was muredered, and I recall how the attitutes towards him changed. Before the shooting King was in disfavor among blacks. Makcolm X was more popular among blacks, especially the young ones-the same blacks who today drip honey over his name. I regret that King&rsquo;s icon pollutes the same avenue in which Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s memorial stands, and I regret even more that blacks cannot produce even one deserving hero. Let&rsquo;s open those secret documents. That information is the property of the Amercian people.</p>

<p><i>FBI sources told Taylor Branch about a surveillance tape of King watching a televised rerun of the Kennedy funeral.

<p>As for the implication that Hoover wiretapped mlk&rsquo;s phones:  </p>
<p><i>On October 10, 1963, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy&hellip;authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation to begin wiretapping the telephones of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. Kennedy believed that one of King&rsquo;s closest advisers was a top-level member of the American Communist Party, and that King had repeatedly misled Administration officials about his ongoing close ties with the man.</i></p>

<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>He told me (Mrs. Kennedy) of a tape that the FBI had of Martin Luther King when he was here for the freedom march&hellip;And how he was calling up all these girls and arranging for a party of men and women, I mean, sort of an orgy in the hotel, and everything,&rsquo; she said.</i></p>
<p>Hit a little too close to home, Mrs. Kennedy??</p>
<p><i>Newman and other agents assigned to guard Kennedy soon learned that he led a double life. He was the charismatic leader of the free world. But in his other life, he was the cheating, reckless husband whose aides snuck women into the White House to appease his sexual appetite.</i></p>

		<p>&#8220;But there is no way Coretta King compares to Jackie Kennedy when it comes to substance and style. She was at best a black copycat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly.  </p>
<p>If you look at pictures of those adored saints such as Angela Davis, Huey Newton, Katherine Cleaver and others, you will notice that they are one and all both very light skinned and very good looking.  Just like Obama and Holder. If Michelle were light skinned and pretty you can bet we would be seeing a lot more pictures of her.</p>
<p>Abernathy&rsquo;s point was that he and the other SCLC preachers and their wives were in their 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s and getting wrinkled.  He claimed that MLK was selected to be the front man by CPUSA, NAACP, ADL and the rest partly because he had a very light skinned pretty wife who did look a lot like Jackie. SCLC also thought it ridiculous that Michael King changed his name to Martin Luther</p>
<p>The black leadership that had been working for equal rights for 30 or 40 years did not appreciate MLK suddenly elevated to black messiah because his wife was younger and prettier than theirs.</p>
<p>Anyone old enough to remember those times remembers that almost all pictures of unattractive MLK had the pretty Coretta right there to detract from his plain round chubby face.</p>

		<p>For all you youngsters out there waiting around for the records on King to be released in 2027, forget it.  It will be discovered that these records have long disappeared and can&rsquo;t be found. Just like some of the critical evidence relating to the JFK assassination.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no evidence that LBJ had anything to do do with the JFK murder&hellip;&hellip;.except for one tantalizing item.  Seems that a fingerprint was found on the sixth floor of the depository building that was never matched until many years later.  </p>

		<p>#27 is right.  If current trends continue, there will be less whites by 2027 and there might be less whites then who are willing to stand up to marxists and anti-white people.  By then, the people who had the power or ca-ho-nees to speak up will be dead.  This is assuming even IF it gets released.  </p>
<p>However, however, there is a flip side that I hope pans out.  Soon, the majority of whites will wake up, stand up to the people who do us harm, cut off any funding going to them, get a racial backbone and demand small government so we can be free to pursue our own destinies.  It seems like more and more whites are waking up, which I hope happens.  The best thing a black president did was wake the majority of whites up the black supremacy and how all this &#8220;civil rights&#8221; talk was just code speech to take away freedoms from whites.</p>

appears to have no cognizance of this.  Dr. King&rsquo;s associates<br>
appear to have made a distinction between the &#8220;Martin&#8221; they<br>
originally knew and the increasing number of mentally disorganized &#8220;outcroppings&#8221; that came to characterize his media<br>
saturated life.  Isn&rsquo;t the real story more that he was just a talented mediocrity that was reinvented by the media and by &#8220;our&#8221; political system for racial mileage and that all sorts of personal aberrations were the outcome for him of his &#8220;success&#8221;??</p>

<p>The Atlantic reports in <i>The FBI and MLK</i>:</p>
<p><i>The crucial figure was Stanley David Levison, a New York lawyer and businessman who first met Martin Luther King in 1956, just as the young minister was being catapulted to national fame The FBI knew.. that Levison had secretly served as one of the top two financiers for the Communist Party USA in the years just before he met King.</i></p>
<p><i>In the months immediately following Levison&rsquo;s visible departure from CPUSA activities, his selfless assistance to King soon established him as the young minister&rsquo;s most influential counselor&hellip;With the FBI suggesting that Levison&rsquo;s seeming departure from the CPUSA was in all likelihood a ruse, Robert Kennedy and his aides felt they had little choice but to assume the worst and act as defensively as possible. The Kennedy Administration kept itself at arm&rsquo;s length from King, and events quickly spiraled, with the federal government undertaking extensive electronic surveillance of King himself.</i></p>

		<p>As far as what the pot says about the kettle  &mdash;  Jackie Bouvier Kennedy was herself, like her husband, something of a spoiled brat and egoist, with little genuine or enduring understanding<br>
of life beneath her high social stratum.  It is significant that she was not taken in by the media MLK but that is no basis for<br>

		<p>&#8220;Many thought MLK was selected because of his and his wife&rsquo;s youth.  MLK was fat and ugly. Wife Coretta was beautiful Most of the pictures of MLK had beautiful Coretta next to him as a way of presenting him as a good christian family man. <br>
Coretta looked a lot like Jackie&hellip;&#8221; #17</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Interesting post. But Corretta &#8220;beautiful&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll acknowledge that MLK caught himself a  high class &#8220;high yeller&#8221;, which he (and his handlers) obviously considered a prize. And Coretta did have a lot more poise and class than MLK ever did or could. </p>
<p>She was better looking than MLK, for sure, but I never considered Coretta &#8220;beautiful&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s over-stating it. And in no way was she  another Jackie.</p>

		<p>Carolyn K is just playing up to the lefties. The Kennedys had a lot of reasons to hate Hoover and Hoover himself hated the Kannedys. I remember reading somewhere that Hoover threatened to blow the whistle over JFK&rsquo;s affair with Marilyn Monroe if the President didn&rsquo;t knock off with the philandering and she winds up dead not too long after that. Apparently Hoover saw JFK&rsquo;s affairs as a disgrace to the Presidency. Maybe Hoover had some dirt on the Kenndys and he used the Monroe threat to intimidate JFK and RFK. We may never know. The media,over the years, have tried to claim that Hoover was gay. What is certain is that Jackie wasn&rsquo;t reacting out of extreme grief,as the leftist media has tried to suggest, she did share an intimate though rocky relationship with the President and must have been privy to a lot of inside information. One wonders what revelations that mini series was going to make that made it so important for the President&rsquo;s daughter to want to squelch it.     </p>

		<p>What strikes me about this is that it is a classic early example of LIMOUSINE LIBERALISM.  It was fine, when MLK was ruining the lives of ordinary whites.  In that case, King was wonderful and noble.  But the second he turned his poison upon the Limousine Liberals themselves, he became &#8220;That Awful Man&#8221;.</p>
<p>Such wealthy cheats always want &#8216;diversity&rsquo; to wreck the schools and neighborhoods and lives of ordinary whites (particularly Protestants).  But the Liberals&rsquo; pet creatures of color (basically, their Dogs of War) had better toe the line when around their Limousine Liberal Masters.</p>
<p>What would be the Limousine Liberal Motto?  Do unto THEM, but not unto US!&#8221; ?</p>
<p>Funny: I grew up in Greenville, Mississippi, at a time when Forced Integration had destroyed the excellent public schools, but before people started moving away.  I&rsquo;m just old enough to remember several families we knew, who had limousines for ferrying their kids to private schools.  Rather a thrill, when I got to carpool to First Grade in one. Generally, someone&rsquo;s Maid or Mom drove.  I only remember one real Chauffeur.</p>
<p>I know of three &#8216;diplomatic&rsquo; cars, though: an Imperial Ghia and two Lehmann-Peterson stretch Continentals (I&rsquo;ve seen photos of Kennedys at outdoor gatherings, sitting in identical cars&hellip;doors open&hellip;gabbing on phones&hellip;acting the Big Shot), which were sent down from DC, after doing &#8216;diplomatic duty&rsquo;.  I expect the Cadillac Limmies had more mundane origins.  Our town had several families who had fashioned golden parachutes in the Integration Industry&hellip;.ways out of the South, and into Eastern Seaboard prominence&hellip;fashioned their golden parachutes gaining fame selling out and demonizing white Southerners.  </p>
<p>I remember the &#8216;right set&rsquo;, the Private School Set, the Summer House in Maine Set, making fun of &#8216;racist Rednecks&rsquo;, &#8216;Holy Rollers&rsquo;&hellip;. the lesser folk.  I don&rsquo;t know whether the owners of the gargantuan cars in which we used to carpool were true Limousine Liberals.  But I&rsquo;ve had a glimpse into that world, and can imagine the consternation of &#8216;Jackie&rsquo;, that one of her family&rsquo;s little &#8216;pets&rsquo; might turn and bite his masters.</p>

		<p>Jackie&rsquo;s reaction to MLK was probably due to her revulsion at the open and depraved sexual escapades that he and his entourage lustfully engaged in when they converged on conservative Southern towns for one of their demonstrations.  This is probably some of the information that Hoover was passing on to the Kennedy&rsquo;s.  This has always been well known about MLK, but has been kept under wraps by the MSM because MLK is a &#8220;black saint&#8221; to so many including some whites.  It&rsquo;s very similar to what the liberal MSM is doing now with Obama.  I&rsquo;m still one of those who believes his birth certificate is a fraud and that he&rsquo;s not eligible to be POTUS.  World Net Daily just posted an article today regarding Obama&rsquo;s social security number.  Seems it doesn&rsquo;t pass e-verify.  Why am I not surprised?</p>

		<p>King was a lying, hypocritical, oversexed communist. The Kennedys were over-privileged, liberal, oversexed do-gooders intent on destroying the nation. Hoover was a closet queer, and a blackmailer with delusions of grandeur. Box them all up together and with a dollar added you can buy a cup of bad coffee. All of them together are a microcosim of what&rsquo;s wrong with America.   </p>

Years ago I read, &#8220;Kennedy was the promise of what the sixties could have been. Nixon was the terrible reality of what they became.&#8221; <br>
 <br>
The real John Kennedy was a Cold Warrior who authorized CIA efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro. The real John Kennedy threatened nuclear war when the Russians put missiles in Cuba, even though the Russians had the right to do so under international law, even though we already had missiles in Turkey that were equally threatening to Russia, and even though intercontinental ballistic missiles soon made the missiles in Cuba obsolete. <br>
 <br>
The real John Kennedy was irritated by the civil rights movement because segregationists beating up non violent demonstrators made the United States look bad during the Cold War when it was feared that newly independent Africa would somehow &#8220;go Communist.&#8221; John&rsquo;s attitudes influenced Jacqueline.  </p>

Jackie Kennedy was more than a little schizy and came to consciously adopt a semi-unpressured &#8220;coooy&#8221; speech, etc.,  In the eyes of her social peers, she had  a dreamy notion of what reality was.  Nonetheless, she seems to have perceived that King was not large enough for the &#8220;costumes&#8221; draped over him by the media and other political forces. </p>

&ldquo;Many thought MLK was selected because of his and his wife&rsquo;s youth. MLK was fat and ugly. Wife Coretta was beautiful Most of the pictures of MLK had beautiful Coretta next to him as a way of presenting him as a good christian family man. <br>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Interesting post. But Corretta &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll acknowledge that MLK caught himself a high class &ldquo;high yeller&rdquo;, which he (and his handlers) obviously considered a prize. And Coretta did have a lot more poise and class than MLK ever did or could. </p>
<p>She was better looking than MLK, for sure, but I never considered Coretta &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s over-stating it. And in no way was she another Jackie.</p>

<p>Lee was her maternal grandfather.  Great grandfather Lee was an Irish immigrant who arrived in New York around 1870. He ws one of those immigrant success stories.  Became a Dr. and school teacher.  Then became superintendent of the entire New York State public school system.</p>

		<p>I have always thought that the assasination of MLK was arranged by the Russians.</p>
<p>It was right out of their revolutionary manuals.  Create a hero then murder him and blame it on the non communist opposistion.<br>
Then there is a hero for the useful idiots to worship.</p>
<p>MLK did his work for the communists.  The civil rights act of 1965 was passed.  The civil rights plus affirmative action act of 1968 was well on its way to passing.  The EEOC had been created and made discrimination against Whites the norm and legal.</p>
<p>MLK did the work the CPUSA wanted.  What to do with him now?  Killing him gave the blacks a King Arthur King David Charlemagne figure.  Killing him made all Whites look bad.  With a little help from the anti American media, killing him made the rest of the world look on America as a dangerous, violent racist mess instead of the leader of the free world.</p>
<p>Killing him fit exactly into the communist agenda.  </p>

<p>There is a lot more information about MLK&rsquo;s communist backers and aides than is contained in the Atlantic Monthly&rsquo;s article 40 years later.  </p>
<p>For instance, his and Rosa Park&rsquo;s training at the communist Highlander Training school, the Rosenwald foundation, the Quaker (who created Angela Davis BTW)connection with MLK, NAACP records of NAACP blacks fighting against NAACP communist Whites and on and on.</p>

<p>A big portion of it did, but Joe Kennedy made a lot of money &#8220;above board&#8221; (at least in 1920s parlance) through shady stock deals.  Ironically, he was FDR&rsquo;s first chairman of the New Deal-established Securities and Exchange Commission, and he partially helped make those sorts of acts illegal.</p>

		<p>Fender #71: So Communism wasn&rsquo;t that bad? Ten million Ukranians were starved to death by that maniac, Stalin, who murdered 65 million people, until is own belated death.</p>
<p>Mao murdered 77 million, and I haven&rsquo;t even added in Castro, Pol Pot, Kim Jung Il, and the rest of the sadistic murderers that were propped up by the Communist Kremlin. </p>
<p>Also, the Red Menace gave us Mugabe in what used to be White Rhodesia, and Mandella, and his ANC Communist murderers, in what used to be First World White Boer South Africa. Now both former White Countries are hell-holes, and Whites are murdererd every day there. </p>
<p>Free Markets didn&rsquo;t vote Barry into Office, or change our Social landscape. It was the Corporate-Socialists, like Homo Depot, Sears, Wal-Mart, and other large Corporate enteties that can give you low prices because they crush all competition around them, partciularly the old Mom and Pop Stores, and then pay the people that apply for work at one of these Slave Mills, minimum wages, and no benefits at all. </p>
<p>I find it ironic that those who champion Socialism, and &#8220;Social Justice&#8221; like Wal-Mart, will not allow the formation of Unions in their own Stores. Now, if that&rsquo;s not hypocritical, I don&rsquo;t know what is. </p>
<p>Also, remember that the Russians never wanted non-White foreigners in Russia, and still don&rsquo;t today, as they have a large anti-Foreigner Skinhead Movement there. </p>
<p>But we are talking about the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Cold War enemies, and what better way to turn a Western Nation on its head than by having blacks in America protest for their &#8220;Rights&#8221;, as which also happened in former Colonies all over Africa, regarding their former Western European rulers? </p>
<p>If America and Western Europe could be villified by Native black Communists in America, and Africa, then maybe those Communist movements would grow, and a Red Revolution would take place in those lands? </p>
<p>You have to think like your enemy to outsmart him, and this is what the Communists were doing. They didn&rsquo;t want it in Russia, but in America, black rule was just fine. </p>

<p>I agree that arguing over whether Coretta was very or average good looking is a waste of time. It is not a waste of time however, to point out that MLK was a communist front man.  The entire history of the NAACP was a history of non communist blacks fighting communist Whites and blacks within the organization for control.The communists won and MLK became a saint.</p>
<p>The communists have used the blacks and other non Whites to bury us.  Google Colward Priven Alinsky Frank Marshall Davis, CPUSA and civil rights etc for more information.</p>
<p>Granted knowing just who was behind the civil rights movement, black on White crime and affirmative action really does not help us now.  But knowing how the White reds and their black stormtroopers have operated for the last 100 years might help in the future.  </p>
<p>It did not prevent Obama who was raised by communist grandparents from becoming President.  It might prevent his re-election, although I personally think that between commie front ACORN and the Democrats stranglehold on the electoral commissions of the big states he will win again.</p>

<p>We Whites have many legitimate reasons for resenting and opposing the so-called Civil Rights movement:   The Civil Rights movement was not about equal rights; it was about black supremacy over Whites, about degrading and displacing Whites, about granting blacks rights over and above Whites, about taking rights away   &mdash;   from Whites.  </p>
<p>MLK was a fake, fraud and front man in the War on Whites.  Those who supported and funded him stayed in the background lest their Communist affiliations and sinister plans come to light.  </p>
<p>We Whites resent being forced to bow down to a phony, fraud and plastic god while our Founding Fathers becoming increasingly marginalized, vilified, forgotten and relegated to the ash heap.  MLK has his own holiday while Lincoln and Washington have been rolled into the all-purpose, generic &#8220;President&rsquo;s Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Act ushered in the era of massive anti-White discrimination, known as affirmative action and forced racial integration of the schools, transforming the public education system from First World excellence to sinking morass.</p>
<p><i>Also your anti-commie this and that makes me think of things in that era when I was a kid.</i></p>
<p>There are only three possible political and economic conditions: liberty, tyranny or chaos.</p>
<p>Communism, or tyranny, is the government dictating to you what you will do and what you will not do, what you can say and what you cannot say.  Those who don&rsquo;t agree with the government&rsquo;s plan are neutralized with a 10 cent bullet to the back of the head.</p>
<p>Is it worth fighting against the imposition of tyranny?  62-65 million dead in the Soviet Union at the hands of the government prove that it is.</p>

<p> I wish we poor Southerners had a Communist party back in the 1800s. They would have made the plantation owners,the feudal lords employ whites instead of profiteering off black families by breeding or importing them.</p>
<p> If Uncle Abe hadn&rsquo;t stopped this practice when he did,the Slavocrats would have had this country 50% black now instead of 13%. They were essentially like South African industrialists, Capitalism and ideology above all, Race and culture be damned.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed that the USSR was behind the killing of King in the hope that it would incite a firestorm across America by the black population. Ray kept quiet as he knew full well that he would be murdered in prison if he told anything about his backers. </p>

		<p>The Dems cannot continue to claim their JFK legacy and King at the same time. I&rsquo;m not surprised by these &lsquo;new&rsquo; revelations concerning King. This guy has been given a status above every single American historical figure for far too long. All the named schools and streets, the national holiday, the uncritical and fawning praise taught in public schools all serves to advance the groupthink and worship of a Leftist hero.</p>
<p>He seems to have lead a personal life wholly inconsistent with his professed Christian teachings. And, much more disturbingly, he had communist tendencies which are at the heart of black liberation theology, and social and economic justice policies which are currently seriously dividing our nation along lines of race and income.</p>
<p>So, the next time I see a flash mob destroying property and beating &lsquo;Whitey&rsquo;, I can know that King would have approved.</p>

The tapes were sealed on request of King&rsquo;s wife, a Commie herself, until 2027 because the horrific acts will finally be told. Knock that Stalin-esque statue down and stop celebrating his birthday! </p>

Do you have any evidence that Martin Luther King jr. raped young girls? It is one thing to engage in infidelity but to accuse someone of being a rapist young girls is going a bit far.</p>

<p>About that, I can buy the official story only up to a point.  I can believe that someone who broke out of Jefferson City was able to subsist on the proceeds from armed robberies and burglaries for almost a year, and that this particular someone was able to assassinate MLK in the way that he did on his own.</p>
<p>But where it all goes wrong in my mind is this:  In 1968, any air travel was expensive.  Much less spur of the moment air travel, much less international air travel.  You had to have a lot of money in order to do what Ray did, fly on the spur of a moment from Toronto or Montreal (can&rsquo;t remember which) to London, then down to Portugal, then back to London, then being able to buy a ticket from London to Rhodesia, except he was made and arrested before he could take that flight.</p>
<p>No way you can afford that from almost a year of nickel and dime robberies and burglaries.</p>

		<p>The main thing that leads me to believe the Russians were behind MLK&rsquo;s death is this.  If the evil southern segregationists used Ray to kill MLK why on earth did they wait so long?</p>
<p>Why wait until all his goals had been achieved?  Why didn&rsquo;t they kill him back in 1956 when he first became leader of the desegregation  crusade?</p>
<p>The Russians waited until his goals were achieved.  Then they made him a martyr.</p>

To my knowlwedge, there was no evidence that either President Kennedy, his brother or Martin Luther King jr,. were rapists. Philanderers. Yes, but rapists? </p>
<p>Please provide this information on either King, the Kennedey brothers or both. This would be explosive.</p>

		<p>   I grew up in the 50s and 60s believing J. Edgar Hoover was more or less a role model at the very least and a hero . How easy it is to disparage someone after they are dead and gone but one thing is for certain, JEH never had a 9-11 on his watch . There should have been some heads rolling at the FBI and the CIA after 9-11, strangely there weren&rsquo;t .</p>
<p>   JEH didn&rsquo;t have to lie about the MLK and the civil rights movement . MLK was a known philanderer, a communist sympathizer and had communist support at a time when America was willing to sacrifice nearly 100,000 Americans in two Asian wars fighting communism . </p>
<p>   On the whole these things are quite common within the African-American community .The NAACP was collapsing of it&rsquo;s own corruption, that&rsquo;s why Mfume had to take the reins in the early nineties .</p>
<p>   Sorry&hellip;J. Edgar still gets my vote . Poor young Kennedy, like so many of our youth has been completely brainwashed by the left and she can no longer see the forest for the trees .    </p>

Are you serious? The Russians were behind King&rsquo;s death? This makes no sense to me.</p>
