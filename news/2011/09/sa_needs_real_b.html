			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ntsakisi Maswanganyi, Business Live, September 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>SA still needs to produce &#8220;authentic&#8221; black entrepreneurs who &#8220;truly&#8221; own the means of production, according to President Jacob Zuma during his address at the Black Business Summit on Tuesday.</p>
<p>SA still had &#8220;no visible&#8221; black industrialists, despite the many black people entering various sectors of the economy, Zuma said. </p>
<p>&#8220;You cannot have political power without economic power,&#8221; Zuma told the summit, adding &#8220;we do not see large factories that are owned by black people or women.&#8221; </p>
<p>Government would help through the provision of industrial funding as well as through its preferential procurement policies, the president noted. </p>
<p>Zuma urged the summit to produce pointers as to how business, both emerging and established, would contribute to building a new industrial sector. </p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s economic empowerment tool, Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment, had not yet benefited a wide enough segment of society, Zuma conceded. </p>
<p>&#8220;We want to see a much stronger focus on the broad-based aspects of BEE,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Government expected the new procurement regulations, which would come into effect in December 2011, to contribute to improving the economic participation of black businesses. </p>
<p>While Zuma called for more black participation in the economy, he also noted problems within SA&rsquo;s business space. </p>
<p>The summit came after the recent termination of membership by the Black Management Forum (BMF) from the country&rsquo;s largest business advocacy group Business Unity SA (Busa). </p>
<p>Organisers of the summit, the Confederation of Black Business Organisations, said the event would map out a way forward regarding whether or not other black business would also follow the BMF and terminate their membership at Busa. </p>
<p>During its termination of the Busa membership, the BMF accused Busa of marginalising black business and not taking transformation seriously. </p>
<p>The summit was taking place during a period of uncertainty with regards to business unity, Zuma said. </p>
<p>Zuma told the summit that government needed a unified and united business voice to work with. </p>
<p>&#8220;We therefore urge you, in your deliberations, to discuss the matter thoroughly with a view to finding solutions,&#8221; Zuma said. </p>
<p>&#8220;As government our objective is to see unity in order to focus on the economic growth and development priorities that face the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zuma announced that he would also meet with Busa soon. </p>
<p>&#8220;You now know what needs to be done. Unity must prevail here first for it to prevail elsewhere,&#8221; he told the delegates. </p>
<p>A concern for government was that the social and economic aspects of transformation were still lagging behind in the country, Zuma said. </p>
<p>Government was also worried about ownership, he said. The ownership and management of the economy in particular, Zuma noted, had not changed considerably since the dawn of freedom. </p>
<p>The conference&rsquo;s discussions were held behind closed doors. Resolutions would be made public at a briefing on Wednesday. </p>

		<p>Blacks are by far the least capable of successfully operating buisnesses,just like they are the most capable athletes,entertainers, and musicians.This unfortunate fact was pointed out in the black journalist Tony Browns book Black Lies and White Lies.They actually boycott black run buisnesses.Why? because non black buisnesses have lower average prices, are open more of the time, and have better merchandise.</p>

<p>Perhaps Pres Zuma could set an example by protecting the white farmers and establish a forum where they could transfer their skills to blacks.</p>
<p>He could then hit the big time and assist blacks to set up factories manufacturing pins, paper clips and wire coat hangers. </p>

		<p>#1 Peejay - I most vehemently disagree that blacks &#8220;are the most capable athletes,entertainers, and musicians.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s more to athletics than running and jumping; entertainment has an aesthetic component that is the antithesis of the ugliness that blacks bring; and so-called black music is not music at all, but crap.</p>
<p>There is nothing that blacks have contributed to society that is positive.  Nothing that we would not be better off without.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;we do not see large factories that are owned by black people or women.&rdquo; </p>
<p>-  Such places are not created out of thin air.  Liberals and leftists and &#8216;social justice&rsquo; activists never understand this.  It takes </p>
<p>a) people with vision to inititate such a thing.<br>
b) Lots of negotiation and planning and investments<br>
c) a lot of egg-head analysis<br>
d) building alliances across many interested parties<br>
e) patience, because it could take years to get a big thing going<br>
f) forethought about how to solve problems</p>
<p>And so many other intangibles.  Most businesses started by WHITE people eventually fail.  Why should blacks have a magical juju in this vein?</p>
<p>What will happen in SA?  Eventually they will nationalize the resouces industries and confiscate the farms, even though white claims to the land predate the arrival of the Zulus and so many others, who also migrated to the area.  Then the place will fail, and the CHINESE will be brought in to run things, and the SA nation will really be cheated blind!</p>

		<p>It is just a shakedown to make white businesses find some black skinned guy to put in a suit and give him a fancy title and a large paycheck to be a co-owner or executive.</p>

		<p>Just a matter of time before there will be a major famine in South Africa. Farms that used to export products will be lying fallow. Bush meat will only last until most of the wild animal population is wiped out and the world will have another African country asking for aid.</p>

<p>As a lifelong musician,  I have to tell you that statement is not merely vastly overblown, but dead wrong.<br>
If I even began to cite the history of music, and it&rsquo;s relevance to your statement, this website would crash.</p>

		<p>Ayn Rand at her most brilliant would not have been able to forsee what is currently happening in SA. See if you can grasp this :</p>
<p>You are an 18y/o white male leaving school. You have a huge disadvantage getting into university ( which was built with the sweat of your own race&rsquo;s forefathers - but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day ). Whereas non-whites get a lot of breaks, you have to pay for absolutely everything, as your money helps keep the already advantaged non-white students. If/when you graduate, your chances of a job are minimal, as most jobs come with the whites-need-not-apply tag.</p>
<p>So you decide to start your own enterprise. Even while you are registering the new-born company, the registrar wants to know from you what you will be doing with regards to Black Empowerment ( i.e. you kick off as a slave ). Let&rsquo;s assume that you overcome the obstacles, and you successfully get your company off the ground, you are told who to employ - based on skin colour, with absolutely no regard for competence or qualification.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve managed to get the company up and running, the law determines that you MUST share the company with blacks - that pretty much entails that you are forced to donate a share of your company to a black/s. Once you&rsquo;ve overcome that little obstacle, you will be told that because you were advantaged by Apartheid, you will be taxed at a higher rate than a black entrepeneur ( not that there are any, but you get the gist ).</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s assume that despite all of the above you still make it big, and you manage to become wealthy, the unions will tell your employees that you are only rich because you have been exploiting them - i.e you become one of the hated &#8220;rich&#8221;, and thus will be forced to pay outrageous &#8220;living wages&#8221; - again irrespective of productivity. If you should want to get rid of any problem employee, the CCMA will be on your back, and you&rsquo;ll be forced to pay a settlement amount to this dead duck.</p>
<p>And then on top of all this, Whites still rule the boardrooms, are still the vast majority of business owners, and still pay approx 70% of the country&rsquo;s taxes, even though we make up around 9% of the population.</p>
<p>Need seriously tough mo&rsquo;fo&rsquo;s to work for you ?? Come look among the Afrikaners of South Africa. The irony is that this very same situation exists in nearly all of the neighbouring &#8220;independant&#8221; countries as well.</p>
<p>If the Whites of SA had to go on strike or withhold their taxes for just one month, the entire ANC house of cards would come crumbling down. In in spite of that we are being killed, raped, robbed, despised, vilified, demonised and blamed for everything that is wrong in country.</p>
<p>White America and Europe - take heed. You&rsquo;re next.</p>
