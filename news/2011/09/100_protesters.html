			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Protesters set fire to the U.S. flag outside the American embassy in London yesterday during a minute&rsquo;s silence to mark the moment the first hijacked airliner hit the World Trade Centre.</p>
<p>A group of 100 Muslim radicals, including members of Muslims Against Crusades, shouted &#8216;USA  terrorists&rsquo; and brandished anti-American placards.</p>
<p>One protester in Grosvenor Square said: &#8216;You will always face suffering, you will always face humiliation, unless you withdraw your troops from Muslim lands.&rsquo;</p>
<p><br>
<img alt="Muslims.jpg" src="/news/2011/09/12/Muslims.jpg" width="634" height="445" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>
<p><br>
A small group of Muslims staged a counter-demonstration nearby, holding up placards reading &#8216;Muslims Against Extremism&rsquo; and &#8216;If You Want Sharia, Move To Saudi&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Abdul Sallam, 41, who was waving a sign that read &#8216;Keep The Silence&rsquo;, travelled down to London from his home in Glasgow to show the strength of his feelings.</p>
<p>He said: &#8216;I&rsquo;m a Muslim. What they&rsquo;re doing is bringing shame on all Muslims.This is not part of the teachings of Islam.</p>
<p>&#8216;Islam is all about peace, but what they want to do is hate other people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Islam teaches you that when you see anything bad or evil, you should speak out against it.</p>
<p>&#8216;If the moderate Muslims all came out and spoke out, that would defeat them.</p>
<p>&#8216;I am proud to be British. I love my country. All these people are doing is breaking Britain apart.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earlier, a group of English Defence League protesters were ordered to move on to accommodate the anti-American demonstration.</p>
<p>The 60-strong group briefly scuffled with police as they were forced away from their original location to a different part of Grosvenor Square.</p>
<p>Twenty people were arrested for breach of the peace as the group was dispersed towards Oxford Street.</p>
<p>And at least four more arrests were made as police escorted the Muslim group back towards the Central London Mosque in Regents Park.</p>
<p><br>
<img alt="EDL.jpg" src="/news/2011/09/12/EDL.jpg" width="634" height="509" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><div style="text-align: center;">Police and EDL members.</div></p>
<p><br>
One of the guests at the Grosvenor Square memorial service said the protesters should be stopped from standing just across the road from the embassy and using a loud megaphone.</p>
<p>The man, whose cousin died in the terror attacks, added: &#8216;They shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to do it. It&rsquo;s very disrespectful. It&rsquo;s too loud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &#8216;They can say what they want but not with the loudspeaker. They shouldn&rsquo;t obstruct the service.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The one sign says &#8220;Islam Will Dominate the World&#8221;, and ethnic Brits are banned from stopping Muslims, who have no business living in London in the first place, from holding up such signs during a moment to honor the dead.</p>
<p>The pictures tell the story, and a sad and anger-provoking story it is.</p>

		<p>Americans must beware that modern Britain has an absolutely enormous muslim population (most of who hail from Pakistan).<br>
  It is imdeed highly likely that Pakistanis will outnumber indigenous Britons sometime this century.<br>
  You must readjust your notions of Briatin.it is no longer a country full of Roger Moores or David Nivens, of cream teas, bowler hats etc.<br>
  Alsp you must be very careful in screening &#8216;tourists&rsquo; from Britain.It is likely there&rsquo;s nothing British about them at all.</p>

		<p>These images remind me of something we would expect outside an embassy in Yemen or Pakistan. Truly shocking, and sickening, to all patriotic Americans. </p>
<p>But hey, isn&rsquo;t what they did a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;? There have been arrests before, I have heard, of English Trotskyites being arrested for burning American flags. As Americans are a &#8220;racial or ethnic minority&#8221; in Britain, it was counted as &#8220;incitement to racial or ethnic hatred&#8221;. </p>
<p>The Union Jack is in Britain, from my understanding, the only national flag one is allowed to burn freely. </p>
<p>Of course, the odds that Dhimmi Regime would charge them with a hate crime is very low. </p>

		<p>Well, these hateful Muslims aren&rsquo;t a very pretty sight - but they aren&rsquo;t saying anything that senile Ron Paul didn&rsquo;t say on the 10th anniversary of 9/11/01:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all America&rsquo;s fault - we deserved the 9/11/01 mass murder of our people in our country, Muslims only threaten and harm people when they have just causes, &#8220;root causes&#8221; like seeing Western women show their arms and ankles. And we should cancel the Winter Olympics because Pakistani Muslims are offended that Muslims aren&rsquo;t winning any medals&hellip; and Texans and Green Bay Packer fans need to stop drinking beer, because this offends the Muslims, because Muslims are clean, straight living people of the one true faith&hellip; of course they use the back of their hands for toilet paper and they&rsquo;re main export is opium/heroin - but we Western people can&rsquo;t have a beer.</p>
<p>So remember</p>
<p>DON&rsquo;T OFFEND THE MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS<br>
ISLAM IS A RELIGION OF PEACE</p>
<p>And if anyone says Islam isn&rsquo;t a religion of peace than violent Muslims will try to cut off your head and it will all be our fault </p>
<p>Ron Paul says so.</p>

		<p>Who cares what flag they burn? Years ago, this would tick me off, but not now. </p>
<p>You have to remember, that flag doesn&rsquo;t represent us, anymore.  </p>
<p>So, if you want to fly a flag in front of your home, try a Gadsden flag, a Confederate flag, a Betsy Ross Colonial American flag, or a Spirit of &#8216;76 American flag.</p>
<p>I would also recommend an American flag with the number 93 on the field of blue, to honor those who died on September 11th. </p>
