<h1>Corruption, Racial Discrimination as Construction Gangs Steal Millions in Texas </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Groogan, My Fox Latino, September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>These days, it&rsquo;s just something you rarely, if ever, see: African-Americans laboring within the largely Hispanic construction crews working the Gulf Coast&rsquo;s heavy industrial projects.</p>
<p>Ricardo Charles says he knows exactly why and after 33 years in the building trade, he&rsquo;s blowing the whistle.</p>
<p><strong>Black and White</strong></p>
<p>Charles says those who run organized, largely Hispanic crews almost never hire willing African-American laborers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no, blacks they are out of the question. Blacks are out of the question. Nobody wants a black person in there,&#8221; Charles insisted, a Mexican-American man.</p>
<p>The practice of rejecting black labor is deeply entrenched discrimination which extends to white workers as well, Charles says.</p>
<p>These men and women are effectively cut off from decent-paying construction jobs by secretive Mexican labor gangs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are afraid that white people are not going to put up with their unethical acts,&#8221; Charles explained.</p>
<p><strong>The Mordida</strong></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s talking about bribes. They call it &#8220;Mordida&#8221; in Mexico, the bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is actually just like in Mexico. It&rsquo;s not how much you know, it&rsquo;s who you know,&#8221; Charles said.</p>
<p>For years, on nearly every major industrial construction site in Texas, workers have been quietly forced to pay the leaders of Mexican labor gangs hundreds of dollars up front just to obtain a job.</p>
<p>With each weekly pay-check, the kick backs from workers to gang leaders continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not only how much you pay to go in. You pay anything from $50 to $70 a week while you are in the project,&#8221; Charles insisted.</p>

		<p>Speaking of heavy industrial projects, they`re now being put together by unskilled labor who can`t even assemble a garden shed properly&hellip; Two examples, one a multi-level parking garage in San Antonio Texas that collapsed and that new City Centre Hotel in Las Vegas which had such a leaning Tower of Pisa thing going on it couldn`t be completed. They wanted to put condos on top of the hotel but since it was so unstable they couldn`t, and now they want to tear the whole thing down because it`s no longer financially viable&hellip; </p>

		<p>You mean they are finally getting around to giving media attention to this practice? This has been going on for decades. In agriculture also. In CA, you can NEVER obtain employment in the ag business if you are White. Mexican business owners will NEVER hire anyone but mexicans. The same with black and Asian businesses hiring only blacks and Asians. Whites can NEVER get away with this blatant discrimination. I wish we could! We were once FREE to discriminate and life was so much better in America. I sure do miss those days.</p>

		<p>Anonymous #1 reminded me of something by talking about the shoddy buildings that we build in San Antonio and Las Vegas&hellip;we&rsquo;re living in a real-life Idiocracy type world. Sometimes i think it&rsquo;d be best if, as whites, we just let the current garbage pile of faltering &#8220;nation&#8221; collapse in on itself and start again instead of trying to repair the broken foundations of this nation.</p>

		<p>It would be better to buy one of those manufactured homes than buy a house built by unskilled hispanic indian labor and crooked russian, armenian, persian, israeli, and arab contractors.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable what junk the combination of crooked White immigrants and stone age indians are putting up in California.</p>
<p>The county recently built a new animal control facility near me.  I went by it every day.  I saw not one worker who was not some sort of 4ft8 indian.</p>

		<p>Blacks will not hire whites either for the same exact reason.  They fear whites will not go along with their unethical, corrupt, criminal and mostly incompetent behavior.  I have a friend who, after retiring honorably from the military, applied for a position with several police forces including Baltimore City, Baltimore County and the MD. State Police.  He was accepted by all except Baltimore City which is run by africans.  For whatever reason, I think proximity, he preferred Baltimore City and was initially dismayed that he had been accepted by the others and not BCPD.  When he queried as to why he had been rejected they told him that they could not officially say why but that he could submit a request for more information if he so desired.  He didnt bother, he figured it out and took a position with Baltimore County PD.</p>

		<p>anywhere hispanics get power they only hire Mexicans and they only serve mexican.  I went to a Calif state office for help when injured on the job and the entire office was Mexican  I was quickly told they would not help a white man to make up for past discrimination.  White men were thrown out and young white women were asked for a date.  I left Calif and set up in the northwoods</p>

		<p>In the past,  Hollywood liberals would have made a screenplay out of this. They would have changed the races around so that the whites would be in charge of the evil gangs, and blacks and Mexicans would be the victims. The blacks and Mexicans would unite in brotherhood against the evil whites and peacefully overcome this corruption, holding hands, chanting, and marching down the street MLK style. The evil white boss would be standing next to the evil white sheriff, filled with anger, but ultimately defeated. What a heartwarming story that would be. </p>
<p>If this were still the 70s, they could cast Sorell Brook as the evil boss. He played Boss Hogg on the Dukes of Hazzard, that would be a good choice. Jackie Gleason could  be wheeled in to play Sheriff Bufford T Justice. The handsome Erik Estrada could be the heroic Mexican labor union leader (even though he is not Mexican). </p>
<p>Hollywood liberals are nostalgic for the day when they could distort reality without question or resistance. The problem is that we have the internet now. </p>

<p>Is Taylor deliberately trying to paint them as white to confuse the issue? Afterall real hispanics and latinos are white not red. </p>
<p>We know Taylor loves his yellow mongoloids so obviously he like their other half reds just as good.</p>
<p>Mongoloid red yellows are all the same. </p>

		<p>If you have any work done on your home, tell the Business Owner up front that you will only do business with him if he uses American workers. </p>
<p>Tell him, when they arrive, that they all better have valid IDs, like State Driver&rsquo;s Licenses, US Passports, or a Birth Certificate. No papers, no job. </p>
<p>Also, all Workers must speak English, and all work being done, must be in English, only. As the Homeowner, you want to know what they are saying around you and your family, to ensure the are not casing your home, and making plans to commit a burglary, or Home Invasion at some other time. </p>

		<p>Nationalist conservatives care more about securing our own borders than securing the borders of other countries. They are against handouts for illegal aliens. They want a wall built along the Mexican border to stop illegal aliens and gangs. They&rsquo;re against amnesty, oppose birthright citizenship, and believe illegal aliens should be deported, not coddled. They believe jobs should go to Americans first, and not to illegal aliens. They may not be AR readers yet, but they have a growing sense that something has gone badly wrong with their country.<br>

<p>Speaking Spanish won&rsquo;t help at all. Changing their last names to Spanish names will.  A mediocore White IQ and a Spanish last name ensures a free ride to a prestige college and dozens of job offers junior year.</p>
<p>Speaking fluent Spanish and a non Spanish last name ensures that the application goes straight into the trash.  Employers recruit only minorities from the colleges.</p>

<p>Do you ever look at the hispanics?  Of course they are not White hispanics. The real White hispanics stay in Mexico because they are the multi millionaires who run the country.</p>
<p>Most of those construction workers are 100 percent indians from stone age villages who have never seen electricity or indoor plumbing till they are told to build it here in America.</p>

Ditto for Florida.  We have had this issue since the Cubans arrived in the early 1960s.  First they were just happy to have escaped Castro then as the numbers increased and wealth with it, their businesses were closed off to whites.  First the simple worker jobs then the circle included suppliers, then county and city workers they had business contacts with.  As whites no longer could find work, they left Miami and then South Florida.  As the Cuban presence rose, other South and Central Americans came because they didn&rsquo;t need to speak English and they would get the lowest tiers of jobs the rich Cubans didn&rsquo;t want.  Now over half of Florida really isn&rsquo;t America any longer and I suppose never will be, short of a civil war.  Crime, corruption, Banana Republic style is the theme of South Florida.  Those of us that spent the paradise years in South Florida, 40s, 50s and early 60s are dying out, moved away and now the history, the life of another part of the United States is gone.  I would fight, I would sacrifice to return what is ours if we had a chance, if we could organize a united front but alas, white people seemed resigned to this slow death.</p>

<p>Tomatoland: How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed Our Most Alluring Fruit, Barry Estabrook writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;As a United States attorney for Florida&rsquo;s Middle District based in Fort Myers, Douglas Molloy has had more than a decade of experience dealing with crime in Immokalee. </p>
<p>More specifically, Molloy, who is in his early fifties and has wavy salt-and-pepper hair and a deeply lined face, has gained an international reputation by specializing in prosecuting an act that was supposed to have vanished from the United States 1 45 years ago. </p>
<p>At any given time, Molloy works on six to twelve slavery cases. Immokalee, he says, is &#8216;ground zero for modern-day slavery. &rsquo; He also says that any American who has eaten a winter tomato, either purchased at a supermarket or on top of a fast food salad, has eaten a fruit picked by the hand of a slave. &#8216;That&rsquo;s not an assumption,&rsquo; he told me. &#8216;That is a fact.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Both slaves and slavemasters are immigrants, mostly illegal  &mdash;  the example he gives is an illegal Guatemalan victimized by a Mexican.</p>
<p>Immigration enforcemt could free the slaves (and send them back to their home countries) but it&rsquo;s blocked by the National Council of La Raza, the NAACP&hellip;and the growers. You know, the people we have called &#8220;the New Slave Power&#8221;?</p>
<p>/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////</p>
<p>Italian immigrants pulled this in the 19th century.  Gangmasters controlled groups of laborers whose parents sold them to the gangmasters back in Italy.  They were brought to America.  The employers did not pay the workers directly, they paid the gangmaster who was supposed to pay the workers.</p>
<p>In the 1880&rsquo;s the federal goverment enacted some strict anti contract labor indentured servitude laws.  Every immigrant who went through Ellis Island was questioned as to his contract laborer status. When contract laborers and their escorts/guards were discovered the whole crew was sent back to Italy.  </p>
<p>That law is still on the books.  But of course we don&rsquo;t enforce any of our immigration laws any more.</p>

		<p>If you want to save the USA you must send all mexicans and blacks and asians and all non-europeans back to their resepective countries and financialy compensate them for having to do so. </p>
<p>There is absolutely no other way. Fullstop, line underneath.</p>
<p>I know the stats and I can tell you now, if the last banker bail-out could have more than adequately paid for this repatriation, (I think I&rsquo;m over-extending this requirement, $ wise) we can and will have to do it. </p>
<p>It will cause massive civil unrest as the 3rd worlders are repatriated, but the money will help to ease this transition. I would rather our tax paying money was spent not in bailing out massive financial scams, pyramid huscksters and plain and simple greedy bastards, as saving a place that is sacrosanct for white survival and identity.</p>
<p>Which bill would you rather pay?</p>
<p>White tax payers for the most part generated this money, so why can&rsquo;t we spend it in our national interest when we need to?</p>

		<p>#7 &#8220;It would be better to buy one of those manufactured homes than buy a house built by unskilled hispanic indian labor and crooked russian, armenian, persian, israeli, and arab contractors.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable what junk the combination of crooked White immigrants and stone age indians are putting up in California.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White immigrants&#8221;? The russian federation has over 100 ethnicities, many of them non white. And the rest of those that you mention arent whites, they are mediterranians or central asiatics. You americans seem to think that anyone who isnt black is white. </p>

		<p>#24- What are the numbers like in the Russian Federation? I&rsquo;ve heard of plummeting birth rates and a lot of abortions among whites (I do realize there are many ethnicities). What proportion of the public would you say are Moslem? Part of me has felt that the salvation of the &#8220;white race&#8221; may lie in Russia, Ukraine, and eastern Europe in general. I just don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s starting to feel like a collective suicide. </p>

&ldquo;White immigrants&rdquo;? The russian federation has over 100 ethnicities, many of them non white.</p>
<p>I am poster 7.  </p>
<p>When I wrote russian crooked immigrant contractors I meant Great Russians, not Georgians, Tatars, Uzbeks or others. The Great Russian blonde, blue eyed tall over 6&rsquo;2 russian immigrants in America are as crooked and criminal as the asians, aremenians, persians,israelis and arabs.</p>
<p>Look up the daisy chain gasoline tax fraud pulled off by blonde, blue eyed paper white skinned over 6&rsquo;2 great russian crooks from the notorious great russian Brighton Beach neighborhood in New York. These Brighton Beach russians have replaced the old mafia and are a thousand times worse in both violent and fraud crime.</p>
<p>Blonde tall great russians may look a bit different from the asian, armenian, persian, israeli and arab immigrants, but they are as corrupt and criminal as the worst of the asians, indians and persians which is saying a lot.</p>
<p>What was the nationality of the fake Dr who stole over 1 billion dollars from our goverment health insurance medicare and medi-aid in just 1 year?  A tall, blonde russian with a fake medical degree.</p>
<p>What is the nationality of the so called building contactor who tore off roofs but had no idea how to put them back on?  Russian.<br>
His contractors license by the way was fake.  He just looked in the phone book, copied the license number of a real contractor and had some invoices, flyers and business cards made up.</p>
<p>When those of us who live in California and New York include russians with all the other criminal immigrants like asians, aremenians, israelis and arabs we don&rsquo;t care about ethnic distinctions.</p>
<p>We are writing about total  lack of morals and absolute depths of corruption and criminality.</p>
<p>If russians don&rsquo;t like to be included with asians, armenians, persians, israelis and arabs in a list of the leading criminal ethnic groups, then stop committing the frauds and crimes.</p>
<p>There must be a word for tall, blonde, blue eyed russians who pride themselves on their pure White nordic race but who are as crooked as any of those brunette people you so despise.</p>
<p>Maybe snow White outside, black hearted criminal inside.</p>
<p>Of all the immigrant groups, the hispanic business people are the most honest. They are also just about the only ones that actually pay their sales taxes.</p>
<p>Behave like a crooked asian, armenian, persian, israeli or arab and you will be treated like one.  Actually, as soon as people hear your name or see a russian name on a contractor&rsquo;s, Drs, cell phone store or any business people  steer clear because of the history of russian cheating and corruption since russians bean invading the United States.</p>
<p>When russians in America start behaving like honest respectable Whites Americans will accept them.  But for 40 years now it has been nothing but northern great russians who are as crooked as the rest of the immigrants.</p>

		<p>When I was living in Los Angeles ten years ago I got a cooking job at a well known restraunt on Sunset Bld.  I lasted three shifts.  The woman who ran the kitchen was furious when I showed up for my first shift.  She was a 5 foot nothing Mexindian.  She did nothing but complain to the owner and refused to speak English.  I was the only White working there besides the owner.  I also applied for various other cooking jobs in LA and was laughed out of one place.  It was all africans in that instance.  I ended up working a lousy supermarket job for low wages.  I&rsquo;ve also lived in Texas and you see those crews of mexicans building roads, high rises etc and you fret and wonder when it will all come crashing down.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Now over half of Florida really isn&rsquo;t America any longer and I suppose never will be&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  - I think about this too!  I used to vacation in florida in the 80s as a young boy, and each time I went it seemed to get more and more alien to me!  Last time I was there, about 2005, I vowed never to return as it was a foreign country with hostile natives who didn&rsquo;t give a hoot about me, even though I came with fistfulls of dollars and wanted to spend it on all kinds of wholesome diversions.  </p>

		<p>All of these groups are eligible for subsidized gov&rsquo;t loans as &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; minorities, including the rich Hindus, Chinese and Hasidic Jews. These loans, along with their legal ability to discriminate in favor of their own, give them a competitive advantage over whites.</p>

<p>I live in Los Angeles.  That is why I never, never eat out.  When someone asks me I insist that we have dinner at either my place or theirs.</p>
<p>I never even get a coke at a Mcdonald&rsquo;s or 7-11 on a hot day.</p>
<p>I also boycott the supermarkets.  I buy all my food at a chain called Trader Joe&rsquo;s which is the only chain around that hires a majority of White employees.  I don&rsquo;t see mexicans working at the Trader Joe&rsquo;s where I shop.  Trader Joe&rsquo;s hires American blacks as well, but according to the quota laws, not an entire work force like the goverment agencies. <br>

<p>Not 1 square inch of Russia is in Europe.  All of Russia is in central Asia.  Northwestern Russia, the home of the tall blonde blue eyed descendants of the viking invaders is in north central Asia.  No matter what you look like, Russians are central asians, north central, south central, west central or east central, the Russian federation is in central Asia.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;Yet, in California all the White parents are eager to get their kids  &mdash;  from preschool on up  &mdash;  to learn Spanish in the hope that this will insure that they have good futures.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hispanic indian immigrants are from primitive areas where there are no schools.  They often speak no spanish at all.  Some speak a tourist version, maybe 300 word vocabulary.</p>
<p>Ever heard of Iron Mountain the largest records and file storage company in the country?  Most of your medical, tax, social security, DMV, property ownership and other records are stored in Iron Mountain facilities.  Ever been involved in a lawsuit of any kind?  After it is settled your and the opposition attorney will send the paper records to Iron Mountain.</p>
<p>In California the Iron Mountain warehouses are staffed by primitive hispanic indians.  Even the men who answer the phones and deliver the records to whoever requested them don&rsquo;t speak a word of spanish.</p>
<p>Iron Mountain is not some tiny little company.  It is the largest record storage company in the country.  Most goverment records end up stored with Iron Mountain, including ICE and Customs.</p>

		<p>I visited New York recently and I was shocked at the low low prices of clothing the venders were selling.  It is now down to about $12.00 for a handbag and $5.00 for a cashmere scarf.  My first thought was they must be using slave labor because the price barely covers the expense of setting up a booth. </p>

<p> I used to live in Los Angeles as well. I would never eat at a restaurant unless I could seem them cooking the food. I had one favorite restaurant, and I did get along well with the Mexican help. They couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer, like family. I would not go to any other place though. I did not boycott the restaurant to protest Mexicans in any way. I just didn&rsquo;t want them to spit in my food, or worse. Many of them hate us. In another restaurant,  I was told by a Cuban what some of the Mexican staff was saying about us&hellip;.pretty hateful stuff. Don&rsquo;t let someone who hates you cook for you. <br>
