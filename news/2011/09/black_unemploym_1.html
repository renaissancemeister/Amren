<h1><a href="https://money.cnn.com/2011/09/02/news/economy/black_unemployment_rate/">Black Unemployment: Highest in 27 Years</a></h1>
 

<p>Annalyn Censky, CNN Money, September 2, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>The August jobs report was dismal for plenty of reasons, but perhaps most striking was the picture it painted of racial inequality in the job market.</p>
<p>Black unemployment surged to 16.7% in August, its highest level since 1984, while the unemployment rate for whites fell slightly to 8%, the Labor Department reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Black unemployment has been roughly double that of whites since the government started tracking the figures in 1972.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Even when you compare black and white workers, same age range, same education, you still see pretty significant gaps in unemployment rates,&#8221; said Algernon Austin, director of the Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy program at the Economic Policy Institute. &#8220;So I do think the fact of racial discrimination in the labor market continues to play a role.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 155,000 blacks got jobs in August, but the group&rsquo;s unemployment rate still went up because those jobs weren&rsquo;t enough to make up for all the people who started looking for work during the month.</p>
<p>However, the gain for whites of 211,000 jobs was enough to bring their unemployment rate down.</p>
<p>Overall, black men have it the worst, with joblessness at a staggeringly high 19.1%, compared to 14.5% for black women.</p>
