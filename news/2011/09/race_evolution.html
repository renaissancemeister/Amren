<h1><em>Race, Evolution and Behavior</em> now available in Russian.</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>J. Philippe Rushton&rsquo;s classic work, <em>Race, Evolution and Behavior</em> (reviewed in AR <a href="/ar/1994/12/index.html">here</a>, can be purchased <a href="https://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=2127&amp;category_id=95">here</a>) has been translated into Russian. Just released at the Moscow International Book Fair in September, it sells for 400 to 600 Rubles ($12 to $15), and is being snapped up by scientific libraries as well as the general public. Prof. Rushton wrote a special foreword for this edition, which includes essays by two Russian scholars. The translator, Dimitry Rumyantzev, has a PhD in biology and is also the translator of Richard Lynn&rsquo;s <em>Race Differences in Intelligence</em> (reviewed in AR <a href="/ar/2006/06/index.html#article1">here</a>, can be purchased <a href="https://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=2140&amp;category_id=95">here</a>). The book is published by Prophit  &mdash;  Style, based in Moscow. </p>
<p>A different publisher is now working on translations of Race by John Baker (reviewed in AR <a href="/ar/1993/11/index.html#article1">here</a>) and of <em>Erectus Walks Amongst Us</em> by Richard D. Fuerle (reviewed in AR <a href="/ar/2009/01/index.html#article1">here</a>). Caleton S. Coon&rsquo;s <em>The Races of Europe</em> is also scheduled for translation into Russian. </p>
<p>Russians are generally less brainwashed about race than Americans and Europeans, and these books are sure to find an excellent reception.</p>

<p>I bought the English hardback copy from the AR bookstore, and it is truly a book which actually says something.</p>
<p>BUT &hellip; I read somewhere that Asain IQ&rsquo;s tend to cluster around the mean, with not that many highs and lows; while Caucasian IQ&rsquo;s have a greater range, producing more geniuses, but also more sub-pars.</p>
<p>This is not in the Rushton book (I thought it was).</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a source? It would be appreciated. I have had no luck looking on the internet. </p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t find any study confirming a lower standard deviation for Asian IQs.  That does not necessarily mean that Asians produce the same amount of geniuses as whites.  IQ is not in fact normally distributed as most people believe.  See this link: <a href="https://www.abelard.org/burt/burt-ie.asp" rel="nofollow">https://www.abelard.org/burt/burt-ie.asp</a></p>
<p>Also sample sizes for these studies are usually too small to discern the frequency of geniuses.  Asians might have the same percentage of people that score above 140.  But if we are talking genius on the level of Newton, Archimedes and Gauss we are looking at IQs of above 180.  </p>
<p>Then there are other genetic factors like the 7R allele of the DRD4 gene associated with ADD/ADHD.  It is almost totally absent from East Asian populations.</p>

		<p>Great! I met Rushton in 06. You gotta admire, appreciate and respect these Western academicians for risking tenure, social mobility &amp; money for pure truth. They must have an understanding spouse to put up with ostracism. This is the book that did it for me. Until then all I had to were my own possibly subjective observations. But after REB I had facts and logic to back that up and I was more sure of myself in general than I&rsquo;d ever been before.</p>

		<p>It would be especially thoughtful and timely if racial realists<br>
traveling to Moscow from either the UK or the US could carry-on<br>
a few of the relevant scholarly classics of racial realism, these  to be productively placed in Russian hands  &mdash;  whether with proven translators or with major academic libraries within which, at this point,  English language volumes would be much appreciated.      </p>

<p>That graph is to indicate what the Asian distribution would have to look like for whites to yield the same smart fraction ( top 5% ) as Asians.  </p>
<p>From the article you linked: </p>
<p>&#8220;An Asian distribution with a [hypothetical] standard deviation 39 % of the white brings the two smart fractions into coincidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;there is no evidence to support such a difference in spread.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What La Griffe Du Lion is trying to analyze is WHY East Asians  (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong), all with homogeneous populations, have the highest IQs reported in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, but create countries with modest GDPs.</p>
<p>In <i>Smart Fraction II, Why Asians Lag</i>, La Griffe writes:</p>
<p><i>In market economies, per capita GDP is directly proportional to the population fraction with verbal IQ equal to or greater than 106.</i></p>
<p><i>Smart Fraction Theory recognizes that smart people produce wealth&hellip;In market economies, per capita GDP is directly proportional to the population fraction with verbal IQ at or above some determinable threshold.</i></p>
<p><i>Verbal IQ is a score derived from verbal subtests of an IQ test. The subtests measure abilities like abstract and common sense reasoning, language comprehension, short-term auditory memory, concentration, attention, word knowledge, verbal fluency and social judgment. It represents &#8220;verbal-analytical IQ.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>What is it about NE Asians that makes them different from other racial groups?&hellip;Their IQ is bifurcated. NE Asians owe that superior IQ  to extraordinary visuospatial ability, which, despite verbal shortcomings, lifts their IQ above that of Europeans.</i> </p>
<p><i>Among the races, only NE Asians and Amerindians exhibit this particular kind of verbal-nonverbal cognitive split. For other races verbal and general IQ averages have similar values, making the distinction between the two transparent to smart fraction theory. In the 12 studies reporting both general and verbal IQ for NE Asians, the general-verbal gap averaged 6.5 IQ points.</i></p>
<p><br>
Controversial?  YES, as is HBD, and La Griffe has taken heated criticism for his SF theory along with grudging respect.</p>
<p>Professor Rushton explains in <i>Race, Evolution and Behavior</i>:</p>
<p><i>Under adverse conditions natural selection [also] increased general intelligence and a trade-off in favor of visuospatial abilities over verbal because of the crucial role of strong visuospatial abilities for making sophisticated tools and weapons, and for the planning and execution of group hunting strategies.</i></p>

		<p>A source close to the translation of such realistic works into<br>
Russian, writes that during the Soviet regime much work in physical anthropology went forward in specific settings without any hindrance or conditions.  I presume it was understood by the person/s in charge there was to be no integrity between scientific knowledge and social policy. ( Is that difficult for contemporary Americans to imagine? )  Accordingly, skepticism about a mere out-of-Africa model had its adherents in the USSR based partly  on work done within that nation.  Some irony that Carleton Coon&rsquo;s work would be seen nowadays in Russia as yet having some pulse beat when it has been buried again and again within his own nation.      </p>

		<p>Anyone interested in European vs. Asian average intelligence should look up the EU studies on IQ.  Also, check on any study regarding Jews, who are of course mostly white and often have a lot of German and Polish heritage as well as Hebrew.<br>
The EU study cites by nation, so it&rsquo;s presumable that the non-whites within each country dilute high intelligence.  Still, Germany ranks first in Europe (or any other nation I&rsquo;ve seen) with 109, which is well above the 103-104 often attributed to Japan, China, and Korea.  Studies regarding Jews usually have a figure of around 115, which is in marked contrast to Israel with its many Arabs and, for that matter, Russians.  </p>

		<p>I thank everyone for the info on Asian/Caucasian IQ.</p>
<p>This is another one of those subjects which seems deceptively simple, but is not!</p>
<p>Asians boost their IQ with visuo-spatial ability, Ashkenazis with verbal ability, ethnic Germans with scientific, left-brain ability  &mdash;  who can untangle it all?</p>
<p>In his book, Rushton lists the impressive inventions and discoveries of the (some) Asians. (Apparently, he did not build a house with Chinese wall-board, or feed his dog Chinese dog-food!) </p>
<p>I think the only thing for sure is that sub-Saharan Africans, in general, do not do well on IQ tests or scholastics.   </p>

As for the IQ issue. Why is it that Jews can claim a higher IQ than others while at the time time claiming to be White?</p>
<p>It seems they want it both ways. They want to be considered White but they also want to attribute their higher IQ, not to their White genetic heritage, but to their Jewish genetic heritage. </p>

		<p>It is of some relevance to note the official, written ban on<br>
IQ tests put in place by the Soviet regime in 1935.  I am unaware of any appreciable translation of documents, testimony, studies,<br>
deliberations, if any, that were undertaken to arrive at this<br>
policy ( or even done ad hoc to buttress a pre-determined outcome).<br>
Reportedly, the policy applied to all domains of Soviet society<br>
and thus included research and not merely practical applications in employment and education.  Translators dealing with the realities of race and human evolution might make a reciprocal <br>
contribution by translating such primary materials into English.   <br>

<p>There are claims that jews have about 110-115 in verbal IQ but only about 90 in spatial IQ. I myself are sceptical to jewish claims of superior or different IQs because the necessary evolutionary background isnt there. Evolving your brain takes much longer than evolving your body if we judge by the fossil record. Its far easier to explain abnormal jewish results with non-repesentative test takers in too small examination or normalization groups. </p>
<p>When we speak about IQ tests, we have to remember that they consist of many smaller subtests that test both &#8220;G&#8221; (what we mean with smarts) and &#8220;P&#8221; which is basically how fast our brains work. Some tests are more G-loaded and others are heavily P-loaded. </p>
<p>These results are then weighted together to a final IQ score. This means two persons with an identical IQ score can have very different minds. IMHO, if anything, verbal IQ is overweighted and visual IQ is underweighted (this penalizes males and favors women). In our egalitarian age, it would not look good if males persistenly outsmarted women on IQ tests. Juggle a bit with the weighting, and poof problem solved. </p>
<p>Futhermore, IQ tests completely ignores the added dimension of personality, its perfectly possible to have a very high IQ yet be totally irrational/emotionally driven or utterly uninterested in anything pertaining to the non social world. Also, if we look at the edge of normal we find people with mental dysfunctionalities that gives them noticeably increased scores on IQ tests, yet these smart people are dysfunctional in their daily life. </p>
<p>Furthermore, despite their superior IQs the japanese, chinese, koreans etc were stuck in the late iron age well into the 1800s - Japan was forcibly pried open by USA in 1852. If it wasnt, its quite likely it would be in the modernizing stage right now like China. </p>

None of the data in the essay you posted is attributed to a any source, much less a credible one. The diagram of differing bell curves for whites and Orientals does not explain why the representation of Orientals at elite colleges and universities in the United States is out of proportion to their numbers in the U.S. population. <br>
 <br>
Even if the high average IQ of Orientals includes a low standard deviation, the fact that the Oriental average is high means that a higher percentage of Orientals can be trained for complex job skills than the percentage of whites that can be trained for those skills. </p>

<p>You missed La Griffe&rsquo;s point, John.  Read my second post and the second La Griffe article I posted.  </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to explain why the GDP of Asians countries is lower than that of White countries if Asians have higher IQS as reported in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>.</p>
<p>If Asians do indeed have higher IQs why is it Whites (with their lower IQs) who invented the modern world??  Who created countries with higher GDPs?</p>
<p>His contention is that Whites have a higher, more creative smart fraction among their elite IQs - and it is from THIS population that major discoveries are made; they are the ones who move civilization forward.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence certainly supports this theory, Rushton as well as in his book Race, Evolution and Behavior.</p>
<p>And, as I stated in my second post, it IS contentious and La Griffe has taken a lot of heat.</p>
<p>So, John, maybe you would like to explain why Asians are not as creative as Whites?  Why their countries have lower GDPs?  Why their countries look like THIS?:</p>

<p>Who cares who&rsquo;s 102 or 106? My question is why people with IQ averages of 82  and who are committing most of the crimes are getting money from white people to perpetuate their sloth or continue breeding borderline mental rejects.</p>

There is no contradiction between being Jewish and being white.Jews are a sub race within the white race, and by every criteria the most superior racial group in existence. (I am a Nordic gentile, by the way.) <br>

 <br>
Ashkenazi Jews have the highest IQ IQ of any ethnic group known. They average 112-115, well above the European norm of 100&hellip;<br>
 <br>
We propose that the Ashkenazi Jews have a genetic advantage in intelligence that arose from natural selection for success in white-collar occupations during their sojourn in northern Europe&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Ashkenazi Jews are vastly over represented in science. Their numbers among prominent scientists are roughly ten times greater than you&rsquo;d expect from their share of the population in the United States and Europe. Over the past two generations they have won more than a quarter of all Nobel science prizes, although they make up less than one-six-hundredth of the world&rsquo;s populations. Although they represent less than 3 percent of the U.S. population, they won 27 percent of the U.S. Nobel prizes in science during that period&hellip;they make up about 22 percent of Ivy League students.<br>

<p>That is irrelevant, and is only a distraction to the  ultimate issue of race replacement. I don&rsquo;t care how high their IQs or how high their SAT scores, they DO NOT BELONG HERE. </p>
<p>This was founded to be our country, not theirs.  We need a homeland for ourselves, just as they have theirs.  All white countries are under racial attack. Theirs are not.  Far from being innocuous and beneficial to us, their high IQs will only aid them in taking over our country all the more quickly. </p>
<p>Just look at the Jews who arrived here a mere century ago in poverty, but are now the dominant and wealthiest group.  Will control ultimately become a contest  between Chinese and Jews, with the rest of us being just pawns on the ethnic chessboard? </p>

<p><b>You are wrong.</b></p>
<p>Have you read Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s <i>White Identity</i>?  Or anything the Founding Fathers wrote?  Obviously not.  America was not created as a &#8220;multi-cultural&#8221; nation welcoming the &#8220;world&rsquo;s refuse.&#8221;  It was created by and for whites and only whites.</p>
<p>Here, for the unenlightened, those who graduated from &#8220;social justice&#8221; high schools and colleges, or are well-versed in the mendacious writings of Tim Wise, Howard Zinn and Bill Ayers, are the words of <b>THOSE WHO WROTE THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.</b></p>
<p>1, Thomas Jefferson in Notes on the State of Virginia discouraged building the future nation out of immigration: <i>It is for the happiness of those united in society to harmonize as much as possible &hellip;</i> Immigration risked bringing in habits and outlooks rendering our polity <i>a heterogeneous, incoherent, distracted mass.</i></p>
<p>Is that not what we have now, Mr. Engelman?  From those who ignored the words of the Founding Fathers?  Those who wished to destroy White America?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more, lots more, for those whose desire it is to vilify whites and rewrite  American history:</p>
<p>2,  Alexander Hamilton: The opinion advanced in [Jefferson&rsquo;s] Notes on Virginia is undoubtedly correct &hellip; <i>The influx of foreigners must &hellip; tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit &hellip; to introduce foreign propensities.</i></p>
<p>John Adams: <i>My opinion with respect to immigration is that except of useful mechanics and some particular description of men and professionals, there is no use of encouragement.</i></p>
<p>James Madison wanted only  <i>foreigners of merit and republican principles.</i></p>
<p>And there is this in the Preamble of the United States Constitution:</p>
<p><i>We the People of the United States, in Order to &hellip; secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</i></p>
<p>Not the world&rsquo;s posterity, meaning white posterity.</p>
<p>(h/t to E Pluribus Pluribus)</p>
<p><i>In 1790, the U.S. Congress established naturalization procedures that provided the first rules to be followed by the United States in the granting of national citizenship. This law limited naturalization to immigrants who were</i> <b>free white persons</b> <i>of &ldquo;good moral character.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>  &mdash;  Jared Taylor, <i>White Identity</i></p>
<p>What is it about these things you cannot understand, Engelman?</p>
<p><i>Third world racial groups often fight each other. Whites and Orientals get along fine. I have never felt unsafe in an Oriental neighborhood, however late at night it was.</i></p>
<p>I used to be able to leave my doors and windows unlocked at night when my neighborhood was all white.  Despite the fact that Asians have low crime rates does not mean they belong here in the United States.</p>
<p>Wait until they&rsquo;re your overlords, Engelman.  They are not like us whites who are tolerant of others.  Try sneaking into or immigrating to one of their countries and demanding citizenship and see what happens.  See what happens if you are accused of being a spy.   Why should it be any different for us?</p>
<p>Also, Engelman,  you have not given reasons as to the efficacy of importing Asians to colonized the United States and race-replace our own white children.</p>

		<p>I do not wish to tell Russians what they should do - leave that to the ruling circles of the US &amp; UK!  But Coon&rsquo;s &#8220;Races of Europe&#8221; although a formidable tome is a bit dated, and the section on Jewish ethnology isn&rsquo;t satisfactory (I am not making an anti-semitic point, and I am not a Khazar=Ashkenazim theorist); it seems to be a repudiation of Hans Guenther and possibly influenced (for contemporary political reasons) by Ashley Montagu (a later opponent) among his then consultants.  His &#8220;Origin of Races&#8221; theory has had a bit of a comeback, but is still open to timeline &amp; DNA criticism. More relevant today was his work on Racial Aptitudes and the Living Races of Man.  Nevertheless, he was the doyen of biological anthropology and a beautiful writer. The fate of Baker&rsquo;s book (called in and destroyed by its university publisher) should be noted in an introduction. Rushton and Lynn may exaggerate the average Mongolid IQ (not discussed in detail by Baker) - how many tests reflect the East Asian peasant interior? An old journalist classic is Lothrop Stoddard&rsquo;s &#8220;Clashing Tides of Colour&#8221; (Scribner 1935) which is worth reprinting with an updated preface &amp; annotation (not his other books).</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think many people feel that it is the publishers themselves  &mdash;  whether Oxford University Press or John Wiley &amp; Sons  &mdash;  who remove from printing and access books like John Randall Baker&rsquo;s RACE or, later, Chris Brand&rsquo;s THE &#8220;g&#8221; FACTOR.  After Oxford University Press ceased printing RACE not long after it was published in 1974, the book was resurrected by an American ad hoc publisher in 1981.  Brand&rsquo;s book, actually depublished and pulled off the shelves of booksellers in 1996, has not been<br>
resurrected other than for his bulldog determination to make it freely accessible online for indivdual reading.  Market demand in both instances was evident enough from sales.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m lost as to why books of merit when published should be considered out-of-date unless they are being advanced as conventional textbooks, say, for advanced undergraduate classes.<br>
The Russian publishing effort has some indication of being dedicated to a chronology of meritorious scholarly accomplishments.  It&rsquo;s not a Reader&rsquo;s Digest undertaking.   Prescience is not a requirement.     </p>

		<p>In due course, perhaps in Russia some scholarship can arise <br>
explaining why racial realism had no place in Marxism-Leninism.<br>
According to the dictum &#8221; Nothing scientific can be alien to<br>
Marxism&#8221; it does not seem ideologically axiomatic that what we<br>
know as &#8220;Jensenism&#8221; should have presented problems within the framework of that worldview.  Obviously, from a tactical standpoint of rallying the working class,and rallying Africa against colonialism and imperialism,  the &#8220;Jensenism&#8221;  reality presented its challenges to any Party leadership.  Surely contemporary Russian political science  confronts this question?  <br>

Certainly, it would be a sad omission if the Baker translation in Russia did not contain either an introduction or special appendix<br>
adequate to the facts of this majestic work of scholarship having been depublished very soon after the first printing in 1974.  Long efforts by researchers mindful of the repressions surrounding work in this domain of scholarship, and helped by funding sources aimed to counteract such repression, all managed to get the book republished in 1981 in the U.S.  The ad hoc publisher handling the matter was simply one of a few such ad hoc efforts arising initially about 1957 or so.  This was when the meritorious work by Audrey Shuey THE TESTING OF NEGRO INTELLIGENCE could find no conventional publisher on the great<br>
merits of the book.  The book avoided a &#8220;samizdat USA&#8221; status<br>
only by such an ad hoc effort.  Indeed, it would be sad if the Russian readers were not made mindful of the relevant history.</p>

		<p>My information was that Baker&rsquo;s book aroused a storm of criticism for its &#8220;anti-black racism&#8221;, was called in by the publishers and as many copies as possible pulped; Ashley Montagu&rsquo;s &#8220;Man&rsquo;s Most Dangerous Myth&#8221; propaganda work was then hastily reissued by way of an &#8220;apology&#8221;. I cannot be certain about my recollection, but I think the now deceased Mrs Baker confirmed this in a letter of enquiry. The difficulty of getting good books published, reprinted or marketed, that offend Big Brother (or Big Sister) is probably worse in Airstrip One than anywhere else.<br>
Look at the negligible academic repudiation of &#8220;feminism&#8221;; Goldberg&rsquo;s book is o/p and you can only get bits slipped in discreetly by iconoclasts like Pinker.  &#8220;Academic&#8221; publishing in Britain is dominated by a (partly legally enforced) PC totalitarianism, not unlike the BBC, Open University and viewspapers like The Observer. Careers depend on it - q.v. contributors to &#8220;Patterns of Prejudice&#8221;, &#8220;Anthropology Today&#8221; and innumerable similar journals.  <br>
Who was the Russian who said the only communist nomenklatura left is running Anglo-American universities? You can actually trace the rot chronologically - for instance, Penguin books in its leftwing student phase. The statism of influential (ex?)-marxists in our institutions may have been dropped, but not their &#8220;all humans are equal&#8221; (except us) automatism.</p>

<p>Coon reportedly was trained to consider scientific manner above<br>
the matter of who might get the breakthrough &#8220;prizes&#8221;.  His brief commissioned opinion on the plausibility of the existence of a Big Foot is a remarkable example of brilliance and courage and clarity that  destroys at once any notion of sensationalism or any regard to &#8220;a show of hands&#8221; as a supreme test of validity.  The looming question  &mdash;  ironically maybe more among Russian intellectuals than here in the USA  &mdash;  is why his work has been so entirely disregarded on American campuses.  If, as one reasonably suspects, it has been shunned not for its dated aspects  but for it surviving virtues  &mdash;  then what&rsquo;s dated is not especially relevant?  A layman gets the sense that science in this matter of human origins now has soul searching to do about deeming certain questions from the &#8220;bone&#8221; people as being mere &#8220;static&#8221; or &#8220;loose ends&#8221; when now it appears they were very merited and that in the whole picture of &#8220;Eureka narcissism&#8221; abiding mysteries turn out now to have been just as important as breakthroughs. ?? </p>

agreements basic to freeing up a &#8220;taboo&#8221; book to be republished )<br>
that can after a few decades  be made public?  It increases the likelihood that eventually enough clear facts will<br>
surface that &#8220;sharks&#8221; seeking to stifle books, etc., can not rest too assured that &#8220;no one will ever know&#8221; as to what actually went on.   We need all the disincentives we can lay hold of.</p>

as to how a few  individuals do manage to &#8220;see the light&#8221;.  There&rsquo;s more education at some of the booths in the coffee shops off campus than anywhere within the lecture halls and graduate seminar rooms.    </p>
