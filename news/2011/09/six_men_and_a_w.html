			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Dolan and James Slack, Daily Mail (London), September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police and security officials believe they have smashed a plot by home-grown terrorists to kill hundreds in an Al Qaeda-inspired attack on Britain.</p>
<p>One of 14 homes raided by officers yesterday belongs to a convicted terrorist involved in a conspiracy to capture and behead a British soldier.</p>
<p>Acting on intelligence from MI5, counter-terrorism police in Birmingham arrested six men and a woman, who were all born in Britain and hold UK passports.</p>
<p>They are suspected of being in the latter stages of planning an atrocity, though a precise target had yet to be chosen. Police say they swooped to protect public safety.</p>
<p>Whitehall sources say it is the biggest plot to have been disrupted by the security services this year. It comes only three months after officials downgraded the threat to the UK from severe to substantial.</p>
<p>Fourteen Birmingham addresses, including one business, were being searched yesterday.</p>
<p>They included a terraced property owned by Mohammed Irfan, 34, and Mohammed Rizwan, who preach at a mosque. Forensics officers were also seen yesterday searching a neighbouring home in the city&rsquo;s deprived Ward End district.</p>
<p>Irfan was jailed for four years in February 2008 after admitting being part of plot to behead a Muslim soldier as warning to other Muslims about joining the British Army. He was released on licence in October 2009.</p>
<p>Those under arrest were said by neighbours to include a nursery nurse and two brothers. One of the addresses was an imposing five-bedroom detached home occupied by a taxi driver and his five sons. A neighbour said two of the sons had been seen firing an air rifle at a target in the garden on Sunday.</p>
<p>The arrests were carried out across the largely Asian inner-city neighbourhoods of Alum Rock, Sparkbrook, Ward End and Moseley, a suburb popular with students and young professionals.</p>
<p>Although the terror suspects were home-grown, sources said the plot had an &#8216;international dimension&rsquo;.</p>
<p>West Midlands Police said six men  &mdash;  aged between 25 and 32  &mdash;  were arrested overnight on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism in the UK following a joint investigation by both police and MI5.</p>
<p>A 22-year-old-woman, named by neighbours as nursery nurse Salma Kabal, from Alum Rock, was said to have been arrested at 7am on suspicion of failing to disclose information contrary to the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>
<p>Neighbours in the terraced street yesterday said Kabal comes from a &#8216;moderate&rsquo; Pakistani family and is the eldest of five children.</p>
<p>Her mother is said to work as a school dinner lady, while her father is a former council worker.</p>
<p>She married two years ago but was said to have divorced her husband six months ago. One neighbour said: &#8216;He moved in with her and wore a long Islamic beard.</p>
<p>&#8216;He didn&rsquo;t seem to work, but was more extremist than his wife. I understand they split up because he wanted to take her to live in a madrassa in Karachi in Pakistan.&rsquo; The husband was believed to be Ashiq Ali, who was arrested with his brother Bahader, 28, who runs a gym.</p>
<p>The brothers are understood to have an English stepmother, who converted to Islam before marrying their father, a taxi driver.</p>
<p>Neighbours said Kabal adopted the full Islamic niqab after marrying in a Islamic service carried out at her home. She is said to have cast off the full veil in recent weeks.</p>
<p>One witness reported seeing three men being arrested as they climbed into an old Volkswagen Passat in Sparkbrook. The car was later taken away for examination.</p>
<p>Police say the arrests were made by unarmed officers, indicating there was no expectation of finding explosives or weapons during the raids.</p>
<p>David Rose, 50, a marketing executive who lives next to the address raided in Moseley, said: &#8216;They took away the father&rsquo;s black cab and three or four other cars owned by the sons. The police also found a lot of religious paraphernalia  &mdash;  a loud hailer, Islamic leaflets and other stuff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The arrests were not related to the Liberal Democrat conference, which is taking place at the city&rsquo;s International Convention Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Why the terrorism threat to the UK remains high</strong></p>
<p>The alleged Birmingham plot is considered &#8216;the biggest in numbers and scale&rsquo; since the end of 2010, according to officials in the security services.</p>
<p>Back then, nine suspects were charged with plotting a Christmas bomb blitz on London landmarks. All nine are still awaiting trial.</p>
<p>There have been other arrests since, but nothing to rival dawn raids in Birmingham, leading to six men and one woman being taken in custody on suspicion of plotting a mass casualty attack.</p>
<p>The case is a reminder that  &mdash;  while Al Qaeda-inspired terrorism has not been making headlines this year  &mdash;  the threat to the UK remains grave.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why people may have felt less at risk in recent months.</p>
<p>Chief among them is the killing of Osama bin Laden and the deaths of other senior Al Qaeda figures in the lawless borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This has led officials in Washington to speak of the much reduced threat posed by the organisation.</p>
<p>However, long before the killing of its leader, Al Qaeda was acting as an inspiration for would-be fanatics in Britain, rather than playing an operational or planning role in attacks.</p>
<p>Terrorists are no longer necessarily imported from overseas, but radicalised in the UK over the internet. All those arrested yesterday hold British passports.</p>
<p>There was also a reduction in the published UK terror threat level in July, moving it down from severe to substantial .</p>
<p>Severe means the risk of a terrorist attack is considered to be a strong possibility and &#8216;might well occur without further warning&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The substantial level  &mdash;  which officials do not intend to change after  yesterday&rsquo;s arrests  &mdash;  means an attack is a strong possibility.</p>
<p>Security sources say the lower threat does not mean there has been a reduction in terrorist activity, but rather that plots are being detected and disrupted earlier.</p>
<p>The workload  &mdash;  the number of potential terrorists who are being monitored  &mdash;  is as great as at any time in the past five or six years, officials say.</p>
<p>With the Olympics on the horizon  &mdash;  considered the biggest peace-time security challenge this country has faced  &mdash;  it is likely to get worse before it gets better.</p>

<p>That has happened a lot in mexico recently.  Mexican criminals often fought and killed police and military but never beheaded them until very, very recently.</p>
<p>Hmmm Wonder if a new element has been injected into mexican criminal organizations recently?</p>

<p>That would be a council house paid for by the taxpayers.  Huousing benefit rules mandate that no more than 2 share a bedroom.  Only married couples can share bedrooms. So if a muslim family has 6 boys and 5 girls, that means 6 bedrooms,1 for the parents, 3 for the boys and 3 for the girls with 1 girl getting her own bedroom.</p>
<p>Since most houses with more than 4 bedrooms are mansions, that is what the lifelong benefit gougers get.  Meanwhile, White English don&rsquo;t get married and have kids because the can&rsquo;t afford to buy a small 2 bedroom condo.</p>

		<p>What I really cannot understand about all of these Pakistani terrorist plots is that the wannabe (as opposed to Wahabi) terrorists are all perfectly happy and willing to voluntarily live in a nation they obviously despise.<br>
  An honorable White man just cannot get his head around this, he instinctively realise that certain values have are worth more than any amount of cash and would endure any hardship for those principles.<br>
  Pakistanis are obviously playing some sort of duplicitous game.This says all you need about there character.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The were all born in Britain and hold UK passports.&#8221;<br>
So what? That hasn&rsquo;t meant a thing since the 1950s. Before disastrous left wing policy the thing it used to mean was &#8220;whiter than a ghost.&#8221; All born in Britain, all have UK passports, 2 of them are named Mohammed and preach at mosques. Do you see what I mean?</p>
<p>The media sees fit to call every Muslim terrorist suspect as Asian because I guess Pakistan is still technically a part of Asia, and they can pretend that every bearded, Arab looking violent extremist is really Pakistani. I haven&rsquo;t a clue as to what difference this would make when a couple of people named Mohammed detonate bombs but it seems to make them feel better.</p>
<p>The media and the powers that be absolutely refuse to acknowledge Pakistani and Arab Muslim extremism and terrorism. As much as I complain about calling them Asians, I am amazed that they will even do that nowadays.</p>
<p>Madrassa, mosque and Mohammed or anything like them will soon be banned, as well. The properly politically correct will then be able to delude themselves into thinking that all terrorism is done by evil white males.</p>

<p>My guess is that Saudi money will be found behind it.  Just as the Mexican government has paid for private schools for teaching anti-Americanism to Hispanic children in the Southwest as a prelude to the &#8220;reconquesta,&#8221; Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations support Mosques and Muslim communities in Europe.  They too are aimed at an eventual geographical expansion of Arab territory into Europe.  We have already read that the South of Europe is gone and no investors are interested in those nations any longer because their upcoming generations will be majority Muslim and therefore Muslim controlled and governed.  There are some signs of resistance to this eventuality, but the boat sailed long ago.</p>

		<p>Folk should look to post World War I Turkey - nationalist leader Ataturk for the most effective ways of dealing with nasty, lower caste Islam. Turkey is a secular Republic and looks to White Europe for culture and economics. Turkey is a officially a secular Republic and the army is given the mission of protecting the secular republic. Thus if any Religious forces (only going to be Islam, though idiot US Southern Bible Belt folks cause a lot of trouble here) threaten the secular republic the army steps in, suspends democracy, arrests and kills people that need to be arrested and or killed. This model would work fine for France, Holland and England.</p>

		<p>It has always interested me (more like stumped me) why religious fanatics, especially Islamist Extremists, feel the need to cause and create terror in a country that is so obsessed with bending over backwards to appease these volatile hoards, almost exclusively at the expense of said country&rsquo;s own White indigenous population. The UK government will give you anything you want! I guess it is a matter of low IQ. I sure would want to be nice to a group of people who are responsible for my jobless benefits every week. But then again those with a decent IQ can most likely fend for themselves anyway. But in this global &#8220;downturn&#8221; economy, a lot of hard-workers and smart college educated kids are w/o work. It&rsquo;s sad to see.</p>
<p>And why would it take 7 Muslims to kidnap &kill; one lone British soldier. Here&rsquo;s an idea. Make all the Pakistanis &amp; Bangladeshis fight for the British in a war before giving them citizenship. Then if they threaten to kidnap and kill a soldier it&rsquo;ll probably be one of their Muslim brothers. If one of their leaders do not agree to take a British Muslim soldier, tell them that he made a statement to convert to Hinduism or Christianity. Then it may get real ugly.</p>

		<p>11 Jack in Chicago:</p>
<p>American Christian conservatives might be loopy enough on race sometimes (actually, most of the time), but they are hardly a threat to secular government and the concept of non-establishmentarianism.  The religious heritage of most American whites is one of fleeing state sponsored religious persecution and state establishment of religion   &mdash;   It stands to reason that even seriously Christian Americans wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate government establishment of religion.  In fact, the tendency in the American body politic, to wit, ACLU et al., is to be paranoid about establishmentarianism.</p>
<p>The real threat to secular government is Shari&rsquo;ah.  Not only from its actual practitioners, but from the non-Islamic politicians, judges and media sources that seem to have no problem with it.</p>

<p>Exactly, it was the Bradford and Leeds textile mills.  After WW2 English wages rose to lower middle class levels instead of the poverty levels early 20th century.</p>
<p>The mill owners just refused to pay English wages so they brough in the Pakistanis and set up them on benefit.  with benefit and council housing taking care of the necessities, the Pakistanis were happy to work for spending money.</p>
<p>Exact similiar situation in America today.  The taxpayer takes care of all the necessities for the hispanic illegals.  So they can raise 5 kids on $15,000 per year.<br>
