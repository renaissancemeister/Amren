			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Chase, Yahoo! Sports, September 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Oh no, she did it again.</p>
<p>Mt. Serena erupted once more in defeat Sunday at the U.S. Open. This time it happened in the tournament final after chair umpire Eva Asderaki ruled that Serena&rsquo;s loud &#8220;come on!,&#8221; which she yelled during what she thought was a forehand winner, had been shrieked before the point was over. Since it interrupted opponent Sam Stosur&rsquo;s attempt at a return, Asderaki properly awarded Stosur the point because of the &#8220;hindrance rule&#8221; that states a player can&rsquo;t verbally interfere with the opponent&rsquo;s points.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Serena was understandably displeased, though she had no ground on which to stand. The call was obvious. Serena disagreed and became more incensed when she thought that the umpire, Asderaki, was the same official who was in the chair for her infamous 2009 blowup at the tournament. It wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&rsquo;t you the one who screwed me over last time here?&#8221; Serena asked after being told of the point penalty. &#8220;Yeah, you are.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Stosur looked momentarily stunned. Serena went on to break Stosur to even the match and continued her diatribe against the umpire during the next two changeovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;A code violation because I expressed who I am? We&rsquo;re in America last I checked. Am I gonna get violated for a water? Really, don&rsquo;t even look at me. I promise you, don&rsquo;t look at me because I am not the one. Don&rsquo;t look my way.&#8221; [ &hellip; ]</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ever see me walking down the hall, walk the other way. Because you&rsquo;re out of control. Totally out of control. You&rsquo;re a hater, you&rsquo;re unattractive inside. Who would do such a thing? And I never complain. Wow.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The same impotent U.S. Open officials who were bullied by men&rsquo;s players into moving the final because of rain and put a women&rsquo;s semifinal on a small court sat silent as Serena humiliated Asderaki. {snip}</p>
<p>For an instant it looked like Serena would be invigorated by the incident. Stosur broke soon after and went to win 6-2, 6-3 in a stunning upset.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Her consumption of steroids causes her to lose her temper. Judging by the size of her muscles she is using performance enhancing drugs. she lost to a better opponent and hopefully for the game of tennis she decides to take retirement. she is bad for the game period.</p>

		<p> Serena Williams, like so many blacks, especially in professional sports, tries to get her way by yelling at and threatening smaller, nearly always White, officials. Notice that she said, &#8220;We&rsquo;re in America last time I checked,&#8221; and &#8220;You&rsquo;re a hater!&#8221; She was trying to imply racial bias. In other words, she was playing the race card. She&rsquo;s done it before, no doubt she&rsquo;ll do it again. A $2,000 fine? You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding! That would be like five bucks to me.</p>
<p> It seems that Williams learned her angry, confrontational attitude from her father, who I&rsquo;ve heard carries a permanent grudge against White people.</p>

Every athlete eventually reaches and then passes their peak performance just as new and younger players come along. Some accept this with grace. Others do not.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause of this outburst, it&rsquo;s bad sportsmanship and shouldn&rsquo;t be tolerated among professionals of this level.</p>

She broke the rule, she was penalized.</p>
<p>But what was really ugly is her diatribe towards the umpire, calling her ugly and a hater.  Then she tells the umpire not to look at her, as though she is scolding a child.  Most professional sports won&rsquo;t tolerate that type of abuse.  They tolerate it a little in baseball, but the umpire has the final say  and can through eject the player or the coach.  In baseball it is just theatrics.  But in tennis it seems personal, very ugly insults.</p>

		<p>Hopefully tennis will give this disrespectful black woman one last chance and after the third strike ban her from tennis. It probably won&rsquo;t happen though as the cries of racism would surely be heard. I don&rsquo;t understand how the official was humiliated as the article stated. Seems to me this ridiculous tirade should humiliate the obnoxious black spewing the hate.</p>

		<p> As a proud Aussie I took great delight in watching `Serene`Serena <br>
getting whipped fair and square by our Sammy Stosur<br>
 This time  I turned on the TV after the outburst but remembered watching the other incident live on TV a few years ago when she menaced the slightly built lineswoman with her racquet and threatened to `fxxking kill her`  for making what she thought was an incorrect call. I watched dumbfounded that such <br>
an outburst was not more severely punished as apparently on this occasion also .    <br>
  Why do black athletes(even females) with very few exceptions show this thug ghetto mentality.Or perhaps that`s a rhetorical question.<br>
  For what its worth  to Serena`s credit she did admit after the game that despite the disputed point she lost to the better player.<br>
Its pity the temper tantrums mar what would be a great game of tennis .     </p>

		<p>Many blacks will push whitey as far as they can.  In the past, most learned that there would be immediate reaction to such behavior and had enough common sense to refrain.  <br>
Some people see Williams&rsquo;s antics as those of a diva.  But it&rsquo;s merely typical black behavior.  And Serena, with her obvious abundance of testosterone, is more likely to explode than more feminine black women.  She, like many other black people, are self-defeating.</p>

		<p>Miss Williams was raised in a very much top-of-the middle-class home, if not outright  wealthy. She acts like any ghetto-raised &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; female sports thug. It just goes to show it&rsquo;s not the status of the home in which the child is raised, it&rsquo;s the IQ of the person playing. (To put it any more bluntly would be &#8220;racisss&hellip;) </p>

		<p>She still beat everyone until the final. Thing is, she&rsquo;s fat, slow, out of shape and thinks that just being black is enough when it&rsquo;s not. She&rsquo;s still better than almost all the rest, but just not quite. It takes practice and work and she doesn&rsquo;t do that at the moment. She&rsquo;s the number one money winner of all time even though Graf has almost twice as many titles. So, she&rsquo;s made more money than anyone else, but feels she&rsquo;s being picked on. No one is buying it. </p>

		<p>Well&hellip; She&rsquo;s in the spotlight a lot and 98 times out of a hundred DOESN&rsquo;T act like that. Not that I&rsquo;m feeling apologetic about black behavior, but having lived through Jimmy Conners, John McEnroe, and the Ryan Leaf era of the San Diego Chargers this doesn&rsquo;t seem noteworthy other than the &#8220;hater&#8221; reference, which only a non-white would ever feel entitled to use.</p>
<p>Saw Serena up close awhile back. She&rsquo;s 5&rsquo;10,&#8221; about 150 pounds, and not bad looking for the type. Not MY type, though.</p>

		<p>I will never forget back in the late &rsquo;90s or early 2000 when one of the Williams&rsquo;sisters( or brothers, by physical appearance) were playing in the French Open. The French crowd was raucously cheering because Venus or Serena was getting beat. After the match Venus said how unprofessional the crowd was. Is she the pot or the kettle? What comes around goes around in athletics, too. It made me want to be a Frenchman for a minute.</p>

		<p>Even though Selena&rsquo;s feminity has been questioned on this page more than once, Amren staff is guilty of handing out the ultimate  insult to the umpire and not her by giving this article the sub-heading &#8220;Accosts umpire even though <b>he</b> made the right call.&#8221; on the main news page.</p>
<p>Really pity that poor woman!</p>

		<p>To the best of my knowledge, John McEnroe never threatened anybody with physical harm. He threw a tantrum, but she has made at least an implied threat to two umpires/line judges.</p>
<p>Hard to believe people want to downplay her behavior.</p>

Of course she thought it was the same Umpire! After all, we Whites and Asians, we all look alike</p>
<p><br>
Funny. That&rsquo;s what many Whites have long said about Blacks and Hispancis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many blacks will push whitey as far as they can. In the past, most learned that there would be immediate reaction to such behavior and had enough common sense to refrain.<br>
Some people see Williams&rsquo;s antics as those of a diva. But it&rsquo;s merely typical black behavior. And Serena, with her obvious abundance of testosterone, is more likely to explode than more feminine black women. She, like many other black people, are self-defeating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feminine Black women? It&rsquo;s easier to find a four leaf clover</p>

Are you serious? Yes. He did. I remember his juvenile outbursts. Also, check out you tube. You can see for yourself that he made a number of threats to referees and others. If anything, it is hard to believe that some of you want are making such a big deal out of this largely non-story.. </p>

<p>To be frank, comments like yours and similar posters of your ilk are disgraceful. They do little to promote our movement to Whites who may visit this website and see such mean-spirited, arguably, misogynist rhetoric. You (and others) should be ashamed of yourselves.</p>

<p>Not only am I not ashamed of myself, I take pride in being able to express myself without being intimidated by political correctness. You speak of &#8220;our movement&#8221; yet you give yourself away with standard leftist terms like &#8220;mean-spirited&#8221; and &#8220;misogynist.&#8221; Were you so indignant when Bill Maher called Sara Palin a &#8220;bimbo?&#8221;  <br>
You speak of &#8220;our movement&#8221; but I wonder how upset you are at the constant brainwashing white people undergo to make them feel guilty for black failures.  Surely you are aware that blacks are elevated by the media to the status of kings and queens while whites are constantly disparaged. I am sick of the hatred shown toward the White race by blacks and their white enablers, and I am sick of being told by people like you that any negative reference to blacks is improper. By referring to the bulked-up, misshapen, probably steroid-saturated brute Serena Williams as I did, I am merely restoring the balance, and I am trying to open  the eyes of  poor, brainwashed White people and make them see blacks as they really are, not as the media want us to see them. <br>
As for my little comment having an adverse effect on prospective Amren adherents, let&rsquo;s get real.  People are not attracted or repelled by the comments they read here.  What influences people to become race realists is their daily experience  of living among blacks, and seeing  the savage behavior of so many blacks, and that savagery was prominently displayed by Williams in her reaction to a fair and just call by an umpire. Every day White people are intimidated and terrorized, or worse, by blacks who act the way Williams did. Let us stop being intimidated by brutes like Williams, who rule by violence and threats. And let us stop being intimidated by leftists who lecture us about what is proper, while they impose their Marxist agenda on us. </p>

		<p>Typical black behaviour, they are always crying &#8220;unfair&#8221; and throw temper tantrums. They are the biggest babies when they do not get their way. It&rsquo;s time we stopped coldding the black race and make them rise (yeah right) or fall on their own merits.</p>
