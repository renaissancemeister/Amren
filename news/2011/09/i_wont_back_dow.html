			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A South Carolina woman has said she will continue to fly the Confederate flag outside her home, despite heavy opposition from the predominantly black neighbourhood where she lives.</p>
<p>Annie Chambers Caddell has been criticised by neighbours who have protested outside her house and built a large wooden fence around her property in Summersville in an attempt to obstruct the flag.</p>
<p>But she said that she will not remove the flag because she is not a racist, but &#8216;loves her heritage&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A year ago, dozens marched to protest the flying of the flag from her porch in the historically black Southern neighborhood.</p>
<p>After someone threw a rock at her porch, she put up a wooden lattice. That was just the start of the building.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, two solid eight-foot high wooden fences were built on either side of Ms Caddell&rsquo;s modest brick house to shield the Southern banner from view.</p>
<p>Late this summer, Ms Caddell raised a flagpole higher than the fences to display the flag. Then a similar pole with an American flag was placed across the fence in the yard of neighbor Patterson James, who is black.</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years after the Civil War began about 20 miles away in Charleston Harbor, fights continue over the meaning of the Confederate flag.</p>
<p>Some see it as a symbol of slavery and racism; others like Caddell say it&rsquo;s part of their Southern heritage.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m here to stay. I didn&rsquo;t back down and because I didn&rsquo;t cower the neighbors say I&rsquo;m the lady who loves her flag and loves her heritage,&rsquo; said the 51-year old who moved into the historically black Brownsville neighborhood in the summer of 2010. Her ancestors fought for the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Last October, about 70 people marched in the street and sang civil rights songs to protest the flag, while about 30 others stood in Caddell&rsquo;s yard waving the Confederate flag.</p>
<p>Opponents of the flag earlier gathered 200 names on a protest petition and took their case to a town council meeting where Caddell tearfully testified that she&rsquo;s not a racist.</p>
<p>Local officials have said she has the right to fly the flag, while her neighbors have the right to protest. And build fences.</p>
<p>&#8216;Things seemed to quiet down and then the fences started,&rsquo; Ms Caddell said.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t know anything about it until they were putting down the postholes and threw it together in less than a day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aaron Brown, the town councilman whose district includes Brownsville, said neighbors raised money for the fences.</p>
<p>&#8216;The community met and talked about the situation,&rsquo; he said. &#8216;Somebody suggested that what we should do is just go ahead and put the fences up and that way somebody would have to stand directly in front of the house to see the flag and that would mediate the flag&rsquo;s influence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Caddell isn&rsquo;t bothered by the fences and said they even seem to draw more attention to her house.</p>
<p>&#8216;People driving by here because of the privacy fences, they tend to slow down,&rsquo; she said. &#8216;If the objective was to block my house from view, they didn&rsquo;t succeed very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Confederate flag remains a sensitive issue in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The battle emblem of the Confederacy had flown on the dome of the Statehouse in Columbia since the Civil War centennial in the 1960s when state lawmakers voted in 2000 to move it to a Confederate monument in front of the building.</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has waged a tourism boycott on the state since then as it seeks to have the flag removed from the Statehouse grounds.</p>
<p>Ms Caddell, Mr Brown and Mr James all say things have been quiet in Brownsville in recent months.</p>
<p>&#8216;She&rsquo;s got a right to do what she wants to do,&rsquo; Mr James said. &#8216;That&rsquo;s all I really have to say. She can do what she wants to do in her yard, but I don&rsquo;t share her beliefs.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Miss Caddell is very courageous.</p>
<p>First, she did not, and it looks like will not, back down to the Blacks that want to violate her freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Two, she lives in a predominately Black neighborhood. Some people would call her crazy. No matter what I would NEVER live in a predominately Black neighborhood unless I was forced to because of a financial situation.</p>
<p>This article also proves Blacks do not believe in freedom of expression  &mdash;  that is, freedom of expression for White people.</p>

		<p>I would tell then &#8220;thanks&#8221; for the partial security of the fences. Good fences usually make good neighbors. Both (particularly)when living among other races and in general. At least they didn&rsquo;t try to force a false sense of brotherhood on her.</p>

		<p>Just figures that blacks make a huge issue out of a flag.  Never mind incredibly high levels of unemployment and social pathologies-&#8220;racism&#8221; in all of it&rsquo;s forms must first and last be continously fought against.  Again, dwelling on relatively trivial issues on who wants to fly a flag, will probably make more whites begin to question the overall intelligence levels and motivation levels of blacks.  After having to deal with blacks for a long time, I certainly know where I stand.</p>

		<p>They always fought for freedom of speech and expression as well<br>
as the 1st amendment itself. T-shirts with incredibly outrageous racist comments have been the vogue for decades for &#8220;fashionable black clothing&#8221;. &#8220;It&rsquo;s a black thing..you wouldn&rsquo;t understand&#8221; comes to mind as a particularly disgusting, stupid example. Like&hellip;why the hell would I WANT to understand.  Now that their own ox is being gored (hopefully), all bets on the Constitution are off. Their hypocrisy is contemptible. Their true shallow, selfish convictions are on display.</p>

Today, after work, I stopped to see my sister who is in the hospital following surgery. It&rsquo;s a Catholic hospital but I was stunned to see how many Muslim women were working there. I could spot the females because of their scarves but I suspect some of the Arab men I saw were Muslims as well.</p>
<p>This Catholic hospital is in my neighborhood so it was a short walk home. On the way, I passed houses with loud Hispanic family members shouting to each other down the street.</p>
<p>I turned on to the main thoroughfare on which a bar had been flying a Confederate flag.</p>
<p>They have taken the flag down. It was up all summer and I had seen it less than a week ago.</p>
<p>A local politician has an office within view. I don&rsquo;t know if it was taken down voluntarily or under pressure but it&rsquo;s now gone. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s too bad really, if she said she was a racist(even though she isn&rsquo;t) then they would have left probably left her alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&rsquo;m a racist - so what?  What are YOU going to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing the real anti-white racists can say to that.  I use it myself despite not hating or looking down on anyone due to their race.  It&rsquo;s very effective.  It also beats going through the mental equivalent of slamming your face repeatedly into a brick wall - talking to liberals.</p>

		<p>She only first moved into a predominantly Black neighborhood in 2010, then raised the Confederate flag??? While I admire anyone who doesn&rsquo;t back down to the forces of &#8220;PC,&#8221; this seems a whole lot like someone just asking for trouble(or looking for attention). Any White woman who moves into such a neighborhood in the first place may be in need of serious reality check as it is. I don&rsquo;t know about this one&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I purchased my home in Summerville because it was similar to my grandmother&rsquo;s home she had before Hurricane Hugo destroyed it and if any of you negative ignorant in grates had a clue what it means to stand on firm grounds with your beliefs and damned the cost maybe the fences would not went up and most of you would not be so up in arms over my confederate flag<br>
1. You must lift your eyes to see the flags<br>
2.These do not impede your views any shape size or form<br>
3.The flags do not create a dangerous situation<br>
4.Those fences create a blind spot not only for my driveway does so for my neighbors on the other side<br>
5.News Flash You looked at those eye sores you call a fence lately?<br>
Let me reassure Town of Summerville and especially Code Department&hellip;Should anyone leaving my driveway get injured over your lack of duty in this issue I can and will take you to court I filed a complaint and several people have attempted to get you off your behinds to access the situation and you &#8216;The NAACP&hellip;&#8221; I. can assure you that when the chips fall they will not be there for Summerville </p>

		<p>&#8220;But she said that she will not remove the flag because she is not a racist, but &lsquo;loves her heritage&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>We make a mistake to thrash about in the net of our adversaries&rsquo; terminology, while they look on with enjoyment at our futile efforts to defend ourselves against terms that are impossibly loaded against us.</p>
<p>She should instead eschew the term &#8220;racist&#8221; altogether, and impose her OWN terminology by stating that she will not bow to the demands of &#8220;the ANTI-WHITES&#8221;! </p>
<p>This technique has been used very successfully by a group who call themselves the bugsters&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;and it has resulted in our adversaries thrashing around in the net of OUR terminology as they immediately switch over to trying to defend themselves against our charges of being &#8220;anti-White.&#8221; MUCH better! </p>
<p>This is part of an integrated body of technique developed by the very brilliant, and very experienced (in government), Bob Whitaker.</p>
<p>IMO Mr. Whitaker has completely solved the problem that we have posted about for years here: what to do when accused of being a racist.</p>
<p>Many more bugsters are needed, and I urge anyone who thinks they may be interested to check out the link above to the thread where the bugsters loosely &#8220;coordinate&#8221; their frontline activity, and to check out the many other pages on Whitaker&rsquo;s site that explain their activities:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitakeronline.org/blog/forum/bugs-swarm/" rel="nofollow">https://www.whitakeronline.org/blog/forum/bugs-swarm/</a></p>
<p>The bugsters focus on implanting in the public mind the theme of White genocide:</p>
<p><i>Everybody says there is this RACE problem. Everybody says this RACE problem will be solved when the third world pours into EVERY white country and ONLY into white countries.</i></p>
<p>The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.</p>
<p>Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to &ldquo;assimilate,&rdquo; i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.</p>
<p>What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?</p>
<p>How long would it take anyone to realize I&rsquo;m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?</p>
<p>And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn&rsquo;t object to this?</p>
<p>But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.</p>
<p>They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white.</p>
<p>Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitakeronline.org/blog/the-white-mantra/" rel="nofollow">https://www.whitakeronline.org/blog/the-white-mantra/</a></p>
<p>The bugsters constantly develop variations of that basic &#8220;mantra,&#8221; such as these recent posts in MSM:</p>
<p><i>Nobody is saying that Africa needs diversity.</i></p>
<p>Nobody is saying that Asia needs diversity. </p>
<p>They are already 100% diverse. </p>
<p>People are only telling white children in white countries that they need diversity. </p>
<p>Canada will be 100% diverse when there are no white people left.</p>
<p>Diversity is a code-word for white genocide.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><i>African countries for Africans.<br>
Asian countries for Asians.<br>
Israel for Jews or you&rsquo;re an anti-semite!<br>
White countries for everyone or you&rsquo;re a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews!</i></p>
<p>The first post above was actually a recitation delivered in a classroom in Canada by a student who stood up and spoke it after &#8220;The asian girl gets up&hellip;and says that Canada is a multicultural nation and that our Canadian heritage videos do not reflect this diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Central to Whitaker&rsquo;s technique is the repeating of key phrases such as, &#8220;White genocide,&#8221; &#8220;Anti-White,&#8221; and especially, &#8220;Anti-racist is just a code word for anti-White.&#8221; The idea is to root these phrases in the public psyche in the same manner as effective phrases in commercial advertising have been rooted (I&rsquo;m an oldster, so I think of &#8220;Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should,&#8221; which worked very well for Winston cigarettes!), and as anti-White phrases like &#8220;racist,&#8221; &#8220;bigot,&#8221; &#8220;hate,&#8221; etc. have been rooted in the public mind by ceaseless repetition by our institutions.</p>
<p>Check it out at my first link above, and just jump right in as I did! You&rsquo;ll get helpful corrections from the other bugsters, and you&rsquo;ll probably have as much fun as I&rsquo;m having there!</p>

		<p>In the rural South it is not uncommon to see Black and whites livng as neighbors. In many areas blacks outnumber Whites as much as five to one.After the war between the states blacks were able to buy their former slave house and a few acres of land that surrounded the main house. In areas where coal was mined the coal companies built houses for their workers. Whites lived on one side of the road and Blacks on the other. After the mines were closed the families were able to buy their house at a cheap price.Blacks and Whites have a long history of living together in the South in peace until recently.The civil rights movement of the sixties destroyed that.</p>

How can that be? How were former black slaves able to buy anything? We are told we OWE them everything. They all need reparations now, don&rsquo;t they? Why don&rsquo;t these peaceful blacks you talk about SPEAK OUT? I have my doubts about the &#8220;peaceful&#8221; blacks back then. </p>

<p>&#8220;Today, after work, I stopped to see my sister who is in the hospital following surgery. It&rsquo;s a Catholic hospital but I was stunned to see how many Muslim women were working there. I could spot the females because of their scarves but I suspect some of the Arab men I saw were Muslims as well.</p>
<p>This Catholic hospital is in my neighborhood so it was a short walk home. &#8220;</p>
<p>I would think that this is not unusual when an old Catholic (or whatever denomination based) hospital is located in a Muslim settled area.  I know of a Jewish woman who had a baby at a Mercy Hospital in Wisconsin 59 years ago.  The Catholic Church has hospitals located all over the globe.  They still hope to convert the remainder of the world that they haven&rsquo;t yet.  The alternative is to shut it down, I guess?  Hospitals make money, and exist to make money, regardless of the details. The problem is that so many Muslims are being allowed into the U.S., not that they supply a cheaper labor base.  Still, If I had to choose, I&rsquo;d rather be treated by an Arab trained nurse than a Mexican or black one because Arabs have a long history of medical practice and competence.</p>

		<p>A few times when I&rsquo;ve done what I considered to be defending myself, objecting to black behavior, against black men it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily thought of that way by the police. Not all white men are weaklings or afraid of confrontation, please don&rsquo;t paint us all as such. The situation isn&rsquo;t always so cut and dried.</p>
<p>In addition to that sentiment, there aren&rsquo;t many white women who stand up for white rights. Usually it seems to be the opposite from my experience. A few examples doesn&rsquo;t prove a trend.</p>

		<p>This woman may be foolish and relish a fight, but at least she has the courage of her convictions.  I&rsquo;ve asked honest questions of persons, some who likely frequent this page, and they decline to clarify their beliefs or give a basis for their thinking.  People outside your inner circle who are learning and reshaping their own worldview will be hardpressed to obtain real answers from the brave people in these forums or on facebook.  There are only a few persons willing to openly discuss issues, and likely less than a handful brave enough for even the smallest action.  Probably because they sense that they would stand alone publicly.  So, although this woman is likely endagering herself, at least she is doing something, which is preferable to hiding out among like-minded people.</p>

<p>Your point is prescient.  Politicians nationally used to like to use &#8220;neighborhood schools&#8221; as a circumlouction for opposing forced school busing and deseg for racial reasons.  However, &#8220;neighborhood schools&#8221; is not understood as such by whites in the Deep South, because residential patters are so mixed.  In order to have school segregation in Mississippi, you needed de jure segregation.  Brown v Board in 1954 heavily affected the deep south first, however, because cities outside the Deep South were self-segregated by residential patterns, they weren&rsquo;t affected by deseg until the Federal judiciary started ordering busing schemes.</p>

		<p>I live in a persian nieghborhood.  One of my neighbors owns a store in a tourist area that sells nothing but flags and clothes with flags on them.  The flags are of all sizes from tiny little ones to the big 4 by 8 ones. The store is in California.  Many of the toursists are from Europe and specially Asia, Asia more than Europe.</p>
<p>One day he brought one of the tiny little flags to me. He told me it was the best selling flag in his store. He couldn&rsquo;t keep it in stock. What was this flag?</p>
<p>It was a Confederate flag.</p>
<p>The tourists know nothing about the history of the Confederate flag but they love the design and colors.  Isn&rsquo;t it actually the Confederate battle flag?</p>
<p>Anaylzing the flag with an artist&rsquo;s eye it is easy to see why it is his best seller.  First the colors.  Men like the blue shades, women like the red and pink shades so the color scheme appeals to both.  Red and blue are a classic combination, much more attractive than green and red which is also popular.</p>
<p>Then that X shaped cross is very important.  An X shape in any form of art is more appealiing that a simple cross becase an X shape is very dynamic.  The X also sets up a symetrical harmony that is less boring and more attractive than simple squares.</p>
<p>Thought any southerners might like to know that persian souvenir shop owners  and asian tourists love the Confederate flag.</p>
