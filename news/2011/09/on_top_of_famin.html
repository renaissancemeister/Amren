<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} As Somalis stream across the border into Kenya, at a rate of about 1,000 a day, they are frequently prey to armed bandits who rob men and rape women in the 50-mile stretch before they reach Dadaab, now the world&rsquo;s largest refugee camp.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know how many women are raped because the subject is taboo. But more than half of the newly arrived Somalis I interviewed, mostly with the help of CARE, said they had been attacked by bandits, sometimes in Somalia but very often on Kenyan soil. Some had been attacked two or three times.</p>
<p>In short, this seems like an instance of mass rape   &mdash;   adding one more layer of misery to the world&rsquo;s most desperate humanitarian crisis. The United Nations warns that750,000 Somalis are at risk of starving to death in the coming months, and it&rsquo;s increasingly clear that those who try to save themselves and their children must endure a gantlet of robbers and rapists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For unmarried women, rapes often involve tearing and physical injuries. That&rsquo;s because Somali girls often undergo an extreme kind of genital cutting, infibulation, that involves slicing off the genitals and sewing up the vagina with a wild thorn.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;involves slicing off the genitals and sewing up the vagina with a wild thorn.&#8221;<br>
Not sewing, using several thorns to sort of pin what is left together.</p>
<p>Tomorrow there will be a desparate plea by the NYSlimes and various Christian churches to bring these women to America where they will all go on welfare and spend their days sueing everyone who looks at them for discrimination against women who wear those muslim shroud and veil outfits.</p>
<p>Then they will get affirmative action jobs at every goverment agency in town while remaining on welfare of course.</p>
<p>Somali and Ethopia can only sustain so many people.  With singer Bono and the rest of the useful idiots feeding them for the last 40 years, their numbers have grown to the point where they need constant shipments of food aid.</p>
<p>Since TIA this is africa, Bono and the rest of the do gooders have to figure on about an 80 percent theft and spoilage loss rate.  Figure what they actually need and send then 180 percent and hope some of it gets through.</p>
<p>Every time I see one of those feed the starving african children posters I see the boys in 10 years time; bloodthirsty mass murderers and gang rapists. <br>

		<p>Here in Washington state, we have a coyote overpopulation problem.  Does the state earmark free food for coyotes?  No it mandates that anyone who has passed a hunter safety course can shoot a coyote anywhere in the state, because the numbers need to be checked.</p>
<p>Wisconsin has a feral cat problem.  Do they set aside free food for feral cats?  Well I&rsquo;m sure there are some animal-rights idiots who would try, but no last I heard there was talk about licensing hunters to shoot them.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not suggesting tags need to be issued to shoot Somalis, only pointing out that this is a man-made problem created by artificially supporting a population beyond the abilities of the land upon which they live, and the solution is not to uphold the conditions that caused the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>Removing the subsidy causes mass death and the bleeding hearts will never let 750,000 Somalis starve on their watch.  So they&rsquo;ll import as many as they can (as though we don&rsquo;t have problems of our own) and send as much food as they can for the rest, exacerbating the problem.</p>
<p>More government solutions to government-created problems.</p>

<p>Here we go again. The U.N. says&hellip;&hellip;this is an excuse to bring in millions more Somali women and children to ONLY White nations.. Right? How many YEARS has this been going on? Is it OUR problem or our moral duty to bring them all here?  NO, a million times, NO! </p>
<p>These people just bring their problems and practices with them wherever they go. I really do not care about the Somalis, the Africans, the haitians, the Indonesians, or any other nonwhite people of the world.</p>
<p> We have already seen these people up close and personal for eons now and they never change. They DESTROY their own in their home countries and then come here to destroy US! I pray we have learned our lesson by now, but I am afraid far too many White traitors will override any concern we have and bring them in anyway.</p>

<p>Now you did it! I am a cat lover (no, I am NOT an idiot, thank you very much) and I feed and spayed a couple of strays that I do feed. WHY does Wisconsin have such a bad problem? Is Wisconsin full of minorities? I do know that minority ridden areas have strays dogs and cats everywhere, due to their lack of love and caring for animals period. Are we, Whites,to be the same way? Please do not come on here and speak of killing any animal, especially pets (domesticated animals). It reminds me of a 3rd world country where they have no feeling for the abused pet populations in their country! Are we just like them?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a cat lover. </p>
<p>Many volunteers here in my country also take care of cats who have no home. The cats get sterilized, get all kinds of injections to keep them healthy, they get fed, and many people try to find a home for these poor animals.</p>
<p>If cat-owners would take care of the animals they have this problem would not exist. Sadly to say that some of those people just don&rsquo;t care. They let them breed and dump the kittens wherever they can. </p>
<p>I once read that a people can be judged in the way they treat their animals. I think that the last thing we need are &#8216;third world tactics&rsquo; when dealing with our furry friends.</p>

		<p>There is such an epidemic of rape in Africa that it&rsquo;s become almost normal to the mentality over there.  I was reading about the rape cases in Congo and could not believe the physical debilitation caused by the amount of rape.  It&rsquo;s like a national pastime.  The gangs of military thugs actually have different types of injuries associated with whatever gang they are part of.  One gang shoots the rape victim in the genitals or otherwise mutilates them, burns the buttocks, or somehow marks them.  These Africans don&rsquo;t discriminate on age either, they even rape infants - something truly savage.  That actually casts any human into another category.  I would really be hard pressed to find similar statistics, ever, in any part of the history of all the European peoples or white diaspora.  The girls and children are raped so often and so brutally they have internal fistulas (breakdown of tissue between organs such as the large intestine and vagine, in this case but a fistula can be any tissue compromise) which really is unheard of ever in the West, in my view.  Read about it on Unamusement Park (or maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t!).  Actually, it&rsquo;s quite sobering to be aware of what levels can be descended to.  It is unfortunately a lesson libs will only learn when the hordes are actually bearing down on them.  These are monsters, not men. </p>

		<p>Dear Wisconsin - the state where blacks attack whites at the state fair?<br>
  don&rsquo;t shoot the cats, offer free sterilization to all cats and immigrants illegal or not.<br>
 as a matter of fact, if you can catch a Somalian etc - let the vet sterilize them, after all it&rsquo;s a step up from their own culturally colorful and rich society.</p>

		<p>This shows you what the real character of black Africans is like, unmodereated, natural behavior - with no evil whitey pulling the strings and egging things on, but no doubt as I write various lefties are formulating all sorts of tortuous theories with whitey being placed somewhere at the center of the web as the evil genius orchestrating the atrocities.<br>
  Back to my main point.This is what black Africans do - the way they treat the wretched and the vunerable (they are seen as just another &#8216;business opportunity&rsquo;).If they behave like that in nature, why are the gullible shocked when they see what they do when imported into the west?</p>

<p>I completely agree with you. It is shameful for white communities to even discuss slaughtering domestic pets simply because the are too lazy, or too uncaring to put human spay/neuter procedures in place.</p>
<p>Pet populations can be easily controlled with responsible ownership and inexpensive programs aimed at controlling the populations. Anyone that relishes the idea of shooting helpless domestic pets for fun, when they are not a threat to lives or property, is someone with a real mean streak.</p>

		<p>Unspeakable?  Really?  Then why do we hear about it day in and day out without break?  I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s unspeakable. It&rsquo;s the genetic predisposition of the savage rapists toward committing these acts of horrendous violence. It&rsquo;s the same kind of savagery we&rsquo;re now seeing on the streets of America, now that blacks feel free to act as their instincts tell them to. That, people, is the unspeakable part&hellip;</p>

<p><br>
In the Afro-Muslim part of the world, there needn&rsquo;t be any refugee crisis going on for this to happen. There, the crudest, most unhygienic clitoridectomies are merely Standard Operating Procedure. The current rape epidemic might be (slightly) out of the ordinary, but FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) is as common in their &#8220;societies&#8221; as male circumcision is in ours. </p>

<p>I disagree. A people are judged on how they treat their babies. Why are white people so concerned about stray cats and dogs, but are indifferent to the millions of white babies who are aborted each year in America and Europe? If I could trade the lives of 1000 stray cats, in order to save the life of one white baby from being aborted, that would be a fair trade for me.<br>

<p>Here is a link for the spay, neuter, release society. The ONLY humane thing to do. The animal shelters are overflowing and lack funds. If a cat cannot breed more litters, (through neutering and spaying) then that is the only way to go. I shop at PetSmart and to see those cats in the cages up for adoptions everyday is heartbreaking to me. I go &#8220;talk&#8221; to them everytime, hoping they know they are loved by someone. This doesn&rsquo;t have to happen in the first place.</p>

		<p>Original poster of the misunderstood cat comment here:</p>
<p>Seems that filthy half-wild animals have completely derailed the discussion over the overpopulation of East Africa. Leave it to Whites to get their emotions all knotted up over cats and totally miss the point.</p>
<p>This is the exact same misplaced altruistic do-gooderness that&rsquo;s left us up to our necks in third-worlders, just re-directed toward animals that hold more sway over people&rsquo;s emotions than their fellow man does.  </p>
<p>For God&rsquo;s sake we can&rsquo;t deny the cats (or Africans) their rights.  We must open the doors of America to feral cats (or Africans) because it would break our tender hearts to see them go hungry.  Other people&rsquo;s money must be set aside to deal with this problem as ineffectively as possible, and it absolutely MUST NOT actually solve any problem.</p>
<p>The farmers losing small animals, upland hunters having to deal with the pressure these animals place on bird populations and  people who have to clean up the garbage these starving cats spread all over because the ecosystem can&rsquo;t support their numbers, they all thank you for your noble efforts.</p>
<p>People who come on this site and foam at the mouth over government monies spent on non-whites then champion government monies spent to improve the lot of wild cats are missing a few screws. </p>
<p>Here, go crazy over this:</p>

		<p>The African predilection for demented violence never ceases to amaze me. I&rsquo;ve been following these horrific stories for years now and just when I think I have heard everything, a new act of animal cruelty occurs that tops them all. A good book to read if you want some pre-Marxist views on the rise of Shaka Zulu is &#8220;The Washing of the Spears&#8221;. It covers the known history of the Zulu kingdom from the early 18th through the early 19th Century. You get impalements, women having unborn children cut-out, people executed for the crimes of coughing or involuntary laughter&hellip;. When one Zulu faction destroys a rival faction it wipes them out root and branch-warriors, women, children-all slain. </p>
<p>It is striking when you compare African savagery to the actions of &#8216;barbarians&rsquo; that once roamed Europe, but it does not compare. Whether Goth, Vandal, Saxon, or Frank their crimes-all recorded by their mortal enemies-never sink to the level of sub-Saharan Africans. I recall reading that when Alaric sacked Rome in 410 AD, his followers maintained the sanctity of holy sites, even though the clergy of Rome were from a rival sect of Christianity. Forty thousand wild Goths could plunder a city, but manage to maintain enough discipline to not loot the churches! Can you imagine something like this restraint happening in modern Africa, or inner-city Detroit? </p>

		<p>&#8220;I disagree. A people are judged on how they treat their babies. Why are white people so concerned about stray cats and dogs, but are indifferent to the millions of white babies who are aborted each year in America and Europe? If I could trade the lives of 1000 stray cats, in order to save the life of one white baby from being aborted, that would be a fair trade for me&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Do you include being against non-white abortions. Because, if so, count me out. You may believe it is against God&rsquo;s will, but many of us could careless about some Middle Eastern tribal deity. I am concerned with my White brothers and sisters, period. Nobody else!<br>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that Nafissatou Diallo, the African hotel maid who falsely accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of rape, was coached by an immigration lawyer to claim gang rape in Guinea as grounds for asylum in the US.  She claimed many African women were given audio-taped accounts of rapes to memorize, so that they could lie convincingly to immigration judges.  She became a bit of a false-rape accusation expert as a result!<br>

<p>No it is NOT the same. Domestic cats were brought on ships by the earliest settlers and have been companion animals and farm helpers for centuries in America.</p>
<p>No one is suggesting we should let them breed at will and let them take over hte country, and those that want to SHOOT them are the same folks that won&rsquo;t spend a DIME to spay or neuter any!  I would say the people that laugh at the pain of animals are the real problem because THEY are the ones that refuse to put sensible laws and rules in place that prevents the awful abuse of homeless pets.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about Europe, but Whites have the lowest abortion rates in America.  That is because we use birth control and are the least promiscous women in America.</p>
<p>Hispanic and black women, often very young girls have most of the abortions. I respect your position on abortion. But please do not include White women as having a lot of abortions because we don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>The Portuguese sold guns to the African chiefs 550 years ago.  The Portuguese taught them to shoot using targets.  The chiefs trained their soldiers to shoot using human targets.  The targets were not criminals or prisoners of war, just ordinary members of the tribe.  Not slaves of course as they were property and worth something.<br>

		<p>When I was at Bristol University (England) someone wrote a thesis on cats and birds.  He went to a small town and offered a bounty to every cat owner who brought him a dead bird the cat had dragged home.</p>
<p>In just 1 year in that small town it was 12 thousand birds. Those were just the birds the cats brought home.</p>
<p>My parents had 3 acres, a big garden, rasberry bushes and an mixed orchard, cherries in May and June, then various kinds of plums, then apples and pears in September.</p>
<p>The dang birds ate the rasberries and pecked holes in the fruit.<br>
I often wished our cats would stake out the rasberry bushes.</p>
<p>I think that animal loving is a much better way to vent altruism than this criminal and non White immigrant from the most savage and ignorant societies on earth loving insanity.  </p>
<p>Animal lovers don&rsquo;t hurt Whites all that much.  They balance each other out.  In Marin county Ca there is an on going fight between the &#8220;dogs must run free&#8221; anti leash law people and the deer lovers who are distressed that the ridgebacks, shepherds rotts and dobermans who run wild all day run down and eat the deer while the deer are still alive.</p>
<p>In coastal areas there are fights between the endangered bird lovers and fox lovers.  The parks want to kill the foxes who are killing the egrets and other rare species.  The fox lovers don&rsquo;t want their beloved icons killed.</p>
<p>Animal lover lobbies are not harmful to White interest.  Immigration lover lobbies are.</p>

When you refer to people from Africa could you be more specific please</p>
<p>Broad brush: </p>
<p>north of the Sahara they are Arabic; </p>
<p>south of the Sahara they are BLACK African</p>
<p>in the far south there are about 4 to 5 million whites - born and raised on the continent who consider themselves African in the same way that white caucasians in the USA consider themselves American. Indeed, the word Afrikaner actually means African<br>
Also in Southern Africa you have the Khoi-Khoi (Hottentot) and San (Bushmen) people. They are small brown skinned people.</p>
<p>This thread is addressing the behaviour of BLACK Africans and we should clearly state this and not generalise by referring to them as Africans. <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>Bishop Tutu likes to pull the wool over the eyes of the idiotic liberals in the west who swoon at his every utterance. One of of his pet subjects is the Black African concept of Ubuntu - in short; caring, sharing, brotherly love. </p>
<p>Google Wikipedia - Tutu/Ubuntu to read all about it</p>
<p>How he can reconcile this with the savagery that is the reality of Black Africa is a mystery to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps he is so desperate to use his celebrity to portray a good image of black Africans that he is prepared to say anything.<br>
In his own country - South Africa - black Africans have killed 300,000 of their own and 40,000 whites since attaining their &#8220;freedom&#8221; when apartheid ended in 1990. <br>

<p>It is encouraging to see more Americans waking up to the reality of Africa south of the Sahara.</p>

<p>The figures you quote actually refer to just one country - Ethiopia </p>
<p>Irish journalist Kevin Myers reveals these statistics in an article about this called:</p>
<p>Africa Has Given The World Nothing But Aids </p>
<p>For telling the truth the left wing media rounded on him and laid a charge of Hate Speech and Incitement against him.<br>
Check it out on Wikipedia<br>

<p>As other readers have pointed out - it is unlikely that we will see African countries coming to the aid of their brothers.</p>
<p>It makes a mockery of ex South African President Thabo Mbeki&rsquo;s mantra:</p>
<p>African Solutions for African Problems.</p>
<p>The west really should back off and let nature take its course</p>
<p>If the Geldorf/Bono do-gooders really want to throw money at Africa they should target it at educational programs</p>
<p>Teach the people to look after themselves and free the west from this financial burden of saving lives who go on to create more non-producers<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>And finally for the animal lovers;</p>
<p>With all this aid going to Africa and increasing the human population, the knock-on affect is that animal habitats are diminishing as more space is required to house humans and grow their crops. In parts of Africa where black Africans are too lazy to grow crops, or have to wait for their crops to grow, they resort to eating the wildlife in what is known as the bush meat trade.</p>
<p>Harsh as it may sound white Christian westerners are actually upsetting the balance of nature in Africa with their compassionate policies and aid campaigns.</p>

<p>EXACTLY, poster. I also am only concerned with my White brothers and sisters. They are my family. An extended family. Race trumps all. But most Whites are slow learners of this fact.</p>
<p>That is where OUR altruism is suppose to be directed towards. OUR OWN RACE. Not to blacks or any other race. I believe God approves.</p>
