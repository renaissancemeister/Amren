<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police are asking for the public&rsquo;s help tracking down a large group of violent teenagers.</p>
<p>They say 10 to 15 young people  &mdash;  described as black or Hispanic and both male and female  &mdash;  attacked four white men on the 16th Street Mall at about 10:45 p.m. on Sunday.</p>
<p>Denver police say the men were standing on the mall near Arapahoe when they were approached by the group. After a conversation, the group turned violent and they attacked the men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really unclear as to what their motivation was  &mdash;  why such a large group of young people came together and assaulted these individuals,&#8221; said Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson.</p>
<p>Authorities say the attacks could have been gang related or racially motivated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2009 a similar series of attacks took place near downtown, on the 16th Street Mall and in surrounding areas. The victims were usually white or Hispanic and the suspects were black. Surveillance video captured one of the attacks on camera.</p>
<p>Many of those arrested in connection with the assaults were known to have ties with street gangs. Police said some or all of those attacks may have a kind of gang initation.</p>

		<p>&#8221;.. 15 blacks and Hispanics randomly attacked four whites.&#8221;</p>
<p>If there were Hispanics involved, I&rsquo;d venture to say they were a rarity, because they&rsquo;re usually the victims of blacks, not their cohorts in beat downs.</p>
<p>Too, who knows?  The liberal presstitutes might have falsely included &#8220;Hispanics,&#8221; when there was just one rogue renegade involved, because the presstitutes will bend over backwards to prevent assigning blame to blacks if they can divert it somehow, ignore it, or water it down a bit, giving the impression it is not just &#8220;blacks&#8221; that are involved.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting worse since Obama has been in office.</p>

No it isn&rsquo;t. As a matter of fact, after all the flashmobs and black on white beatings over the summer it&rsquo;s perfectly clear what the motivation was and ya&rsquo;ll ain&rsquo;t fooling anybody anymore with your fake perplexity. </p>

		<p>Read the comments in the original article. I am surprised that CBS Local Denver allowed those comments. My local newspaper would have deleted such blunt rhetoric.</p>
<p>When developers (either private or public) conceive a project, they do it with white people in mind. This can be any development - a mall, pedestrian shopping street, a public plaza, town square, entertainment district with bars and dance clubs - the developers and investors do not consider the possibility of large numbers of black people using the area. The developers only envision white people using the area. If developers want an area to be open to all people, they will have to hire a large number of security guards to control the segment of the &#8220;youth&#8221; most likely to act violently.</p>
<p>In short, places (and rules) designed with white people in mind do not work with black people.<br>

		<p>An irony of this episode is that, no matter how Denver PD categorizes the Hispanic hate criminals, somewhere between 90% and 100% will be categorized as &#8220;white hate criminals&#8221; when the hate crime stats are published for 2011.</p>
<p>This has been explained over and over, but the basic idea is that hate crime assailants are categorized by race: black, white, red, and yellow.</p>
<p>Hispanics are an ethnic groups, although a demographic that can claim its own hate crime victims, but is never charged in Washington with hate crimes themselves.</p>

The police have been told by the representatives of the ADL and SPLC that blacks can&rsquo;t be racists and that blacks don&rsquo;t commit hate crimes.</p>
<p>Since the police know these two facts from their ADL/SPLC required tolerance classes, it&rsquo;s not surprising the police can&rsquo;t find a motive. </p>

		<p>I am around a lot of hispanics all the time.  While there is a strong anti-black sentiment among a lot of them, there are also some latino subgroups who idolize blacks, much like our own w*****s.  Most Dominicans alternate between gangsta rap and their Spanish versions of it.  Some Mexicans really get into rap also, and they look to blacks as role models.  </p>

		<p>Mulatto Carribean Hispanic subgroups like Puerto Ricans and Dominicans hang out a lot with blacks, imitate them, and even look like them.  Generally both groups are considered violent, more than the usually docile Mexicans.  I doubt Mexicans would roam around with blacks, but I could see Carribean Hispanics participating in this.  </p>

		<p>Here in Oakland, black teens are shooting latino working guys and even latino children. You have to read between the lines to see the trend. A black columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle just noted it in a recent column. A group of three black teens just shot a guy who was gardening because they wanted his ipod and necklace. They were caught when one of the teens bragged about killing the victim. The depravity is escalating in the black community. I was mugged in January a block from my house when 2 black kids, who have been invited by my clueless school district to go to a school near my home in Alameda, followed me from a bus stop and attacked me, knocking me down and stealing my purse and groceries. I was also the victim of a sexual assault by a group of black teens at a BART station. I was waiting for a bus with my mom when a group of black teens came and started darting in and groping my private parts whilst I and my mom tried to fight them off. I can also tell you that I have seen countless racist incidents during my lifetime growing up in Oakland and all but 3 were perpetrated by blacks against other races.</p>

		<p>My neighbor just had a guy house sit for her. He was walking in the marina district in San Francisco when he was knocked out and woke up with a gang member beating the stuff out of him. His neck was broken. He is a competitive windsurfer and conga drummer and was partially paralyzed by gang bangers who were doing an initiation beat down. Another neighbor was walking in Oakland when a group of black teens came up and started beating him and said, &#8220;Bitch, give us your wallet.&#8221; So 3 of us were the victims of muggings in 3 different cities in the bay area. I also was a witness to a shooting and my sister was a witness to a shooting that resulted in murder. In fact, one day I was walking to work in Oakland and as I passed the post office a woman was telling her husband over a cell phone where he could find a parking space  &#8220;There&rsquo;s a spot right where Chauncy got killed,&#8221; she said. (Chauncy Bailey was a local journalist who ran afoul of local black muslims and was murdered) </p>

		<p>Answer to the Canadian commenting above. Yes some of us have guns. I do and I am glad it wasn&rsquo;t in my purse when I got mugged, because the teens who mugged me would have a gun now. Besides, if I, a white woman, shot 2 Black teens for &#8220;merely&#8221; mugging me, I would end up in jail for sure. Their families would lay it on thick about they were honor students and would never mug anyone. They would claim I made up the part about getting mugged and that I shot the kids because I&rsquo;m scared of innocent black people. The truth is the absolute opposite, I was so used to seeing black teens in hoodies I didn&rsquo; t pay any attention to them at all. I also live in a nice neighborhood, where I should be safe. It&rsquo;s just that our school district has open enrollment for criminals from Oakland and Richmond. The criminal students think we&rsquo;re chumps for inviting them into our nice city and treat us accordingly.</p>

<p>Many Americans have guns, and the number of Americans with Concealed Carry Permits is growing.</p>
<p>However, there are plenty of Americans who fear guns and advocate stricter gun regulations. Also, there are some rules one must abide by before brandishing, and especially firing, a gun. </p>
<p>A single unarmed teenager might not pose a lethal threat and so probably wouldn&rsquo;t warrant shooting in self-defense. A group of teenagers, maybe. But who do you shoot? And its your word against those of the kids. I hope laws will be passed to protect potential victims from criminal and civil suits for lethal force against mob attacks, regardless of the ages of the mob members.</p>

<p>In most states, there are few restrictions on purchasing guns and keeping them in your home, but the carrying of guns in public is much more strictly regulated. Most states subject that to onerous permit processes which most gun owners feel are not worth their time. Because of this, typically only a very small percentage of people in any given state are licensed to carry guns in public, even though the rate of gun ownership in many of those states may be very high. However, if black violence continues to escalate, all this may change and many more people may take the trouble to get carry permits. </p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m speaking in generalities here; there are, of course, some states which are are much more permissive or restrictive than average. If you want a good overview of state gun laws in America, these maps at opencarry.com are a good place to look. <br>

		<p>I hope the authorities were mistaken about it being a mixed black and Hispanic gang, or, at the very least, it was just one or two rogue Hispanics running with the blacks. If blacks and Hispanics are allying against us, it puts us as White people in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>On a related topic, most of us have the attitude of &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want Whites mixing with other races, but I don&rsquo;t care if different non-white races mix with each other.&#8221; That may come back to bite us if blacks and Hispanics start mixing in large numbers and produce a new dark brown race, which would combine Hispanics&rsquo; gang organization skills with blacks&rsquo; ultra-high crime rates and fondness for singling out Whites as victims.</p>
<p>We need to work on keeping our enemies divided and busy with each other. It&rsquo;s ugly business and not anything we should take pleasure in, but it is necessary for our survival as a people.</p>

Ownership is common but some states don&rsquo;t permit legal carry. Only the criminals have that right. I agree with you however. Defend your life first then worry about the consequences later.</p>

<p>Americans with CCW permits are unlikely to be hanging out in areas and at times when these black flash mobs are likely to form, not only because it&rsquo;s not their &#8220;thing&#8221; from a social standpoint, but I have found in my experience that getting a CCW permit and actually carrying has taught me how to be a good coward.  In other words, I avoid bad scenes as much as possible because I don&rsquo;t want to have to use this thing.  I&rsquo;m sure that&rsquo;s the way it is with a lot of other people with carry permits.  We wanted the power of life and death on our hips for a long time, and now we got what we wished for.  Sure, we&rsquo;d rather have it legally than not have it, but by the same token, it&rsquo;s a giant responsibility.</p>
<p>This is why I&rsquo;m not so worried about the nutbar of Iran getting a nuclear weapon.  It might turn him into a coward, too.</p>

That makes good sense.  And I agree.</p>
<p>I have known a number of police officers, who ARE authorized to carry at all times, and to use if necessary,   who have told me that they also try to avoid situations where they are likely to have to use it   &mdash;    especially if they are out somewhere with their families.  No sensible person is looking for trouble. Only thugs are looking for trouble. </p>

<p>Yes, many Americans own firearms, but those who do tend to be more realistic about crime than those who do not. As a result, you will find mostly naive, anti-gun whites walking in unsafe urban centers at night. I was born and raised in the San Francisco bay area, and I would never walk in parts of Oakland, Berkeley or San Francisco if I could avoid it. On the other hand, gang &#8220;kids&#8221; know that they must modify their behavior when they leave the city. Country folk are armed and do not put up with their nonsense. </p>

		<p>In answer to the question that most of the commenters here seem to be posing, I&rsquo;m guessing the reason none of these black and brown thugs have been killed by someone with concealed carry is because those of us smart enough to get a firearm to protect themselves from said thugs are also smart enough to stay away from the areas that contain them.</p>

		<p>I live out here and the hispanics and us whites usually get along together.  It was the blacks that attacked whites and hispanics in 2009.  I&rsquo;m betting this might be gang related?  Hispanics and blacks are the ones who don&rsquo;t get along.  The whites here and Hispanics generally get along well.</p>

I hope the authorities were mistaken about it being a mixed black and Hispanic gang, or, at the very least, it was just one or two rogue Hispanics running with the blacks. If blacks and Hispanics are allying against us, it puts us as White people in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>On a related topic, most of us have the attitude of &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Whites mixing with other races, but I don&rsquo;t care if different non-white races mix with each other.&rdquo; That may come back to bite us if blacks and Hispanics start mixing in large numbers and produce a new dark brown race, which would combine Hispanics&rsquo; gang organization skills with blacks&rsquo; ultra-high crime rates and fondness for singling out Whites as victims.</p>
<p>We need to work on keeping our enemies divided and busy with each other. It&rsquo;s ugly business and not anything we should take pleasure in, but it is necessary for our survival as a people.<br>

WOW. Good point. I, being a decent white man, never thought of it this way. I just want my culture, my people and my beautiful natural settings to remain.<br>
But since the brown world, and their white marxist controllers and funders are scheming in every possible way to divide and conquer US, isn&rsquo;t is wise to use the same tactics?<br>
It&rsquo;s just survival, after all. Not wackiness. ( I would have been content to live in a prosperous, white, liberal, forward-thinking society until I died of old age, never hurting a fly, and never thinking to block, foment, etc., the efforts of anyone else. <br>
I guess that simple, good-hearted outlook on the world wasn&rsquo;t good enough for Marxist traitors and the third world horde, who are rapacious beyond measure).<br>
Thanks for the good post!</p>

Another problem with carrying a gun in the U.S. is that there are many establishments in which a person cannot bring the weapon.  Most people walking the streets are headed for stores, public conveyances, government buildings, etc.  So, even if one can lawfully carry his gun in a car or keep it at home, he is thwarted trying to protect himself on the street while going about daily business.  </p>

		<p> I really don&rsquo;t generally see Chicanos banding with blacks to attack whites or other Hispanics. If anything, the animosity between Mexicans and blacks seems to be increasing in the Western states. Of course, Caribbean blacks, East Coast Dominicans and Puerto Ricans may be joining with blacks in criminal activities: after all, they share common African ancestors, but Mexicans, in most cases, do not.  </p>

<p>On a large scale? No. But it would not surprise me at all if there were Mexicans doing so in individual cases. In fact, there was a story posted on Amren years ago about a large group of Blacks and Mexicans at a high school in California who organized online and attacked White students in a coordinated assault.</p>

		<p>Adding to my earlier reaction to 15, the kinds of political jurisdictions where black flash mobs usually form are usually big cities, which have these things:  (A) An elected District or State&rsquo;s or Circuit Attorney that is either black or white liberal, either way, a suck up to the black voters, (B) A Police Department whose Chief is an insipid left-wing race pandering suck-up, and the Police Commissioners are generally the same, (C) A panoply of cracker jack box theology degree black preachers, and (D) A left-wing newspaper that makes every excuse in the book for black crime and failure.</p>
<p>If you try to battle a black flash mob with your 9 mm Ruger that you legally carry around with your CCW permit, expect A, B, C and D to fire back at you figuratively with everything they have.  Yeah, you might legally win in the long run, but often times the process is far more punishing than the theoretical punishment.</p>
<p>As for the politics of CCW, I have never heard of politicians who predict &#8220;wild west&#8221; (*) doom and gloom disaster ever being held to account for their paranoia when it turns out not to happen.  When Florida debated CCW, some police chiefs wanted the state to buy them fully automatic weapons because they had this odd notion that the kind of person who would go into a building full of cops to get permission to carry a concealed handgun around would then turn around and shoot cops.  As it turns out, from what I said above and the reactions in earnest, CCW does just the opposite for the most part, it turns us into &#8220;greater part of valor&#8221; discretionary cowards.  Part of the reason is that a typical CCW permit holder is a middle aged white man, who, because of race and age, doesn&rsquo;t really have a full tank, (if you know what I mean), and also enough life experience to know when to be a coward.</p>
<p>* - The &#8220;wild west&#8221; really wasn&rsquo;t wild.</p>

<p>No hyperbole here, just a gut feeling.<br>
The election of 2012, the total defeat of Obama and a Democratic Senate, will be the last act.<br>
Race war, black on white, everywhere. I think it will break out on election night, as it is clear by late afternoon Obama is squashed. The blacks and mestizos too, will set the night on fire. By morning it will be apparent we have full scale civil war.<br>
That&rsquo;s when it all crumbles, and the idiots wake up.<br>
I am not sure, nor am I happy about this feeling, nor am I crazy. But I look around at the economic and cultural destruction, and see the anger and hopelessness in whites, and the wanton  (I mean everyday) mayhem in blacks and Mestizos, who have filtered into every suburb, every town. They are all everywhere. When they strike, it will be nationwide. Every street will be a warzone, or next to one.<br>
I do not think whites will be beaten, far from it. But that will be the last day of the old order. There&rsquo;s no way to put a positive spin on columns of smoke and gunfire everywhere. </p>

		<p>Re: Carry permits: I used to live in Vermont, where there is no permit requirement to carry concealed. Violent crime in Vermont is practically non-existent. There are probably two main reasons for this. One is that the population is overwhelmingly white and the other is that a great many people are armed. It seemed ironic to me when I was there that you didn&rsquo;t need government permission to defend yourself in a state where you were unlikely to have to defend yourself.</p>

		<p>Hello. I am the Canadian reader at #15 who was curious as to why so many Americans seem to be punching bags for blacks, apparently unwilling to defend themselves. This strikes me as very strange since my understanding is that gun ownership is widespread in the USA. I remember being in western New York state once and going into a gunstore out of curiousity. I was amazed. You would NEVER see a store like that in Canada. NEVER. I would like to thank all the people who replied to my post. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about open/concealed carry permits, etc. It seems that Americans are free to bear arms - but only in their homes. That&rsquo;s fine if a burglar breaks into your home, but what if you are attacked or jumped in the street? I would hate to think, while lying in a hospital bed, that I could have defended myself with my gun, but I didn&rsquo;t have it. I don&rsquo;t know how much point there is in having a gun if you can&rsquo;t have access to it. Here in Canada and the U.K. the government have essentially disarmed the law-abiding populace. I have read a number of derogatory comments about this on AmRen, but now I wonder if perhaps this wasn&rsquo;t a bit unfair on some Americans part? I do absolutely agree that a person who has a gun on their person should try to avoid trouble or placing themselves in harms way. I also agree that the courts and cops are decidely biased against whites in this matter.    </p>
<p>To Browser at #24: &#8220;No sensible person is looking for trouble&#8221;.</p>
<p> Agreed sir. But what if trouble is looking for YOU?</p>

<p>Obviously a carry permit lets you carry concealed in public.  It&rsquo;s just that having a CCW permit doesn&rsquo;t give you the moral authority to go looking for trouble, or even hang out where trouble tends to brew.  Depending on the state, though, there are lots of places where even those with carry permits aren&rsquo;t allowed to carry, and in most states with CCW, most private businesses have the discretion to disallow carrying, and some do.</p>
<p>You ask, what if trouble comes looking for you?  I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s totally avoidable, so that&rsquo;s why I do have a carry permit and carry when and where I can.  It is my experience, though, that trouble will rarely find you if you don&rsquo;t go looking for it to begin with.</p>
