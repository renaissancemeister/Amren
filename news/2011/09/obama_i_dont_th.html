			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Terence P. Jeffrey, CNS News, September 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama told an audience of high school students in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday that he was &#8220;not always the very best student&#8221; and that ethics &#8220;would not have made it on the list&#8221; of his favorite subjects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not always the very best student that I could be when I was in high school, and certainly not when I was in middle school,&#8221; Obama said, speaking at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not love every class I took. I wasn&rsquo;t always paying attention the way I should have,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;I remember when I was in 8th grade I had to take a class called ethics. Now, ethics is about right and wrong, but if you&rsquo;d ask me what my favorite subject was back in 8th grade, it was basketball. I don&rsquo;t think ethics would have made it on the list.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama went on to tell the high school students that even though that 8th grade ethics class was not one of his favorites it did have a significant impact on his life  &mdash;  and now inspires the way he acts as president.</p>

		<p>I doubt if he could define the word, ethics&hellip;..</p>
<p>probably confuses it with, ethnics.<br>

<p><br>
And most likely not in college either, but how are we to know since his records are sealed? But don&rsquo;t worry Obama, you&rsquo;re not telling us anything we haven&rsquo;t already figured out.</p>

		<p>The most useful class I took in college was Logic 101, where the Greek syllogisms of 2 true statements and a conclusion were given, leaving it up to us to decide if the conclusion was true, false, or invalid.</p>
<p>Our president should take that class. </p>

		<p>It would be nice to see a video of the whole speech.  I&rsquo;d speculate his positive comments about ethics were an after-thought.  Of those who have interacted with him closely in offices, classrooms, etc., women especially get the sense he does not like them and does not easily sense what they sense.  <br>

		<p>This is not necessarily an accepted etymology, but I was made to understand that the word &#8220;ethics&#8221; comes from the Greek, &#8220;e-&#8221; (meaning away from) and &#8220;the&#8221; (meaning &#8220;God&#8221;).  Therefore &#8220;ethics&#8221; is the study of morality and values systems that evolved apart from organized religion or spirituality.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Obama, at least he went to ethics class.  By his own admission, by the second half of his high school years, his second favorite subject became dope smoking and crack snorting.  How someone who ditched so many classes was allowed to stay on the basketball team (bench warmer that he was) and graduate, is beyond me.  Unless it&rsquo;s not beyond me   &mdash;   The reason is obvious.  Must not be racist.</p>

		<p>Now that Obama is making it personal, I&rsquo;d like to raise a topic I&rsquo;ve long been puzzling over. Liberal politicians are not only working for equality of race and income class, but they also support diverse life-style choices. They champion gay rights, but they don&rsquo;t like to be seen campaigning in front of gays. Liberal politicians don&rsquo;t condemn alternative sexual lusts, but you won&rsquo;t find them in a handshake line-up at the entrance to the fetish ball. They prefer the name sex-trade worker to prostitute but what occupations do they wish for their own children? What responsibility do liberal politicians feel toward people who follow liberal sexual advice but end up with ruined lives?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m saying it&rsquo;s time for liberal politicians to be honest about this. </p>

<p>But the difference is that most of them would have the sense not to say so!</p>
<p><br>
I am amazed at such an ept blunder.  Apparently, when he doesn&rsquo;t have a carefully written script in front of him,  he doesn&rsquo;t know what to say.</p>

		<p>Most of the President&rsquo;s utterances and behaviors suggest he<br>
comes forth with reactions and words that are &#8220;weather vane&#8221; stuff.  He has been notorious for not meeting deadlines ( with<br>
publishers, e.g. ) and for certain other ruptures of shared expectations.   </p>

		<p>&#8220;and certainly not when I was in middle school,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Indonesian muslim madrassas do not have middle schools, everyone of all ages sit in rows on their rugs and bob their heads up and down as they read their Quran with the occassional switching on their backs if they appear not to be entranced enough. The muslim conduct when the muzzein goes off is like the Eloi reactions to the air raid siren going off in the movie &#8220;TIME MACHINE&#8221; with Rod Taylor. To my knowledge, there is no learning that goes on in those places.</p>

		<p>Re:  Comment #2 I think he (Obama/One Big Ass Mistake America) was already being groomed for this puppet post (POTUS) when his mother (Ann Dunham) worked for the Ford Foundation in Indonesia with Peter Geithner (Tim&rsquo;s father) back in the &rsquo;70s.  These people find each other like water seeks its own level.  Same with an obscure, unknown, useless Arkansas governor who was invited to participate in Bilderberg conferences in the &rsquo;80s.  Not only puppets but also traitors who sell their souls and their own people.  They&rsquo;d sell their own mothers in my view.</p>

		<p>An anecdote about the President during his years in a prestige<br>
silk stocking high school in Hawaii concerns basketball and ethics. He once started complaining that he&rsquo;d been taken out of the game because he was Black and implying racism on the part of the coach.Teammates said to him, &#8220;Barry, Barry, Barry  &mdash;  the coach took you out of the game because you were trying a lot of shots and not making many enough.&#8221;  In this manipulative gambit, &#8220;Black&#8221; seems to have been seen by Barry as &#8220;an all purpose tool&#8221;.  The ethics obviously serve the society of &#8220;me, myself,and I&#8221;.  His known biography seems replete with drop-the-ball violations of reasonable expectations existing between himself and others.  Not the least of these was his &#8220;failure&#8221; to get to his mother&rsquo;s bedside when she was dying of cancer.    </p>

Would ethics stand in relation to thought and intellect as<br>
sympathy stands in relation to emotions  &mdash;  -both dimensions  leading to shared assumptions and expectations?? </p>
