			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Kerby, BeliefNet, August 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An ex-Muslim convert to Christianity was attacked with boiling water and acid by fellow detainees in Norway, according to Mohabat, the Iranian Christian news agency.</p>
<p>He was attacked by fellow countrymen who are Muslims at an &#8220;asylum reception center&#8221; in Norway on Friday, according to Mohabat, which serves Farsi-speaking Christians in Iran as well as nearby countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ali&rsquo; (not his real name), an asylum seeker in an immigration center in Jaeren, Norway, had boiling water poured over him after he would not comply with Ramadan fasting rules. He and the other converts at the center now fear for their lives. &#8216;If you do not return to Islam, we will kill you,&rsquo; was the message from the other asylum seekers at the Asylum Reception in HÃ¥, in the Jaeren region of Norway,&#8221; Mohabat reported. </p>
<p>He refuses to disclose his real name for fear of further reprisals from them. If Afghan authorities found out about the incident and he were to be subsequently deported [back to Afghanistan] he risks being sentenced to death by stoning, he claims. Ali, his face distorted in pain, nevertheless maintains a calm voice as he told his story to Mohabat:</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Two of the Muslim residents asked why I had not fasted during Ramadan. When I would not answer, they began to discuss the matter. One of them said that he knew I was Muslim and converted to Christianity, and that they had to engage in Jihad.&#8221;
<p>One resident held Ali while another struck him in the back of the head with a pot of boiling water and Ali collapsed to the floor. Several other Muslim residents joined the commotion. A third man walked into Ali&rsquo;s room and began to trash it.</p>
<p>The police arrived, but only an hour later  &mdash;  the damage already done.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was still on the floor when police arrived. I told them a little, but was in too much pain to talk, so I was taken to hospital.</p>
<p>After a night in the hospital, Ali went back to the reception center, knowing that danger had not passed. When he checked, the door handle to his room turned out to be covered with an acidic substance that causes burns on contact.</p>
<p>He summoned the staff who washed away the chemical, but the Christian Afghan feel still does not feel safe.</blockquote></p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re really killing me,&#8221; he said in a message sent to Mohabat, &#8220;and they will not rest until they have done it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Leftist solution is of course to import more Muslims, launch a massive spending campaign on how peaceful Islam is, and raise a lot of public talk about how Muslims fear a backlash. Meanwhile, people who want to respond appropriately will be demonized with the vague moniker &#8220;far-right&#8221;, which is Newspeak code for &#8220;people who think wrong things&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Considering what a small country Norway is, population wise (4.5 million, 500,000 of which are Muslims, and 50,000 of which are Africans) this is awfully brazen of these Muslims to commit such a violent crime in public.</p>
<p>Crimes like these may not be reported in America, but it seems that Muslims in Europe have no fear of behaving like barbarians.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that in America, Muslims try to convince Americans they are reasonable, but in Europe they engage in all-out violent behavior with no internalized fear of repercussion.</p>

Voice of the Martyrs documents the persecution of Christians in Communist and Muslim nations.                                                                                                       Acid attacks against Christians is a common phenomenon in the Muslim world </p>
<p>When North African Muslims extend their crimes against Christians in the white world their is a legitimate reason to suspect that Muslims will carry out similar terror attacks against Christians in America.</p>
<p>America is a country based on Christian values and traditions.<br>
Since the seperation of church and state, and the introduction of Socialism, it is a matter of time until American&rsquo;s Of the Christian faith are dealt the same unforeseen punishment White Christians are being dealt in Europe by Muslim terrorists.</p>
<p>Although non-whites should not be allowed to immigrate to white nations and especially Scandinavia, the white world must recognize the persecution of Christians regardless of race.</p>

		<p>Christendom in general has evolved past witch-burning and torturing scientists.  Muslims still behead unbelievers just as they did in the 7th century. </p>
<p>Funny how we tolerate (rather, are forced to put up with) them and their alien beliefs.  Do they tolerate us?  Hardly.  Zero reciprocity.  Hypocrites and parasites.  </p>

		<p>Assaults on muslims leaving Islam (so called appostates) are brutal and cruel, often involving mutilation of women and in this case a man.</p>
<p>Surprisingly attacks on appostates of Islam are not regarded or treated as severly as &#8216;hate crimes&rsquo; yet they are by their nature cold blooded and pre-meditated.</p>
<p>Even the &#8216;hint&rsquo; of an assault being a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; does two things; it allows the prosecution to bring in prior convictions (impossible otherwise) and political orientation to try and prove their case.  Of course this then helps to bias the Jury.</p>
<p><br>
The frequency, severity and narture of this type of crime was never anticipated by Western law makers so special laws are required to protect those wishing to leave Islam.  The worst that would happen between Catholics, Protestants or say trendy western converts to Buddhism or Hinduism was a bit of shunning, if that.</p>
<p>The visciousness often handed out to appostates of Islam is one of the reasons that religion grows and consumes societies whether it be in the &#8216;liberal&rsquo; insecure west or in say Egypt. </p>
<p>It should not be tollerated, those immigrating to the west should know the most severe punishment awaits them.</p>
<p>Will the liberal/progressives defend &#8216;liberalism&rsquo;?  Their stance on female genital castration shows the pernicious simpering they are known for.</p>

		<p>Western nations do not believe you deserve to die if you change your religion (or become unsure of your beliefs/religion). Muslims do. These are fundamental differences that are irreconcilable. Muslims shouldn&rsquo;t be in Western nations that seem to condemn these very basic aspects of their religion. And the West shouldn&rsquo;t have people who believe in such nonsense to come over. </p>

		<p>I say the more publicity a story like this gets, the better.  People need to see what Islam truly produces - hatred, intolerance, brutality, and rank stupidity.  The more Americans that understand this the better - and the more hope we&rsquo;ll have of getting rid of this stain on our Republic.</p>

		<p>Converting to Christianity and then claiming asylum based on religious persecution is a dodge that has allowed many Russians and Ukrainians to immigrate into the U.S.  It is typically done through Protestant churches operating in those countries.  They are typically taught the conservative Christian line and pressured to vote Republican.  Looks like some Muslims have figured out the scheme.</p>

		<p>From the article: &#8220;&hellip;who are Muslims at an &ldquo;asylum reception center&rdquo; in Norway on Friday..&#8221;.: In no way do I believe there are any Muslims who seek asylum. They are invaders who have finally found a weakness within the West that they can and do exploit. The could not defeat us militarily, but they may very well destroy us from within. Eventually, Norway will become a battle ground where White Westerners battle the Islamists for control of that portion of the globe.  If we win, we can resettle the place with whatever Norwegian refugees make it out alive. If we lose, we will have only ourselves to blame.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Christendom in general has evolved past witch-burning and torturing scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, it has devolved, due the excesses of the French Revolution, the Marxist Bolshevist Revolution,  the Stalinist national murder of the Ukrainians, and the Multicultural &#8216;takeover of the institutions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stoning heretics, and burning at the stake, at least kept the civilian populace in line, back when most Europeans weren&rsquo;t literate to begin with.</p>
<p>Today, when the FedGov is seeking to dumb us down to the level of beasts, and/or consumerist drones, FEMA detention centers, freezing of bank assets, and UN troops in sovereign lands don&rsquo;t look much less dictatorial, than the occasional burning at the stake&hellip; for this time, it&rsquo;s going to be millions dead. I don&rsquo;t call that &#8216;progress.&rsquo; </p>

<p>&#8220;Although non-whites should not be allowed to immigrate to white nations and especially Scandinavia, the white world must recognize the persecution of Christians regardless of race.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are other and older cultural and spiritual traditions of white Europeans worldwide than Christianity alone.</p>
<p>This is a good illustration of how Christianity allows for race destroying Diversity to continue because it is focused on its survival as an organization rather than of the white race or any race.  It provides a huge back door for non-whites as long as they claim to be Christians.  </p>
<p>NAVY&rsquo;s entire post is a good example of the factual misrepresentations and distortions that Christians typically make as they tend to project themselves and their religious concerns, including those distortions on all whites. It always amazes me how little history actually know when posting opinions relying on purported historical data.  It isn&rsquo;t a matter of proving someone is wrong just to make them feel bad, it is the truth that falsifying history and mistaking its meaning only leads to dead ends. </p>
<p>The idea of separation of church and state began in 1789, when the Constitution was written.  That there have been religious factions battling it since then IS a historical fact.  Europe is full of social states that have not banned Christianity.  If the church was not actually complicit in those nations immigration policies in the blind hope or conceit of eventually making them Christians, the problems the various European states have would be far less.  Can we really think that the same numbers of converted Somalis, or Afghans, or whoever, would commit crimes or rape less?  Especially when they learn that they are forgiven?  Are we that naive?  Christianity survived in the USSR and Yugoslavia because only the churches were shut down, not the religious practices.  It was done because the church was so much involved in supporting the totalitarian rule of the imperial state.  </p>
<p>The 19th century is full of examples of various religious factions warring against one another. Eastern sects are fairly well known, but the America West is full of ghost towns or extant towns that were established or taken over by one sect of Christianity, Mormons, Quakers, Mennonites, or other Christian spinoffs.  Zane Grey&rsquo;s &#8220;Riders of the Purple Sage&#8221; is an account of the sort of tyrannical communities that these groups often were.  It is likely that a return to such tyranny would manifest if not for the laws that actually were the final outcome to Christian zealotry in America. After all, we have in our time seen believers who claim to defend fetuses, but feel that killing a doctor is a heavenly mandate from God.  (Spare me the arguments).</p>
<p>Opines such as those that NAVY made are dangerous to white survival because they ultimately overturn the badly needed momentum for uniting whites, and redirects it to aid Christian organizational strength in a false representation that some good old days that never were, can be replayed.  </p>

<p>Indeed.  <br>
Those (ahem) &#8220;asylum seekers&#8221; deserve no asylum or pity, since they give none to others. They have disqualified themselves from any claim to asylum.  They are just as bad as the people where they came from, the people from whom they are seeking asylum!</p>

		<p>Poster #14 seems to be anti-Slavic and one who thinks Slavs are non-whites with fair skin and blue eyes too. We are white, and we are Christians&hellip;..the only so-called Ukrainians and Russians who &#8220;convert to Christianity then claim assylum due to religious persecution&#8221; are Jews or Muslims. Christians were mercilessly oppressed, persecuted and killed to the tune of 80 million innocent people by the Jews and Muslims who actually controlled the U.S.S.R, not the other way around. I take offense to this, my grandparents and my father fled Ukraine because if the Nazis didn&rsquo;t murder them, the Jewish Bolshveiks would have. Just because someone speaks Ukrainian or Russian, looks European does not mean they are Ukrainian or Russian, there are many Jews who can pass for both. In those countries, you are either a Russian or a Ukrainian, or a Jew, not both.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Afghan authorities found out about the incident and he were to be subsequently deported [back to Afghanistan] he risks being sentenced to death by stoning, he claims.&#8221;</p>
<p>He converted to christianity, because then they can&rsquo;t deport since he risks persecution and death penalty back home.</p>
<p>Give him a good helping of bacon and tell him to eat it, and you&rsquo;ll likely find that he won&rsquo;t do that, since pork is &#8220;haram&#8221;, forbidden.</p>

		<p>In response to 17-Anon&rsquo;s critical assessment of 5-NAVY&rsquo;s comments. I believe 17-Anon has over invested into 5-NAVY&rsquo;s thoughts. NAVY clearly states that non-Whites should NOT be allowed to immigrate into White nations, yet 17-Anon pulls the analysis far into the realm where he is himself being anti-Christian. 17-Anon expresses points such as having Christian groups being pro non-White immigration, and hence, attempts to discredit the generally pro-White comments from NAVY.  I believe 17-Anon is also the same person who did something similar to my comments a few weeks ago, but since he comments as ANONYMOUS I can&rsquo;t be certain!  Again, on this thread, I support the comments by 5-NAVY, and wonder about 17-Anon: I suggest that if you wish to be pro-White, to please do so with constructive criticism and stop bashing those commenters who are truly pro-White in conscience.</p>
