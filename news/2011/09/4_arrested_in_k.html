<h1>4 Arrested in Kent Car-Show Shootout</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christine Clarridge, The Seattle Times, September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 250 people were at the July car show in Kent, bumping to the music of a rap group, when one of the performers invited the audience to throw out gang hand signs, police say.</p>
<p>The resulting display of gang affiliation sparked a shootout between rival Latino gang members, according to police, and left 12 people injured and more than a half-dozen men facing criminal charges.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Kent Police Chief Ken Thomas announced the arrest of four men in connection with the July 23 shooting in the parking lot of the La Plaza strip mall. Police say two other men have been charged with assault and are being sought on warrants.</p>
<p>In addition, there are at least two more suspects from the shooting at the La Raza Car Show and Concert that police are working to identify.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe there were five shooters and that there are at least two other additional shooters out there,&#8221; Thomas said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thomas said detectives and crime analysts from 14 law-enforcement agencies, as well as gang experts and prosecutors, logged more than 2,000 hours investigating the shooting, which propelled King County to dedicate $1.4 million to combat what officials have called an erupting war among Latino gangs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The shooting erupted during the unauthorized lowrider car show that drew 200 to 300 people to the shopping center. The victims ranged in age from 14 to 32, according to police.</p>

		<p>Quick facts on Mestizo super- violence:<br>
A car show heralding the ultra- racist &#8220;La Raza&#8221; moniker has about 300 attendees.<br>
12 are injured in a shootout /  brawl.</p>
<p>This very weekend, just a half-block from my house, no less than 20,000 people- probably 95% white will gather for an arts and crafts festival, a yearly event in my neighborhood. They&rsquo;re parked up and down every street, jam packed right now, and I cannot even HEAR them. The festival grounds are about 150 yards from here, and short of seeing all the cars lining my street, I&rsquo;d think I was the last man on earth. So quiet. No boom cars, no shouting. Just the inconvenience of parking hell&hellip;but HEY! they&rsquo;re white, so it&rsquo;s as peaceful as an open field with nothing  more dangerous than a blowing breeze! (Suddenly I&rsquo;m THANKFUL for these throngs of peaceful people crowding my neighborhood). <br>
As with EVERY YEAR, ZERO shootings. Gotta&rsquo; laugh at that. Hell, ZERO INCIDENTS. (Don&rsquo;t you LOVE the fact that at an all- white gathering, you can bump into someone else, and nobody even needs to apologize? You just pat each other as you pass. For Mestizos, that&rsquo;s cause for bloodshed!<br>
Some more numerate out there want to tell me the comparative differences?<br>
Geez, 300 Mestizos, a dozen wounded. 20k whites, maybe even 30 thousand, nary a fistfight.<br>
Gotta&rsquo; love that diversity! SO enriching!<br>
I want to shout it from the rooftops. Whites are civilized. Mestizos are death itself.</p>

		<p>Seems to me that the performer who encouraged the audience to show gang hand signs could be charged with inciting a riot. This appears to be provoking violence, as it is the gangster code to always fight rivals. Just another fine example of the great customs and culture being brought to the USA from south of the border.</p>

		<p>I agree with what SF Paul said. If this rapper incited those in the audience to commit violence he certainly SHOULD be charged for attempting to incite a riot  &mdash;  especially IF he knew there were gang members present.</p>

   A detailed narrative of the investigation is attached to court papers linked by the Seattle Times. It&rsquo;s quite interesting reading. Done by a Kent police detective, the report reveals that rival members of three gangs were apparently involved: the Playboy Surenos (PBS), Varrios Locos (VL) and Little Valley Lokates (LVL). </p>
<p>At some point, a member of a band playing at the event encouraged people in the crowd to &ldquo;hold their flags in the air,&rdquo; which the crowd apparently presumed to mean showing their gang signs. From there, things went downhill fast.</p>
<p><br>
   It is an unusual mix of suspects, considering that two of the men jailed have no criminal backgrounds, and two others – both brothers – weren&rsquo;t even at the event, but they&rsquo;re in trouble, anyway. </p>
<p>Patrick A. Auble, 30, of Tacoma. He is charged with first-degree rendering criminal assistance for hiding a gun used in the shooting. He reportedly has a criminal history that includes obstructing justice, reckless driving and ten counts of driving with a suspended license. Currently held on $100,000 bail, he allegedly tried to negotiate with police for the release of his brother from jail and return of four guns belonging to him in exchange for the gun used in the shooting, according to the detective&rsquo;s narrative. </p>
<p>Shea C. Auble, 21, of Auburn. He&rsquo;s the brother whose arrest was the subject of Patrick&rsquo;s attempted negotiation with the cops. Shea is charged with first-degree rendering criminal assistance. He also has a &ldquo;lengthy criminal history&rdquo; that includes charges of residential burglary, assault, taking a motor vehicle without permission (that&rsquo;s auto theft in plain language) and malicious mischief. His bail is also set at $100,000.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>James Lopez Jr., 17, of Seattle. He also had no criminal history until now, and he&rsquo;s charged as an accomplice for allegedly being the driver of one of the getaway cars. He is charged as an adult and is being held on $250,000 bail.</p>
<p>   Currently being sought in this caper are Ignacio Vasquez-Trevino, 19, of Federal Way and Nicholas Moreno, 21, of Auburn. Vasquez-Trevino is allegedly one of the shooters, wanted on three charges of first-degree assault. Moreno is allegedly another shooter, also charged with three counts of first-degree assault.</p>
<p>   According to the detective&rsquo;s narrative, Patrick Auble called police on the night of the shooting, looking to make a deal. An hour earlier, Shea had been arrested on an outstanding warrant, after police were called to a residence where two people were firing guns in the street. Shea was one of the two people arrested, and police also confiscated two 9mm pistols, a .40-caliber pistol and a .223-caliber rifle. </p>
<p>   Patrick said he had information about the shooting, a vehicle involved, and a gun. In exchange, he wanted his little brother sprung and his guns returned. He called back later, telling police that &ldquo;if he didn&rsquo;t hear back from the police or his brother by 0100 hours, &lsquo;Things will disappear&rsquo;.&rdquo; Two days later, on July 25, he called again, with the same demand, the report states.</p>
<p>   On July 26, two detectives talked to Shea Auble in jail. Shea turned out to be a negotiator, too, according to the detective&rsquo;s narrative. He allegedly told the detectives that he had information about the shooting, in exchange for getting five pending felony charges dropped. </p>
<p>   The narrative reads like the script to a Quentin Tarantino movie. Not only was Patrick Auble allegedly hiding one of the guns involved, he was also hiding a car belonging to suspect Moreno in the garage of his parents&rsquo; home.<br>

<p>&#8220;Quick facts on Mestizo super- violence:&#8221;</p>
<p>One important fact you are missing; the vast majority of Hispanics have little or zero Spanish blood and are in fact &#8220;Indiants&#8221; tribal peoples who only have Spanish names because the Catholic priests that converted them assigned &#8220;Christian&#8221; names.  The genetic taste for extremes of volatility and gory violence comes from there.</p>

<p>It would be the same way if you had 20,000 blacks. Everything would be peaceful and quiet. Whites aren&rsquo;t the only ones to be civilized.</p>

		<p>.one of those mexican illegal gang members who have taken over Kent wa was busted for drug dealing this week. You can see his mug shot and he is big and fat and ugly if you go to the site.<br>
 I grew up in the Seattle area and until the invasion from Mexico came, we had no mexican gangs- only a few Hawaiian or filipino and not much there either.<br>

<p>2011-09/1002/47806/Tovar.jpgA Kent, Washington man was arrested early Tuesday morning during a traffic stop when Oregon State Police (OSP) troopers discovered approximately 24 pounds of marijuana concealed in the man&rsquo;s rented vehicle on Interstate 5 near Roseburg. The OSP Drug Enforcement Section is continuing the investigation. </p>
