<h1>Administration Offers Advice to Concerned Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Bauer-Wolf, The Towerlight, September 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a Sept. 9 meeting discussing the then non-affiliated student organization Youth for Western Civilization, the common phrase passed around among the leaders of the Center for Diversity was &#8220;our hands are tied.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSD directors Santiago Solis, Joan Maze, Marie Lilly, Director of Student Activities Dirron Allen, and Interim Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs for Diversity and Director of the Counseling Center Jim Spivack convened with student leaders of diversity organizations to hear their concerns.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some students, like junior Zach Kosinski, expressed that he would not feel safe on campus if SGA affiliated YWC.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t leave my apartment. I would be so scared,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kosinksi said events YWC will potentially hold, including Straight Pride and Confederate Heritage Weeks, would further the fear and paranoia of those who might identify with the LGBTQIA community, but are not &#8220;out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Student Union President Kenan Herbert mentioned that the YWC&rsquo;s potential affiliation would affect academic performance as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;It puts emotional stress on us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Which in turn affects our academic performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilly, the associate director of Women&rsquo;s Resources, said that staff couldn&rsquo;t take a stance, despite these concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we can help,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was a professional activist for years. And if you come to me, I can advise you as to what works and to what doesn&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But when a member of the Queer Student Union addressed SGA Attorney General Brandy Hall was asked whether a known hate group Ku Klux Klan would be allowed on campus if they included a non-discriminatory clause, Allen reacted.</p>
<p>&#8220;[The KKK] would not be allowed on campus,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And this group is basically the same thing.&#8221;</p>

		<p>lol  the center for diversity doesn&rsquo;t sound very diverse. Wonder how many groups for white students are welcome at this center for diversity? youth for western civilization isn&rsquo;t even pro-whites. Shouldn&rsquo;t activist groups for white students be there to join their colored brothers and sisters at the center? How can they be diverse with no white interest groups as members?</p>

<p>As a barometer of society&rsquo;s condition, this is deplorable behavior.</p>

		<p>I had to google LGBTQIA. I knew the first four letters, but did not know the last three. </p>
<p>Apparently, &#8220;diversity organizations&#8221; means everyone except white people. What an absurdity that &#8220;diverse&#8221; people have so much fear (or is it jealousy?) for the civilization that created the universities in which they are enrolled! </p>

		<p>This article presents the term LGBTQIA. I had to look it up, here you go: Lesbian-Gay-Bisexual-Transgender-Questioning-Intersex-Ally. These tolerance groups seem to be fond of militant terms like &lsquo;ally&rsquo;, or &lsquo;we have our hands tied&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Kind of makes you wonder what these tolerance people would like to do, in their heart of hearts, with their hands if they were not tied. In any case, the LGBTQIA representative highlighted in the article appears to have a Twitter feed in the case that you are (1) not on a work computer and (2) wish to get a glimpse into his thought processes.</p>

<p>I think you are a liar Mr. Herbert and a phoney to boot. Did it ever occur to you that when your black union meets up it might stress others out considering the number of black flashmobs over the summer? Of course not. It&rsquo;s all about YOU isn&rsquo;t it? Which group of people usually turn violent when large numbers of them come together?</p>
<p>But when a member of the Queer Student Union addressed SGA Attorney General Brandy Hall was asked whether a known hate group Ku Klux Klan would be allowed on campus if they included a non-discriminatory clause, Allen reacted.</p>
<p><br>
Aww&hellip; come on queer student, surely you can do better than that. It&rsquo;s such an outdated insult. I wonder when gay rights activists come to speak with your group if sex orgies are allowed along with limp wrist practice, latest fashion talk for the guys, and a strong woman contest for the girls? What&rsquo;s that? Those things are a total misrepresentation of your group? Well! Imagine that!</p>

<p>What a weak, pathetic young man this is! But yet, he feels completely safe that a &#8220;black student union&#8221; is on campus. He&rsquo;s a perfect example of why the YWC is needed on all college campuses. Zach my boy, I know you mean well but unless you change your attitude you&rsquo;re going to have a rough life ahead of you.</p>
<p>*Black Student Union President Kenan Herbert mentioned that the YWC&rsquo;s potential affiliation would affect academic performance as well.&ldquo;It puts emotional stress on us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Which in turn affects our academic performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So whats your excuse for the dismal academic performance of blacks on campuses that DON&rsquo;T have the YWC there, or blacks in Africa? Why didn&rsquo;t someone ask him how he thinks that his group isn&rsquo;t &#8220;racisss&#8221; sinse they only exist to promote BLACK causes, and how that&rsquo;s different from the YWC. Also, how does a group promoting WESTERN culture put &#8220;stress&#8221; on him, isn&rsquo;t he immerst in Western culture living in this country, and doesn&rsquo;t he take full advantage and benefit from that? What about the Whites that are emotionally stressed by the presents of The Black Student Union?</p>
<p>*Lilly, the associate director of Women&rsquo;s Resources, said that staff couldn&rsquo;t take a stance, despite these concerns.</p>
<p>*&ldquo;But we can help,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was a professional activist for years. And if you come to me, I can advise you as to what works and to what doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My, my, not just an activist but a PROFESSIONAL activist at that! Just how does one become a professional activist?</p>
<p>I would suggest that once the YWC gets on campus they should take her up on her offer. They should ask her advice on how to rid the campus of racist, sexist organizations such as The Black Student Union and the Woman&rsquo;s Resources. Hopefully they will record her responce and share it with us, the look on her face alone would be price-less don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>Like I posted awhile back, the YWC is a group we should donate to and take under our wing. These are young Whites that &#8220;get it&#8221; AND are willing to speak out, and thats very rare. The other side has ADULTS fighting for them so the YWC needs adults fighting for them be it donations, e-mails to the colleges, notes of encouragement etc.. We can&rsquo;t allow them to fight this battle alone.   </p>

<p>Their &#8220;hands are tied&#8221; because Towson University is a public school in Maryland, and because it receives financial support from the state, and surely in some direct or indirect fashion from the Feds, their &#8220;hands are tied&#8221; by the 1st Amendment to the Federal Constitution and 10th Article of the Maryland Constitution&rsquo;s Declaration of Rights.</p>

<p>Nonsense.  But he&rsquo;ll say this to get the university to squelch a conservative student group. YWC has never carried out or condoned acts of violence.  But leftists have carried out many acts of violence against them.</p>

		<p>I say universities are the main battleground against the  Diversity forces. Almost the entire university establishment is on the Diversity side. There is so much authority there. It is so powerful. Talk about a fortress! But there is some strength on our side. We can take the battle to the Diversity side. We needn&rsquo;t always be in retreat. I&rsquo;d say a plum target would be sociology departments in the deep southern states of Dixie. A determined governor could change what is taught in a university department. Create a few chairs in a department and amply fund them and you have a power base. Change the manual of practice for the government civil service and that will force the profs to adjust. All you need is a feisty governor and an electorate angry at the establishment. That shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find.  </p>

		<p>Do those Liberal Whites fear La Raza and Black Panther type groups on their Campuses? No, that would be racist. Even though these same groups engage in horrific crimes against them. </p>
<p>But a group of White College Students that want Western Civilization extolled is akin to the Ku Klux Klan? Interesting. </p>
<p>So, there it is, plain and simple. If you value your own White Race, and its accomplishments through the millenia, then that makes you a Klansman or a Nazi, because the Liberals and Communists say so. Was George Washington a Klansman or Nazi? </p>
<p>Amreners, take out your checkbooks, and offer even a small donation to these level headed White Youth of ours. They need all the finacial and moral support they can get. </p>

		<p>Tom S.#6: You, and other Amreners, should visit the website for Tradition, Family and Property.org. They are a Religious group that fights for Traditional Marriage, an end to Abortion, and for Moral Values on Campus. </p>
<p>I have had friends send emails to me, that they received from this group, showing a group of well dressed College aged men in suits, holding up signs on street corners, and saying prayers for the soul of this Nation, all while being spit on, ridiculed, harrassed, having their signs ripped apart, and one young man was hit in the head with a soda bottle. </p>
<p>This is the true face of the &#8220;Tolerant&#8221; Liberal Left. As a matter of fact, the name of one of their TFP videos is called, &#8220;The Faces of Tolerance&#8221;. </p>
<p>Liberals and Communists are very tolerant, as long as you are saying what they want to hear. If you have a different opinion than they do, well, they will attack you verbally, and physically. </p>
<p>For the Blacks that feel &#8220;emotionally stressed&#8221; by the presence of Youth for Western Civilization, what is their excuse for extremely poor preformaces in all Inner-City Schools where Whites are 1% of the Student Body?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crutch, Kenan, and you, and we, all know it. You just need another excuse for failing miserably in your studies, if you ever really study in the first place. This is just the flavor of the week.</p>

Well, I am a NON-religious person who upholds Traditional Marriage, an end to Abortion, neat clothing, and Moral Values on Campus. <br>
So what do you have to say about THAT?</p>
<p>Saying prayers on street corners will get you nowhere; only intelligent action will do it. Being a bible thumper is a waste of time and turns many people off. </p>
<p>Forget the mumbo-jumbo! That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re going downhill the way we are.  What success do people like you have to show for your feckless approach?  Exactly NONE!</p>

		<p>YWC doesn&rsquo;t preach or practice violence.  Nor is membership exclusionary.  Why would a minority student be &#8220;scared to come out of my apartment&#8221;?  Does the First Amendment scare you?  Freedom to express ideas?  Your ideas and behaviors are ok, but another&rsquo;s non-violent expressions are not?  Hypocrite.</p>

		<p>I live near Towson University  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s nestled in an almost-90 percent White suburb of Baltimore. For example, the local high school is always on Newsweek&rsquo;s Best High Schools list (Michael Phelps attended there). These college kids wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do if Towson turned into Temple in North Philly, as if by magic. Towson University is also known as one of the East Coast&rsquo;s top party schools, as ranked by Playboy. From what I can see at the liquor store and Starbucks, they&rsquo;re not all that into politics  &mdash;  just sex, drinking and the other stuff, and, of course, rock &#8216;n&rsquo;roll. And they get less bright with every passing year.</p>

		<p>Browser #15: That&rsquo;s exactly why this Nation is in the condition it is in. </p>
<p>I understand that you believe that prayer cannot heal a Nation. Well, we are in the position we are in morally, culturally, racially, and demographically because we turned our back on our traditional Christian heritage, a heritage embraced by the Founding Fathers, as well as the discoverer of the Americas, Christopher Columbus, and his Spanish Explorers. </p>
<p>Many of the Founding Fathers expressed in writing that if America does not stay true to its Christian heritage, it will no longer be a land of Free and Independent people. </p>
<p>We can see examples of this daily, as our Constitution is ignored or abused, as Same Sex Marriages are condoned and codified into law, as these same &#8220;Couples&#8221; adopt impressionable children, as races are permitted to mix and &#8220;Marry&#8221;, further codifying what is not natural.</p>
<p>All this takes place while the majority of White people who identify themselves as Christians remain silent, or grumble in low tones at home. That gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>It states clearly in the Bible that GOD destroys HIS people with their enemies, when they turn their backs on HIM. Coutless times this has occured in the Old Testament, but we still ignore GOD. </p>
<p>I have heard nothing but various renditions of &#8220;GOD Bless America&#8221;, &#8220;America, The Beautiful&#8221;, and &#8220;Amazing Grace&#8221; which are all Christian based music, yet, we purged the very GOD these hypocries sing to on the Fourth of July, and September 11th, Veterans&rsquo; Day, and Memorial Day, to re-establish the Patriotism in people who are otherwise ignored, scoffed at, and marginalized. </p>
<p>These songs are useful for those running the country, at least for now, to help people follow the ruling crowd. But &#8220;GOD Bless America&#8221; was written by Irving Berlin, during World War II, when this Country had to fight for its life, and the majority of the Citizens were White Christians.  </p>
<p>This song, and the others, just don&rsquo;t fit into the American culture of today. Why should GOD bless this Country? </p>
<p>I do not care if you have a Faith that guides you or not, but taking shots at those White Christians in this Country, who call on GOD through prayer, is normally what I would expect from the Atheist, Communist Left. </p>
<p>It takes moral and physical courage to do nothing to your adversaries except pray, for them and us, in public, and to endure the harassment, verbal, and physical abuse these clean cut, moral men have endured. </p>
<p>The Left loves to agitate, and instigate fights and brawls in Public, knowing that their Allies, the Media, will spin the events if these same young men went out and returned the verbal insults, and punches thrown. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t persoanlly engage in this type of activity. These College aged men are better than I could ever be. </p>
<p>You write about &#8220;intelligent action&#8221;. What &#8220;intelligent action&#8221; are you referring to, and what actions, if any, have you taken? Please elaborate. </p>
<p>You referred to &#8220;Bible thumping&#8221; in your post. Well, I am going to paraphrase Country Singer, Charlie Daniels, when I saw him in Concert, when he said, &#8220;I read my Bible daily, but I have never thumped it&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s something to chew on. Thugs in the minority community and the MSM consider blond haired white men, and white men in general, effiminate. This is bolstered by racism within minority communties and MSM programming. </p>
<p>Let me give you a very specific example. The Wikipedia listing for &#8220;blond&#8221; displays a very effeminate looking blond haired man as the poster boy for what blond men look like&hellip;.their hatred and racist propaganda is quite obvious here.  My solution: go to the wikipedia link:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blond_hair" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blond_hair</a></p>
<p>Go to the edit page and delete the photo. Either leave it blank or replace it with a photo of a blond MMA fighter or Chuck Norris, etc. The communist wikipedia staff will change it back and block you, but if thousands of us do it, they will get the message. It might also save some blond children the daily harrassment and assaults that they endure every day by school bullies.  Just a thought&hellip;and it&rsquo;s an easy way to hit back. </p>

		<p>Number #20: I went to a German Festival Saturday, and saw countless blond men and women of tall stature. By that I mean that many of these men were between 6&rsquo;4&#8221; and 6&rsquo;8&#8221; inches tall, and the women 5&rsquo;10 to 6&rsquo;. One guy told me he wore a size 18 shoe. </p>
<p>Now, I am fairly tall at 6&rsquo;3&#8221; with a size 14 shoe, but felt I was in a land of giants at this Festival.</p>
<p>None of these men looked like the type that a black or Hispanic would want to screw around with, because any one of them could break them in half. </p>
<p>As far as posting pictures of blond haired men that are rugged  there are quite a few that come to mind, such as Hulk Hogan, Dan Haggerty, formerly Grizzly Adams, Clint Eastwood, who was refered to as &#8220;Blondie&#8221; by Tuco, in the &#8220;Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&#8221;. </p>
<p>If you really want to see their heads spin then post pictures of Norse Vikings with full Battle gear, or the Waffen SS, which was the most feared fighting force during World War II. </p>

There is almost no difference between the universities of the South and anywhere else.  Years of diversity training, socialists in charge and the forced integration of huge numbers of academicly poor yet entitlement rich minorities have transformed Southern colleges and universities. A case in point, my university, Florida State University, located in Tallahassee, Florida, negotiated an agreement with The Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation in 2008 to give the economics department $1.5 million. In return The Foundation would have some say over which professorial candidates should be interviewed. Well you would have thought a deal was made with a secretive neo-nazi organization bent on altering the minds of young people with dreams of the Fourth Reich.  No influence of conservative thought will be allowed and the fight was amazing to destroy this agreement.  No, Southern schools are not immune to the brain washing that has sadly destroyed academic freedom and sanity elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Koch foundations and organizations are mostly libertarian, not conservative (quote-unquote), and definitely not racial nationalist.  Even among libertarians, Koch influence is controversial.  Also, Koch money funds a lot of PBS shows.</p>
<p>I think all this leftist noise about &#8220;Koch&#8221; is all a result of them having to work up some conspiracy theory to explain why they&rsquo;re on the losing side of elections and issues all of a sudden.  It&rsquo;s also projection, because they know most of their success is Soros-driven.</p>

		<p>#22 - I agree that professors are mostly of the same beliefs from coast to coast. I was thinking more of the political will needed to force changes. I would emphasize the sabotage of conservative values by liberal academics. It should be intolerable to conservatives that universities are teaching that conservative values are unscientific and unethical. From my perspective in liberal Canada, it seems Dixie has the most political strength and voter support to take the fight to the universities. </p>
