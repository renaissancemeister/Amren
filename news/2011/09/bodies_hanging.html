<h1>Bodies Hanging from Bridge in Mexico Are Warning to Social Media Users</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mariano Castillo, CNN, September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Social media users who denounce drug cartel activities along the Mexican border received a brutal warning this week: Two mangled bodies hanging like cuts of meat from a pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p>A woman was hogtied and disemboweled, her intestines protruding from three deep cuts on her abdomen. Attackers left her topless, dangling by her feet and hands from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. A bloodied man next to her was hanging by his hands, his right shoulder severed so deeply the bone was visible.</p>
<p>Signs left near the bodies declared the pair, both apparently in their early 20s, were killed for posting denouncements of drug cartel activities on a social network.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to happen to all of those posting funny things on the Internet,&#8221; one sign said. &#8220;You better (expletive) pay attention. I&rsquo;m about to get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gruesome scene sent a chilling message at a time when online posts have become some of the loudest voices reporting violence in Mexico. In some parts of the country, threats from cartels have silenced traditional media. Sometimes even local authorities fear speaking out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They were signed &#8220;Z,&#8221; a possible reference for the Zetas cartel, which operates in the area.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>This extreme violence seems to be a cultural thing specific to Mexico. Here in Baltimore, the Democrat Governor O&rsquo;Malley calls illegals &#8220;new Americans,&#8221; and is doing everything possible to import them to Maryland including giving them free college tuition. Some people have no soul.</p>

		<p>Most likely these were two random victims who were not engaging in social networking.  It shows the cartels are worried about that kind of activity - it&rsquo;s an act of worry, not power.</p>

		<p>This is excellent. </p>
<p>You see if you let things develop on their own they will cut their own throats. </p>
<p>Would Obama or Holder defend legalization with this going on in the media who cant avoid it no mater how hard they try? </p>

<p>Most likely you are correct; the two victims may have run afoul some other way. Regardless the cartel has plenty of money to bribe Mexican tech support workers at ISP providers so who would want to take the chance?<br>

<p>Yes, they&rsquo;ll defend legalization,  more now than ever.  It gives them MORE of an excuse to amnesty illegals   &mdash;   can&rsquo;t send them back to Mexico, after all, far too dangerous.</p>
<p>Acts like the one above put MORE pressure on the US borders as desperate refugees flee Mexico&rsquo;s Civil War and demand entry into the US.</p>
<p>I fully expect more unskilled, illiterate mexicans to insist the US let them in, with Holder and Obama welcoming new Democratic voters by granting them refugee status.</p>

		<p>The only important thing about incident like this is they are paid for with US tax welfare dollars.</p>
<p>Almost no welfare money goes to those who need it.  All of it goes to drugs.  Drug money provides ALL the power to psychopaths in both the US and mexico.</p>
<p>This situation could be ended overnight by the adoption of whites only welfare followed by a policy of shooting anyone who has a problem with this on sight.</p>
<p>NOTHING practically, would change in the lifestyle of non-whites except they would no longer buy mexican drugs.  Which I am sure is considered the end of the world by most non-whites.</p>
<p>The quality of life of every normal person in both countries would rise dramatically.</p>
<p>What I am getting to here is normal, common sense discrimination of the type that was taken for granted for 50 years before this became a problem.  Those who NEED welfare are obvious. Give it to them.  Those who are just druggies, are obvious as well.  Don&rsquo;t give them anything.  A simple drug test can often separate the two groups.</p>
<p>Basically, if you are under age 60 and your leg wasn&rsquo;t sheered off somehow&hellip;no soup for you.</p>

		<p>Common sense would dictate that no one should report anything they see about the Cartels, or the Police, to anyone else. Just keep your mouths shut. </p>
<p>I saw a Classic movie on Cable called &#8220;Viva Zapata&#8221; with Marlon Brando. The violence and murder, even of their own people, is a constant in this uncivilized land. </p>
<p>What happened in the movie is still going on, today. The only thing that changes are the weapons used. </p>

		<p>The Mexican press is not really a &#8220;free&#8221; press by any stretch of the imasgination. Throughout the years, politicians and others with plenty of clout, money, influence, power, etc. have done what they can to suppress it. It has been said that being ANY kind of journalist in Mexico has become a truly dangerous profession in recent years and that even the reporters, news anchors and others employed by the Televisa nertwork (Mexico&rsquo;s biggest and most powerful TV network) are not immune to being harassed or threatened by organized crime syndicates. When DEA agent Enrique Camarena was kidnapped (In broad daylight!), tortured and murdered in early 1985, it is said that the kidnapping did NOT make the Mexican newspapers or TV stations for several days until after it was all over the news here in the USA and that the Mexican government gave the American television networks&rsquo; reporters, directors and others who were sent to Mexico to cover the story a very hard time. Of course, when you consider the power and influence wielded by drug traffickers and organized crime syndicate bosses it becomes easier to see why this is so.</p>
