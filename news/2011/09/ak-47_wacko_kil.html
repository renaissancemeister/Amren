<h1><a href="https://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/ak_wacko_kills_soldiers_SsIBm3DeGRn5rOu43Ja4oN">AK-47 Wacko Kills Soldiers</a></h1>
 

<p>Leonard Greene, New York Post, September 7, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>A lunatic with an AK-47 opened fire on five uniformed National Guard members eating at a Nevada IHOP yesterday-killing three of them and injuring the other two, before blowing himself away, authorities said.</p>
<p>Crazed killer Eduardo Sencion, 32, of Carson City, targeted the soldiers, but his wild gunfire also killed one civilian customer and injured five others.</p>
<p>One of the dead soldiers was a woman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sencion worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe. He was not in the military, and had no known connection to anyone inside the restaurant.</p>
<p>Authorities said the shooter was born in Mexico and had a valid US passport.</p>
<p>The carnage unfolded at around 9 a.m., when the lone gunman pulled up in the parking lot in a blue minivan-with a yellow &#8220;Support Our Troops&#8221; sticker-and shot a man on a motorcycle before opening fire from the back of the restaurant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Witnesses said Sencion jumped back into the van and drove around in circles while firing shots at other stores in the strip mall and at a casino across the street.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>FBI Special Agent Michael West said there&rsquo;s no indication terrorists were behind the bloodbath.</p>
<p>Sencion&rsquo;s family raised concerns about his mental health, Carson City Sheriff Kenny Furlong said. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>His former lawyer, Joe Laub, said he was surprised to learn Sencion was behind the carnage.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s a gentle, kind man who was very helpful to friends and family,&#8221; Laub said.</p>
