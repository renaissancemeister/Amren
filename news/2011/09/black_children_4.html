			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kathleen Lucadamo, NY Daily News, September 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black children in New York die from injuries at double the rate of other city kids  &mdash;  although youngsters here are safer than in many other cities.</p>
<p>Those are the findings of a Health Department study of child mortality that looked at the fatal injuries of 470 kids up to age 12 between 2001 and 2009.</p>
<p>The report says slightly more than six of every 100,000 black children die of injuries in the city, while the rate for white, Hispanic and Asian kids is closer to three.</p>
<p>Health Commissioner Thomas Farley says the disparity may be rooted in circumstance: black children are more likely to live in low-income neighborhoods with housing hazards such as missing window guards.</p>
<p>Black and Hispanic children also have high rates of homicide or suicide, which are included with injury deaths.</p>
<p>Overall, fewer city kids are dying from injuries compared with the national average  &mdash;  mostly because there are fewer drivers and fewer car accidents.</p>

		<p>&#8220;missing window guards &hellip; high rates of homicide or suicide,&#8221;</p>
<p>OH YES, it is this, it is that, etc.</p>
<p>MOSTLY because they do dumb stupid things that are dangerous and they know are dangerous when they do them and then die in the process. Climbing up the girders of the EL tracks and throwing iron bars at the 3rd electrified rail to see the sparks fly. Then when get fried wonder why.</p>

		<p>As a young white male, I can attest, I had quite a few &#8216;close calls&rsquo; for being extreemly stupid, adverturous, and high risk, where it ONLY concerned myself. No other people were ever threatened. Yea, too many close calls. Natural selection knocked on my door a few times.</p>

<p>Suicide? Yeah, right. I think it&rsquo;s mostly homicide.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&hellip;so once again, ignoring the anticipated &#8220;spin&#8221; on such an article, it seems painfully obvious that it is, in point of fact, the behavior of Blacks that is the real problem with Blacks. </p>

		<p>I noticed a long time ago that black child was the most dangerous job in the world, they seem to end up in dryers, microwaves, dumpsters or toilets, pushed out of windows and moving cars, beaten, burned, scalded, used as clubs or shields, and they get raped, whether they are 8 months, 8 weeks or 8 days, old, they suffer lots of rapes at the hands of fathers, uncles and boyfriends. Infants show up at hospitals with fractured skulls and ribs, both recent and healed. The amount of abuse endured by black children at the hands of parents and relatives is the dirty little secret of the black &#8220;community&#8221;, and only about 1% is ever reported.</p>

		<p>In a 2 week visit to relatives in N. Illinois I read about the deaths of 4 black children.</p>
<p>First Mother moved into a high rise housing project.  She brought the 2 kids up with the first load of furniture.  She had a baby boy and a 5 year old girl.  She set them up in a bedroom with a playpen, TV, toys and cookies. Seemed like a reasonable plan.</p>
<p>She and the movers went up and down a couple more times.  She either did not lock the door or the rapist had some sort of pass key.  On her 3rd trip upstairs she found the door open and the girl missing.  Girl was found smashed to death in the parking lot.  Black man had raped the girl and throw her off 8th floor balcony.</p>
<p>Second  Black woman went downstairs to do laundry and stopped off to visit with a friend.  Family lived in one of those older apartments with steam heat radiators.  Her 2 oldest children, 5 and 7 managed to unscrew the main pipe of a radiator.  It was late afternoon when the heat comes on.  The burst of steam scalded the baby to death.  Mom obviously spent a long time visiting but how in the world those kids managed to unscrew the main pipe is beyond me.</p>
<p>Third  My visit was in late March.  Snow had melted.  Gary Indianna public swimming pools are surrounded with 18 feet high fences topped by razor wire.  Black kids cut through the fences with wire cutters.  Tadpoles hatch in the water accumulated in swimming pools when the snow melts.  Black kids invade the pools to catch tadpoles.  They enjoy burning tadpoles or immersing the in gasoline or rubbing alcohol.</p>
<p>A black brother and sister got into the deep end, could not get out and drowned.</p>
<p>Black kids are inherently disobedient.  They do not learn when something bad happens as a consequence of disobeying.  Tell them not to touch a hot pan and they will touch it just out of their disobedient and contrary nature.  They love anything destructive.<br>
Otherwise why in the world would 2 small children decide to dismantle a radiator?</p>
<p>I remember an incident in  my surban bus terminal.  It serves 3 bus lines, one orange, one blue and one green.  A group of black kids in one of those summer day camp programs saw their green bus pulling into the terminal.</p>
<p>Their black camp counselors had them waiting for the light to change.  As soon as they saw their green bus the entire group of about 20 dashed across an 8 lane street at 4/30pm rush hour traffic. The counselors took off after them yelling at them to get back.</p>
<p>It was an insane stampede.  No one got hurt, mostly because traffic is bumper to bumper 5 miles an hour at rush hour.</p>
<p>The kids stampeded onto the bus and then hooted and hollered because the bus was not scheduled to depart for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Granted most are killed by black friends and relatives.  But so many black children kill themselves because of their behavior.</p>

<p>-In the U.S., non-Hispanic Caucasians are nearly 2.5 times more likely to kill themselves than African Americans or Hispanics.</p>
<p>- Unsupervised kids have higher accident rates.<br>

		<p>Leading causes of death in the United States - kids</p>
<p>The top two causes, Unintentional injury (accidents), Malignant Neoplasms (cancer), and Congenital Anomalies (abnormality at birth) accounted for more than half (63.35 percent) of all deaths among kids (ages 5 through 9) in 2002.  Note that automobile accident is the number one cause of death in this age group, accounting for about 21%.<br>

<p>See Table 6 for &#8220;Ranking and percentage of leading mechanisms of unintentional injury death, by age group and race/ethnicity   &mdash;   United States 1999-2002&#8221;  It is an image that I can&rsquo;t figure out how to paste in the comments box.<br>
Tables 7, 9 and 11 are illuminating as well.  Clearly differences among races for causes of death and for homicides choice of methods.  BTW American Indians are off the charts.  </p>

		<p>Blacks were brought here, and American &#8216;Indians&rsquo; were pushed onto small enclaves, and failed to adapt to White ways. Just as Whites would generally, in LARGE populations, fail to adapt to Asian behavior. Whites would &#8216;stand out&rsquo; which would be very dangerous in Asian countries.</p>
<p>I have seen young blacks, they are very interesting because they can &#8220;bull&#8221; with adults, talk about how dey going to be doctors, or this or that, (when they are 5 or 6) and they can make you think they really are very bright, because they talk TO adults LIKE adults, at that early an age. These are non-ghetto raised blacks.<br>
Very entertaining. When they hit the all-white high school, watch out though. Hang out WAY back of the line, shufflin by themselves, looking out of place. Africa kicks in, they are literally ON THE MOON in White civilization. 50,000 years evolutionary differences MAKES a difference.</p>

		<p>As a demographic, Black parental irresponsibility cannot be denied.  The simple and effective act of ensuring a child&rsquo;s seat belted is forgone.  There can be no racial excuses of a legacy of slavery or institutional racism in these cases. This is a personal act solely for the benefit of one&rsquo;s children.  Ethnic differences, across a wide number of personal care behaviors, are well known in the health care industry.  This includes, but not limited to the widely publicized issues of smoking, drinking, sugar intake, other dietary behaviors, as well as TV watching, reading, and risky sex.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackradionetwork.com/few_blacks_wear_seatbelts" rel="nofollow">https://www.blackradionetwork.com/few_blacks_wear_seatbelts</a></p>
<p>&#8220;According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), the No. 1 leading cause of unintentional injury death for all Blacks is motor vehicle crashes. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for Blacks ages 1 to 14. Of those killed while passengers in a vehicle, 52 percent of Black children were not restrained at the time of the crash. Though wearing a seat belt is the best way to avoid injury.&#8221;</p>
