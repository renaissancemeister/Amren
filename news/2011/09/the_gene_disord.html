<h1><a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1054978">The Gene Disorder That Makes You Smell</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Norton, The Star, September 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For some people with troublesome, unexplained body odor, an uncommon genetic disorder once known as &#8220;fish-odor syndrome&#8221; may be to blame, according to a study.</p>
<p>The condition, known clinically as trimethylaminuria, is caused by emitting excessive amounts of the compound trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is produced when people digest foods rich in a substance called choline  &mdash;  including saltwater fish, eggs, liver and certain legumes, such as soy and kidney beans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Individuals with the metabolic disorder trimethylaminuria may sporadically produce malodors despite good hygiene,&#8221; wrote study leader Paul Wise, at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, in the American Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Trimethylaminuria is caused by defects in a gene known as FMO3, which hinder the body&rsquo;s ability to metabolize TMA and turn it into odor-free compounds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For someone to have the disorder, he or she must inherit a defective copy of the FMO3 gene from both parents, who themselves would be unaffected &#8220;carriers.&#8221; Of course, if either of the parents had the disorder, they would also pass it on.</p>
<p>Studies in the UK have estimated that up to 1 percent of white people carry a flawed copy of FMO3, with some ethnic groups  &mdash;  including people from Ecuador and New Guinea  &mdash;  having a higher rate.</p>
<p>For the current study, Wise and his colleagues looked at how often trimethylaminuria was diagnosed in patients who came to Monell seeking help for unexplained, persistent body odor.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[<em>Editor&rsquo;s Note: Studies on racial differences in the prevalence of trimethylaminuria are available <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9110361">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934311004931">here</a>.</em>]</p>

		<p>1968 - I was a 10 year old transplant from all white Follansbee West Virginia to a more &#8220;mixed&#8221; Halifax County Virginia. I tried to make friends with the local black kids by asking them questions about their thoughts on white people. I&rsquo;ll never forget when John Scott told me that &#8220;White People&rsquo;s wet hair smells like a wet chicken!&#8221; Being less than a typical accommodating liberal, I said that it was better to smell like a wet chicken than to wreak like a rotting dead animal such as black people. Needless to say, we had a fight! I busted his nose and that was the last of our &#8220;civil&#8221; banter!</p>

		<p>The Baker reference does not merely highlight the difference in<br>
Black / White body odor but how unbearably intense such odor can<br>
be.  I am at monthly intervals  on campus at a major inland USA university that has a high incidence of students from China.  One sees a small degree of White male/Chinese female social pairing.  I have yet to see a single instance of Black/Chinese pairing and almost no instance of Chinese having any physical proximity to Blacks for any appreciable period of time.  Reportedly, the Chinese find Blacks often unpleasantly smelly.  The Chinese are educated in a yet nominally Marxist nation and have no encouragement in their pre-university schooling to be biologically realistic about race.  </p>

		<p>Observation suggests that a noteworthy part of the Black body odor<br>
problem may be the &#8220;g&#8221; factor.  What passes for diet in America generally and in particular what characterizes so much observable Black &#8220;gulp and go&#8221; food intake  &mdash;  this is a very important exacerbation to whatever is written into the genes.  From an evolutionary standpoint, Blacks are &#8220;unfavored and long away from home&#8221;  when facing what&rsquo;s on the paper plate in America&hellip;and clueless. </p>

		<p>during WWII the allies developed a chemical that mimiced body oder.  gave it the code name &#8220;Who,me&#8221; and would put it on the clothes of axis diplomats and other enemy officals causing them to smell badly.  It stands to reason that different races would smell different.  I recall a young man in college that I could not stand to be around because of the odd way he smelled.  the smell roused my anger and I would wonder what the hell he was wearing.</p>

		<p>I understand that blacks emit more waste from they sweat glands,and less from they kidneys,as compared to us. Maybe thats part of why they have so much kidney trouble later in life. That may explain the &#8220;musky odor&#8221; often encountered. </p>

<p>Before my parents sent me to a White Flight private academy in Dixieland, they naively sent me to our local public school.  One of my most profound memories in life is that of the first afternoon I got on the public school bus and was hit by the most noxious fumes of concentrated Africanism imaginable.  </p>
<p>Soon thereafter, I was safely enrolled in a Whites Only private school and never sat next to another one of the blacks for the next several glorious years of my life.  I&rsquo;ve been firmly committed to anti-Diversity ever since that day after school when I encountered one of the horrifying sensate manifestations of Diversity.</p>

		<p>I remember mentioning to a &#8216;Diversity Official&rsquo; in the Tier 1 East Coast, private moneybags university I tuaght in, when I was called on the carpet for making some comment (to an &#8220;Afreakin-Amurrican&#8221; student, about how different races&rsquo; physiognomies mean different emphases in training for musical careers, that &#8216;that was just a racist statement.&#8221; I didn&rsquo;t have the corroborative evidence then, but I do now. And your site told me about Avdeyev&rsquo;s &#8220;Raciology&#8221; which is firmly in my bookcase now&hellip;.</p>
<p>But, all of this &#8216;discussion&rsquo; sounds as &#8216;racist&rsquo; to me, (and I concur with you all!) as did my statement to that University Diversicrat&hellip;. so we have a lot of work to do. </p>
<p>But I do remember my Parochial School 8th Grade teacher. (who was black, and smoked cigars) It was astounding for me to find out, at 13, in my first contact with a black, that his skin just &#8216;stank&rsquo; - no matter WHAT he did. And it turned me off to Blacks for some time. Reading that others noted this, I am glad to have my opinions confirmed. I just thought for forty years, I was merely being &#8216;racist&rsquo; instead of knowing that &#8220;&hellip; a rose by any other name&#8221; still has to be a ROSE, to &#8216;smell as sweet!&rsquo;</p>

		<p>An element of delu-sphere in America is body odor.  In frontier<br>
America people often went for several days without bathing but, absent illness, generally did not have repellant body odor by<br>
virtue of lots of fresh water consumption in conjunction with physical activity and a diet shy of processed foods, etc., and by airing out clothing at night, stringently washing clothing, applying vinegar to odor zones, etc.  In &#8220;our&#8221; bubble world,<br>
a conformity of standardized soap and deodorant not merely obscures many useful natural odors but seems over time to make<br>
unnatural anything that does not smell like, say, Lever Brothers <br>
or Proctor and Gamble.  Don&rsquo;t tell Morri$ Dee$ he should launch<br>

		<p>Re 18<br>
The folklore of many cultures report dogs having an uncanny ability to discriminate by smell the persons in a village who<br>
are otherwise known to humans in the community to be asocial/psychotic.  Given the very strong biological basis of some major mental disorders, it is not implausible.  Man&rsquo;s bigot? or<br>

		<p>Some small extent of smell based &#8220;us/them&#8221; signals necessarily<br>
concern something that is an important part of the miracle of human adaptation by way of evolution  &mdash;  namely, the approximately<br>
four day, monthly seepage away of an unused (non impregnated)<br>
uterine lining in order to become, yet again, motherhood ready.<br>
Having seen in my youth the occasional unobjectionable use of chewing tobacco in proper settings ( using a large flannel &#8220;handkerchief&#8221; to lip seep tobacco saliva ), I was informed that<br>
women readily suggested this accommodation.  In either case, lip seepage from above or below, a flannel cloth folded over and folded over &amp; over, provides in the matter of menses a clear<br>
indication of the sequence and amount of discharge.  The obvious medical safeguard value of this seems totally unregarded in favor of a vast shelf space of &#8220;feminine hygiene&#8221; products.  Smell terror appears to have won over and against rational  tolerance.  How can an intelligent young woman be expected to be other than a creationist?  Who could believe males could have endured women that didn&rsquo;t have the contemporary &#8220;gift$&#8221; of feminine hygiene product$?     <br>
