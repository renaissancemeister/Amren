<h1>Perry: &#8220;I Don&rsquo;t Think You Have a Heart&#8221; If You Oppose In-State Tuition for Children of Illegal Immigrants</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John McCormack, Weekly Standard, September 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>During Thursday night&rsquo;s Republican presidential debate, Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum all took shots at Rick Perry&rsquo;s record on illegal immigration. Bachmann said that Texas&rsquo;s law allowing in-state tuition for the children of illegal immigrants acted like a &#8220;magnet&#8221; for illegal immigrants. Perry&rsquo;s response was forceful and personal. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think you have a heart,&#8221; Perry told his critics.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say that we should not educate children who come into our state for no other reason than that they&rsquo;ve been brought their through no fault of their own, I don&rsquo;t think you have a heart,&#8221; Perry said. &#8220;We need to be educating these children because they will become a drag on our society. I think that&rsquo;s what Texans wanted to do. Out of 181 members of the Texas legislature when this issue came up [there were] only four dissenting votes. This was a state issue. Texas voted on it. And I still support it today.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think you have a brain if you are willing to overlook the children who were born in the US in favor of people who were not. My parents worked and saved to put me through a BA. What&rsquo;s wrong with illegal parents doing the same? </p>

		<p>Count me out as a Perry supporter. The other day I saw a Mexican family in the local grocery store all wearing Texas A&M; t-shirts.<br>
I wonder how many deserving white American students are going to be denied admission to top flight state universities to make way for our new citizens? Rick old boy I HOPE you read this or at least one of your campaign workers, which I would grant, is very unlikely. You just lost a vote. No true American Patriot could support a policy like this. Let Mexico educate its own people. Don&rsquo;t ask American and State taxpayers to do it for them. We need to start sending them all home. Even if their feelings get a little hurt. </p>

		<p>I DO have a heart, for my fellow citizens who can&rsquo;t find work, whose children are denied scholarships because they don&rsquo;t fit the minority profile. For our vanishing middle class on which this country was built. I&rsquo;m very disturbed and disgusted at the way our ruling elites sold us out to corporations, other countries and the UN. I&rsquo;m angry at our politicians sense of entitlement, deviousness and outright corruption.</p>
<p>Rick Perry has some nerve, accusing the American people who oppose illegal immigration of not having a heart. How lame to try and play the shame card. We have a lot of illegals who have skirted our laws and are drawing all kinds of benefits from this country like we have a never ending money source and no deficit.</p>
<p>I hope Perry does not win the nomination. We need a realistic leader with common sense who has the courage to close our borders and enforce stringent immigration policies. He&rsquo;s lost my vote. </p>

		<p>The Rickroller was hypocritical last night.  On the one hand, he says we don&rsquo;t need physical border security (fences, walls, troops, etc) because all we need to do is remove the benefit magnets, and no illegals would come and most here would self-deport.  (A supposition which I buy into less and less the more I read and understand about Latin America).  On the other hand, he says stuff like this   &mdash;   What is in-state tuition for illegals if not a benefit magnet?</p>
<p>The more Rickroller opens his mouth, the lower he gets in the polls.  He&rsquo;ll lose frontrunner status after the next debate, at this rate.</p>
<p>I said this in another story from yesterday, but it bears repeating because this is a story from last night&rsquo;s debate.  </p>
<p>I have to address this Ron Paul hobby horse head on, about a fence that could keep them out is one that could keep us in.  That&rsquo;s true in theory, but here in the practical reality and history of the real world, border security is only used for the intended purpose of its creators.  The Berlin Wall was built to keep Easterners in, and while it &ldquo;could&rdquo; have been used to keep Westerners out, for propaganda purposes, the Eastern Bloc openly welcomed West-to-East defectors, the few that there were.  A real physical set of walls, fences or troops at the Mexican border would only be put there with the intent to keep them out, and therefore, that&rsquo;s all it would be used for.  And besides, what kind of American would want to flee to Mexico anyway, other than someone on the lam?  I suppose Ron Paul has never heard of airline flights  &mdash;  They can easily scale fences and walls.</p>

		<p>Gov. Perry&rsquo;s critics may be heartless, but at least they are not brainless, as is the Governor and his 177 sidekicks, as well as those in the audience who applauded Govenor Perry, and even Santorum, who expressed a belief that illegals should be able to go to college in the U.S.  Santorum had a great opportunity to stand up for White America, but he just couldn&rsquo;t do it. Honestly, I wouldn&rsquo;t care if every Mexican, Asian, and Black person were smarter or better educated than all the Whites on earth, I just do not wish to be in the same nation with them, no matter what. </p>

		<p>I still wish the other candidates had pounded Perry a little harder on illegal immigration. They could have really embarrassed him on several things he has done in the past. Also, I would like to know what the point of giving illegals tuition breaks is, when they can&rsquo;t work here legally? I would have loved to see him try and explain that one. If this clown gets the Republican nomination, guess I&rsquo;ll stay home on election day because I certainly won&rsquo;t vote for him, and Obama is out of the question as well.</p>

<p>Interesting you mention Texas A&M.;  As you might know, they want to leave the Big 12 and join the SEC.  I read a MSM article that in order to pony up the $30 million or so exit fee the Big 12 will want, A&M;&rsquo;s going to pass the hat among its well to do alumni, and they figure that several really rich ones will pony up most of those 30 megabucks.  </p>
<p>Here you go   &mdash;   A few really rich people will shell out the lion&rsquo;s share of $30m over a triviality that is which conference its sports teams should belong do, but those same (all white, I&rsquo;m sure) rich alums won&rsquo;t give AR $30 to save their own race.</p>
<p>Obama is popping off about rich people need to pay more taxes.  Uncle Sam won&rsquo;t see any of that $30 million that A&M;&rsquo;s AD raises, because A&M; is a &#8220;tax exempt&#8221; institution.  At the very least, Obama could push for taking the 501-c-x status away from the sports programs of colleges and universities.  I doubt he will because college sports, particularly football and men&rsquo;s basketball, are, as SBPDL keeps reminding us, one of the few ways that black men get positive media images.  That and Obama&rsquo;s brother-in-law is a college basketball head coach, and Obama himself is obsessed with brackets and all that.</p>

		<p>5 Question Diversity - What Paul was getting at was that there are several examples of laws being interpreted and enforced in ways that were not intended. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>1. Gold was made illegal under the Trading With the Enemy Act.</p>
<p>2. The RICO law was intended to fight organized crime but has been used against legitimate businesses.</p>
<p>3. The Patriot Act was used to prosecute someone for illegally selling baby formula.</p>
<p>4. Who can forget the Constitutional amendment that gave former slaves citizenship has been extended to anchor babies.</p>
<p>Somehow during the Eisenhower years we were able to control illegal immigration without a fence and government IDs. Of course back then we didn&rsquo;t actually reward illegal aliens.</p>

<p>But facts and good mean nothing to a money-whore.</p>
<p>Still, better this whore than four more years of Obama, Eric Holder, etc. God, please, NO!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get behind the best candidate, but if Perry gets the nod, let&rsquo;s steamroll Obama, then get to holding the Republican traitor&rsquo;s feet to the fire. <br>
Remember, we can NOT hold Obama to anything. He actually hates us.<br>

		<p>I sincerely hope that GOP voters don&rsquo;t nominate this clown.  Since Rick Perry likes illegal immigrants so much, perhaps he should make a &#8220;run for the border&#8221; rather than for the Presidency of the US.  We all know, though, that no matter who gets the nomination, immigration will be put on the back burner and nothing will ultimately get done about it.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of when I was an undergrad.  I moved to a different state and waited a full year to establish residency within that state and then resumed my studies.  While at that university, there was talk of eliminating in-state tuition for foreign students.  There were protests in which students compared this proposal to the Nazi Holocaust.  Asking someone from China or Brazil to pay the same non-resident tuition as someone from Michigan or Texas is the equivalent of mass genocide?  </p>

		<p>#3 The fact that you supported Rick Perry up until now is a sad commentary on the ignorance of some people who are not ashamed of their heritage and happen to be white.</p>
<p>Perry&rsquo;s been doing this since 2001 at least, and his policies have not changed. Judging from your name, you seem to be a Texan. If that&rsquo;s the case, then my verdict of your ignorance is even more damning: you live in the place and still have no clue what policies he is pushing?</p>
<p>The only non-crazy candidate who will be okayish on this issue is Romney, but he is a flipflopper: which means that he will be more likely to pander to his base(not a bad thing in the end).</p>
<p>Bachmann is probably best on this single issue but she is so crazy on all other levels that she simply is unelectable anyway to a general public. </p>
<p>I do note that Commentary Magazine, the supposed bastion of neo-liberals(whoops, conservatives!), mourns the fall of Rick Perry after each debate, and several of their writers even stated that &#8216;anybody who cares about the GOP&rsquo; would support Perry&rsquo;s immigration issue and that &#8216;the base don&rsquo;t want this&rsquo; (which is exactly why we must never debate these issues, according to their logic).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also noteworthy that the other neo-liberal(whoops, neo-conservative!) rag that is the Weekly Standard refused to allow comments for their piece.</p>
<p>The main problem is who controls the &#8216;conservative&rsquo; media, not the candidates. The media frames the debates and the neo-liberal media(Commentary, National Review, Weekly Standard etc) are all open-border types of liberals(oh, I meant, &#8216;conservatives&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Only once the media situation is cleaned up can we have decent, intelligent candidates on immigration.</p>

		<p>Well, let me wade in here&hellip;</p>
<p>One of the first things Governor Perry did after coming to office in Texas was to remove a plaque in the building that houses the Texas Supreme Court.  Years ago that building was financed by monies from the Texas Confederate Widows Fund.</p>
<p>When the building was deeded over to the Texas Supreme Court, a proviso stated that a plaque was to be permanently displayed that would state the source of the funds used to put up the building.  I.e. the Confederacy and the link thereof to Texas and Texas Confederate Widows of the Honored Texas Confederate Dead.</p>
<p>Time passes&hellip;</p>
<p>Gov. Perry (aka &#8216;Governor Good Hair&rsquo; [thank you Molly Ivins, wherever you are]) came into office.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter a black guy in Austin, Texas, by the name of Gary Johnson (????) got on his hobby horse to complain that the plaque was racist, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>Consternation followed, with the appropriate gashing of teeth and great wailing.</p>
<p>Gov. Quick Rick settled the issue by having the plaque removed in the deep of night over a weekend by evil minions unknown.  </p>
<p>Reportedly the plaque still exists but no one can find it, even in the deepest, darkest bowels of the state government.</p>
<p>In so doing, Gov. Good Hair gave the finger to the Texas members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans and all white people.</p>
<p>It is at this point in my narrative that you need to start keeping track of the colours&hellip;</p>
<p>To the issue in hand&hellip;in-state tuition&hellip;</p>
<p>Gov. Perry signed into law the bill allowing illegal children domiciled in Texas to pay in-state tuition at our colleges and universities.  So far, so good&hellip;</p>
<p>It is my understanding that an illegal child domiciled in New Mexico only pays in-state tuition in colleges and universities in New Mexico.</p>
<p>If this same illegal child applies to and is accepted by a Texas college or university, I would imagine this same child would have to pay out-of-state tuition to his or her college or university in Texas.</p>
<p>But for some reason I am unable to state, I suspect that the child&rsquo;s mere status as an illegal qualifies him or her to in-state tuition in Texas, even though the child is from out-of- state.  Am I wrong here?  Anybody know?</p>
<p>So a white legal child from Oklahoma or New Mexico pays out-of-state tuition to Texas to attend one of our schools in-state.</p>
<p>So Gov. Good Hair loves the Mexican people more than he loves his own people - be they white, black, yellow, polka-dot or Canadian.  (We have a river in Texas named the Canadian River - I am not talking about the Polar Bear Canadians).</p>
<p>So my question to Gov. Perry is:  If you love the Mexican people more than you love your own people, do you love the Chinese people more than you love the Mexican people?  And do you love the Congolese people more than you do the Chinese people?  And do you love the Brazilian people more than you love the Congolese people?  You can see where this is going.</p>
<p>With apologies to Telly Savallas, the question becomes: &#8220;Who do you love, Baby?&#8221;.  Obviously, it&rsquo;s not your own people.</p>
<p>P.S. I am pretty sure Gov. Rick is a CFR member. </p>

		<p>It was surprising to hear &#8220;git er done Perry&#8221; say something so without heart or mind.  How about a little heart  for all the parents who saved for 10 or 20 years for their children&rsquo;s college education who are a little short because of the poor markets.  Why not use these subsidies to help them, in or out of state.  If Perry doesn&rsquo;t help them he doesn&rsquo;t have a heart. Many of their fathers and grandfathers have fought for their countries.  Some died.  Rick Perry, you don&rsquo;t have a heart.  Some might call you a low life.  I might agree.</p>
<p>To rub salt in the wound he would of course favor affirmative action for past wrongs!!!!.</p>

		<p>Perry has to come up with some excuse for the behavior he used to get Hispanic votes in Texas.  But, when he starts sounding like a liberal, his feet are on shifting sand in the GOP.  But, since the MSM are feverishly trying to prop him up in order to assure a worthless Republican candidate, we may have to wait for a couple of primaries to be rid of him.</p>

<p>Perry using that tired old canard? Never their fault, is it? Poor little kids. How about some compassion for OUR White kids who will have to reap a brown Texas thanks to people like Perry.</p>
<p>Guess Texans aren&rsquo;t as great as they have been portrayed. What has happened to those once great White Texan men? Wonder if the Texas Rangers feel the same as Perry?</p>
<p>The Republicans will lose this race if they keep what they have put up so far. But of course, the GOP is not White friendly any longer and hasn&rsquo;t been for a long time. I will go 3rd party again. But most Whites will still vote for one of the two parties and that is a shame. Look where it has gotten us.</p>

		<p>#13 - Good question and I will attempt to give you a Texans perspective.</p>
<p> I moved here over a decade ago and one of the first things I did was visit the Capitol and the monuments surrounding it. Upon looking at the dedication to the Alamo - I was completely struck by the amount of hispanic names chiseled into the granite. Over the years I have met many with Hispanic names that appear as white as I. Streets, towns, restaurants, schools, bars etc etc adorn hispanic names everywhere you go. While the majority of white conservative Texans wish for demographic stability, it is understood that it would be political suicide to take a very harsh stance when it comes to immigration - both legal and illegal.</p>
<p>Bush &amp; Perry are essentially prototypes of what we have seen and can expect of any Republicans that hail from the great state of Texas. They will appeal to conservatives but will fail those of us wishing for a stand against this illegal invasion. </p>
<p>The more I think of it, the more I agree with those that believe the breakup of this country is inevitable. </p>

		<p>We should all be deliriously happy that Perry came out with this insanity now. He just lost any support he might have had. What is it with Texas governors that makes them forget anyone but Mexicans exist? He thinks it&rsquo;s heartless to deny benefitss to the children of people who laugh at our laws. Wonder if he would subsidize a college education for the children of American criminals? Or I think there is an election coming up in Mexico.

		<p>27-Dying Breed: &#8220;Upon looking at the dedication to the Alamo - I was completely struck by the amount of hispanic names chiseled into the granite.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I would contend that the Hispanics at the Alamo were ANTI-Mexican and PRO-Texan, whereas today, the Mexicans who are flooding into our country are PRO-Mexican and ANTI-American. 165 years has made a great difference in the makeup of just who is in the Great State of Texas.  As such, I feel your comment does not sufficiently make the needed distinction.</p>
<p>And: &#8220;While the majority of white conservative Texans wish for DEMOGRAPHIC STABILITY, it is understood that it would be POLITICAL SUICIDE to take a very harsh stance when it comes to immigration - both legal and illegal.&#8221; (my emphasis)</p>
<p>- You have hit, exactly, the critical point of this debate. This is exactly the choice which Texans, and the rest of us, are being given: We have the option to either continue our current immigration policy and guarantee a political suicide - the political destruction of America wherein the ethnic groups break up America into ethno-states due to demographic instability, or, we have demographic stability and ensure the political survival of America as a Nation-State.</p>
<p>- We can not wish for demographic stability in the face of massive non-White immigration and still expect to maintain the political survival of the Nation-State of America.  No where in world history to humans behave in such a manner.</p>
<p>- In other words, we cannot have it all-ways: We can not have massive immigration AND demographic stability.  We can not have demographic instability and the political stability of the nation state.  It just doesn&rsquo;t work that way in the long run. What we are doing is guaranteeing the increasing, worsening, never-ending problem of ethnic instability, which will eventually cause political instability and failure. And all due to our ignorant and arrogant policy of allowing massive non-White immigration. </p>
<p>And also: &#8220;The more I think of it, the more I agree with those that believe the breakup of this country is inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I believe we are of the same line of thought in this regard. Texas may well once again become its own republic, but if so, it appears it will lean much more to the Mexican side than to the American side.<br>
 <br>

<p>The big news here, other than Herman Cain winning (What the&hellip;?) is that Perry finished way back in 2nd with 15%.  This is significant because Florida Governor Rick Scott has been popping off all week about how the winner of this straw poll was probably going to be the Republican nominee (wonder if he still thinks that now?), and he was mainly saying that because he has quasi-endorsed Perry (&#8220;he&rsquo;s got a cool first name&#8221;), and thought he would win.</p>
<p>His open borders positions really cost him among Florida Republicans.</p>

		<p>Most of you apparently haven&rsquo;t spent much time in Texas. Those of us who call this great state home have no doubts whatsoever about Governor Perry&rsquo;s attitude toward Mexicans or the border. Those of us who have been paying attention don&rsquo;t believe the talking points that those Yankee candidates from PA, MN, and MA keep spewing out.</p>
<p>Mr. Perry is well aware that a border fence is just plain stupid. A simple internet search of the existing border fences will pull up dozens of videos of people climbing over or cutting through the fences. Our governor understands that a fence would probably  keep Canadian frostbacks from invading Michele Bachmann&rsquo;s home state, but it won&rsquo;t keep Mexicans out of the Southwest.</p>
<p>Mr. Perry has spent 400 million dollars of our state&rsquo;s revenues to do the federal government&rsquo;s job of protecting the border. He sent Texas Rangers to help patrol the areas with the highest traffic of drugs and illegals. He has learned that the only thing that will control our southern border is a great many boots on the ground and surveillance from the air.</p>
<p>Those of you who are grumbling about the in-state tuition rate for children of illegal aliens are obviously not aware that we don&rsquo;t have a state income tax in Texas. Our state is supported by our sales tax, our property tax and our fuel tax. Everybody in Texas contributes to our state coffers. Businessmen, welders, machinists, doctors, barbers, politicians and even illegal aliens and their children all kick in. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons the state representatives we sent to Austin voted overwhelmingly to give the brown kids who sat in class next to our kids the same tuition rate that our kids get.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Mexicans were part of Texas before Texas was Texas. Keep in mind, also, that every single day of the week I see Texas Mexicans, maybe legal, maybe not, doing jobs that I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have to do. Mr. Perry echoed the opinion of the vast majority of non-retarded Texans when he signed that bill into law:  If we can&rsquo;t shoot the illegals, then let&rsquo;s turn them into useful Americans and shut down the border so we don&rsquo;t have to educate any more of them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t judge Perry too harshly until you consider that one of the primary planks in the Constitutional Conservative platform is State&rsquo;s Rights. Our governor&rsquo;s and legislators&rsquo; actions in this matter are an excellent example of what State&rsquo;s Rights is all about. Our tuition law may not be good for any other state, but I think it will benefit Texas in the long run. You&rsquo;d have to live here to understand that.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways: You either support the 10th Amendment or you don&rsquo;t. State&rsquo;s rights means that they can have Socialized Medicine in Massachusetts, queers marrying queers in  many Blue States and in-state tuition rates for the illegal alien kids who earned a spot in our Texas universities. </p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t support state&rsquo;s rights, then you are no different than the nosy Yankees who sent the troops to shove Governor Wallace out of the way when he was blocking the doors at the U of A.</p>

		<p>What I find really odd about this issue is the common refrain among some of these &#8220;conservative&#8221; candidates that if we don&rsquo;t give illegal immigrants a college education, they&rsquo;ll end up on welfare. College? Welfare? THEY&rsquo;RE ILLEGALS! As soon as they&rsquo;re identified as being in this country illegally, they should be arrested and, ultimately, deported. What am I missing? Isn&rsquo;t law enforcement at all levels OBLIGATED to enforce the law? Why are they pretending that illegals are not breaking the law?</p>

		<p>#36 BannerRWB - you are spot on with my perceptions concerning those that gave their lives at the Alamo and of those we find loitering outside the home improvement stores these days. I believe the hispanics which gave their lives then, would be appalled with what they would see now. I have to believe the racial make-up coming from Mexico these days to be far different as well.</p>
<p>As far as Rick Perry goes &hellip;&hellip;.. </p>
<p>He may not be as ignorant as many want to believe. For instance, I grew up a Red Sox fan and naturally despised the Yankees. There is a bumper sticker that states: &#8220;My two favorite teams are the Red Sox AND whoever is playing the Yankees&#8221;. This is a bold move that could very well gain more votes than he may lose. Mr Perry may just know me better than I know myself - come November <br>
2012 - should it be Perry vs Obama - who do you think I will vote for?</p>
<p>Who would you vote for?</p>

<p>Thanks to the important   &mdash;   no, make that <i>crucial</i>   &mdash;   information that AmRen has provided about the Rickroller&rsquo;s (h/t: QD) ultra-liberal mentality, I have been disgusted by Perry&rsquo;s candidacy for several months now. (I live nowhere near Texas and was not familiar with Gov. Good Hair prior to his presidential aspirations.) So this assertion comes as no surprise to me. </p>
<p>But what I would like to add to the debate is that I don&rsquo;t want to hear ANY candidates, on ANY issue, framing the debate in terms of &#8220;having a heart.&#8221; At the risk of making myself sound completely &#8220;uncompassionate&#8221; and, well, &#8220;heartless&#8221;, I find it insulting to my intelligence that someone who wants to prove to me that they&rsquo;re capable of holding the tremendously demanding job of being POTUS, with appeals to my &#8220;heart.&#8221; The notion of &#8220;governing from the heart&#8221; might impress sandal-footed Eloi and helmet-wearing Beta-males, but to any normal red-blooded American man it sounds like surrender. It&rsquo;s the sound of somebody who waves the white flag <i>even when it&rsquo;s not necessary.</i> It&rsquo;s bad enough that major Democrats talk like Oprah; it&rsquo;s utterly terrifying that Texas Republicans do as well. </p>
<p>&#8220;Having a heart&#8221; means prioritizing emotion over reason. Taking about &#8220;matters of the heart&#8221; makes Perry sound weak, touchy-feely, and mush-brained. To be blunt, it makes him sound like a WOMAN (the wise and wonderful women of AR like Bon From The Land of Babble, Margaret and Olewhitelady are, of course, excluded from this criticism, no offense, gals). </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a handy tip for whenever you hear a politician using the word &#8220;heart&#8221;: in your head, you should hear it as &#8220;BLEEDING heart,&#8221; e.g. &#8220;If you oppose in-state tuition for children of illegal immigrants, you don&rsquo;t have a BLEEDING heart.&#8221; </p>
<p>No, Gov. Perry, I don&rsquo;t have a bleeding heart   &mdash;   and I&rsquo;m proud of that fact. I&rsquo;m proud that I have the opposite of a bleeding heart: a functioning brain. </p>
<p>How about yourself, Governor? </p>

<p>Your response is true, but moot.  Here in the real world, the kind of people who want to construct that Leviathan state also oppose physical border security at the US-Mexico border, and not coincidentally, I might add.   The kind of people who want the border security also oppose the Leviathan state, again, not a coincidence.  Leviathan worshipers need massive non-white immigration and a browning America to help make their dreams come true, and likewise, in our idea of a relatively controlled government (though not necessarily Anarcho-Capitalist), we need America to stay as white as possible.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really worried about border security being used to keep us in simply because it wouldn&rsquo;t have that intent at first, you really shouldn&rsquo;t worry that much.  The only way the border fence/wall/troops ever happens is if we gain power, and we wouldn&rsquo;t want the Leviathan state anyway.  If we don&rsquo;t gain power, the border wall will never get built, and Leviathan will grow.</p>
<p>Likewise, theoretical models can be used to &#8220;prove&#8221; anything.  If the summer was hot, there&rsquo;s a model that proves that man-made global warming is happening, and there&rsquo;s also a model that proves that AGW isn&rsquo;t happening.  If the winter was cold, same deal.  If it was 72 and sunny in Malibu yesterday, same deal.  There are models that prove that the &#8220;official&#8221; 9/11 story was true, there are models that prove that the official 9/11 story cannot possibly be true.  Point is, global climate and 9/11 didn&rsquo;t happen in the realm of theoretical models, they happened in the real world.</p>

		<p>Beck and Perry believe in the same &#8220;gods&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>An excerpt from an article I found very interesting.</p>
<p>a huge revival meeting, in which Beck implored America to turn back to the god(s) of our Jewish-Christian-Muslim-Hindu-Mormon-Voodoo-Sikh-Zoroastrian heritage that made America great. He had over 200 members of the clergy on the podium, and he stressed that they were from &ldquo;all faiths&rdquo; and it didn&rsquo;t matter which god we pray to, as long as we pray to something or someone, singular or plural. Just pick a higher power and go with it. In other words, it was the largest Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in history. Listen as Beck tells the crowd to &ldquo;go back to your church, your synagogue, your mosque&rdquo; and get to work on &ldquo;refounding America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, normally, evangelicals would be horrified at this pantheism of &ldquo;America needs to turn back to god, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter which god&rdquo; on full display Saturday, at a huge revival meeting led by America&rsquo;s most famous Mormon. But not anymore. Judging by the posts and comments on the website of America&rsquo;s biggest Christian news magazine, they ate it up. One columnist pretty much compared Glenn Beck to Jesus:</p>
<p>    We arrived an hour late. The entire reflecting pool area of the National Mall was packed. The adjacent fields were packed, and the tide stretched toward the Washington Monument. The Associated Press has reported that &ldquo;tens of thousands&rdquo; were there. That kind of cynical numbers-downplaying reminded me of Heidi&rsquo;s Romans 8:28 observation and made me glad that every lie will come out in the wash eventually. They lied about Jesus the whole of his ministry. And after he was raised, which was the ultimate vindication, they paid off soldiers to spread the rumor that his body had been stolen. But as the Bible says, &ldquo;No weapon forged against you shall prosper&rdquo; (Isaiah 54:17).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the Beck Heads and Tea Partiers are losing their country. Not because they don&rsquo;t attend their local mosque often enough. But they can&rsquo;t admit that, because that would be &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, and losing your country is a lot better than being called &ldquo;racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>

		<p>One concern is that Mexicans, like other minorities, are allowed into colleges with lower SAT scores.  This means that in Texas, you now have Mexicans nationals with poor SAT scores entering state colleges at in-state tuition.  To allow these weak-scoring foreigners in, the statistics say you must be displacing a better-scoring white American citizen.  Students with poor SAT scores are much more likely to drop out because they find college-level course work too hard.  The better scoring white American citizens, robbed of their chance to enter college, would actually be more likely to finish and get a degree. </p>
<p>This is patently unjust and unfair.  Allowing illegals into college at in-state tuition is crazy, especially when they&rsquo;re already getting the unfair advantage of SAT inflation.  What&rsquo;s worse is that other Mexican nationals in the US still get this SAT inflation advantage at colleges all over the US, even ignoring the tuition problem.  Minorities also have scholarships set aside solely for them.</p>

<p>What garbage is this? A die hard Perry fan&hellip;as for a fence not being a deterrent I beg to differ!  Look at that Israeli &#8220;fence&#8221; WE paid for! It sure does stop the unwanted from entering. </p>
<p>DENY all services to illegals, food stamps jobs, free medical, free education, section 8 and on and on and you will see SELF-deportation and then build the kind of fence that will stop anyone from entering. Then blow up all those tunnels they are so fond of building.  We can STOP anything (including drugs)from coming across our borders! It is people like you and Perry who try to tell us we can&rsquo;t while dishing out freebies in the same breath! </p>

		<p>It was gratifying to see Perry getting nailed hard in the FLA straw polls.  Maybe the others will get the message and actually show some guts on this issue.  A few rewarded rather than villified forays along these lines might embolden the rest to start a competitive dialogue about immigration.  I&rsquo;ll bet the MSM tries to shut down discussion of &#8216;no heart&rsquo; so this doesn&rsquo;t get out of their control.  </p>

		<p>#38 What a bloated argument. Are you working for his campaign?<br>
Of course a *wall* can be enforced, if done correctly. Which means making it 10 meters high or higher, as well as going well into the ground.</p>
<p>Also, why are you not even talking about the fact that they are there illegally? Or the fact that they are significantly dumbing down America as well as replacing Europeans at a rapid clip.</p>
<p>None of this seems to concern you. You&rsquo;re either stupid, a troll or a campaigner for Perry.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Berlin Wall was built to keep Easterners in, and while it &ldquo;could&rdquo; have been used to keep Westerners out, for propaganda purposes, the Eastern Bloc openly welcomed West-to-East defectors, the few that there were. A real physical set of walls, fences or troops at the Mexican border would only be put there with the intent to keep them out, and therefore, that&rsquo;s all it would be used for. And besides, what kind of American would want to flee to Mexico anyway, other than someone on the lam? I suppose Ron Paul has never heard of airline flights  &mdash;  They can easily scale fences and walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides which, there are always people whom we would want it to keep in (how many crime dramas end with a mad dash towards Mexico?)</p>
<p>The Berlin wall also was intended to keep Western agents and spies out, and indeed special forces. </p>

<p>- Granted, I too would not care to wash dishes (for example) for a living, and I respect those who do so.  All the same, it isn&rsquo;t that many Mexicans are not hard working, it&rsquo;s that they are here in the first place.  We gripe about unemployment and/or the low pay for our low-end type jobs, but if we maintained no immigration, the wage/cost for any job would provide more of a fair value -AS COMPARED TO- the overall economy. What we are doing is skewing lower the economic value (pay) of low wage jobs <br>
as compared to the overall economy. The result&hellip; higher unemployment for native (White/Black/Whatever) Americans; the drive for ever more low-wage labor, and the increase in tax based support for those on welfare or unemployment. This will not work in the long run as we will eventually run out of humans to feed the pyramid. The only long term result we will see will be the destruction of White America&hellip; and for what?  So a few of the rich can become even richer? Or maybe so that some of us can make a living by having low-wage laborers do work that we could do, but would rather not?&hellip; It is the death of our nation to take such a path.</p>
<p>Also: &#8220;Mr. Perry echoed the opinion of the vast majority of non-retarded Texans when he signed that bill into law: If we can&rsquo;t shoot the illegals, then let&rsquo;s turn them into useful Americans and shut down the border so we don&rsquo;t have to educate any more of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Yes, but for how much longer do we have to hear this?!? We have heard over and over about how with just one more plan, we&rsquo;ll secure the border and all will be well.  It isn&rsquo;t happening. And for all the immigrants we turn into useful Americans, how many end up flying the Mexcan flag, denigrating America at every opportunity, and how many (not necessarily Mexican) will end up flying planes into buildings?  And please, I understand there are Whites who cause destruction, but that level of destruction I believe we can withstand -AND- remain as a nation state.  Bringing in the non-White world, along with its hatred of us and all we stand for, can only move us further down the path of losing our nation.</p>

I hear a very mixed up message and ideology coming from you, and I don&rsquo;t think you really have the right ideas to help a white America. In fact, you are definitely either a fifth columnist, or a traitor.<br>

Maybe you ought to start a MexRen.com!<br>
(I will almost certainly vote for Perry IF he is nominated, because Nothing is worse than Obama, Holder and company. But at this moment, I&rsquo;d rather have Romney, flawed as he is). <br>
The USA has been colonized by a massive, uneducated, crime and disease ridden, backward mass of Mestizos. Sounds like you&rsquo;re OK with that. Again, perhaps you should consider living south of the border?<br>
 God Bless Mexico, and Mexicans, in their own culture. Let them have it, and prosper, this is NOT Mexico.</p>

		<p>#38- Immigration is more properly a federal issue, given the ease with which people in the States can move between them and the nature of citizenship. Unfortunately many states now have a sizeable Mexican voting bloc, who resolutely vote against any measure that will promote American national interests above their own ethnic interest and the interest of an ineffably corrupt and backward foreign state.</p>
<p>You and your people will simply not have a Texas any more if you pursue these insane policies. Doubly so should other states exercise their rights with any degree of sense, guarding their borders and removing the &#8220;illegal magnets&#8221;. </p>
<p>Do you really think that a Texas populated and run by Mexican mestizos for the benefit of Mexican mestizos will be your Texas? Would such a state even be worth defending when the last White packs his bags and leaves the ruins?</p>
<p>It strikes me as absurd that you would demand your &#8220;state&rsquo;s right&#8221; not only to fail to guard the borders of the United States against what is in effect invasion, you would also extend your &#8220;state&rsquo;s right&#8221; to continue to set up a massive honey pot to which all these illegals would swarm, in time becoming voting citizens and stripping you of that sovereignty you are so careful to guard against your fellow Whites.</p>

		<p>I read an article on American Thinker a couple of months ago that pointed out that 60% of White Americans have a subnormal IQ. The average IQ for that segment of the White population has an average IQ of 92. The remaining 40% have an average IQ of 113.</p>
<p>It is clear to me which group the FENCERS come from.</p>
<p>48  &mdash;  Anonymous pointed out how well the fences work in Israel. Yeah, right. The longest fence they have is 25 miles long and it is backed up by infrared sensors, motion detectors, seismic sensors and line-of-sight armed guards who have orders to shoot to kill anybody who crosses the fence.</p>
<p>THAT WILL WORK! I&rsquo;m all for it. Woohoo! We should get started right away. The only thing stopping it is that it&rsquo;s politically impossible.</p>
<p>Another commenter, #50, also anonymous, believes that a 10 meter tall wall will do the job. Why didn&rsquo;t anybody else think of that? Oh, yeah, that&rsquo;s right, somebody else did.</p>
<p>They are presently building a wall down by Brownsville that is made of I-beams that are being driven deep into the ground. Boy, oh boy, I&rsquo;ll bet that will keep the clinically obese illegals out. Well, it would if those sneaky Mexicans would quit cutting off the I-beams at ground level and stealing them.</p>
<p>Do you actually think that all of solutions that come to mind first, like walls and fences, haven&rsquo;t already been tried along our southern border? Instead of building another wall or fence, why don&rsquo;t all of us taxpayers ride down the road throwing hundred dollar bills out the window. The results will be the same.</p>
<p>I thought Perry&rsquo;s plan was a good compromise. Let airplanes equipped with infrared detectors locate the illegals before they reach our border and have enough manpower along the border to get there in time to turn them back. I&rsquo;ve gotten enough speeding tickets on airplane patrolled highways to know how effective aerial surveillance can be.  </p>
<p>Perry sent the Rangers to the border to help with that, but they only have a couple of helicopters and not enough boots on the ground to make a difference. The republican-controlled  legislature refused to allocate funds for more manpower and they also refused to approve the use of rubber bullets to repel the invaders.</p>
<p>All of you 92%ers who are complaining about your state getting overran by illegals may want to build a wall around your state. See how well that works for you.</p>
<p>All of you 113%ers may want to get behind Perry. He already knows what doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>That sounds like a plan. Further, I suppose we can repatriate our Mestizo populous (save Puerto Ricans- they can go straight home) back to the next state they came from. Those states can do the same until they wind up in Texico. Oh, and why not send the blacks back south as well? They can sort them out down there. </p>
<p>But of course, you being so knowledgeable on the Constitution, do know that states cannot do such a thing as build a wall on their border with another state. </p>
<p>We know what works too, and that is force. </p>
<p>You are right to point out that the Israeli walls are not mere fences. Neither was the Great Wall of China (which also worked-until a traitor opened the gates to nomad invaders) So I propose a single large wall that can be manned along with two smaller barriers of razor wire and landmines. </p>

		<p>63-Anon: &#8220;Oh come on, no one respects a dish washer.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I do.  It&rsquo;s hard, dirty work.  Anyone who does it, and does it well, deserves respect in my book.</p>
<p><br>
And: &#8220;Hispanics who come here and work these menial jobs grow to hate the whites they see living better, especially their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Correct. Yet we continue to import those who grow to hate us, and our children, more and more each passing day.</p>
<p><br>
And: &#8220;On the other hand, I was happy to wash dishes when I was in school. It was a good job for a student and I had fun doing it,&#8221;</p>
<p>- I washed dishes in school as well, and did not enjoy it at all.  It did instill a great sense of motivation within me though, to learn another profession.  I have not had to wash dishes since, but I still respect those who do.</p>
<p>And: &#8220;Manual labor is good, healthy work and training for the young.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I agree with this statement.</p>
<p><br>
And: &#8220;It is demeaning and represents a dead end for an adult.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Not so much in agreement with this statement.</p>
<p><br>
And: &#8220;Think about it. Herein lies some of the keys to our national problem in many ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Agree.  I&rsquo;m not sure of what solutions you may have or believe in, but for the record, non of my solutions involve the importation of any non-White personnel.<br>

		<p>#38 What in the heck are you talking about.  I live in Texas and Perry is a joke, I never voted for him and never will.  Take a look at his record.  The TTC, thats right, take land away from Texans and give it to Mexico.  What about the shot for girls, who in their right minds would take something that was not tested very long.  The fire in the capital, I will not use tax money to fix the capital, what does he do use&rsquo;s tax money, once again says something and does something different. Have you lost a job to a Mexican I bet you have not, well my husband did and I will tell you were.  When the Toyota plant was being built, they had to hire whites, and fired all of them with in 2 months, for what ever reason they could find.  The union was run by a Mexican so you did not have a leg to stand on.  College brakes for Mexicans yea right how many other students that scored better, were better students lost a spot because of them.  You need to step away from your computer and get into the real world, maybe learn something.  If you want to live in a state that has hospitals close schools close people using thier front yards as bathrooms you go to Mexico, you see I for one will not miss the likes of you.  LONG LIVE THE USA</p>
