<h1><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-living/ci_18847167?source=most_viewed">Stanford Law Professor Argues Black Women Should Cross Race Barrier for Marriage Partners</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa M. Krieger, Mercury News, September 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A provocative new book by Stanford law professor Ralph Richard Banks examines why black women are so unlikely to marry  &mdash;  and proposes a solution that is arousing controversy in the African-American community: Cross the color line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&rsquo;t marry down. Marry out,&#8221; says Banks in his campus office, busy with phone calls, emails and preparation for the new semester. The shared experience that once bound blacks together  &mdash;  segregation  &mdash;  is gone, he asserts. &#8220;So it all coalesces around this  &hellip; : whether black women will continue to be held hostage to the failings of black men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Particularly in California, where only 6.2 percent of the population is black, &#8220;conditions are very conducive to interracial relationships,&#8221; he says. &#8220;African-Americans are a very small group here. And everyone&rsquo;s moved away from home, so they&rsquo;re more likely to form nontraditional bonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some welcome his book, &#8220;Is Marriage for White People?&#8221; because it has started an uncomfortable conversation they say is long overdue.</p>
<p>But others contend that he denigrates men and dispirits women, calling him a profiteer, a &#8220;racial pimp&#8221; and other names he says &#8220;that I can&rsquo;t repeat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He speaks from a position that seems rarer every day: a black male who is highly educated (bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees from Stanford, &#8216;87, and one from Harvard Law, cum laude, &#8216;94), professional (14 years at Stanford Law School), married to a black woman (Stanford social psychology professor Jennifer Eberhardt, whom he calls &#8220;the most brilliant and beautiful woman I have ever met&#8221;).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But most black women face a big problem, he asserts. High rates of incarceration and job-market discrimination against black men have created a gender imbalance. Then women confront the venerable economic model of supply and demand  &mdash;  scarcity creates excess demand for black grooms, tilting the terms of courtship to men&rsquo;s favor. Many simply sidestep commitment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He speaks from personal experience; two of Banks&rsquo; three sisters  &mdash;  &#8220;intelligent, beautiful and educated&#8221;  &mdash;  are unmarried. In fact, black women are the most unmarried group of people in our nation. They&rsquo;re only half as likely as white women to be married, and more than three times as likely as white women never to marry, according to his analyses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t always so. Through the middle of the 20th century, about nine out of 10 black women married. Now black women are about half as likely to be married as their 1950s counterparts. White adults are also more likely to be single today than in the past. But marriage has diminished more among African-Americans than among any other Americans.</p>
<p>And when they do marry, black women are more likely to marry men with substantially less education or less income, Banks says.</p>
<p>His message to black women: Stop settling for less than you deserve. Forget race loyalty. Quit thinking that white, Asian and Latino men don&rsquo;t find you attractive; it&rsquo;s not true. {snip}</p>
<p>He writes with a tone of encouragement, not blame or finger-pointing. Think Oprah, not Dr. Laura.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Oakland-based L. Jeanine Phillips, 28, who has a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in biology, a passion for reading and a rewarding career as an operations manager for an upscale firm, says Banks&rsquo; analysis rings true.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have dated and even married a black man in the past,&#8221; says Phillips, vice president of the Bay Area chapter of the Sistas Book Club. &#8220;After endless bad relationships  &mdash;  all seeming to stem from black men&rsquo;s egos and inability to keep their penis in their pants, also coming from broken homes  &mdash;  I have decided to go on hiatus from black men and only date out of my race.</p>
<p>&#8220;And thus far it has been a success. I am currently dating a great white man&#8221; with a degree from UC-Davis, she says, &#8220;who seems to appreciate me, respect me, and we match equally educationally and culturally. We have the same religious beliefs. And it&rsquo;s a major bonus that we share the same family values.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; solution was also challenged by African-American scholars in a &#8220;virtual symposium&#8221; held by the nonprofit and nonpartisan Council on Contemporary Families.</p>
<p>There, Professor Micere Keels of the University of Chicago argued that black women don&rsquo;t rule out nonblack partners. Rather, studies show they receive fewer advances from whites, Latinos or Asians.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only viable solution for black women&rsquo;s low likelihood of marriage is to correct society&rsquo;s failure to educate all our boys,&#8221; she concluded.</p>
<p>Similarly, Kansas University professor Shirley Hill said in the same symposium that &#8220;dealing with structural issues&#8221;  &mdash;  such as high unemployment and incarceration of black men  &mdash;  &#8220;gets us closer to the root of the problem.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;studies show they (black women) receive fewer advances from whites, Latinos or Asians&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even for men of other races attracted to black women, I see why they don&rsquo;t make an effort. Marriage to an unknown quality is a scary proposition. I think these studies have it backwards however. After decades of &#8216;newsreports&rsquo; and enlightened &#8216;education&rsquo; most black women don&rsquo;t consider white men to be equal persons. They are privileged and oppressors, and all possibly racist, the lowest you can go, if they are all not racist it being a matter of degree. Even for those attracted to white men or wanting to pursue white men, for whatever reason, somewhere deep inside there is a belief white men are kind of non-persons. <br>

		<p>Please don&rsquo;t polute my gene pool with your peoples inferior genetics.  Keep one thing in mind, Mr. Banks, it is black woman who create black men.  They give birth to them and raise them into the wastes of time they turn out to be.  Maybe if black women were a bit more discerning and stopped getting pregnant by any hoodlum who happens along perhaps the black gene pool would inmprove.  Just don&rsquo;t polute my people, thank you very much!</p>

		<p>The whole reason this chaos- black men in prison, black women unable to find spouses- is happening, is the forceful integration of Blacks into a society that they would never have created.</p>
<p>This problem would not exist for Blacks in a Black African country. And there would be no pressure on Whites to, once again, help out Blacks by sacrificing our own genetics, among other things.</p>
<p>In a saner age this professor&rsquo;s idea would be laughed at, but everyone is supposed to be clueless about race, so we will continue with this dog-and-pony show until Whites get the big picture.</p>

		<p>How many black women are actually considered attractive by white men?  Maybe something like 1 out of 100.  The hot black women you see on TV are not representative.  Out in the work-a-day world I hardly ever see an attractive black woman.  And the ones I do see know they are the rare hot ones and act like it, complete with holier-than-thou attitude and won&rsquo;t give you the time of day.  They deserve to be alone.  I could care less.  </p>

		<p>Black women do indeed face obstacles in trying to find a mate: Morbid obesity, bad temper and attitude, low impulse control, preoccupation with superficialities like &#8220;bling,&#8221; low cognitive function, and high testosterone levels among the problems that make them unattractive. Not all; just most.</p>

<p>This character is burdened with the delusion that there are few black women marrying someone of another race out of choice.</p>

		<p>Apparently the Professor either didn&rsquo;t read or missed that blog &ldquo;Why Are Black Women Ugly?&rdquo; by the evolutionary psychologist Satoshi Kanazawa from the London School of Economics that was briefly posted on Psychology Today.  The average educated White man&rsquo;s preference (even non-educated) is White first, Asian second, Latino (preferably with a high Spanish percentage) and Black last in that order.   That&rsquo;s a lot of choice to have before going Black.   Plus I don&rsquo;t see Asian men or Latino men flocking to make the African choice.</p>

		<p>Dating isn&rsquo;t the same things as a marriage with children. They use an example of a black woman dating a man, but is she married to him yet?<br>
   I don&rsquo;t think there is a going to be a rush of decent white men getting hitched to black in California. The white men who are lower class and willing to jump the race barrier go for mexican women. Not that I approve of that but it&rsquo;s far more likely. I knew a hugely fat white male architect who dated a tall black african model, but he married a white woman of welsh and irish decent with red hair. The black woman was his trophy date not his future wife.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, being unmarried does not preclude black women from having children. Nevertheless, I think &#8220;marry out&#8221; is a concept that does have some merit. Black women should &#8220;marry out&#8221; by leaving the USA for Africa, and marry there.</p>

		<p>Almost all black women would jump at the chance to marry white men.  To begin with, nearly every woman on earth wants to be married, and black women are no different.  A white man would be a prize for a black woman, just as white woman are seen as prizes to black men.  A white man would more likely be a better provider and a better father.  <br>
It&rsquo;s nothing but liberal claptrap to insist that black women want only black men, and the liberals spouting such nonsense know it.  But some PC excuse must be found for the fact that the vast majority of white men marry non-black women.  <br>
I&rsquo;ve often wondered if most American blacks were happier before integration.  Since it occurred, the black family has been breaking down, and black drug use and gun crimes have soared.  Competition with whites is a no-win situation for most blacks.  It simply points out their inadequacies and drives them to frustration and self-hatred.  </p>

<p>My message to black women:   No sane or healthy white man wants ANYTHING to do with women of your race.  The mere thought of engaging in any sort of &#8216;intimate&rsquo; act with a black woman is more than enough to make any sane, healthy, and self-respecting white man&rsquo;s flesh to crawl in horrific revulsion.</p>
<p>A reminder to my fellow white racial brothers and sisters.  White genes are regressive genes.   This means that when whites race mix with non-whites, white regressive genes are easily overpowered, overwhelmed, and destroyed by the genes of the non-white they breed with.  This is why 99% of the off-spring of black-white miscegenators emerges from the womb with overwhelmingly dominant black features - kinky hair, broad noses, dark skin, etc.   This equates to white racial genocide, and anyone who promotes race mixing is promoting GENOCIDE.</p>
<p>And, black genes are the most effective in destroying White European genes.   Don&rsquo;t believe me?   Do some research on how race mixing between White Portuguese people and their black slaves destroyed the nation of Portugal - who was once considered a top notch world power.  </p>

		<p>The liberals simply won&rsquo;t accept the fact that most people prefer the company of people like themselves, especially in a close relationship like a marriage. Although some people are happier if they&rsquo;re married, one can lead a good life as a single person. Being single isn&rsquo;t so bad that you have to engage in miscegenation to escape it. </p>

		<p>Marriage is deeply personal and private.<br>
A person need not give any justification for his or her choice<br>
of partner and the profeesor is getting close to being offensive and oppressive.<br>
  Anyway he&rsquo;s talking a lot of nonsense.Compatibility and character (aside from any initial physical attraction), are the key determinants of a successful marriage.Men marry women of lower socio-economic status all the time, it&rsquo;s only a minor issue.If gender equality meant anything, women would do the same.<br>
  Besides the occupation of an individual is really, in the scheme of things, a minor matter - a question of luck and judgement.&rsquo;Race&rsquo; by which we mean genetics is of a far, far higher importance - basically it comes down from the dark prehistoric past and carries on to the unknown future.<br>

		<p>i have actually seen an increasing number of young white men with black women (usually horrible looking) they always seem ultra liberal, and i suspect, like adapting african kids its a new form of narcissism - look how pure and noble i am, i am marrying a black person&hellip;</p>
<p>with both the white couples who adapt black kids and whites who intermarry blacks - particularly young white men - they always seem to have this proud gleam on their face, scanning the room, looking for approval. </p>

		<p>A message for Luke and others that believe the claptrap of White &#8220;genes&#8221; being resessive ( not regressive ). Consider any mulatto you have ever seen. The product of a union of a black man and a white woman is always lighter in pigmentation. Look at the current president. His father was a black African and Jimmy Obama is much lighter in skin tone than his father. If a black and white had offspring that bred with a majority white partner, and their offspring did the same, &#8220;blackness&#8221; would be bred out of the population in 6 generations or so. American blacks are generally lighter than African blacks and the DOMINANT white features of lighter skin tone, european shaped noses, hair color other than black, and thinner lips appeared with only limited race mixing in the past. In other words, if Jimmy Obama had married a white woman, his 2 daughters would be lighter than he is, and if they married and had children with white men, their children would look more like their great-grandmother, not their great-grandfather. I also agree with another poster about the attractiveness of black women. I have never considered a black woman attractive, and if you are honest you would admit that so called attractive black women, even to other blacks, have white features. Think Beyonce Knowles.</p>

&#8220;And, black genes are the most effective in destroying White European genes. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Do some research on how race mixing between White Portuguese people and their black slaves destroyed the nation of Portugal - who was once considered a top notch world power.&#8221;</p>
<p>An excellent example, but I might add that it isn&rsquo;t just Portugal that was affected due to the same watering down process.  The Indo-European whites in Egypt were eventually outbred by their many blacks slaves and Arabs by about 800 B.C. </p>
<p>Greece was affected to some extent also by an influx of non-whites, but still retained a significant white population.  Spain, Italy, both to a  small degree were affected, while the entire area of North Africa was also.  Iran, Afghanistan, also.</p>
<p>The same process is taking place in the US.  If there is no civil war to separate the races into their own enclaves, eventually the utopian dream of a &#8220;tan man&#8221; will be realized here.</p>
<p>And, 1000 years from now will the blacks point to Obama and Colin Powell, et al, and declare blacks created and built the USA, just as they do now claiming that the Nubians who flooded into a multicultural Egypt and took over really were the ones who built the pyramids and built the ancient nation of Egypt?</p>

		<p>Some whites date blacks for sexual reasons but that has long been categorized by pornographers as a &#8220;fetish.&#8221;  Yes, it&rsquo;s not just the fashion industry which excludes blacks.  Infamous pornstars are almost all white, reflecting public desire.  Obviously black sex does not sell because blacks are unattractive.  Are we supposed to believe that there is something black women can do to make themselves more sexually attractive?  And it&rsquo;s not merely a weight problem as slender foreign black women fail to appear in porn as well.<br>

		<p>There is in all this a topic languishing somewhere between<br>
social psychology and psychometrics and that would be relevant within racially homogenous societies.  That topic is how individual &#8220;g&#8221; is enhanced or diminished by the &#8220;g&#8221; levels of<br>
members of one&rsquo;s immediate social group, etc.  While there is<br>
about a 50% correlation in &#8220;g&#8221; between marriage partners, this<br>
leaves room for variance.  If, say, a  female with a &#8220;g&#8221;<br>
level within a zone surrounding an IQ of, say, 85, marries ( a male)  with an IQ of, say, 100  &mdash;  in a reasonably harmonious relationship, then a lot of her perceptions and choices are going to be enhanced somewhat beyond a mere &#8220;85 level&#8221;.  It is<br>
not a matter of &#8220;nurtue&#8221; but of &#8220;social prosthesis&#8221;.  </p>

<p>If you did the math, you&rsquo;d find that if the necessary White genes were sacrificed for your noble cause, there would be no pure Whites left by the sixth generation, actually far sooner than that. Repatriation is a far better solution.</p>

		<p>It appears unanimous that Black American women have often got an awful temper. But Sahel women (Mali, Senegal) are remarkably quiet. They are so peaceful that they appear sometimes nonchalant. Ivorian women are much louder. Antillean women (Guadeloupe, Martinique) have acceptable mood and they have a strong reputation to seek White husbands.</p>
<p>The biggest part of the African-American woman&rsquo;s behaviour is certainly driven by culture rather than race. Generally, blacks are more expressive than other races, but there are wide differences. Certainly, there are even regional differences among Blacks in the USA, as it is probably the case with Whites.</p>

		<p>I dunno. Maybe something could be said for encouraging young white men to knock up young black women in hopes of improving their race. The black women are going to get knocked up anyway. Might as well increase the white genetic material, especially since whites are not reproducing fast enough to keep up.</p>

Actually, most prostitutes are not obese. In fact, many of them have pimps who keep them on a certain weight restriction. Even those that work independently are mostly thin. How many men are going to pay for sex with a obese woman? </p>
