			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Charles Lewis, National Post, September 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tory MP plans to introduce legislation as early as Friday calling for the repeal of a section in the federal human rights code banning hate speech over the Internet.</p>
<p>Despite being a backbencher, Brian Storseth is convinced the bill will succeed because nearly every Tory MP opposes Section 13, and he believes the Harper government wants to see it repealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Section 13 suppresses the basic right to freedom of speech in our society that is guaranteed under the Charter of Rights &amp; Freedoms,&#8221; said Mr. Storseth, who represents the Alberta riding of Westlock-St. Paul.</p>
<p>Hate speech that is truly capable of bringing harm to an identifiable group or individual is already dealt with in the Criminal Code, he said. In those cases, police investigate and the Attorney General has to lay the complaint to ensure that allegation is not frivolous.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have some reasonable tests of harm in our society and I believe the Criminal Code looks after that and ensures that Canadians aren&rsquo;t targeted by hatred,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the difference is that in a court there is the openness and transparency, which you don&rsquo;t have through the human rights tribunal. In a tribunal, a person can lay a complaint, but doesn&rsquo;t not have to have their name attached to it. There&rsquo;s no cost or expense to the person putting the complaint forward, no matter how frivolous that complaint might be. And it violates the fundamental right of an accused to face his accuser.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, all the onus and costs are put on the defendant and this should not the basis of our justice system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suppressing free speech can help drive abhorrent views underground, allowing them to fester and grow, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to have liberty of free speech and it&rsquo;s ultimately freedom of speech that looks after these issues by allowing the light of day to destroy hateful propaganda.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill will come to a first vote in early November, about a month before the constitutionality of Section 13 will be reviewed by a federal court.</p>
<p>Mr. Storseth said he prefers not to wait for the court to make its decision because this is the responsibility of Parliament.</p>
<p>Section 13 has been controversial since its inception more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>In 2008, Richard Moon, a law professor at the University of Windsor, prepared a report for the Canadian Human Rights Commission concluding the section should be removed. His advice was never acted upon.</p>
<p>The following year, a member of a human rights tribunal said Section 13 violated the Charter, which put the bill in a state of limbo and eventually led to the review in federal court.</p>
<p>Nathalie Des Rosiers, general counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, said the section &#8220;limits free speech and it is far from a reasonable limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said the wording of the section is so broad it makes the determination of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; too arbitrary and too subjective.</p>
<p>In 2008, Keith Martin, then a Liberal MP, tried to remove Section 13 from the human rights code. He was in part reacting to a case in which author Mark Steyn and Maclean&rsquo;s magazine were brought before a tribunal for allegedly promoting Islamaphobia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have hate crime legislation thankfully in our country,&#8221; Mr. Martin said at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;If something is deemed to be a hate crime it should go to court. Anything else that is not deemed to be a hate crime [under the Criminal Code] people should be allowed to say whether you agree or vehemently oppose it. Thankfully, we live in a country where we&rsquo;re allowed to speak our mind.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they repeal it or not. The &#8220;anti-hate&#8221; multiculturalists will come back with something stronger and worse.  They won&rsquo;t give up.  They are marching for total victory, and small setbacks like this one will only  give them greater dedication and more money from Soros.  </p>
<p>What is the White Future in America.  Very dark.  We have a 5-4 on the SCOTUS right now, and will probably get a temporary reprieve from the blackObama&rsquo;s illegal health care mandate. But what about when the illegals start voting in numbers too many to catch, and they give the Dems that permanent majority.  They will get their own permanent 5-4, then 6-3, then 7-2, then 8-1, then 9-0.  The Tea Party will be outlawed as a terrorist hate group.  White babies will be given to &#8220;more inclusive and welcoming families that represent a commitment to Diversity and Multiculturalism&#8221;.  &#8220;Too White&#8221; communities will be a thing of the &#8220;shameful past&#8221;.</p>
<p>But for now, all you can do is transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next, you see it in your worst nightmares, and you are extremely right!<br>

		<p>All of these various draconian &#8220;speech-laws&#8221; &#8220;hate laws&#8221; and the like throughout Europe point to only one glaring fact - those who fear free speech fear truth, and almost certainly have something to hide&hellip;it&rsquo;s just that simple! According to most of these ludicrous laws, virtually ANYTHING can be deemed as criminal &#8220;incitement&#8221; along racial lines, etc. The fact that various &#8220;thought-criminals&#8221; across Europe can be, have been and are imprisoned for, well&hellip;thoughts freely expressed, is a stain upon all the Western world - those who instigate and support such legal terrorism are the true enemies of freedom and liberty! </p>

		<p>Folks, remember this . The Liberal&rsquo;s days of ascendancy are already over. Yes, there is more sqwaking to be heard, more petty and maybe large offenses to be endured and undone by whites, but the final act is in play.</p>
<p>We need to take THIS stance, this belief, and move forward, even if rugged individuality and Nietzsche- like belief in our SELVES is all we can cling to. In fact, That is likely to be a stronger bulwark than any ideology, as ideologies either are, or will become decadent. All that groups build, comes to failure. The individual white WILL endure.<br>

		<p>Rules of Survival as the White Minority in USAfroMexArabia:</p>
<p>Starting right now, withhold all donations of any kind to civic and charitable institutions.  Anything you give now will be given away to the non white coalition of hate, or will be stolen and destroyed by them when they have enough &#8220;critical mass&#8221; to take over everything.  Keep all your treasure for your own family, kith and kin. </p>
<p>Stockpile, stockpile, stockpile- bitterly cling to your guns and religion.</p>
<p>Learn how to keep a very low profile.  Speaking out will get you jailed, raped, and killed.</p>
<p>Avoid eye contact with non whites. If you look at them, unless it&rsquo;s looking up at them after having kissed their foot while you beg for forgiveness for profiting from slavery and segregation, you will be signaling to them that you are apprehensive of their differences, and that your White eye are full of hatred and greed to keep your White privilege.</p>
<p>Start a paper trail of &#8220;embracing diversity and inclusion&#8221; and &#8220;celebrating diversity and welcoming differences&#8221;.  Become known as &#8220;someone who cares&#8221;, but don&rsquo;t actually do anything.  Just go to the seminar, get your picture taken with the grinning blacks, and quietly slip out the back door as soon as possible.  Do some mission work with your afro-worshipping church so that you can have something to say  in your own defense when the time comes.  Be prepared for racists to yell &#8220;so why don&rsquo;t you take them home with you?&#8221; when you are building a house for another black mother and her eleven children.  Start thinking of why you wouldn&rsquo;t want eleven black children running around your house, and be able to say so without sounding like a racist.  Good luck with that one.</p>

<p>Yeah and I bet you are talking about us &#8220;hateful&#8221; White racists with that statement. Right? The real hateful propaganda comes from the marxists and assorted nonwhites. Anything we WN&rsquo;s say is already labeled as hate speech and propaganda so what is new here?</p>

		<p>agree completely with number 4. I learned the hard way and was  thrown in jail for telling a property manager not to rent to illegal mexicans -whom he referred to as the Nice Spanish People.</p>
<p> Of course, he never rented to any more Nice Spanish People, especially since the Nice White People upstairs were stomping on the floor to get them to leave&hellip; but never reveal your hand if you are white. I simply was really naive.</p>

		<p>There should be a lot more involved than changing a law. For one, there have been many social changes over the years while Canadians were threatened to keep our mouths shut. Social discourse has been rotten to the core. If Canadians had had freedom of speech these changes might never have happened. The government should feel a moral responsibility to re-evaluate these social changes. How about simulation exercises to show what a free debate might have sounded like? That would also be a good way of showing us what we can legally say now. I&rsquo;m thinking of a CBC TV series with weekly episodes devoted to topics that can now be spoken of legally. </p>
<p>Different countries have different restrictions on speech. People following foreign news might say things that are legal somewhere else but not in Canada. Or Canadians might now be able to say things legally that will cause trouble in other countries. Government will need to prepare guidance so we don&rsquo;t cause trouble for ourselves or others. Guidance can be given to show how borderline illegal speech can be changed to make it legal. </p>

As for venting your frustrations, I can understand. But if you TRULY mean all you said, than you are wallowing in a pool of defeatism. ( I agree not making eye contact with Browns is a good thing; but only to let them know they are unwelcome Let them know you see them unfit for recognition. Be proud and unassuming. They simply do not exist).</p>
<p>Other than that, you are floundering in useless anger. You have to channel that into something that&rsquo;s going to save your life, and not leave you helplessly bitter, while encouraging the whites around you to fall into a funk also.<br>
This site is good for raising awareness, but LOUSY for helping us to feel hopeless!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, for your own good, but also for the good of the rest of us, that you have to stop the total defeatism.<br>
Can&rsquo;t you see that Marxism and brown energies are dying out? With the economic collapse, and the sheer fatigue of whites under forty years of the system, it is time for a &#8220;regime change.&#8221; It is a natural cycle. <br>
Add to that, whites are through with being pinched. The public schools are collapsing! Hooray! There is no more money to prop the massive brown junior- prisons up&hellip;whites are DONE funding them. <br>
Here in Colorado, there&rsquo;s a democrat-initiated statewide election on  November 1st, to raise state income tax and the state sales tax&hellip;to fund education. Even in the very recently liberalized Colorado, this proposed law has almost no real friends. <br>
Even hardcore liberals are saying &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think we should give more money to the education system. They have all they need already.&#8221;<br>
Just think about that. They aren&rsquo;t fully ready to ADMIT why, but they darn well KNOW why they feel this way. They know you can&rsquo;t fix stupid. I have even heard some libtards say so. This is a SHOCKING turnaround, some liberls are willing to speak the&hellip;TRUTH. This means their world is crumbling.</p>
<p>I am telling you this is a golden opportunity for race realists; <br>
Stop moaning, and vote Obama out. Look at your mindset, which is plagued with justifiable disgust and bitterness. Figure out, on your own terms, how to rise above the ineffectual bitterness; plot a course for yourself, where you get OUT of the brown environments in a few years (whatever the cost). Find a way to be much more free of the social network (assuming it&rsquo;s so liberal). Speak fact and truth deliberately about race once in a while. Put liberals in the spot where they have to question THEIR values. It&rsquo;s easier than you think. <br>
The tables ARE turning. Don&rsquo;t be so blinded by anger that you miss the chance to capitalize on it. We need all hands on deck!</p>

<p><br>
Speak out, speak loudly, and speak proudly. Yeah, you might have to watch the ones that cross a few laws, but when a non-white gets on a high horse, or a white chained to a false mythology tries to speak their propaganda, stand up and say: &#8220;If collective guilt for something generations removed is the standard, should there not be a higher standard for things done in the present? Thus should not blacks, indians, and mexicans be paying me reparations in the present for the many crimes they have committed in my own lifetime, and their huge welfare dependence upon the backs of the White man?&#8221; It takes a few times saying it for it to come naturally, but its very liberating to watch the shocked faces when someone speaks the truth. The best reply they will come up with is &#8220;That is racist!&#8221; To which you respond &#8220;Of course it is, and so is &hellip;&#8221; Turn it around on them. </p>
<p>You might only raise the consciousness of 5% who hear it, but its 5% more than yesterday, and that is 5% more tomorrow. Their game only works if we are cowed. Its like the American&rsquo;s in the handling of Somalia. The average soldier on the ground was ticked because we didn&rsquo;t go back, finish the job, and level the place to get Aidid. However, when the American&rsquo;s went in with special forces, and shot the pirates the piracy decreased substantially. Its bad mythology that is keeping us feeling defeated, and it is high time that we abandoned the bad mythology of being polite about it. </p>
