<h1>The Brown Dog </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joseph Kay, American Renaissance, September 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When I was travelling in rural Mexico I noticed that every gas station/general store had a collection of feral, medium-sized short-haired, floppy-eared brown dogs lolling about. They seemed to be everywhere. A friend who grew up in Panama said that they were so common there that they were called &#8220;dog of Panama.&#8221; I would guess that these creatures result from dogs freely breeding without human intervention  &mdash;  the &#8220;default dog,&#8221; so to speak. </p>
<p>It soon occurred to me that these &#8220;default dogs&#8221; had a human equivalent  &mdash;  towns, cities or neighborhoods populated by people of common ancestry, probably of similar IQ, pretty much free to live unhampered by outside intervention. Put another way, fill a city with blacks, Hispanics, Irish, Germans, Greeks, or whatever, and with minimal outside interference you&rsquo;ll eventually see the human version of the medium-sized short-haired brown dog.  The &#8220;brown dog&#8221; signifies the emergent distinctive group-related pattern, not universal human traits. The utility of &#8220;the brown dog&#8221; concept is that it encapsulates and predicts a distinct cultural evolution: assemble enough people sharing a common ancestry, leave them alone for a few decades, and &#8220;their&#8221; brown dog will appear. </p>
<p>A town populated with Germans free to express their cultural proclivities will eventually become a &#8220;German brown dog:&#8221; clean, well maintained houses with plenty of flowers, a multitude of civic organizations, swept sidewalks, food markets heavy on pork, cafes with great pastries, a well-groomed park complete with a bandstand, a zoo, a brewery, and museums. In fact, the rural version of the German brown dog can still be seen in upper Mid-Western American farm communities: straight upright fences, expensive blue Harvestore silos, freshly painted houses, and neatly parked, modern farm equipment (I checked mailboxes to ascertain ethnicity). </p>
<p>Two brown dogs of particular interest in today&rsquo;s political climate are the black and Mexican versions. They are ubiquitous because non-blacks and non-Mexicans avoid living in those areas, and because the government is reluctant to enforce outside social norms. The phrase &#8220;autonomous homelands&#8221; comes to mind.</p>
<p>The McDonalds-like uniformity is striking. A visitor who was parachuted into Newark, Camden, Detroit, East St. Louis, Gary Indiana, New Orleans, or any number of other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._cities_with_large_African_American_populations">black urban neighborhoods</a> would be hard pressed to identify exactly where he was, but he would not have to look at a single face to know he was in a lower-class black neighborhood. It is important to note that everything about these neighborhoods happens spontaneously. There is no central plan, nor do residents consciously try to emulate other black localities. No government agency says, &#8220;Let&rsquo;s make this place comfortable for underclass blacks by recreating other poor black neighborhoods.&#8221; And yet, all these places share distinctive visible traits that proclaim: &#8220;You are among poor blacks.&#8221; </p>
<p>The tip-offs are litter and graffiti everywhere, vacant stores, small markets typically run by Arabs or Koreans with iron bars on the windows, abandoned buildings with broken windows, trash-filled empty lots, the absence of national chain stores, vandalized parks and schools, run-down housing, tricked-out old cars, and the like. Not visible but equally part of the neighborhood are high food stamp usage, single-parent families, corrupt politics, high unemployment, widespread drug use, and violent crime. This is not just any slum; it is a black slum. </p>
<p>Even more remarkable is that these lower class black &#8220;brown dog&#8221; conditions thrive outside the US. When I visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia">St. Lucia</a> in the Caribbean I felt as if I were in New York City&rsquo;s Bed-Sty or Chicago&rsquo;s South Side. There are also similarities from what I see on television between West Africa and black-dominated cities like Detroit and Newark  &mdash;  even a similar penchant for kleptocratic political leaders reluctant to surrender power. </p>
<p>The brown dog is not the time-honored pattern of immigrants consciously recreating their old-world village habitats prior to assimilation. If that were the case, all old-world traits in the US would uniformly weaken over time. In the case of lower-class blacks and poor Hispanics, this drift toward the brown dog has only accelerated as these groups come to dominate their local environments. Two hundred years after the last black slave arrived from Africa, 150 years after emancipation, and despite billions in governments spending to promote racial integration, lower-class black-controlled US neighborhoods are becoming more like West African cities.</p>
<p>This gravitation toward some cultural end point is unrelated to poverty, though specific brown dogs do reflect social class. Middle-class blacks have a different brown dog from that of poor blacks. Side-by-side comparisons of semi-autonomous Irish, Jewish, Chinese, Indian, Korean, German, and Mexican neighborhoods with equally low incomes would still show substantial differences  &mdash;  there is no such thing as a universal slum. </p>
<p>New York City&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan">Chinatown</a> is among the city&rsquo;s poorest, most congested neighborhoods, but it overflows with thriving small businesses (many on sidewalks), crowded cheap restaurants, and high-performing though often ancient schools with graduates going on to prestigious colleges. It is also completely safe for visitors even late at night. My recollection of San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown is identical, and I suspect that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinatowns">Chinatowns worldwide</a> are similar. Nobody walking through Brooklyn&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Beach">Brighton Beach</a>, which is packed with often poor Russian immigrants would ever confuse it for lower-class black-dominated Trenton, even though much of the housing stock is as old as the housing in black slums. </p>
<p>The source of this uniformity may well be genetic, though I cannot find any scientific evidence for an assertion that culture is genetic. But how else can one explain close similarities between peoples who have been separated for centuries? Why, for example, does Haiti resemble West Africa, economically and culturally, but not its more prosperous, better administrated island neighbor, the Dominican Republic? Why is it that the lively services in black churches are so similar to Haitian and African church services? It is hard to argue that distinctive cultures in multiple settings can linger almost unchanged for centuries, without an underlying biological substrate.</p>
<p>To repeat, the virtue of the brown dog concept is that it symbolizes a plain-to-see phenomenon that currently lacks a name: the relentless drift to a &#8220;default&#8221; ethnic/racial condition when a people are left to their own devices. More important than linguistic convenience, however, is eliminating the guess work when anticipating the future. At least with some but not all groups, the past is also the future, sometimes even more so, and this seems to happen regardless of billion-dollar government programs. Finally, the brown dog phenomenon has powerful implications for those who insist that the American melting pot can assimilate everyone, as in some old-fashioned Hollywood movie, in which we all live happily ever after in some homogenized white-bread Utopia. </p>
<p>Determining a group&rsquo;s brown dog is an empirical question that requires careful inquiry. Eastern Europe Jews who arrived over a century ago have not re-created shtetl-like Jewish neighborhoods. The run-down rural shtetl of Eastern Europe, though often romanticized, was not their brown dog. Life there, including choice of occupation, was tightly regulated by anti-Semitic governments. Given the opportunity to escape these constraints and enjoy economic and educational freedom, they created prosperous neighborhoods in dozens of American cities and throughout Europe and Israel. Perhaps more to the point, thanks to different brown dogs, the <a href="https://www.americanthinker.com/2009/04/somali_immigrants_remake_minne.html">Somalis of Minneapolis</a> may never resemble their Swedish neighbors. </p>
<p>Before Third-World immigration, the United States was on its way towards an American brown dog  &mdash;  one with regional and class variants, to be sure  &mdash;  but one that was distinctively American. Now, we are headed towards a whole pack of brown dogs that would be more at home in other countries.</p>

		<p>Brown really is the default of domestic dogs left to their own devices for several generations. Countries with long term stray populations show that a mid sized brown/gray dog is the default color when all the various breeds mix time and time again.</p>

		<p>You take 100 Greeks, a 100 Finns, a 100 Japanese, a 100 Chinese, a 100 Nigerians and 100 Angolans, put all six groups on their own identical islands, (same size, resources, climate, etc) make sure all their kids learn English (to midigate for cultural differences) and then come back in 50 years. The islands populated by Greeks and Finns will probably be most similar to each other and likewise the two populated with Nigerians and Angolans and with Japanese and Chinese will be as well. Overall, the &#8216;Asian&#8221; islands will be much more similar to the &#8220;white&#8221; islands then the &#8220;black&#8221; ones in terms of development, living standards and even the dialects of English spoken by the inhabitants. The point is, genetic differences between races affect the kinds of civilizations they can produce. Africa is Africa because it&rsquo;s full of Africans. Detroit is Detroit because it&rsquo;s full of Africans. Vermont is Vermont because it&rsquo;s full of whites. </p>

		<p>I assume that the &#8220;Third-World immigration&#8221; of the concluding paragraph includes the transport of African slaves to America.  Otherwise, the thesis of the article  &mdash;  that blacks worldwide are inherently different from whites and Asians  &mdash;  would not hold up.  <br>
American ghettoes contain the most African of the nation&rsquo;s blacks.  Those with greater proportions of white ancestry are generally smarter and able to move beyond the ghetto.  And, since the sexual revolution, fewer white men need to seek out promiscuous black women in black neighborhoods, so that infusions of white blood are greatly curtailed.  Also, the danger of predatory crime in such areas keeps whites away.   Thus, ghettoes are becoming concentrations of Africanism in a way they never have before.  </p>

		<p>I was recently in Montego Bay, Jamaica. I was fascinated by the similarities between their culture and value system and that of black Americans. It was the most squalid place I&rsquo;ve ever been in my life and is what Detroit would have been today if not for being propped up by the Federal government. It was also a glimpse of America&rsquo;s future if current trends continue&hellip;&hellip;and it&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t take long to get there at the current rate of disintegration.</p>

		<p>It is a sad commentary on American higher education that academics do not feel free to speak their mind until they are retired.</p>
<p>In any case, that was a good read.  It is true that if you put a group of ethnically similar people in one place and leave them alone you will most likely get their &#8220;brown dog&#8221; within a generation or two.  The problem is that certain groups have &#8220;brown dogs&#8221; that are likely to bite and are prone to &#8220;mange.&#8221;<br>

		<p>I was stationed in Korea shortly after the end of the war. I patrolled and flew over many very, very poor villages. Several things impressed me. There was no trash laying about, everything was picked up. They even swept the dirt courtyards. Everyone was clean and everyone worked, no matter what you did at least you did something. When I returned State-side I remember the &#8220;poverty&#8221; in America. Dirty, lazy shiftless people who lived in conditions a poor Korean would find repulsive.</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree. There were always deep divisons within white Americans. That&rsquo;s why we have such a bitter culture war between whites who live in blue states and ones who live in red states. Whites from New Jersey don&rsquo;t have a whole lot in common culturally with whites from Alabama or Montana. </p>
<p>But these divisions shouldn&rsquo;t be seen by white nationalists as a stumbling block. There will never be a unified white American nation anyway. The future of the United States will be the Disunited States. Whites in Alabama will have their own nation separate from non-whites as well as separate from white people from New Jersey. </p>

		<p>Seems the samething happens with horses. Some years ago I saw a documentary about wild mustangs. This man had a bunch of them on his land out in Montana or somewhere. He said he was starting to see horses that looked like Przewalksi&rsquo;s wild horse which is believed to be the ancestor to our domesticated horses.</p>
<p>Przewalski&rsquo;s wild horse is rather small in size, is a dun (tan) color, has a dark line down its back, and a short mane like a zebra. I actually have a horse that is half Paint and half Thoroughbred. Although he&rsquo;s tall (from the Thoroughbred), he has the dun color, the dark line down his back, and his mane, although not as short as a zebra&rsquo;s, is short conpared to most horses. I guess you could say he&rsquo;s a throwback. </p>
<p>Hmmm, makes me wonder what we will look like as this race mixing continues. It&rsquo;s rather scary.        </p>

		<p>Sometimes, I suspect, the most frightening thing about the squalor and crime and trash and sub-civilized environment of most blacks is that they don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>While whites are horrified at ghetto living it may not mean a whole lot to blacks - who ultimately seem rather unconcerned whether they live in a garbage pit or a suburban McMansion (soon to become a garbage pit anyway).</p>
<p>Dealing with such a mindset is something whites must understand if the US is to survive. </p>

		<p>In a similar vein, the brown dogs theory holds true in California.  As California becomes more like Mexico, the culture shifts from Anglo-Saxon to Chicano.  </p>

Those who believe that economic deprivation causes crime must account for James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein&rsquo;s portrait of an urban community that has suffered severe poverty but little crime. During the 1960s, San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown had the city&rsquo;s lowest income, highest unemployment rate and highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 a year. Yet in 1965, the authors note, there were only five people of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.<br>

		<p>An &#8220;America&#8221; racially balkanized into separate race-based nations will ultimately result in the ecological collapse of the former America. And before the point of ecological collapse arrives, there will be violent conflict among the new race-based nation nations for the remaining scarce resources..there will be no secure and safe White Homeland when the White homeland is surrounded by heavily armed nonwhite areas that are themselves experiencing ecological collapse. The laws of physics won&rsquo;t cease to operate because Native Born White Americans have drawn a new border deep in the interior of the former America&hellip;this time around, the White American borders will be right up against China&rsquo;s new genetic borders&hellip;China has already planted a flag in Montana.</p>

Funny, I made the same observation in Indiana. Long time ago I used to be the newspaper lady and drove 200 miles per route. I knew eveybody&rsquo;s dog and everybody&rsquo;s mailbox. Just like you can immediately tell if a farm is Amish owned around here, (not counting in the buggy give a way)the Germans just had their places tidier. </p>

		<p>This is an extremely important article. Yes the Brown Dog idea is good, but really, it gets us thinking as to what would have happened (or what life would be like) if each human race had its own planet to operate. We can absolutely extrapolate from what Mr. Kay has noticed here. He speculated on &#8216;ends&rsquo; as in, telos. So what is the &#8220;end-goal&#8221; of each human group, partly influenced by genetics and partly by culture? Euroworld, Afroworld and Asiaworld would be very different, but is the &#8216;maintenance&rsquo; of each of these &#8216;types&rsquo; all that is going on here? If we could employ the old idea of human progress for a moment, it seems each brown dog exists as a somewhat stable state situation, but also that a brown dog type contains within itself the capacity for growth (cultural evolution). The Jews of East Europe were freed by the American cultural milieu or meme to advance themselves into their more natural situation, almost like a cultural Flynn Effect. We should be thinking a lot more along these lines and commenting about them. Thank you Mr. Kay.</p>

<p>White societies reflect certain virtues and abilities we have that other races do not.  But they also are an expression of our free will and choice.  So are the societies of non-whites.</p>
<p>Effort has alot to do with that expression.  And here is where the real problem is.  Because whites are under attack from a hostile alien culture, much of OUR effort goes into non-white societies.  Not just feeding, clothing and providing needful things but trillions are spent enabling the worst traits and vices these non-whites have.  An example is welfare, which, because of that hostile alien culture&rsquo;s evil influence, is easily converted into drugs, creating a vast black market and widespread sick behaviors where ordinarily there would not be.</p>
<p>One might ponder how our white society would be different if such effort was redirected toward our own way of life and non-whites and this hostile alien culture that lives parasitically attached to us were expelled.</p>
<p>Again, choice plays a heavy hand in this.  If it didn&rsquo;t, whites would be what we are without any worry about any of this racial nonsense.  Unfortunately it DOES have alot to do with it.  Whites must choose to see these things happening and stop pretending we don&rsquo;t know what is going on (even though almost all know the truth but keep in denial for various reasons).  Then, it&rsquo;s simply a matter of saying no. No to taxes to go to welfare for non-whites.  No to foreign wars that serve no purpose but to intimidate the victims of that hostile invading culture, to keep them from retaliating.  No to contact with non-whites and certainly no to non-white crime.</p>

		<p>I noticed in Missouri that you can tell a difference between the historically German towns (as evidenced by the Lutheran, UCC, and Catholic churches) and the British (probably mostly Scotch-Irish) ones (as evidenced by Baptist and Pentecostal churches).  The German towns along the Missouri River are much tidier and well-maintained.</p>

		<p>Years ago I used to travel regularly by el-train from Chicago to the western suburbs.  As you looked down on the typical Chicago bungalows, you saw an abrupt change from the messy, junk-filled back yards in the Black and Hispanic neighborhoods to the tidy, well-cared-for Bohemian and Polish back yards.  You could tell exactly where one neighborhood stopped and the next began.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Those who believe that economic deprivation causes crime must account for James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein&rsquo;s portrait of an urban community that has suffered severe poverty but little crime. During the 1960s, San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown had the city&rsquo;s lowest income, highest unemployment rate and highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 a year. Yet in 1965, the authors note, there were only five people of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.<br>
<a href="https://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n32_v10/ai_15716060/" rel="nofollow">https://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_n32_v10/ai_15716060/</a> &#8216;</p>
<p>I became a San Francisco Police Officer in the realy 1960&rsquo;s.  Wilson never came to San Francisco.  He never spoke with police who dealt with Chinatown.  </p>
<p>All he did was look at the prison population statistics.  Had he ever come to San Francisco and spoken with the police and District Attroney&rsquo;s office he would have known about the main businesses:<br>
 extortion, illegal gambling, loan sharking at 600 percent interest, prostititution and sex slavery, human trafficking, insurance and every other kind of fraud, use of false identities, total refusal to obey any and all zoning, building and business and industrial code, total disregard of state labor laws and all the other crime that went on in Chinatown then and now.</p>
<p>The average reported income may have been  $4,000 but the unreported income was thousands more. That unreported cash by the way led to all sorts of home robberies as the Chinese kept thousands in cash  at home.  The victims never reported the robberies as they would have been killed.</p>
<p>Another thing, $4,000 per year was not the worst income in the early 60&rsquo;s.  Bank tellers made $60.00 per week, $3,200 per year.<br>
School teachers and police officers made about $5,000 or $6,000 per year, so $4,000 was a normal working class income. The minimum wage was about $1 an hour.  A minimum wage workers made about $2,500 per year.  Airline stewardesses made about $300 per month.  Attorneys made about $9,000 to $13,000 per year although a few attorneys made much, much more.</p>
<p>As I say, Wilson never spoke with San Francisco law enforcement about Chinatown crime.  He just looked at some statistics that were flawed because A Chinese never reported their income. B Chinese criminals took care to prey only on Chinese who were told that they and their families would be killed if they reported the crimes.</p>
<p>Wilson should have investigated the Chinese owned Shaw Hotel which from the 1960&rsquo;s to the 1990&rsquo;s was a major warehouse for the storage of heroin just arrived from China.</p>

		<p>Poster #9-  My wife and I also went to the Bahamas on our honeymoon in 2003. It was a beautiful area, as we stayed at the Wyndham on the main drag of Nassau. We went over to Atlantis and played a few games in the casino.  We got on the local transport bus and we decided to go through the neighborhoods. It looked a lot like some poor areas of Cleveland, where I live. I am White as is my Wife and daughter. </p>
<p>Later than night after a rather uneventful (thank God) trip thru the slums my new bride said she was scared for her life on that bus. We were the only Whites to be seen for miles. We had a pleasant trip and this was really before my racial moment of clarity. I would not do something like that again. If we have the financial resources in the future to visit the Caribbean, it will be to strictly stay in the &#8220;resort&#8221; (read, White, Asian and &#8220;tourist&#8221; blacks) who also were uncomfortable on the town buses down there. </p>
<p>Another great mystery in Northeast Ohio is the amount of $ being dumped into poverty and crime-rampant neighborhoods to build $350,000 + homes in the same areas where gangbangers sling crack and heroin. Not even the decent blacks want to spend their money on a house by these types. Why would a White family do it, save for suicide, both cultural and literal. </p>

		<p>This is a very good article, spot on. The truth is so refreshing! One line struck me in particular, on black neighbourhoods; &#8220;The tip-offs are litter and graffiti everywhere..&#8221; SO TRUE. I just can&rsquo;t believe how blacks litter so much. They just throw their waste and trash everywhere. Its as if they have some aversion to putting litter in a garbage-can or trash receptacle. Any black &#8220;carnival&#8221; or &#8220;parade&#8221; or such nonsense, will end in a sea of litter and trash, with complete disregard for the numerous trash cans all around them. Any city worker can tell you this. Its the same in the Caribbean. Trash and litter everywhere. </p>

<p>Thanks for this post.  When I read the previous one you have commented on, I thought to myself; &#8220;What about the Tong, and all the stuff I used to hear about?&#8221;  In the 1960s, you could walk through China town, but as a white and outsider, you were viewed with caution and a blank expression.  In the Sacramento Valley, along the Sacramento River is a little town called &#8220;Locke.&#8221;  There&rsquo;s a famous little restaurant there called &#8220;Al the Wop&rsquo;s,&#8221; but it is a historical Chinese town, full of strange history and intrigue right up to the last time I saw the place in 1995.  When I used to drive by it on the levee in the 1970s, and stop in to walk around a little, it was always spooky, with an Oriental face looking out of a window here and there.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered if it was an active opium town even then.</p>
<p>I would love to hear a former law enforcement officer reply to me here with some police history about Locke, if you have any.</p>

<p>I appreciate what your saying and I&rsquo;m sure its true. Still at least Chinese crime and violence was strictly within the Chinese community. They didn&rsquo;t attack or prey on whites in anything like the sense blacks did and do. I would much rather take my chances, in the 1960&rsquo;s or now, walking around alone at night in any Chinatown over a black area. </p>
<p>Reply to #26:</p>
<p>I agree. Its a really good idea to always pay cash for your gas. Gas stations are just too easy a format for scams to be set up at. Also, always fill up during the day and never go below a half tank. You don&rsquo;t want to run the risk of ever running out of gas at the wrong time or place. It can happen easy enough. </p>

It is very true that Chinese keep their crime in their own communities.  They do not commit violent crime against Whites.</p>
<p>They are however, at the forefront of white collar crime such as medical and other insurance fraud.  When they buy 7 $300,000 copy machines under a false name with the minimal down payment and then close the shop and resell the machines as soon as the machines are delivered it does not hurt the Chinese community.</p>
<p>It hurts the company that sold the machines to the scam artist in good faith.</p>

Whites are still entirely ON TOP. No one CAN challenge us. We are just cringing over the prospect of losing our comforts. That&rsquo;s all. As long as we cling to the corrupt system we allowed to grow every day, under our own noses, and in plain sight, we (white men and women who aren&rsquo;t limp marxists), will continue to have our spheres of influence narrowed and narrowed, including the fields where we totally rule; the military, police, Fire, etc. <br>
Nobody here is beaten.<br>
We just feel (rightly, albeit unrealistically) abused by an extremely corrupt world, where morality is optional. Our old values are out of style. It is unrealistic for us to shout out about how it&rsquo;s all a travesty. This is the way of the world. We&rsquo;re just witnessing the same old chicanery and lies in a new style. (the two critical differences being the planet has about 7 billion people, and probably one out of eleven or so is white&hellip;also,this really is the death of a culture and a nation.</p>
<p>But it is NOT the death of a people, or white, normal- headed maleness. That only happens with our PERMISSION.<br>

<p>Poly ethnic states have an aggressive foreign policy to deflect their inner contradiction, till they are exhausted. Mono ethnic states are turned on themselves, but are potentially more dangerous because of their efficiency. The problem with nationalism is, that it means distinct things. With nation, it terms or does not distinguish the institutions and territory, and the ethnic group, or groups, for which they are intended to be. Naturally, without questioning their necessity, the former can change and are subordinate to the latter. I believe, that this confusion in our rank is even more harmful to whites, than liberal ideologies. Not least because we pretend to be their advocates.</p>

Since the mid-1970s, the hub of Russian organized crime in the U.S. has been the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn, New York, known as &#8216;Little Odessa.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>For example, in 2010:</p>
<p><i>Forty-four alleged members and associates of an Armenian-American organized crime ring were arrested and charged with racketeering, identity theft and money laundering</i>  <b>in the largest single Medicare fraud ever charged</b> <i>in a statement released by the Department of Justice.</i></p>
<p>A better question is this:  Why are we importing criminals to prey on the Native Born American Population??</p>

		<p>Genes influence culture by regulating the growth of the human brain.  Even if they wanted to, a race with an average IQ of 65 (see Congo) could not create an advanced culture, or even maintain one left behind by another race.</p>
<p>However, culture also influences genes, by deciding which members (especially males) are allowed to reproduce.  Why, for example, is Japan such a peaceful, law-abiding society?  You&rsquo;ll find the answer engraved on the tang of any old Japanese katana:  &#8220;This sword sliced through five bodies [of executed criminals] in one blow&#8221;.  Over hundreds of years, that&rsquo;s a pretty strong selective pressure against criminal behavior.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And before the point of ecological collapse arrives, there will be violent conflict among the new race-based nation nations for the remaining scarce resources..there will be no secure and safe White Homeland when the White homeland is surrounded by heavily armed nonwhite areas that are themselves experiencing ecological collapse.&#8221;</p>

Better, cleaner safer power plants, new Nuclear plant designs, More trees now than ever, more oil discovered every day, more and better mining, the asteroids are literally mountains of stainless steel, gold, unlimited amounts of any materials you need.

<p>&#8220;Those who believe that economic deprivation causes crime must account for James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein&rsquo;s portrait of an urban community that has suffered severe poverty but little crime. During the 1960s, San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown had the city&rsquo;s lowest income, highest unemployment rate and highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 a year. Yet in 1965, the authors note, there were only five people of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.<br>
Both Engleman and Wilson contend that $4,000 income was poverty level in 1965.  </p>
<p>Per capita income in the United States in 1965 was $3,335.  Thus<br>
the Chinese of San Francisco were no more poor than any other average working lower middle class people.</p>
<p>As I posted before, that $4,000 cited by the incredible naive and gullible Wilson was only reported income.  Most income generated in Chinatown was unreported cash.</p>
<p>I was born in San Francico in 1942.  I was raised in the inner Richmond and attended Arguello Jr high  and Washington High school.  The inner Richmond was maybe 80 percent White, 20 percent Chinese as it was close to Chinatown and a natural move.</p>
<p>The entire time I lived in San Francisco from early childhood until retirement from the police in 1996, there was absolutely no perception that Chinese were poor.  In all those years I never saw any Chinese person who looked poor.  They were unknown on the welfare rolls except for retirement and senior citizen housing.</p>
<p>The reason why Chinese San Franciscans never applied for food stamps and dependent children aid is because they did not need the help because they had sufficient income to take care of their families.</p>
<p>Another fact Wilson seems not to have known is that the Chinese in San Francisco in 1965 were Americans.  California excluded Chinese in the 1880&rsquo;s I believe 1882.  Almost all the San Francisco Chinese in 1965 were 3rd, and 4th generation Americans.  Some Chinese of course did trickle in before the 1965<br>
Hart Cellar act of course.</p>
<p>But most were old native born Americans.</p>
<p>I joined the San Francisco police when I was 22 years old.  I could go on and on about the frauds and white collar crimes committed in San Francisco and every Chinatown in the country.</p>
<p>When I moved out of my parent&rsquo;s house I rented an apartment.  When I got married we rented a house in the Sunset for a few years before we bought our own house.</p>
<p>Both landlords were Chinese.  Both landlords owned numerous houses and apartment buildings all over San Francisco.  Neither were considered specially rich, just ordinary landlords.</p>
<p>I certainly did not go looking for Chinese landlords.  Just saw the ads in the paper, looked at the place and rented it.  Both landlords were good landlords by the way.</p>
<p>Whatever the merits of Wilson&rsquo;s study, his reports on San Francisco Chinese is totally flawed.  Why did he concentrate on the tourist China town area?  Why didn&rsquo;t he go to the Sunset and Richmond where thousands of Chinese lived alongside with Whites?</p>
<p>Why did he not notice the numerous Chinese civil servants who took the exams and passed in honest competition with Whites?  This was before affirmative action of course.   Why did he not notice that even in 1965 half the restaurants on Geary and Clement streets were owned by Chinese and very prosperous?</p>
<p>Did Wilson ever set foot in San Francisco?  I know he never contacted the San FRancisco police and federal and state police like the FBI about Chinese crime.  He really should have contacted the DEA.  They would have told him about the Chinese owned Shaw hotel where much of the heroin brought into the US was stored.</p>

		<p>Interesting. The term may be called cultural archetype or perhaps social archetype. Or how about race-culture archetype? Anyway, it is the characteristics of a place resulting from the race that resides in it as opposed to the place, or circumstances thereof, driving the characteristics of a race. Oh, if we could only maintain the clear and simple analytical capabilities of my dearly departed Anglo-Saxon grandmother who said she didn&rsquo;t like blacks because they steal and are dirty and violent.

		<p>I&rsquo;m poster #26.  Thank you Bon for backing me up.</p>
<p>It was not just criminals that the Russians sent under the guise of Jewish refugee resettlement. It was hordes of middle aged and older mentally disabled people.</p>
<p>I lived quite close to the Jewish community center and several of the major Temples and offices of Jewish organizations in my large California city.</p>
<p>Those organizations helped and settled thousands of those middle aged and elderly mentally disabled people who claimed to be Jewish refugees in our neighborhood.</p>
<p>Here is just 1 thing I witnessed.  Many of the rummage sales in my city are held in a building of the major city park.  The older mentally disabled Russian soi disant Jews found about these rummage sales early on.</p>
<p>Every Saturday and Wednesday when the sales were held, the Russians would arrive about 3 in the afternoon.  They were equipped with 60 gallon trash bags, the sturdy ones for plant clippings.  Around 4, when the sale was closing down, the Russians would charge in and grab all the unsold merchandise in a mad rush of  old people.  Healthy young Russians waited outside and ran the trash bags to waiting pickup trucks.</p>
<p>I had heard about the rummage sales.  When I worked at the rummage sale for my daughter&rsquo;s private school I saw it in action.</p>
<p>It was the funniest thing I have ever seen.  We collapsed in laughter as these middle aged and elderly ran about grabbing everything they could.</p>
<p>Supposedly the clothes and other things were sold in the second hand shops the Russians set up.</p>
<p>That is just one example of Russian immigrant crime.  A second hand store whose merchandise is stolen from rummage sales is very profitable because it doesn&rsquo;t have to buy its stock.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d take Russian criminals over black criminals any time.  No Russian boys or men ever snatched a purse, raped or attacked anyone on the street as the blacks do.</p>
<p>Had so many blacks been settled in the neighborhood by charitable organizations, it would have been White flight and the destruction of the neighborhood in a few years.</p>
<p>I have posted this again and again.  Just because an ethnic group does not have hordes of its young men robbing, murdering, pillaging  and raping as the blacks do does not mean they are non criminal.</p>
<p>It just means they are more intelligent criminals.</p>
<p>By the way, a lot of people in law enforcement don&rsquo;t think the daisy chain gasoline tax fraud just accidentally happened.  The people who did it had to know the incredibly complex state, federal and local gas tax regulations.</p>
<p>How did they learn about it?  There are thousands of clever frauds.  But this one  had never been done before.</p>
<p>Best bet is either the old Italian mafia, the Russian government or the people who lobbied for the Russian refugees to come here.</p>

<p>Korean owned gas stations in the San Francisco Bay Area are well known for rigging their gas pumps.  The San Francisco, Alameda, San Mateo and Contra Costa counties district attorney&rsquo;s offices all have full time investigators dealing with this problem.</p>
<p>It happened to me.  Some Koreans bought the gas station nearest to me where I always bought my gas.  Usually I filled it when the gauge read 1/4 full.  It always needed 9 gallons to fill the tank.</p>
<p>After the Koreans bought the station, I needed 10 or 11 gallons.  I thought, oh well, gas gauges are never really accurate, the car is getting old.</p>
<p>Then one day the pump read 12 gallons.  I pulled the owner&rsquo;s manual out of the glove compartment and read it.  The maximum capacity of my gas tank was exactly 11 gallons.  Since the gauge always read 1/4 full when I filled up, the tank was never empty enough to take 11 or 12 gallons.</p>
<p>Right across the street a Korean bought the dry cleaner&rsquo;s.  After a year or so people noticed that all those beige trench coats and other light colored clothes he cleaned were filthy.</p>
<p>He never did dip the clothes in the cleaning fluid.  He just pressed them and charged for cleaning and pressing.</p>
<p>Because these crooked businessmen are non White, their kids get preference in college admissions.  They are entitled to good jobs because they are non White.  And we can be sure that they bought those businesses with which they cheated Americans with US goverment SBA loans, tax write offs and all the other help the American goverment gives anything and everything non White.</p>

<p>I know of many, many Russians and Ukrainians who have immigrated to the Northwest. There is a criminal element, to be sure, but there is a larger populations of people who got here due to conversion to Baptist or Pentecostal Protestantism.  They vote Republican as they are taught to at church.  The young are the best students and often gifted athletes,handsome men, gorgeously beautiful women.

Absolutely!   Why should our criminals want to go anywhere else? This is their nirvana!  Where else could criminals operate so freely, so easily, so profitably?  Where else could they enjoy such toleration, such exemption from the rules orfrom  punishment, such an array of loopholes,  such pliable <br>
politicians, such gullible clerics, such sympathetic media?   </p>
<p>The US (and Canada) are heaven on earth for them.  They have have found their pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s appropriate to mention though, that  &#8220;our&#8221; criminals were originally someone else&rsquo;s.  Very few of them originated here on US soil, even though they have now acquired American accents and externals. </p>

Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate&hellip;<br>
 <br>
High arrest and incarceration rates for blacks and Hispanics &mdash; and very low rates for Asians &mdash; reflect differences in crime rates, not police or justice system bias&hellip;<br>
 <br>
In total, blacks had the highest incarceration rate at 7.2 times the white rate, followed by Hispanics, at 2.9 times the white rate. Indians and Pacific Islanders were imprisoned at about<br>
twice the white rate, and Asians at only 22 percent of the white rate&hellip;<br>
 <br>
incarceration rates for Pacific Islanders (most are Hawaiians) are almost always higher than those for whites, while Asian rates are always lower&hellip;<br>
 <br>
There is only one category of crime for which Asians unfortunately, this figure includes Pacific Islanders) are<br>
more likely to be arrested than whites, and that is gambling, which is deeply rooted in some Asian cultures&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Asians are much less likely to commit crimes than whites&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Blacks are considerably more likely than any other group to commit crimes of virtually all kinds, while Asians are least likely. Whites and Hispanics have intermediate crime rates&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Blacks are about eight times more likely than whites to commit murder, and 25 times more likely than Asians to do so. Blacks are 15 times more likely than whites to go to prison for robbery,<br>
and 50 times more likely than Asians&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Hispanics are one of the more crimeprone groups in America. They also have high rates of illegitimacy, school failure, poverty, welfare use, and teen pregnancy. Asians are lowest in all these<br>
categories. <br>

For the past twenty years I have studied race differences in brain size, intelligence, sexuality,personality, growth rate, life span, crime, and family stability. On all of these traits, Orientals fall at one end of the spectrum, Blacks fall at the other end, and Whites fall in between&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Many statistics in Chart 1 come from the United States, where Orientals are a &ldquo;model minority.&rdquo; They have fewer divorces, fewer out-of-wedlock births, and fewer reports of child abuse than Whites. More Orientals graduate from college and fewer go to prison&hellip; <br>
    <br>
Orientals are under-represented in U.S. crime statistics&hellip;<br>
 <br>
A 1996 government commission in Ontario, Canada, reported that Blacks were five times more likely go to jail than Whites, and 10 times more likely than Orientals. In Brazil, there are 1.5 million Orientals, mostly Japanese whose ancestors went there as<br>
laborers in the 19th century, and who are the least represented in crime&hellip;<br>

<p>Welfare Use Among Elderly Immigrants</p>
<p>As someone who has been immersed in the Chinese immigrant community for 20 years, I became interested in usage of public assistance among that group, particularly in the SSI welfare program. Drawing upon 1990 California Census data and many interviews with those involved, I found that: </p>
<p><br>
Despite their Model Minority image, approximately 55% of elderly Chinese immmigrants were on welfare, a striking contrast to the 9% figure for native-born seniors. <br>
The Chinese seniors who immigrate these days do not consider receiving welfare to be a stigma. On the contrary, they view it as a normal benefit of immigration, whose use is actually encouraged, like a library card. They are unaware of the fact that welfare is intended only as a safety net. </p>
<p>The immigrant Chinese senior welfare recipients do not need the money. This is true by definition, because at the time a senior immigrates, his/her children must demonstrate to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that they have the financial resources to be able to support the parent. </p>
<p>Through Chinese-language books and newspapers, and most importantly through an extremely efficient word-of-mouth process, the Chinese seniors are exceedingly well-informed about welfare. </p>
<p>In recent years most Chinese seniors immigrate to the U.S. with the advance intention of going on welfare. Moreover, even Chinese immigrant advocacy groups admit that the seniors&rsquo; adult children who sponsor them to immigrate also have this advance intention. </p>
<p>The noble intentions of &#8220;family-reunification&#8221; provisions under which the children sponsor their elderly parents to immigrate often bear little or no resemblance to reality. Indeed, Asian-American community activist and immigrant advocate Bob Kim has noted that cancellation of SSI benefits would force many immigrant seniors to &#8220;move back [in] with families that don&rsquo;t want them.&#8221; </p>
<p>The children who do have their elderly parents living with them often actually make a profit from their parents&rsquo; SSI checks. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the immigrant seniors on welfare come from middle-class families with above-average household incomes. </p>
<p>The 1996 welfare reform legislation will not do much to reduce SSI usage by elderly immigrants. However, it will produce some reduction in Medicaid usage by this group. <br>
The legal mandate of the INS to exclude applicants for immigration who are &#8220;likely to become a public charge&#8221; is widely flouted, since in recent years both the immigrants and their children plan in advance for the seniors to go on welfare. This point is of central importance. In investigating the problems of explosive growth in SSI usage by immigrants in recent years, it is appropriate to distinguish between immigrant and native recipients, because the immigrants were only allowed into the country on the strength of their  &mdash;  and their children&rsquo;s  &mdash;  promises that they would not make use of welfare. </p>

<p>Exactly!  Mr Engleman is solely concerned about someone who might mug him.    That is his very limited obsession.  His sole concern about &#8220;crime&#8221; is VIOLENT crime.   Since Chinese,  Armenianians,  Arabs,  Jews, Vietnamese,  Koreans, etc. are unlikely to knock him on the head in the street,   then they are fine with him.  They are welcome to come  in and replace us. </p>
<p>Thus, it is all about HIM.  They can rob society all they want, but please just don&rsquo;t  mug him!  Robbing others in sneaky ways is OK, so long as they don&rsquo;t shoot or stab.  </p>
<p>PS, Mr. Was There:  I neglected to commend you on a a most outsanding post.  Every word in it was absolutely true. I remember it well.  I was there too!</p>

High arrest and incarceration rates for blacks and Hispanics &mdash; and very low rates for Asians &mdash; reflect differences in crime rates, not police or justice system bias&hellip;</p>
<p>In total, blacks had the highest incarceration rate at 7.2 times the white rate, followed by Hispanics, at 2.9 times the white rate. Indians and Pacific Islanders were imprisoned at about<br>
twice the white rate, and Asians at only 22 percent of the white rate&hellip;</p>
<p>incarceration rates for Pacific Islanders (most are Hawaiians) are almost always higher than those for whites, while Asian rates are always lower&hellip;</p>
<p>There is only one category of crime for which Asians unfortunately, this figure includes Pacific Islanders) are<br>
more likely to be arrested than whites, and that is gambling, which is deeply rooted in some Asian cultures&hellip;</p>
<p>Asians are much less likely to commit crimes than whites&hellip;<br>

For the past twenty years I have studied race differences in brain size, intelligence, sexuality,personality, growth rate, life span, crime, and family stability. On all of these traits, Orientals fall at one end of the spectrum, Blacks fall at the other end, and Whites fall in between&hellip;</p>
<p>Many statistics in Chart 1 come from the United States, where Orientals are a &ldquo;model minority.&rdquo; They have fewer divorces, fewer out-of-wedlock births, and fewer reports of child abuse than Whites. More Orientals graduate from college and fewer go to prison&hellip; </p>
<p>Orientals are under-represented in U.S. crime statistics&hellip;</p>
<p>A 1996 government commission in Ontario, Canada, reported that Blacks were five times more likely go to jail than Whites, and 10 times more likely than Orientals. In Brazil, there are 1.5 million Orientals, mostly Japanese whose ancestors went there as<br>
laborers in the 19th century, and who are the least represented in crime&hellip;</p>

According to Jared Taylor and Philippe Rushton Orientals have lower rates of white collar crime than whites. Illegal gambling does not threaten me. Professor Rushton also said that Oriental teenage boys are more likely to join gangs than whites. Those are probably for self defense against blacks and Hispanics.</p>

<p>Of course, illegal gambling  doesn&rsquo;t bother YOU when ASIANS do it. Any vice Asians have doesn&rsquo;t concern YOU..since you belong to the Asian Club. </p>
<p>Of course the reason they ONLY join gangs according to you, is &#8220;probably&#8221; for self defense against blacks and hispanics&hellip;.I really had to gag at that one!</p>

		<p>#30 &amp; 45.  Of course, primary racial inheritance and identity are not the only or necessarily decisive factors in human history, including conflict. Civilization and warfare are complex concepts.  <br>
However, (1) if whites have fought one another despite being the &#8220;same&#8221; race/colour, the (actually impossible) notion of making all human beings the &#8220;same&#8221; race/colour through compulsory universal miscegenation to prevent all future conflict, would therefore also be a waste of effort in that respect.<br>
(2) White nationalists do not (need to) deny their past conflicts, but they do need to overcome them to create a political and biological solidarity in relation to other racial challenges (e.g. China). </p>
