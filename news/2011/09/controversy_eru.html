<h1><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2011/09/25/us/california-racial-bake-sale/index.html">Controversy Erupts over Campus Republicans Bake Sale Plans</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>CNN, September 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Campus Republicans at the University of California Berkeley have cooked up a storm of controversy with their plans for a bake sale.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not your everyday collegiate fundraiser they&rsquo;ve got in mind. They&rsquo;ve developed a sliding scale where the price of the cookie or brownie depends on your gender and the color of your skin.</p>
<p>During the sale, scheduled for Tuesday, baked goods will be sold to white men for $2.00, Asian men for $1.50, Latino men for $1.00, black men for $0.75 and Native American men for $0.25. All women will get $0.25 off those prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pricing structure is there to bring attention, to cause people to get a little upset,&#8221; Campus Republican President Shawn Lewis, who planned the event, told CNN-affiliate KGO. &#8220;But it&rsquo;s really there to cause people to think more critically about what this kind of policy would do in university admissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lewis says it&rsquo;s a way to make a statement about pending legislation that would let the California universities consider race or national origin during the admission process.</p>
<p>But the young Republicans have been on the receiving end of a fierce backlash. {snip}</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&rsquo;t expect the volume, the amount of response that we got,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;In the first few hours, hundreds of posts on our Facebook page. And the tone of some of the responses  &mdash;  we expected people to be upset. We didn&rsquo;t expect personal threats to be made. They were implicit and explicit threats made to the organizers of the event, from burning down the table to throwing our baked goods at us and other kinds of physical threats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tim Wise, author of the book &#8220;White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son,&#8221; calls the bake sale a &#8220;sarcastic and rather smarmy slap at people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I get the joke,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;How very original. It&rsquo;s been done for 15 years. The point that I think needs to be made &hellip; is that by the time anyone steps on a college campus &hellip; there has already been 12- to 13-years of institutionalized affirmative action for white folks, that is to say, racially embedded inequality, which has benefited those of us who are white. And it&rsquo;s only at the point of college admissions that these folks seem to get concerned with color consciousness.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The diversity elites, both those White elites who say we shall embrace diversity and inclusion and those privileged Affirmative Action black elites who say you must embrace us, will not tolerate diversity being framed in any way that points out how hostile and dangerously anti white it is.</p>
<p>The elites must control the message, and when reality breaks out, the fall back on cries of &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Fortunately, with the open Internet, the censorship has competition.  Look for the Internet to shut down over &#8220;hate speech shouldn&rsquo;t be free&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our glimmers of hope are reduced to joy over bake sales?  We&rsquo;ve come too far now to expect anything other than more genocide.<br>

		<p>Great touch.  CNN gets Time Wise to comment.  Unless my memory fails me, Tim Wise was the bigot that was gloating about whites becoming extinct.  So we have a genocidal creep as CNNs &#8220;expert&#8221;.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m currently attending University right now. I receieve BAH (a basic allowance for housing) and all of my books are paid for. Now I&rsquo;ll let readers guess whether I&rsquo;m showered with these perks because I&rsquo;m white or because of four years of military service. And did Tim Wise, he of &#8220;Open Letter&#8221; fame accuse someone of being smarmy and sarcastic? That&rsquo;s about as plausible as the ghost of Teddy Kennedy rising from the grave and calling someone an alcoholic.</p>

		<p>Tim Wise: &#8220;&hellip;by the time anyone steps on a college campus &hellip; there has already been 12- to 13-years of institutionalized affirmative action for white folks, that is to say, racially embedded inequality, which has benefited those of us who are white.&#8221;</p>
<p>You mean &#8220;12- to 13-years of institutionalized affirmative action AGAINST white folks,&#8221; don&rsquo;t you, Tim?  Because that is the reality of K-12 schooling: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning in the early 1980s &hellip; the most effective way to upgrade the status of students whose academic performance in school had barely changed &hellip; was not so much to enhance it positively through celebratory readings but to reduce the moral and cultural status of the mainstream. To do so, they [educators] began to load the history and literature curriculum with literary works &hellip; that stressed the flaws and failings of the United States &hellip; Although this literature became known facetiously as &lsquo;victim lit&rsquo; or &lsquo;white-guilt lit&rsquo; for its highlighting of a group&rsquo;s victimization by white Americans, many teachers believed it was useful precisely because it served to elevate a minority group&rsquo;s moral status &hellip; and create guilt in white students &hellip;&rdquo; (Losing Our Language: How Multicultural Classroom Instruction is Undermining Our Children&rsquo;s Ability to Read, Write, and Reason, by Sandra Stotsky, 1999, p49)<br>
 <br>
In Losing our Language, Professor Stotsky, then a Research Associate at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, examined &ldquo;the contents of the leading readers for grades 4 and 6 published in 1993 and 1995.&rdquo; Five years later, in The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn (2003), research professor Diane Ravitch would reveal how textbook publishers efficiently generate the required content for the new approach. Their key instrument: comically elaborate &ldquo;bias and sensitivity guidelines&rdquo;  &mdash;  some of which, with great difficulty, Ravitch was able to obtain. Below is her description of the guidelines of publishing giant McGraw-Hill:<br>
 <br>
&ldquo;The MH guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo;  say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo;  European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (p44) </p>
<p>My favorite example, though, of the exquisite sensitivity of the textbook and testing industry to the ideological demands of selling to school systems is an incident Ravitch shared about her 1998 service on the National Assessment Governing Board, the supervisory body for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Ravitch, a Clinton appointee, worked on a subcommittee tasked to review fourth grade reading passages intended for what would have become a voluntary national test: </p>
<p>&ldquo;After I had read about a dozen such passages, a combination of fiction and nonfiction, I realized that the readings themselves had a cumulative subtext: the hero was never a white boy. Instead, the leading character  &mdash;  the one who was most competent, successful, and sympathetic  &mdash;  was invariably either a girl (of any race) or a nonwhite boy. Almost without exception, white boys were portrayed as weak and dependent. In one story, a white boy in a difficult situation weeps and says plaintively, &lsquo;If only my big sister were here, I would know what to do.&rsquo;&rdquo; (&ldquo;Education After the Culture Wars,&rdquo; Daedalus, Journal of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Summer, 2002) </p>

		<p>Yeah, the Progressives get real irritated when Afirmative Action is demonstrated right out in the open.  As for this character Wise, he makes his money condemning the white race.  He&rsquo;s kind of like a Jew who ran the gas chamber in WW2, except he thinks he is doing a valuable service and enjoys his job.  </p>
<p>He had a meltdown after the 2010 elections didn&rsquo;t go his way and said he couldn&rsquo;t wait for the demise of whitey.</p>

		<p>Would someone please tell me one single social issue of any real relevance or importance that the Republican Party has ever succeeded implimenting in the United States of America? The fact is that the Left, for the last sixty years, has won every single program they have ever sought to impose on Americans. Their success has been so great, it has literally shaken the traditional ideas that created the foundation of this country. If I were a die hard conservative Repubican, I&rsquo;d be hanging my head in shame.</p>

		<p>The one of the many things  that are so glaring about Cultural Marxists: No sense of humor. My only problem with the Republican Affirmative Action bakesale is that the White men should have to pay entirely for the black and hispanic customer&rsquo;s cupcakes. They should also replace the White students selling the cupcakes with Asians on work visas.</p>
<p> I once caught an Indian &#8216;comedian&rsquo; that was given two segments to do brief routines on PBS World. His supposed jokes involved a fantasy about decapitating an elderly White woman who remarked that Asians were well behaved and  he advocated having Black nannies give their White client&rsquo;s children the &#8216;slave name&rsquo; Toby. And this was meant to be funny? You could tell that this guy seethed with resentment and envy. I have his name written down somewhere, I&rsquo;ll have to look for it. It was far more racist than a bake sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;&hellip;here has already been 12- to 13-years of institutionalized affirmative action for white folks, that is to say, racially embedded inequality&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;   &#8220;Tim  the Unwise&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
Tim, did you say RACIALLY embedded inequality? Did you perhaps mean SOCIALLY embedded inequality? Because if that inequality is RACIALLY embedded   &mdash;   as we Race Realists tend to believe it is   &mdash;   you&rsquo;re going to find it awfully difficult to remove. Impossible, even. </p>
<p>Also, does CNN make any mention of &#8220;UCB authorities are of course investigating the threats of violence, as the entire UC system has a Zero Tolerance program regarding physical intimidation of anyone on their campuses&#8221;?</p>
<p>No the article does not. Because threats of violence   &mdash;   or even actual violence   &mdash;   is of absolutely no concern to any authority on any campus in any country in the West nowadays&hellip; as long as that violence is directed exclusively at Straight White Males (preferably Conservatives).</p>
<p>Ah yes, UC Berkeley   &mdash;   birthplace of the potty-mouthed Free Speech Movement, still fondly recalled by every single documentary about the &rsquo;60s. Now, however, Berkeley&rsquo;s protest kids demand not only the right to freely speak their opinions, but also to PHYSICALLY SILENCE anyone with differing opinions.</p>
<p>Oh, and as for that bake sale&rsquo;s price list, I&rsquo;d change it a bit. Now that Asian college enrollment has reached such high levels   &mdash;   not because of any Affirmative Action programs, but only because Asians are, um, like, SMART   &mdash;   some universities actually demand a higher GPA from Asian applicants than they do from Whites. (If you&rsquo;re Brown or Black, you can of course get into the most prestigious institutions in the land merely by handing in an autobiographical essay on your personal victimhood with a title like &#8220;My Struggle to Overcome Systemic White Oppression While Growing Up on the White Man&rsquo;s Welfare in the White Man&rsquo;s Public Housing&#8221;.)</p>
<p>So, technically, the price of cupcakes for Asians should be either the same as for Caucasians, or slightly higher.</p>

		<p>Tim Wise, the &#8220;fat hamster&#8221; of race hustling cannot really believe his allegation of years of privilege before college. Tell that-Tim  &mdash;   to America&rsquo;s 4.6 million white children who live in poverty and to poor white youth who find out that they are ineligible because of their race for the Bill and Melinda Gates Millennium Scholars Program. I went to a high school graduation in June. The valedictorian, salutatorian, the one scholarship winner to Harvard, and the one graduate who received the most prestigious&#8221;full ride&#8221; scholarship to our flagship state university were all NON WHITE. They were exclusively of Asian or (India) Indian ancestry. When will Tim Wise be called to account for his naked racism and hate against poor white children?</p>

		<p>Very very clever :-D</p>
<p>As long as you pay for affirmative action with your taxes, people don&rsquo;t see the real problem. With direct pays they show the problem pretty good.</p>
<p>And about the death-threats:<br>
In every single meeting/website/organisation/whatever of race realists or conservatives there were some lefties making death threats. Still I haven&rsquo;t seen one being killed by lefties.</p>
<p>It is pretty sure why:<br>
Even if you can get this lefties a left-wing court will let them free as &#8220;fighters for freedom&#8221;. They would be heroes. But if they would really kill somebody, there would be no mercy.   </p>

<p>Tim Wise, oh yeah, how original.  He and other Great Society Marxists have only been hammering on about supposed undue white privileges in a majority white society for only 40+ years.  I certainly don&rsquo;t believe that white kids only notice the bias when they get to college.  They only react because now it costs them money and precious time.</p>
<p>And as if Tim Wise is the default expert on equality or anything but his own funding for yet more of his anti-white diatribes, he calls researched.</p>

Time Wise must of slipped his mental leash here. White&rsquo;s pay more than any other race, yet it&rsquo;s a slap in the face to minorities? Are we to believe this club would of gotten his stamp of approval if white&rsquo;s instead, payed the least?</p>
<p>Then he speaks of 12-13 years of white affirmative action. Perhaps for those kids who live in overwhelmingly white towns and school districts, buts that&rsquo;s a function of economic circumstances, not government affirmative action. White people don&rsquo;t get affirmative action beyond their own ability to self segregate and that&rsquo;s usually predicated on having enough $$$$$$$$ to achieve it.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a great irony that Tim un-Wise and the other crybabies don&rsquo;t realize: about 20 years ago a group of college students (I forgot where) published a feminist magazine that was priced &#8220;$1.50 for women and men of color, $2.50 for white men&#8221;.</p>
<p>This predated the Affirmitave Action Bake Sale stunts except the feminists behind it were dead serious.  </p>

Mr. Wise is upset because his enemies started a dialog on race and this is simply unacceptable. He cannot let White Conservatives control the debate so he attempts to kill the messenger along with the message. He can&rsquo;t allow White Conservatives to point to an obvious truth because people might think for themselves and see the truth.</p>
<p>These people say they want a dialog on race but only on their term.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a facebook account so if anyone has a link to the threats that were posted, please proved me with the link.</p>

		<p>I think that it would be more accurate if the white men had to bake the brownies for both themselves and the minorities buying them. Ofcourse the white men would still have to pay more for their self made brownies. </p>
<p>The blacks would have to take the brownies by gunpoint. </p>
<p>The hispanics could go behind the table, say that the brownies used to belong to them and then claim them for themselves. This would be similar to what the Native Americans would do, except they would sit around with the brownie mix, not using it to it&rsquo;s full potential, then when the whites used the mix to make brownies, the Native Americans could complain that the brownies were stolen from them.</p>
<p>And the Asians would have to let the blacks and hispanics steal their brownies. </p>
<p>And ofcourse, all of this confusion would be blamed on the white man.</p>

		<p>I wish people would stop being so cruel to Mr.Wise.  It should be obvious to everyone that he has severe mental problems.  Go read his article where he croons about the extinction of his own race and try to tell me that isn&rsquo;t indicative of someone with deep seated issues and intense self-hatred problems.</p>
<p>Insulting him makes no more sense than ridiculing someone with schizophrenia.  He can&rsquo;t help himself.</p>

		<p>The irony is that Asians have it even more difficult than whites in gaining college admissions. While I applaud the gesture of our good Republican collegians. I would make a small correction. It should be more like:</p>
<p>1. Asians = $ 3.00</p>
<p>2. Whites = $ 2.00</p>
<p>3. Native Americans = $ 1.00</p>
<p>4. Hispanics = $ 0.75</p>
<p>5. Women (Liberal Whites) = $ 0.50</p>
<p>6. Blacks = $ 0.25 </p>

<p>You hate the bake sale because it shows how stupid your idea is. And you&rsquo;ve been giving us the same hateful lies about &#8220;equality&#8221; for 40 years. Lies that ONLY Whites are to listen to and obey. Your &#8220;rules&#8221; don&rsquo;t apply to ANY other ethnicity or race. Your Black pets have been raping, robbing, killing us for over 40 years.

He believes that when White people get ANY job or seat in a college it is only because of affirmative action for White people. Talk about a double standard!</p>

<p>The universities already do.  They never, not even for 1 year obeyed Prop 209.  They simply took off points from SATs and GPAs from Whites and added enough points to the &#8220;poor, poor pitiful me&#8221; essays of blacks and browns.  Blacks and browns are admitted according to the poor, poor, pitiful me essay. Whites and Asians on the basis of grades and testing, although of course Asians are more equal than Whites.</p>

		<p>This is all backwards! To really make the point the pricing scheme should be reversed with black women paying the most! That would really tick them off, and would illustrate the point succinctly when the beneficiaries of AA actually experience real, blatant, and overt discrimination for likely the first time in their life. The kind of discrimination white males face as soon as they turn on the television for the first time, and certainly have endured years of by the time they finish high school.</p>
<p> Cookies for certain minority students should also come with a bill for roughly $70,000.00 for the loss of our cities, reduction in the quality of life, the loss of life due to minority crime, the funding of entitlement programs that rob whites for minority benefit, and the crimes of all of their ancestors (including African slavery) spelled out in bold type.  The event should also feature country &amp; western music blaring loudly from a huge stack of speakers with overpowering bass cannons, a Vietnam memorial type wall commemorating the 70,000,000+ victims of communism, the 60,000,000+ broken families, and millions of dead babies due to feminism.</p>
<p> For the icing on the cake the event should refer minority students to a mandatory racial sensitivity session where they are forced to atone to the white man for their destructive rioting, destruction of government housing projects, welfare dependency, ethnic cleansing of White neighborhoods (White flight), and racially insensitive attitudes, and speech. </p>
<p>Free cookies and fried chicken only for Whites with an invitation to the &#8220;Whites only campus club&#8221;, $.50 a cookie for Asians, and the top most price for Black women at maybe $5 a cookie to illustrate how extreme the discrimination actually is; not just in school admissions, but for government jobs, and even many private sector jobs. Maybe even have a $2 extra fee for diversity type degree seekers such as African studies. </p>
<p>If you want to make a headline across the country do it that way. Yeah, you would get in trouble for creating a &#8220;hostile environment&#8221; if you did it on campus, but isn&rsquo;t that precisely the point?  </p>

<p>The difference is that Asians have pro-Asian groups to defend their interests, with the full blessing of the US government and DOJ.</p>
<p>Try forming a pro-White group and see what happens, as in what happened on meetup.com.  Were there any protests of the strictly Asians groups?  Anyone call them &#8220;racists?&#8221;  Was anyone &#8220;highly offended?&#8221;  If not, why not?  Why are Asians allowed to have their own meetup groups but not whites?  </p>
<p><i>Joel Goldfoot, a San Francisco professional, was one &ldquo;highly offended&rdquo; user who immediately jumped on the group&rsquo;s purpose &mdash; and he wasn&rsquo;t the only one. Shortly after the group&rsquo;s creation, site users fired off comments, calling this all-white meetup inflammatory and, well, racist.</i></p>
<p>It is not &#8220;inflammatory&#8221;, &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;offensive.&#8221;  It is discrimination. It is injustice.  And it is against whites and only whites.</p>
