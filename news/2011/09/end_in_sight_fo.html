<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With the selection of four candidates for the position of vice provost for diversity and multicultural affairs, the University has moved one step closer to addressing its diversity woes.</p>
<p>Of the 54 heads of departments and centers in the College and Arts and Sciences, only five are minorities, an issue interim Associate Provost for Diversity and Multicultural Affairs Terri Houston said requires action.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Whoever is chosen will become a member of the provost&rsquo;s cabinet, meeting weekly with Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Bruce Carney.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The finalists all come from similar professional backgrounds, each having been head of a diversity program at a major university.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Paul Godley, chairman of the search committee, encouraged the community to discuss diversity with the finalists in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have outstanding candidates,&#8221; Godley said. &#8220;People need to come and see for themselves what they are about.&#8221;</p>

						<p><em><small>Daniel Wiser, Daily Tar Heel, September 29, 2011</small></em></p>
<p>Plans to offer buyout packages to tenured faculty have been discussed as a viable option to cut costs and find savings at universities in the state.</p>
<p>But UNC-system administrators say there&rsquo;s no money  &mdash;  even for a program to save money.</p>
<p>In preparation for state funding cuts earlier this year, administrators considered using the buyout option to lure tenured faculty into retiring early.</p>
<p>Universities ended up absorbing a cut of 15.6 percent, or $414 million, in funding from the state. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Michael Green, faculty president at UNC-Charlotte, said faculty members approached the school&rsquo;s chancellor at the start of the fall semester about potential buyout plans. But the school&rsquo;s budget would not sustain the buyouts, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Universities in the state have also struggled to keep the faculty they currently have in place.</p>
<p>The UNC system retained only 37 percent of faculty who received job offers from other universities last year, a concern for the academic quality of institutions, said Phil Dixon, chairman of the Board of Governors&rsquo; personnel and tenure committee.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve lost the war.  When the trustees of UNC don&rsquo;t immediately call an emergency meeting and interrogate the race hustler Terri Houston, you know we&rsquo;ve lost the war.</p>
<p><br>
They aren&rsquo;t asking her, &#8220;Ms. Houston, which of our White heads of departments do you want us to fire so that we can hire your preferred variety of diversity in their place? If Eve Carson had not been killed by two young African Americans and had graduated from UNC, and eventually become a department head here, would her Whiteness &#8216;require action&rsquo; from the Office of Diversity and Multicultural Affairs?  Didn&rsquo;t it already get the &#8216;required action&rsquo; enough from the community of color, so much so that she was eternally divested of her White privilege, as were her White parents divested of their White daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Until Whites start forcing blacks to outright proclaim the final ends of their &#8220;requires action,&#8221; we won&rsquo;t do anything to awaken White Humanity in our time of crisis.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t.  We&rsquo;ve lost already.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed that Mark Lloyd hasn&rsquo;t yet put his Diversity Curse in action and demanded that Chris Matthews &#8220;step down&#8221; so that the CBC can have his time slot on MSNBC, right before Al Sharpie jive jive jive.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Rules for Whiteness, lovingly offered in memory of Savitri Devi on the anniversary of her blessed birth:</p>
<p>Read White Man, Thing Again!, by Anthony Jacob</p>
<p>Avoid eye contact with the hostile and dangerously anti-white Diversity</p>
<p>Pledge to the ancestral beauty of the Whiteness within you to never again donate money to any organization or group that fosters Diversity and helps minorities.</p>
<p>Seek out your neighbors who are afraid to speak their honest feelings about how apprehensive they are for the future and give them gentle and safe opportunities to voice their latent Race Realism.</p>
<p>Build conscious White Community in your community that happens to be White.</p>
<p>Celebrate the poetic joy that those Whiteys who will be passed over for future department heads at ultra liberal UNC must all have proclaimed their passion for &#8220;embracing diversity and inclusion by celebrating diversity and welcoming differences&#8221; as a job requirement.  </p>

		<p>My blood pressure rises at this, but most of America just shrugs and says &#8220;so what?&#8221; And really, I understand the indifference, because this placing of integration above all other priorities has gone on so long that most folks have become completely complacent. In the public schools in my town, racial integration is clearly the top priority. School officials fall all over themselves trying to placate loud demanding blacks, with free lunches and special tutoring and free after school programs (open to those who live in Section 8), but no one seems to care about preparing the really talented students for college. UNC apparently has similar priorities. </p>

		<p>Thank goodness universities are having their funding cut.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who has two degrees I can confirm that the universities have become propaganda centres for anti White, anti Western leftism.</p>
<p>I can also confirm that the single diversity not valued in universities is intellectual diversity.</p>

		<p>&#8220;School can&rsquo;t afford to buy out tenured faculty, but it can afford diversity!&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s due to intense PC brainwashing that has been going on for years, until the concept has reached a point where it is now a cult or sect.  </p>
<p>Its advocates are as thoroughly brainwashed into believing its perverted tenants as any member of the Jonestown cult involved in mass suicide, wherein they drank poisoned kool aid, because they were ordered to do so by their programmer. </p>
<p>I have no doubt that the choice to drop PC tenants are very nearly on a par with accepting death among these people.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see how far they&rsquo;re willing to go to hold on to their programmed belief system as the economy continues its drop to the bottom and fewer and fewer funds will be available for personnel, nonsensical courses, programs and policies. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting to see if any of these rabid ideologues wind up pouring gas on themselves and striking a match in protest. </p>

		<p>I wonder if those younger, non tenured WHITE instructors/teachers or what ever they call themselves at this time, that support the bleeding heart multicultural philosophy will feel the same way about it when they are replaced by blacks, Indians (red dot Indians) or illegal aliens and they CAN be replaced easily if they are not tenured or otherwise contracted. They will then realize even though all the blacks and browns in the world are employed that will NOT pay his/her bills.</p>

<p><i>Thank goodness universities are having their funding cut.</i></p>
<p>Sure, but they just pass the cuts on as tuition hikes:</p>
<p><i>This year, tuition at UC schools jumped 32 percent. Next fall, it will increase another 8 percent. The &#8220;smaller&#8221; amount raises tuition by $800 per year. UC&rsquo;s Lynn Tierney said the university system relies on state funding, which has been drastically cut over the last few years.</i>  (quotes mine).</p>
<p>And, they weren&rsquo;t done yet.  This year, 2011:</p>
<p><i>University of California regents voted Thursday to raise tuition by 9.6 percent - on top of an 8 percent increase already approved for this fall</i></p>
<p>Remember when I posted this:</p>
<p><i>College tuition has risen 900% since 1978</i></p>

<p>FYI, &#8220;Red Dot Indians&#8221; are highly qualified and in many cases even better than their white counterparts as academic heads. I don&rsquo;t understand how you loop them with blacks &amp; Hispanics. Those Indians  are chosen on the basis of merit based on their sheer intelligence &amp; skills unlike AA hires.

<p>I apologize on behalf of some whites here who inaccurately loop Indians ( Asians) with Africans &amp; Mestizos. Personally, Indians are quite intelligent, talented &amp; articulate. I would go as far as stating the obvious - that upper caste Indians are some of the smartest people on the planet. However, there is a general consensus that many Indians do take away white collar professional jobs in the fields of medicine, business &amp; technology from white Americans who founded the United States. So as long as Indians reside here, expect more of that resentement. Also, on a sidenote many Indians like Jews &amp; Chinese immigrants tend to be involved in financial scams &amp; fraud. Considering the ailing economy that does not bode well with us. I hope I&rsquo;ve made it clear! </p>

<p>That is because it is impossible for whites to secure college or university teaching positions now.  Indians hire their own once they&rsquo;re in, and as long as they&rsquo;re not hiring whites, no one cares.</p>
<p>Answer this, humor us:  Why do you need to come to this country?  Why can&rsquo;t you stay in your own?  You have stolen or been handed enough white technology so there is no reason for you to come here unless you are escaping the cesspits that your very own people created.  I do not want the US turned into India.  This is a white-founded country for whites and their posterity.</p>
<p>Many of you continue to look down on us native born American whites as inferior to you but we did very well for generations without Red Dot Indians, in fact we &#8220;somehow&#8221; put a man on the moon. It is not our fault that you cannot build or maintain first world countries.</p>
<p>We founded and built this country.  You did not. You are displacing us whites and that is what we resent.  </p>
<p>I wonder what the Indian government would do if massive numbers of whites tried to settle in India.<br>

<p>What &#8220;white technology&#8221; ? Please! Granted that for the past 650 ears the western world has dominated the scene. But without the cardinal cognizance of Mathematics ( numerals, decimals,fractions, algebra, fluxions, trigonometery etc&hellip;.and the numerous other scientific treasures from India, China, Mesopotamia &amp; Egypt&hellip;.later on passed thru&rsquo; the Arab traders to Europe&hellip;.where would this &#8220;white technology&#8221; be? Nowhere! </p>
<p>Also, Indians have made rather significant contributions to American Science and have earned ever right to enjoy the fruits of their genius and endevours. From, designing the EMPGEN robotic space vehicle to successfully land in Mars ( Dr Kanna Rajan of Texas Tech who worked in NASA for the Mars Rover mission 2003), Invention of the Pentium Chip vital for the life of almost all modern computers/laptops ( Vinod Dham - &#8220;Father of the Pentium&#8221;), Pioneering of Fibre Optic tech. ( Dr Narender Kipany - &#8220;father of Fibre Optics&#8221;), WiMax/Wifi/MIMO which runs our multimedia tech - Dr Arockiaswamy Paulraj) to the pioneering of HDTV ( former Bell Labs President Dr Arun Netravali) and the current Federal officer chief of the National Science Foundation ( which sanctions America&rsquo;s scientific progress) and the Federal officer Chief of Technology of the United States of America - Aneesh Chopra and ofcourse I could go on &amp; on about the numerous inventions/contributions in Medicine, Hi-Tech etc. But, I&rsquo;ll leave it with that. </p>
<p>We have earned our place&hellip;..the reason it&rsquo;s almost impossible to repect the present &amp; future generation of white Americans is because the are for the most part incredibly lazy, un-intellectual and incompetent as compared to Asians ( Indians, Chinese etc) &amp; Jews. Ofcourse blacks &amp; Hispanics are much more worse than their white counterparts. Having said that, I do know some extremely intelligent whites who are conservative, rational &amp; simply awesome. I happen to be good friends with them &amp; DO respect them.</p>
<p> Respect has to be earned, its NOT a right. Since most of this generation is obssessed with TV, alcohol,football,Facebook &amp; showing off their ability to type fast on their mobile phone texts displaying sheer stupidity &amp; chasing women ( white traits) as opposed to pursuing intellectual interests as a young Indian here&hellip;.I cannot have much respect for them. The only people I seem to admire &amp; respect as friends are the high IQ white Askhanaz American Jews &amp; our fellow Asian friends.</p>

		<p>You did not answer the questions I posed to you so I&rsquo;ll ask again:</p>
<p>Why do you need to come to this country if you are so superior to us Whites?</p>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t you stay in your own country? Do you believe this country was &#8220;just here&#8221; for the taking?  Maybe it all just appeared out of thin air.  Or maybe the Native Americans created this First World culture and we whites just stole it from them?</p>
<p><i>We have earned our place&hellip;..the reason it&rsquo;s almost impossible to repect the present &amp; future generation of white Americans is because the are for the most part incredibly lazy, un-intellectual and incompetent as compared to Asians.</i></p>
<p>You Indian and any other Asian supremacists have a lot of nerve coming on a site about white issues to mock and demean us.  It is not the fault of whites that you cannot create a livable country for yourselves.</p>
<p>And, you are wrong about &#8220;a right to be here.&#8221;   You have no right to a country created and founded by whites for whites and only whites.  It is not the fault of whites that your own people created a country that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://goo.gl/n7BV4" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/n7BV4</a></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t throw our dead into the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers, as is commonly done in the Ganges River:</p>
<p>You are playing the role of useful idiot and aren&rsquo;t even aware of it. You are only here because there is a worldwide war on whites being conducted by a hostile elite that wishes white destruction and elimination.  Whites are being displaced and destroyed in SA, Australia, the United States and Europe.   Your role  is to dilute the white population of the United States, steal our jobs and living space and tell us how &#8220;inferior&#8221; we are to you.   And yes, we whites have played a role in our own destruction, but we were not the architects.  It is not us that denies our right to promote ourselves.  But,  we are waking up.</p>
<p>No modern technology would be possible without the legal, economic and financial systems developed by whites and only whites.  Economics follows law. No Indian or Asian country developed cultures marked by rationalism, self-criticism, the search for truth, the rule of law and equality under the law, freedom of thought and expression, human rights, and the rights of the individual. These things mark Western Civilization, created by whites and only whites and allowed our people create the freest, most prosperous civilizations that have ever existed on the face of the earth.   That is why you are here; to piggyback on what we whites have created.</p>
<p>As for &#8220;superior&#8221; Indian intelligence:</p>
<p>The following is from Tim Stefanini, the principal and founder of Velocitos Corporation. He has over 20 years experience working in the software industry and has been the CTO, Vice President, or Director of five companies in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p><i>In truth, these are not the best and brightest workers. In many cases involving Indian H-1B holders, they have fake degrees and some have only taken a two-week computer class.</i></p>
<p><i>Government officials in the Indian town of Bihar recently found 100,000 fake Indian degree certificates. Worse, even legitimate diplomas are useless since the typical Indian degree is from a three-year institution, not four years as required by H-1B standards.</i> </p>
<p><i>The list of failed companies and projects associated with these frauds is huge.</i></p>

<p><i>What &ldquo;white technology&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>I would ask the same of you &#8220;What Indian or Asian technology?&#8221; (that wasn&rsquo;t STOLEN from whites).</p>
<p>You can thank whites for the following, which is a partial list of white discoveries and creations:</p>
<p>Computers and the software that drives them, the Internet, the bulk of mathematics, physics and chemistry, 95% of all medical advances and life-saving pharmaceuticals including antibiotics; the internal combustion and jet engines, satellites, rocketry and spacecraft, microscopes, recorded music, television, radios and cameras. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s your <b>WHITE TECHNOLOGY</b>. </p>
<p>How about you stop using it?</p>
<p>Have you also noticed that we are communicating in my white language, the English language?  The language of science and technology?  Not any Indian or other Asian language.  Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>Anyone who tells you we whites &#8220;need&#8221; your &#8220;brilliance&#8221; and &#8220;intelligence&#8221; is a liar.</p>
<p>And a damned one at that.<br>

<p>Really.  Maybe it&rsquo;s not common, but a dead body washing up on the banks is occasional news around here.   About half the time, the dearly deceased was from the ghetto.</p>

<p>Have you ever traveled to India? I have traveled through the Indian sub-continent and the level of pollution and fecal matter deposited everywhere is staggering.  I have seen nothing of the sort in the US.</p>
<p>An occasional body washing up on an American river bank is a far cry from the hundreds of half burned dead bodies and female fetuses that are regularly thrown by Indians into the Ganges river.</p>
<p>So many dead bodies are thrown into the Ganges, including the police dumping scores of unclaimed bodies, that tens of thousands of snapping turtles were released in the hopes that they would eat the corpses.  </p>
<p><i>As we reached the sandbar, just downstream from a Hindu cremation ground, we&rsquo;re hit by a putrid smell and a ghastly sight: lying on the sand are a human rib cage, a femur, and, nearby, a yellow-shrouded corpse. &#8220;It&rsquo;s been rotting there for a month,&#8221; a fisherman tells us. The clothed body of a small child floats a few yards off the island.</i></p>
<p>This is the same river where Indians bathe, swim, brush their teeth, wash their faces and draw their drinking water, exposing themselves to fecal microorganisms responsible for typhoid, cholera and amoebic dysentery from the 10 to 12 million gallons of untreated raw sewage that is poured directly into the river each day. Some stretches have a fecal bacterial counts nearly 4,000 times the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s bathing standard limit.</p>
<p>If we import enough Indians they will bring these lovely practices with them and bodies WILL start to wash up regularly on the banks of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.  Maybe you don&rsquo;t see this as a problem.  Really.</p>

		<p><i>it&rsquo;s almost impossible to repect the present &amp; future generation of white Americans is because the are for the most part incredibly lazy, un-intellectual and incompetent as compared to Asians ( Indians, Chinese etc) &amp; Jews.</i></p>
<p><i>Since most of this generation is obssessed with TV, alcohol,football,Facebook &amp; showing off their ability to type fast on their mobile phone texts displaying sheer stupidity &amp; chasing women ( white traits) as opposed to pursuing intellectual interests as a young Indian here</i></p>
<p>Profound.</p>
<p>You have written an extremely important message and I must thank AR again for posting so many comments such as yours from Indians and other Asians who are vastly superior to us Whites.  Someone needs to set us Whites straight before anyone gets the wrong impression about us.  From reading the comments on this site, one might think that it is Whites that landed a man on the moon and not Indians and Chinese.  </p>
<p>Respect has to be earned and we deceitful Whites have in no way earned it.  We do not have the right to go around saying we creating anything considering that it is common knowledge as to how stupid and lazy we are.  Everything we have and lay claim to has been stolen from Indians and Chinese including the entire United States.</p>
<p>You need to keep posting here and reminding us that we did NOT invent jet engines, computers, software, satellites or 95% of all medical breakthroughs.  It can be easily proved that those creations came out of China and India and Whites who claim otherwise are liars and fools and easily can be easily disproved (hint:  can you please provide the proof, I couldn&rsquo;t find any after an extensive Google search).</p>
<p>Without you reminding us constantly as to how stupid we are, one might get the impression that it is Whites who created the modern world and not Indians and Asians.  As the AR banner boldly proclaims:  There is not a truth existing which I fear!</p>
<p>We must put to rest once and for all the hateful, racist lies Whites continue to spew about who built what and show once and for all that it is Chinese and Indians who build superior civilizations, not lazy Whites.</p>
<p>All one has to do is take one look at the countries the Chinese and Indians have built for themselves as compared to the filthy, polluted, crime and disease-ridden hell holes Whites live in such as the US, Australia and Europe.  I can&rsquo;t imagine ANYONE wanting to live in those foul countries and it is no wonder Whites are fleeing and demanding entry to China and India.  Those countries are right to keep out the hoards of Whites that are trying to break down the borders   &mdash;   who in the hell do they think they are?  Why can&rsquo;t they stay in their own countries and clean up their own messes!</p>
<p>Thanks for showing us the truth of the matter. </p>
