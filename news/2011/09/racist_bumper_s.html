			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chelsi Moy, Missoulian, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students on Monday discovered a white supremacy bumper sticker stuck to the door of the University of Montana&rsquo;s Payne Family Native American Center.</p>
<p>A week and a half earlier, a student discovered discriminatory messages stuffed into books in the African-American section of the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Library.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The sticker read &#8220;Save the White Race! Earth&rsquo;s Most Endangered Species&#8221; and was posted on the doors of the recycling center of the Native American building. {snip}</p>
<p>The bumper sticker included the online address of Montana Creators, &#8220;a pro-white organization that is dedicated to the survival, expansion and advancement of the White race  &mdash;  and it alone,&#8221; according to the group&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no evidence linking the two acts of discrimination, and the police said it&rsquo;s hard to know who actually posted the sticker and whether that group had anything to do with the incident. {snip}</p>
<p>Several Native students came into American Indian Student Services on Monday upset by what they saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;When things like this happen, it deflates the students,&#8221; said Fredricka Hunter, director of American Indian Student Services. &#8220;I think students are hoping something will happen. There&rsquo;s a no-tolerance policy on campus.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The person or people responsible for the acts could face criminal and university penalties, said Lucy France, director of the Equal Opportunities and Affirmative Action office.</p>

		<p>What would Jesus do?  Obviously, he would want White college girls to sign the purity pledge that says &#8220;Making white babies is a hate crime against global dignity&#8221;.</p>
<p>Even the 700 Club is gushing about the dolphin story.  Whites are played by a black, and it is called &#8220;Americans love a story of redemption, just like the loved the Blind Side, another great story of redemption.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we can&rsquo;t go to church.  We are told that redemption comes through blacks.  We won&rsquo;t worship a pagan god that wants White girls to be destroyed by Africanism.</p>

Is this a joke? There is actually an Equal Opportunities and Affirmative Action Office? This has to be the biggest oxymoron phrase I&rsquo;ve ever seen. If it wasn&rsquo;t so sad, it would be the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve read in a while.</p>

		<p>And here is where the Leftists inadvertently tip their hands. Pay attention. They become disheartened, &#8220;deflated&#8221; at the idea of whites not dominating them, but of even continuing to &#8220;exist or survive&#8221; which is what the bumper sticker espouses. There can be no fence-sitting in this kind of ideological war. Either you embrace your own destruction or you&rsquo;re racist.</p>

		<p>Gee, a sticker and some flyers.  Criminal acts?  What happened to the first amendment.</p>
<p>Discrimination?  How is a plea to save the white race discrimination?  If the flyer pled to save Native Americans, would it be discriminatory?  </p>

		<p>Why do the white taxpayers of Montana put up with this. Does this government funded university have a White Culture Center and a White section in its library? A special student services department for whites? Nahh!! You see, that would be very, very &#8220;rayciss.&#8221; Fredricka Hunter sure is right when she said there&rsquo;s a &#8220;no tollerance policy&#8221; at U of MT. There&rsquo;s no tollerance for any kind of opinion or belief that differs even slightly from the extreme left wing of the political spectrum. </p>

		<p>The irony and hypocrisy of this kind of stuff never seems to occur to the PC Nazi&rsquo;s. Who do the American Indian students bring their concerns to because some white person is advocating on behalf of whites? Well, to the American Indian Student Services of course. I&rsquo;m guessing there is no such thing as White American Student Services at this school. And this knucklehead who runs the supposed &#8220;equal opportunity&#8221; office is running around talking about criminal charges for what, someone exercising their 1st amendment rights? And of course, how do we know this isn&rsquo;t a hoax, something the leftwing race-baiting haters are experts at.</p>

<p>What sort of &#8220;criminal penalties?&#8221;  Unlawful sticker placement?  Why do &#8220;native Americans&#8221; have their own building?  These silly libs are so deluded.  This &#8220;Montana college&#8221; should join the ever growing list of so called &#8220;places of higher learning&#8221; that should be turned into a parking lot.  </p>

		<p>Those poor, abused native Americans. They have to put up with evil, blood thirsty stuff like bumper stickers being stuck to their doors. How will they ever survive in such an intolerant, racist environment? And a bumper sticker that was pro white no less. Now that&rsquo;s just down right disgusting!</p>
<p>I hope that the police and university work in league to capture these dangerous, vile, heartless thugs before they wreak more havoc on an otherwise peaceful and tolerant university. </p>

		<p>According to the story these are &#8220;two acts of discrimination&#8221; that warrant police intervention.</p>
<p>If this story doesn&rsquo;t turn one into a raving white nationalist I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p>
<p>It would have been more effective, for the cause of diversity, if this story had not included the offending statement itself &#8216;save the white race&rsquo;. Often times these story never include the actual specifics, only that &#8216;racist statements&rsquo; were made. </p>

		<p>Everything else aside for a moment, even that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with any of it, there&rsquo;s no proof a white did it. When you look at who actually benefits from &#8220;expressions&#8221; like these, it&rsquo;s not whites. It&rsquo;s not at all curious to me that there is universal silence in the public &#8220;conversation&#8221; that follows surrounding what&rsquo;s plainly obvious: That minorities stand to gain far more from these types of displays than whites do (This is the part where the detective says &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the motive?&#8221;, still fairly routine in police work). That&rsquo;s the question they won&rsquo;t ask. Who does it empower?  Because they don&rsquo;t want to know the answer! It&rsquo;s equally likely, if not more so considering the leftist climates common at U.S. colleges, that a white *didn&rsquo;t* do this.  It&rsquo;s also not curious to me why an officer of the fascist Equal Opportunities and Affirmative Action office would not for one second consider this as a possibility and wold proceed with the immediately assumption that a white was responsible. It&rsquo;s disgusting!</p>

<p>I looked up the U of Montana on FIRE to find out if there are speech codes and thought police on campus, and sure enough there are: </p>
<p><b>Free Speech Zones</b></p>
<p>Student Guide to Event Planning in the UC: Free Speech Area 10-11</p>
<p><i>The University has set aside the Library Mall as a free speech zone, where speakers are permitted to speak to the public on any subject of interest to them.  Use of the space is subject to reasonable limitations regarding time of day, place and manner of speaking.</i></p>
<p>Straight to the gulag for those caught practicing Free Speech outside of The Zone!!</p>
<p>Yet, as usual, UM hypocritically advertises itself as committed to Free Speech:</p>
<p><i>The University of Montana recognizes that its students retain the rights provided by the United States and Montana Constitutions, Federal and State statutes, and other applicable University policy, while attending the University</i></p>
<p>Free Speech is only what WE Kommissars at MU say it is!!  The US Constitution is only how WE Kommissars construe it!!  The Constitution is, after all, a living document open to many different interpretations AND, more importantly, the product of dead White slavers, rendering it irrelevant!!</p>
<p>IOW, if you choose to attend or visit MU, watch your back at all times!!  Big Brother IS alive and listening to (and probably recording) every word you say   &mdash;   in or out of the &#8220;Free Speech Zone.&#8221;</p>

But you think any White org. has no right to exist because they are Whites for Whites? Because they don&rsquo;t want to live in their own country among nonwhites who are taking our jobs, money, and women?  Because they SEE what evil has happened to the country their Founders envisioned?  Because they may want their own homeland as was the intent of forming America in the first place?  </p>
<p> Please give us your expertise on what racist really means? I already know I will most certainly disagree with your definition. </p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with every word you said. 99% of the time these hoaxes are committed by the very people who claim to be &#8220;offended&#8221; and are the victim.

		<p>I&rsquo;m betting it&rsquo;s another attention seeking hoax, as nearly 99.99% of these things are on college campuses.  The blacks themselves probably stuffed the notes in their books, and some NA probably put the sticker on the building.  How many times have blacks and minorities been found to have committed the heinous act after an investigation?<br>
Nearly all of them have pointed right back to the one &#8220;targeted&#8221; and &#8220;offended&#8221; as having been done by himself.<br>

		<p>Indeed, to try to prosecute this would be an egregious slap in the face of the First Amendment.  And I want to address the term, &#8220;racist&#8221;.  Although I don&rsquo;t consider this word to be ugly anymore mostly due to its overuse, I have a question.  What exactly is so wrong with being racist?  Well, there are plenty of laws against acting out in a racist way (at least for whites) but I will be damned if anyone should tell anyone how to THINK.  I, for one, don&rsquo;t consider myself racist but I sure as hell can be bigoted from time to time and definitely discriminating and prejudiced.  So what?  I want these anti-white bigots to look up the definition of each of these words in the dictionary.  Aren&rsquo;t they demonstrating exactly what they accuse whites of doing?  And since they are, again, so what?  We should, as human beings, all be free to think and say any darn thing we want.  Acting out on it by physically harming anyone or inhibiting their right to pursue happiness (and economic freedom  &mdash;  brought about by their OWN labor) is wrong.  Saying and writing down what you THINK is RIGHT and is the very definition of freedom.  All that said, if these people plan to prosecute, hopefully it will make the MSM news and will lead to more awareness.  Take it to the Supreme Court!  Then we will all see where whites stand in this country, won&rsquo;t we?</p>
