<h1>Sexually Transmitted Disease: How to Fight Frighteningly High Rates of Infection</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Los Angeles Times, September 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chlamydia rates among young African American women in L.A. County have reached alarming levels:  8.7% of all black teenagers ages 15 to 19 have the sexually transmitted disease. Gonorrhea rates are lower but still troublingly high among African American girls and women. Rates among Latino girls and women also are above average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Chlamydia is easily curable with antibiotics, but if it is allowed to spread undetected, it can cause a host of potentially dangerous health problems, especially to the fetus of a pregnant woman. {snip}</p>
<p>The county&rsquo;s well-regarded &#8220;I Know&#8221; campaign is one smart approach. It provides free home testing kits to women, who can mail in their tests and receive the results by Internet. But not everyone has Internet access. So on Monday, the county and Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas are kicking it up a notch by placing dedicated kiosks throughout his district that will allow women to order the kits online and get the results as well.</p>

		<p>Articles like this leave me wondering: are venereal diseases racist? Or are they a social construct?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that the smaller percentages of Whites and &#8216;others&rsquo; on the chart are made up predominantly of women that have sex with blacks. </p>

 Very simple. As the accompanying chart clearly shows, your first and best line of defense is NOT to have sex with a black person. Just one MORE reason, and a very good one at that, to avoid blacks.</p>

<p>That is one suspicion I have too. Unfortunately we have no way of knowing for sure (although logical assuming we do). </p>
<p>If they only reported from which group a said individual contracted the disease from (and the rates of contraction between difference population groups with this graph and statistics).</p>

<p>Interesting point. And one wonders why so many young people under the age of consent are having sex. Where are their parents? Or is it &#8220;parent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, do I detect an inverse correlation between median IQ and rates of STDs? </p>

		<p>I wonder what the rates for gays are?   And please don&rsquo;t call me, &#8220;homophobic&#8221; or any other such nonsense, I&rsquo;m most unequivocally not.  People of all groups need to take responsability for their actions, because these actions have consequences.  I guess such a concept is considered radical these days.   However, those that suffer most by ignoring it are those that the radical left claims to care about.  Pathetic.</p>

		<p>This has been the case for hundreds of years.  Blacks begin sex at a younger age, on the average, and have more promiscuous, unprotected sex.  Then they don&rsquo;t seek treatment as promptly as whites do.  Much of the teen cases are probably diagnosed during pregnancy exams.</p>

<p>A fair question. I have no studies or facts to draw upon, but my first thought would be that STD&rsquo;s among gay groups would most likely also show a similar pattern based on race. </p>

		<p>These acts of personal irresponsibility are emblematic.  The dependent class has gotten to the point where it can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t take care of their own personal hygiene even when the consequences are dire.  Similar charts for the distribution by race/ethnicity exist for HIV/AIDS.  <br>
These voluntary behavioral group differences have implications for policy.  STDs are a matter of intimate behavior with a person of one&rsquo;s choosing, and are outside many of society&rsquo;s influences. Thus the claims of institutional racism don&rsquo;t apply.  <br>
There are 4 factors for the disparate incidences of chlamydia between cohorts; per capita frequency of sex, sex with multiple partners, unprotected sex, and not getting it treated (treatment is free in most community hospitals).   A fifth, education, I assume is essentially the same among all groups.  The disparity is without racism, the graph is quite telling.<br>

		<p>Take a good look at that chart. Study it carefully. Blacks are in a class by themselves when it comes to STD&rsquo;s. All the other groups added together are lower then the black figure. It is not a difference of degree. It is a difference in kind.</p>

Is the immediate issue more IQ than race  &mdash;  with due respect that an attribute of IQ is time-preference / the insight level that facilitates balancing pleasures with likely consequences?  What&rsquo;s happening in &#8220;our&#8221; sexual hedonistic utopia on the LEFT  half of White Bell Curve MAY BE  not all that different from  some of the observations here about Blacks?  If so, it&rsquo;s an irony of our time that leftists on campus are promulgating standards of self indulgence that are devastating to those less fortunate than<br>
themselves.       <br>

		<p>The Roosevelt administration&rsquo;s syphilis research originally did not intend to focus on blacks.  It was black doctors and nurses at Tuskegee Institute who lobbied Eleanor Roosevelt to set up one of the many syphilis research studies at Tuskegee.  The Tuskegee doctors and nurses lobbied on the grounds that blacks had a syphilis rate 5 times higher than Whites.</p>
<p>This was in the early 1930&rsquo;s.<br>

		<p>I am white.  When I was 17 in 1973, a white older man who was my mentor on the weekends, proclaimed that sex with a black woman would be an excellent sexual, wonderful, erotic experience.</p>
<p>Even then, I just did not find black women attractive.  I still do not find black women attractive.  Even if sexually tranmitted diseases did not exist, I still would not want sex with a black woman.</p>
<p>And yet there is a saying that goes &#8220;Once you try black, you&rsquo;ll never go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, where I live in Philadelphia, if I did date black women, there is a high risk that racist angry blacks would attack me screaming &#8220;Hey whitey, don&rsquo;t mess with our women!&#8221;</p>

<p>Officials, churches join fight against sexual diseases<br>
Unusual partnership targets chlamydia and gonorrhea in Los Angeles County, which has one of the highest rates in the nation, especially in Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas&rsquo; district.<br>
 <br>
A home-testing kit for sexually transmitted diseases is seen at a news conference Monday to announce a Los Angeles County program to provide young women in South Los Angeles with these kits. Los Angeles County has the highest number of chlamydia cases and the second-highest number of gonorrhea cases in the country. (Reed Saxon / Associated Press / September 19, 2011)</p>

 Opinion: STDs: How to fight frighteningly high rates of infection <br>
By Anna Gorman, Los Angeles Times<br>
 <br>
September 20, 2011<br>
Moving to combat rising rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia among young black women in South Los Angeles, county officials launched a new education and testing campaign Monday with some unlikely partners: churches.</p>
<p>Pastors and &#8220;first ladies&#8221; from churches throughout the region are joining an effort to raise awareness of the sexually transmitted diseases and publicize a home testing program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody wants to talk about it,&#8221; said Debra Williams, whose husband is the pastor at McCoy Memorial Baptist Church. &#8220;We need to change that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign, led by Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and Department of Public Health Director Dr. Jonathan Fielding, will increase access to free tests and information through three touch-screen computer kiosks and a mobile health van. Health officials also plan to expand patient follow-up at clinics and prevention education at schools.</p>
<p>Officials announced details of the program to school officials, church leaders, public health workers and reporters Monday at the new King Center for Public Health in Willowbrook.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County ranks first in the nation for the numbers of chlamydia cases and second for gonorrhea cases, according to a 2009 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Last year, more than 45,400 chlamydia cases and 10,400 gonorrhea cases were reported in Los Angeles County, according to the county Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>The number of residents with both diseases is disproportionately higher in the 2nd Supervisorial District, which includes South Los Angeles and two dozen other communities, according to the county Department of Public Health. The rates are also much higher for black females ages 15 to 24 than any other population, according to the department.</p>
<p>The diseases, which can cause infertility and dangerous pregnancy complications, are often detected late because many of those affected don&rsquo;t have recognizable symptoms. The CDC recommends yearly screening for sexually active women ages 25 and younger.</p>
<p>Women will be able to order home testing kits online or through kiosks to be placed initially in pharmacies in the 2nd Supervisorial District and added later at community centers and schools. Peer counselors and outreach workers also will have hand-held tablets and be able to register women for the tests and distribute them on the spot. The test takes less than a minute and women can get their results by logging onto the website or calling a toll-free number.</p>
<p>Ridley-Thomas said local data on the diseases is alarming and the involvement of the churches is &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is probably the first time you have pastors and first ladies coming forward to address an issue that heretofore has been considered taboo,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Here is a little something about black pathology.  Note how few black men meet the absolute minimum criteria for even 1 date let alone marriage.</p>
<p>Black media outlet: Only 3 good black men for every 100 black women.</p>
<p>Finding a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; black man for a black woman to date is &ldquo;extremely slim.&rdquo; Only 3 out of 100 black men meet the most basic requirements.</p>
<p>They define &ldquo;good&rdquo; as:</p>
<p>High School Diploma, employed with a modest income, </p>
<p>has never been to jail or prison, </p>
<p>no illegitimate kids, </p>
<p>not aggressively pursuing white women. </p>
<p>(The percentage of successful black men who aggressively pursue white women and shun black women has become very scandalous and a major source of tension in the black media.)</p>
