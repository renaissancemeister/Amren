<p>Jeffrey Anderson, Washington Times, August 30, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>D.C. Attorney General Irvin B. Nathan filed a false-claims complaint Tuesday against the nonprofit group Miracle Hands and its director, reformed gangster Cornell Jones, charging them with misappropriating more than $300,000 from the city&rsquo;s HIV/AIDS program for renovations on a proposed job training center that instead was used to open a strip club.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in D.C. Superior Court, seeks $1 million in damages and accuses Mr. Jones and Miracle Hands of unjust enrichment and submitting false expenditure reports in violation of the District&rsquo;s False Claims Act. It states that Mr. Jones improperly received $329,000 in city funds for renovations at a warehouse in Northeast that now houses the Stadium Club, which advertises &#8220;Five Star Dining and a Premier Gentleman&rsquo;s Club Experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funds, which originated from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and were distributed by the District&rsquo;s HIV/AIDS Administration, required that the warehouse be converted into a job-training facility for people with HIV/AIDS, according to the attorney general&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Yet the conversion did not occur and the job-training facility has never opened, the complaint says.</p>
<p>City financial records show that Miracle Hands received more than $5.8 million in D.C. funds from 2000 through February.</p>
<p>In January, The Washington Times reported that the Stadium Club operates with a liquor license reserved in 2007 for a blighted warehouse property at 2127 Queens Chapel Road, which Mr. Jones owned at the time and used as the Miracle Hands office. By 2009, he had leased the property to a pair of businessmen who were in the process of purchasing the liquor license and planning to open a strip club there.</p>
<p>In 2010, Mr. Jones, a convicted drug trafficker immortalized in the Black Entertainment Television series &#8220;American Gangster,&#8221; sold the property for $2.7 million, according to D.C. property records. The Stadium Club opened at 2127 Queens Chapel Road in March 2010.</p>
