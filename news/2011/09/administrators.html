<h1>Administrators Sue VVUHSD</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Natasha Lindstrom, VV Daily Press, September 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five white male administrators who were demoted or allegedly forced to resign are suing the Victor Valley Union High School District for race and sex discrimination.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges three black women in a bloc on the district&rsquo;s Board of Trustees &#8220;have developed an agenda to achieve what they characterize as &#8216;equity&rsquo; to remove Caucasian administrators from the district,&#8221; according to a complaint filed Sept. 7 in Victorville Superior Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the spring, the district notified several administrators they were being demoted or involuntarily transferred, stirring tension among both employees and parents questioning the moves.</p>
<p>The complaint states that administrators were demoted in spite of stellar performance evaluations. The plaintiffs say they believe the board majority wanted to increase the number of black administrators and wanted &#8220;more equity in discipline for minority employees and minority students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is truly shocking that in 2011, a group of publicly elected officials can publicly espouse a blatantly discriminatory agenda on the basis of race and sex, and implement that agenda,&#8221; the complaint states. &#8220;This outrageous conduct cannot, and must not, be tolerated.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The complaint alleges black female administrators with less experience were left alone, and that white administrators were replaced with black administrators with fewer qualifications.</p>
<p>The complaint paints a picture of the reverse discrimination emerging when a new board majority took over after the November 2010 election, comprised of new members Duneen De Bruhl and Evelyn Glasper and returning member Barbara Dew. The complaint states the three black women are personal friends, attend the same church and &#8220;regularly discuss district business together.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;reverse discrimination&#8221; sickens me. It tries to validate and minimize their discrimination as a form of retaliation. </p>
<p>If you apply this to other stories the absurdity becomes apparent. </p>

		<p>Why are Whites who stand up against the Diversity Curse so rare?  The fear we all suffer at the thought of taking a stand for our own survival is astounding.  We are truly a tyrannized race in our own racial homeland.  This shall not stand!</p>
<p>Why haven&rsquo;t the Whiteys at UGA all filed a petition with a judge to put a halt on UGA&rsquo;s new Embrace Diversity and Inclusion plan, which is blatant job discrimination against Whites?   We find it hard to care when Whitey academic suffer the Diversity Curse, but why should their innocent White children suffer from it as well when daddy gets frozen in a job while unqualified Diversity gets hired and promoted instead?</p>

		<p> Prior to 1980 Victorville was a sleepy little all white desert town with no crime and a clean wholesome Leave-It-To Beaver atmosphere.  </p>
<p>Then came the influx of blacks and mexicans from crime-ridden Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I was a teacher at Victor valley High School in 1998&hellip;.it was a nightmare. I had to pull my daughter out of it her first year there because she was white and being persecuted.</p>

		<p>The Whites will lose.  We always do.  The laws mandate discrimination against Whites. Nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p>Any school district run by blacks has got to be a mess scholastically, financially and administratively.  Wonder how many brand new computers, TVs, DVD players etc go missing every year?  Wonder who&rsquo;s relatives get paid $90.000 for part time janitor duties?</p>

		<p>Victorville is in the California desert.  It&rsquo;s being ruined by blacks who left the Los Angeles ghetto.  Marry that to the union-run education behemoth in California, with its social agenda, and you end up with this story.</p>

		<p>his type of thing is ging on all across the USA. This has been going on for decades. It must be put to a stop - immediately. The establishment Democrats cheer this on - Whites that are not already corrupted and vigged in are simply not really welcome in the Democrat Party anymore.  </p>
<p>Just as sinful and disgraceful are the Republicans - who seem to care less about the White middle class and the future of the country, as long as they can exploir cheap Mexican labor, and live in gated communities and insular private jobs, and gain the right to avoid being accuded of &#8220;racism&#8221; by ignoring discriination against Whites.  A horrible parlay in a world of horrible choices. Our ONLY hope is to reform the Republican Party agenda to include the interests of discrimnated upon Whites.</p>

		<p>I hate, hate, HATE it when people use the phrase &#8220;reverse discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white administrators were discriminated against, period, and there is no evidence those white administrators had ever discriminated against any blacks; therefore, there is no reverse discrimination.</p>

		<p>&#8220;More equity in discipline for minority employees and students&#8221; means at present they are disciplined as a group more than whites.  But this is probably because the minority employees are absent more or are messing up more, while the minority students are probably bullying more or are more in fights, etc.  Equity would mean, if have the class is B and the other half W, if you expel 2 B&rsquo;s then you must expel 2 Ws, even if they were doing noting wrong.  This discipline by quotas will result in a total lack of discipline for employees and students, and the collapse of the school system.  It is a major reason public schools in cities are so violent and academically weak.<br>
   Let us hope the judges rule in favor to the WM administrators.  They fight not only for their own jobs, but for good schools for all.</p>

<p>Why not apply the label to stories feature white criminals? &#8220;A white man was apprehended in a case police are calling a reverse bank robbery/murder/assault. How about the &#8216;alleged&rsquo; part there at the very beginning of the story?</p>

It would be &#8216;insensitive&rsquo; to use the word &#8216;alleged&rsquo; when discussing a person of color being discriminated against. Not sure i&rsquo;ve read it that way before, &#8216;alleged discrimination&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>Ah, yes beautiful, bucolic, peaceful White Victorville!!&hellip;What?  It isn&rsquo;t?  It too has gone joyfully multicultural???</p>
<p>Victorville was once a place many Whites moved to escape the rising tide of black and brown multicultural &#8220;joy&#8221; in Los Angeles.  Multiculturalism, as you know, a euphemism for White race replacement!!</p>
<p>Victorville and is now a high desert Section 8 stronghold, its high schools a brown/black powder keg. </p>
<p>Blacks and hispanics quickly get out of control and could care less about any repercussions   &mdash;    when have they EVER been held accountable for their actions?   They&rsquo;ve spent the past 15 years hearing that anything they do wrong is the fault of Whites!</p>
<p>June 11, 2011</p>
<p>VICTORVILLE CA June 11 2011  &mdash;  <i>Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies arrested seven people Thursday after a fight broke out during the graduation ceremonies at Victor Valley High School.</i></p>
<p><br>
September 24, 2010   VICTORVILLE • <i>School security personnel used pepper spray to control several fights on Victor Valley High School campus that affected nearly 250 students and lead to the cancellation of classes for the rest of the day, according to officials.</i></p>
<p>AND, these are only the fights that have been REPORTED in the local rag. </p>
<p><i>The lawsuit alleges three black women in a bloc on the district&rsquo;s Board of Trustees &#8216;have developed an agenda to achieve what they characterize as &lsquo;equity&rsquo; to remove Caucasian administrators from the district,&rsquo; according to a complaint filed Sept. 7 in Victorville Superior Court.</i></p>
<p><br>
Oh really??  This is just coming to light now?  This has been going on for YEARS and YEARS and YEARS in school districts everywhere!!  </p>
<p>City of Victorville Demographics by Race (2010):</p>
<p>White:  48.5%</p>
<p>African American:  16.8%</p>
<p>Hispanic or Latino:   47.8%</p>
<p>Demographics of Victor Valley High,  Student Ethnicity:</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latino	  54%</p>
<p>African American	  25%</p>
<p>White	  16%</p>
<p><br>
So Whites ARE in a losing battle.  But then, so are blacks and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before THEY are ousted from the board of trustees AND every other local elected office as well.  The universe has a strange way of righting things eventually, in a Pyrrhic Victory sort of way.  </p>
<p>Small consolation, I know.  We&rsquo;ll see how this case pans out   &mdash;   I give it 50/50 in the White administrators&rsquo; favor.</p>
<p>Bon<br>

<p>If there were only two whites in the entire world, many blacks would blame them for their problems and feel the white person owed them something, even if the only surviving/remaining white people barely had enough food to eat.  Amazing.  </p>
