			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Courtland Milloy, Washington Post, September 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Whenever there&rsquo;s trouble around the Chinatown and Gallery Place Metro stations in the District, the finger of blame often points to a most unusual group of suspects: a black gay gang called Check It.</p>
<p>Depending on whom you talk to, they&rsquo;re just a bunch of mischievous gender benders and drama queens, vulnerable gay youths seeking safety in numbers. Or, they&rsquo;re one of the largest, more aggressive gangs in the city.</p>
<p>To hear the leader of Check It tell it, there may be some truth to both.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just got tired of people beating on me and calling me faggie,&#8221; Tayron Bennett, 21, told me recently. He&rsquo;d helped to organize Check It while a student at Hine Junior High School. Other gay youths from his Trinidad neighborhood in Northeast soon joined, followed by gay youths from throughout the city.</p>
<p>D.C. police estimate that Check It has a core membership of about 20 and counts between 50 and 100 others as &#8220;associates.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first, I tried fighting bullies one-on-one, but they don&rsquo;t fight fair; they fight two and three on one,&#8221; Bennett said. So the youths got together and &#8220;started carrying mace, knives, brass knuckles and stun guns, and if somebody messed with one of us then all of us would gang up on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At Hine, Bennett had been unsure of his sexual identity and was hurt by schoolmates who said he acted gay. When a teacher also said he acted gay, Bennett went into a rage and hit the teacher with the buckle of his belt. He was arrested and expelled from school. He never went back. And he vowed never to run from a bully. No tears. No fears. If attacked on the streets, he wouldn&rsquo;t even call the police. He&rsquo;d just find a way to get his revenge.</p>
<p>The District may have a reputation as a &#8220;gay friendly&#8221; city, home to one of the largest, most affluent and politically influential gay and lesbian communities in the country. But Bennett and his friends live in a world where attitudes toward homosexuality are not always so progressive.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For Bennett, the focus now is just on staying out of trouble. But sitting at home all day is &#8220;boring,&#8221; as he put it. Adding to the restlessness, he knows that Check It members are just a tweet away, eagerly awaiting word from him to meet downtown and start the drama anew.</p>

		<p>The Christopher Street area of Greenwich Village, New York City has been a gay mecca for almost five decades. Still, even New Yorkers like myself who had no use for the place had to admit it was a genteel, low-crime area.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s changed in recent years as gay black teens have begun &#8220;wilding&#8221; and running amok there, much to the horror of the longtime, mostly white residents.  </p>

<p>In the last dozen or so years, there have been several white players who supposedly used anti-black slurs.  The evidence that they did it was as flimsy or even more flimsy than Mr. Simmonds&rsquo;s supposed &#8220;homophobia,&#8221; but they were fined and/or suspended anyway, and the NHL Players Union couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to raise a ruckus.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll see how Official D.C. handles &#8220;Check It.&#8221;  That will tell us who has priority over whom on the left wing totem pole.</p>

		<p>No one should be subject to violence and bullying so I say bravo to the black gay youths protecting themselves.  But why do I have the feeling that this may just turn into another version of typical black flash mobs with a lavender twist?</p>
<p>Would white gays banding together be treated as sympathetically?  Perhaps.  Straight whites? No way.  </p>
<p>The only way gays can live in relative peace and safety is in a white nation.  Same for women and the disabled.  White civilization is the only civilization with a compassion for those groups.</p>

		<p>One of the teachers told him he acted gay, and this was in a junior high school. It&rsquo;s another good example of what a toxic environment the schools have become, and how they&rsquo;re not very selective about who gets to teach. Although, at the same time, it&rsquo;s hard to get good teachers who want to teach in the hood.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t see whites of any age or background ever doing this. I imagine whites simply move somewhere else. That&rsquo;s what they (we) usually do. If whites do band together and fight back, it&rsquo;s called a &#8220;hate group&#8221; and becomes wanted by the authorities. </p>
<p>I do wish these gay black youths luck. As civilization continues to decay, I don&rsquo;t believe they will have any such luck. It will only get worse for them, and us.</p>

		<p>So when it comes to the &#8220;gay&#8221; gene (there isn&rsquo;t one, it&rsquo;s been proven scientifically to not exist) and the black gene, the black gene will be dominant in behavior.  They might swish when they are kicking you in the head when on the ground, or lisp when they are calling you a &#8220;mother******&#8221; and trying to stomp your brains out, but the black thug gene will predominate.  Always.  Thuggery comes first.  All the rest is veneer with these people.</p>

<p>This passage sounds so innocuous, almost idyllic.  I can picture him looking out a window at the birds and butterflies, then turning to his phone to call up some fellows for tea and a jaunt to the bookstore.  Amazing that this is also an admission that the Check It members are just jumping at the chance to maim someone randomly.  What flowery prose for such a scary thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not gay so I would wonder, have you found that kisses and hugs work better to fend of bullies? Personally, I have some experience in finding that violence does indeed solve such problems, BUT! one cannot be squeemish when it comes time to do violence, and ruthless, brutal violence is one thing that bullies, muslims and &#8220;others&#8221; DO understand as do some of us Whites and NOBODY is more efficient at genocide than Whites.</p>

<p>Like many homophobic (perhaps bigoted)people, you are blaming the victims! They are not &#8220;getting away with anything&#8221; to use your arrogant and intellectually dishonset statement. They are responding to the oppression that they are encountering on a routine basis from certain hostile,homophobic citizens.</p>
<p>They have a right to ask to be respected as human beigns. Just becasuse they (and I for that matter) are gay (in this case Black)as well does not mean that we are less than human. We deserve the right to be treated with as much dignity and respect as any heterosexual or other non-Black person.</p>

<p>No, hugs and kisses have not been my response to such violence. Law enforcement and in some cases, other bystanders have come to my aid. This was more effective than taking the law into my own hands. </p>
<p>Some of you need to cease with your sacastic comments. There is a lot, in fact, a disproportionate amont of violence directed toward gay teens and adults. It is a very serious issue that must be confronted.  </p>

<p>The black population of Haiti can hold its&rsquo; own in that department. Read what happened in Haiti in the very early 1800s; the blacks murdered some 100,000 Whites and essentially removed the White population from the country. </p>
<p>To this day, Haiti is a prime example of the Brown Dog effect as depicted in a recent Amren article ( Amren, September 23). I highly recommend that article to all!! </p>

<p>There is hint that homosexuality is genetic. Recent studies have shown that they can switch the &#8220;sexual orientation (which is a progressive biased term since I believe it fits in the definition of disease)&#8221; of flies. You can read about it here: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03cell.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/03/science/03cell.html</a></p>
<p>NOTE: that just because something is genetic doesn&rsquo;t mean it is justified nor does it mean it can&rsquo;t be changed. Two assumptions made by Liberals. And has been dominant thought that is even propagated by Conservative that argue that homosexuality is a choice which alludes to the idea that any genetic component is normal and constructive.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be too entirely sure about that!<br>
It&rsquo;s just that whites have had, in recent centuries, more &#8220;efficiety&#8221; weapons and thus the means. But we have been very restrained. </p>
<p>However, if all things were equal, I would not be at all sure that Blacks, Arabs, Asians could be quite diligent at genocide. (Look at Rwanda.)  And one thing is certain:  they wouldn&rsquo;t have the guilt complex about it that we would. </p>
<p>I certainly don&rsquo;t think we have the same enthusiasm for it.  Look at the Aztecs.  Look at the North American Indians who exterminated entire fellow tribes (eg. Eries, Ottowas, Hurons), without a qualm.  And using just knives and tomahawks! Imagine if they had helicopters, machine guns,  and napalm! </p>

		<p>What is even more depressing than the news story itself is the comments that followed.  Have so many people really taken leave of their senses, that they can view this unspeakabale perversion of homosexuality so cavalierly?  Have we all lost our marbles?</p>
<p>We must have, because we take the perfectly innocent word &#8220;gay&#8221; and corrupt it.  That some even hint that being homosexual is natural or even genetically-induced is beyond fathoming.  I wont dwell on this distasteful subject any longer but will only say that there are many ways for people who have sunk so low as to engage in sodomy to get help, and to extricate thenselves from a lifestyle that will bring them physical death (not to mention spiritual death).</p>
<p>That these black youths are upset illustrates how utterly at sea they are.  Of course people are revolted by buggery.  One man placing his generative organ into another&rsquo;s execratory organ is not an activity that will find much sympathy from people.  St Thomas Aquinas placed usury and sodomy in the same boat: one tries to make what is sterile (money) fertile, while the other tries to make what is fertile, sterile.</p>
<p>And as for &#8220;bullying&#8221;: the only bullying going on is that perpetrated by homoseuxals (using the government and the media) persecuting those who refuse to accept their perversions.</p>

<p>First off, you do not know me or anything about my behavior or disposition. How dare you have the audacity to tell me and other gay people that we are harrassed due to the fact that we &#8220;bring it on ourselves&#8221;! Do &#8220;in your face&#8221; (to use your term) straight people ask for it? Moreover, you probably do not even know what you are talking aobut.    </p>
<p>If anything, it is insecure, homophobic, myopic people like you who advocate violence whether directly or indirectly against gay people who are a major danger to our society. </p>

		<p>If these are black gays defending themselves against black gay bashers, what are they doing in Chinatown?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say looking for Chinese, Chinese walking alone at night, Chinese noticably smaller or much older than these youts to beat up.</p>
<p>3 blocks near any subway stop or freeway off ramp is a danger area.  The black predators swarm up from their lairs to rob, rape, burgularize, beat and murder other races.  Then they fly away to the subway or freeway and get away scott free to return the next night. </p>

<p>The article did not say the thugs were being attacked and defending themselves.  The article said Bennett had been abused years before in school by straight black thugs and was taking his anger out in Chinatown and Gallery Place.</p>
<p>The article was very careful to not mention the race of the meanies who abused Bennett.  When race of thugs who assault and beat others is not mentioned it means the thugs were black.</p>
<p>One can be sure that if the bashers of gay blacks were White it would have been pounded on and pounded on.</p>
<p>Gay? lack? only double affirmative action classification.  Were he a woman he would already have an affirmative action alternative to welfare job.  </p>
<p>He should go to the local mental health clinic, fill out an MMPI as paranoid, hates everybody, talks to God, God talks to him, never eats in restaurants because they will poison him.  </p>

		<p>&#8221; When a teacher also said he acted gay, Bennett went into a rage and hit the teacher with the buckle of his belt. He was arrested and expelled from school.&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt that very much.  I&rsquo;d bet my house and pension it is a blatant lie.  The writer of course never bothered to check out the statement.  Nobody gets expelled from school in DC. It is illegal.</p>
<p>He could have been sent to some special Ed thug holding pen school.<br>

<p>Ever heard of Shaka Zulu?  They didn&rsquo;t even have bows and arrows or guns.  They were not that well organized.  Yet they managed to kill hundreds of thousands of Housas on their way south.</p>
<p>Or Genghis Khan?  When he conquered a town he had his mathmaticians estimate the square feet of the town. They his men killed the inhabitants and cut off their heads until they had enough heads, (not bodies,just heads) to equal the size of the town.</p>
<p>Ask the people of Afghanistan and Iraq about Khan&rsquo;s conquest.  </p>

<p>I know you 2 are on opposite sides of gay issues, but the story is about thugs using the excuse that they are gay going around beating people up.</p>
<p>Gays have often organized neighborhood watch groups.  They patrol<br>
in groups when gays are at risk.  Basically that means after dark especially on Friday and Saturday nights. They don&rsquo;t attack people.  If they see something suspicious they call the police and call out to the thug that they have called the police.</p>
<p>This group however, seeks out people to beat up for no reason.<br>
They are just thugs.  I wonder if they are even gay.</p>

<p>General Lee:</p>
<p>While what you say is true, the fact is the post in question is about Black Gay men being attacked, therefore I see no problem with Gay Black Man and other gay men whether they be Black, White or other races commenting on this topic.   </p>

<p>First off, you do not know me or anything about my behavior or disposition. How dare you have the audacity to tell me and other gay people that we are harrassed due to the fact that we &ldquo;bring it on ourselves&rdquo;! Do &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; (to use your term) straight people ask for it? Moreover, you probably do not even know what you are talking aobut.</p>
<p>If anything, it is insecure, homophobic, myopic people like you who advocate violence whether directly or indirectly against gay people who are a major danger to our society.</p>
<p>The fact is that such rhetoric by you and like-minded others of your ilk should classified as hate speech.<br>

<p>Oh, here goes the gay Black Man curbing our right to free speech&hellip;hate speech he calls it&hellip;..what are you? A marxist too boot? Go live in a communist country where you belong and talk about &#8220;hate speech&#8221;&hellip;</p>
<p>As for your name calling, homophobic, insecure, etc. shows us exactly what you are.</p>

<p>BTW, by you saying you are &#8220;white&#8221; right off the bat, gives me pause. WHY did you start your sentence with that? You are not &#8220;white&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>Oh, isn&rsquo;t this always the case&hellip;.The family members of &#8220;gays&#8221; always defending their lifestyle. Wonder what YOUR God would say about that. You put your son over YOUR God, if you even have one, that is&hellip;  Bet if your son was a murderer and rapist you will still defend him, right? </p>
<p>Parents like you remind me of those mommas who say about their murdering thug sons, &#8220;oh, he is such a good boy and changing his life around&#8221;..</p>

		<p>Gay Black Man says,</p>
<p>They have a right to ask to be respected as human beigns. Just becasuse they (and I for that matter) are gay (in this case Black)as well does not mean that we are less than human. We deserve the right to be treated with as much dignity and respect as any heterosexual or other non-Black person.<br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p> How is being gay or black deserving of our respect? Because you are a &#8220;human being&#8221;?  Pray tell, you have a warped mind if you truly believe your own nonsense.</p>
<p>Dignity and respect, you ask? For what? Being gay? Just the opposite, my dear..that&rsquo;s like saying no matter what one does and how degrading it is, that we should all treat them with &#8220;dignity and respect&#8221;? No, thank you. Quit trying to normalize your lifestyle by making the rest of us &#8220;feel guilty&#8221; for not accepting it&hellip;.I will NEVER feel guilty for knowing something is wrong and stating it is wrong.</p>
