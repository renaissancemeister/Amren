<h1><a href="https://newsone.com/nation/associatedpress4/churches-remain-highly-segregated-in-21st-century/">Churches Remain Highly Segregated in 21st Century</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NewsOne, September 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are currently between 300,000 and 350,000 congregations in the U.S., according to Michael Emerson, a sociology professor and co-director of Rice University&rsquo;s Kinder Institute for Urban Research in Houston, Texas. Ninety-two percent are homogeneous, meaning at least 80 percent of the congregation is comprised of a single racial group.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pastors Ken Whitten and Jeffery Singletary have a similar practice.</p>
<p>Whitten, who is white, is the pastor of Idlewild Baptist Church in Lutz, Fla., and Singletary, who is black, led the 50-member Mission of Life church in Tampa.</p>
<p>Whitten said he approached Singletary with the idea of starting a multiethnic church.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&rsquo;re going to change our culture, they&rsquo;ve got to see it,&#8221; Whitten recalled telling him at the time.</p>
<p>From that conversation was born Singletary&rsquo;s Exciting Central Baptist, which currently has about 760 members. Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy attends, and late NFL Hall of Famer Lee Roy Selmon was a member.</p>
<p>For one of Selmon&rsquo;s recent funeral services, Whitten allowed the service to be held at his nearly 10,000-member church and Singletary preached the eulogy, an example of how the two pastors also switch pulpits and merge their congregations.</p>
<p>Singletary says such a practice &#8220;aligns with the heart of the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we look at scripture, God&rsquo;s heart is on the nation; people of every tongue, of every tribe of every kindred,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We serve a Baskin-Robbins kind of a God; a God of 32 flavors or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>As was the case when there was a secular push for integration decades ago, multiethnic congregations have had resistance. Opponents often prefer a certain type of worship style or remain opposed to any type of change in regards to race.</p>
<p>Shaun Casey, professor of Christian ethics at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C., said more congregations are &#8220;entertaining the question of becoming multiracial and multiethnic&#8221; because they&rsquo;re starting to pattern the diversity of the neighborhoods around them.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged &#8220;predominantly white churches are often very, very reluctant to actively pursue a multiracial composition out of pure fear and ignorance,&#8221; and black churches &#8220;fear losing autonomy and tradition.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As the nation prepares to dedicate a monument to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington next month, his daughter, Elder Bernice A. King, hopes churches will embrace the universal beliefs of her father and understand that &#8220;God is global.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to have to create what we want to see in society within the church,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think it begins in the church.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I am atheist and PROUD Of it- those so called &#8216;white nationalist conservatives&rsquo; don&rsquo;t even realize that it was the church itself that promoted equality and told everyone that race = skin color and skin colo r= race and that all of us are equal and all that.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that most atheist organizations in the U.S. are racially liberal and white nationalists embrace Christianity, the same religion/churches told everyone that &#8216;we are all equal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Read &#8220;The Origin of The Species&#8221; and find out atheism is more line with white racialists than Christianity.</p>
<p>Also the skin color = race and race = skin color makes my family the same race as those violent Africans! UGH!</p>

		<p>I was raised in a small Methodist Church in the South and we always considered shouting, screaming, loud outbursts and rock music to be totally inappropriate conduct for a church.</p>
<p>The main reason there are so few blacks in predominately white churches is that they find it boring. They want to be entertained.  </p>

		<p>Look for this shameful news to spur those White churches into action. </p>
<p>We must embrace diversity and inclusion, celebrate diversity and welcome differences!  We can start by following the lead of the Charleston, S.C., city council by also voting to put up a new monument to slain civil rights leader and icon Martin Luther King! Unless our White children are surrounded by images of the civil rights martyrs, they might become too spiritually invested in all this White Privilege we are giving them.  Time to pull them out of private school and send them down to learn with the achievement oriented blacks on the other side of town!</p>

		<p>It would be possible to write a 1000 page thesis on this subject and still not come to any firm conclusions.I believe in unity for all Christians but lets look at some of the simple realities;</p>
<p>Here in Sydney we have churches established for gay and lesbian elements of society, I would not go near them but acknowledge their right to exist. We have an extreme charasmatic congregation nearby, I often feel embarrased when I attend and see some very questionable theology! I find the local Greek Orthodox priest a very friendly man but I could never really be part of that congregation. (My Greek would simply not be good enough). We have Filippino and Pacific Islander congregations here, they are wonderful Christian people but the reality is that they prefer to do there own thing.</p>
<p>On a Sunday morning I like to be able to attend a church of my choice and feel comfortable with both what is being taught from the pulpit and with the people around me and hopefully receive spiritual and moral guidance. I do not attend any church to get political indoctrination.</p>
<p>Quote from the original article: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to create what we want to see in society within the church,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think it begins in the church.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The Church is not the place for social engineering. Especially when we see the likes of Elder(!) Bernice King, the daughter of MLK behind it all. </p>

		<p>Keep your charismatic, voodoo nonsense flailing around out of my church, thank you very much.  All are welcome, but we preach the Bible with no nonsense, no bands, no hip hopping, no silly idea that Christ was a socialist come here to spread the wealth around by taking from those who earn and giving to those who won&rsquo;t work or are less intellectually capable of holding down higher paying jobs.  I haven&rsquo;t yet heard the phrase G*dd**n America or Heimee or k**e nor have I been told I should accept the guilt of all sinners against blacks past present and future.  As to churches falling in attendance, duh.  The Bible foretells this.  But when you import only voodoo blacks, hindus, taoists, muslims and buddhists whereas before we imported Europeans seeking true liberty and escape from communism&hellip;&hellip;.who were practicing Christians&hellip;.what do you expect?</p>

		<p>As a life-long dweller in the Bible Belt, I can tell you that blacks attend black churches because they like them.  There are many white-congregation churches in the South (and there are many, period!) that would not make blacks feel unwelcome if the latter chose to attend.  In fact, there are a significant number of Pentecostal churches with racially mixed congregations.  Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness and LDS churches often have black members.  Large charismatic churches that are majority white often have at least a few black attendees.  <br>
Liberals love to talk about the fact that Sunday is the most segregated day of the week.  Of course, many of them are atheists, regardless of what they claim.  But, since they will criticize non-whites for absolutely nothing, they have no condemnation of the religiosity of blacks.  </p>
<p>Sureesh #1, I have to say this:  You should thank whatever powers that be that the Englishmen who came to India were Christians and had Judeo-Christian values  &mdash;  unlike the godless commies who decimated some of your nearby neighbors.  <br>
And, let me add that commenters on this site have told you over and over that it&rsquo;s not skin color that is the problem with blacks.</p>

		<p>The US Census for 2000 documents that whites are married to whites and blacks are married to blacks more than 95% of the time. Self-segregation seems to be happening, just like in churches, with few complains and at no social cost.</p>

<p>Actually, most of India is devout Hindu; even  many of the very intelligent believe in this ridiculous, outdated superstitious religion. There are very few atheists in India.</p>
<p>Upon coming to the U.S., I already knew that Hinduism was a bunch of nonsense so I thought I&rsquo;d give Christianity a try. I read the Bible and was extremely amused so many grown adults can believe all those fairy tales. </p>
<p>Do you guys really believe that the earth is 6000 years old or the story of Noah&rsquo;s ark and that millions of species of animals could fit in that rickety boat? You believe that god created the earth and the entire universe in 7 days?</p>
<p>Have you read Darwin&rsquo;s origin of the species? Evolution provides a good case to support your racial stance. Read about evolution and survival of the fittest. Many of today&rsquo;s churches preach that god created us all equal and are raising money to send money to Africa and bring African refuges to the U.S.</p>
<p>Darwin&rsquo;s stance was to allow natural selection to take it&rsquo;s course. Without white support, Africans would be less than 1 percent of the world&rsquo;s population due to high death rates.</p>

		<p> Does anyone know what is the percentage of White Americans in the southern states who are religious compared to white Americans in the non-southern states?  I would guess it is higher but as there are so many blacks in the southern states they must really skew the religious demographics though you would never hear a word said about them by the type of PC whites foaming at the mouth about their &#8216;new atheism&rsquo; drivel. </p>

		<p>Blacks and Muslims are safe as a minority amongst us. But we are not safe as a minority amongst them.</p>
<p>That is why whites do not follow blacks and Muslims around the world trying to live in their countries, asking for their social security and other benefits. But they do. </p>
<p>Unless we segregate, our genetic code will be mixed and destroyed for all time.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not hate, it&rsquo;s just the truth. Those who support mass immigration are waging a genetic war against the white race. They are the haters.</p>

		<p> As was mentioned above, more than once, the mainline Protestant churches seem to have a thing about changing their services in order to try to attract more blacks, young people, yada yada.</p>
<p> Obviously they can do what they want, but what I like and admire about the Eastern Orthodox churches (I am not a member of one, by the way), is that while they welcome anyone who sincerely wants to join, regardless of race, they will not change and &#8220;modernize&#8221; their Divine Liturgy to suit modern tastes.</p>
<p> Their liturgy is believed to be substantially unchanged since biblical days; musical instruments are not permitted in their services, but their choirs sing beautiful chants; and if you join, you are expected to adjust to the church. It doesn&rsquo;t adjust for you.</p>

		<p>When I was at the CofCC National Meeting in the Summer of 2003, which was held in a very nice hotel/recreation complex in the Mississippi suburbs of Memphis, a black church group from Nashville was there the same weekend.  (I figured, just what Mississippi needs   &mdash;   It must not have enough blacks so that it has to import more from Nashville,  C&rsquo;est la vie.)  </p>
<p>We were in one of the large ballrooms to the side of the complex, and the black church group occupied an octagonal room in about the middle of the facility.  As our proceedings were taking a break, I had to fetch something from my room, and that path took me past that octagonal room.  As I was passing by, I heard a speaker, a black woman, say this:</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more diversity up here in these churches!&#8221;</p>
<p>Everyone started clapping and hootin&rsquo; and hollerin&rsquo; in agreement, of course, all black.</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t any of them note the irony?  I guess she said it because she thought it sounded all cute and clever and tolerant coming out of her mouth and she thought it would be the same going into her audience&rsquo;s eardrums, and they all cheered because it sounded like a bon mot.</p>
<p>However, the only way to make their particular church(es) more diverse in the literal sense is to make them less black.  </p>
<p>Of course, what she probably meant and they probably interpreted is that the black churches should stay all black and the non-black churches should get blacker.</p>

		<p>As a means of reaching out to the black community the church elders have hired young black males as musicians and singers and brought them into the youth fellowship.</p>
<p>The WHITE church elders are paying young black guys to come in and be friendly with the white girls.  Of the six blacks I have seen each of them has a pretty and young white girl hanging on him.  The WHITE parishioners do not appear to notice.  </p>
<p>When I questioned one the elders about this he said that eventually all the races were going to mix and so therefore the church had an obligation to help bring all God&rsquo;s genes together.  Besides it did not matter, he said.<br>

		<p>Segregation in church is an interesting issue. I am a Christian, and I believe that Jesus&rsquo;s blood is a new covenant, shed for many for the remission of sins. I believe that this means that, as the apostle Paul put it, &#8220;there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8221; Jesus&rsquo;s offer of salvation is available to all. And yet I do not take Galatians 3.28 as an endorsement of multiculturalism, and I would not attend a church which was not almost exclusively White. I would in fact prefer that my church be all White. I do not support ordination of women, and would be unlikely to attend services presided over by a woman. </p>
<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? The sacraments will be effective if given by a woman, or by someone of a different race. The sacraments are even effective if given by an heretic (this was established very early in the history of the church, according to Gibbon, and makes perfect sense when you think about it: The sacraments do not come from the minister, who is a sinner like everyone else, but from God). And yet I would much rather receive the sacraments from a White man. A woman or a non-White could have understanding of scripture, and ability to write and deliver a sermon that would inform or inspire. Yet I would rather listen to the preaching of a White man. Why?</p>
<p>Wherever two or three are gathered in Jesus&rsquo;s name, Jesus is there with them. He said so. So I don&rsquo;t believe that the racial make up of a church meeting matters to God. But it can matter to us. It seems that Whites would rather worship with other Whites, Blacks with other Blacks, and Chinese with other Chinese. And this is perfectly natural, since diversity is a source of misunderstanding and conflict, and a church riven by conflict is not a good place to worship. </p>
<p>Now what about the situation where a non-White comes to my (mostly) White church to worship? I don&rsquo;t know. To say &#8220;we ought not to let him worship here&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t sound right: Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners. Jesus forgives even me. Jesus invites all to His table. Yet if many non-Whites come to my church, it will become a foreign place, a place where I do not want to be, and it is reasonable that I would not want that to happen. Well, non-Whites largely want to worship with Whites no more than Whites want to worship with non-Whites, which appears to be very little, so maybe the problem doesn&rsquo;t arise too much in practice, unless a White congregation actively tries to become more diverse, or is located in a place undergoing severe race replacement. I don&rsquo;t know the answers, and I don&rsquo;t really think that there are simple answers.<br>

		<p>Comments like the ones posted here are why the church largely remains segregated.  It is the members often - people make race an idol and put it before Christ.  I&rsquo;ve been in a number of integrated churches and my Christian friends run the gamut - white, black, hispanic. And by friend - I don&rsquo;t mean people that I just talk to at church.  I&rsquo;m talking about people who have opened their homes to me and I to them, we eat together, pray together, laugh, cry, and talk together.  But, I think things tend to be different among Charismatics and that there is more integration there.  I&rsquo;ve noticed less integration among non-Charismatic and churches that are denominational and when I walk into those churches, I can sometimes feel the resistance right away.  People sometimes tend to be more standoffish to people who look different than the majority.  That isn&rsquo;t always the case though.  I used to visit a Presbyterian congregation occassionally - and they had a mix of people.  I never felt uncomfortable there.  I know of an Episcopal church that is the same way and I&rsquo;m sure there are many others.  </p>
<p>I do think that people tend to go to places that are culturally comfortable for them.  But I do think that sometimes people make excuses so that they don&rsquo;t have to address what could be happening in their own congregations that might exclude people.  I once went to a church (happened to be Charismatic, ironically) where one of the people in leadership was incredibly racist.  He would use a racial epithet as he was talking - but he shortened it.  I felt led to stay for a short period of time so I endured - and the senior citizens there took me under their wings.  But, if I hadn&rsquo;t felt led to stay for that period of time, I would have left.  Further irony - he wanted to minister to black people in the inner city.  (How can you minister without love?  I don&rsquo;t get it.)  And this isn&rsquo;t just white congregations either. I used to attend a church that was 99 percent black and I remember a young asian woman visiting.  Almost no one greeted her or spoke to her.  She tried coming back several times.  I talked with her, but my heart broke for her.  Today I&rsquo;d be more proactive with connecting her with other people, but I didn&rsquo;t know to do that then.  Eventually she stopped coming, which was a shame.  </p>
<p>Racist stereotypes abound.  Look at some of the comments written here. Not all black people &#8220;want entertainment&#8221; and the &#8220;hip hopping&#8221;  (I had to laugh when I read these crazy characterizations.)  Every black church doesn&rsquo;t preach liberation theology.  The facts are that people are different and have different preferences and theological bents.  Some like to have  a lively church experience, some like to have a more stately one.  I once went to a predominantely black church that had two services.  The more formal, stately one and the lively one.  This was to accomodate the different tastes and styles of the congregation.</p>
<p>The church I attend now is predominantly white.  10 percent or so of the congregation is black and probably an equal number are latino. This reflects the population of the area.  The music is contemporary - a mix of praise and worship, CCM, and a dash of gospel thrown in.  The pastor treats everyone the same so there are no barriers to people coming in.  I believe if more churches did that, the churches would look more like the communities in which they are placed. </p>

		<p>  Church is time with me and my family. I am not a hateful person but want to go were I am comfortable. Most of our congregation have alot in common and this makes for a nice comfortable surrounding. I wish for all to find god and worship, for if they truly do this should reduce crime and make for a more pleasant world for us all. I think an all black or all white church is fine. God said were two or three are gathered in his name there he shall be also. Only we are nit-picking at who those two or three should be. Quit trying to demonize us that simply come together with those we have alot in common with.</p>

		<p>We must embrace diversity and inclusion, celebrate diversity and welcome differences! &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;This statement is completely overused and has brought america so much conflict and pain. Which differences should we celebrate? The diversity of some races to have higher crime rates that they feel are justified, more fatherless homes, lack of self control and respect of others, substantially more use of government handouts and less overall productivity. The differences in religions in were many truly call for the death of christians, call for women to be slaves that must be covered from head to toe, justify the death of infidels and state they will be rewarded with virgins upon their death. </p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;predominantly white churches are often very, very reluctant to actively pursue a multiracial composition out of pure <b>fear and ignorance</b>,&rdquo; and black churches <b>&ldquo;fear losing autonomy and tradition</b>.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So when whites want to maintain whiteness, it&rsquo;s fear and ignorance, but when blacks want to preserve blackness, it&rsquo;s to preserve autonomy and tradition. Typical liberal double standard. </p>

<p>Comments like the ones posted here are why the church largely remains segregated. It is the members often - people make race an idol and put it before Christ. I&rsquo;ve been in a number of integrated churches and my Christian friends run the gamut - white, black, hispanic. And by friend - I don&rsquo;t mean people that I just talk to at church. I&rsquo;m talking about people who have opened their homes to me and I to them, we eat together, pray together, laugh, cry, and talk together. But, I think things tend to be different among Charismatics and that there is more integration there. I&rsquo;ve noticed less integration among non-Charismatic and churches that are denominational and when I walk into those churches, I can sometimes feel the resistance right away. People sometimes tend to be more standoffish to people who look different than the majority. That isn&rsquo;t always the case though. I used to visit a Presbyterian congregation occassionally - and they had a mix of people. I never felt uncomfortable there. I know of an Episcopal church that is the same way and I&rsquo;m sure there are many others.</p>
<p>I do think that people tend to go to places that are culturally comfortable for them. But I do think that sometimes people make excuses so that they don&rsquo;t have to address what could be happening in their own congregations that might exclude people. I once went to a church (happened to be Charismatic, ironically) where one of the people in leadership was incredibly racist. He would use a racial epithet as he was talking - but he shortened it. I felt led to stay for a short period of time so I endured - and the senior citizens there took me under their wings. But, if I hadn&rsquo;t felt led to stay for that period of time, I would have left. Further irony - he wanted to minister to black people in the inner city. (How can you minister without love? I don&rsquo;t get it.) And this isn&rsquo;t just white congregations either. I used to attend a church that was 99 percent black and I remember a young asian woman visiting. Almost no one greeted her or spoke to her. She tried coming back several times. I talked with her, but my heart broke for her. Today I&rsquo;d be more proactive with connecting her with other people, but I didn&rsquo;t know to do that then. Eventually she stopped coming, which was a shame.</p>
<p>Racist stereotypes abound. Look at some of the comments written here. Not all black people &ldquo;want entertainment&rdquo; and the &ldquo;hip hopping&rdquo; (I had to laugh when I read these crazy characterizations.) Every black church doesn&rsquo;t preach liberation theology. The facts are that people are different and have different preferences and theological bents. Some like to have a lively church experience, some like to have a more stately one. I once went to a predominantely black church that had two services. The more formal, stately one and the lively one. This was to accomodate the different tastes and styles of the congregation.</p>
<p>The church I attend now is predominantly white. 10 percent or so of the congregation is black and probably an equal number are latino. This reflects the population of the area. The music is contemporary - a mix of praise and worship, CCM, and a dash of gospel thrown in. The pastor treats everyone the same so there are no barriers to people coming in. I believe if more churches did that, the churches would look more like the communities in which they are placed. <br>

<p>What are you doing here? Scolding us for not wanting the integration of the races? In or out of church? </p>
<p> I am sure you would feel more comfortable in the PC worldly churches you seem to embrace. There are plenty of PC Christian forums you can comment on and you all can pat each other on the backs for your &#8220;inclusiveness&rsquo; and your so-called &#8220;good works&#8221;. God doesn&rsquo;t put much stock in your &#8220;good works&#8221; so keep living in your fantasy world. AMEN.</p>

<p>Then why did YOU bother to stop and post your comment since we do believe in those racist &#8220;sterotypes&#8221;?  I bet you go back to your church and tell them all about us &#8220;haters&#8221;. Right? Maybe even you can get up and give a sermon on White &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>BTW, where is YOUR Christian love towards us? Are you not suppose to love everyone and be all &#8220;inclusive&#8221; according to your post?</p>
<p>I suggest with an open mind and not a closed one, you start reading the archives here and the current subject matters (REAL news articles) and all the &#8220;stereotypes&#8221; that we seem to have are legit after all. I believe in the old adage: You go your way and we will go our way. Deal?</p>
<p>Maybe you are a Christian troll? That is my suspicion. </p>

<p>I believe in the Divine Authorship of the Bible.</p>
<p>In the beginning, God said, &ldquo;Let there be Light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jesus said men loved &ldquo;the dark&rdquo; because there sins could not be seen.</p>
<p>Ham&rsquo;s son was punished with &ldquo;dark skin&rdquo; and the added curse of having to serve.</p>
<p>The Bilbe is where we got our ideas about White and Black and Light and Dark. We are told that God is Light and that in Heaven there will never again be darkness.</p>
<p>On AmRen today, I once again read of Blacks attacking (again in Philadelphia) Whites at night when it is dark.</p>
<p>Are the PC imbeciles going to rewrite the Bible, and are they going to tell Night to stop being Dark and Day to stop being Light. AmRen is a Light. Western Civilization has been The Light in a dark world.</p>
<p>And lastly, White women are the loveliest creatures on God&rsquo;s Earth. I am sure that some loud, obese, hateful non-White female will soon demand we outlaw White hotties.<br>
 &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash;  &mdash; </p>
<p>A question for you. Do you honestly believe that God turned Ham&rsquo;s son into a black man? If so, where did the black race come from well before Ham was even born? Gen. 1 tells of the &ldquo;creation&rdquo; of other races, plants etc.. Gen. 2 tells of God &ldquo;forming&rdquo; Adam and Eve while blowing into his nostrils. HE created Eve for Adam because HE and Adam &ldquo;looked&rdquo; around and could not find a suitable mate for Adam. WHO were those people they &ldquo;looked&rdquo; at? Why was there no one suitable for Adam? These were TWO separate events that the church will never tell you about. Those two events were thousands of years apart (if not millions), not a &ldquo;day&rdquo; as we are led to believe. Otherwise, why have TWO separate chapters on these two completely different &ldquo;creations&rdquo; if it were just ONE creation? God isn&rsquo;t stupid as we seem to be. Remember a &ldquo;day&rdquo; in the Bible consists of thousands of years not man&rsquo;s 24 hour day. HE rested on the 7th day (after creation) and THEN He formed Adam. (Gen. 2)</p>
<p>The church tells us that ALL men are only 6,000 years old. How can that be? Even the Chinese have been here way longer than that with documented proof. Adam and Eve and their descendants are 6,000 years old, but not all of mankind. Too much evidence to the contrary. God made 3 distinct races of people, including Adam and Eve. The rest came from fallen mans mixing the seed lines. Adam and Eve did NOT have different races of offspring! That is impossible. That would totally go against God&rsquo;s Law. God does NOT break HIS own Law. Kind after kind was meant for man and not just the animals.</p>

		<p>I personally think that we should welcome ChristianWoman here. &#8220;Go post on boards where they agree with you&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t encourage debate. Yes, she used the R word, and calling people &#8220;r*cists&#8221; is offensive to many, but I think that she is nonetheless worthy of engaging in cordial debate: Most with her views would not even have posted here. </p>
<p>The point in ChristianWoman&rsquo;s post which I want to address is &#8220;It is the members often - people make race an idol and put it before Christ.&#8221; She seems to imply that those, like me, who prefer a segregated church, do make race an idol, and that if we did not make race an idol, but retained a focus on Christ, our churches would &#8220;look more like the communities in which they are placed,&#8221; and that this would be a good thing.</p>
<p>But who is really making race an idol? And why must a church gathering reflect the racial makeup of the geographical area around it? The purpose of a church gathering is to commune together with Christ, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter (from Christ&rsquo;s viewpoint) whether the people doing so on some occasion are all Black, all White, or a mixture. At least, so I argued earlier, and nobody has offered a rebuttal. If Blacks worship together and Whites worship together, how does the church not reflect the various communities in the area? The church is, after all, all believers, regardless of where and when and with whom they meet. If believers gather together and worship where and when and with whom they are comfortable worshiping, how is that making race an idol?</p>
<p>But when church leaders try to promote diversity in their meetings for its own sake, saying, in effect, &#8220;we&rsquo;re too White to please God,&#8221; how is this not making race an idol? God loves Whites as well as non-Whites. I would be particularly interested in learning why ChristianWoman believes that an all-White church meeting is less pleasing to God than is a racially diverse church meeting. <br>

<p>I tire of this &#8220;God loves us all to mix&#8221; and I have posted many times over the last couple of years where just the opposite is true. HE wants us separate and in our OWN nations (boundaries) that HE has set up for us. READ the Bible.</p>
<p> Most White Christians seem to have that same ole misplaced white guilt complex and feel &#8220;good&#8221; when they can mix it up racially and &#8220;think&#8221; that is pleasing to God &#8220;as long as they are all &#8220;Christians&#8221;&hellip;like they can possibly know what is pleasing to Him! We know how mankind can twist and supplants what he wants into their own interpretation.</p>
<p> We do SEE how this mixing of races in America and Europe HAS all but destroyed the WHITE races in those countries, haven&rsquo;t we? Isn&rsquo;t that proof (evidence) enough that this isn&rsquo;t God&rsquo;s Plan in the first place? When America was mostly White we did NOT have a fraction of the crime or problems we now have in every aspect of our lives. Think about it.</p>
<p>If you think Christian Woman posting her programmed mind here and calling us all hateful and racists then you go ahead and fall for it and debate her. </p>
