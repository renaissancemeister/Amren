C-span broadcast an Hispanic round-table discussion recently.</p>
<p>Basically it focused on two points. Hispanics are the fastest growing minority so they should be given more say and power. The second point was that Hispanic youth are failing in schools and apparently it&rsquo;s our fault because we&rsquo;re not giving them the resources they need to soar.</p>
<p>What they want is power and money. <br>

		<p>&#8220;Basically it focused on two points. Hispanics are the fastest growing minority so they should be given more say and power. The second point was that Hispanic youth are failing in schools and apparently it&rsquo;s our fault because we&rsquo;re not giving them the resources they need to soar.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a connection here that yuppies won&rsquo;t get until it&rsquo;s too late. It&rsquo;s excessive education and underpaid graduate jobs that are killing the white race. Well, the pay does become very good, from age 45-65+, but children are off the table by then. This is long term thinking that destroys civilizations.</p>
<p>Whites want a 150k education and a good school district house for 250k. Hispanics (and a lot of evangelical whites, mind you) drop out of high school to become lower-middle class machinists or carpenters or landscapers or whatever, and the more academically inclined will simply homeschool. They spend about 50k on a home, if that, and live within their means. They CAN AFFORD CHILDREN.</p>
<p>For whites to succeed, ironically, Hispanics absolutely must be given the &#8220;resources they need to soar&#8221;. They won&rsquo;t take that bait, though. Too little IQ, yet too much intelligence.</p>

		<p>how about we boot nobama from the white house and make his new gang banger house in the thickest concentration of this beloved group of south of the border illegals that he dotes on. I wonder if his views would change? (yes, I did not capitalize nobama and white house for all respect has been lost)</p>

		<p>The President likes to sit at a roundtable rather than himself<br>
going toe-to-toe in civil but stringent debate.  He then likes <br>
to pull together what he hears that he likes or can use and<br>
give his imprimatur to what is significant and not significant.<br>
He&rsquo;s not much of a generator or originator.  Dare we call him an<br>
over-seer?   </p>

		<p>Enjoy your burrito, Senior Obama! <br>
It&rsquo;s one of the last little treats you&rsquo;ll get in the oval office.<br>
The Mestizos won&rsquo;t be enough to rescue you from a shattering defeat.<br>
13 months and counting&hellip;</p>

		<p>Main point:the Democratic Party is openly waging a race-war agaisnt the Native Born White American Majority. If the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had been passed, the Democratic Party would be an insignificant minor Party in 2011. The Democratic Party&rsquo;s post-1965 election strategy has been to import a high-fertility voting block from Latin America and other places with the intent of having this high fertility voting block out vote the Native Born White Amerian Majority..it is pure unadulturated race-based treason. Millions of Native Born White Americans are under no obligation to tolerate this.</p>
<p>To the poltical liberals out there:eventually the nonwhites will throw you overboard and elect their own kind to office. Here is the main point:not only will you not be welcomed in the socially and culturally nonwhite regions of the former America-how ironic that in the futute the Democratic Party will be socially and culturally intolerant and conservative-you will not be welcomed in the White regions of the former America. Your destructive presence will not be tolerated for a second. Have you ever thought about what you are doing and the massive consequences that it will have for White Liberals? Liberals are effectively destroying themselves..not that I care one bit.</p>

		<p>#4  &#8220;not much of a generator or originator&#8221;<br>
In his NPR review of THE BELL CURVE, back when he was a lawyer in Chicago, now President Obama&rsquo;s remarks seem &#8220;paste and scissors&#8221; assemblage of clinches in print  &mdash;  not products of <br>
any confrontation he brought personally to the topic or any hard work he invested in examing the topic.  It would be interesting if he brings clear indication of a personal investment in the topic of Hispanics in America.  </p>

		<p>liberals ARE destroying themselves you are right and taking everybody else with them it makes sense because liberals are sick mentally ill people who hate themselves and humanity, many are suicidal in their personal lives so it makes sense that it would carry over into their politics. </p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more.  Today, a college degree is almost worthless due to credential inflation.  Too many affirmative action babies have degrees which has devalued it - it&rsquo;s probably worth what a high school diploma was not too long ago.  Today, one needs a Master&rsquo;s degree just to be competitive - and that&rsquo;s no guarantee either.</p>
<p>You might be interested in a book called &#8220;Shop Class as Soulcraft&#8221; by Matthew Crawford.  He has a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and once headed a respected think tank before leaving it all to pursue fixing motorcycles.  Here&rsquo;s a snippet from the back flap:</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who felt hustled off to college, then to the cubicle, Shop Class as Soulcraft seeks to restore the honor of the manual trades as a life worth choosing.</p>
<p>&hellip;Matthew Crawford makes a case for the kind of work that requires mastery of real things.  Surprisingly, such work can be more intellectually demanding than the sort that deals in abstractions.  Maintenance and repair work also cultivate certain ethical virtues, fostering habits of individual responsibility.  Shop Class as Soulcraft rouses us from the passivity and dependence of consumer culture with a bracing call for self-reliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>I made the mistake of earning a B.A. in Political Science a few years ago.  I have since worked in mindless office jobs, including a political consultancy firm where our boss made us dumpster dive for intel on opposing candidates - I stayed there for 2 months before refusing to sacrifice my self-respect any further.  You know how much I made? $12/hr.  That&rsquo;s what my degree was worth - and in this recession that&rsquo;s generous.  On the other hand, my friend never went to college and became an electrician right out of high school.  He currently makes $25/hr.  </p>
<p>Crawford points out in his book that tradesmen are actually quite wealthy.  Ever see those latinos driving brand new Ford trucks blasting mariachi music?  They&rsquo;re tradesmen on the lower end of the curve, but can still afford expensive trucks AND 4+ kids.  A White tradesman who can actually run a business can easily become a millionaire, and faster than working the corporate grind.  Most importantly, your spirit isn&rsquo;t crushed at the end of the day.  Ever watch a movie called Office Space?</p>

<p>I would start one of those firms if (A) I could scrape up the seed money, and (B) If St. Louis and Missouri politics were more salacious.  Maybe I should feel fortunate in a way that good ole home has politics that boring.</p>

		<p>That the President (who works hard &#8220;to be Black enough&#8221; ) feels<br>
he can relate to Hispanics and also harvest votes from Blacks is<br>
a bit of a Houdini act.  </p>
