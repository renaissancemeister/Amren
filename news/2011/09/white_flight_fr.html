			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), August 31, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ethnic minorities now form a majority in eight of America&rsquo;s biggest metropolitan areas, according to new statistics.</p>
<p>Washington D.C. joins New York, San Diego, Las Vegas and Memphis in showing a &#8216;white flight&rsquo; from some of the countries most populated zones.</p>
<p>The results highlighted a much wider national trend as it emerged non-Hispanic whites are now a minority in 22 of the country&rsquo;s 100-biggest urban areas.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Washington Post, demographer with the Brookings Institution William Frey said: &#8216;What&rsquo;s happened is pivotal.</p>
<p>&#8216;Large metropolitan areas will be the laboratories for change.</p>
<p>&#8216;The measures they take to help minorities assimilate and become part of the labor force will be studied by other parts of the country that are whiter and haven&rsquo;t been touched as much by the change.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One of the reasons suggested for the shift was the ageing of the white population coupled with the relative youth of the Hispanic and Asian populations.</p>
<p>Demographers have been shocked by the rapid changes seen in Washington D.C.  &mdash;  particularly in the area&rsquo;s schools.</p>
<p>A report by the Northern Virginia Regional Commission noticed that student numbers had grown by almost 119,000 from 1995 to 2010.</p>
<p>The number of those students who were white rose by little over 1,000.</p>
<p>The news comes as the wealth gaps between whites and minorities grew to their widest levels in a quarter-century.</p>
<p>The recession and uneven recovery have erased decades of minority gains, leaving whites on average with 20 times the net worth of blacks and 18 times that of Hispanics, according to new Census data released in July.</p>
<p>The analysis shows the racial and ethnic impact of the economic meltdown, which ravaged housing values and sent unemployment soaring.</p>
<p>The median wealth of white U.S. households in 2009 was $113,149, compared with $6,325 for Hispanics and $5,677 for blacks, according to the analysis released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>Those ratios, roughly 20 to 1 for blacks and 18 to 1 for Hispanics, far exceed the low mark of 7 to 1 for both groups in 1995, when the nation&rsquo;s economic expansion lifted many low-income groups to the middle class, the Associated Press reports.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to read these cities major newspapers and learn anything other than &#8216;minorities great&rsquo;, whites racist and standing in the way, more diversity needed. There are different versions of this, of course. Because these writers are pretty good since that&rsquo;s what they do for a living and they get paid well. </p>

		<p>This article was carelessly written.  The author used the terms &#8216;average&rsquo; and &#8216;median&rsquo; interchangeably.  Plus, the wealth figures have little relevance to the rest of the article.  Was the editor asleep?<br>

This seems to contradict recent articles that report DC and New York are becoming whiter. Perhaps they are becoming whiter but at a very slow rate.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;The measures they take to help minorities assimilate and become part of the labor force will be studied by other parts of the country that are whiter and haven&rsquo;t been touched as much by the change.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Who are the &#8220;they&#8221; in this sentence? The few remaining white people?</p>
<p>Once again the failure of minorities to get ahead will be blamed on white people for not taking the appropriate measures to make sure minorities succeed.</p>
<p>Minority failure will always be our fault.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t tell which way this leftie is playing the field on this one. He&rsquo;s saying that Whites had to flee their comfort zones and takes a gleeful tone when saying so. But then he&rsquo;s upset that the aging White population has a lot more net worth than the minorities. Well, let&rsquo;s see here. It isn&rsquo;t rocket science. The old Whites have worked for many years, and Whites were the overwhelming majority. So yeah, they should have a huge golden egg saved up. It&rsquo;s simple math lefty.</p>

<p>&#8220;The news comes as the wealth gaps between whites and minorities grew to their widest levels in a quarter-century&#8221;.</p>
<p>And yet for all the &#8216;investigation&rsquo; and the &#8216;sensitivity&rsquo; of the reporter in regards to the pay-gap, he fails to notice that older people of all races earn more money than do younger people. The people who study race for a living never notice this either, or make this connection, even when talking about it such as here in the article. I guess only sometimes is noting the age difference, demographics, important. </p>

		<p>As the white Baby Boomers age expect many more brutal home invasions as the liberal press stirs up the animosity of minorities and builds justification for street &#8220;redistributive justice&#8221;.  What really stings is that many of these writers are whites.  We really should have had a process of de-communization on our campuses, the press and in our government like the de-nazification that we forced on Germany.  The lefties howl and scream about McCarthy but he barely scratched the surface.  General Chiang Kai Shek was correct the communist are a disease of the heart.  We should have cut them out long ago, now it may be too late.</p>

<p>What they meant is genocide. That&rsquo;s what this is. I can&rsquo;t say that I feel much of anything anymore. In Southern California, White girls and boys, but mainly girls, date, almost exclusively, non-White men. The future of the White race and the various ethnic groups that make up the White race looks really bleak. Perhaps once Whites are gone, this world will devolve into racial warfare, competing for dominance and for the resources and technologies that the White man left behind. </p>

		<p>Which country will step-up and encourage white immigration? It won&rsquo;t be the US. At best, our numbers will dwindle, and maybe there will be an all-out race war. At worst there will be no formal war, but low intensity genocide, the likes of which our brothers and sisters are suffering in South Africa. </p>
<p>Will Russia grow a pair and deal with their muslims and &#8220;oligarchs&#8221;?  It&rsquo;s hard to figure out (or believe) what&rsquo;s going on. No politician can claim ignorance on this matter, though they will. Your average sandal-wearing Californian Marxist may very well be a useful idiot, but those in control understand full well the outcome, and they are EVIL. I used to wonder why we always heard about Hitler (no, I&rsquo;m not a fan) and his body count, but Stalin, Mao, Pot, etc received little attention, despite the fact that Stalin and Mao killed far more people.  I figure it&rsquo;s just the power of Marxism - it&rsquo;s still a very useful ideology in that it&rsquo;s marketable - equality, freedom from oppression; sounds wonderful, right? The problem is that across time and across continents it has failed miserably, leading to mass suffering. It quite honestly does not take human nature into consideration. So why don&rsquo;t people catch on to it? It&rsquo;s like a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. I guess people forget after awhile, and it&rsquo;s allure once again sounds reasonable. </p>
<p>Liberalism, socialism, progressive movements - they are all merely flavors of Marxism. This is the beast that is staring us down. Long story short, I wonder if a former eastern block nation that endured this type of hell will be the one call it for what it is. </p>

<p>Of course, this enormous discrepancy would strike any casual British reader as outrageously unfair. But is it due to racism and discrimination (as they would assume)? No.  Emphatically not! These are black spending habits and characteristic improvidence. </p>
<p>Articles like this never mention that whites spend carefully, shop cautiously, look for bargains,  save what they can, and invest the rest.  Meanwhile blacks spend every penny they make, buy the most expensive frivolous junk, living only from day to day.</p>
<p>The blacks that I have known and worked with were making just as much as I was, yet they were always broke and in debt, while they marveled that I always had money. How did I do it?</p>
<p>White Privilige, obviously!!!</p>

<p>I would not put much stock or faith in these articles which are trying to convince everyone that whites are flocking back to these big cities in any large numbers.   It&rsquo;s all baloney.</p>
<p>What I suspect is the motivation behind those kinds of fairy-tale stories, which I, too, have seen occasionally - is that the cities are becoming desperate because their primary tax base has fled their taxing jurisdiction.  Hence, I think they are deliberately concocting lies and then publishing them - in hopes of tricking Whites into returning to the cities, bringing their paychecks with them, of course.</p>
<p>Please do not fall for this stunt, people.</p>

		<p>There was a saying in the Chicago suburbs where I grew up.</p>
<p>&#8220;White flight is White revenge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let them live in what they create.  </p>
<p>Of course the problem for Whites nowdays is that we have to go so far that we end up in areas where there are no jobs and we have to commute 80 miles each way.</p>
<p>A real problem in the agricultural areas is that the farmers have brought in hordes of hispanic illegals and their offspring who have turned so many small towns into crime ridden hispanic ghettoes. </p>

<p>The hispanics are often recruited and set up for jobs by the restaurants, factories and other businesses that hire them before they even leave their Indian villages in Guatamela and Honduras.  They are part of the labor force the day the van drops them off.<br>

		<p>Most of the net worth of older people is the value of their homes and retirements.  The probably count the amount in the pension fund that middleaged Whites will get when they retire in their sixties. Property is a financial drain until the time comes to sell it.</p>
<p>Supposing the mortgage is paid off in 20 years.  The property taxes are huge and a new roof, furnace, appliances are needed.</p>
<p>Minorities don&rsquo;t live in nasty projects any more.  They, but never, never, Whites get nice homes and family sized apartments through section 8.</p>
<p>I sure wouldn&rsquo;t pay mortgage, property taxes, utilities, and the enormous sums needed to keep a house from falling apart and looking respectable if I could get the same thing for 1/3 of my income.  The 1/3 coming from my welfare check.</p>

<p>Could also be press releases from developers who bought derelict buildings and made them into what they call lofts.  They can&rsquo;t sell them because they&rsquo;re in ghettos.  But they continue to send out press releases hoping to find some sucker who won&rsquo;t notice the neighborhood is a drug infested black crime scene.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s considered racist to say anything, but there is evidence that higher rates of &ldquo;social pathologies&rdquo;, if I can use that term, are found in the cities with higher numbers of minority residents.</p>
<p>Now, the liberals will tell us it is not a causal relationship. But, there&rsquo;s also growing evidence that &ldquo;exurbs&rdquo; or very distant suburbs, as well as small towns, are getting a large number of migrants from major metropolitan areas. And these migrants to exurbs and small towns tend to be middle class or wealthy whites, as opposed to minorities.</p>
<p>In years past, we heard about &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; from our major cities. Now we are seeing &ldquo;white flight&rdquo; from entire metropolitan areas. We&rsquo;ll see what happens in the future, if entire metropolitan areas, not just the central city, reach the &ldquo;tipping point&rdquo; with population change.</p>

		<p>As someone who has lived in both cities, I predict that in 30 years Chicago will be in worse shape than Detroit for two reasons - 1) Illinois is much more of a basket case than Michigan (which is working to dig its way out) and 2) Detroit doesn&rsquo;t have the illegal alien problem that Chicago has.</p>

		<p>My hometown of Birmingham, Alabama certainly saw a change from large majority white population to a city in which the blacks are the large majority and have political control. The whites moved &ldquo;over the mountain&rdquo; to large enclaves there.</p>
<p>As a side note I might mention that I&rsquo;ve been told that in the 1940s and 1950s one could walk downtown at 3:00 in the morning and not worry. The evil Eugene &ldquo;Bull&rdquo; Connor and his police force saw to that.</p>

		<p>96 percent of crime in Chicago is caused by Hispanics and African-Americans. Did you hear about how the superintendent there blamed Sarah Palin&rsquo;s Alaska and the &ldquo;legacy of slavery&rdquo; in Illinois?</p>
<p>All blacks, not just slaves were forbidden to enter Illinois when it became first a territory and then a state.  The illiterate black female affirmative action fool claimed that Sarah Palin was shipping guns to the Chicago blacks and that all the crime in Chicago was caused by this.</p>
<p>Of course this $200,000 per year fool speaks so incoherently it was difficult to understand, but that was the gist of her garbled gabbling.</p>

		<p>Not to worry, section 8 housing will bring the crime to the suburbs and even rural areas.</p>
<p>I wondered why the government AKA fannie and freddie were neck deep in this mortgage mess they and other criminals created until I heard recently they were planning on renting the foreclosures they hold.</p>
<p>Fannie and freddie will now be in the business of redistribution! Renting or giving the foreclosures they hold to the entitlement class as a reward for their future service when needed.</p>
<p>If you think this wasn&rsquo;t planned your too far gone. Just my thoughts, thinking ahead.<br>

		<p>I was born and raised in Buffalo. Western NY is sweet and offers a variety of cultural and sports venues as well as a great lake for swimming and fishing.. but now the city center is a morass of shootings and killings..</p>
<p>I lived in the city most of my life and we never locked a door.. but I fled to the suburbs to get away from the violence that seemed to be closing in on our old Irish /Catholic neighborhood..</p>
<p>I agree with those that point to culture as opposed to skin color.. Our city schools now raise children from the cradle taking care of all medical and social needs..parents need not apply &hellip;</p>
<p>Black mothers weep on TV at the death of their 2nd or 3rd child&rsquo;s death to the street.. so the &ldquo;community organizers&rdquo; have one more vigil against violence ..usually this repeats at least 10 times a year.. no one seems to get that they are the reason for the mess.. the failure to parent their children ..to draw borders..</p>
<p>I feel well gone from a city I love.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;Ethnic minorities now form a majority in eight of America&rsquo;s biggest metropolitan areas, according to new statistics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing new. Over 30 years ago blacks were accusing whites of leaving cities so blacks could move there, then the US would provoke a nuclear war with the USSR and wipe out the blacks.</p>
<p>But it didn&rsquo;t stop them from moving to the big cities.</p>
<p>A few years later blacks accused Whites of inventing the AIDS virus and injecting black babies with it in the maternity wards.</p>

		<p>I recall the term blockbusting from the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s. Basically, real estate developers would hire some blacks to buy into a neighborhood and thereby frighten racist white property owners into selling their property at depressed prices to the developers. </p>
<p>The developers would then turn around and sell the property to blacks at inflated prices and on disadvantageous financing terms.  </p>
<p>Arthur Rubloff real estate company in Chicago was infamous for this.  He would actually recruit criminal blacks, mostly men and house them rent free with instructions to commit crimes and behave in the most thuggish way in public.  Naturally the Whites would flee in droves.</p>
<p>The City of Chicago outlawed for sale signs because of Rubloff and his black thugs.  There were many free speech lawsuits because of this. I don&rsquo;t know if for sale signs are permitted in Chicago even today.</p>

<p>The differences between blacks and other races go far beyond simple surface pigmentation.  Cultures are created by people, not people by cultures.  Black &#8220;culture&#8221; is a disaster because that&rsquo;s all that blacks, as a group, are capable of making.</p>

		<p>I will say what I have been saying for several months now.  I do not know who are enemies are going to be, but I have a feeling our economy is going down the drain.  We Americans, that being White Christian Americans, must start looking on our Calvinist past and start becoming organized to prepare for a major catastrophe as Obama, Biden, the Clintons, the Bushes, the Jacksons, etc. have no idea what they are doing and we must be ready to rule ourseves.  The current crop of Republican lawmakers are unsatisfactory on immigration, political correctness, and race realism.  We must fight back, literally if we have too, hopefully not though.  I do not wish this, but I think we should start to exfiltrate populations from South Africa of Boers, white Rhodesians, those from Denmark, Swedan, Netherlands, Britain, New Zealand and other Anglo Saxon countries for immigration.  We should also think about bringing expat US populations home as they are becoming targets to Latin American crime, Middle Eastern terrorism, and etc.  This would add to our loyal white population that we would need in the United States against our enemies.  </p>

		<p>@ 31. What has happened to us is that &#8220;we&#8221; have let the elites (who run the government) dictate our laws which have allowed minorities a &#8220;leg up&#8221; in practically every venue of our lives. Remember &#8220;school bussing&#8221;? Remember active efforts to integrate neighborhoods? Affirmative Action in hiring? If you look at all of these efforts in totality, it becomes obvious that it is a concerted effort, largely successful, to put the minority populations in control and to displace the White population. </p>
<p>Now we see that virtually all of the major cities in the US are minority controlled. My hope is that technology will make the &#8220;city&#8221; anachronistic. Then we can &#8220;wall&#8221; them off and continue developing our civilization. </p>

		<p>&lsquo;White Flight&rsquo; from U.S. Cities as Minorities Now Dominate Eight of the Country&rsquo;s Biggest Metro Areas </p>
<p>And it is the metro areas that will suffer great losses in the event this country goes into economic depression, which is almost certain to occur.  And, a severe depression will accelerate crime and violence on a grand scale.</p>
<p>This means that urban centers are apt to suffer a loss or curtailment of food deliveries, gasoline and other necessities, while it is entirely possible water borne diseases will contaminate the water supplies, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths besides the ones lost through compromised immune systems due to a lack&hellip;.or scarcity&hellip;.. of food, as well as violent confrontations.</p>
<p>I think it would behoove the PC dregs to discontinue crowing about the increase in minority populations in the big cities, because what they&rsquo;re doing, in effect, is telling those who are knowledgeable about such a situation is that &#8220;minorities&#8221; are going to soon be in a very compromising position.</p>

<p>I think you are mistaken to limit whites to Christian and Calvinism.  The whites we need most are philosophical and educated in the disciplines that actually advanced whites to begin with, not fomented intra-cultural strife and warfare (I mean the religious wars that devastated Europe for a thousand years).  Hair splitters like Calvinists would have whites warring against whites again.  It is going to take a lot of that white IQ to prevent that in any case.  That becomes evident every time I read another poster here writing about white Christian culture as the only Western value and traditions that exists.  The ignorance is staggering and promises the death fo whites who cannot see the whole of the white Western experience and value it.  </p>
<p>A major problem is that Christianity carries with it the seeds of white demise.  This becomes very plain if all you do is read the articles on Amren about the affects of Christianity on for example, the Boer community in SA.  But the proof is everywhere.  I have posted before that what whites need is a war god, not the Christian god, if you need anything beyond the determination to survive as a race. But setting out with &#8220;religious tests&#8221; only guarantees failure.</p>
<p>As for your plans concerning the saving of whites in trouble, you will have to convince them to leave first.  Most seem to feel that SA and Zimbabwe are their homelands, and where their chances for economic advantage still exists, crazy as that sounds to us.  But these grandiose plans speak more to your delusions of power than anything that would be likely to occur anytime soon - or even in time.  It&rsquo;s putting the cart before the horse.  First whites must have an organization that is opened to ALL whites, not just Calvinists.  You are speaking of and to a very tiny percentage of people, which makes any chance for success even tinier. </p>

		<p>We owe nothing to minorities. As a matter of fact they are threatening the continuous existence of Whites and should be summarily deported. But it will not happen until we make it happen.<br>
Forty years ago  from the Bronx,New York,I crossed often into New Jersey for various reasons. All White Towns then.<br>
This year, I went to visit somebody and passed through a Town there called Palisades Park and was shocked at what I saw:<br>
The entire Town almost taken over by Koreans. Banks,Supermarkets,Medical Offices,you name it all Korean. Saw no Whites in the streets except a White Police Officer entering a car. The Whites packed and gone.<br>
All America is going to end up like this. Shame on our traitors in Congress. But we can regroup and fight back.<br>
Actually, I have the only plan for &#8220;Liberation&#8221; which is left to us. It doesn&rsquo;t require any violence. Not at all. I&rsquo;ve been broadcasting it for years and years after finding out that no matter how many millions of letters we write to Congress,nobody will pay any attention to them.<br>
Well, this a tried and true plan: we need to gather a few thousands of courageous White Patriots willing to go to Washington,D.C. The more the better and to shout to those traitors in Congress to get out and be willing to stay there for as long as it takes to bring down this unconstitutional,evil,oppressive Congress. We cannot allow 535 skunks in Congress to destroy us and destroy the future of our own descendants. This is called legally imposed genocide.<br>
Just think,if in only 45 years we&rsquo;ve come down to this, just imagine 45 years  or 100 years from now! Let alone 300 years from now!<br>
There will be no political solution. The Arabs have recently done exactly as I&rsquo;ve been saying for years and they&rsquo;ve won. They&rsquo;ve removed tyrants and still doing it. We can remove our tyrants.It works. It&rsquo;s the only way we can prevail. Will Whites wake up? Well, the late J.B. Stoner,White Activist from Georgia said it many years ago &#8221; Whites wake up before it&rsquo;s too late&#8221;. It seems that it&rsquo;s too late because Whites will probably not wake up and fight for their survival. Or as in Elena Haskins website &#8221; WAKE UP OR DIE&#8221;.</p>
<p>ENEMIES OF AMERICA<br>

<p>Logic concluded that IF most Amrens actually did believed that Whites are superior it is up to the growing soon to be minority majority to believe if is true. Most likely will not; however, if this was in fact truth, then it would be not in the best interest to destroy a soon to be minority as the losses will be bigger then any gains. Of course the trend has been the US has been in decline since those evil o&rsquo; racist days of the 1950s. The standard of living index is proof of that. Multicultural societies do require more resources to maintain some level of peace and harmony. Pluralism usually happens because there is conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>If we where able to build complex societies in places that once only had tribes that is a benefit. The native people got technology they never seen before (medicine, guns, food, resources).</p>
<p>This is what you now have in South Africa. The ANC is now in power and yet the country is receding. Oh yes it is &#8220;our fault&#8221; even after the majority of wealth has been forcefully removed from Afrikaner farmers to a new South African majority and every institution is now Africans based. We know this by the levels of cronyism at different levels of government. </p>
<p>Truly.</p>
<p>Enslavement actually argues for superiority of one group over another  because truly equal persons wouldn&rsquo;t ALLOW themselves to be enslaved/oppressed in the first place. In order to be oppressed there needs to be some sort of disadvantage that the oppressed have and some sort of advantage for the oppressors to oppress.</p>
<p>Would you not agree?</p>
<p>Also while it is true that Anrem &#8220;highlights&#8221; black criminality (just like the NAACP, SLPC, etc do the opposite&hellip;which I&rsquo;m sure you never looked at) the FBI statistics do show that one group commits crime disproportional to the population. Something that you may not understand due to your stratification of thinking (such as: where exceptions negates rules and then trying to find a other commonality that every one shares in which you believe you circumvent your beliefs of generalizations&hellip;but really don&rsquo;t ironically).</p>
<p>The ones who argues against their own interest are of course Caucasians themselves. This because our intelligence to detach from tribal nature which is creative and innovative. However evolution doesn&rsquo;t always award individualism nor intelligence. Groups that have a more collective basis usually come out ahead.  That is why minorities form (mind you, Leftist can&rsquo;t wrap their  head around minority infighting) collective block and population trends follow it.</p>
<p>This hatred that dresses itself in a belief of helping others is due to a different stratification of thinking that bends morality in the form of self flagellation&hellip;even to the point of someone&rsquo;s own survival. </p>
<p>You can just ask Amanda Kijera about that.</p>
<p>Well they can hate all they wan&rsquo;t. But it really comes down to reality. If you truly are right and social constructions are to blame then we should really be seeing improvement from the late 40 years and eventually everyone can celebrate that evil Caucasian people are no more. If it is biological in nature then you may want to pound sand as things will start to reverse as current trends continue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid Sureesh is spot on with his prediction here.  This is the way I&rsquo;ve looked at the 2012 election for some time now: It&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation.  If Obama wins, he and his brazen, vehemently anti-white administration will move forward no holds barred in targeting whites for four more years, with black flash mobs and other open black-on-white attacks bound to become far more commonplace than they&rsquo;ve been this summer.  If Obama loses, blacks riot, loot, burn, vandalize, and target whites.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking to move out of the country before November 2012 as well.  However, I&rsquo;m only 25 and, having been born and raised here, I do not have anywhere to &#8220;move back to.&#8221;<br>

Yes, Sureesh, That is a very good idea, for your safety and that of your family. When whites finally get tired of being victimized by black thugs, dark-skinned Asians may very well account for some of the collateral damage. This will be understandable, but truly regrettable. <br>
I believe that you PERSONALLY are what America traditionally stood for  &mdash;  one of the FEW ethnic immigrants that could and would assimilate, adding that dash of spice to the melting pot. But even your countrymen in the large numbers we are seeing now can and will be detrimental. (Too much spice will ruin the whole stew.)  <br>
Right now and in the very near future we must focus on our own survival and that of our people without the distraction of trying to protect others who have somewhere else to go for safety. This is OUR country  &mdash;  we have no place else to go, you do.   </p>

		<p>Actually, dear sir, East Indians are another race and they are the most racially complicated as they have a population swathe from the Burma and Tibet all the way to Morocco and everything in between Arabia, the Levant, and the Maghreb.  They stop in Sub Saharan Africa and near Kazakhstan with the Western Asian race like the Armenians, Turks, Albanians, Russians etc.  The reason Indians have a lower crime rate than whites is we picked the higher classes to come over here, not the Avars or the Pundits, but the Gujarti Indians.  And there are plenty that do finanial crimes that the relatively self-deserved population of Desi and Pakistanis don&rsquo;t admit to as well as drug trafficking, money laundering and counterfeit cigarettes of the daicot gangs.</p>

<p>reply:<br>
Why did you come to this country? Because you saw better chances for your own betterment and that of your children. If that was not so you would have stayed home in the first place. </p>
<p>In my rural area, where, for a couple of reasons, a lot of tourists come to and pass through, all the motels are in the hands of Indians and Tamils. The little &#8216;gas station country store&rsquo; in our mini village closed down due to old age of the owners.  The new owners are Pakistanis, from what I hear. There were some locals interested, but they could not swing it finacially.  Five miles down the road I walk into a filling station, the owner is a Tamil. <br>
How much help do you get from our own government in very cheap loans and financial assistance to get started in business?  Money from us, the taxpayer, and assistance that the white person wishing to do the same as you, can never get and need not even dream about. <br>
Why do you find it necessary to come here on a regular basis and tell us about your superiour intelligence? You should stay home, where there are problems more than enough and surpassing ours by a long shot. They need your superiour intelligence there. The same goes for all the MDs that have flocked to this countries from India and Pakistan. I have donated money in the past to help feed your hungry and treat your sick. <br>
I do not care what you look like, I wish you well, just stay out of our hair. <br>
AS for wanting to leave now, when the future looks scary, we have a saying, the rats leaving the ship. </p>

<p>If President Obama loses, I believe there will be protests that will turn violent. </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a phrase I use that I believe describes black thinking. &#8220;Once you go black, you&rsquo;re not allowed to go back&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once blacks gain a foothold of a neighborhood, school, city etc, they believe it is theirs forever. Any efforts to change this dynamic is seen as an attack on blacks. It&rsquo;s not a course of natural political change, it&rsquo;s a full, frontal, racist attack.</p>
<p>If President Obama loses, blacks won&rsquo;t see it as an ebb and flow of political groups; they will see it as a racist attack by Whites to &#8216;turn back the clock, bring back Jim Crow, and slavery&rsquo;. This is how blacks think.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t matter how transparent the election is or how decisive the margin of victory. Blacks will see the defeat of President Obama as an attack by Whites who &#8216;can&rsquo;t stand the idea of a strong black man in the White House.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There will be protests and they will turn violent.<br>

		<p>Race exclusiveness will be the demise of America as we know it.  <br>
Post industrial America with the need to sustain its post WW2 economic growth must embrace diversity to take advantage of the untapped human resources within the US and outside. This model was borne out of necessity rather than the &ldquo;Kumbaya&rdquo; nonsense that people concocted. It didn&rsquo;t work because it is flawed.</p>
<p>The flaw of the model was the fact that it assumed that all humans are created equal therefore by providing the right environment, these people will prosper and contribute towards the betterment of the US economy.  This flaw became more obvious as the world economy became 99% globalized and moves towards higher technology with requires not only good work ethics but the smarts to be effective in this economy. The flaw failed to take into account only Europeans(Euro-Americans) and East Asians have the IQ, discipline and work ethics to thrive in this modern economy.(see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations)<br>
One of the main catalyst to this was the &#8220;dumbing&#8221; down of the US educational system to include those that are more suitable to be employed in the low level service industry all in the name of equality. Right now the US is feeling the effects of decades of this &#8220;dumbing&#8221; down with many unqualified people in positions that they have no business to be in. See <a href="http://gcr.weforum.org/gcr2010/" rel="nofollow">http://gcr.weforum.org/gcr2010/</a> where the US global competitiveness ranking is now dropped to fourth. Also notice all the top countries are all Euro and East Asia centric. This forth position can&rsquo;t be sustained as newer generations are less equipped to compete globally.<br>
With the dwindling population of Europeans and in the case of the US, the &#8220;white&#8221; population, to sustain the current economic  status, it will need  talents from elsewhere as the &#8220;white&#8221; population are not enough to maintain the status quo.  </p>
<p>By using race to exclude the rest, if only the &#8220;whites&#8221; are participating in the US economy, the economy will be less than half of what it is right now and the US will not have the economy of scale to project its interests globally.  </p>
<p>The only way is to redesign its current immigration system to only attract those with good value, talents and work ethics from abroad and create an environment where these people feel comfortable to live and raise their families. Inclusiveness should be encouraged but with a difference. Entitlements should be minimized to a level where it will push those on welfare to seek employment because it is not enough. Illegal immigration should be deterred with maximum enforcement. No compromise on the educational system just to include the undeservings who may be integrated into positions which may dilute competitiveness. No quotas on anything.  </p>
<p>In this day and age, one can&rsquo;t feel entitled to a wage 20X more than the world average by just entitlements. One must work harder and smarter.<br>

		<p>40-Anon: I believe your comments, more than most others I have seen, make a great case for segregation or preferably separation.  You make the statement concerning AMREN being a &#8220;reactionary group&#8221;, and follow that with: &#8220;Why on earth would black people NOT hate such a group?&#8221;.  But if Blacks only targeted people belonging to such groups (even those as benign as AMREN), Blacks might actually have some credibility, but they don&rsquo;t.  Blacks are targeting ALL Whites, regardless of belief. We are targeted, by Blacks, solely for the color of our skin. Additionally, as you envoke the &#8220;400 years&#8221; of -past- oppression to give false justification for present criminality, just why would present day Whites want to remain in such a society?  I have asked this before so maybe you can answer: Just when will Blacks be &#8220;even&#8221;? If it is to take 400 years, I&rsquo;m not buying.  If it is to take, as you suggest: &#8220;&hellip;to see whites become smaller and smaller part of the population?&#8221;, I have no desire for that either. Please tell me, for what reason should I want to stay in a nation with a population that includes ANY Blacks? And if you can&rsquo;t think of any reason to remain in a nation with a population that includes any Whites, then please join a Black separatist group and we can begin the discussions for partition. What&rsquo;s that you say?  You&rsquo;re a White person? Fine, but given the historical imperative that multicultural societies move to ever more totalitarianism and eventual self destruction, just where will you go when America falls? Will you join the non-White factions so you can be a &#8220;good White&#8221; and guarantee the extinction of your White heredity, or will you wish to join what by then will be White survivialists? In either case, and specific to your current point of view, thanks for nothing.</p>

Otherwise, while I don&rsquo;t wish to see anyone harmed over the election results, even the thought of any riot situations coming from the 2012 election shows the depth of failure of integration.  If riots do occur, it will be even greater evidence that separation of the races is both desired and needed if we are to maintain a hope of greater peace in the future.  If separation does come to pass at some point, it will also allow Whites to have some sense of survivability for the coming centuries.</p>

<p>Canada welcomes you with open arms, Alexandra! However, if you&rsquo;re considering moving to the Toronto area, think again. Toronto is overwhelmed with black populations from the West Indies and Africa. If your fancy leads you to decide on the Maritime provinces you may find yourself in a neighbourhood in which you are a minority. Many blacks historically inhabit the Maritimes as they are decendents of the passengers from the underground railroad. Vancouver is a beautiful spot, but is over run with Chinese and is the interracial relationship capital of Canada. According to relatives that live in various centres throughout the prairie provinces Koreans are moving in en masse. In short Alexandra, Canada has its own white destruction well under way. Our situation isn&rsquo;t better than that of the USA, but please do move to Canada.</p>

<p>- Correct. I believe that&rsquo;s pretty much what we are working for. If we liked America as we now know it, AMREN wouldn&rsquo;t be in business.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Post industrial America with the need to sustain its post WW2 economic growth must embrace diversity&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>- Ack! 1) We are not anywhere close to maintaining our post WW2 economic growth, nor do we need to, and 2) if we NEED to embrace diversity, then our economic growth pattern doesn&rsquo;t make any difference as it signals the end of the White race in America. (Are you sure you wanted to post on AMREN? Maybe a neocon-globalistic website would be a better place for your comments?)</p>
<p>&#8220;With the dwindling population of Europeans and in the case of the US, the &ldquo;white&rdquo; population, to sustain the current economic status, it will need talents from elsewhere as the &ldquo;white&rdquo; population are not enough to maintain the status quo.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Again, it appears your goal is to maintain the economic status quo for America (regardless of race) which will be impossible given our free trade policy and the rise of China and other nations. Besides, if making such an attempt is destined to fail, why bother? I suggest we do the best we can within our race and work towards racial suviviability. What difference does it make for America to be economically first in the world if there are no Whites around to enjoy it? For that matter, if there are no Whites around, why should we care at all?</p>
<p>&#8220;the economy will be less than half of what it is right now and the US will not have the economy of scale to project its interests globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>- The America of 1940 had roughly 130,000,000 Whites (less than half our current total population, and about 2/3 of the current White population) and we did a pretty good job of projecting our interests globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inclusiveness should be encouraged but with a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I agree in that we should include only White people, as in the long run, nothing else really matters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Illegal immigration should be deterred with maximum enforcement.&#8221;</p>
<p>- When? Now? Forty years ago? Forty years from now?  That train  has already left the station - America&rsquo;s demise as a White majority nation is already certain although not yet complete.  What good is economic dominance in America if America is dominated by some other ethnic group?</p>

<p>Skin color IS a big part of race, and anti white comments I have read in the past from Indians prove it to me, as well as Indian history.

As far as your crime rate goes, it is known to some of us that Indians have been illegally smuggling in other Indians, and that is crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;If race= skin color, why do we dark skinned Indians far so well in a &lsquo;white society&rsquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>You are making more than all whites and yet you write English only this well?  That speaks to the lower expectations for immigrants by employers.  No, you mean to ask why are Indians not receiving the same &#8220;racist&#8221; treatment as blacks?  That is mostly because you segregate in your own communities and are superficially at least, cordial and polite to whites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know some of you are gonna tell me to go back to India because we don&rsquo;t &lsquo;belong&rsquo; in a white society. I&rsquo;m in the process of moving back because I don&rsquo;t want to be here when the November 2012 election results come in. I&rsquo;m afraid when Obama loses, there will be major riots in every major city, so I intend to move back to India before then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anything could happen.  I am not sure how the 2012 election will result.  No one intelligent would predict it this far away.  But whatever happens, this country is going to go through difficult times.  It might even end up like India, with a wealthy elite and a billion poor, starving, filthy, peasants.</p>
<p>But you have taken a lot from us here on Amren posts Sureesh, and I want to give you credit for that.  I don&rsquo;t think we really hate anyone, we just want our own country and racial identity intact.  Everyone else is welcome to theirs, and can be friends on that basis.  Good luck.<br>

<p>You are right but very few Whites will do a darn thing about it. Politics is never the answer, it is the problem. Same with immigration and the Civil rights Act.  Most Whites will never wake up. I have been waiting for decades now for some sign that they will become racially aware but to no avail. If anything, Whites are even more delusional than ever and even tolerant/complacent of being wiped off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>What a race of fools.</p>
<p> One poster above mentioned something about we need a God of war and not the Christian God of peace. Our Christian God is a God of war when it comes to His children. Only the infiltrated &#8220;church&#8221; has preached (deliberately) the opposite for so long that most Whites have fallen for the lie. This is how they brainwashed Whites for eons, by telling them God wants them to love &#8220;everybody&#8221; and spread the gospel to &#8220;everybody&#8221;. Be nice and loving is their motto. Nothing new under the sun. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a better idea:  Let&rsquo;s send any black that even thinks of rioting or assaulting whites a clear message    &mdash;    there will be a VERY heavy price to pay for attacking us, up to and including their very lives.  Blacks cannot be reasoned with, especially if they see the prospects of easy picking from cowering whites,</p>
<p>Now, send them over to my street.  I am sick and tired of the threats and would like to settle this.<br>

		<p>&#8220;One of the reasons suggested for the shift was the ageing of the white population coupled with the relative youth of the Hispanic and Asian populations.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not complete true. Hispanics are young because many of them are first generation immigrants and those tend to be normally young. But author should remember that large percentage of Hispanics are white and they will get assimilated.<br>
Asians however have much lower fertility than whites! Typical Asian family has one child and sometimes two. At the moment East Asian countries ( China, Korea, Singapore ect.) have the lowest fertility in the world. Even lower than Europe. Mexican fertility rate has already reached American level and is bound to continue it&rsquo;s sharp decline. Hispanics in US are following this trend. Countries with lowest fertility rates in the world are China and Cuba. This is the latest trends and there is a danger that lefies in the future will try to import immigrants from poorest and most backward areas like central Africa ect. Fertility rates are most important factor that creates preassures to emmigrate.  </p>

I wanted to address poster #45, Sureesh, about the potential riots from an Obama loss in 12. I&rsquo;ve heard this from other people (all white) and don&rsquo;t really get this. Do people actually believe that if Obama loses (and I, for one, certainly hope he does) blacks will riot in the streets? <br>
I don&rsquo;t mean to change the subject, but I was curious as to what other people think. <br>

<p>Anon @54, since NORTH AMERICA in the state that is akin to what I would call the TITANIC, It will not make any difference who wins this so called FARCE OF AN ELECTION IN 2012!  America right now is literally on fire while the DRACONIANS on WALL STREET AND WASHINGTON, DC dance and play the fiddle.  Look at what is happening in TEXAS &amp; CALIFORNIA with all of these crazy WILD FIRES; look at what&rsquo;s happening with all of these hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes WREAKING HAVOC on the NORTH &amp; SOUTHEAST &amp; MIDWEST; look at this recent EARTHQUAKE TREMOR here in the EASTERN part of the United States!  If this is a HARBINGER of what is to come to the UNITED STATES, this union is FINISHED!  </p>
<p>To be honest, I envy SUREESH because I happen to be a proud black who was born here in NORTH AMERICA with nowhere else to go.  Africa and Haiti   &mdash;   NOT A CHANCE!  JAPAN   &mdash;   FORGITABOUTIT!  So what else is a CONSCIOUS BROTHA like myself to do? Perhaps if things become too unbearable here in the United States(which I am certain they will),I may consider moving to another planet!  Just a thought! </p>

<p>You did great with your post until this last paragraph. </p>
<p>Sureesh just drops by and posts his vitriol for Whites and America and doesn&rsquo;t come back to respond to any comment directed back at him. He is a troll. He is a coward. As for him &#8220;taking a lot from us here on Amren? What a joke. He loves it as long as he can fly by and drop his stuff&hellip; He will flee as soon as there is trouble in OUR land, the land he and his brethren came to take advantage of and make their $$$$ off our backs. </p>
<p>As for &#8220;our hate&#8221;? Do you not ever hate? Do you not ever love? There is a time and a REASON for BOTH. If we do not hate the enemy and fight with fire in our eyes to survive for ourselves and our children, then what are we? We are NOTHING. So I don&rsquo;t even bother with claiming I don&rsquo;t hate because that would be a lie. Of course I hate. Without it, we are sitting ducks ready for the slaughter. Do you fight to the death, those you love? Of course not! </p>
<p>As for wishing Sureesh, &#8220;good luck&#8221;, I have no such desire to wish him anything.</p>

&#8220;Skin color IS NOT race.<br>
 <br>
&#8220;If race= skin color, why do we dark skinned Indians far so well in a &lsquo;white society&rsquo;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Skin color has nothing to do with race.  It is blacks and white liberals who want us to believe that blacks are disliked, because of the &#8220;color of their skin,&#8221; as if that&rsquo;s the only difference between them and every other group, and it is their color which is not liked.  That&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
<p>Blacks are disliked, because they have incredibly high crime rates, they&rsquo;re impulsive and act without thinking more so than any other group, and, as a group, their average I.Q. is 85, which disallows them the ability to compete in first world societies.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint against blacks&hellip;besides their high crime rate&hellip;. is that they constantly use whites as &#8220;whipping boys&#8221; to divert attention away from the fact they fail so greatly and then whine about not being given enough privileges like affirmative action and the like.  They blame whites for their failures when every group in the US outperforms them even though they might come to this country as deprived, dirt poor immigrants who can&rsquo;t speak English.  Blacks are jealous of them and will bully them every chance they get.  Blacks fight with everybody, not just whites.</p>
<p>Some countries restrict black movement, because they cause trouble wherever they go and too many of them are involved in crime.  Some businesses in certain countries bar black patronage, because of their propensity toward crime and violence.</p>
<p>Blacks could be red, orange or white, and they would still be disliked because of who they are, not because of skin color.</p>

		<p>Ask yourself if you see an endgame for all this. Segregation is vigorously pursued  by nearly all whites, as if it were a summum bonum, and simultaneously vigorously condemned by elite opinion. I foresee massive opinion control efforts, and massive disaffection. Coupled with a declining economy, I don&rsquo;t see a concerted unifying effort by the public to counter depression, to move on and eventually to regain lost ground. I can only hope<br>
the fracture amongst us is uncomplicated, and a new political system can set the break.</p>

<p>A few years back a friend of mine who had worked hard at IBM for a decade finally bought his own house in a nice suburban neighborhood of Atlanta.  Within a year, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Section 8 were allowed to give mortgages and to rent out houses on his street, including the one next to him.  </p>
<p>All hell broke loose: extreme noise 24 hours a day, litter, late-night drug deals from cars parked in front of driveways, broken windows, harassment of white residents, and general vandalism ran rampant.  I told my friend what this was  &mdash;  government housing was now available in his neighborhood.  He didn&rsquo;t believe me at first.  Then, he casually asked his neighbor how much he paid to live there and he said it was $600 a month (for a 2,000+ sf home with two stories, three bedrooms, a two-car garage, alarm system, etc.) yet my friend was paying $1600 a month for his identical home.  </p>
<p>People are not only being rewarded for underachieving but while they&rsquo;re in these neighborhoods that they did not work hard to belong in, they destroy them.  It&rsquo;s everywhere now, too.  And it will never end, I fear.</p>

To #50:  This is not a white nation.  We embrace the melting pot and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re great.  Where our leaders messed up is when they took a minority population that had been wronged and went about helping them in all the wrong ways.  Actually, I am surprised you didn&rsquo;t find a lot of #45&rsquo;s comments agreeable.  I surely did, especially the last one where he/she states a plan to leave the country if Obama isn&rsquo;t re-elected.  To a degree, I&rsquo;m actually kind of scared.  Given the neighborhood I currently live in out of economic need, I probably should stock up on food, water, and guns before November 2012 lest my neighbors trash my car and make it impossible for me to leave the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What they meant is genocide. That&rsquo;s what this is. I can&rsquo;t say that I feel much of anything anymore. In Southern California, White girls and boys, but mainly girls, date, almost exclusively, non-White men. The future of the White race and the various ethnic groups that make up the White race looks really bleak. Perhaps once Whites are gone, this world will devolve into racial warfare, competing for dominance and for the resources and technologies that the White man left behind.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
This is an interesting thought. As someone I knew noted years ago in a private conversation, &#8220;We just assume that the orange ball will always get bigger and bigger and higher and higher,&#8221; the &#8216;orange ball&rsquo; being a metaphor for our electromechanical and cybernetic civilization. But there is no guarantee that it will, that this civilization will continue forever even absent the full decline of the European race which created it. It may not. It is not impossible that the world as a whole may return to traditional feudalism.</p>
<p>Under those conditions, only the technologies of the steam engine, the telegraph, rudimentary DC power distribution, ocean navigation (in large wooden ships), cast iron, printing and perhaps the diesel engine would have a chance of surviving. And only in a few places.</p>
<p>Feudalism, fascism and tribalism have been the lot of the human race for time immemorial. For many, even some whites, suffering shorter life spans, drastic population decline, and limited opportunity in life might seem a small price to pay to get rid of the cosmopolitanist masters, in the case of Third World races (sorry, they&rsquo;re not minorities anymore) a small price to pay for getting rid of &#8216;whitey&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A &#8216;world lit only by fire&rsquo; might not be a better world, but there are people who would find it more a comfortable world emotionally. And if that&rsquo;s they way thing go over the next several centuries, what choice would they have anyway?</p>

<p>You should see the Indian control of the medical trade in the inner city where I live.  They took over the whole end of the block on the other side of my alley.  I remember playing in the houses that were there and white friends who lived there.  They tore down one historical wood frame house back in the seventies and put up an ugly brick box and filled in the back yard for a parking lot.  I see them pulling in in their new cars and minivans from who knows where (certainly not around here) and going out at night, but never a peep during the day.  They won&rsquo;t risk or condescend to walking the streets.  Where once there were neighbors who provided company and friendship, and shared their homes and gardens; people whose lives were understandable and similar to one&rsquo;s own - one knew where they worked, what they ate, when they went to bed, what their opinions were - now there are these aliens who couldn&rsquo;t have less contact with their surroundings if they beamed up and down from a spaceship twice a day.  The neighborhood is only good for sucking money out of - tax money syphoned off from the few remaining wage-earners like me and pumped through the hands of the welfare bums who are their patients into the pockets of these Indian vultures.          </p>

Which country will step-up and encourage white immigration? It won&rsquo;t be the US. At best, our numbers will dwindle, and maybe there will be an all-out race war. At worst there will be no formal war, but low intensity genocide, the likes of which our brothers and sisters are suffering in South Africa.</p>
<p>Will Russia grow a pair and deal with their muslims and &ldquo;oligarchs&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s hard to figure out (or believe) what&rsquo;s going on. No politician can claim ignorance on this matter, though they will. Your average sandal-wearing Californian Marxist may very well be a useful idiot, but those in control understand full well the outcome, and they are EVIL. I used to wonder why we always heard about Hitler (no, I&rsquo;m not a fan) and his body count, but Stalin, Mao, Pot, etc received little attention, despite the fact that Stalin and Mao killed far more people. I figure it&rsquo;s just the power of Marxism - it&rsquo;s still a very useful ideology in that it&rsquo;s marketable - equality, freedom from oppression; sounds wonderful, right? The problem is that across time and across continents it has failed miserably, leading to mass suffering. It quite honestly does not take human nature into consideration. So why don&rsquo;t people catch on to it? It&rsquo;s like a wolf in sheep&rsquo;s clothing. I guess people forget after awhile, and it&rsquo;s allure once again sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>Liberalism, socialism, progressive movements - they are all merely flavors of Marxism. This is the beast that is staring us down. Long story short, I wonder if a former eastern block nation that endured this type of hell will be the one call it for what it is. </p>
<p><br>
so why don&rsquo;t people catch on, I tell you why. Because it is the young people and they do not know any better and believe all the jive. And they think they are smart and have a lot of faith,because they go to college or have been there. <br>
White people are their own worst enemy. </p>

<p>- Certainly not now, nor has it been for some time, but it was begun as a White Nation and was meant to be a White Nation.  America will fail because of the policies we have implemented which have brought about the non-White America we have today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We embrace the melting pot and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re great.&#8221;</p>
<p>- No. You and other may embrace the melting pot, but many (including many non-Whites, do not).  Besides, our greatness came pre-1965. Post-1965 has been a steady downfall; it just takes years, even decades for great nations to die once the mortal wound has been delivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where our leaders messed up is when they took a minority population that had been wronged and went about helping them in all the wrong ways.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I can partially agree here, in that to have not helped them at all would have been the least best option.  The other better options include separation, total segregation, or deportation.</p>

<p>We used to do this.  Here in Chicago, we had a so-called race riot in 1919.  Blacks got aggressive on a beach where they were not welcome and whites rose up in righteous anger.  WE rampaged through THEIR neighborhoods, with GUNS, and taught them a lesson!  Guess what - they behaved themselves for the next 46 years!!  I was taught all my life to be ashamed of white violence against blacks.  Now I&rsquo;m beginning to see that at least we whites used to know how to look out for ourselves, and, compared to how sissified we&rsquo;ve become, that&rsquo;s looking pretty good!      </p>

If one kind has adapted an advantage over another group and is more successful in obtaining resources, the disadvantaged kind must adapt and exploit their rival&rsquo;s weakness.

<p>Let me remind you of some History. The Spaniards came to the Americas with Christopher Columbus, an Italian Catholic. Spain, a Catholic Country, conquered the backward Mayans with no more than 500 Spanish Soldiers and several horses.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, Portuguese, Belgians, Germans, French, Dutch, and English didn&rsquo;t need to give up their Christianity to exert their GOD given powers and prowess over the lesser Races. </p>
<p>These dark skinned Races were being &#8220;Civilized&#8221; as best they could be by Whites, the Race that was given Dominion over the Earth by GOD HIMSELF.</p>
<p>Also, remembering the Crusades, which was first called by Pope Urban II, against the invading Muslims in the Holy Land, the Crusading Franks, as they were called, didn&rsquo;t have a pillow fight with the Muslims, but rather, engaged in very bloody warfare.</p>
<p>The Indian, Sureesh, likes to post here often. Does he recall in his Indian history where once a Husband died, and was placed on the funeral pyre, his widow would have to throw herslf onto that same pyre and burn herself to death, because it was believed that once her husband died, her life was over, too? </p>
<p>The Colonial British Governor, the Viceroy, put an end to that native Indian custom. I wonder if the Indian women would like to have their traditional custom back? </p>
