<h1>Cook County Correctional Officer Charged in Girl&rsquo;s Rape</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chicago Tribune, September 22, 20111</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Cook County sheriff&rsquo;s correctional officer has been charged with the 1997 rape of a 10-year-old girl in south suburban Harvey after a DNA test allegedly linked him to the crime, the Cook County state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office said.</p>
<p>The charges stemmed from a 2007 raid by state&rsquo;s attorney investigators and other law enforcement agencies on the Harvey Police Department in which dozens of untested rape kits were discovered and seized, officials said.</p>
<p>Charges against Robert Buchanan, 45, were filed after state&rsquo;s attorney investigators obtained a DNA sample from Buchanan to compare with the DNA originally obtained in the rape kit in 1997 but had gone untested by the Harvey department.</p>
<p>Buchanan was charged with predatory criminal sexual assault. According to prosecutors, he sexually assaulted the child over the course of seven months in the Harvey home where he lived with the child and her mother. In August 1997, the girl told her mother about the assaults, and she was taken to a hospital where a rape kit was taken and semen identified, they said.</p>
<p>The mother contacted Harvey police, who questioned Buchanan but released him without charges and without sending the rape kit to the Illinois State Police Crime Lab for testing, officials continued.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He has been on disability leave from the sheriff&rsquo;s department since November, officials said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, sex assault charges have been brought against 14 defendants in 20 separate cases as the result of testing the rape kits found in the Harvey police station, prosecutors said.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of such bad police, even on those fictional cop shows, and they live to portray the men in blue as bad guys. . Perhaps This one will be shown as &#8216;based on a true story&rsquo; on lifetime network one day. The races will be changed, however. Because sometimes it&rsquo;s Ok to misrepresent the races on TV. </p>
<p>Wonder if this will remain a local news story?  </p>

		<p>The police raid a police department?  I have never heard of such a thing.  Normally that would be big news, but the police dapartment is 77.2% black, 13,6% Hispanic, and 5.7% white so I guess the media will keep this quiet.</p>

		<p>Wonder if the victim is a member of the 5.7% population count as offered by the editor?  If not then should we be interested? Why would we? After all, our concern would be proper only if this is a black on white crime, right?  I mean, why lose focus?</p>

		<p>I bet this case will not get national news coverage because he&rsquo;s black. The dozens of untested rape kits found in this raided police department SHOULD make it national news worthy, but this is exactly the type of incident our media hides per orders from on high. They don&rsquo;t want the sheeple to know how fast their country is turning into a third world latrine.</p>

		<p>The Harvey police department is black run and staffed. You can see the ineptitude, slothfulness and corruption of a black run institution from this one case. How often does one hear of a police department somewhere actually being raided?</p>

		<p>Robert Buchanan? Interesting. The blacks posting on the NY Daily News site were &#8220;offended&#8221; at anyone who suggested that the Buchanan in the below story was one of their own. </p>
<p>BTW, anyone who &#8220;offends&#8221; blacks ends up getting banned from posting, while the worst of the Afrovoodoo race baiters become fixtures there.</p>

		<p> This gentleman is obviously innocent. I mean the rape kits could have been tampered with by anyone with access to them. I don&rsquo;t think he will be convicted of anything no matter how deserving.<br/>
 All he needs is a smart attorney.</p>

<p>I know that this is a rhetorical statement, but I want to use it to illustrate that they notion that white &#8220;men&#8221; will be able to take their rifles and some hunting gear, along with &#8220;a little bacon and beans&#8221; will be able to survive long.  I haven met a number of men here n the Northwest that seem to think a collapse in the US is survivable by heading into the mountains for an extended hunting trip.  It won&rsquo;t work.  It won&rsquo;t work because all they would do is run out of food, find foraging impossible, and likely find competitors who they will end up fighting for survival.  There is no 19th century wilderness where you can carve out an independent living, without interference from anyone else.  The best plan is to locate in white majority regions and prepare your home and neighborhoods for a crisis like CW2 with a viable plan.  You and your neighbors can constitute a veritable platoon of reactive defense.  Fleeing off to some unknown and likely short term survival in &#8220;the wilderness&#8221; is a surrender of your &#8220;castle&#8221; and the last act of the hunted.  Make no mistake about that.</p>
