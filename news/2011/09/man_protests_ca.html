<h1>Man Protests California&rsquo;s &#8216;Mexican Independence Day&rsquo; Celebration</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hill, Stand with Arizona, September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On &#8220;Mexican Independence Day&#8221; in Sacramento, the state capital is routinely turned into a giant Mexican flag for the celebration. Davi Rodriguez of Save Our State did what he so frequently does around California, tows and parks his sign calling for illegal aliens to leave America. That didn&rsquo;t sit too well with the Mexican revelers&hellip;</p>

		<p>I never did understand this. If Mexicans love their country so much, why are they HERE and not THERE? Why are they celebrating a foreign country&rsquo;s holiday here and rubbing it into our faces that they are Mexican and proud of their country?</p>
<p>Could it be that they are racists? Could it be that their own people in government in Mexico despise them because of the endemic racism in Mexico (which of course is never discussed) and practically kick them out?</p>
<p>I say this: If you love Mexico so much, go back and try to create a First World country there instead of being in your face about your hatred towards White America here. All you are going to do is drag America into a Third World status where traditional Americans do not want to go.</p>

		<p>The sign clearly read ILLEGAL mexicans out of the US, so I wonder why the woman they interviewed was so adamant she was &#8220;allowed to be here&#8221;.  She said she was a US citizen, so obviously the sign doesn&rsquo;t refer to her.  Is she so stupid as to not see the distinction, a petty noisemaker, or both?</p>

		<p>Good for him!</p>
<p>If that woman who was interviewed really is a citizen, then the sign did not apply to her!  Can&rsquo;t she read?  It said &#8220;Illegal Mexicans.&#8221;  If she&rsquo;s an American citizen, she should want the illegals out of here just as much as the Save Our State guy does.  Unless&hellip;unless she&rsquo;s a racist who puts her race above being an American and thinks that those who look like her, sound like her, and come from the same place as her, should be above the law?</p>
<p>BTW, I noticed at the beginning of the video, they mentioned something about cleaning up after the party.  Judging from the Mexican neighborhoods I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;ll wager quite a mess was left behind!</p>

		<p>The protester was identified in the video as one Dave Rodriguez. Had his name been Dave Richards, I&rsquo;m sure the altercation would have turned violent and he would have been charged with inciting a riot, if not with a hate crime.</p>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S how stupid it&rsquo;s become.</p>

		<p>The man pulling the sign behind his truck ask if they were afraid of what that sign said. No they are not afraid of that sign. They are frighted to death of that sign. They are scared out of their wits of you and your sign. They are worried that if U.S.citizens see one person like you with the courage to voice your views and stand by your convictions others might also join you and then they would be forced to abide by the law no matter what the main stream media and the crooked politician have to say about them having the same rights as U.S. citizens.They said if they wanted to act stupid and ignorant like him they would knock his sign over and write on it. I must have missed the part where he knocked their signs over and wrote on them.  </p>

		<p>People sure don&rsquo;t like freedom of speech when someone&rsquo;s saying something they don&rsquo;t like to hear. Notice how it&rsquo;s ironically called &#8220;ignorance&#8221; (in Obama&rsquo;s America) to A.) Even be aware of immigration laws, to even know the difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal one and to B.) Show anything that amounts to respect for those immigration laws. My hat off to that gentleman for standing his ground in the face of true ignorance. Ignorance like the woman arguing with him because she was too stupid to realize his statement didn&rsquo;t even apply to her. Ah, the face of America&rsquo;s soon-to-be, new majority! </p>

&#8220;Rubbing it our faces&#8221; is their way of displaying aggression towards us, while calling anyone who objects a &#8220;racist.&#8221; Of course this was all done under the guise of celebrating Mexico&rsquo;s &ldquo;independence.&rdquo; Make no mistake about it, this is how nations behave when they are colonizing another country and this is exactly what the intent was here.</p>
<p>Did I see the rag of Mexico being waived from our own state capital building? I could hardly believe my eyes! But I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised since California is now under the control of La Raza racists and illegal invader sympathizers.  Can anyone guess what message that act of subversion was meant to convey? I bet Mexico was dying to do that!</p>

		<p>Yeah for this guy!  US citizens need to show our offense at this behavior.  This is not Mexico.  I think Mexicans living in US celebrating Mexican holidays are loco. I know many can not read or write.   Right on: if Mexico is so great what are millions doing breaking into US????<br>
Colonies of Mexicans live inside US borders as if still in Mexico.  Courts/judges allow them exception to US laws. Whats up with that??    Mexicans tell me they are my (US) laws, not their (Mexican) laws.   If they are in US they need to know they must meet legal requirements. Borders left open to them send message it is OK to come in and live off US.    </p>

		<p>This was not a celebration; this was a show of force! They took over our capitol building for God&rsquo;s sakes!! I still cannot believe what I saw on that video!</p>
<p>This country is in serious trouble because we are being invaded by mexico and our elected officials are doing nothing about it. In fact, the current president (and many other traitors within our government) are aiding and abetting this invasion! How can people not be deeply troubled by this video!<br>

		<p>Were they celebrating &#8220;mexico&rsquo;s independence&#8221; or the colonization of California? I couldn&rsquo;t tell from that video but if I had to guess, flying the rag of mexico from our capitol building would lead me to believe the latter!</p>

		<p>Always glad to read about events in California that the local media would never think of reporting. If it was in the local news it would be reported in a negative way to show sympathy for the illegal mexicans. Illegal means a crime, these people are criminals and should be treated like it.</p>

		<p>Almost all of the Mexicans who rally together waiving Mexican flags are mestizos. I went to a private Catholic high school in San Diego and almost all of the Mexicans I in my school were White. In school none of these White Mexicans showed obnoxious patriotism towards Mexico.  My White Mexican friends would hardly order a burrito in Spanish, let alone waive a Mexican flag in public.</p>

		<p>I find it insulting that this celebration for Mexican independence was held in Sacramento; at the capitol building no less. I think this just shows how far gone California is. If we intend to keep California, radical changes must be made.</p>

<p>For her the idea that she was &#8220;allowed to be here&#8221; is rationalized by the fact that she wasn&rsquo;t arrested and deported when she was sneaking in.  Then, she may actually be living in a sanctuary city like San Francisco.  She may have been &#8220;allowed&#8221; to get a driver&rsquo;s license via cheating on her written driver&rsquo;s license (I witnessed that activity myself) being coached through her drivers&rsquo; test, getting a job through other Mexicans who have also been &#8220;allowed,&#8221; etc., all makes to her that she has been allowed in.  She doesn&rsquo;t want to be reminded of all the corruption and lawbreaking all this allowing required, especially since this is how business is normally done in Mexico.</p>

		<p>So no mention of how the Mexican Consulate was allowed to commandeer the State Capitol building and raise the Mexican flag?</p>
<p>That women who claims that she is a U.S. Citizen and that she &#8220;works hard to keep it,&#8221; is most likely a liar, and an illegal, since she doesn&rsquo;t seem to know that once you have citizenship, no further work to &#8220;keep it&#8221; aside from not committing crimes, is required.</p>
<p>All the Mexican flag waving in CA has gone on for years and years.  Few ever called it out, so more and more of it came, along with immigrants of any status who are so disloyal as to support a foreign government raising a foreign flag over a U.S. state, even for a minute.</p>
<p>If the nation will not understand the symbolic meaning of such an act it is beyond comprehension.  If it does not act on such a move, it is beyond cowardice and is actually an act of surrender.</p>

<p> What do you mean - &#8220;keep&#8221; California? Where have you been for the last 20 years? We lost California a long time ago. Did you not see the capital building lit up in the colors of the Mexican flag - red, white and green?</p>

<p>I want not only nonwhite illegals out of OUR country, I want all nonwhite legals out also. Reverse that anti-white 1965 Immigration Act and deport most who came under that treasonous act. That Act alone was the beginning of the end of White America, as it was INTENDED to do. Don&rsquo;t most Whites even realize that?</p>
