			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Buley, The Copenhagen Post, September 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Controversial former Aarhus University developmental psychologist and &#8220;intelligence researcher&#8221; Helmuth Nyborg is once again being charged with scientific dishonesty. This time for claiming that immigrants are lowering Denmark&rsquo;s IQ average.</p>
<p>The article, published in April in the British journal &#8216;Personality and Individual Differences&rsquo;, presents a statistical model for how average IQ levels in Denmark will fall steadily over the years as a direct result of immigration from what Nyborg called &#8220;low IQ countries&#8221;.</p>
<p>For documentation Nyborg presented an annuity model based on data from the United Nations and Statistics Denmark on birth rates by country and immigration to Denmark.</p>
<p>But three researchers from Aarhus University and Aalborg University have argued that Nyborg&rsquo;s annuity model is unscientific and twists the facts. They claim, moreover, that he plagiarised it from the work of an economist with connections to the nationalist, anti-immigration organisation Den Danske Forening, reports Information newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a model where you have a completely hypothetical idea that certain [immigrant] population groups have the same birth rates as people in the country they came from. But it doesn&rsquo;t take into account what is known about demographic changes,&#8221; Jens Mammen, a professor emeritus from Aarhus University, one of the three researchers who filed the complaint against Nyborg, told Information.</p>
<p>Besides sloppy science, Mammen and the others have accused Nyborg of outright plagiarism.</p>
<p>They claim that the annuity model in Nyborg&rsquo;s article was actually created by JÃ¸rn Ebbe Vig, who they claim is an economist and statistician for Den Danske Forening.</p>
<p>Den Danske Forening does not publish the names of its members or leadership, but its website claims, in English, that its objective is &#8220;to safeguard Danish culture, language and traditional lifestyle&#8221; and &#8220;to warn against the dissolution of our cultural identity which is now under threat of being swamped by an enormous influx of immigrants from countries plagued by overpopulation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Vig denied being the association&rsquo;s economist and statistician, but admitted that he had done work for it.</p>
<p>At first Nyborg denied that he had used Vig&rsquo;s annuity model. And both Vig and Nyborg rejected the plagiarism allegation; Vig even countered that he had borrowed Nyborg&rsquo;s language and data for his research, not vice versa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have talked with him about the method he uses and how he uses it, and in that way we have talked about things. I think it is just fine if he copies everything I have said and vice versa. That&rsquo;s what research collaboration is,&#8221; Nyborg told Information.</p>
<p>But when Information presented Nyborg and Vig with dated, comparative excerpts from each of their writing that appeared to show that Nyborg copied Vig, Vig admitted that Nyborg had indeed paid him for &#8220;consulting work&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of retrieving relevant data from Statistics Denmark, and how they should be extrapolated to produce a broad-based weighted average for birth rates and IQ data, I advised Helmuth Nyborg in exchange for payment,&#8221; Vig told Information.</p>
<p>Mammen and two other colleagues from Aarhus University and Aalborg University have reported Nyborg to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (UVVU). They claim that, at the very least, Vig should be named as a co-author on the paper.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Nyborg has been reported for scientific misconduct.</p>
<p>In 2007, he retired from Aalborg University after failing to produce documentation for findings he claimed proved that men are more intelligent than women, reports Politiken newspaper. Nyborg had published articles in 2002 and 2003 describing an original study on intelligence and gender that he claimed showed that men were more intelligent.</p>
<p>In 1996, he published research claiming that white people are more intelligent than black people.</p>
<p>In connection with Nyborg&rsquo;s latest publication, Mammen and his colleagues claimed that he had not only damaged the international reputation of Danish research, he had also misled the public at home.</p>
<p>For example, Nyborg&rsquo;s conclusions were recently cited in articles in the newspapers Jyllands-Posten and Weekendavisen in articles about immigration. In the Weekendavisen article, Nyborg was identified as an &#8220;intelligence researcher and former psychology professor&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s dishonest that the research or the researcher&rsquo;s title and authority are being misused to promote political views. People are allowed to have political views, but it is dishonest if they are presented as though they are scientifically substantiated,&#8221; Mammen told Information.</p>
<p>The UVVU declined to comment as the case against Nyborg is still pending.</p>

<p>Now when the white man seeks to demote the women of his own race then he is trying to disempower the white race&hellip;the true white racers know that the main reason the white man has become defunct is because he has allowed himself to be manipulated into a place whereby he will turn on the women of his own race knowing full well that white women and white men united can never be destroyed&hellip;it is only where the white man and white woman can be divided that they are destined to destroy themselves&hellip;simple.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s how you know Nyborg is 100% right in his claims about IQ differences: the p.c. brigades haven&rsquo;t even attempted to debunk any of his claims.</p>
<p>Instead they level a bogus plagiarism charge against him and challenge him on a minor issue dealing with immigrant birth rates.</p>

		<p>The survival of the Western World greatly depends on the quality of the population that is let in.  Unfortunately, the Western countries have allowed itself to be bound by the make believe badge of not wanting to be perceive as &ldquo;racists&rdquo;.  This one word &ldquo;racism&rdquo; has derailed the white population off it tracks in the search for truth that not all races are created equal.  Some people like geneticist Spencer Wells keeps insisting that the human race evolved from blacks and out of Africa.  This is a make believe theory that was spun by chance physical findings by Leaky.</p>

		<p>Such charges and counter-charges are hardly new among scientists, and the anti-&#8220;racist&#8221; crowd have by far the worse record; Roger Pearson&rsquo;s books told only part of the story.</p>
<p>As for Out of Africa, the propaganda aims to suggest that all humans have blacks as ancestors, but then evolution would anyhow suggest that all humans (including blacks) have ape-men of some sort as ancestors.  The response should be: Are the white and yellow races outside Africa therefore &#8220;more evolved&#8221; than the black races still left there, and if so in what respects?  What is the anti-&#8220;racist&#8221; answer to that? </p>
<p>The response from Nyborg and others in similar positions should be to admit obtaining information from other people, affirming that it seemed reliable, and say: so what?  The &#8220;standards&#8221; demanded of &#8220;scientific racists&#8221; are far more demanding than those of the egalitarians, but this should be accepted, since absolute scrupulousness puts the former on an unassailable high ground.<br>
It would seem mathematically miraculous if all population groups on the planet manifested identical average intelligence scores and identical Bell curves; a point made ages ago in another way in a UNESCO paper by G. M. Morant.</p>
<p>Quite reasonable to hold that different human populations develop different intellectual/nervous system responses to different environments; e.g. Bushmen hunting skills.</p>
<p>Why should evolutionary adaptations suddenly cease, or become completely trivial, after hominids entered the Sapiens stage?</p>
<p>Not entirely irrelevant is this quotation from David Robson, in the New Scientist, September 24, 2011, p.45:</p>
<p>&#8220;David Geary at the University of Missouri-Columbia, for one, believes that once complex societies developed, the less intelligent could survive on the backs of their smarter peers, whereas in the past, they would have died - or at least failed to find a mate&hellip;. Many studies have found that the more intelligent people are, the fewer children they tend to have&hellip;. This evolutionary effect would result in a decline of about 0.8 IQ points per generation in the US if you exclude the effects of immigration, a 2010 study found&hellip;.we have no way of knowing the challenges that humanity will face over the next millennia.  But if they change at all, it appears likely that our brains are going to keep &#8216;devolving&rsquo; - unless, of course, we step in and take charge.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is amazing how far the Leftists will stoop to create a tempest in a teapot out of nothing.</p>
<p>Normally, it is the offended author whose work was stolen who brings charges of &#8220;plagiarism&#8221;.   In this case, the two authors worked together, knew each other,  and are in greement with each other. Neither one is complaining.  It is a THIRD PARTY who is bringing charges of plagiarism, against both their denials.  Simply amazing!</p>

<p>You have it exactly wrong.  It is White women who since 1970 have sought and been rather successful in destroying the White race.  You should know the detrimental effects of the entire feminazi movement.  White men not hired or promoted because they are White.  School textbooks eliminating White men in favor of non White women.  White female anti rape crusaders who make a good living from goverment grants covering up the fact that blacks and hispanics commit most of the rapes in this country.</p>
<p>The list of attacks on the White race by White women goes on and on. The White female leadership is nothing but female versions of Tim Wise.  A few of us try to stem the tide, but most White women are just too brainwashed and stupid to see the truth about race relations.<br>

		<p>Denmark is in many ways an exemplary country, but its universities are micromanaged. University administrators presumptuously claim the right to direct the research of faculty members  &mdash;  a stance that would provoke outrage in Anglo-American universities. </p>
<p>Nyborg has problems beyond this, though, in that his research is in a field that political correctness would love to shut down. And most Danes, face it, are just much more politically correct than most of us. </p>

 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
An assertion like this ought be able to prove or disprove by comparing IQ averages in the past with those now in Denmark, and by comparing the IQs of immigrants with those of Danes who have lived in Denmark for as many generations as there is record.<br>
 <br>
Because those who pretend that the races are innately equivalent cannot prove their theories with facts, they try to silence those who have the courage to tell the truth. </p>
