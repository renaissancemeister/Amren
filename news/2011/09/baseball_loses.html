<h1>Baseball Loses Allure for African-Americans</h1>
					
					<p>Terry Foster, Detroit News, August 30, 2011</p>

<p>Interest in playing and watching baseball has seen an alarming decline in African-American communities. Experts blame the economy, the decline of the African-American family structure, the sparse marketing of current players and even video games.</p>
<p>The result is evident on every Major League Baseball team including the Tigers, where center fielder Austin Jackson and newly acquired Delmon Young are the only black players.</p>
<p>Only 8.5 percent of Major League players are African-American. That&rsquo;s down from 10 percent in 2010 and the lowest number since 2007, according to Richard Lapchick&rsquo;s Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports at the University of Central Florida.</p>
<p>In 1997, during the 50-year anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking baseball&rsquo;s color barrier, league rosters were 17 percent African-American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One shining light is MLB&rsquo;s Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) program, which began 22 years ago. More than 1 million youths across the country have gone through the program, including 171,000 in 2010. MLB teams have drafted 171 RBI players, including Carl Crawford, Dontrelle Willis and Justin Upton.</p>
<p>About 47 percent of participants are African-American. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not just a problem; it&rsquo;s a crisis,&#8221; New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia told the Associated Press about the lack of blacks in baseball.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Baseball experts say inner-city baseball has been hurt by the sluggish economy. The money just hasn&rsquo;t been there to buy equipment. Sponsorships have declined. The Eagle Sports Club charges $45 per child, which includes the cost of the uniform, but also offers help to those who can&rsquo;t afford it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But back in the 1940s, blacks did not feel comfortable going to games because white fans made it clear they weren&rsquo;t welcome. Those that did attend often sat in the lower-deck bleachers at old Tiger Stadium and rarely took their sons or daughters.</p>
<p>That is one reason African-American attendance remains low.</p>
<p>Former Tigers center fielder Curtis Granderson, for instance, challenged his Yankees teammates to find more than 10-15 black fans in the stands.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first it starts off as a joke,&#8221; Granderson told the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. &#8220;So after a while it becomes: See, told you so.&#8221;</p>
