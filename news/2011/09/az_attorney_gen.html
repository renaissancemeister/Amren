			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Hill, Stand with Arizona, September 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While Gov. Rick Perry (R-TX) has engaged himself in a (futile) effort to convince the 81% of Americans who oppose in-state tuition for illegal aliens they are wrong  &mdash;  and heartless, Arizona is making sure no schools can offer this disgraceful subsidy.</p>
<p>Arizona&rsquo;s legislature first tried to ban in-state tuition for illegals in 2005, but then-Gov. Janet Napolitano vetoed the bill. So the very next year, voters overwhelmingly (71%) approved Sen. Russell Pearce&rsquo;s Proposition 300 to ban the practice at state schools.</p>
<p>But some state community colleges, such as the Maricopa County Community College District, attempted to skirt the law by allowing illegal immigrants to continue to qualify for in-state tuition as part-time students.</p>
<p>So Senate President Pearce and Sen. Linda Gray asked Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne for his legal opinion on whether MCC could get away with this trick to benefit illegals  &mdash;  and yesterday Horne said no way. State law clearly bars community colleges from granting illegals in-state tuition under any circumstances.</p>

		<p>Arizona, a state that the left has been working overtime on labeling everything from Nazi like to Hillbilly idiots, is in fact NOT. It is simply a state that is actually following existing United States immigration law. It is the left that are in a state of criminal behavior, because they are aiding and abetting foreign nationals here illegaly.</p>

		<p>While on the topic of Republican Presidential candidates, in an article in Business Weak (sic) magazine about New Jersey Governor Krispy Christie in St. Louis for a mutual fundraiser for the NJ and Missouri RINO statewide establishments in both states, it stated in passing that one of the co-founders of Homespanic Depot (the hardware store) is urging Krispy Christie to get in the race.  Now, Homespanic Depot is the store that brought the world the &#8220;day laborer&#8221; phenomenon, so you know what a Christie Presidency would be all about, amnesty and open borders.  Since this fundraiser was also for Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Ann Wagner, that spoke volumes about her, for those of you locals for whom this concerns.  Vote Akin.</p>
<p>As a coincidence, if you ever notice these big box farms (aka &#8220;Commons&#8221; shopping centers), you&rsquo;ll notice that most of them have Wal-Martinez and Homespanic Depot, and maybe a Santo&rsquo;s Club for good measure.</p>

		<p>In an age where common sense seems so uncommon, it&rsquo;s heartening to see that AZ is one place that hasn&rsquo;t lost its mind. </p>

		<p>To all who are here with their illegal parents, which makes you illegal also - a college education in Mexico is free. How about taking them up on it? Then stay there and teach the ninos that it isn&rsquo;t nice to break into other people&rsquo;s country, Or, at least, go south for a change. We&rsquo;re full up in el norte.</p>

<p>That is frequently true in NJ as well.</p>

		<p>My wife is an English teacher at a community college in San Diego.  Her students are mostly Mexicans who enroll in the minimum required units to qualify for financial aid which they will never pay back.  She teaches 2 sections of ESL (not by choice) with over 40 students mostly illiterate and 1 section of remedial English which is also largely Mexican.</p>
<p>While the actual cost of instruction per capita to the taxpayer is cheaper than the State Universities, there is more abuse occurring in community colleges. At least at the University level, completely lost causes and illiterates are somewhat filtered out. However, at a CC any Mexican can hop the fence, enroll in courses, and start receiving his goodies.</p>

		<p>How is illegal status determined?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember ever showing proof of citizenship to attend college.<br>
