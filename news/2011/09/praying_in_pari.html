			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry Samuel, Telegraph (London), September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Claude Guéant said that ban could later be extended to the rest of France, in particular to the Mediterranean cities of Nice and Marseilles, where &#8220;the problem persists&#8221;.</p>
<p>He promised the new legislation would be followed to the letter as it &#8220;hurts the sensitivities of many of our fellow citizens&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;My vigilance will be unflinching for the law to be applied. Praying in the street is not dignified for religious practice and violates the principles of secularism, the minister told Le Figaro newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;All Muslim leaders are in agreement,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>In December when Marine Le Pen, then leader-in-waiting of the far-Right National Front, sparked outrage by likening the practice to the Nazi occupation of Paris in the Second World War &#8220;without the tanks or soldiers&#8221;. She said it was a &#8220;political act of fundamentalists&#8221;.</p>
<p>More than half of right-wing sympathisers in France agreed with Marine Le Pen, at least one poll suggested.</p>
<p>Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s party denounced the comments, but the President called for a debate on Islam and secularism and went on to say that multiculturalism had failed in France.</p>
<p>Following the debate, Mr Guéant promised a countrywide ban &#8220;within months&#8221;, saying the &#8220;street is for driving in, not praying&#8221;.</p>
<p>In April, a ban on wearing the full Islamic veil came into force. Holland today became the third European country to ban the burka, after Belgium, despite the fact fewer than 100 Dutch women are thought to wear the face-covering Islamic dress.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr Guéant said the prayer problem was limited to two roads in the Goutte d&rsquo;Or district of Paris&rsquo;s eastern 19th arrondissement, where &#8220;more than a thousand&#8221; people blocked the street every Friday.</p>
<p>However, a stroll through several districts in Paris on a Friday suggests that Muslims spill into the streets outside many mosques.</p>
<p>Under an agreement signed this week, believers will be able to use the premises of a vast nearby fire station while awaiting the construction of a bigger mosque.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could go as far as using force if necessary (to impose the ban), but it&rsquo;s a scenario I don&rsquo;t believe will happen, as dialogue (with local religious leaders) has born fruit,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sheikh Mohamed salah Hamza, in charge of one of the Parisian mosques which regularly overflows, said he would obey the new law, but complained: &#8220;We are not cattle&#8221; and that he was &#8220;not entirely satisfied&#8221; with the new location. He said he feared many believers would continue to prefer going to the smaller mosque.</p>
<p>Public funding of places of religious worship is banned under a 1905 law separating church and state. Mr Guéant said that there were 2,000 mosques in France with half being built in the past ten years.</p>
<p>France has Europe&rsquo;s largest Muslim population, with an estimated five million in total.</p>

		<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t that Muslims pray in the streets, but that Muslims are in the West, period.  If they were in Saudi Arabia or Iran or wherever, I would not care where they prayed. It&rsquo;s that Muslims are an invasive group bent on the destruction of the West and the subsequent replacement of Western societies by their own Islamic culture that has always been the problem.  Sadly, France has moved from being a defender of the West to a nation that is taking the lead in its down fall.</p>

At least here, they have left the sidewalks and crosswalks clear.</p>
<p>But what kind of damn fools would crouch down on their knees in the middle of the street with their face on the pavement?  What kind of mass lunacy is this? Are these rational beings???</p>

		<p>On one hand, Paris should be congratulated on this step of cultural self-assertion. On the other hand, echoing what another poster has said, this is a band-aid solution that does not address the fundamental problem which is that there are Muslims in the heart of Europe to begin with. And five million of them, no less. France has taken some bold steps lately to assert itself in the face of the Muslim invasion (and that of the Roma, too), but it may be too little too late. France has, in one form another, been a center of Western civilization for at least 1400 years. If it is lost to Allah&rsquo;s hordes, then all of us as Europeans (on or off the Continent) will suffer for it. Let&rsquo;s hope that the NF can make some electoral gains in the near future so that France&rsquo;s current trend toward self-preservation can be continued with even more gusto.</p>

		<p>If only we could do this here.  In NYC I know of one mosque where you can&rsquo;t pass on Fridays.  The street is that crowded.  There has got to be a law or ordinance against this.  I can&rsquo;t see any other group getting away with this.  Well, not a group of Americans of European blood anyway.</p>

		<p>It may have started innocently enough, but it became an issue of power: Muslims were observed leaving their own districts and local Mosques to go to these ones where they knew there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough room and they would have to go out into the Street. And once you take the street, you are half way at least towards taking the Country.</p>

The really sad part is that you shouldn&rsquo;t be in this situation to begin with, nor did this government have the right to impose this nonsense on the native population without their consent. But really, who am I to talk about France when our own government is doing the same thing to us here in America, no matter how hard we object.</p>

		<p>The French nation today, by allowing Muslim immigrants to come and increase their numbers, is just as bad as the Vichy puppet government that collaborated with the Nazi occupiers in WW2.</p>
<p>Outlawing praying in the streets of Paris is a step in the right direction.  But Muslims do not belong in France, Germany, Great Britan, Austria, Sweden, or any other European nation.</p>
<p>la mere&rsquo;, you are right.  If would be a horrible tragedy for the Mona Lisa to be destroyed if Muslims take power in France!</p>

		<p>Much of what Moslems do in the West is power-playing.  They intentionally break rules regarding head coverings, for example, in order to file a lawsuit.  If the defendant gives in or loses, then that&rsquo;s another step toward Moslem dominance.  They&rsquo;re often overtly provocative, daring Westerners to call them on it.  If the latter does, then they cry discrimination and go to the courts.  And, of course, the MSM is their biggest asset.<br>
Whether we can directly get rid of Moslems through laws is, for now, questionable.  One thing nations can do, however, is pass measures that make them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.  Obviously, anti-burkha/face veil laws, ordinances against street prayer, and strong European borders are such measures.  Severe restrictions on welfare, particularly in the U.K., would also help.</p>

The Nazi occupation is starting to look pretty benign by comparison. With the exception of the country&rsquo;s Jewish population, the Vichy regime didn&rsquo;t damage France or the traditional French way of life to nearly the extent that five million Muslims are capable of doing.</p>

		<p>Looking at that picture just really, really bothers me. They have no right at all to block those streets. That is just so rude and innapropriate. They would never have dared try a stunt like this if there were only a few thousand muslims in France. Their numbers have emboldened them. As Enoch Powell said &#8220;Its all about the numbers&#8221;. I fear France has reached the tipping point.</p>

<p>Yes, it is. Those Muslims also know that public demonstrations of that sort are impopular and that therefore they bother the authorities.  They pray outside in the aim to speed up the granting of new grounds to build their places of worship. Islam was founded by a stateman so it is intrinsically political.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t even like the idea of Muslims settling permanently in the West (or in non-Muslim nations as well), but if they are going to be in the West for whatever reason, praying should only be done in their homes or in their mosques. </p>

		<p>Point of information (and I sympathise with many of the views above).  The number of Muslims in France have expanded out of proportion to the number places in mosques available when they have their services.  That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see them doing this in places with loads of mosques.  I&rsquo;ve seen people standing outside at Christian services in Italy and Ireland.  You&rsquo;d think many AmRen subscribers would at least approve of the devoutness to God this behaviour represents, which is a point of similarity between them and (some of) us.  Personally, I wish the world was secular.  </p>

		<p>Is any AR reader familiar with this street in wherever it is? Which direction are they oriented if you know? Also, all muslims DO NOT pray 5 times a day, in cases in the West, it is done, as pointed out, to display power and disdain for the infidel laws which, according to the muslims, do NOT apply to them. I have 17 Afghan local muslims that work for me here in Afghanistan and they pray once in our 12 hour shift.</p>

<p>It appears to be in Paris. It is obviously in an Arab district, judging by the store names.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but I would guess it might be the Rue de la Goutte-d&rsquo;Or [Meaning: &#8220;Drop of Gold&#8221; St.], on the north side of Paris, near Montmartre. (Subway stop: Chateau Rouge]</p>
<p>Here on the lower slopes of Montmartre, long before Paris became so large, there were once vineyards where was grown a vine producing a renowned wine called &#8220;Drop of Gold&#8221;. During the Middle Ages, up until the mid-1500&rsquo;s,  the City of Paris annually presented to the King four  barrels of this precious wine. </p>
<p>Little could those crusader kings of the Middle Ages  have imagined what the area looks like today! And what the French have let their country become.</p>
<p>It is even worse if you go to the nearby suburb of St. Denis, where the  ancient Basilica of St. Denis, resting place of French monarchs for well over than a thousand years, is now surrounded by a squalid, raucous Arab casbah.  (I wonder when the kings will be thrown out and it will become a mosque?)</p>

<p>Those are ITALIANS and IRISH standing outside sir. In Italy and Ireland, Italians and Irish have complete freedom to do whatever they want. (And I doubt very, very much they would be blocking the streets in such a way as the photo shows those muslims doing.) Muslims in Italy and Ireland, or in this case, France, HAVE NO SUCH RIGHTS, OR PRIVILEGES. Islam, in any case, is not a &#8220;religion&#8221; or about &#8220;spiritual growth&#8221; but is a totalitarian cult-like way of life, totally alien to western society. And muslims are pulling stunts like this to make a point and send out a point. It is an &#8220;in your face&#8221; gesture.</p>

		<p> &#8220;You&rsquo;d think AmRen subscribers would at least approve of the devoutness to God this behaviour represents which is a point of similarity to them and (some of) us.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Are you nuts?  I don&rsquo;t consider that &#8220;devoutness to God&#8221;,  I consider prostrating yourself in the middle of the street sheer idiocy.  What does that have to do with God or religion?</p>
