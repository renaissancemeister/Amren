			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>My Fox Boston, September 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Police arrested an illegal immigrant for Operating Under the Influence. It&rsquo;s his 6th offense, something he&rsquo;d been deported for previously.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>AIFS identified him as Eduardo Torres. The 48-year-old was living in Marlborough.</p>
<p>It was determined that Torres was a previously deported fugitive wanted by Homeland Security and ICE. Torres has five previous OUI convictions, three in California and two in Massachusetts. He later failed a Breathalyzer test.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This arrest comes on the heels of controversy over another illegal immigrant who is accused of drunk driving and hitting and killing a young Milford man.</p>

		<p>It would be useful to find out how this guy keeps getting back in the US.  People keep claiming that we don&rsquo;t need a fence but my guess is this guy simply walks across the border and takes a bus (or drives).  What ever it is we are doing it isn&rsquo;t working.</p>

		<p>This story beggars belief.  Any normal citizen with five DUI convictions would be languishing in state prison under a sentence of several years.  And this illegal just gets turned loose?</p>

		<p>In Texas this sort of thing is an epidemic. How many more times are we going to deport this guy? I so sick of this kind of crap. Rick Perry?? NO WAY!!</p>

I suggest, as a man, as a white man of years, that you do not use that word here.<br>
I am aware of the musical group of that name.<br>
You are using a racial slur against whites in a group of whites who value their race above all.<br>
Perhaps you mean no harm. <br>
I am saying it is degrading for amy white man to use, or accept that term, here, or anywhere.</p>

		<p>Uncle Cracker!!! Roger that to your attitude to Perry. He LOVES illegals and muslims, no way is he fit to be president, we&rsquo;d be better off to bring Manuel Noriega out of hiding and elect him, he didn&rsquo;t put up with illegals and wouldn&rsquo;t put up with muslims either I dare say.</p>

		<p>My friend in Arizona was nearly killed when a drunk illegal alien drove through a red light and hit the taxi she was in. He had no drivers licence and no insurance, and his only punishment was deportation. She was left with thousands of dollars worth of medical bills and no way to pay them. How is that fair?</p>

		<p>This guy doesn&rsquo;t survive on pixiedust and starshine or live with the smurfs in smurf village.  And I seriously doubt he is an independently wealthy millionaire.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s obtaining welfare illegally.  Obeying simple laws requiring proof of identity would make what he is doing impossible.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s way past time we made aiding and abetting an illegal by state employees, a felony.  It would solve most of the problem and shut down any debate about &#8220;sanctuary cities&#8221;.  Give welfare to one of these guys, do 20 years in prison with them.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>

		<p>I live on a corner lot in a census block that is 40 percent Hispanic.  I have to go out weekly and pick up the flattened cans of Modelo from my lawn and a couple times a year have to repair it because every so often someone takes the turn a little too wide and does a serious lawn job in my yard.  Always in the middle of the night.  Isn&rsquo;t too much of a stretch to assume it&rsquo;s the Modelo drinkers.</p>

		<p>Personally, I fear we will never get a handle on illegal immigration when it comes to non-whites because if it&rsquo;s tried in any way, whites will be accused of racism, and that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.  The same goes for curtailing welfare or any other entitlements or public assistance that is being received, legally or illegally, by any minority.  I wish I knew an answer.  I also wish I knew how far it&rsquo;s going to have to go before our backs are broken.  Even the president has two illegal (at least two) immigrant relatives in the country and nothing will be done about them despite the fact that they and their locations are known.  Black president?  Free pass.  It&rsquo;s the same for all minority criminals.  They would rather come here and break the law and risk incarceration or deportation than just sit in their own countries and make something decent, or at least law-abiding, of themselves.</p>

		<p>Oh, about that &#8220;Milford man.&#8221;  His name was Matthew Denice and he was 23 years old, a recent graduate of Framingham State University.</p>
<p>Matthew was not killed instantly. A drunk driving illegal alien smashed into his motorcycle and dragged him for a quarter mile despite bystanders pounding on the vehicle and screaming for him to stop. Guaman finally did stop &mdash; when his pickup ran off the road, after which he backed up over Denice who had become dislodged, and then sped off.  Oh, an Guaman had his six year old son in the truck with him.</p>
<p>Brenda Walker writes on VDARE.com:</p>
<p><i>The driver, Ecuadoran Nikolas Guaman, is a career criminal with a long rap sheet. including assaulting a cop, who has been protected by Massachusetts&rsquo; sanctuary policy and its ardent defender, Gov. Deval Patrick. The Governor has fought against the common sense provisions of the federal Secure Communities policy because he apparently cares more about foreign lawbreakers than public safety for innocent Americans.</i></p>
<p>Got that citizens of Massachusetts?  Your governor believes protecting the &#8220;rights&#8221; of illegal aliens is more important than protecting YOU against foreign criminals</p>
<p>Patrick stated the following about this case:   <i>Illegal immigration didn&rsquo;t kill this person. A drunk driver killed this person, and we have laws about that.</i></p>
<p>We have laws about illegal immigration, Mr. Patrick, that you continue to ignore.</p>
<p>Time to vote this one OUT!!</p>
