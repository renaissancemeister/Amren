<h1>David Yeagley Sues Thugs Who Shut Down 2010 AR Conference</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>AR Staff, American Renaissance, September 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The American Renaissance conference planned for February 2010 had to be <a href="/ar/2010/04/index.html">cancelled</a> because three successive hotels that had agreed to host the conference were intimidated by &#8220;anti-fascist&#8221; thugs. We are pleased to learn that one of the speakers scheduled for the conference, <a href="http://www.badeagle.com/">David Yeagley</a>, has filed suit against the &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; on charges of conspiracy and tortious interference with contract. </p>
<p>It is high time that the shameless attacks on our right to assemble got the response they deserve. Joe Sibley of the Houston, Texas, firm of <a href="http://www.camarasibley.com/">Camara and Sibley</a> is lead counsel in the case.</p>
<p>David Yeagley, the great-great-grandson of the legendary Comanche chief Bad Eagle, has filed charges in Oklahoma state court against Jeffrey Imm, Daryl Lamont Jenkins, and several other &#8220;John Doe&#8221; defendants whose names will be added to the suit as their identities become known. </p>
<p>According to Dr. Yeagley&rsquo;s complaint:</p>
<blockquote>These Defendants and their co-conspirators contacted hotels retained to host Plaintiff&rsquo;s speaking engagement and used threats of murder, violence, and other tactics to induce those hotels to breach their contractual agreement to host Plaintiff&rsquo;s speaking engagement. These terrorists must now be brought to answer for their actions &hellip; .</blockquote>
<p>He adds the following about the defendants:</p>
<blockquote>While their monikers and supposed ideologies may differ, there is one thing they all have in common: They will use any means necessary, including violence and threats of violence, to stop those whom they disagree with from associating and expressing their views.</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Yeagley is seeking monetary damages for the harm he suffered because of the cancelation, in addition to &#8220;unlimited punitive damages&#8221; and &#8220;such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Yeagley is an accomplished musician, composer, author, and political commentator. His commentaries on American patriotism have so infuriated a few liberal Indians that some have accused him of being an imposter and not really an Indian. </p>
<p>When asked about his decision to sue, Dr. Yeagley replied, &#8220;It is my cultural and traditional duty to defend my nation. America is my adopted nation, and it is an honor to defend her freedoms. Our freedoms are imperiled by the actions of what amount to liberal racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being a plaintiff in a lawsuit is very burdensome and time-consuming, and we are gratified that Dr. Yeagley has taken this decisive step. Dr. Yeagley is by no means a wealthy man. He manages a small, 501(c)3 educational public charity. We encourage all those who approve of his action against the &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; to send a tax-deductible contribution to:</p>

		<p>Thanks for the address. I will send some little amount to help stop these people. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if enough AR&rsquo;ers chipped in and get this travesty satisfactorily resolved so the next attempt and the next and the next will each have a more and more difficult time in thwarting OUR free speech. Also, I suggest a boycott of &#8220;The Help&#8221;. It might have had some moral points two generations ago but not now.</p>

		<p>Hear, hear! So often you read an hear about frivolous lawsuits, but this is the farthest thing from it. Infringing on a group&rsquo;s freedom of speech and assembly in a nation that supposedly cherishes it and holds it sacred is one of the most serious offenses you can commit. When some of those involved in the conspiracy are public officials, it&rsquo;s even more heinous. I wish Dr. Yeagley the best of success in his courageous effort.</p>

		<p>Without knowing anything beyond what was on AR, I personally surmised that the reason there was no lawsuit filed yet was that AR was looking for some way to use long-arm statutes to shop for a verdict where it would be far easier to get a verdict of liability against the defendants.  In other words, it would be hard to win lawsuits against Imm, Jenkins, (maybe) Cannon, etc. if you sued them where they are physically.  </p>
<p>That this lawsuit is being brought in Oklahoma must mean that the plaintiffs must think that they can connect all the defendants to Oklahoma in some fashion, such that they&rsquo;re &#8220;there,&#8221; to fit the &#8220;you sue a defendant where you can find them&#8221; axiom.</p>
<p>I also think, again without knowing, that Yeagley is acting as the public face of AR, that AR/NCF itself isn&rsquo;t suing and &#8220;outsourcing&#8221; it to Yeagley for some Machiavellian reason.  Someone who is part Indian might have an easier time winning a lawsuit in Oklahoma.</p>

		<p> So good to hear that Dr. Yeagley is taking on these cowardly thugs in the way that always gets people&rsquo;s attention in this country: The courts. A number of AmRen readers, including myself, have urged AmRen and the others involved in arranging these conferences, to sue these leftist fascists whenever something like this happens. Get deeply into their pocketbooks, and they&rsquo;ll back off   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s almost guaranteed. </p>

		<p>David Yeagley is a personal hero of mine and he is a a true American patriot who&rsquo;s brilliance is not recognized by the American nationalist movenment.  I do believe we need to ne more inclusive of people like Mr. Yeagley or Michelle Malkin that are truly American nationalists/patriots.  I think that much of the Native American community compared to the Latino/Latina community, the Asian communities, or the &#8220;African American community.&#8221;   Because of the Native Americans&rsquo; immersion into mainstream white culture, particularly marrying into the Scots Irish conquerors with Cherokees, Comanches, Navajos, Seminoles, and others.  These ones I just named are also typically the most successful American Indian tribes,which is not surpirising.</p>

		<p>Great news. <br>
It is time that the race realists and moderates gave these radical liberal bigots a bloody nose.</p>
<p>In the UK nationalist groups continue to suffer similar assaults on their constitutional rights and freedoms from the bigoted left who brand them them as neo-nazi-facists-racists. One tactic of the left is to prevent public marches on the streets by the moderates / realists. Another is to tie the moderate/realists up in the law courts and so drain their financial resources to prevent them from furthering their cause.</p>
<p>Conversely I hope the damages won from this suite go a long way toward funding the race realist movement and their democratic rights to public assembly.</p>

<p>Dr. Yeagley is a brave man.  By taking on these cowardly thugs in their padded play pen of the kangaroo court of the Americas he risks more than life and limb.  </p>
<p>As a means of educating us and showing posterity how it was done he must chronicle this fight with a diary of the day to day events.  And the documents filed in the courts must be posted so that we can watch the happenings in a way that demonstrates reality.  AmRen must set aside and feature the webspace necessary for this court battle, the only arena left for the White Race to defend its self from genocide in the New World Order.</p>
<p>Most of us are hobbled with our sacred ideas about things of which we have very limited knowledge and almost no experience.<br>
As Dr. Yeagley walks this path and these events unfold we will see just how ignorant we really are.</p>
<p>God be with you Dr. Yeagley.</p>

		<p>Post #14  &mdash;  As for hitting them in the pocketbook  &mdash;  perhaps what is most feared by the ultimate sources for this specific assault upon rights of assembly and speech is &#8220;discovery&#8221;  &mdash;  what a legal case might succeed in unearthing and put into the public record?  As layman in legal matters, I nonetheless ponder whether RICO  &mdash;  at least it provisions for civil actions  &mdash;  affords any practical basis for recourse at the federal court level?    <br>

		<p>This is a little off subject - but - another group that could really use our help is Youth for Western Civilization. They&rsquo;re a nice group of clean cut young Whites that stand up for Whites and Western culture mainly on college campuses and man do they catch hell from the liberals. On their site they show that they&rsquo;ve only raised $4,078 of a $10,000 goal which is pretty sad 9 months into the year. I wonder how long it would take some ghetto thugs to raise $10,000 for some lame-brain ghetto cause, 20 minutes, maybe an hour? And all from White people no doubt! Folks, we need to stop giving our hard earned money to charities that mainly help non-Whites/ non-Americans and instead start giving it to those that help us like - Bad Eagle, Amren, Youths For Western Civilization, CofCC and others.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of this action, which is very much needed. I think you&rsquo;re on sound legal ground here. However, don&rsquo;t be at all surprised if the jury awards you $1, especially if you have nonwhites serving (which will very likely be the case), or even finds for the defendants, given that you do represent a politically-incorrect world view.</p>
<p>True justice may not be possible this side of heaven. That being said, I&rsquo;d hate to go to my grave saying I hadn&rsquo;t at least tried.</p>

<p>It is BAD Eagle, not BALD Eagle.  I think that was the error in the reader&rsquo;s response.  </p>
<p>Now, I would also like to ad that these opponents of AmRen are not &#8220;anti-fascist.&#8221;  That is a lie.  They ARE fascists.  They merely disguise themselves as noble heroes, using a completely false name, &#8220;anti-fascist.&#8221;  They would also call themselves &#8220;activists&#8221; rather than thugs, because they want to cover their tactics with the very finest disguise.  </p>
<p>Unions?  Is it all basically about unions?  Remember, United Steel International&rsquo;s vice-president wrote a piece in TheHill.com all against American Renaissance.  </p>
<p>Again, thank you for your support.  Also, on BadEagle.com, there is a PayPal button that can be used for anyone preferring that method.    </p>

		<p>The Berkeley Free Speech Movement devolved into the dirty speech movement. By the late 1960s Berkeley radicals were shouting down speakers they disagreed with. <br>
 <br>
The freedom that I value more than anything else is intellectual freedom. I want to be able to study any point of view, evaluate any facts, make up my mind, and express my opinions safely. <br>
 <br>
During much of the twentieth century it was dangerous to criticize capitalism, advocate socialism, or defend the Soviet Union. Now it is dangerous to maintain that genetics is important to the human predicament. <br>
 <br>
Those who interfere with American Renaissance conferences deserve more than to be sued; they deserve to be imprisoned. </p>

		<p>I have always felt that having intellectual discussions at fashionable venues was counter-productive to our movement of free thinkers. We need our own march on someplace. My favorite would be Trenton N.J. WE could have hundreds of boats cross the Delaware and meet on the other side and walk the 6 miles to town through some of the wonderful housing developments made to re-enslave blacks.We could meet at City Hall and spend an hour telling the assorted hate groups that will mass around us that those 100 private planes flying over head among the TV helicopters are Amren gun ships. We could bomb the horde with copies of the Bill of Rights and Thomas Paine`s &#8221; The American Crisis.&#8221; We need to fill our canteens witP invisible whiskey and since most of us are in our dotage carry heavy handled walking sticks.Washington had about 1500; we should have about 150,000. Wouldn`t it be glorius to hear once again,&#8221; Disperse ye rebels?&#8221;<br>

<p>This bears repeating. WHY don&rsquo;t Whites give to those you named above? They will give to the Red Cross, Africa Aid, Haiti Aid, World Aid, Church charities, and all the rest (which mainly goes to minorities) but nothing to help their own brethren. One problem is none of these groups are advertised in the mainstream (of course) and not many even know about them. There are plenty of rich and middle class White conservatives but I bet they won&rsquo;t give much of anything to these groups. Especially the White &#8220;racist&#8221; groups since they all love &#8220;diversity&#8221; and fear being called racist. Shame on them all.</p>

		<p>Our failure to donate sufficiently to our own cause is the death of our civilisation and race. We must remeber that the body politic is not longer ours, corporations are no longer ours.  We must be able to sustain serious and repeated legal challenges to place our enemies on the backfoot. Litterally hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to do what must be done, yet with sufficient donations only $1/month per person will do.  I have made a commitment to myself that I will donate at least 1% of after tax income to causes such as Amren.  On top of this I will make special donations, purchase literature and subscriptions (I will not read for free) etc.  If I win the lottery Amren will be taken care off.</p>

<p>Mussolini coined the term &#8220;fascist&#8221;, as being the union of Communism and Ultra-Capitalism. Is Amren soliciting for Communism and Ultra-Capitalism? No? Thought not. What the &#8220;anti-fascists&#8221; are is anti-White.</p>

I cannot help but think it would be a great kindness of us to visit over there (in the raiding party spirit of his ancestors) and leave commentary in great profusion-perhaps even taking over the entire territory.

		<p>On top of the law suit, the thugs that shut down the AR conference should be facing criminal charges and jail time.  Like some posters  have  already asked, where is the FBI?  This case should have been seriously investigated.  To shut down a business contract between two parties with threats of murder and violence constitutes terrorist activity so where is Janet Napalitano and the DHS? Perhaps she is too busy making sleazy deals with the SPLC.<br>
    What about the ACLU? Here is a group that is so dedicated to defending &#8220;freedom of speech&#8221; that they defended a demented messed up church group who ruined many funerals of our fallen soldiers with their foul and obscene diatribe all the time hiding behind the first amendment.<br>
     The people of AR simply tell the truth about race and crime and multiculturalism and the affect it all has on America using nothing but facts and real articles from around the country and the liberals can&rsquo;t stand it because they have nothing to back up anything they say except hate and hysteria and as a result they continually lose out to people that have knowledge and common sense. So in the end the liberal thugs must resort to threats of murder and violence because they have nothing left and they know it.<br>
   I want to say thanks to David Yeagley for getting the ball rolling on this and hopefully these thugs will all be caught. Meanwhile the motel owners need to hang their gutless heads in shame as they should have got the authorities involved in this after the first phone call.  These thugs like to call AR a bunch of Fascists yet they are the ones that are acting like Fascists and are too stupid to even know it.  They have no idea of what the word means because they are ignorant and illiterate. Thus we have the &#8220;liberal mind&#8221; which is based on hysteria, ignorance, hate, and propaganda.      </p>

		<p>What we need to do is take the fight to the strongholds of the left: We must use the internet to get the message out that CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post, and every leftwing news outlet discriminates against blacks. We all know that white liberals really detest blacks, and this will be a good way to force blacks and black culture down the throats of white liberals everywhere. Remember&hellip;. it&rsquo;s easy to stir up blacks, and we should stir them up against the white liberals who are keeping them (and us) down. We have Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo and Google chatrooms and message boards&hellip;.. let&rsquo;s get busy! <br>
     I&rsquo;m sure that this effort will put the white liberals in a bind, and force them to really decide on which direction they really want to go in: Whether they want to &#8220;move forward&#8221; with their movement, or whether they want to &#8220;go backwards&#8221; to that cherished time where civility prevailed.

<p>I was alarmed on the One People&rsquo;s Project site   &mdash;   not only are they deeming the NPI conference in Washington as a &#8220;White Supremacist Gathering&#8221;, but also the exceedingly benign HL Mencken Club conference in Baltimore as White Supremacist as well.  For the latter, OPP defines its paleoconservative attendees as &#8220;suit-and-tie Nazis&#8221;.</p>
<p>OPP readers are not the sharpest knives in the drawer.  OPP&rsquo;s hatemongering, declaring every conference in which somebody might say something politically incorrect as loaded with Nazis is going to eventually result in ignorant but excitable OPP readers engaging in violence against conference attendees.  <br>
Hopefully Dr. Yeagley and his lawyers will be successful in halting the OPP director from his efforts in this regard.<br>

		<p>This is indeed encouraging.  As an Indian, who professes to believe in the positive elements of American history, I feel I must pursue this case.  I have always professed that the American Indian role in modern America could be found by recovering the <em>original</em> role  &mdash;  the host, the guide, the &#8220;savior&#8221; to the newly arrived white man.  This is the mythic role played by the Indians when the Pilgrims first arrived.  Remember?  Only in this kind of role can the now tiny minority Indian find a meaningful place in modern America.  The Indian must again to the right thing. Right is his only power, now.  He has no other hope. I do this thing, I confront these anti-American fascists, not only for the White man, but <em>for the Indian.</em>  </p>
<p>I consider it a very great honor, a supreme honor with quintessential meaning, to do this thing.  In honoring the White Man, I also honor the Indian.  </p>
<p>This is the intent, anyway.  It is the ideal.  It is the hope.  I appreciate your support, your prayers, and your strength of heart.  I will try to do this thing, one way or another.  It is for all Americans, I suppose even for the fascist&rsquo;s right to say what he has to say.  I personally consider it insurrection, and treason, but, they have the freedom to claim it isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I only hope the Oklahoma court responds in a truly American way.   </p>

		<p>By the say, among my personal opponents are Al Carroll and Brent M. Davids, both of whom I&rsquo;m suing in a private &#8220;libel/slander&#8221; suit.  Among their many offenses is the fact that Carroll created &#8220;DavidYeagley.org,&#8221; and Brent Davids created &#8220;BadEagle.org.&#8221;  The internet, of course, was the perfect opportunity for them, and the cadre they creating around them.  Amazon.com and Google, of course, cooperated fully with them.  I own the trademark to both names.  </p>
<p>I would also add that they were foremost in spreading the libel that I am not the son of my own mother, and that I was adopted.  This choice piece of libel was created one month after my mother died (April 9, 2005).  It has grown into the illusion of internet &#8220;fact,&#8221; when it is utterly false.  It was designed to discredit me, obviously.  I have every historical record possible to demonstrate that I am a Comanche Indian, son of my Comanche mother, etc., all the way to Bad Eagle (quin-ne kish-su-it).  It is not a factual issue.  </p>
<p>This is a separate issue, certainly, and if any such accusation comes up in this suit against the Communists, I shall be happy to add them to my libel suit.  No problem.  </p>
<p>The Left doesn&rsquo;t want a warrior Indian to be an American patriot.  They want a professional, crying protester, an anti-American, and a violent street thug.  Remember AIM?  And so I live with these false accusations, temporarily.    </p>

<p>At The Atlantic, UCLA law professor Adam Winkler previews his forthcoming book Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America. Winkler&rsquo;s whole essay is worth reading, but I thought I&rsquo;d highlight his fascinating discussion of how the Black Panthers &ldquo;launched the modern gun-rights movement&rdquo; on May 2, 1967:</p>
<p>OPPOSITION TO GUN CONTROL was what drove the black militants to visit the California capitol with loaded weapons in hand. The Black Panther Party had been formed six months earlier, in Oakland, by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale. Like many young African Americans, Newton and Seale were frustrated with the failed promise of the civil-rights movement. Brown v. Board of Education, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were legal landmarks, but they had yet to deliver equal opportunity. In Newton and Seale&rsquo;s view, the only tangible outcome of the civil-rights movement had been more violence and oppression, much of it committed by the very entity meant to protect and serve the public: the police.</p>
<p>Inspired by the teachings of Malcolm X, Newton and Seale decided to fight back. Before he was assassinated in 1965, Malcolm X had preached against Martin Luther King Jr.&rsquo;s brand of nonviolent resistance. Because the government was &ldquo;either unable or unwilling to protect the lives and property&rdquo; of blacks, he said, they had to defend themselves &ldquo;by whatever means necessary.&rdquo; Malcolm X illustrated the idea for Ebony magazine by posing for photographs in suit and tie, peering out a window with an M-1 carbine semiautomatic in hand. Malcolm X and the Panthers described their right to use guns in self-defense in constitutional terms. &ldquo;Article number two of the constitutional amendments,&rdquo; Malcolm X argued, &ldquo;provides you and me the right to own a rifle or a shotgun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guns became central to the Panthers&rsquo; identity, as they taught their early recruits that &ldquo;the gun is the only thing that will free us &mdash; gain us our liberation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things do often look rather bleak in these latter days. But, I am greatly comforted that a Comanche Indian chief is on our side. Mexico may have made some territorial claims to the South Western, Pacific Northwest for a few years after Spain decided to break formal union with Aztecs and Spanish playboys in the New World - but I do note that the Comanches were the most efficient border patrols in American history.</p>

		<p>AIM, Black Panther Party, SLA, Jewish Defense League, Nation of Islam, and CAIR are in the same organizational boat of &#8220;American terrorist organizations.&#8221;  I am very pro-Jewish, but not Zionist.  Modern Jews confuse the two that you cannot be the same thing.  I am a member of the Cherokee Nation, which is a proud American Indian nation that was one of the most assimilated, but many still believe u have to be leftist and Indian.  Thankfully, that perception is  changing in certain tribes in the American Indian world.  Although I am only 16% Eastern Cherokee, Dutch, Scots Irish, and English, I feel that American Indians, particularly such as the Comanches, Cherokees, Shawnees, Navajoes, and Creeks would be excellent allies with regular Native white Americans, as David Yeagley has proven.  Yeagley is a top thinker in the United States and the American Indian, to not be forgotten, like his relative who fought the Spanish, French and Mexicans, Quanah Parker was as Theodore Roosevelt said, &#8220;He was the last Indian, and the first American.&#8221;  We need allies, and among these formidable pro American allies, we can also become more organized, starting charities, law firms, organizations, and transnational alliances with Swiss national political parties, recruit immigrants from Scandanavia, Northern Europe, and Britain and Ulster.  We need manpower in this struggle.  </p>

		<p>Legal recourse is along a battleline, of course, as concerns the overall denial to AR and its supporters of right of speech and assembly.   Would a point of useful struggle be utilizing the federal Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act?  The PA permits invidiuals to submit information relevant to any files or presumed files involving them.  Believe me, the &#8220;witchfinding&#8221; biz gets heavily into omitting key facts, and in putting fake borders into a field of<br>
relevant facts so that some of them are arbitrarily omitted, and so on.  A very real threat to this shyster misrepresentation is providing full facts.  Lawyers easily get into these games of &#8220;factual enhancement/adornment&#8221;.  Police don&rsquo;t like them. Corrective information in fed files tends to walk around.  As to FOIA (almost all states have a counterpart law ), personal file access routinely takes a few years, but there are exceptions for expediting access.  If individuals with significant involvement as a potential AR attendee or presenter seek file information, it is vital always in a written request to specify that you<br>
will NOT pay costs above (a clearly specified amount) unless you have been notified about such costs above ( amount) BEFORE they are incurred and have assented in writing to paying them BEFORE they are incurred.  Contents of file information obtained under FOIA have sometimes  turned out to have bombshell impact against the &#8220;witchfinders&#8221; who contrive these attacks against freedom of speech and assembly.  The wolves like trouble-free feeding.  </p>

		<p>Istvan 44- White Canadians, British and Australians have a lot of shared history, heritage and blood above all else. Many Canadians are proud of their heritage in these islands as well as in the great country they built in North America, it&rsquo;s really only politics and distance that separates us. </p>
<p>Sure, there were troubles and tensions, even fraternal war for which we must accept some blame (most notably the events of 1776, and the Irish were never especially keen on us post-Protestantism), but the British, Canadians and Australians and New Zealanders, not to mention many Americans of British heritage are brothers- while these islands were the starting point, those born here claim no privilege among their fellows (that being King George&rsquo;s great mistake in the 18th Century)</p>

		<p>I would like to thank and commend Dr. David Yeagley for his willingness to fight back and take the enemies of Western Civilization to court.  I wish him success in this endeavor and will donate to his cause as my means allow.   </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud that this Comanche Indian is on our side.  </p>

		<p>I met Dr. Yeagley at the last mini-AmRen conference. After the dinner Jared Taylor took us out to, he sat with me in the car that we were driving back to the hotel in. He is a very interesting, accomplished and ballsy guy. I still have the photocopy of the picture that he drew when he was in primary school. It is a picture of an Indian village burning with the words &#8220;stop fires&#8221; on it. </p>
<p>Everybody should support him in his efforts to bring these thugs to justice.</p>

<p>And what about those of British descent in South Africa and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe?</p>
<p>Why did you exclude them (and the wars the British prosecuted against both black and white in these territories) from your dominion list?</p>

		<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m on your side folks! However, I have not read all of the facts. At first blush, it would appear to be appropriate to go against the hotels whom had shut you down, IF YOU FOLKS HAD A PRE-EXISTING CONTRACT WITH THE HOTEL. As to these defendants, it may only be a defamation action, which is usually only about 6 months time to bring the lawsuit. I cannot understand why some people calling the hotels to stop hosting events by you folks renders the telephone callers liable.  It seems to me the HOTELS should be held liable!! Again, I would need to perform legal research on this, though. If you folks had an agreement with the HOTELS, and the HOTELS caved in to the telephone callers, for whatever reason, such as fear of loss of future business, then it would seem to me the HOTELS should be the ones to be liable here.  The HOTELS have the deep pockets, anyway.  IF you folks had an agreement with the HOTELS prior to the telephone callers demanding a stop to the event.</p>

		<p>Zuckerman, <br>
I appreciate your view.  Of course, the hotels&rsquo; breech of contract is a different matter, or, a different suit.  We are suing those who continually attacked AmRen, and who are responsible for making threats.   </p>

Can&rsquo;t say about Virginia;  but in New York State making threats by telephone would be Aggravated Harassment, at the least.</p>

Excellent question  &mdash;  where&rsquo; the FBI, etc.  It should not be<br>
lost upon the intelligence agencies within other governments<br>
potentially hostile to us (China, Brazil, Russia, etc ). <br>
It is a real &#8220;Black Box&#8221; challenge to model an explanation of how<br>
$PLC /or similar outfits / can intimidate agencies designed to<br>
protect our constitutional rights.  </p>

		<p>Clicking on the word &#8220;cancelled&#8221; gets us to Jared Taylor&rsquo;s April 2010 article &#8220;Reflections on the 2010 AR Conference.  Scrolling down that article I saw a picture of Jared being interviewed on Russian TV but clicking on that picture got me nowhere, so I Googled for the interview and found it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://goo.gl/IXMhm" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/IXMhm</a></p>
<p>Interesting interview and Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s comments were reasonable.  Thank you, Jared, for having the guts to say what we all know is true.</p>

Interesting reference here to Russian media.  In the context of<br>
post #61, Secretary of State  Clinton, among others, ought to have some concern about the antics of the witch-finders who are on such<br>
a rampage.        </p>
