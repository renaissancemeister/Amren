<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15013383">France Imposes First Niqab Fines</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC, September 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two French Muslim women who continue to wear the full-face veil in defiance of a new law banning it in France have been issued fines by a court.</p>
<p>Hind Ahmas and Najate Nait Ali were arrested wearing the niqab in public outside Meaux town hall, eastern Paris, soon after the law came in in May.</p>
<p>The women say they will appeal against their punishment all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile another woman said she would stand for president in her niqab.</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s sentencing in Meaux was closely followed not just in France but right across Europe, says the BBC&rsquo;s Christian Fraser in Paris.</p>
<p>Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland all have  &mdash;  or are planning  &mdash;  similar legislation.</p>
<p>Assault claims</p>
<p>Divorced mother Hind Ahmas, 32, a mother-of-three, was fined 120 euros (Â£104) by the court.</p>
<p>Before the hearing she said she was hoping a fine would be imposed, to enable her to challenge it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without a condemnation I can&rsquo;t move forward. There has to be this sanction with a fine so that I can take this to the European Court of Human Rights. It&rsquo;s imperative that there&rsquo;s a sanction,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Najate Nait Ali was fined 80 euros.</p>
<p>They become the first of 91 women stopped by French police to be handed a fine.</p>
<p>Ahmas&rsquo;s parents were not strict Muslims. She told the BBC she put on the niqab for the first time six years ago as an educated single woman.</p>
<p>She claims she once wore mini-skirts and liked to party before she rediscovered her faith.</p>
<p>Some Muslim groups say since the ban was introduced in April a number of women have been assaulted both verbally and physically by members of the public.</p>
<p>These two women would most likely have to exhaust the appeals process in France  &mdash;  which can take considerable time  &mdash;  before they can hope to test the legislation in the European court in Strasbourg, our correspondent says.</p>
<p>Another high-profile niqab-wearer, Kenza Drider, has said she will stand for president in the 2012 election.</p>
<p>She has become a champion for several hundred women in France who insist wearing the niqab is a personal choice and a right enshrined by European law.</p>
<p>She said: &#8220;The reality is, there is a lot of unemployment in France and a lot of problems in France so let&rsquo;s not focus on what I wear, let&rsquo;s deal with the real problems. So my candidacy is really being done for that. To say don&rsquo;t stop at what I&rsquo;m wearing, but go much deeper.&#8221;</p>

<p>YOU are a REAL problem (yes there are other problems as well). Demographics change destiny.</p>
<p>France is not a Islamic nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muslims charged want to appeal &#8216;all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>I say leave the EU.</p>

		<p>There is a book called, &#8220;While Europe Slept.&#8221; I recommend it.</p>
<p>The author states that in districts that Muslims control, in Europe, native European women are FORCED to wear a veil, under threat of being raped. </p>
<p>These Muslims, in these neighborhoods, have no scruples against forcing other people to accept their customs.</p>
<p>I am glad that France is showing some muscle, but soon the muscle-level is going to have to be upped. It has to begin somewhere.   </p>

		<p>I view this &#8220;Niqab&#8221; flap as a symptom. France had to be socially psychotic to allow significant numbers of Muslims to immigrate. There was no rational reason to admit them; there were many reasons to exclude them: environmental, economic, social. Now that the Muslims are embedded in France, they are engaging in colonizing, propagating, and spreading their faith. All this was predicted by those wiser than post 1960&rsquo;s French leaders.</p>

		<p>Left unasked is the question of why there is a &#8220;European Court of Human Rights&#8221; in the first place.  Since when does some unelected Supreme Soviet get to dictate to a sovereign nation what its laws may or may not decree?</p>
<p>Hey, Frenchmen  &mdash;  how do you like your &#8220;European Union&#8221; now?  Are you ready to assert yourselves yet?<br>

		<p>There is a definite safety issue for people to go around with their faces covered. It should be obvious- there is no way to tell whether there is a man, woman or bank robber behind the mask and I would definitely be nervous if someone came into my place of business with their face covered. Where I live on Halloween most of the businesses post a sign requesting customers no wear masks in the store. Face covering is not even required in Islam to begin with. This is really a safety issue, not a human rights issue. </p>

		<p>That reminds me of a case in Switzerland. An Islamic family took their daughter out of swimming in elementary school because her faith didn&rsquo;t allow boys and girls to swim together. The Swiss fined her 1400.swiss francs. She took it all the way to the top court saying that &#8220;it went against her human rights.&#8221; Well the court sided with the Swiss and they family had to pay the fine. The Swiss said that &#8220;they don&rsquo;t want to start creating parallel societies. Until middle school all the kids go swimming together.&#8221; Switzerland is a small country but they have backbone and vision. It gave other European countries courage when they voted for a ban on minarets too.</p>

<p>SKIP the psychic predicts&hellip;&hellip;this woman will prevail in the courts AND she will be elected to some very influential office where she is from. From there, the muslims will continue to usurp their threat of violence and votes to get everything they damand, which, of course, will be the total submission to islam of the French citizens which will be facilitated by the French politicians as is being done here in America. It is to late to deport them or take any legal action against them, violence is the only way to deal with them now and it would appear that the Serbs are the only ones on the FN planet prepared to do that.</p>

		<p>A small victory folks, but LOOK at the stories today!<br>
Almost all of them are about mainstream marxist media reporting bad, bad turns for mass immigration&hellip;things they would not have done even a year ago.<br>
This little victory is just the first swell of a massive wave that&rsquo;s about to crash on all those muslim butts praying illegally in French streets. An enema for the ages!</p>
<p>Folks, the tide has already turned. I&rsquo;ll not say it&rsquo;s going to be easy or pretty, but rather liken it to Churchill&rsquo;s amazing speech about WWI. (Forgive my hasty paraphrase);<br>
It is not the end. Nor is it the beginning of the end. But is perhaps the end of the beginning.&#8221;<br>
Friends, it is at least the end of the beginning. The Muslim culture killers and the mestizo horde here in America, the black flash mobbers, and the Marxist enablers, are in for one hell of a backlash. They brought it. They will reap it.</p>

still i like to point out that masks and beards are not required by islam.</p>

		<p>More French marxist stupidity. The niqab is not the problem, muslims are. The muslims will not all turn French if they don&rsquo;t wear a niqab. They neither are able to nor want to assimilate. The only hope for France, and all of Europe for that matter, is to deport all muslims.</p>

<p>- Even this is not good enough. What if millions more Muslims immigrate to the West but follow the host countries laws? If we are replaced, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if our replacements followed the law or not, as we still end up at the point of extinction.  Such immigration should never have been allowed in the first place.  Now, the end result will most likely be increased violence to the point of genocide. And as the demographic tide changes in favor of the Muslim, and combining that with their will to destroy the West, it will be our genocide, not theirs.</p>

<p>If only by sheer numbers, the bad will drive out the good.   The Trojan horse is already with our gates.  No matter all our universities, our massive  array of weapons, and our technological expertise,  none of that will matter.  They will  take control and dominate simply by out-breeding us.   They may be primitive, but they seem to know this by instinct. They are instinctively following the inevitable path to conquest,  taking advantage of our timidity, guilt,  disorganization,  and our low birth rates,  while we do nothing.  Another twenty years will tell. </p>
<p>This  creeping  conquest inches forward year by year,  and WE are supinely ALLOWING it!   Modern Westerners (whites), addicted to their wealth, comforts, and gadgets,  refuse to take the necessary steps for their  own survival. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, our useless politicians, pretending to take some kind of action, pass laws against veils! &hellip;. when they ought to be  passing laws for massive deportations. </p>
