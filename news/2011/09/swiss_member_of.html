		<p>Like many AmRen readers, I&rsquo;ve been watching the Swiss People&rsquo;s Party for some time now. At least since that oh-so-subtle poster of the white sheep kicking the black sheep out of the country. I have to say, I&rsquo;m a little envious of Switzerland for not only having a nationalist party, but also for actually voting for that party.</p>

		<p>He does really well and I was thrilled, until his last sentence.  &#8220;Love they neighbor&#8221; means Muslims by default.  It is this Christian contradiction that will be the most difficult obstacle in recapturing the real European spirit and will to throw off and throw out the people who are set to murder Europe.</p>

		<p>I quite dislike the whole &#8220;Wake up&#8221; sentiment as most people are fully aware of what is going on. The problem is with the politicians and the governments and not the commoners.  Multiculturalism has reached the point of diminished returns and we are now in a period where those disparate cultures are battling for control of resources; monetary, political and otherwise and a tipping point seems inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8216;Gun politics in Switzerland are unique in Europe. The personal weapon of militia is kept at home as part of the military obligations. Switzerland has one of the highest militia gun ownership rates in the world.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Not explicitly racial yet. There are still hints of idealism that eventually should be purged altogether, when he said, e.g. that we are not fighting against &#8220;a people&#8221;. Well, yes we are. But I don&rsquo;t want to nit-pick. This speech really is heartening and I wish I could hear it from an American. That&rsquo;s the irony, that Europe went so much overboard with their xenophilia, more than us, yet now seem to be much more forceful in their rejection of it, at least at the political level. And here we might get Rick Perry as our most conservative candidate, who thinks Texas and Mexico is just one big, happy neighborhood. Great.</p>

		<p>You can talk all you want about political solutions, but the fact is that the Earth has too many people and it is only getting worse. Furthermore, the additional people each year are from the worst ethnic groups. Add to that the rapidly depleting oil source and you have a situation that is bigger than us all. Stay close to your families and friends, learn to grow food, get ammo.</p>

		<p>He is argueing against the Philosophy that says that Ethnic Nations do not exist and that He is no more Swiss than the Family that just got off the Plane from Pakistan, or anywhere else. He is trying to articulate the fact that a Muslim buidup of Population is hostile to the interests of His People. I try to do the same thing, but all I get is &#8220;We&rsquo;re all Human&#8221; and &#8220;Religions are all the Same&#8221;, etc.</p>

		<p>Number #10: &#8220;Love Thy Neighbor&#8221; is not an open invitation for that person to murder you. The Crusades should have proven that. </p>
<p>If these people want to impose their barbarity on the rest of us, and they do, they should know that they are in for a fight. </p>
<p>By the way, please do a Search, or go to You Tube, and watch the video, &#8220;The Third Crusade&#8221;. I had it sent to me several days ago, and it really shows what our enemies are all about, and what they are planning. </p>

		<p>Wow, just listen to that applause!  <br>
This is an EXCELLENT speech, and he is an EXCELLENT speaker   &mdash;    very appealing, very forceful, very impressive.</p>
<p>We need someone like that. No hoods and sheets, no tattoos, just common sense, good personality,  and an appeal to reason.</p>
<p>But I wonder what legal position he finds himself in,  in Germany?  I mean regarding the police.   I hope he&rsquo;s not facing prosecution  for &#8220;defaming a religion&#8221;, &#8220;inciting racism&#8221;, or something such. One has to be very careful  what one says there. Berlin is not in Switzerland!</p>

		<p>Wow - what a great speech!</p>
<p>I have always found Swiss people to be the most practical, intelligent White people in the world - their country is the cleanest, safest, most stable, prosperous country in the world. I did feel that most Swiss lack passion - as they think this leads to conflict and disorder.</p>
<p>But this Swiss speaker has great passion. And when dealing with the invasion of tens of millions of NW Muslim immigrants - we need some passion.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s try to get some of our Romanian/Serb kinsmen to go study/work in Switzerland - try for some marriages between these communities.  I think our kinsmen - Romanian folk hero Count Dracula - Vlad the Impaler could give the Swiss some tips about the best way to handle Muslim invaders.</p>

		<p>The problem is that most white people still do not believe they are a special, unique racial group that must remain separate and distinct from other racial groups. They may appreciate European history and achievement, but they still feel deep down that other racial groups can be assimilated. Not sure this gentleman appreciates this either, but damn that was a good speech. And we need to take whatever we can get.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can a German tell that this is a Swiss speaking from his accent?&#8221;</p>
<p>This speech of Oskar Freisinger was hold in Berlin, so I think his aim was to speak a clear German - with success.  </p>
<p>But by hearing interviews with him made in Switzerland, a German person will know at once that this is his mother tongue. </p>
<p>It sounds just more natural. </p>
