<h1>S.Africa Loses 395,000 Jobs in 2010</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Yahoo! News, September 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South Africa lost 395,000 jobs in 2010, the government said Wednesday, despite the expected windfall from hosting the football World Cup and the nation&rsquo;s recovery from recession.</p>
<p>The poor showing last year followed the loss of 870,000 jobs in 2009, according to Statistics SA, meaning most of the job gains of the last six years have been wiped out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among the South Africans who have jobs, 70 percent are black, against 15 percent for whites. But blacks make up 78 percent of the national population, against 10 percent for whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The country has struggled to add jobs despite rebounding in 2009 from its first recession since the end of apartheid in 1994.</p>
<p>Unemployment currently stands at 25.7 percent, but that counts only those actively seeking work, does not capture the full extent of the jobless problem.</p>

		<p>78% of the population is black, and they hold 70% of all jobs.  That doesn&rsquo;t sound like some wildly unjustified number.  So whites are 10% and hold 15% of the jobs?  Again it is not too out of whack.</p>
<p>This also means that 15% of the jobs are held by Asians and assorted biracial people, who I think are less than 15% of the population.  So S.A. should take jobs away from Asians and give them to blacks!  </p>

		<p>South Africa lost 400000 jobs, but a far more  ignificant fact is that they GAINED far more blacks than that.  All of those blacks will in 15 or more years be screaming for jobs that only Whitey can give.  And Whitey is slowly disappearing from South Africa.  What a future that place has.</p>

		<p>I would be glad to bring a white SA family over here and help them get sorted out.  Even if they were threatened with deportation I would help them - and I&rsquo;d torment local politicians into helping them too.  They would be far more of an asset to this country than the usual immigrants we get.  </p>

		<p>What is not generally known about South Africa is that it has an &#8216;open-door&rsquo; immigration policy with the rest of Africa.<br>
 White leftists aren&rsquo;t the only people in the world to implement such policies in the face of mass unemployment, black lefties do it too!<br>
   Things came to a head a few years ago when black South Aficans lynched and murdered black immigrants from Zimbabwe etc who were taking the jobs of natives.<br>

		<p>Gosh, what a surprise!  Rhodesia and SA have become total economic basket cases since the imposition of black rule.  Could there be a pattern here?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see, Newark, Watts, Gary, Cleveland, Detroit, Philadelphia and countless other American cities have been turned into pools of crime, unemployment, hopelessness, and violence with the ceding of political control to blacks.</p>
<p>This calls for a federally funded study to identify the root causes.</p>

		<p>In view of the fact that South Africa now only has less than 4-million fulltime jobs (i.e. fulltime taxpayers) left; and more than 14-million black people who get charity cheques each month, with some 45-million black residents, the logistics alone can tell one that this country is in deep, deep trouble. More than 800,000 of its 3million-strong Afrikaner (&#8216;white&#8221;)  minority also are living in desperate circumstances, without any rights to access the job-market and getting NO government benefits, not even food-aid. And this was the segment of the population which used to keep the country running so efficiently before the ANC-regime got it handed on a silver platter by F W de Klerk and started firing them all. If there&rsquo;s ever a case-study done on how to destroy a first-world country within just a few decades without ANY kind of &#8216;civil war&rsquo; or &#8216;conflicts&rsquo; or &#8216;wars&rsquo;,  this is the perfect example. </p>

		<p>Clearly the solution to all their problems is the mass immigration of unskilled labour.</p>
<p>After all, this is what the governments of the West have been prescribing for their people for the past half century.</p>
<p>In fact, I think we should be actively donating some of own third world immigrants to boost South Africa&rsquo;s economy. Hell, I&rsquo;m feeling charitable - send them all.</p>

		<p>Bear in mind that the figures quoted here are the formal economy which generates a paper trail to enable some statistics to be kept.</p>
<p>What about the &#8220;grey economy&#8221; and the &#8220;informal sector&#8221;?</p>
<p>The &#8220;informal sector&#8221; would be the hawkers and street traders selling mainly fruit and vegetables, plus coat hangers, plastic bin liners etc at traffic lights</p>
<p>The &#8220;grey economy&#8221; would be the drug dealers, pimps, brothel owners etc.</p>
<p>Neither of these sectors are documented in any way nor do they pay any taxes.</p>
<p>It is guesstimated that South africa has a black illegal immigrant population of between 6 and 10 million. They poured across the borders from the rest of Africa when black majority rule arrived in 1994 and everyone was now &#8220;free&#8221;.</p>
<p>Come and get your slice of the pie said the ANC<br>
What the ANC did not tell them is that their covert policies are systematically destroying job creation. </p>
<p>Since 1994 about 1 million whites (of 5million) have left the country to find a safe place in which to raise their children as well as find work having been excluded from the job market through AA and BEE legislation. The majority of these whites are skilled professionals and the entrepreneurs who created the jobs.</p>
<p>It is estimated that for every professional white collar worker that emigrates about 6 blue collar jobs are lost.</p>
<p>At the same time you have the covert terror campaign forcing the farmers off the land thus creating more unemployment and turning the country into a net importer of food. Once upon a time it exported food into the rest of Africa.</p>
<p>And now you have this idiot Julias Malema banging the nationalisation of the mines  drum.</p>
<p>Go figure. <br>
You do not have to be a genius to see where this is all heading. </p>

hopefully, most readers know you are being sarcastic&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
you probably well know that there are people (leftist) that would think your post is a good idea&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..  <br>
importing blacks is one of the stupidest ideas I&rsquo;ve ever heard of&hellip;&hellip;..  now exporting them, I would like to invest in that.</p>

<p> For decades before 1994 (when the country was turned over to the racist, Marxist ANC), South Africa was the ONLY First World country on the continent.  In less than 15 years, most of the nation has descended into a Third World (not &#8220;developing&#8221;) country with rampant violence against its most productive citizens, a breakdown of its infrastructure, lowering of its standard of living and its quality of life (for all citizens, black, white and other), and, thanks to blatant favoritism (Affirmative Action) in job and school placement, a loss of prestige and reputation in both education and the workforce. In other words, the country is quickly approaching the ungovernable, totally dysfunctional state of every other African &#8220;republic.&#8221;</p>
