<h1>Harvard Research Project Needs Young White Nationalists</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>I am a sociology student at Harvard University conducting research for my senior thesis on young people who are active in the American white nationalist movement. I am most interested in understanding what motivates young people to participate in these movements, as well as how their participation influences their process of growing up.</p>
<p>Because I want to give young people involved in the movement the chance to tell their own stories and to put their perspectives out there, I am conducting interviews with young people ages 18-30 who identify as white nationalists. I wanted to reach out to you and see if any members of the Council of Conservative Citizens who fit my criteria would be willing to speak with me. All answers (as well as the name of the group) would be anonymized in my thesis, and the interview would take 45 minutes to an hour. I am located in Boston, MA, but would be more than happy to set something up via phone or Skype.</p>
<p>I am attaching an information sheet about my project, which further describes the ways I will protect participants and their data. If you have any other questions, I am more than happy to speak with you at any time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention. </p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Keri Hartman<br>

		<p>&#8220;I am most interested in understanding what motivates young people to participate in these movements, as well as how their participation influences their process of growing up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have thought someone setting up to write a thesis would have more conscientiously prepared their research goals and the presentation language used in the way she makes her initial contacts of the groups she wishes to study.  That might make her project seem a little more scholastic and less a high-school social studies report.  The way this sentence is structured implies that those she means to interview, white nationalists between 18-30 haven&rsquo;t grown up yet.  Her first sentence seems to imply that she is setting up to perform a hatchet job on the youngest and most intellectually undeveloped of &#8220;white nationalists.&#8221;  She seems to telegraph such intention.  It also seems to point out to me that she doesn&rsquo;t really understand her subject very well.  I wonder if she has ever read the term &#8220;race realism?&#8221;  Many regular posters are not nationalists in the usual sense of it, but race separatists.</p>
<p>I would suggest anyone thinking of contacting her for an interview look into her background and affiliations.  It may be best to not cooperate with someone like her, who may be simply looking for some fodder for use against any notion of a pro-white movement or identity.</p>

		<p>Given that Keri Hartman works at Harvard University we can be sure that she wants to interview &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; in order to smear and demonize them.  Even if I were in the right age bracket, and even if I liked the term &#8220;white nationalist&#8221; (I don&rsquo;t much care for it) I wouldn&rsquo;t volunteer.<br>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t trust any white person doing research from Harvard on this subject matter. Even if this graduate student is on the level, the research department and adviser would likely insist on  presenting our motives as illegitimate, paranoid, far- right and everything else. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a lose,- lose for the participants. And the final thesis will paint them as fools.</p>

		<p>Interesting&hellip; theoretically this could be a potentially positive thing. As a 23 year old White Nationalist, it seems like an attractive offer; to show that not all White Nationalist/Race Realists are belligerent Neo-Nazis. Undeniably there are those that are, but I feel most WN (whether they self identify as it or not) are reasonable people. And seeing as how she is directly addressing CofCC, I suspect that you would get an abundance of intelligent WNs. Of course being a WN&hellip; I would be hopelessly naive if I wasn&rsquo;t suspicious of this offer. This could either be a friendly and genuine &#8220;lets get to know and understand WN, and see what their concerns are&#8221;   &mdash;  - or it could be &#8220;how can we fix and stop these &#8216;dangerous&rsquo; &#8216;racist&rsquo; believes from spreading!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I would suspect that the latter would be more desirable for her academic pursuit - just imagine how that would look if she showed any sympathy without immediate condemnation! However she is a Sociology Major and could also be a nice a-political and unbiased look at the subject. </p>
<p>I am curious about perhaps participating in this - if anything to show that we aren&rsquo;t all irrational reactionary demons. Any thoughts about this? Good idea/bad idea? </p>

		<p>Keri is a typical product of modern higher learning, a feminist: &#8220;I love Athena because we are a community of high school and college women who are united to CHANGE THE WORLD.</p>
<p>I can be a resource for owning up to privilege and using it productively, 1990s pop-punk, speaking up in class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps reading up on her hero Maya Angelou, or familiarizing yourself with the &#8216;The Vagina Monologues&rsquo; will give you common ground, eh?!  Otherwise I suspect it&rsquo;d be like talking to a bag of hammers.</p>

First off, who is this Keri Hartman? She needs to be checked out thoroughly. Why the interest all of a sudden? WE have been demonized for decades and now this?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t trust these people, no matter who they say they are. We know how words can be twisted and edited by those who really do not like WN&rsquo;s. They like to exploit them and then show the world how &#8220;evil&#8221; these White racialists are. WE know how the FBI, ADL/SPLC and our own government will use that information, don&rsquo;t we?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m making assumptions here based on her attending Harvard (liberal enclave these days) and her being a feminist, and the belief that universities and colleges no longer do pure research, but rather start with a pre-conceived notion (agenda) and then &#8220;research&#8221; i.e. cherry pick or slant to affirm their pre-conceived notion.  This is a hatchet job in the making.  Anybody who participates can expect to see their name, or enough information about them to identify them without a name, smeared, demonized and slandered.  There will be NO objectivity in this piece.  She is hoping for some wild eyed, shaven headed, red suspender wearing folks, or for some kluxers, to respond.<br>
All race realists, white nationalists, white separatists will be tarred with THAT brush. Guaranteed.  Else, why the need for a personal meet, or a Skype interview?  She will pick the most frightening and weird, that&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be naive and assume she will show you, as a WN, in a positive light.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her, especially after reading the profiles Anon #3 provided.   Athena&rsquo;s mission statement reads:  &#8220;the Athena Program provides a validating and supportive space to combat structural and internalized oppression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Guess WHO she believes is the &#8220;internal and structural oppressor?&#8221;  You, as a WN would only be fodder for her hateful, lefty screed.  Steer clear.</p>

I&rsquo;m split on this one.</p>
<p>I agree with GWN. I don&rsquo;t trust this person to be objective in any way. I believe she has an agenda. When I read, &#8220;I am most interested in understanding what motivates young people to participate in these movements, as well as how their participation influences their process of growing up&#8221;, what I&rsquo;m hearing is, &#8216;I want to know why these young men are racists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I agree with Fimbulvet that this is an opportunity to get intelligent young men to speak for the cause. It would be better to interview CofCC and AR members than to find angry, confused, and violent young me.  </p>
<p>Is it a set-up or an honest inquiry? I don&rsquo;t know. However, from past experience, I don&rsquo;t want to aid any liberal in their agenda.</p>

		<p>I get the impression that she&rsquo;s anything but objective and has a liberal mindset that can&rsquo;t be changed by any amount of objective information.  Massachusetts, especially the Boston area, isn&rsquo;t known for tolerating any thoughts other than those that have to do with airhead liberalism, so anything she writes is going to be framed as a kind of exposé.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure she&rsquo;s taking off on this project with the same attitude she would if she were interviewing murderers to find out why they did what they did, and I&rsquo;m equally certain she feels that murderers are a cut above white nationalists.</p>
<p>Somebody she interviews should tell her that if she waits a while longer, when the rabble are beating at her door, she&rsquo;ll be able to see up close and personal why people choose white nationalism. Right now she&rsquo;s so smug with her obvious feelings of moral superiority she&rsquo;s blind to the truth.</p>
<p>I really think she would be more comfortable with a thesis that answers the question about why whites are so evil and cruel. </p>

		<p>Look, people in academics have to write. In grad school, they have to publish. </p>
<p>I would not trust this young woman in the least, given her profile, but she is mainly full of it, as are most social scientists, or wannabe - social scientists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just junk to fill a page, to manufacture a career, to gain undeserved nototiety, to cash in. Just like being some nutjob pseudo- actor on a reality tv show, or a sleazy salesperson, or a politician. Just acting, to get ahead.</p>
<p>ANON#3: GREAT job on showing us a bit of who this little marxist is. </p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll probably either get some deluded unfortunates to fill her little &#8220;study,&#8221; or give up on it and write a thesis on white male repression of the gynoverse.</p>

		<p>This one is about as transparent as they come. This young woman&rsquo;s background, affiliations and interests plainly telegraph her true intentions.

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the description of the Athena Program at Harvard which she is involved with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Through mentoring relationships, workshops, and conferences, the Athena Program provides a validating and supportive space to combat structural and internalized oppression. We are working towards a world where gender does not determine your confidence, aspirations, and opportunities in life. &#8220;</p>
<p>No surprise that she wants to interview &#8220;white nationalists&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think she should work in a predominantly black school, or live in any city in black Africa and work with real Africans, or live in a black area in Atlanta, for about a year, and then she would have a better starting point for judging those who love white culture and race.</p>
<p>From her blog she has spent some time in the wonderful country of Austria.  I would like her to compare her experience of Austrians and Austrian culture with an experience of blacks and black culture.  She can go ahead and pick whatever is the pinnacle of black culture, whichever black city is the best.  I don&rsquo;t know which one to recommend because all black cities hellholes, but she can evaluate and pick.</p>
<p>Again, that&rsquo;s what she needs to do <i>before</i> she can judge those who love the white race.</p>

		<p>If one&rsquo;s anonymity is preserved (either by Miss Hartman or oneself), I see this as something potentially positive.  When most people hear the words &#8220;white nationalist&#8221;, they think of low class kooks.  This is certainly an opportunity to set someone on the correct path.</p>
<p>Fimbulvet at 8:05 PM - <i>This could either be a friendly and genuine &ldquo;lets get to know and understand WN, and see what their concerns are&rdquo;  &mdash;  or it could be &ldquo;how can we fix and stop these &lsquo;dangerous&rsquo; &lsquo;racist&rsquo; believes from spreading!&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>After four years of Harvard, I would suspect the latter approach.  Still, she may be friendly and good natured about stopping what she sees as bad, as opposed to a zealous crusader for the Thought Police.</p>

		<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m a bit cynical.  But the white-nationalists who show up will more than likely be those who pretend to be WN in order to watch and monitor these groups, having been influenced by the &#8216;what you can do&rsquo; section in books that are assigned right there at Harvard, not to mention the influence of every TV show they&rsquo;ve ever watched.  So it would likely be a &#8216;hard-corps&rsquo; group and perhaps make an interesting spectacle tho without much real to be learned. I would do it tho if I weren&rsquo;t so old.  <br>

		<p>Granted this is cynical assumption, but coming from Harvard U me thinks that she&rsquo;ll probably looking for &#8216;a cure&rsquo;.<br>
Then again a dialogue of some sorts, is better than the usual &#8216;three wise monkeys&rsquo; approach from *the left. </p>
<p>*As leftist ideology now occupies the centre of the political spectrum, to me this makes all commentators under the classification of RW extremist, a default leftist to some degree.</p>
<p>This mainstreaming of a type of extremism in itself, reminds me of the quote &#8220;The Devil&rsquo;s greatest accomplishment was convincing the world he didn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;, in that attitudes that were once thought crazy are now considered &lsquo;natural&rsquo;.<br>
This is Tim Wise and his ilk&rsquo;s plan, which is rolling forward virtually unopposed (present company excluded). <br>
Barring a large scale calamity, eventually a generation will be born into this world of indoctrinated tripe, who&rsquo;ll have no grandparents or great grandparents who can recall ever living in any other type of world themselves, than the current double speak nightmare which we all now endure.  <br>
There&rsquo;ll be nothing to fix, because they&rsquo;ll be no one living with an actual alternative point of reference. </p>
<p>As we know recorded history, can and is so regularly rewritten so casually by today&rsquo;s Marxist academic&rsquo;s out to make a name for themselves, by rebranding a iconic hero from yesteryear into today&rsquo;s coward, closet homosexual, a slave owning bully or a miscegenation practising hypocrite. <br>
By today&rsquo;s ever changing moral standards virtually everyone born fifty years ago +, who was below the rank of saint or martyr, would be considered a monster today (and so Hollywood tells us). </p>
<p>This type of victory by the left is born through suppression of thought and speech and is one of attrition (the longer it all remains like this, the harder it will be to turn around). <br>
The White race is being denied an honourable defeat by a better adversary, instead we&rsquo;ve been tripped up by our own need to gain some moral parity, after being brow beaten by the moral supremacists for over half a century on our (universally human) shortcomings.  <br>
Although we still manage to avoid gaining any positive credit for this desire for atonement as it&rsquo;s probably not happening fast enough. <br>
Never mind the fact that most of our so called historical atrocities are mostly a case of us doing to the other group first, what they&rsquo;d done to us given the opportunity (or inherent capability), so in that sense we&rsquo;re victims of our own success and ability (and now conscious).<br>
    <br>
It doesn&rsquo;t take much to be considered a RW extremist these days; all you have to do is, have had remained consistent in your beliefs for the last few decades.</p>
<p>As the wheel turns no doubt, eventually even today&rsquo;s moderate to middle leftists, will one day be considered (reclassified) RW by tomorrow&rsquo;s Hawaiian shirt wearing, love and tolerance preaching, (we&rsquo;re doing this for the good of &lsquo;the people&rsquo;) fascist progressives.</p>
<p>Better to come over to this side voluntarily, than be pushed over kicking and screaming having been adorned with that dreaded scarlet letter. </p>
<p>Like the famous comment once made by a past (now defunct? hopefully not) Amren conference attendee about the joy of&rdquo; being among the living&rdquo;, I too feel as if I am breathing the freshest of air when partaking in the political incorrect, anything less is mind narrowing, small, fearful (of judgement), restraining, oppressive or suppressive depending on whether the pressure is internal or external in its origins.<br>
To exert internal &lsquo;self censorship&rsquo; of one&rsquo;s own thoughts being the ultimate goal for when the indoctrinated thinks to themselves, and to exert external outward pressure on others when they&rsquo;re sharing their &lsquo;incorrect&rsquo; thoughts aloud. </p>
<p>There is no right or wrong, winning or losing arguments anymore only authorised and unauthorised topics and those who follow the rules and those who break them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no little wonder that &lsquo;the majority&rsquo; gets confused, feels mentally sick or chooses the safe path when thinking about such subjects. I probably sound crazy myself, but I still choose to live in hope that logic will prevail one day before it&rsquo;s too late.<br>
Pardon if this rant has little to do with the original article, or maybe it has everything to do with it.<br>

		<p>Anyone who starts off asking the &#8220;why&#8221; of white nationalism is obviously lacking a crucial moral sense concerning the survival of European racial groups.</p>
<p>This study is going to be used to try to identify the &#8220;ins&#8221; to white nationalism in order to attempt to block our message from reaching the young.  It sounds like a great precursor to making the sequel to American History X.  *gag*</p>
<p>Do yourselves a favor everyone and don&rsquo;t give this school more fuel for their white funeral pyre.</p>

<p>It has always been the Achilles heel of traditionalists to naively impute positive motives to their opponents. This is how many leftists got positions in academia in the first place   &mdash;   at which point they imposed their cultural Marxist agenda.</p>
<p>&#8221;Hatchet job&#8221; would be a polite way of describing what she plans to do. She will be pathologizing anyone she comes into contact with. Remember: she will have editorial control and will be able to twist words and engineer the vision she wants.</p>
<p>This project has zero chance of objectivity and zero chance of being even neutral, let alone positive, towards anyone who participates.</p>

		<p>I would qualify to be a subject in her study as a 21 year old university student. However, there are some major red flags associated with this thesis. First of all, she has omitted the design thesis of her project which means she is either extremely disorganized (not likely), or she is aware of the inherent bias within her project and knows she will get less responses if potential participants know their statements will be used against their side.</p>
<p>I would recommend not responding to this student&rsquo;s request. Her &#8220;thesis&#8221; is more than likely an editorialized liberal rant on the threat of the growing anti-immigration sentiment and the resulting emergence of a white identity. </p>
<p>So, on behalf of myself and others who can discern your purpose, please go away.</p>

		<p>I met a number of intelligent, articulate young college students at the NPI conference two weeks ago. And I&rsquo;ve had considerable contact with two young folks under 30 - Jaenelle Antas &amp; Matt Parrott - who could hold their own against just about anyone, of any age. They and the guys I met at the conference would make impressive subjects for Miss Hartman&rsquo;s research. Perhaps I&rsquo;m naive, but I don&rsquo;t think she is necessarily out to do a hatchet job, although she probably is prejudiced against people with our views. But if we have confidence in our ideas, in their power and truth, then shouldn&rsquo;t this student at our most prestigious and influential university meet some of our best and brightest &#8220;young guns?&#8221; Who knows, we might convert her to our side, or at least put a serious dent in her (presumed) liberal arrogance about the facts of race. </p>

		<p>There is no way on earth I would ever trust this Miss Hartman. I know all about the informed consent process, we&rsquo;ll protect your privacy, blah, blah, blah. I still don&rsquo;t trust these people, especially from Harvard. </p>
<p>Anyway, they always tell you that your answers are not linked to you personally. Well, yes, if the people in charge of the study have integrity. However, every interview has an ID number, so if someone with no scruples really wanted to know who you are they could find out. </p>
<p>Lastly, this thing about 45 minutes to an hour is nonsense. Think one hour to an hour and a half, maybe more. I&rsquo;ve been doing surveys for some years now. They always under estimate the time, otherwise no one would do them. As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m currently working on one that says it will take 30-60 minutes. Some of them go over 2 hours. </p>

		<p>What motivates people to join White Nationalism is very simple just so you know.  It is the perceived injustices executed upon white people by people who do not have their best interests at heart.  There are many specifics:<br>
Diversity hiring practices which are perceived to favor those who are not straight, white, or male.  These practices are perceived as doubly difficult when done by the government in contravention of constitutional bans on discrimination which are perceived not to apply vis a vis white males.<br>
Governmental behavior perceived to be designed to harm the white family.  Easy divorces, legalized morality crimes, abortion, etc. are perceived to have damaged the white nuclear family.<br>
The perceived existence of a foe who is determined to destroy white people who are innocent of any crime:  feminists such as Susan Sonntag who once called suburbs &#8220;Christian breeding grounds&#8221;, nonwhites who perceive everything whites do as racist, and bias crimes which do not apply when nonwhites commit bias crimes but apply to a white preacher preaching about homosexuality, which are then perceived as attempts to criminalize whites who commit no crime.</p>
<p>The list of perceived attacks on white people is very long in the white nationalist community.  You should be able to find them and  judge for yourself pretty easily on the internet.  Good luck to  you and I hope you will approach this subject as an open minded scientist and accept whatever truth you find.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting the links, Commenter #3.</p>
<p>Her HS data sheet says she&rsquo;s a whiz at Physics.</p>
<p>But the above states that she is a sociology student working on her senior thesis.  How do you go from physics to sociology?</p>
<p>All I can figure is maybe a really, really heavy box of electrons fell off a shelf while she was in physics lab, and hit her in the head, leaving her with a mild concussion.  Such that, she is now unable to differentiate between the various Mannheim scales on her slide rule.  Which - in turn - would lead to a change of declared Major at Harvard.</p>
<p>The email address is suspect: @fas.harvard.edu.  You go through fas before you get Keri.</p>
<p>Tell you what, Keri.  Why don&rsquo;t you change the subject of your thesis to: Why do Black People like to kill White people so much?</p>
<p>Google &#8216;Eve Carson&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Google &#8216;Wichita Massacre&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Google &#8216;Censorbugbear&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Google &#8216;GenocideWatch&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Question for you, Keri.  How many recognized stages of genocide exist?</p>
<p>Another question: At what number stage have the white people of Southern Africa been placed?</p>
<p>The United Nations has its own office that deals with genocide.  You might contact them or Genocide Watch, I think GW is hooked up with the UN.  These people are not nutters.</p>

What I think is going on here is that she wants to find out how people turn in to racists so they can figure out how to fight against the process. What I can&rsquo;t figure out is how white people turn in to Liberals.     </p>

I realize that American Renaissance has been experiencing some technical difficulties, and has lost some comments, but this appears to be something different.

Two weeks ago, I got a message saying, &#8220;Your correspondence could not be delivered due to a technical malfunction involving your server.&#8221; Yet all my other e-mails to family and friends got through the same server without a hitch. The message I received had the letters OIT and a string of numbers/letters at the bottom. I am quite ignorant about computers, and perhaps I&rsquo;m just being paranoid, but for the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been inundated with spam containing links to articles regarding &#8220;hate speech&#8221;. I have had a first-rate firewall installed on my computer and I never open correspondence from folks I don&rsquo;t know, but this has spooked me. If this comment gets through, can someone please tell me what I am doing wrong?</p>

		<p>Remember, the individual is not received into one of these so-called institutions of higher learning unless they &ldquo;sing a certain tune&rdquo; and show a certain way of thinking.  Any type data may be manipulated for certain results.  I would venture to guess, Ms. Hartman has already made up her mind as to the results she is after and the outcome that must be produced.  These type young people sell their souls and their race to please the gods of multiculturalism.  Thus, I suspect any accumulated information, as to the project, will be moved into the &ldquo;Bad Whitey&rdquo; syndrome.  Personally, I do not trust the project, the person, or the institution.</p>
<p>I would also state that Ms. Hartman will, most probably, read the comments/posts written on this site.</p>
<p>Now to a different thought.  If this young lady is of European/Nordic stock, can one imagine what she could accomplish for her race?  No, she would never receive the fancy Ph.D. from Harvard; however, she could look herself in the mirror each morning and realize what a wonderful and magnificent race she has been blessed to belong within (a culture of the ages: to the Egyptian to the Greek to the Roman to the European and European American and forward).  Some races need a month of recognition; Ms. Hartman, our race resides within the Encyclopedia Britannica.  She could look herself in the mirror each morning and realize that this country was established for only her and only her race (European Americans/Europeans) by her Founding Fathers (European Americans/Europeans).  If Ms. Hartman had cultivated the European American/European racially aware mindset, one can only imagine and dream of what she could accomplish for her race. <br>

		<p>If I was the right age group, and the right nationality, I would participate in this study. Obviously the researcher knows nothing about her research subject, and is unlikely to have much academic integrity, and wants to demonise white nationalists. But she&rsquo;s going to do that anyway, so you might as well contribute some facts to the research. Some facts will leak out, and whatever science we can put out there is good. I&rsquo;m a strong believer in contributing to scientific research wherever possible, even if the researchers are flawed. They probably will at least protect your confidentiality, since that is one principle academics still follow (because it&rsquo;s a humanitarian principle, not a scientific one).</p>

<p>Thanks to #3 Anonymous at 7:31 PM for gathering the background info on Keri. We get who you are, Keri.</p>
<p>Her offer to AmRen is dripping with the usual elitist liberal smug condescension. You can just hear her saying &#8220;well of course we know that the old white nationalists are just a bunch of bitter holdovers from America&rsquo;s racist past, but what could possibly motivate someone my age to be so horrible and nasty?!&#8221; That might as well be the name of her project.</p>
<p>Before I agreed to work with her (and I most likely never would no matter what) I would ask to see some of her other writing. Does she show any familiarity at all with the issues that concern people who speak up for white interests? It shouldn&rsquo;t be your job to educate her, nor should you walk into a situation where you will be used as a two-dimensional caricature for Harvard&rsquo;s typical shoddy, grade-inflated, undergraduate wankery.</p>
<p>And Keri, if you&rsquo;re reading this, here&rsquo;s one little article, just one little recent news story, to set you on what for you is going to be a long, long path towards understanding why so many average American white people look towards pro-white news sources like AmRen to find out what&rsquo;s really going on in this country:</p>
<p>http://bit.ly/pqdlG7</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re one of the privileged elite. You need to start your research where most white people in this country actually live, and what they face in their daily lives. </p>

<p>Young Miss Hartman isn&rsquo;t doing this to give you a &#8220;voice.&#8221;  She isn&rsquo;t doing this to find out what white nationalists are or what makes them tick. There isn&rsquo;t any objectivity in this type of research.  </p>

<p>Please understand that what she is doing is not scientific research; that it is not done with any intention of discovering truth.

She might be setting up the White Advocacy movement by obtaining as much information about us as possible and then giving this information to the anti-white people. Then, the anti-white people will frame future attacks against us with this information they were given by our people.</p>

Those that are sympathetic to the WN cause, but haven&rsquo;t contacted us yet, might read her paper and agree with our arguements. I know years ago I always tuned into talk shows or read books about WN groups because despite the negative light they were cast in, I understood the WN points. Many white people reading her paper will only be interested in what you say not any negative comments and conclusions that she attaches to you after the interview. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t sound like she is looking to argue or ambush a WN during the conversation so just state your views very reasonably and clearly and tell your story. Don&rsquo;t get sucked into a petty argument about fine details or issues that don&rsquo;t mean much (ie, the old talk show host baited question &#8220;how do you decide who is white? If you can&rsquo;t do this, white people don&rsquo;t exist and you are simply a blind hater&#8221;)</p>

		<p>Most of the posters here think that Ms. Hartmann is looking for race conscious whites so that she can tear them apart in her paper, and considering what Harvard is like these days, I tend to agree. Schools like Harvard originally got their excellent reputations by passing on Western culture and adding to it, but today they&rsquo;re amongst the institutions which promote displacing the white people who created that culture. I found an article about Harvard&rsquo;s entrance requirements back in 1892 at http://goo.gl/L28bT. </p>
<p>Amongst other things, the students needed a knowledge of four foreign languages to get in. It&rsquo;s a sad example as to how the educational system has been dumbed down when you think that today, many high school graduates are illiterate.     </p>

This is a fight for liberation and survival  &mdash;  go, speak  &mdash;  and if one narcotized liberal begins to see the light because of you  &mdash;  that is a major step on the road for victory. </p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing: She will do her study and get her grade and then no one will read it again. It might be covered in the media because it will fit &#8220;the narrative&#8221; for a hit piece on whites and hoping for the authorities to initiate a new round of indoctrination ala University of Delaware resident program. </p>
<p>All good, except the shelf life of this effort has long since reached the stage of diminishing returns and will soon expire outright. It is already showing signs of it and the proof of it is in the topic of the paper itself, YOUNG White Nationalists. </p>
<p>Hence some Harvard thesis adviser noticed that a growing number of youths are being more vocal about their white nationalism and perhaps a great many are in agreement but silent and fears for those right-thinking white deracinates who might be at risk of ingesting the poison. So she sicks one of her young aspirants on us, enter Miss Hartman, and instructs her to shelve the vinegar and use honey to attract the filthy WN flies. Clumsily I might add.</p>
<p>My take is that this will amount to nothing I hope some of our brighter, young college WNs will take the opportunity to pull her chain and have a little fun with the little dummy. Maybe two or more of them could team up and spin her around a bit. Not even that is worth the time but it might be fun if you have a couple of hours to kill.</p>

I said I was split on this because I thought it might give intelligent White Nationalist a platform however I would strongly urge caution in aiding and abetting the enemy.</p>
<p>Social science experiments are never what they are stated to be.</p>
<p>When I was in college, I used to participate in the experiments that offered money (5 or even 10 a shot).</p>
<p>The researcher would always tell me what the experiment was supposed to test. However, there was always a hidden aspect to the research. They tell you they&rsquo;re researching A when in fact they&rsquo;re researching B. Halfway into the session, it would become obvious what they were really researching.</p>
<p>Think of the experiments where they asked people to test peoples memory by giving unseen strangers shocks. The experiment had nothing to do with memory but were designed to test how easily people could be made to obey commands.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that this person isn&rsquo;t looking to understand White Nationalists. What she&rsquo;s looking for is information that can tell her and her comrades how White Nationalists learn to be racists, at what stage, and how much home environment plays a role.</p>
<p>The findings will likely be used to find a link between early childhood and developing &#8216;racist&rsquo; views. The goal is likely to be finding early intervention methods to counter &#8216;racist&rsquo; upbringing.</p>
<p>To them, people are nothing more than lab rats and they are always looking for new ways to manipulate us.</p>
<p>As much as I might be tempted to express my views, I wouldn&rsquo;t participate. </p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ll email Mz. &#8216;I used to be a Physics Major, but I switched to Sociology, because it&rsquo;s so much easier and the only requirement is that you have to be a Stepford Wife leftist&rsquo; just for the heck of it. Or she can email me - my email&rsquo;s up there.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Somewhere behind the curtain there is a professor who is coaching her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think more the ADL or SPLC or even FBI or ATF.</p>
<p>I did send her an email telling her that I am too old to participate but that there is no White Nationalist movement.</p>
<p>A movement actually does something.  We have no money, no organizations, no real program.  All we can do is talk to each other and try to raise consciousness of other Whites.</p>
<p>The only Whites who have done any  thing for the last 40 years are White police and fire departments that filed driscrimination lawsuits.  Whether they won or lost, there is still discrimination against Whites in all goverment jobs. I mispoke.  It&rsquo;s not discrimination, it is a total ban.</p>
<p>The various anti affirmative initiatives at state level were always passed.  Absolutely nothing however, was ever done to enforce them.  Prop 209 in California passed and has never, never been enforced. One reason is that federal law supersedes state law and federal mandates no Whites need apply.</p>
<p>I really think that Prop 209 and the anti affirmative action iniatives were controlled opposition to make Whites believe there was hope that the discrimination against us would stop.</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t.  I didn&rsquo;t bother to check her out.  She is a woman.  She is at Harvard.  That says it all.</p>
<p>PHD in sociology?  There are thousands of sociology PHDs out there and only abut 15 job openings a year.  The openings are mostly non tenured part time.</p>
<p>Could be that she has been promised an actual job if she can entrap some Whites into using the N word or talking about guns and the constitution.  Then ADL FBI SPLC ATF charges them with hate speech. </p>
<p>The Russians did this after WW2 when there still some resistance movements in their newly aquired countries in Eastern Europe.<br>
The local communists set up dissident groups, drew all the dissidents in and them executed them.</p>
<p>Standard lefty tactic.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get in touch.  Most of all, stay away from those northwest homeland gun rights groups.  They are all either creations of ADL SPLC FBI ATF or throughly infiltrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&rsquo;m a bit cynical. But the white-nationalists who show up will more than likely be those who pretend to be WN in order to watch and monitor these groups, having been influenced by the &lsquo;what you can do&rsquo; section in books that are assigned right there at Harvard, not to mention the influence of every TV show they&rsquo;ve ever watched. So it would likely be a &lsquo;hard-corps&rsquo; group and perhaps make an interesting spectacle tho without much real to be learned. I would do it tho if I weren&rsquo;t so old. &#8220;</p>
<p>Good observation.  This suggests the likely outcome that she will produce a paper without vetting the submission.  This means that a black woman who might hang a noose on her own door, or a black man who impersonates a K cross burning or mailed threat could easily impersonate a &#8220;White Nationalist.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that brings up another thought since I first posted (#1) on this issue.  How will she guarantee that her interviewers are under 30 or over 18?  I agree with those who suppose that she doesn&rsquo;t want to interview well educated and experienced whites who will no doubt out match her on the subject.  She operates on a set of contrived &#8220;ethics&#8221; that tell her to deceive and exploit her subject on the claimed moral ground and &#8220;testagonistic&#8221; goals (a term I coined).  She deserves to be deceived by 40-50 year old white realists.  So the alternative to ignoring her and her obvious aims for pursuing her project is to out maneuver her by sending her classic AR articles, a copy of &#8220;Why Race Matters&#8221; and any number of other well prepared materials such as &#8220;The Color of Crime,&#8221; on either the White Nationalist/separatist, and race realism issues and even consider impersonating her chosen age group of interview victims.</p>
<p>We have her address.  She is a naive liberal whose boldness is buoyed via an assumption of righteousness.  She should see all delivery services several times a week delivering diverse reading material to her.</p>
<p>Of course, I recommend that such material be more on objective experience and historical misconceptions rather than arguments based in emotional objections such as religious ones.</p>
<p>As an aside, it would be interesting to learn of her sexual orientation/dating habits.</p>

		<p>It might be very revealing  how thoroughly she is acquainted with the work regarding personality and politics done by H. J. Eysenck and some of his students, reaching back into the 1950&rsquo;s. It is, of course, beside the point what conclusion she has about the value of such work, but a failure to know of it thoroughly would be a &#8220;pink flag&#8221; . Perhaps the greatest psychologist of the second half of the 20th century (?), Eysenck has often been closely studied and often not  cited in the US  &mdash;  often not mentioned from the lectern but eagerly discussed in confidential private conversation.  That&rsquo;s about as fine a commendation as one can have earned in contemporary America.  Among scholars crediting Eysenck with early and favorable influence upon their work are Arthur Jensen and Christopher Brand.   <br>

		<p>I am not as cynical as the rest of you guys. Sure, she could piece together our beliefs by reading the comments of sites like this, but she wants personal stories, character portraits, and the like. My guess is that while she may not lay awake at night contemplating the morals and philosophy of white nationalism, she is not going to twist your words to write a vicious smear-piece either; she just wants some fluff.</p>
<p>I happen to be a twenty-something white nationalist, and an American, but I don&rsquo;t know, I guess I&rsquo;m not the sort who wants the attention of strangers, unless it is for an accomplishment-which is perhaps even less mainstream than white nationalism! So no thanks, Ms. Hartman, but I am happy to provide you with some white nationalism cliff notes.</p>
<p>Defined most broadly, American white nationalists are American whites who reject the dominant ideology of the American establishment: Universalism, defined here as the belief all peoples have the same biological capabilities, and so with right effort, all can, and should, be made to have the same values, and to display the same achievement in all areas of human endeavor. Some (people whom I myself would not consider white nationalists) think that Universalism is a nice ideal, but that racial genetic differences doom it to failure, i.e. that some groups are more violent and less intelligent than us, and will ruin our comfortable society if they become too great a portion of our population. Others reject Universalism as an ideal, and believe that even if all groups were equally capable in every way, it would still be preferable to live in a society whose basis for being is the shared ethnicity of its citizens (ethnicity here defined as one race sharing the same land, language, and customs). They (we) think that man needs, and deserves, a group identity, that the state should be the political expression of the group, and that a blood-based group identity is the most lasting form of identity, so the state should be, at least partly, blood-based. </p>
<p>Of course, most white nationalists are somewhere in between these two extremes; I think that the typical white nationalist believes in the ethno-state as the ideal, and believes that the races have inherently different capabilities, and the belief in the latter only strengthens the beauty of the former. Indeed, so long as all the advantages are not with one race, or all the disadvantages with another, and it does not appear that they are, we would argue that inherently different capabilities is ideal. And if that is the case, the etho-state is all the better because it is not just the home of an extended-family, but, potentially, the expression of its unique genetics, out of which develops a unique value system, and within which the individual is most able and most willing to live up to the society&rsquo;s ideal.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that we have far more to gain than to lose in discussing our views with those who don&rsquo;t think like us. I can&rsquo;t imagine the paper would be positive about us, but it can at least look at those of us who are more well-spoken. The better input we have, the less negative and more neutral the final product may be.</p>
<p>And let us not forget that Jared Taylor himself was a conventional liberal until around the age of 30 when it comes to race. It&rsquo;s unlikely that we&rsquo;d win her over, but we can show people like her and those that would read her report that we&rsquo;re not all a bunch of complete cranks, and that our worldview is shaped more by the love of our people rather than the hatred of non-whites. Our future success is shaped not just by the level of adversarial thoughts out there but by their intensity as well.</p>

		<p>Not applicable to me, because I&rsquo;m outside the age range (unfortunately, in the upward direction, and I can&rsquo;t seem to get the clock to slow down.)  But I would do it.  I know her report will be a hatchet job, and I know (in fact, I can confirm) that my name is on a list somewhere.  Therefore, why not poison their well with a few slick quotes and paragraphs?  Sure, I&rsquo;d spend a week or two at the Jared Taylor Public Relations Boot Camp before taking part, but I think it would be worth it.</p>

		<p>I understand many are worried about being exposed and being put on a government list, but how many here suscribe to Am Ren or CofCC or Nationalist Times (etc) papers? </p>
<p>The CofCC and Nationalist Times don&rsquo;t do anything to hide their papers when they mail them to my house and I have been a subscriber for almost a decade. So if there is a list, I&rsquo;m sure the US Postal service already has me on it.</p>
<p>But we need to quit hiding and pretending that we are doing something wrong. That alone shows how much the mulitcultural establishment has won. Remember it&rsquo;s not illegal to speak out against immigration and for white interests. Some care is required of course, (don&rsquo;t talk about politics to much at work and don&rsquo;t advocate anything illegal), but don&rsquo;t cower in fear either. We like to claim that &#8220;most white people privately agree with our views&#8221; so if we really believe that why not come part way (or all the way) out of the closet? For those of you feel that nobody will listen to you, here is your chance to tell your story. Just be careful and don&rsquo;t say anything really stupid.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a few years too old, otherwise I might contact her. Mike, #51 also had a good point that her paper might be read a few times and never read again and amount to nothing anyway. In that case it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the outcome of her paper is.</p>

		<p>I submit that the race-intellectual abilities issue is a massive distraction away from the fundamental White Nationalist-Native Born White American Patriot issue which is:race-replacement at the hand of of hostile post-1965 nonwhites and separation from the native black population. The race war has already started..if would have gone hot if John McCain had won the election on Nov 4 2008. The idea that White Nationalists are going to have a prolonged psychometric discussion-debate  with blacks about scores on a IQ test is greatest pile of nonesense in the world. The time devoted to a discussion-debate about race and scores on IQ test will completely block a out a discusssion of the race-replacement issue..the two are completely incompatible&hellip;I will debte any IQ test score enthusiasts on this point..it is a fact. The reason why Steve Sailer has such a massive obsession with the race-IQ test score issue is because he fantasizes that a race war can be avoided if we can have  Charles Murray policy wonk discussion with blacks,hispanics,asians and muslims about the policy wonk consequences of the race-IQ test score issue&hellip;complete fanatasy&hellip;.magical thinking&hellip;&#8221;Citizenship&#8221; variety.</p>
<p>Focusing on the race-IQ test score issue will not rally our fellow Native Born White Americans into a full-blown race-revolt against their race-replacement at the hands of hostile and high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. The focus of Native Born White American Patriots must be on the horrific consequences of the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act</p>

i voiced our concerns about it being just more demonization and i thinks she was a tiny bit offended, she said:&#8221;well if i really wanted to do that i could just go with what i have.&#8221; which i took to mean what her professors tell her. she sounds nice, we had a short chat about videogames and stuff. she phrased her approach thus:&#8221;i understand that people live their lives in what way makes sense to them and i am interested in why this makes sense to you.&#8221; and i get the feeling that she is genuinely looking for answers and trying to understand our point of view. she also said that it was the first time she had been flamed on the internet. i warned her to reinforce and barricade her door and to expect the violence we have to deal with.<br>
she will call me back on monday afternoon. i think we will have an interesting chat about White Guilt and White ethnic culture, and our right to have our own non-mainstream opinions. i will ask her about the athena project. i want to talk about the value of relating to others in order to get along:how it is important, psychoplogically,for people to find common ground.</p>

<p>Social science experiments are never what they are stated to be.</p>
<p>When I was in college, I used to participate in the experiments that offered money (5 or even 10 a shot).</p>
<p>The researcher would always tell me what the experiment was supposed to test. However, there was always a hidden aspect to the research. They tell you they&rsquo;re researching A when in fact they&rsquo;re researching B. Halfway into the session, it would become obvious what they were really researching.</p>
<p>Think of the experiments where they asked people to test peoples memory by giving unseen strangers shocks. The experiment had nothing to do with memory but were designed to test how easily people could be made to obey commands.</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that this person isn&rsquo;t looking to understand White Nationalists. What she&rsquo;s looking for is information that can tell her and her comrades how White Nationalists learn to be racists, at what stage, and how much home environment plays a role.</p>
<p>The findings will likely be used to find a link between early childhood and developing &lsquo;racist&rsquo; views. The goal is likely to be finding early intervention methods to counter &lsquo;racist&rsquo; upbringing.</p>
<p>To them, people are nothing more than lab rats and they are always looking for new ways to manipulate us.</p>
<p>As much as I might be tempted to express my views, I wouldn&rsquo;t participate. &#8220;</p>
<p>A lot of people here seem to want to impress her or even trick themselves as if she is wanting to listen to your stories. How stupid can you be?</p>
<p>The woman wrote that her proudest moment in her life was to arrange the first multicultural festival at her school. <br>
She&rsquo;s a sociology major.</p>
<p>What do you think? She will give you a fair hearing? The hatchet job is seen miles away, and even if she doesn&rsquo;t want to do it, she has many profs who are total marxists and will never accept anything but a total smear.</p>
<p>Besides, as the commentator above put it, it&rsquo;s very likely she isn&rsquo;t out to &#8216;understand&rsquo; anything. It&rsquo;s more like you are the ginny pigs in her experiment. She probably wants to &#8216;stop racism&rsquo; by going into your life and try to build a theory of how you went astray of the multicultural paradise paradigm in the first place and then try to stop future generations of young whites going the journey that you did.</p>
<p>Whatever you are saying, it will be used against us in the future. You are her lab rats. Never think anything else.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t be an idiot. And do not try to impress, because they don&rsquo;t care. These people want to exploit and pride is a good way to get there.</p>

Any advice to someone who may meet with her? I am thinking of doing but staying anonymous. </p>
<p>She wants to do an interview doesn&rsquo;t she?  The only way to keep safe is to go to a public library and set up a free hotmail account.  Always use the public library to communicate with her.</p>
<p>Those IIP adresses can be traced to your home and work computers.<br>
Someone recently posted that his email address was traced through a comment he made on some website.</p>
<p>His employer was notified of his impure speech and thought and he was fired for whatever website on which he posted.</p>
<p>ATF and FBI are limited in what they can do.  ADL and SPLC are not.  </p>
<p>If you do communicate with her, I&rsquo;d advise never mentioning the words, guns, 2nd amendment, Jew, Christianity, abortion, gay issues, America, patriotism northwest homeland, school integration, judges, Obama or anything but affirmative action discrimination and black on White crime.<br>

<p>I used to do surveys. The company often combined 3 or 4 surveys in one.  The surveys were a set series of questions and answers.<br>
The respondents could not create their own answers or expound on an answer.  They had to pick one of 5 or 6 answers.</p>
<p>Her survey might not be like this, but I did those phone surveys for years and not one allowed the respondent to do anything but pick which already written answer.</p>

See how she responds.  That she can&rsquo;t use it in a direct sense is understood from the outset. That she would discard or dismiss it would be awkward for her.  What you have to look out for is the use by her of cookie cut categories that manage to ignore THESE relevant facts while overemphasizing THOSE relevant facts.

		<p>I can only echo the sentiments above. While it might be seen by some as a great opportunity to get WN ideas discussed in the upper reaches of Harvard, it&rsquo;s not like they have never heard of us or what we think before- indeed, our ideas are the exact ones that if uttered will spell the end of an academic career.</p>
<p>They can find out all about us and what we think from the websites mentioned. Those websites have been there a long time, and everything on them is absolute anathema to their encapsulated, textbook-dictated worldview.</p>
<p>The reason this study is being run is so people like Hartmann, who has likely never lived near blacks who weren&rsquo;t employed by her family or college, can present ways to combat our recruitment.</p>
<p>The expected response is that the inquisitive young nationalist sought answers online to questions such as &#8220;Why are blacks so violent&#8221; or similar, and found answers that assumed the least and explained the most right here and on other sites such as VDARE.</p>
<p>Her proposal, therefore, which will be passed around the halls of Harvard, a place where many would-be politicians are educated, will be to crack down on &#8220;hate sites&#8221; and ensure that only the contorted lies of the Left are presented to searchers on the Net.</p>
<p>tl;dr version- she&rsquo;s out to make a case for censorship on the Net, through large numbers of responses mentioning Web searches or the Internet in general.</p>

<p>Oh, dear!  Someone please help this girl.  Sorry, continue.</p>
<p><b>&hellip; for my senior thesis on young people who are active in the American white nationalist movement. I am most interested in understanding what motivates young people to participate in these movements, as well as how their participation influences their process of growing up.</b></p>
<p>Do you realize how condescending that sounds?  So a white person that isn&rsquo;t politically correct isn&rsquo;t &#8216;grown up&rsquo;?  I&rsquo;ve noticed quite the opposite.  Why do you assume whites who are pro-white and not comfortable around blacks just came to that conclusion out of nowhere?  Why not interview young black nationalists?  Did you come up with the questions and terms on your own, or did your professor?</p>
<p><b>Because I want to give young people involved in the movement the chance to tell their own stories and to put their perspectives out there,</b></p>
<p>And are you going to show their interview in full, or edit certain parts out to make them look the usual pro-white stereotype of a child molestor, toothless, uneducated, crazy, paranoid, etc?</p>
<p><b> I am conducting interviews with young people ages 18-30 who identify as white nationalists. I wanted to reach out to you and see if any members of the Council of Conservative Citizens who fit my criteria would be willing to speak with me. All answers (as well as the name of the group) would be anonymized in my thesis, and the interview would take 45 minutes to an hour. I am located in Boston, MA, but would be more than happy to set something up via phone or Skype.</b></p>
<p>So you promise you&rsquo;re not going to use these interviews to put these young pro-white people on a list or show it to future employers or so other &#8216;liberal&rsquo; people can harrass them?  You&rsquo;re not going to try to tell them they are &#8216;stupid&rsquo; or &#8216;uneducated&rsquo; for not being a self-hating white person today like they&rsquo;ve been brainwashed to be?<br>

<p>If we whites ever recover our perspective, that&rsquo;s the question that will suggest itself to future students of our era.</p>
<p>By what actions have our media, schools, government and other institutions been taken over and become the sources of the trance that directs the minds of young Whites toward their own destruction?</p>
<p>In what ways has the poison of the multicult injured &#8220;their process of growing up&#8221;? Having to attend schools integrated with rowdy, hostile, and dangerous blacks who are uninterested in and incapable of learning? Being denied admission to college or denied college scholarships in favor of less qualified blacks? Being passed over for hiring or promotion in favor of less qualified blacks? Succumbing to the constant portrayal of interracial coupling in our media and marrying a black to their everlasting regret? </p>
<p>Future generations will want to know the details of how the multicult poison was injected into our minds, social structures, and body politic. So turn your looking glass in the right direction, Ms. Hartman.</p>

 I get death threats from Mexicans for posting about their crimes all the time. Why doesnt she really put herself on the line and interview the Mexican Drug Cartel?<br>

She just rolled over the part where the 10 year old son had a problem from since he was born.( A child of a former spouse of Jeff&rsquo;s) As a youngster he set fires, was a problem in schools WAY before Jeff ever became NS! Yet she wants to make it all out that it was nazism that did it to the kid. Jeff&rsquo;s sister and his mother did him no favor by saying what they said either. They kind of did a great disservice to their son and brother who is now dead. Shame on them. Was that all prearranged? </p>
<p>Poor little Lesley was so appalled and shocked that they wanted all nonwhites out of America! Yet, nary a word, when Mexico, Israel, Asian countries, etc. all have and KEEP their homelands from invading aliens. Right, Leslie? Maybe you can air a show like that sometime. Be sure to put on all those black, hispanic voices that yell &#8220;kill the White race&#8221;, eh, Lesley?  I will be waiting&hellip;.</p>

I would think it legally risky for some organization such as ADL or SPLC to hack a system or get the info from an employee of the system (that much, I can easily imagine them doing, since the ADL has been revealed in court of doing such things) and giving such info to an employer.

		<p>We are at war and this is the enemy.  Save your dialogue for conservative-minded people.  You will never convince the radicals like this woman and your arguments won&rsquo;t reach others through her.  Bear in mind that Jared Taylor is not making arguments to the Neo-Marxists. When he speaks, he is speaking to us.  He is articulating and supporting what we might naturally feel anyway.  He is not trying to convince the enemy and neither should you.</p>

<i>Someone please ask her what aroused her interest to the point that she picked this topic over all the many others that some one having her interests could have chosen, and what hypotheses are behind her odd (?) question about growing up. </i></p>
<p>This is PURE speculation on my part.</p>
<p>I suspect she was at one of her mult-CULT festivals surround by her majority White comrades with a few diversity tokens thrown in and she had an epiphany. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t I do my thesis on Nazis?&rsquo; Her White friends were likely shocked. She thought it would be a laugh.</p>
<p>You are not enlightened by the &lsquo;joys of diversity&rsquo; like her and her friends. She doesn&rsquo;t want to understand you. She sees you as mentally ill and maybe even dangerous. She wants to understand you only so much as she wants to find a way to cure you.</p>
<p>If she really wants to know what makes a White Nationalist, she should move to a majority black or Hispanic community. If she&rsquo;s White and honest with herself, she&rsquo;ll come to understand these are not her people, they do not share her values, and some of them are a physical threat to her personal safety.</p>
<p>If she wants a quick lesson, she can ride a subway without her friends in a black neighborhood for one night.</p>
<p>I suspect that&rsquo;s something she would never do but in her mind, not because she&rsquo;s a racists</p>

		<p>Since no one has mentioned it, isn&rsquo;t it telling that she choose to hang out in Vienna, Austria, a nationalist enclave in Europe that has been electing more and more conservative leaders lately?  Her blogs seem to revolve around interest as a tourist, not a researcher.  My impression, especially since reading the post by the one white (female) who is apparently speaking to her, is that she has a great deal to learn about herself before she goes about attempting to dissect and understand others.  Based on what she has presented, I doubt that her thesis would be on the level of the usual Tim Wise diatribe.</p>

		<p>I had two experiences with Ivy Leaguers, one from Yale and another from Yale via Harvard.</p>
<p>The Yalie came to my Viet Nam veterans&rsquo; discussion group to &#8220;interview&#8221; us about our opinions regarding the causes and results of that war.  It took about five minutes of her &#8220;interviewing&#8221; before she got tired of listening to ignorant vets and launched into her own lecture on how and why we got into the war, in which Americans who supported the war came out as stupid, paranoid, kneejerk anti-communists, as opposed to the enlightened understanding she&rsquo;d absorbed at the feet of her New Left profs.    </p>
<p>The Harvard guy, a long ago housemate, just would not shut his mouth, and was always ready with an anti-American, anti-white slur.  One of the many outrageous things I could mention about him was how he would carry on about how he hated &#8220;lily white&#8221; skin and thought brown and black women were oh so much more attractive.  He had done a lot of traveling in Latin American and Caribbean countries while on the lam from the draft, see, had had all kinds of black/brown chicks, talked about the superiority of their lovemaking, and felt the pain of their oppression - all the while he&rsquo;s screwing &#8216;em and leaving &#8216;em!</p>
<p>He married a bright little Yale law student, who had golden locks and dazzling pearly white skin.       </p>

		<p>Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s very possible that she has already come to conclusions and may and most likely will construe your answers to match up with her bias. </p>
<p>For example, if you say that you are a WN because you knew a white girl from your school have a child with a black man, then she may say in her paper that you are suffering from internalized sexual guilt. </p>
<p>If you do agree to the interview be prepared to answer very sensitive questions, for instance, &#8220;What is your opinion of Hitler?&#8221; Some questions will be designed to have no right answers.</p>

		<p>The only thing somewhat similar to this in recent history that I can remember is that one Amy Cotter, (I deliberately misspelled her last name, its real misspelling might make this post a spam post), a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan, is doing (she might have finished it by now) her sociology dissertation on the modern American militia movement.  The differences here are that Cotter is doing a Ph.D. thesis while Hartman is doing an undergrad senior project, albeit in the same field, but a Ph.D. dissertation is going to get way more scrutiny ceteris paribus than a senior thesis, and Cotter had/has no obvious history of biases for or against her study subject, while Hartmann plainly does, and Cotter is studying an aracial or sometimes anti-racist movement, while Hartmann is actually studying people who willingly adopt white nationalism as a political goal.</p>

		<p>Although I previously recommended young WNs talk to her (#25), I have to admit being impressed by the arguments against doing so presented by other commenters. Especially the ones predicting the names of any WN talking to her, &#8220;anonymously&#8221; or not, will eventually be publicized and used to ruin the educational and career prospects of these young people. </p>
<p>The argument that, because Jared Taylor talks to our enemies, young WNs should too, is bogus. I&rsquo;m certain Jared Taylor, already established in life, already the author of one well-received book (The Japanese Miracle and Peril), knew the risks he would run and the price he would pay (and indeed he has paid a heavy price many times) for speaking out about race. In contrast, the people this young lady wants to interview are just starting their adult lives, mere fledglings, who can easily be destroyed in more ways than I can think of by exposing them as race realists. Post #103 by sbuffalonative sums it up best, &#8220;She sees you as mentally ill and maybe even dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, I don&rsquo;t join the ranks of those saying absolutely don&rsquo;t talk. I do, however, urge each of our young friends to consider very carefully what you are willing to risk, and to lose, if you are tempted to respond.</p>

		<p>#93: your point about Ivy League education not being the end of the mind appears rather botched. George Gilder, after doing some good work on the negative consequences of feminism back in the 70s, became a fanatical open-borders libertarian &amp; worshipper of capitalism. Lately he&rsquo;s been a worshipper of Israel with all that implies. Dinesh D&rsquo;Souza is the Sri Lankan who destroyed Sam Francis&rsquo;s career as a nation-wide columnist, and got him fired from the WASHINGTON TIMES, by smearing him as a drooling racist after D&rsquo;Souza was offended by Sam&rsquo;s speech at an American Renaissance conference he attended.</p>
<p>Out of the three examples you cite - Gilder, D&rsquo;Souza, Taylor - only Jared turned out well. The other two are our enemies, and D&rsquo;Souza did all of us harm by hurting Sam Franics. </p>

<p>I think it is more likely that a few years from now, Keri will write one of those &#8220;I went to the ghetto and they didn&rsquo;t like me&#8221; articles that gets posted here every few months.</p>

Most Whites won&rsquo;t ever say the reason they were fired, either. There is no freedom of speech in this country if you are White and the subject is race. They claim there are providers that do not give that info out, but I find that very dubious to say the least. I guess there are many ways for those in the know, how to do it.</p>

		<p>Our race is more trusting because we had to work together to get the better of the less hospitable climes from which we sprang. It really is amazing how good an answer to such issues race-based evolutionary psychology is, as I said above (I was poster 91) it assumes the least about the world, and explains nearly every racial differential. </p>
<p>Leftist explanations such as &#8220;the great White conspiracy&#8221; and &#8220;low expectations lead to low results&#8221; assume the most preposterous things and at best half-explain the results of one kind of test.</p>
<p>I would say again, DON&rsquo;T COOPERATE WITH THIS STUDY. If you can find a place to organise, you could arrange to give a set of internally consistent but completely fictitious answers- cite secret initiations into a Masonic conspiracy, cite a secret wing of the Democrat party that never gave up segregation, hell, you could even tell them that Hilary Clinton is a Grand Wizard in the K who personally recruited you through &#8220;codewords&#8221; in the Washington Post! </p>
<p>Go nuts, and if enough of you say the same thing she&rsquo;s either going to have to publish, to a great degree of ridicule, or she&rsquo;ll realise too late that treating White Nationalists like bacteria to be studied and neutralised has resulted in her academic career, and hence any future government diversity work, going down the pan.</p>

<p>What I think she wants is basic data, so that she and her profs can have a <i>quantitative</i> answer to the question: &#8220;What is a White Nationalist?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once they have that, they can ask and answer all kinds of questions without ever explicitly having asked them to White Nationalists. Some examples might be: what kind of economy could get young married White Nationalists who are married to become divorced? What kind of economic events could get them to engage in murder, suicide, or other activities destructive to both self and others at a higher rates than they do at present? Are there other events in their lives that can be cross-correlated to those phenomena so that those other types of events could be manipulated to bring about self- or other destructive activities? What kinds of cross-correlations of cross-correlations of cross-correlations etc. are valid to do?</p>
<p>These are the sorts of questions and answers one can do with any large table of linearized (or linearizable) data.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a more concrete example: suppose I want to know the density, melting point, boiling point, or other properties of a chemical compound for which there are no records because nobody has ever synthesized it. Can I do that? The answer is &#8216;yes&rsquo;, not only because I can find methods of estimating properties based on books like <a href="http://goo.gl/tToZS" rel="nofollow">The Properties of Liquids and Gases</a>, but because I can make my own plausible (even if somewhat kludge-like) models based upon pre-existing parts of already listed molecules in a book like the <a href="http://goo.gl/wmLwl" rel="nofollow">CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</a> and then stuff a large number of equations based on the presence or absence of those molecular parts into a heavily overdetermined <a href="http://goo.gl/GzPe" rel="nofollow">least squares</a> problem. I solve the overdetermined least squares problem A x = b for each property I want, and then do the dot product of my unknown compound&rsquo;s vector with the x relevant for each property. I will get an answer that is within a very few percentage points of the correct one, sometimes even less than one percent off. I have done this many times, both with absolute unknown molecules and with test molecules for which there was already good data but which I left out of my large overdetermined list of compounds.</p>
<p>The same sort of effort can be made with electrochemical half-reactions, heat of combustion equations, heat of formation equations, etc.</p>
<p>Provided you have a large enough data base, you can almost always get interesting answers to even the most arcane questions.</p>
<p>In addition, I am not limited to least squares as a modality. I can strike out in a mathematically different direction if I want something more affiliated with change over time, like <a href="http://goo.gl/ew2Zf" rel="nofollow">eigenvalues</a> or <a href="http://goo.gl/YGshN" rel="nofollow">singular value decomposition</a>.</p>
<p>Although <a href="http://goo.gl/U8so" rel="nofollow">factor analysis</a> is the thing people usually associate with sociology, if I&rsquo;m not so much interested in explanations but more in what I can do (what anti-white activism I can undertake), those other methods might very well be more applicable  </p>
<p>And that is why I linked to the NLS cautions against trying to download their database; I wanted people to understand how much data about the general populace has already been collected.</p>
<p>Personally, I am far less conversant with sociology than I am with harder sciences like chemistry or physics, but I see how much data they have collected over the years and it seems to me that the sky is the limit concerning what they can do with it. </p>
<p>And there is no way this young Harvard woman can give guarantees about how the data she collects will be used or about just who will use it for what. Even if she keeps her promises about the anonymity of the participants, the data can (and probably will) be used to abuse White Nationalists as a class (or, more properly, a sociological vector, as the case may be &hellip;).</p>
<p>And who maintains that vast NLS curated database? Why, the University of Chicago and affiliated research groups, of course. </p>
<p>University of Chicago? Chicago political machine? Saul Alinsky? Obama? Do you get it yet? Am I starting to ring any bells here?</p>
<p>As has often been said before, you are either pro-white or pro-white genocide; which one of those two do you think describes this young woman, the sociology department at Harvard, or the University of Chicago and its affiliated research groups?</p>

		<p>Ref. #126   This is very interesting. I agree with your reservations.  Eysenck&rsquo;s work in particular was always very heavily based on data gathering.  The huge pressure on campus nowadays is to treat that which is statistically rare in youth politics  as being clinically suspect.  </p>

		<p>Research interests like this way back when Marxism was taboo in<br>
America, hit a snag in efforts to study leftist radicals because so many of them were FBI plants.  At one time, it was estimated that the CPUSA could not remain solvent without the dues money of purported members who in fact were spies.  Relevant? </p>

		<p>REf. post 128  &mdash;  These are excellent observations/ information.  <br>
I&rsquo;m receptive to your views re &#8220;psychological profiling&#8221; done by<br>
such entities as the FBI Behavioral Sciences Section in Virginia  &mdash;  <br>
and the DoD and so on.  The government gives evidence of being far more interested in controlling and impeding than in understanding.</p>

		<p>Sooner or later in any relationship like this with a professed<br>
inquirer/interviewer, a warning sign is the feeling that your<br>
answers are being merely &#8220;flypapered&#8221;  &mdash;  that is, the merely short<br>
soliloquies are being levitated from you and that no communication<br>
&#8220;ping pong&#8221; is happening that reveals whether the interviewer/<br>
examiner has ears for what you are saying.  Again, a real sounding re her is what she had read and her own notes and questions about relevant books, journals, etc.  </p>

		<p>One problem is the categorical nature a term like &#8220;white nationalist movement&#8221;.  Most things exist in varied degrees. That she seems interested only in &#8220;activists&#8221; ( the movement ) is a<br>
warning sign.  Another is the extent to which people have varying points of demarcation in an &#8220;us/them&#8221; distinction: Some whites<br>
make a convincing case for judicious inter-mixtures with Northern Asians, for example.  Her motivations have a lot of question marks hanging over them.   </p>
