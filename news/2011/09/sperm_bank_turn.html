<h1><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/8768598/Sperm-bank-turns-down-redheads.html">Sperm Bank Turns Down Redheads</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Orange, Telegraph (London), September 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Ole Schou, Cryos&rsquo;s director, said that there had been a surge in donations in recent years, allowing the facility to become much more picky about its donors.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are too many redheads in relation to demand,&#8221; he told toldDanish newspaper Ekstrabladet. &#8220;I do not think you chose a redhead, unless the partner  &mdash;  for example, the sterile male  &mdash;  has red hair, or because the lone woman has a preference for redheads. And that&rsquo;s perhaps not so many, especially in the latter case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Schou said the only reliable demand for sperm from redheaded donors from Ireland, where he said it sold &#8220;like hot cakes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cryos&rsquo;s stores have now reached their peak capacity of 70 litres of semen, and Mr Schou has a waiting list of 600 donors.</p>
<p>He said sperm from donors with brown hair and brown eyes was particularly in demand, because of the bank&rsquo;s large customer base in Spain, Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>Indian sperm was also hard to find, he said, because India does not allow sperm or eggs to be exported, causing a problem for childless international Indians.</p>
<p>Cryos pays donors up to $500 (Â£316), and sends its semen to over 65 countries worldwide.</p>

		<p>According to <a>Science</a>, &#8220;A pigmentation gene from the bones of two Neandertals, reported online this week in <em>Science</em>, indicates that at least some Neandertals had pale skin and red hair, similar to some of the Homo sapiens who today inhabit their European homeland.&#8221;  Add this to the recent revelation that ancient humans in Europe and Asia practiced miscegenation with Neanderthals and it&rsquo;s easy to interpret as an especially ancient discrimination.  (Remember that &#8216;discrimination&rsquo; is a word with both positive and negative attributes - it&rsquo;s good to have discriminating tastes, everyone agrees.)</p>

		<p>I think we should start our own donor egg bank, and stock it with eggs from blonde-haired, blue-eyed Nordic types.  Not that I would wish to discriminate against Brown-haired, brown-eyed White women, but if our Blonde/Blue women are being driven to extinction, it seems the science is available to save that part of our gene pool. As it is, we already have a lebensborn program for African Blacks and Asians as we in the White world have adopted their unwanted children by the thousands.  Start an egg bank, find some financial donors who will support surrogate mothers, and then match White newborns with White families who agree to raise an extra child as their own. I am certain this could be done.</p>

		<p>Yeah why not a League of Red Headed Men? Or in Heinlein&rsquo;s Lazarus Long stories, some wealthy families started a private, very discrete Eugenic Society which enticed qualified people to join by offering them a large sum if they agreed to marry into certain families. Alas out economic Elite has chosen other things, like sterility and homosexuality instead.</p>

		<p>There used to be many, many more redheads,and not that long ago.  Harassment of redheads was a silly childhood thing when I was growing up, but its affect has been that redheads often hate themselves so much they mate with darker people.  But when Julius Cesear invaded Gaul, he wrote of the Celtic women many of whom were redheads and all of whom were of &#8220;exceeding beauty.&#8221;  Of course, this made them highly desirable as slaves, and the long decline of redheads and white beauty in general has been on the decline ever since.</p>

		<p>What was left out of the Amren article and also from the so-called &#8216;original article&rsquo; was the following paragraph (which was included in the Australian newspapers): &#8220;The Danes do not want any red-headed kids. Despite their reputation for tall blondes,  they&rsquo;d rather have small, dark children.&#8221;  Figure that one out! </p>

		<p>I wonder how truthful the people at Cryos are.  Lots of lefties probably accuse them of being neo-Nazis hawking Aryan sperm to make blond-haired, blue-eyed babies for people who are too racist and selfish to provide adoptive homes for the unwanted dark-skinned orphan multitudes.</p>
<p>One sperm bank that I looked at did not appear to have any sperm donors who were less than 5&rsquo;10 in height.  My guess is that the &#8220;Indian donors&#8221; are very light-skinned Indians, as I doubt that infertile Indian couples are willing to take a lower-caste, darker skinned donor&rsquo;s sperm.  </p>
<p>A lot of people purchasing sperm are looking for intelligence, athleticism and musical ability, but I&rsquo;m sure that for many, blond hair and blue eyes are the top priority.  I think the entire article ends up being an advertisement for Cryos.  &#8220;We have every kind of sperm you could want!&#8221;  It actually makes sense to me that only people who already had red hair in their family would want their child to have red hair.  Red hair always stands out, and people always ask about who else in the family has red hair, etc.  If you don&rsquo;t intend to be open about the use of donor sperm, you are going to prefer brown or blond hair to red, as they just are not as remarkable as red hair.</p>

		<p>I think some of you might take this a bit wrong.</p>
<p>Neither he nor his company discriminates against redheads, they merely stock that which sells.<br>
And redhead sperm does not sell all that well, except in Ireland, which one has to assume is a relatively small market after all, since they export to all of Europe.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t say they turn them down, only that they have more willing donors compared to the demand, which might just mean that there are more redheads in Denmark compared to the average in Europe (not very surprising).</p>
<p>All it really says is that most prefer children that looks like themselves, even if they have to get a sperm donor, something that shouldn&rsquo;t come as a great upset for anyone that has any clue about what most people actually want.</p>
<p><br>
Basically, the company does just the right and natural thing. They stock that which sells, and it is the law of supply and demand that is in effect, without anyone trying to impose any social engineering on it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Not accepting red-haired donors&#8221; is just rude! Fully half of my large, extended family are redheads, and I mean REAL redheads, not strawberry blondes or brown hair with warm highlights! Males and females, but  it seems more females than males. All colors of eyes on the redheads, blue, green, brown and all variations of  same. When a couple are expecting a child everyone takes bets on whether or not it will be a redhead. WE LOVE REDHEADS!!! (I am a red-haired female myself and so is my daughter.) </p>

<p>Do you ever read the egg donor ads in the college newspapers? </p>
<p>The egg banks claim they will pay up to $80,000 for eggs from a 5&rsquo;ft6 and up,blue eyed blonde or light brown haired donor with high SAT scores.  Of course, up to $80,000 can mean anything, like those sales persons ads that say can earn &#8220;up to&#8221; whatever.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for short,hispanic women to sell their eggs unless their SAT scores are very high.</p>
<p>The desireable tall blonde intelligent eggs can be obtained from eastern europe very cheaply.<br>

<p>They do, but they do not want children who obviously do not look like the natural children of the family.  Who wants constant questions about adoption or even worse people sneering at the Mother wondering who the real father of one of the kids is?</p>
<p>I read an article written by a black family that runs a foster home for smaller kids who hopefully will soon go back to their Mothers.  They always have a White toddler or 2.  People are always asking the Mother, what a beautiful baby.  He must look like his Father.  </p>
<p>Then the foster Mother had to go into a long explanation that she is a foster Mother.  Then she has to avoid questions about what&rsquo;s wrong with the real Mother that the child was taken away.</p>
<p>Now the foster Mother just says she is a baby sitter or the White baby is the child of a friend or neighbor.  Of coure the White toddlers often call her Mommy in public.  But it is a pain to be always getting stares and answering questions from strangers.<br>

<p>The Princesses in the old fairy stories often married poor but brave and intelligent warriors who the Kings made their heirs.<br>
Nowdays the elite Princesses refuse to have children on the grounds that White children pollute the earth.</p>

		<p>Imagine if you will, that the government had the same rules for sperm banks as they do for the general public.  That is; 1) each ethnic/race group&rsquo;s sperm is represented in direct proportion to that of the general population, and 2) no segregation or racial segregation allowed for the product.  That is, want a baby, you get what you get with no ethnic/racial assurances.  Luck of the draw.  Of course the sperm banks would be out of business immediately.  <br>
So if people are allowed to seek preferences in ethnicity/race of their third party babies, why not in their postpartum existence as well?</p>

		<p>To Number 16:  People are probably more willing to pay big bucks for eggs in the USA because they are more certain that they will get what they paid for.  Doing business with the Russians is always risky, and there is just no telling where the Russian sperm/egg banks are getting their goods. </p>
<p>If a man in a psych ward is willing to &#8220;donate&#8221; in exchange for a pack of cigarettes, the Russian sperm bank would be glad to turn around and charge you thousands of dollars for the same sperm by telling you that it is the sperm of a computer genius who plays the piano and who is 6&rsquo;2&#8221; with blond hair and blue eyes.  There is also no telling where they would get eggs, as I have heard that it is possible to mature and then fertilize the eggs of aborted fetuses.</p>

		<p>As a short dark-haired white male, with fair grandchildren, I was interested in comments also on English websites.  There was a quite a bit of typically ill-informed, knee-jerk rage against &#8220;eugenics&#8221;.  (Still, a defence of ginger-hair, characteristic almost exclusively of whites, is welcome.)  There is a liberal/christian prejudice against preferential reproduction of non-coloured, non-disabled, non-intelligent children; you often hear people objecting to voluntary eugenic conception (abortion is a separate issue) because parents might want and select (quote} &#8220;blond and blue-eyed&#8221; children - perish the thought! (&#8220;Hitler&rsquo;s Holocaust&#8221; propaganda is responsible for this.)<br>
The real problem seems to be that in world population terms, blue-eyed blonds could become an endangered species, the &#8220;passing of the great race&#8221; as it used to be called.<br>
Back in 1935 the then socialist Herman Muller proposed a sperm bank for healthy and productive citizens, an idea taken up by the anti-socialist Robert Klark Graham, author of &#8220;The Future of Man&#8221; (1970) to preserve and promote high IQ levels in later generations; theoretically it could be used to help preserve the hair, skin,eye color and skull shape of white race(s).  The same year the journalist Brian Connell wrote a fairly accurate prediction of our present dystopian condition (from overpopulation &c;) in &#8220;Britain in the Year 2000&#8221;. <br>
One of his preventive measures or remedial counter-proposals (p.113) reads: &#8220;There will still be a repugnance to the idea of a master race, in which only those of Anglo Saxon stock, or proven IQ, or proven financial means should breed, but the pressures of the old century, and the challenges of the new, will have already have forced these limitations on the nation.&#8221;<br>
Who are the masters now?<br>

		<p>i have begun studying molecular biology and i intend to open a private sperm and egg bank. i also want to open a private school and daycare center where children can thrive and learn and play. i believe it may be possible to transplant fetuses instead of abortion. unwanted children and orphans welcome to come and live. i would make sure it were totally safe and i will not hire people i suspect of being pedos. i am preparwd to kill every member of nambla if i have to.</p>

		<p>The uncomfortable truth is that all humans practice eugenics; some are just more interested in producing traits in their children associated with musical, or mathematical, or artistic / plastic arts ability. or other abilities characterized as intellectually desireable. Some unfortunates can only strive to produce better, smarter, more ruthless criminals because that is all that is &#8220;out there&#8221; in the breeding community. Evolution via natural selection doesn&rsquo;t apply to people since we  don&rsquo;t maximize our birth rate; rather, we optimize it as best we can envision what the optimal is. </p>

		<p>Red head discrimination could be an actual phenomenon. <a href="https://www.newsytype.com/11601-redhead-discrimination/" rel="nofollow">Danish sperm bank no longer takes donations from redheads</a> . Redheaded Donors were no longer accepted at the world&rsquo;s biggest sperm bank. It sounds ginger discrimination. However, when there is a low demand, the need to limit resources. To avoid over supply in the society. A good reason behind for doing so. </p>
