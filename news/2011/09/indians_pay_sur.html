			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dean Nelson, Telegraph (London), June 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Madhya Pradesh state government is investigating claims that up to 300 girls were surgically turned into boys in one city after their parents paid about Â£2,000 each for the operations.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s and children&rsquo;s rights campaigners denounced the practice as a &#8220;social madness&#8221; that made a &#8220;mockery of women in India&#8221;.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s gender balance has already been tilted in favour of boys by female foeticide  &mdash;  sex selection abortions  &mdash;  by families who fear the high marriage costs and dowries they may have to pay. There are now seven million more boys than girls aged under six in the country.</p>
<p>Campaigners said the use of surgery meant that girls were no longer safe even after birth.</p>
<p>The row emerged after newspapers disclosed children from throughout India were being operated on by doctors in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>Doctors confronted in the investigation claimed that girls with genital abnormalities were being sent to the city&rsquo;s clinics to be &#8220;surgically corrected&#8221; and that only children born with both male and female sexual characteristics were eligible for the procedure. But campaigners said the parents and doctors were misindentifying the children&rsquo;s conditions to turn girls into boys.</p>
<p>The surgery, known as genitoplasty, fashions a penis from female organs, with the child being injected with male hormones to create a boy.</p>
<p>Dr V P Goswami, the president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics in Indore, described the disclosures as shocking and warned parents that the procedure would leave their child impotent and infertile in adulthood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Genitoplasty is possible on a normal baby of both the sexes but later on these organs will not grow with the hormonal influence and this will lead to their infertility as well as their impotency. It is shocking news and we will be looking into it and taking corrective measures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Parents have to consider the social as well as the psychological impact of such procedures on the child.&#8221;</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights ordered the Madhya Pradesh government to investigate the claims and produce its findings within 15 days.</p>
<p>Ranjana Kumari, of the Centre for Social Research and one of India&rsquo;s leading campaigners against female foeticide, said the surgical transformation of girls into boys without their informed consent was a sign of India&rsquo;s growing &#8220;social madness&#8221;.</p>
<p>She said she despaired that education had failed to stop the growing rejection of baby girls in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;The figures are getting worse. In 2001 there were 886 girls born to every 1,000 boys in Delhi. Today there are only 866. The more educated and rich you are, the more there is killing of girls,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&rsquo;t want to share their property or invest in girls&rsquo; education or pay dowries. It&rsquo;s the greedy middle classes running after money. It is just so shocking and an outright violation of children&rsquo;s rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government needed to address the problem by stressing the spiritual value a girl or woman brought a household in Hindu culture. &#8220;In India we say God resides in that house where there&rsquo;s a woman but that has evaporated because of all this greed. We need to emphasise the spiritual wealth a girl brings to a family, but we also need to support them with financial subsidies and jobs,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t even work.  Gender identity is determined by hormones acting on the brain during fetal development.  Those are going to be badly mixed up &#8220;boys&#8221;.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the book, &#8220;As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl&#8221; by John Colapinto.  That book describes the opposite transformation   &mdash;   due to a botched circumcision the decision was made to turn a baby boy into a &#8220;girl&#8221;.  The &#8220;girl&#8221; was raised as such but led a very conflicted life, always wanting to do the boys&rsquo; things and not the girls things.  The man/woman&rsquo;s life ended tragically.  The book is important for demonstrating how pernicious is the modern feminist doctrine that men and women differ merely by plumbing, with all the observed differences in personality and behavior the result of evil patriarchal conditioning.<br>

<p>This is like in China where they now have a preponderance of boys as compared to girls. And will be big problems in the future. All those boys when grown will not have mates to marry and make them civil and homebodies! Such statistics bode evil for the future. </p>
<p>And those girls made boys will need shots the rest of their lives. And as for the privates from a female made into a male, well, I just wonder.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t mess with mother nature. Mother can bite and hard.</p>

		<p>That works out perfect. More Indians that are infertile in the future equals less ridiculous India customs such as this. India boys who can&rsquo;t reproduce will solve alot of problems. Good for them.</p>

		<p>Not to be nit-picky, but this story should be filed under India/Pakistan, rather than under Indians, which I assume to mean American Indians, not East Indians. The fact that the two races share the same name is purely an accident of history, and rather illogical, I must say.</p>

		<p>There is also a saying in the Hindu scriptures that says something to the effect: &#8220;Let there be no woman born into this house.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Feminists and advocates for trans-sexuals who claim that gender is cultural and not biological have no argument against this practice, none at all.  Only all of science and human history plus a bit of common sense has an argument against this practice.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for adults making adult choices.  I don&rsquo;t care if a woman dresses up like a man and has sex with women.  I don&rsquo;t care if a white person paints his or her face with burnt cork and talks like a 19th Century Southerner.  Pretend time is fun time.  But mutilation of children is not acceptable.</p>

		<p>More than two decades ago, reports from India were that a rural folk method of filtering semen had been used successfully in animal<br>
husbandry there over time to produce consistently in various settings a gender selection efficacy of about 90% or more.   It was convincingly alleged that the same filtering would produce with humans likewise about an 90% chance of gender selection in semen so filtered and then AI&rsquo;d into a woman.  I never followed up the commercially-inspired  efforts at applying this eventually to humans in the US   &mdash;  centered in Nebraska, if if I recall correctly?  &mdash;  and clearly if such a &#8220;technology&#8221; had cleared the runway, we&rsquo;d certainly have heard of it by now.  </p>

		<p>If both China and India have a preponderance of boys in the millions, and are continuing with their anti-female policy, then that does not bode well for our countries.That they can&rsquo;t find a wife is sure to lead to discontent, and anger. If they go into the army, and are trained to fight, at some time in the future, they will want to. The other option that has been mentioned, and is the most probable, is migration to any &#8220;white&#8221; country, and endeavour to marry white girls there/here. </p>
<p>Under the current &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; immigration policies and because of the cry for foreign workers from large corporations (I am writing from Australia), that is, unfortunately, the most likely scenario. My congratulations that you are still continuing to state and defend your position as both rational and moral. <br>

		<p>This is what happens when sophisticated Western medical techniques are misused in a totally alien landscape.  The fact that this surgery is even available is a near miracle which was probably pioneered by, let me guess: evil white men - to be used in sensitive cases to relieve patients who are psychologically convinced they are of the opposite sex or infants born with ambiguous genitalia.  Either way, it should not be available in India or China.  No matter how sophisticated these cultures are reported to be toward their elderly populations, seemingly even more believe magic &#8220;doctors&#8221; can stitch a penis onto a girl child and with a few injections, she will be a he.  And all for the price of $2,000?  Why am I not surprised about this story?</p>

		<p>I have friends who gush about how spiritual the people from India are, because they buy into this image of them forced on us by the lying media. No matter what agenda the media pushes, India is a third world country, so reading that this is happening there comes as no shock. It&rsquo;s in keeping with the mentality. They may have the money to afford the surgery, but their so called medical professionals do not have an ounce of ethics. This is so wrong on so many levels. Even India&rsquo;s doctors behave like third world ignorant people.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always marveled at the Asian desperation to have sons. Of course, in medieval times (which was only 50 years ago for them) it was better to have a son than a daughter because the son could work the farm and take care of them. But today? When there is a shortage of women? Just think   &mdash;   with so few women a daughter could land nearly any rich bachelor she likes. I suspect that within a generation women will be valued very highly indeed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the economics of supply and demand which one takes for granted doesn&rsquo;t work in India.</p>
<p>For example, the supply of brides in the rural state of Punjab is so bad that brothers are forced to marry the same woman (that&rsquo;s right, polyandry). Or get women from other communities from out of state. So one would think that daughters would be sought after by parents, right?</p>
<p>Wrong! Instead, female foeticide has risen to alarming levels in that state in recent times. It takes a certain amount of intelligence to put 2 and 2 together, which unfortunately those people lack. Free market economics don&rsquo;t work there.<br>

		<p>The truth is there is NO non-white country or culture in the world that treats women equally or fairly or holds females to be as desirable or worthful as males. White females in the west may complain of gender inequality and discrimination, but compared to non-western societies they haven&rsquo;t seen anything yet. I would argue that white feminists should be the strongest opponents to non-white immigration since the arrival of these peoples and the mentality / culture they espouse is a great threat to feminism and its successes.</p>

		<p>&#8220;That they can&rsquo;t find a wife is sure to lead to discontent, and anger.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Aussie: These various historians seem to suggest that this sort of thing has occurred in the past. Similar situations have existed during the very long history of Chinese civilization and coincide with upheaval, violent revolution, massive rebellion and just a total breakdown of society.</p>
<p>This British Admiral Parry who predicted the world order as we know it will begin to break down in a number of years, less than a decade, used overlays on the world map to determine those areas most susceptible to breakdown. One overlay I believe consisted of those nations where the ratio of young men to young women was drastically skewed in favor of the young men. A society where the number of young men without eligible mates is drastic makes for a bad situation.</p>

As for evil &#8220;white&#8221; men ALWAYS being used when describing those who probably pioneered this procedure or any other evil thing I have a problem with. Let us begin to classify such people as to who they are. Not that catch-all phrase &#8220;White&#8221;. That could mean many people who are not by definition of the White race. This offends me to no end. Especially on sites such as Amren. We should all know better.</p>

<p>Exactly.  Women are more priviledged, more powerful and protected here than anywhere else.   But the fact that our  disgruntled feminists  and man-haters are blind to that glaring fact proves that they are merely &#8220;Useful Idiots&#8221;  who have been recruited into the service of the campaign to destoy all white culture and white people (ultimately including them).</p>
<p>In their  raging anger against society and against Nature which made them women,  they are setting afire the ship they are sailing on.</p>
<p>I could say the same thing about the organized gay movement (not about gays per se   &mdash;    just as I am not criticizing  all women per se).</p>
<p>All these movements  (even the mainstream churches) have been infiltrated and taken over by the Frankfurt School and the  Marxist  &#8220;March on the Institutions&#8221;,  lead and directed by a hostile elite who are determined to abolish us.</p>
<p>Does this sound paranoid?  Yes it does.<br>
But is it true?  Well, just look around.</p>

		<p>Microsort (google it) has been available for a number of years.  It gives you a very good chance of sorting your sperm into X only or Y only.  There is also PGD, which does genetic testing of embryos, allowing the girl embryos to be separated from the boy embryos.  Finally, there is a new blood test available in Europe, and no doubt soon to be available world wide that can tell you when you are 7 weeks pregnant whether the baby will be a boy (98% accurate) or a girl (95% accurate.)</p>
<p>I am personally opposed to abortion, but since people in India don&rsquo;t seem to have a problem with abortion, WHY would they resort to sex-change operations on healthy girls?  Disgusting.  </p>
<p>Sureesh:  This story is one of the reasons that Americans don&rsquo;t want Asians moving here, whether they are smart or dumb.  Ick!</p>

		<p>#22:  The problem with that thinking is to admit that God has made sex and even species assignment mistakes, that we have to live with regardless of the technology we have, that was developed by our supposedly God-designed brain.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t that they &#8220;think&#8221; they are something else.  They BELIEVE they were supposed to be something else.  As a Christian, I&rsquo;m sure you can understand the concept of strong belief?  Think of them as putting their money where their beliefs are - such operations are expensive, require lots of treatments over a long time (lifetime of hormone shots?) and one must be REALLY dedicated to his belief to go through with something like that!</p>
<p>Really, it harms no one else, especially if the person just wants to live the rest of their life as who they are without broadcasting that they changed.</p>
<p>I can respect that.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t like gender-changers, what on Earth do you make of poor souls like Tigerman?  He so strongly believed that your God assigned him to the wrong SPECIES, he underwent years of expensive surgery and prosthetic implants.  What does he do for a living?  I dunno, maybe he charges people to look at him; but I do think that it&rsquo;s sad that some Muslim or Sikh who is uglier and scarier looking than him would be more likely to be hired to do .. anything.</p>
<p>To be honest, the way I feel about humanity and my dislike of being in the same species as, say, Muslims and Sikhs makes me sick enough to empathize strongly with Tigerman, but his efforts, imo, are half-arsed.  For me, it would be gene therapy or nothing.  The way my life has gone, I might as well be a hairy lupine monster (albeit a short one) living in the deepest, darkest Boreal forest in the Territories, and woe betide any human who came into my neck of the woods.</p>
<p>When it comes to strong beliefs, baby, you Christians have nothing on people with ID complexes.</p>

		<p>Spirit Wolf:  In the UK, a man got the NHS to turn him into a woman at taxpayer expense, then decided he had made a mistake, and the NHS turned him back into a man at taxpayer expense.  And this was while elderly people were left in extreme pain and discomfort waiting for the NHS to provide them with a knee or hip transplant.</p>
<p>It is one thing if people can afford this elective surgery without assistance, and something else if everybody in the country, or everyone paying for insurance has to pay extra or accept reduced benefits in order to make these very expensive elective procedures possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;In India, sanity exists only in the 4 southernmost states. They consider North Indians to be quite ostentatious, irrational and dirty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believe Madhya Pradesh is considered Central India and thanks for a good ole North India bashing, which was, considering the topic, completely irrelevant. I suspect you&rsquo;re one of the Sureesh/Venkatershwara Balarupattam variety from one of the &#8220;sane&#8221; southern states who&rsquo;s sitting in the USA on a visa, with an incomprehensible patois, a totally fake resume, and pretending to be a baby-genius at Java and data structures. I&rsquo;ve seen how women are treated in the South of India, and also how perverted and disgusting your men are. And every bit as ostentatious and flaunting their ill-begotten wealth, all transferred by the &#8220;outsourcing&#8221; of jobs grabbed from the Americans. At least the North Indians know how to celebrate in style, and have been doing so for centuries. I&rsquo;ve seen you guys &#8220;hard&#8221; at work, picking some poor harassed white guy&rsquo;s brains, doing a knowledge transfer, and likely the poor guy gets fired while you revel in his misfortune.</p>
<p>What you folks don&rsquo;t see here are the &#8220;irrational&#8221; northern Indians, many of whom are, at the very least, part white. They have the good sense to stay home and work in agriculture, and other irrational pursuits. Quite unlike the self proclaimed geniuses from South India who luuuve to immigrate en masse to the US of A.</p>
<p>@ Poster 20 - you&rsquo;re right. I find it incredible that Western women don&rsquo;t appreciate the society that gives them the freedom to live their lives as they please. I feel sad for white men, who are so maligned everywhere, including by their own women. This is wrong on so many levels, especially because they are, by and large, the most honorable group of men I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. </p>

		<p>I live in the city of Indore where these cases are supposed to have happened.  The local Hindi language newspapers have investigated all this and it has been found to be a complete lie.  I have read many reports in Hindi newspapers about this case but never read a name V.P. Goswami.  In fact gender imbalance is a problem largely limited to north India not central India (madhya pradesh).  English language media should expose the many social ills and customs of Indian society but it should be based on facts not lies.  The people on this forum should be wary when media reports such outrageous stories.    </p>

		<p>Speaking of India, here&rsquo;s something strange - The two most recent articles from the AP I have read about the financial and business troubles of Bank of America have both been dateline Bangalore.  Why are stories about Bank of *America* coming out of Bangalore?</p>
