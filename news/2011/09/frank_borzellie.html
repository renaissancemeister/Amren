<h1>Frank Borzellieri to Speak to Maryland C of CC</h1>

	<p>10/9/2011 EVENT.  Mr. Frank Borzellieri, a onetime forthright speaker and writer on racial and multicultural issues, and defender of Western civilization, speaker at several American Renaissance conferences, and author of several engaging books, was <a href="/news/2011/08/cowards_in_the.html">recently fired</a> as principal of a Catholic school in New York City only because he held certain views and had the courage to express them. His record as a teacher and principal had been exemplary. Prior to his career in education, Mr. Borzellieri had been a controversial newspaper columnist and member of a local board of education. This firing has seriously impacted his ability to earn a living and obtain affordable health insurance. Mr. Borzelleiri will fully describe this shocking experience and his storied career.<br>

		<p>Kevin MacDonald has gone on about previous Jewish encouragement of immigration but what about the RC Church need for Mexicans, Africans and others to fill its otherwise emptying post-Vatican 2 pews?  It is no asset having millions of Muslims, Hindus and Animists settling in former Christendom.</p>

		<p>If Frank Borzellieri was openly encouraging his Hispanic students to be highly racialized in their politics, if he demonized Native Born White Americans in his class lectures and if he exclaimed in his class how wonderful it would be if Native Born White Americans are reduced to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of American&hellip;well, I&rsquo;ll state the obvious:  He would still have his job.</p>
<p>If the cost of Hispanic immigration was passed to the Catholic priests, they would have to go out and wash dishes to keep their bachelor pads at the rectory&hellip;this, of course, would put them in direct competition with the Mexicans&hellip;this would put a rapid end to their enthusiasm for Hispanic immigration.</p>

		<p>Somehow, there needs to be fund developed among European-Americans to care for their brethren who are victimized like Frank in the current anti white pogrom. We need something like the old immigrant aid societies of the 19th century. Where are our George Soroses who can underwrite such a fund?</p>

		<p>I worked for several years in financial positions for the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, a majority-Mexican diocese.  Although they are the minority, the English-speaking Americans contribute the lion&rsquo;s share of the funds, while the Mexican schools and parishes are constantly running out of money and having to be subsidized.  Furthermore, the archdiocese prefers to have the Mexican parishes and schools staffed by Mexican priests and laypeople.  So the idea that Mexican (and other Hispanic) immigration is a financial or employment windfall for American clergy as one commenter claims is wrong.  It&rsquo;s actually a burden on the Church.  It&rsquo;s supported by the clergy purely out of knee-jerk holier-than-though white guild and left liberalism.</p>

		<p>I agree with the writer who said that there should be some kind of fund for our brethren like Frank Borzellieri who have their livelihoods destroyed by these politically correct cowards like th Archdiocese of New York. This C of CC event is a fundraiser for Frank who no longer has his job or health insurance, per a previous AR article. If you cannot attend, is there a place we can send a contribution for Frank?</p>

I&rsquo;d say the jew-bashing is also a big turnoff to people when they hear pro-white views.  They associate jew discussions with Hitler and Nazis and Al Queda, etc.  We need to focus on saying, &#8220;Other races look out for their own, why not whites?&#8221;  Point out the double standards of how it&rsquo;s considered racist for whites to group together for small government or white interests, while not saying a word about the numerous black, hispanic, asian, muslim advocacy groups out there.  Please stay off the &#8216;jew&rsquo; bashing.  It really turns people off!  There are jews who are conservative and hate what&rsquo;s going onto the West. </p>
<p>But back to the point, yes, I see lots of Protestant and Catholics pandering to Hispanics and blacks.  The older whites don&rsquo;t care for it, but the under 50 ones for sure are eating it up and are full of white guilt.   </p>

		<p>It is a sad comment that Catholics have become such a destructive force in our society.  First, the other Christian orders are not far behind, if at all.  With that said, I can vouch first hand for Mr. Borzellieri&rsquo;s experience.  I have become a pariah among my Catholic associates including friends and even other Boy Scout Leaders in our church troop.  It seems everyone is fashionably politically correct.  After trying to express my concern about our changing culture, it seems I am too old to understand the new world order. The world that I was born into was crime free, Christian, and 95% white.  There was almost no welfare programs and no need for any. America was sure of the future and the path to get there and Catholics were highly patriotic, good citizens.</p>
<p>Money collected from Catholics now goes to just more than supporting migrant workers and soup kitchens.  Communist Catholic organizations such as Pax Christi work overtime to deconstruct America.  Groups like Catholic Charities acting as federal government agents search far and wide for African muslims to come here to America as permanent residents.  Catholic Universities cover up images of Christ so that a muslim, foreign-born president is not seen as being partial to the West.  And do we need to get into the hundreds of millions of dollars still owed to the abused by homosexual priests. I no longer recognize my church and worse, those who still sit in the pews. It&rsquo;s as if evil itself has found the perfect way to destroy all that was good and decent.  So yes, I under stand how you feel Mr. Borzellieri. </p>

		<p>  The ignorance on this board surrounding the Catholic faith, and in general the anti Catholicism is palpable. To say that the Catholic Church is anathema to Western Civilization is downright laughable considering the almost unescapable reality that the Catholic Church shaped, if not guided Western Civilization and has been, if anything, a positive force.</p>
<p>  Protestant denominations are the ones who generally favor divorce, abortion, gay marriage, political correctness, interracial marriage,a moral system in which there are no spiritual repercussions for sin, ect. </p>
<p>  This is just downright bigotry against Church and should be seen as such.</p>

<p>Can you say that with a straight face after Vatican 11? The Catholic Church is a shell of what it used to be. Same with the Protestant ones also. The Catholic Church does not condemn interracial couplings as long as they join the Church. Why are there so many gay Priests, btw?</p>

		<p>10:  In all fairness, this debate isn&rsquo;t about various moral and social issues, it&rsquo;s about race and multiracialism.</p>
<p>But in deference to you, it&rsquo;s not just Catholics who are multiracialists.  You&rsquo;ll sooner find a tooth on a hen then you will a genuinely white nationalist Christian denomination.  They&rsquo;re all into the multiracialism   &mdash;   The Lutherans (I was baptized Missouri Synod but never confirmed) are really big time into it, especially the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; ELCA but even the supposedly &#8220;conservative&#8221; Wisconsin and Missouri Synods.  Low Protestants love African charity fundraising.  The UCC, (American conglomeration of formerly German-American formerly Calvinist denominations)   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re in a world by themselves.</p>

		<p>I wrote comment #9. I just want #10 to understand I am a Catholic and have all but been driven out of my church by progressives and the so-called social conscious crowd.  I said the other Christian denominations are not far behind in such claptrap and in many situations are united with Catholics and other religions in fostering an agenda.  While Catholics were 100% united against such issues as abortion, gay marriage etc., no longer is that a truism.  Prior to the last presidential campaign, I begged our Bishop to release a pastoral letter to make sure that the flock knew Obama was a strident supporter of abortion.  Eventually the Bishop did write a letter, one reminding everyone of the Obama health insurance plan for the poor.  After so many instances of such behavior, is there no wonder that I am critical of my religion in the hopes of saving it from itself?  And I will say it is unfair to blame Amren, one of the few outlets left in our great country where we can discuss these issues.  Frankly, I have not seen any comments that read anti-Catholic.  And it is true that many Catholic organizations are leftist with designs to &#8220;transform&#8221; our society.  Yes it was the Catholic Church that shaped Western civilization but that alone does not mean that it can&rsquo;t also have a hand in deconstructing it as well.  In any case we all will lose 2000 years of outstanding progress and instead will harken back to some evil, primitive time in human history.    </p>

		<p>To the Moderator: Thank you for letting us know that you&rsquo;ve rejected &#8220;numerous vicious and blatantly bigoted anti-Catholic posts.&#8221; As a Catholic who has returned to the Church in midlife, I am appreciative.</p>
<p>To &#8220;Anon 11:47,&#8221; I feel your pain. The problem is that after Vatican II (which was to bring renewal), the Church experienced an onslaught of radicalism that few know about. Even many Catholics are ignorant of the systematic attacks that occurred toward the liturgy, religious communities, schools, and colleges. Today we have Catholic high schools actively promoting the homosexual lifestyle and sex outside of marriage. Although many Catholics oppose illegal immigration, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops promote it.</p>
<p>Mr. Frank Borzellieri is one of the many sane voices who was ousted by a politically-correct Catholic hierarchy. A young friend of mine, who is staunchly traditionally Catholic, was fired from his job at a Catholic high school where an openly gay teacher was in a position of authority. This isn&rsquo;t unusual. Another young Catholic woman who graduated a year ago with a double major was asked point-blank during an interview for a job about her prayer life   &mdash;   because those who pray the Rosary are obviously seen as a threat and &#8220;anti-progressive.&#8221; When she admitted to attending the Latin Mass, the interviewer looked at her with shock and said, &#8220;We&rsquo;d prefer you didn&rsquo;t mention this to students.&#8221; Not surprisingly, she didn&rsquo;t get the job (which was at a Catholic high school).</p>
<p>There is a battle within the Catholic Church and all other churches. On one side, you have the traditional faithful who uphold the Bible&rsquo;s authority. On the other side, you have a progressive, anti-Christian group who is trying to destroy all tradition as it ushers in liberalism and even Marxism.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to Mr. Frank Borzellieri. He sounds like a good man who was targeted by the PC crowd because he refused to bow to their god of &#8220;diversity.&#8221; And racial consciousness is fine for everyone else except the white person.</p>
<p>There is some good news. More and more of the young men who are answering the call to priesthood are much more conservative than the two previous generations. This is quite a delightful development for Catholics who have been wearied by 40 years of craziness. The younger generation has more in common with the eighty-year old priests than the sixty-year old. And they&rsquo;re making no bones about loving Catholicism in all her rich traditions, including fidelity to the Pope and the Magisterium.</p>
<p>So for those who doubt Catholics, be aware - there are many of us who are just as outraged about this story as any good AmRen non-Catholic is. Change is coming but it is very, very slow. Such is the way with Rome.</p>

<p>First off, I do not see the Catholic &#8220;bashing&#8221; that poster #10 has accused us all of. From what I see there are opinions and nothing that is out of line. This story IS about what they did to Frank, so we replied about what has happened to the Catholic Church. We see plenty of Protestant &#8220;bashing&#8221; if you want to call it that, also. I don&rsquo;t call it bashing in the first place. I call it free speech, something we now see so little of, without being accused of being vicious and bigoted. Isn&rsquo;t this what the PC left does to us? We have so few places left to go to voice our opinions without being labeled, so I pray Amren doesn&rsquo;t fall into that trap.</p>
<p>I am  glad that you and OTHERS here pointed out that it was Vatican 11 that the Church began it&rsquo;s slide downhill to what it has become today. The same with the PC Protestant churches. It is like Satan and his minions (on earth) have infiltrated BOTH denominations. Even the Mormon church is not what it used to be. They have also become very PC.</p>
<p> I am a Protestant but not the kind we see so much of today. I do not attend church as I have found none that is biblically correct. They are all into multiculturalism and inclusion, tolerance, etc. something that is just the opposite of what my Bible has commanded of us.  I have spoken of this many times here on Amren and I do not feel that it is bashing, it is telling some truths. What do we have left if not having the right to voice our concerns withoout &#8220;offending&#8221; someone. I have come to hate that word, offend, as the marxists use it against us all the time to get what they want. Much like they use the word, racist. We cannot fall into that mindset. </p>

		<p>I love Frank B, been following him for almost 2 decades.  I would love to send him a few dollars even though I&rsquo;m out of work too.  I&rsquo;m starting to feel angry that the envelope I put into the local Catholic church basket is not used to help its own people like Frank but instead is given to some over-used super-uterus breeding thugs that will some day slash my progeny with machetes.  I&rsquo;d be better off giving that money to Frank.  I&rsquo;ve been a faithful Catholic for a very long time but I&rsquo;m getting tired of their silence on this issue.  Last week the priest&rsquo;s homily was that Jesus did not submit to appeals and it was not the church&rsquo;s intention to win popularity contests.  I was reminded of Pope JPII kissing the Koran - clearly breaking a commandment in my eyes - and I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking how full of it they all are sometimes.  People who cannot hear a word of criticism against the church aren&rsquo;t helping it.  At the end of the day I support the church because I believe it is what stands for Christendom and is the unbroken line extending back to Jesus Christ.  Is the CC perfect?. Not by a long shot.  But we are human, not divine.  </p>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t there some address for Frank Borzellieri on here?  I&rsquo;m going to search but if anyone posts it that would be good too.  All the best to everyone who reads this site and supports these viewpoints.</p>

		<p> I have posted on the courageous acts of College age men who stand fast and pray the Rosary as Our Lady directed, in public, for reparations for the gross sins of this Nation, and all others, against GOD. </p>
<p>I have directed people to web sites that I became familiar with, when I was forwarded this information by friends. It made for uplifting, and interesting reading. </p>
<p>Aside from what many here have heard, been told, or just believe out of some notion that comes to them, most Catholics are moderate, to staunchly Conservative, in fiscal and social matters. Most oppose Same Sex Marriage, and the removal of the &#8220;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&#8221; policy in the Military.</p>
<p>A former US Marine, Colonel John W. Ripley, a Navy Cross recipient, and traditional Conservative Catholic, testified before Congress about how Homosexuality, if allowed openly, would ruin the morale and readiness of the Services. </p>
<p>Of course, no one in Congress, which never served a day in Uniform, listened to him.</p>
<p>You can read the biography of this remarkable Marine in the book called, &#8220;An American Knight: The Life of of Colonel John W. Ripley, USMC&#8221; which is available at America Needs Fatima.org for $8.95. </p>
<p>I also encourage you to visit CatholicVote.org, and Tradition, Family and Property.org which sponsors two Camps for Catholic boys and their fathers, to attend together called, &#8220;Call to Chivaly&#8221; Camps. Here, boys learn how to become real men, and defend their Faith of Our Lord, Jesus Christ. <br>

		<p>The Catholic church&rsquo;s biggest theological seminar just happens to be in Nigeria. It&rsquo;s difficult to see how an organisation so hellbent on universalism, with its vast majority of followers drawn from Africa and Latin America, can be of any advantage for White europeans</p>

		<p>Deirdre #15: You must be aware of the Communist intention of their long march through all the Institutions of Western Society, to infiltrate, and destroy from within, the very things that make Western culture what it is.</p>
<p>They intended, and did, have Agents join the various Seminaries and Religious Schools, Groups, and Orders, to spread their Egalitarian Doctrine through the different Christian  Denominations, in order to destroy them.</p>
<p>Christianity, in any Denomination, is the Arch Enemy of Atheist Communism, whose chief Author, Marx, was also a Satanist. You can read more about that in a book available through World Net Daily.com. </p>
<p>I also recommend the book, &#8220;Revolution and Counter-Revolution&#8221;, which is available at www.anf.org .  </p>
