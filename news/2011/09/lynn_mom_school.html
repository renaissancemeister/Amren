<h1><a href="https://www.itemlive.com/articles/2011/09/02/news/news01.txt">Lynn Mom: School Rule Hurts Whites</a></h1>
 

<p>ItemLive, September 2, 2011</p>

</div> 



<p>A Lynn mother has started a petition drive to overturn a controversial public school policy that she maintains gives preference to non-whites when a student is trying to switch schools.</p>
<p>Patricia O&rsquo;Malley, who is white, believes her daughter was a victim of reverse discrimination when her attempt to transfer from Marshall Middle School to Pickering Middle School was denied.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s just not right that you can base this solely on race,&#8221; O&rsquo;Malley said during an interview at her home this week.</p>
<p>The policy in question is Lynn&rsquo;s Public Schools Voluntary Plan for School Improvement and the Elimination of Minority Isolation approved by the Lynn School Committee and the Massachusetts State Board of Education in February 1988.</p>
<p>According to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts general law chapter 71, section 37D, &#8220;racial isolation&#8221; occurs when more than 30 percent of the students are non-white.</p>
<p>So preference is given to minorities trying to switch schools under the policy.</p>
<p>But the Department of Education website states just 24.5 percent of the students in the Lynn school system are white, as opposed to 49.4 percent Latinos and 12.4 percent blacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is not racial isolation, I don&rsquo;t know what is,&#8221; O&rsquo;Malley said. &#8220;The system is no longer working and needs to be fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>School committee member Rick Starbard said he too thinks the policy should be changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds ridiculous (that) even though white children are a minority they are still viewed as a majority,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Malley learned about the policy when she wanted to get her soon-to-be sixth-grade daughter transferred out of Marshall Middle School, which is the closest middle school to her home.</p>
<p>She said Marshall students perform poorly on standardized tests and she doesn&rsquo;t the school has a safe environment for her daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am petrified of what will happen is she goes to Marshall,&#8221; O&rsquo;Malley said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>School committee member Donna Coppola agrees with the current policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the policy in Lynn is a good one. It allows every single child to go to their neighborhood school,&#8221; Coppola said. &#8220;If a child doesn&rsquo;t want to go to their neighborhood school, it can it make it more unbalanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coppola is suspicious when people want to change schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am always concerned when a parent doesn&rsquo;t want to go to a school. Do they just want to go to a white school or is it something else?&#8221; Coppola said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While O&rsquo;Malley and Walker have received positive praise about the petition, they are finding it difficult to persuade people to sign it. Twenty-three people have signed so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people are afraid that they will come off as racist,&#8221; Walker said.</p>
<p>The two have even been accused of being racist themselves.</p>
<p>When Walker posted the petition&rsquo;s link on her Facebook page, a few of her friends fired back.</p>
<p>&#8220;One friend told me just because you are in the minority doesn&rsquo;t make you a minority,&#8221; Walker said. &#8220;People think we want special treatment because we are white. That is not the case. We just want the same opportunities as everyone else.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario, her daughter will only attend Marshall for one year and O&rsquo;Malley said she will move if she had to.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to move, but I will,&#8221; O&rsquo;Malley said.</p>
