			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Vivian Ho, San Francisco Chronicle, September 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A bill loaded with immigration politics and potential implications for highway safety has landed on Gov. Jerry Brown&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>The legislation by Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, D-Los Angeles, would change police procedures at drunken-driving checkpoints, prohibiting officers from arresting drivers and immediately impounding their cars if their only offense is not having a license.</p>
<p>Supporters say the bill, AB353, would impose a consistent policy statewide  &mdash;  some agencies confiscate unlicensed drivers&rsquo; cars now, and some do not  &mdash;  while keeping DUI checkpoints from being turned into traps for otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants who cannot obtain licenses.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for families who have lost loved ones because of unlicensed drivers, the bill would endanger everyone who uses the roads.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Brown signs Cedillo&rsquo;s bill, &#8220;more people will die, plain and simple,&#8221; said Don Rosenberg, 58, who lives in Westlake Village (Los Angeles County).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re not condoning driving without a license,&#8221; said Dan Savage, Cedillo&rsquo;s chief of staff. &#8220;But we have to abide by the law, which is the law preventing illegal search and seizures.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Cedillo&rsquo;s bill becomes law, Rosenberg said, &#8220;not only will people who were caught get their cars back sooner, it will empower other people who haven&rsquo;t been driving because they were afraid of getting caught to start driving.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>One of my  immigration eureka moments was at the DMV. The guy in front of me had no social security card, no license, or ID of any kind. They gave him a form to fill out and sign and moved him onto the photo line. Me?!? I had the old license, but since I didn`t have my Social Security card with me I was told to go home and get it before they would renew my license&hellip;<br>
I said, &#8220;Wait a minute!!&#8221; The guy in front of me only had to sign a form!!! You HAVE my license on file, You HAVE my social security numnber on file, just put the number off your records on the darn form!! How comne he gets to go forward with nothing and I have to go home to prove something I already did LAST time?!?!&rsquo; The Highway Patrolman moving from around the counter with a stern look on his face was answer enough. Took an extra two hours out of my day&hellip; When I read Sam Francis`s definition of Anarco-Terror, letting one slide and sticking the next guy with the letter of the law I said, &#8220;That`s me!! That`s the DMV!&#8221;</p>

		<p>This Gil needs a wake up call. The next time somone without a license is passed through one of these checkpoints and later kills someone in an auto accident, SUE Gil in civil court for everything he has and then some. Gil is helping to establish a climate that led to a crime being committed.</p>

		<p>Cedillo, like all of the other Mexicans in Sacramental,has an allegiance to only one thing, La Raza, the Master Race of Me-hico.His real wish is for anyone who is not Mexican to die, disappear, or move to another place.They will,in the end, get their wish.After they do, they will try to flee to Whiter pastures,wherever that may be.</p>

		<p>Who&rsquo;s surprised by this, not any of us I&rsquo;m sure. We are now witnessing California become Mexico. How long have us vile, evil racists been warning that this would happen. Once they become a majority, they vote out the last White useful idiots and elect their own and enact their own laws. Why the liberals don&rsquo;t understand that is beyond me! Hows that saying go - &#8220;Where theres a Mexican, there is Mexico!&#8221;<br>
So now, Calif. will &#8220;unofficially&#8221; be part of Mexico but the rest of us ( Whites ) in the other 49 will be on the hook to support them. California will become the first state that will be funded TOTALLY by welfare. Just like the rest of Illinois is forced to support Chicago, the 49 will be forced to support California then Arizona then New Mexico then Nevada then  &mdash;    &mdash;  - ! </p>

		<p>The most ridiculous part of this story is &#8220;law-abiding illegal immigrant&#8221;. There is no such thing. They have deliberately, knowingly commited a federal crime. Driving is not a human rights issue, driving is a privilege that is earned by passing the requirements and obeying laws. Failure to do so means the loss of this privilege. Illegal aliens all must feel that laws don&rsquo;t apply to them and pandering politicians support them.</p>

		<p><i>law-abiding illegal immigrants</i></p>
<p>Orwell&rsquo;s Newspeak!  It seems to be used everywhere these days to justify ignoring the rule of law   &mdash;   well, what&rsquo;s left of it that is.</p>
<p><i>If Brown signs Cedillo&rsquo;s bill,  &#8216;more people will die, plain and simple,&rsquo; said Don Rosenberg.</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised the SF News Barnacle deigned to print this comment. </p>
<p>No msm in California reported the following:</p>
<p><i>In an appellate court brief, Assistant LA City Attorney Tony Leung argued the 30-day impoundment for driving without a license was an appropriate punishment, the least severe one in fact for what is a crime, not just an infraction.</i></p>
<p>From the brief:</p>
<p><i>Unlicensed drivers in California have 4.9 times as many fatal crashes apiece as licensed drivers</i></p>
<p><i>At any given time, it is estimated by the California Department of Motor Vehicles that 1,000,000 persons are estimated to be driving without ever having been licensed at all.</i></p>
<p><i>Californians who comply with the law are frequently victims of traffic accidents caused by unlicensed drivers. These innocent victims suffer considerable pain and property loss at the hands of people who flaunt the law.</i> </p>
<p><i>Seizing the vehicles used by unlicensed drivers serves a significant governmental and public interest, namely the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of Californians</i></p>
<p>One Bill Gil doesn&rsquo;t give a  * about the safety of Californians.  He only cares about flooding California with as many destitute hispanic welfare users as possible and giving them all driver&rsquo;s licenses!!</p>
<p>Wonder how the Rowe family feels about this?</p>
<p><i>Rosenberg cited the Aug. 19 crash in Santa Rosa in which a 4-year-old boy, Christopher &#8216;Buddy&rsquo; Rowe, was killed while crossing the street. The driver was a suspected illegal immigrant who had been arrested twice in the past for driving without a license.</i></p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s left of the Bologna family of SF:</p>
<p><i>The victims, Tony Bologna, 48, and his sons, Michael, 20, and Matthew, 16, were gunned down in their Honda Civic as they were heading home from a Sunday afternoon family barbecue in Fairfield.</i>  </p>
<p><i>The driver drove alongside the Bolognas and, without a word, opened fire. Illegal alien Edwin Ramos, 21, pleaded not guilty to triple murder charges.</i></p>
<p>Brown is a wild card.  I give this a 50-50 chance of being signed into law.</p>

<p>How many contradictions can you find in that? These are aliens, invaders, felons by definition. Their cars and property should be confiscated, as it is ill gotten gain, and they all should be deported! </p>
<p>And yet, Gil Cedillo protects them! As he is very possibly the child of this invading horde!</p>

<p>Maybe not totally funded by welfare.  Hollywood will be used to crank out films and commercials about how wonderful Mexicans in California are and how wonderfully fun they are for everyone.  And people will go to see those movies and so they will have some of their own money.  I think I notice that going on now, in fact where blacks are concerned, RE; &#8220;Shine&#8221; and now &#8220;The Help.&#8221;  Just watch for the run of Hispanic &#8220;Grapes of Wrath&#8221; films coming soon.</p>

		<p>For all intents and purposes California is Mexico. Whites are not even the majority there anymore. You&rsquo;ve got minority gangs running all around. Alot of them from South America. You can&rsquo;t go to a home depot without seeing  a 1000 illegals  loitering. To get around in southern california you might as well learn spanish. In some places spanish is the first language. </p>
<p>I say let them have california. Let all of the whites leave. Let california drop out of the union.  Let only minority money pay for that state. Let them speak whatever language they wish. Let the blacks and hispanics annihilate one another with their gang banging. Put up a big fence around california. If they want it, let them maintain it. Watch as it turns into a third world sess pool run by mini dictators and drug lords from mexico. And if any white liberals want to stay, let them, but they must renounce their American citizenship and never return.</p>
<p>Adios California!</p>

		<p>So are the officers just going to allow the drivers to drive off?  I mean, if they aren&rsquo;t arrested, and in the middle of I-5, I can&rsquo;t see them just walking home.  So either the cop gives them a ride home or they get to drive their car (which now can&rsquo;t be impounded by some made up interpretation of the 4th amendment yet Obamacare is somehow constitutional).</p>
<p>Of course, the question follows, what is stopping serial drunk drivers who rightly lost their license from driving?  Ironically, this is also a huge problem of the illegal Mexican alien.  Yet now an intoxicated, illegal alien without a license can apparently drive home after being stopped by the cops and receiving a ticket for a later court date he won&rsquo;t ever show up to.  </p>

		<p>Anybody who doesn&rsquo;t have a driver&rsquo;s license shouldn&rsquo;t be driving. Although the public transportation could be better in many parts of America, it does exist as an alternative to driving. I thought that you needed a driver&rsquo;s license in order to get insurance.   </p>

		<p>This is a classic liberal argument! We&rsquo;re not condoning unlicensed driving, but&hellip; Or my favorite: law abiding illegal immigrants. That&rsquo;s like saying jumbo shrimp or visionary politics. The two terms just don&rsquo;t go together.  You know, like that Sencion guy in Nevada who shot up an IHOP and killed those National Guardsmen. He was a law abiding mass murderer. What a crazy upside-down world we live in. Whites have been raised to basically look after themselves, and step on the fellow Whites instead of encouraging them. </p>
<p>This is an American tragedy because it goes to show all of us how a sense of community has fallen in the US. Whites have gotten too comfortable in their status in this society, where law enforcement won&rsquo;t even speak an ill word of a minority involved in a crime out of fear of losing his job and pension. Someone somewhere would employ you. Stand up for your community.</p>

<p>So this Bandito is looking to Legalize a Criminal act. The first Criminal act is crossing into our Country, without permission from US Immigration. </p>

<p>Mrs. Bolgana sued the city for releasing Ramos without notifying ICE. Cause of action was that if the city had notified ICE he would have been held because he was under an existing deportation order and would have been in jail instead of driving with a weapon.</p>

		<p>I live in Washington State, one of the two states in this nation that  allows illegal immigrants to hold valid drivers licences. (The other one being New Mexico.) Even with illegals being allowed to have driver&rsquo;s licences, about half of them do not even bother getting them. When an unlicensed illegal driver is in an accident, they often take to their heels, leaving the helpless innocent victim of the crash sitting there. </p>

		<p>Bon, #9: Jerry Brownnose is not a wild card.  He will certainly sign this bill.  Anonymous #20: I have written two letters to SF District Attorney Gascon, urging him to seek the Death Penalty for the triple killer of the Bolognas. Now I have read that he has done a switch, and will not seek the death penalty in ANY case.  If I meet him personally, I will tell him some real bad things.

<p>While I understand your frustration with the state of the state of California, and you&rsquo;re willingness to &#8220;throw in the towel&#8221; as they say, and call it a day, I&rsquo;d encourage you not to give up the fight.</p>
<p>California, with all of its problems, is more than just a state that takes up much of the West  &mdash;  -some say &#8220;Left Coast&#8221;.  The loss of California is the loss of the 8th largest economy in the enire world; in other words, nothing to sneeze at; not just a &#8220;loss&#8221;  &mdash;  -a HUGE loss.</p>
<p>If California goes, whatever else is left (read:  targeted for Hispaniczation) will not be nearly as difficult to follow along the same path, I think.</p>

<p>However, we have facilitated our own destruction.  How many people have had Mexicans put on their new roof or do their yard work, because it&rsquo;s &#8220;cheaper&#8221;?    Do your part.

You want to know how your town is doing in regards to Mexicans just take a look at the local school system. If 10% of the city&rsquo;s  population is Mexican you can bet the schools have about 50% Mexican students. Just take a look at the schools, it is a good barometer for things to come.</p>

<p>With all due respect, movies are no longer made in Hollywood. The studios moved to Burbank many years ago. They did this for more space and lower taxes. More recently, they have moved and expanded to other states, even other countries for tax havens. What&rsquo;s good for the goose isn&rsquo;t necessarily good for the gander, I guess. </p>
<p>In Hollywood, all that is left is cheap, tourstic memorabilia and tattoo parlors.  It&rsquo;s a great place to buy crack though. Crack is everywhere in Hollywood. There is crystal meth also, for the more uppity types.  I guess that&rsquo;s what liberal media creates&hellip;drugs, rape, murder&hellip;and then they move on to expand. </p>
