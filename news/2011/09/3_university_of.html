<h1>3 University of Michigan Researchers Win Macarthur Foundation &#8216;Genius Grants&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ann Arbor, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Three researchers from the University of Michigan are among the latest 22 recipients of the no-strings-attached MacArthur Foundation &#8220;genius grants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $500,000 fellowships for 2011 were announced today by the Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. University of Michigan researchers on the list include Tiya Miles, Melanie Sanford and Yukiko Yamashita.</p>
<p>Miles is director of the Department of Afroamerican &amp; African Studies in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. Sanford is a chemistry professor in LSA. And Yamashita is an assistant professor at the Life Sciences Institute and an assistant professor at Michigan&rsquo;s medical school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Miles is a public historian who is reframing and reinterpreting the history of the nation &#8220;in works that illuminate the complex interrelationships between the African and Cherokee peoples in colonial America,&#8221; U-M said.</p>
<p>She said the funding will help her advance a new project she started called ECO Girls, which is based in the Department of Afroamerican &amp; African Studies. The mission of ECO Girls is to foster environmental awareness and stewardship, ecological literacy, cultural education, friendship building, self-confidence and leadership skills for elementary and middle school girls in the southeastern Michigan cities of Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Detroit, U-M said.</p>
<p>Sanford is an organometallic chemist, U-M said. Her research focuses on using metal-based agents, primarily palladium, to catalyze reactions that substitute hydrogen in carbon-hydrogen bonds with other atoms or functional groups, according to the release.</p>
<p>Yamashita, a stem cell biologist, is working to explain the process of stem cell division and its role in age-related decline in organ repair and in the onset of some cancers and other disorders, U-M said.</p>

<p>Evidently the Cherokee don&rsquo;t care too much about those complex relationships since they want blacks expelled from the tribe. </p>
<p>What a laughable exercise in futility to try to compare the works of serious scientists working on complex problems to a revisionist pro black &#8220;historian&#8221; with an obvious agenda.  I&rsquo;m sure Ms. Miles would be an asset to a public library somewhere but to compare her work to that of those above her is utterly ridiculous.  </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s &#8220;reframing&#8221; and &#8220;reinterpreting&#8221; - that&rsquo;s so funny. They have a lot of nerve putting this woman with the other two as if that will make them equal.  Pulling the wool doesn&rsquo;t mean sane people will believe this baloney&hellip;</p>

<p>Three female researchers from the University of Michigan walk into a bar. And the bartender says, &#8220;Only two of you gals have any talent. &#8216;Public Historian&rsquo;? What the hell&rsquo;s that? Get out of my bar, you affirmative-action fraud!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Tiya Miles-I wonder what practical benefit her research will do for anyone? Same old story-have some balance by having a white, a black, and a yellow.They gave a Genius award to some black racist quite a few years ago, his name was Leroy something.All he ever did in his lifetime was to spew out racist garbage.  </p>

<p>Yes because we all know that it takes real mental power to attain status at the head Afroamerican &amp; African Studies department.</p>
<p>Truly such &#8220;public historians&#8221; rival those in stem cell biology organometallic chemistry.</p>

		<p>Tiya Miles is your typical Black PhD  &mdash;  she&rsquo;s awarded her affirmative action degree in Cultural Marxism because everyone knows that Blacks are incapable of earning a legitimate degree in the hard sciences.  She will be coddled her entire career, and her ludicrous ideas will never be seriously challenged for fear of &#8220;racism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Miles&rsquo; work is proof that the term &#8220;Black genius&#8221; is an oxymoron.<br>

They were searching pretty hard but this is all they have got. </p>
<p>It is like here in Germany: They wanted to talk about stem-cell science on TV. But there were no black or brown scientists in Germany so they invited an Indian from England to prevent only 5 whites talking in the show.</p>

		<p>#8 Anonymous, it seems to be a common conceit of many &#8220;white nationalists&#8221; that Asians are smart but somehow incapable of original thought.  How many Asians do you actually know?  I know of plenty of Asians who have had original and useful ideas and I&rsquo;m pretty sure that Yukiko Yamashita is in that category.  I suspect that Jared Taylor knows some bright and creative Asians as well.</p>
<p>We can be proud of our own people without belittling other people who have, in fact, much of their own to be proud of.</p>
<p>As for the Macarthur grants, they are commonly split between scientists of genuine ability and accomplishment and leftist activist crazies.</p>

		<p>50 years of white guilt affirmative action has produced this.  A &#8220;public historian&#8221; provides nothing to the betterment of our society. Why do liberals and the liberal media ignore white public historians? Because they provide no liberal white guilt relief.</p>
