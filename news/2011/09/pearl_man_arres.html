			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marsha Thompson, WLBT, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A high ranking federal TSA official is behind bars charged with killing his female co-worker on the Mississippi gulf coast. D&rsquo;Iberville police quickly transported Ruben Orlando Benitez, 45, back to the coast Tuesday after he was arrested at his home in Pearl. </p>
<p>The investigation revealed sometime Saturday night Benitez and Stacey Wright, who were allegedly having an affair, got into a fight at Wright&rsquo;s apartment. The fight escalated into a grisly crime. The young mother was stabbed repeatedly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police are tight lipped about the relationship Wright had with her accused killer and co-worker here in Jackson. They are also not discussing what lead up to the deadly confrontation.</p>

		<p>I couldn&rsquo;t count the number of times I&rsquo;ve explained to people that I avoid flying, not because I&rsquo;m afraid of Terrorists, but because of the people screening passengers.</p>
<p>Frankly, I haven&rsquo;t flown for pleasure since 9/11, and have managed to cut business travel by 80%.  I realize, now, that I will never see Europe or Canada again.  This &#8216;High Official&rsquo; is a prime example of why that is.  Why would someone like this have been given a position which would allow him to make decisions which affect the American Public?  How could such a being possibly make me more safe?</p>

		<p>Is she wearing contacts?  I never realized how beautiful blue eyes are with dark skin. They just blaze out. Sad. Isn&rsquo;t one of the leading causes of death for black women being killed by the man in her life?</p>
<p>Just another day in da hood.  Typical civil service couple. Usually they bring all their drama to work.</p>
<p>Affirmative action in action.  At least he didn&rsquo;t kill a passenger who rebuffed his advances.</p>

		<p>As he said, I feel SO much safer with the likes of THOSE two being responsible for safety and profiling/ident of threats passing through their hands.  And I feel SO much safer with a TSA management who is responsible for hiring such stellar individuals to safeguard our nation&rsquo;s skies.  </p>

		<p>This, the faces of the TSA. Some real good security workers there. Police don&rsquo;t want to discuss what &#8220;lead up&#8221; to the killing. Probably nothing of any importance whatever; people like this have fights over trivial things all the time. It&rsquo;s a cultural thing most other people wouldn&rsquo;t understand.  </p>

		<p>I was really angry with Bush for firing all the pre 911 screeners. Box cutters were not illegal to take aboard aircraft and the screeners on 911 did nothing wrong.</p>

		<p>This guy was a high ranking TSA official??!!  Another confirmation that this country is deliberately destroying itself.  I agree with poster #1, take the train, or even a ship.  Forget the sky, or own your own jet.</p>
<p>And&hellip;.. I don&rsquo;t believe Stacy Wright&rsquo;s blue eyes are hers.  These are vanity contacts.  All she needs is a blond wig.</p>
