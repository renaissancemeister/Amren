<h1><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2038948/50-babies-day-born-Polish-mothers-UK.html">More Children in Britain Born to Polish Mothers than Those from Any Other Foreign Country</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Doyle, Daily Mail (London), September 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than one in every 40 newborns in the UK are born to Polish mothers, it has emerged.</p>
<p>More children are born in Britain to women from Poland than those from any other foreign country, research shows.</p>
<p>Last year nearly 20,000 babies were born to Polish migrants  &mdash;  that is more than 50 a day and amounts to one in every 37 newborns.</p>
<p>Official figures show that in just six years the number of children born to Polish women has increased nearly six-fold. In 2005  &mdash;  the year after Britain opened its borders to workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries  &mdash;  the number was lower than 3,500.</p>
<p>The figures illustrate the scale and speed of Polish migration since the expansion of the European Union, and the effects of the Labour government&rsquo;s decision not to impose restrictions on worker numbers.</p>
<p>The so-called &#8216;migrant baby boom&rsquo; means that across the country, one in four of all children is born to a mother who was born overseas.</p>
<p>That figure has doubled in just ten years as migrant numbers have exploded.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migrationwatch, said: &#8216;This is an extraordinary increase. There must be concern that the  numbers will grow even more rapidly now that Eastern Europeans have full access to the welfare state in Britain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Department of Health figures show the number of children born here to Polish mothers hit a new high last year.</p>
<p>Between 2001 and 2009, mothers from Pakistan gave birth to the highest number of foreign-born babies in England and Wales, but last year it was women from Poland.</p>
<p>The figures show that there were 1,392 births to Polish mothers in 2003, the year before EU expansion, and this rose to 1,830 the following year.</p>
<p>In 2005, it nearly doubled to 3,403 and then rose sharply again to 6,620 in 2006. Last year the figure stood at 19,762. Poland is one of the former Eastern Bloc countries which joined the EU in 2004, and the Government is hamstrung in its ability to restrict immigration.</p>
<p>Before the door was opened, Labour predicted 13,000 migrants would come to this country as a result.</p>
<p>But with other EU counties restricting access to their labour markets, Britain became a target destination for workers.</p>
<p>Since 2004, up to 900,000 Poles have been granted a National Insurance number, which is needed for them to get a job.</p>
<p>At the peak, between 2006 and 2008, some 20,000 Poles every month were coming to the UK for work.</p>
<p>Numbers of Eastern Europeans fell during the recession but have picked up again in recent months  &mdash;  despite no sign of an economic recovery.</p>
<p>British taxpayers fork out for child benefit payments to tens of thousands of migrant workers, because EU rules allow them to live at home while claiming here. Approximately 50,000 children of migrant workers receive the benefit  &mdash;  even though the youngsters still live in their home countries.</p>
<p>Treasury figures show that Poles make up the vast majority of the payments  &mdash;  accounting for  37,941 children last year  &mdash;  at a cost of Â£24million a year.</p>
<p>Critics say the flood of arrivals has placed huge pressure on housing, education and the health service  &mdash;  especially maternity units.</p>
<p>The Polish influence has also been felt in schools. Five years ago, just 200 students sat a Polish GCSE  &mdash;  last year, the figure was 1,900.</p>
<p>Figures for the numbers of children born to foreign-born mothers in specific regions of the country are not broken down by individual countries.</p>
<p>But figures show Eastern European migrant mothers accounted for more than one in four babies in Boston, Lincolnshire. In total last year, one in every four children born in England and Wales was to a foreign-born mother  &mdash;  a total of 181,827 children.</p>
<p>In May, rules restricting access to welfare benefits for Eastern European workers coming to Britain were scrapped because of EU rules restricting how long they can be held in place  &mdash;  raising fears of mass benefits tourism.</p>

		<p>The average Polish IQ is 107.  The average English IQ is 100.  <br>
The IQ obsessed American Renaissance should be jumping for joy.</p>
<p>If enough Polish babies grow up and marry English spouses the average IQ of the English should rise by maybe .7 in the next century.</p>

		<p>I see no problem with this, being polish myself I have had no problem assimilating to mainstream society here in the USA. The way I see it the more polish immigrants the better, but if we really are such a burden then I guess letting in more Somalis and other assorted East Africans is probable the smarter thing to do.</p>

		<p>Actually, all Poles I know are quite attractive, family oriented and hard-working. As the numbers of non-whites in Britain are skyrocketing, the increasing numbers of poles might counteract it. And most of them will return to Poland after a while since Poland is no longer a communist, underdeveloped greyish country (I&rsquo;ve been there). </p>

		<p>Oh, no!  Britain is being invaded by White people!  We could use more of those Poles here in the U.S. to counter balance all of the non-White latinos, africans, asians, and arabs.  </p>
<p>Within one generation, those Poles will be indistinguishable from the native British population.  Many of their children will have blond hair and blue eyes  &mdash;  or light brown hair and light brown eyes.  And they are still practicing Christians by and large.  What&rsquo;s the problem here  &mdash;  that the Poles will take away jobs from the Pakistanis, Haitians, and Indians?  Hurray for that.</p>
<p>Since the time that Poland entered the EU, many Brits have taken advantage of the exchange rate to buy up prime Polish real estate in places like Krakow  &mdash;  and driven up all real estate prices to the point that the average Pole can&rsquo;t afford to own a home in their own country.  So maybe having all these Poles moving to Britain is just a little payback, eh?</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know what the Poles&rsquo; problem is but I can say that if the Western Liberal elites hadn&rsquo;t destroyed Yugoslavia (which had a living standard comparable to the West in the 70s &amp; mid-80s), 4/5 of the Serbs living in the West right now wouldn&rsquo;t be living here, which we do for compensation instead of working 6 days a week for 300 euros a month back home thanks to the West. But I don&rsquo;t understand why the Poles are here in such numbers. </p>

		<p>Take this with a grain of salt. A lot of these &#8220;Poles&#8221; may in reality be gypsies. Just like when you hear about &#8220;Romanians&#8221; or &#8220;Bulgarians&#8221; committing crime in Western Europe, odds are they&rsquo;re gypsies.</p>

		<p>Thats not surprising, here in my neck of the woods in queens new york,polish people are in general hard working church going catholics. On the streets in my neibourhood its a virtualbrigade of polish mommies with their babies AND they&rsquo;re in  overwhelming majority MARRIED, you know like married in a church in a ceromony.Although they are for the most part very good people I wish they would master english a little better and a little quicker, that would seem to be the only deficit that they have,most polish I knowin my neirbourhood seem to be from the old austrian hapsburg regions or the old east and west prussian lands as well as pomerania and silesia some of course are from the other areas such as warsaw,krakow etc. I find polish people are very interested in history,and lets face it, they have themselves a very rich and interesting history.</p>

		<p>I can understand a certain level of concern on behalf of the British. It&rsquo;s not a nice feeling to have your country &#8220;flooded&#8221; by anyone, especially if they&rsquo;re everywhere when you walk around in public, speaking foreign languages left and right and just behaving culturally different. If the roles where reversed it would probably be the same. I&rsquo;m sure they simply feel overwhelmed and that it&rsquo;s coming from all angles. I doubt too many at all would have a problem with controlled migration from Eastern Europe, and particularly wouldn&rsquo;t have in the mid-90s and earlier, before the flood gates were well and truly opened by the Labor government. Maybe also a bit of &#8220;once bitten, twice shy&#8221; given their past and present experiences with immigrants from elsewhere. I wouldn&rsquo;t be quite so hard on them.</p>

<p>You are wrong about Yugoslavia having a similar or comparable living standard to the West in the 70s and 80s.  I have lived there.  In those times the most common car was a Zastava, which was a bad copy of a certain super compact Fiat, many people still did their washing with a tub and scrub board or used an outside laundry service.  Even today, most still hand their laundry out to dry, and by out, I mean often in, due to the rain, and by in, I mean strung up indoors in their living rooms, bedrooms, etc., because few people have drying machines.  Most people still live in apartments (flats), many of which were constructed during the Yugoslav period, although many homes have been built since then.  They do take more leisure time, and IMO know how to enjoy life better than Americans, at any rate.  But many drink to excess and smoking is still a widespread habit. Haute Culture is a fascade, these are people who will add a teaspoon of sugar to their red wine.  They like it sweet and love sweets in general.  Personal hygiene including dental hygiene has only improved a bit in the past 10-15 years.  I always know when I am back in the Balkans; the smell of BO is strong even on the Adria Airlines that go there from Frankfurt airport. For all that, they can be really endearing people, loyal in friendship in a way that many American families cannot even match.</p>

<p>Are you kidding ?  Not only was the former Yugoslavia the epitome of dysfunctional multiculturalism, but also flawed Communism when it ended up completely bankrupt by the late 80&rsquo;s: <a href="https://goo.gl/MfU8w" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/MfU8w</a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly why the more affluent Northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia jointly declared their independence on June 25, 1991 to stop supporting Yugoslavia&rsquo;s rampant inflation, high unemployment and skyrocketing foreign debt.  Sorry, but the former Yugoslavia never had a &#8220;living standard comparable to the West&#8221;, especially when over 1.1 million workers and dependents were already living and working outside Yugoslavia&rsquo;s borders by 1973 : <a href="https://goo.gl/PY6GJ" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/PY6GJ</a></p>
<p>Sounds to me like you&rsquo;re mostly here because you are still bitter about Milosevic losing his wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo where Serbs never were the majority in the first place. Of all people, Serbs are certainly not in the position to blame the &#8220;Western Liberal elites&#8221; when they slaughtered thousands of their neighbors&rsquo; civilians to impose their minorities as part of MULTICULTURAL and COMMUNIST YUGOSLAVIA&hellip;Thank God Yugoslavia is gone and don&rsquo;t remind me who started WW1!</p>

		<p> God bless Poland!  I don&rsquo;t see this as bad news if the births are to real Poles and not Gypsies as &#8220;Justin&#8221; has indicated. However, I thought more real Poles were returning to Poland?

		<p>The problem for Britain regarding immigrants, whether they are white or not is that we have too many!  This is a small country - I believe we compare in size to Oregon.  Since the end of the second world war the population has gone from about 40 million (which the British Govt. admits is about right for our size) to 62 million at present (and rising).  East European migrants are noted for their work ethic, BUT they lower the overall wage rate. Minimum wage is difficult to live on unless you are prepared to exist in overcrowded conditions with a low standard of living.  Most are not high earners and many will be able to claim top-up benefits.   As you can see from the article British taxpayers now support Polish children who have never been here. Where is the sense in that? The people of Boston in Lincolnshire will give you an argument over whether they should be welcome or not - their community has been overrun and has had many  problems with those from another culture.  It never works. </p>

		<p>It strikes me that this article is a carefully-worded propaganda piece designed to reassure the reader that &#8220;migrant workers&#8221; and &#8220;migrant mothers&#8221; are White Poles and not blacks and browns.  But it isn&rsquo;t White Poles who are building mosques, rioting, murdering, raping and breeding like rats.</p>
<p>Apparently it&rsquo;s okay to point fingers and complain, as long as the &#8220;migrants&#8221; being pointed at are White Europeans.<br>

		<p>I have mixed feelings about this.  </p>
<p>The Poles are an admirable people.  They&rsquo;re white, hard-working and attractive   &mdash;   certainly a major improvement over the Afro and the Paki.  But they&rsquo;re not Anglo, let alone Celtic, Norman, Viking or other Western European stock.  To see footage of English crowds of the 60s, 70s and even 80s, with distinct appearances (think of the Beatles movie, &#8220;A Hard Day&rsquo;s Night&#8221;), is to see, painfully, documentation of an identity gone forever. </p>
<p>To preserve English identity, one thing must be done above all else:  Abolish all Third World immigration. </p>

		<p>As a 5th generation Polish-American, I&rsquo;m glad to see most people supporting the idea of Poles settling in Britain as opposed to Pakistanis, Arabs, Bangladeshis, Africans and others; but I can&rsquo;t help but feel that many people still feel that Poles are second class, even if they&rsquo;re white and better than the third world hoards. I grew up at a time when &#8220;Polack&#8221; jokes were ubiquitous in America and it wasn&rsquo;t easy. Every time I opened my mouth and mentioned my last name, I knew I was in for it. That&rsquo;s not to say that other white ethnics didn&rsquo;t get teased as well, but Poles were the national joke, not just regional. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s different in England, but like one poster on here said, they&rsquo;re not Anglos, or Celtic, or Viking or Teutonic  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re Slavs. I don&rsquo;t know whether thousands of Poles moving to England is a good or bad thing, but I do know which group will assimilate easier and blend it better than an African. </p>

		<p>Anonymous at 21 and 25 and Pat at 31 are spot on. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Poles in England except:-</p>
<p>1/ their willingness to work for low wages has depressed the living and working standards of British workers and </p>
<p>2/ they are not British! We have been so overwhelmed with foreigners of every conceivable kind that we feel that our country is slipping away - and now this.</p>
<p>Unlike some of our other immigrants Poles in small numbers are entirely assimilable without causing significant racial change, but the numbers are not small, and unlike previous immigrations they have gone to parts of the country (rural parts and small towns)which have not previously received immigrants and which therefore remained, until only the other year, strongholds of Englishness.</p>
<p>The only crumb of comfort is that the rate of increase seems to be slowing.</p>

		<p>Franz - I agree; I don&rsquo;t think the Yugo standard was all that high, but I also know it was all the rage to blame the Serbs for everything, and no blame for the other parties. The Hague was loaded up with Serbs, but no Croats or moslems to speak of. Ah yes, my beloved US and Nato break every rule in the book by conducting a 78-day bombing run against Serb military and comm assets - really? 78 days over a piece of real estate that size? We either have junk for an air force, or we were hitting civilian targets (and yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what we were doing). No one seems to give a crap that some 800,000 Serbs were executed by the Croatian Ustasi. There was definitely a history there, and yes, Tito mixing the population and the blow-up that followed his death is a prime example of the perils of diversity. </p>
<p>Sorry, way off topic, but I&rsquo;m just sick of the lying media and the Serb-bashing. </p>

		<p>Ideally Britain would have no immigrants, everybody living there would be ethnically British and the island would have a replacement birthrate. In reality this is not so. Poles at least are an investment in the future of the white community there. Personally I wish those 900,000 Poles had come to Canada, instead of the black, brown and yellow riff-raff we get from the third world. </p>

		<p>Now, Poles (or their offspring) seem to be a problem ? My, my &hellip;Just, this lowering-of-wages-due-to-immigration stuff has been rolling for decades, almost immediately after the end of the WW2. East Indians, Pakistanis, Indians, Nigerians, Arabs, sheiks and rastas, voodoo and turbans- this wasn&rsquo;t much of trouble in 1950s, 1960s, 1970s,..should I go on ? But Poles- who were the only Whites who pushed back &amp; drove away Blacks on rampage in recent orgy of pillage and vandalism in Londonistan (whilst &#8220;natives&#8221; either looked by passively, or even &#8220;joined&#8221; the mob)- now, they are a burden. Makes one sick, indeed.  </p>
<p>As for Croats &amp; Serbs, I&rsquo;m not impartial- I&rsquo;m a Croat. So, just a link to clarify a few misinfo (it&rsquo;s OT, anyway):  https://goo.gl/9MCoZ </p>

		<p>As an American I&rsquo;d rather see those Poles in the USA - I have a feeling that ethnic homelands should remain just that - ethnic homelands.  I&rsquo;m sure the Poles wouldn&rsquo;t be thrilled if the English were in their homeland to the point where they were threatening to displace the Polish or worse, change them forever through intermixing.  I like Polish people - send them to the USA so we can divert some of the &#8220;need&#8221; for Mexicans.</p>

		<p>There must be some element of deceit in this reported statistic. Undoubtedly, the largest number of children born to ethnically non-British parents are Muslim, but parents born in Britain.

		<p>Re:  41 Doc:<br>
Good points; I tend to get a bit emotional, since I feel things were not portrayed in a realistic light here in the US. I&rsquo;m not Serbian, I have no ties to the region. I suppose this is around the time I started paying attention to things. I believe the Moslems utilized an American PR company during the conflict. Perhaps the Serbs should have done the same. Essentially, to me, it just seems there were three vicious parties, with one scapegoat. Kosovo does open another can of worms; if it can be recognized, why not a Boer or Basque state?  Thanks</p>

I agree that our hope does lie in Eastern Europe and Russia.  I believe they have a healthier perception of themselves as white people.  They have not been subject to white racial battery over the past 20 or 30 years culminating in deracination and still have a very healthy and traditional view of things.  They tend to be horrified, openly, at miscegeny etc.  I&rsquo;d be glad to welcome more of them here but they work too hard and are blond and blue-eyed, so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be seeing any in the near future&hellip;.</p>

		<p>In reguards to the apperance of polish people,I always see them as what is know as western slavs,you really think that they are of scandinavian stock or german.Most of these people if they said to me iam german or swedish i would belive them,as i said earlier a great many are from the old german areas,Ive meet some from danzig and from breslau they all look like heinies to me.</p>
<p>polish people have a great affinty believe it or not for england,this goes back to WWII when britain whether for right or wrong went to war on her behalf,later in the war, thousands of polish servicemen served there to include the piots who served with great distintion in the RAF. Two of the polish combat units left from there to fight on the continent, the 1st polish armored division in normandy till VE day and the famous 1st polish parachute brigade in holland in operation market garden.The majority of them to include those troops that fought in italy settled in england after the war,they not wanting to go home as it was already established that they would be treated as suspect by the russians and their polish communist apparatchiks for being in the west and fighting on the behalf of the now outlawed polish goverment in exile.<br>

<p>Nonsense Justin. There are very few gypsies in Poland nowadays.<br>
I know many Polish immigrants who live in UK. They are all native Polish. Poland is likely the most homogenus nation in Europe. Number of Poles living in UK is estimated to be somewhere around one million.<br>
Apart from Polish, there are many Lituanians, Latvians, Estoninans, Romanians and other Eastern Europeans in UK and other Western Europ. countries. Romanians and orher EEs are the largest group of recent immigrants in France, Spain and Italy. Leftiest media doesn&rsquo;t talk much about it because it doesn&rsquo;t promote their &#8220;diversity&#8221; perception ideas. It&rsquo;s easy for them to move because they are part of EU.

		<p>#7 The smarter thing to do would be not to take any immigrants at all.</p>
<p>#11 Do you have a source for the real estate comment? I&rsquo;ve yet to meet a Polish property owner from (i.e ethnic British) the UK.</p>
<p>#12 Could you clarify what you mean by compensation? The Poles are in Western European nations as the wages are higher. Others intend to stay as the living standards are higher. That&rsquo;s what Polish people I&rsquo;ve met have told me.</p>
<p>#15 Not sure I understand the analogy and it was 70 years ago. A good thing for whom? Certainly not our already struggling National Health Service.</p>
<p>#16 Did anyone else participate in that battle?</p>
<p>#17 I&rsquo;ve got a better program. Britain takes none of them.</p>
<p>#21 Indeed. There are immigrants even in rural villages now. People didn&rsquo;t really have a problem with controlled migration from Eastern Europe in the past. They and there descendants eg England International soccer players such as Andy Johnson, Phil Jagielka &amp; Paul Konchesky were assimilated. However essentially unlimited EU migration of millions into a small Island in a few years has caused big problems for British society. As you say the reverse scenario of say half a million British people migrating to Poland would surely have negative consequences for them.</p>
<p>#24 I think the majority view it from their own generally &#8216;White American&rsquo; perspective. </p>
<p>#27 No, despite what elements of the British media have stated statistics show there&rsquo;s been no real Polish exodus. For more details search for articles by Prof Krystyna Iglicka.</p>
