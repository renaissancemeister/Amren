<h1>Study: White Students More Likely to Win Scholarships</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erica Perez, California Watch, September 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A national report released this week by financial aid guru Mark Kantrowitz finds minority students are less likely to win private scholarships or receive merit-based institutional grants than Caucasian students  &mdash;  a pattern that also holds true in California.</p>
<p>The analysis, based on 2003-04 and 2007-08 data for hundreds of thousands of students from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, found that nationally, Caucasian students are 40 percent more likely to win private scholarships than minority students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kantrowitz, who publishes the popular college financial aid websites FinAid and Fastweb and does consulting in computer science, artificial intelligence, and statistical and policy analysis, said he decided to embark on the study because he read a news story that repeated a claim he hears often: White students don&rsquo;t get their fair share of scholarships.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>WFAA-TV in Dallas reported in June that a new nonprofit group, the Former Majority Association for Equality, awards scholarships for whites only. Colby Bohannan, one of the group&rsquo;s founders, told WFAA that &#8220;it just got really frustrating when every other scholarship you happen to find online, you need not apply to based on your ethnicity or gender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It struck me that he didn&rsquo;t have any evidence for that statement, and it was an interesting question,&#8221; Kantrowitz said in an interview. He asked the question of the data and found the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that the race myth is busted,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is no evidence to support statements that minority students get more than their fair share of scholarships. If anything, Caucasian students receive more than their fair share &hellip; by a significant margin.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kantrowitz&rsquo;s study focused most closely on private scholarships offered by outside groups and merit-based or non-need-based scholarships offered by colleges and universities themselves. He found that nationally, Caucasian students still were more likely to win private scholarships than African American, Latino or Asian students, even after adjusting for differences in financial need, high school GPA or college GPA.</p>
<p>Among low-income students, 7 percent of white students received private scholarships, compared with 5 percent of minority students. Among students with high school GPAs of 3.5 or better, 11 percent of white students received private scholarships, compared with 8 percent of minorities.</p>
<p>White students also were more likely to receive institutional merit-based grants, Kantrowitz found. Universities often use these scholarships as recruiting tools to woo academically attractive students who have no demonstrated financial need.</p>
<p>Kantrowitz said he doesn&rsquo;t see private scholarships as deliberately discriminatory. Most scholarships do not use racial preferences at all, he said. But many private scholarships tend to &#8220;perpetuate historical inequities in the distribution of scholarships according to race,&#8221; he wrote.</p>

		<p>Maybe because more white students have social lives; they are more likely to volunteer and be active in their community.   Having gone to a school with many asians, they are about as fun a pet rock.  Yes, they get high marks, but they are rarely outside of the library. </p>

		<p>Did they include Asians as &#8216;whites&rsquo; or &#8216;minorities&rsquo; in the study?</p>
<p>In California, there are far, far more Asians studying math and science fields than there are whites. FACTS!</p>

<p>Who is he trying to kid? Check out Gates&rsquo; scholarship program which is not available to whites, or the Coca-Cola scholarships, equally anti-white, among many, many others. How many minority athletes are given admission to schools they are not prepared for, on full or partial scholarships they don&rsquo;t qualify for? And then have &#8216;tutors&rsquo; assigned to them to do their work and take their tests? </p>
<p>Our own experience: received a call from the University of Notre Dame admissions office saying they needed to know daughter&rsquo;s race (which we intentionally left off all applications in the belief that decisions should be based on merit alone) in order to make a decision on both her admission and their proposed major scholarship award. Guess the outcome? Race blind decisions, yeah sure. </p>

		<p>Merit based are the key words in this story. Private scholarships are mainly given to students who have a proven record of achievement in school. These students are more likely to use their education to help them get good jobs and be a success in life. That is why they get the money.</p>

		<p>I guarantee this is a lie. He selectively picked his data. I went to school in the early 90s and bulletin boards were full of scholarships for blacks-only (both public and private).</p>
<p>Add the public scholarships and you will see the truth. </p>

Do whites win more scholarships or do they earn them?</p>
<p>They use the word win to imply whites are being unfairly favored by a rigged system.</p>

		<p>Kantrowitz&hellip;(gee, wonder what his nationality and politics are?) Huh, big mystery&hellip; is a fool and a liar. I worked in financial aid at a major university. The truth was, private scholarships were primarily offered based on very narrow qualifications, especially racial. You could go to the scholarship posting board on any day, and see that if you were a plain old white kid, you had slim pickings, if ANY. <br>
But they are private, so it tis the right of ANYBODY to offer that money for any reason they like. <br>
This fool and idiot- and LIAR is wrong on two glaring counts: that whites get more&hellip;WRONG, and that it should matter who gets such monies, because it&rsquo;s a free society, and this  cash is privately offered. prejudice and preference are the very essence of such scholarships. <br>
What a LOAD this slimeball idiot is.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Caucasian students are 40 percent more likely to win private scholarships than minority students&#8221;</p>
<p>Seems a little low given IQ distributions: are all the private scholarships purely meritocracy based?</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no evidence to support statements that minority students get more than their fair share of scholarships. If anything, Caucasian students receive more than their fair share &hellip; by a significant margin.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mendacious definition of &#8220;fair&#8221; when &#8220;more than fair share&#8221; is misdefined as being the result of awarding the &#8220;private&#8221; scholarship on merrit and accomplishment.  </p>
<p><br>
I presume any &#8220;non private&#8221; schlarships and indeed some private ones (such as Bill Gates&rsquo;s) favour minority stutus over objective merrits.</p>
<p>If there were no minorities in the USA, if they were replaced by an equivalent population of Whites then a great many Whites now missing out on scholarships and university entry in order to make way for affirmitive action appointments would be succesfull.</p>

		<p>If you go to the original article you&rsquo;ll see a table that lists various groups, their percentage of the student population and their percentage of private scholarship recipients. There are 7 groups listed.</p>
<p>The table separates whites from other groups in order to mislead readers into thinking whites were being favored. But that&rsquo;s NOT what&rsquo;s happening. Because whites are NOT the most likely to win scholarships. </p>
<p>If you crunch the numbers in the table you&rsquo;ll see that white students receive private scholarships at a rate approximately 5% higher than their percentage of the student population. But so do &#8220;Hispanic or Latino&#8221; and &#8220;Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander&#8221;. </p>
<p>Indeed, students of &#8220;More than one race&#8221; receive private scholarships at a rate 44% higher than their percentage of the student population. And &#8220;American Indian or Alaska Native&#8221; receive scholarships at a whopping 350% higher.</p>
<p>In fact, there are only two groups who don&rsquo;t receive private scholarships at a higher rate   &mdash;   &#8220;Asian&#8221; and &#8220;Black or African American&#8221;. I haven&rsquo;t read Kantrowitz&rsquo;s methodology but the lower rate for Asians seems fairly obvious   &mdash;   some of the Asian students are ineligible for the scholarships because they are not U.S. citizens.</p>

		<p>Here is the problem with &#8220;whites&#8221; as a group. Jews collectively are at the upper end of the scale. Gentiles are lower. As a result, Jews are massively overrepresented in colleges. Thus some 20% of Harvard undergrads are Jewish as compared to their 2% in the US population. If you look at Jews AND Gentiles as &#8220;white&#8221;, then &#8220;whites&#8221; are overrepresented at Harvard (and I expect as recipients of scholarships as well). Gentile whites, on the other hand, are underrepresented at Harvard. As roughly 70% of America&rsquo;s population, ethnic European Christendom forms a much smaller percentage of Harvard students.</p>
<p>Now consider what happens when they want to boost minority numbers: they take scholarships away from the dumber &#8220;white&#8221; students which they give to minorities with lesser credentials and keep giving scholarships to the smarter &#8220;white&#8221; students. As a result, the already-underrepresented white Gentiles become even more underrepresented. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be fooled. Whenever statistics for &#8220;whites&#8221; are reported for things like scholarships, college admissions, elite management jobs or the like, be sure you ask which &#8220;whites&#8221; in particular they are talking about. I can almost guarantee you it isn&rsquo;t Italian, Irish, or Polish Christians. So why are their kids getting their scholarships taken away and given to minorities?</p>
<p>Case on point: Samoans and other Melanesians and Micronesians are the &#8220;dumb&#8221; Asians, particularly as compared to &#8220;smart&#8221; Asians like Japanese and Koreans. The big racial category in California is &#8220;Asians and Pacific Islanders&#8221; which lumps them all together. The University of California system caps the total number of Asians to prevent the entire UC system from turning Asian. The Asians that get capped worst of all are the &#8220;dumb&#8221; Asians: Melanesians and Micronesians. As a result, so damn few of them were getting into UC schools that they demonstrated and agitated to be separated out into their own group.</p>
<p> White ethnics should do the same. As long as you are lumped in with the Jewish and Indian elite, you will suffer &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; discrimination until the white middle class is destroyed and you are begging for crumbs from their table.</p>

Actually according to the univeristy&rsquo;s admissions office, 88% of students do benefit from the state &#8220;bright futures&#8221; scholarship. Perhaps the previous poster made a slight typo and pushed 9 instead of 8.</p>

		<p>He might point out that 99.9% or so of racially selective scholarships, nearly every last one of them, is given out to students who aren&rsquo;t white and whites are not eligible for them. His field of inquiry is very narrow indeed. </p>

		<p><i>Here is the problem with &ldquo;whites&rdquo; as a group. Jews collectively are at the upper end of the scale. Gentiles are lower. As a result, Jews are massively overrepresented in colleges.</i> </p>
<p>You need to look more carefully at the data.</p>
<p>There are more high-IQd Whites of Christian origin in the US than Jewish due to sheer number (Jews make up 2-3% or the population as opposed to Whites at  ~ 65%):</p>
<p><i>One might simply suppose that this (Jewish overrepresentation at elite universities) is due to higher Jewish IQ. However, on the basis of Richard Lynn&rsquo;s estimates of Ashkenazi Jewish IQ and correcting for the greater numbers of European Whites, the ratio of non-Jewish Whites to Jews should be around 7 to 1 (IQ &gt;130) or  4.5 to 1 (IQ &gt; 145). Instead, the ratio of non-Jewish Whites to Jews is around 1 to 1 or less.</i></p>
<p>http://goo.gl/JzI3o</p>
<p>This shows clearly that Whites are being discriminated against in admissions to elite colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, Yale, et al.</p>
<p><i>The big racial category in California is &ldquo;Asians and Pacific Islanders&rdquo; which lumps them all together.</i></p>
<p>No longer is this being done.  </p>
<p>Asians from higher-IQ&rsquo;d countries such as China, Japan and Korea demanded that they be separated from lower IQ&rsquo;d Pacific Island nations.   Now Asian categories are separated by country of origin rather than the all-purpose &#8220;Asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, when will Whites be afforded the same privilege to separate us from lower IQ&rsquo;d Middle Easterners?</p>
