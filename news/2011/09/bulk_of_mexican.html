<h1>Bulk of Mexican Crimes Are Never Reported  &mdash;  Study</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Reuters, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>About 90 percent of Mexican victims of common crime last year never contacted police, citing bureaucratic delays and general mistrust of legal authorities who solve few cases, a study by Mexico&rsquo;s national statistics agency found.</p>
<p>Victims who went to the trouble of reporting crimes like robbery, extortion, car theft and break-ins to prosecutors faced a 35 percent chance there would be no investigation of their cases, the report released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>The independent statistics agency, known as Inegi, surveyed over 78,000 households across Mexico last year and found 15 percent of victims of unreported crimes said they had no faith in the authorities.</p>
<p>More than 33 percent said filing a complaint was too time-consuming, while more than 6 percent said they were discouraged by the hostile attitude of the police.</p>
<p>The tally did not include crimes associated with Mexico&rsquo;s drug violence and left out figures about drug trafficking, weapons possession and money laundering.</p>

		<p>Mexicans don&rsquo;t report other Mexicans. Blacks don&rsquo;t report other blacks. Asians the same. There are a few who do, but the majority do not.</p>
<p>It is only Whites who will report their own mother, if need be.</p>

		<p>Yet we are told that if police in the United States turn illegals over to ICE, they will be hesitant to report crimes.  I&rsquo;ve always wondered how they know that.  If they don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re illegal, how do they know if they are reporting crimes or not? Given their experiences in Mexico, they probably don&rsquo;t report crimes at all.   </p>

		<p>Mexican crimes deliberately UNDER-REPORTED? Of course. I mean WHY would Liberals want an unpleasant truth aired? Why would business owners and certainly our corporate giants want American citizens clamoring to seal the borders and clamp down hard on illegal immigration? Illegal immigrants, of course, being prominently visible in the courts and certainly, police stations throughout our country.</p>

		<p>The real reason why most people won&rsquo;t report crimes because they KNOW all too well that virtually all Mexican law enforcement agencies are (to some extent, at least!) infiltrated by organized crime. One of the main reasons why the Mexican drug cartels are (seemingly) all-powerful is because of the so-called &#8220;mordida&#8221; (bribe) system. During the years that Jose Lopez Portillo was Mexico&rsquo;s president, organized crime syndicates and drug traffickers enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth, profits and expansion  &mdash;  not surprisingly, their political and social influence grew enormously. In light of this, I can understand WHY many Mexicans are either afraid to report crimes to the police or feel that it&rsquo;s not going to do any good.</p>

		<p>That is happening in California on a mass scale. That is why Los Angeles now claims the crime rate is now the same as in the fifties! Oh yeah!<br/>
