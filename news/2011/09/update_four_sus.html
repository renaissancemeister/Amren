			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Wells and Todd Ruger, Herald-Tribune, September 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It started with a disputed call, followed by some disgruntled coaches throwing water bottles at the referees.</p>
<p>What happened next, captured on video and now being investigated by authorities, is shocking: more than a dozen youth football coaches and players attacking at least one referee, including a player in full gear except for his helmet flying into a referee and tackling him to the ground.</p>
<p>Felony charges could follow an investigation into what happened Saturday  &mdash;  and who did what  &mdash;  during the game between the age 13-14 junior teams of the Sarasota Gators and North Port Huskies played at Riverview High School.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The video speaks for itself,&#8221; Sarasota County Sheriff&rsquo;s Col. Steve Burns said. &#8220;It was disturbing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw adults, entrusted in a mentoring position with the youth of our community, acting and behaving in a manner that is absolutely unacceptable,&#8221; Burns said.</p>
<p>At the game, the video shows a coach or parent confronting a referee who was walking out of the end zone.</p>
<p>Punches were thrown between the two men, who started grappling, until a Gator player wearing the number 6 dives in and levels the referee. The boy then celebrates his hit on the official, the video shows.</p>
<p>As another referee tries to protect the referee on the ground, other Gators coaches, players and fans swarm the field, and one man appears to try to kick the grounded referee in the head.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attacking an athletic official is a felony in Florida.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Burns would not say if the player who tackled the referee would face charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, he&rsquo;s not getting a real good mentor from his role model, his coaching staff,&#8221; Burns said.</p>
<p>{snip} The age group involved in the incident caught on tape was 13- and 14-year-olds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>The referee who was assaulted by youth football coaches and players at a Saturday game told detectives he did not want to press charges.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>However, authorities can still decide to pursue battery charges without Ream and the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office has announced they have identified four suspects.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to a Sheriff&rsquo;s report, Ream says an unnamed suspect threw him to the ground.</p>
<p>The suspect, who said Ream was being unfair to his team, told deputies that Ream pushed him first.</p>
<p>Then a player in full gear, and presumably 13 or 14 years old, is seen in the video rushing through the field and tackling Ream.</p>

		<p>Note how the crowd went right after the white ref and left the black ref unscathed. Kudos to the black ref, though. He jumped right in to defend his colleague and, without having up close audio, I&rsquo;d guess endured at least a few &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221; taunts in the process.</p>

		<p>The fact is a 14 year old player is no longer considered an amateur but rather a scholarship in development to the professional leagues. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t help that college scouts are going to view all these kids from pee wee football to the last senior game. we need to get away from the avarice but  wont. </p>

		<p>Check out the size of those 13 and 14 year old &#8220;children&#8221;</p>
<p>Read the comments after the article on freerepublic.com.</p>
<p>Freerepublic did not post White race realist comments until very recently when the summer pack attacks on Whites began.</p>
<p>Suddenly the monitors are letting through all sorts of comments similiar to those posted on amren.  Lots of statistics of black on White crime and race statistics.  Percentage of blacks in the state and huge over representation of blacks in crime.</p>
<p>I have always thought freerepublic is a Republican Party front group.  If it is, it means the GOP is getting its shall we say manhood back and is recognizing its White base for the first time since Eisenhower violated Posse Commitus and sent federal troops to destroy the school system of Little Rock Ark.</p>

		<p>Folks can watch these videos but still assume &#8220;it can not happen to me&#8221;, or &#8220;those are just a bad bunch I will never run across&#8221;.<br/>
This is how a white liberal living in mostly white suburbs sees these reports - if they ever do see them.<br/>
What changes this, of course, is first hand experience.<br/>
The lesson may be that those around you, who are polite and civil<br/>
may harbor a resentment, or even hatred for you, and are just waiting for a chance to steal from you, or even hurt you, to settle a score having nothing to do with you, other than race.</p>

		<p>What I saw was a hate crime plain and simple. I saw a bunch of people of one race gang up on another. Don&rsquo;t tell me race was not involved. We all know what this is. Don&rsquo;t worry though Eric Holder won&rsquo;t do anything that &#8216;Demeans his people&rsquo;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;like enforcing the law.<br/>

<p>This is why we will continue to be victimized by blacks. There is no logical reason that this referee shouldn&rsquo;t press charges. If a black referee was attacked by White coaches and students, you can bet that hate crime charges would be filed, the coaches fired and the students disciplined along with &#8220;diversity&#8221; training and a ghetto lottery. </p>
<p>We also have these problems because a large % of Whites are obsessed with sports and idolize black athletes. They literally live for the next game. I have friends that are race realists but they turn to jellie when a black thug scores a touch down, it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re in a trance. No wonder their daughters start dating blacks and their sons act black, they see their parents cheering for them every week-end. These same people would have their hand on their gun if they saw this thug in a dark alley.</p>
<p>I hope blacks continue to beat down Whites at these games because these are the Whites that are unknowingly adding to the problem.    </p>

		<p>Quite similar to the flashmobs of &#8220;youths&#8221; attacking white people across this country. Right down to the attempt to kick the referee in the head. People like this referee, Ream, are part of the problem by not wanting to press charges. Blacks are not going to get the message that this behavior is unacceptable unless they are prosecuted, so I hope the authorities decide to press charges anyway. And did you see the size of these teenagers? They&rsquo;re the size of adults. Kicks and punches from them can do real damage. Since they are the size of adults, they should be charged as adults. As for this Ream guy, too bad he wasn&rsquo;t kicked in the head-it might have woke him up. Maybe.  </p>

		<p>In October 2009, in Rochester, NY,a (white) referee at a semi-pro was assaulted by a (black) player, who blind-sided him with a helmet to the face, breaking almost all of the bones, and causing permanent loss of smell, and other permanent injuries.   The referee, Peter McCabe, never saw it coming.  The &#8220;player&#8221; walked away, saying, &#8220;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m about.&#8221;  He was eventually convicted of assault, but that is poor comfort to Mr. McCabe, who will suffer for th rest of his life.</p>

		<p>I wholeheartedly agree with #2, Ed Ruffin. There must be enough video by now for someone to run together a two hour movie consisting of nothing but 10 second clips of black behavior in action. I&rsquo;d challenge any black apologist to find one  &mdash;  ONE  &mdash;  such equivalent clip of whites acting out for every hundred compiled.</p>
<p>Of course, we&rsquo;d then be told that the white technology that enables us to document black behavior is itself &#8220;RACISSS.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Bad calls, assuming such were made here, are part of any game.  I used to ref basketball games; I assume I made some bad calls.  If league officials do not act to suspend those responsible for the attack on these referees, I would hope that the league&rsquo;s entire referee corps walk out.  Note by the way, how &#8220;one man appears to try to kick the grounded referee in the head.&#8221;  Head shots have become de rigeur for black mobs. </p>

<p>Impulse control, childish, out-of-control anger, and just plain primitive, third world behavior, isn&rsquo;t just revealed by flash mob beatings and black on white beat downs, where black mobs set upon fewer or lone whites.  These pathologies are as much a part of blacks in any competition as they are within incidences of crime.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s typical behavior of primitives who have not yet reached the same level of evolution as the rest of the world.<br/>

<p>Exactly! Many of these White fans are so-called &#8220;conservatives&#8221; also. I quit watching football way back when more and more  blacks were enlisted. Their silly &#8220;dances&#8221; in the end zone and their arrogance left me cold. </p>
<p>But, what is more important is that the powers that be, wanted to put blacks in sports, Hollywood, TV, music, etc. for a REASON. Make them rich and famous so that the stupid White women would be more willing to &#8220;date&#8221; them and have their offspring.</p>
<p>Notice how it is that the White men are the ones supporting these teams and buying their junk and rooting for their &#8220;team&#8221;? In effect, they have willingly handed over their White women and daughters to the black man.  </p>

		<p>The media are once again liars and panderers. This was no &#8220;Brawl&#8221; is was a mob attack upon a lone referee. By calling it a brawl, suggests all were willing participants. The media knows exactly what  they report and why. They&rsquo;re not that dumb. </p>

		<p>Every day I see Africa coming into bloom in the USA. It is truly a different (and horrible) world today, totally alien from what I knew as a kid, a young adult, or even a thirty-something.<br/>
I can&rsquo;t really imagine this can go on much longer&hellip;Obama is finished. No real chance of re-election, Holder the racist clown will be gone.  We can at least be thankful that their pure racist, pure Marxist beliefs sank them. We hoped it would be so, and they show no signs of changing their course. <br/>
Whites can no longer ignore the scope of the hate crimes committed en masse, upon them. Even if they watch the MSM exclusively, they now know, and it has to be sinking in.<br/>
Self- segregation is on the rise, practically the order of the day.<br/>
But then I wonder&hellip;how did Americans (whites) react to the so- called Rodney King Riots?<br/>
The footage was run a lot on the MSM- something I think they would never do today.<br/>
(Remember those chimps blasting the white truck driver with a brick and hooting and doing inane victory dances)? That footage was as damning as it gets&hellip;but Americans (whites) forgot. They just let it all slide&hellip;<br/>
Yet today, it is more frequent, by a hundred times. Every day, more flash mobs. The schools are dead or dying, white parents increasingly keep kids out of schools going brown. <br/>
 Ghetto blacks have splattered across once safe and clean communities all over the USA, run out  of the inner cities by the Mestizos who obviously want to kill them. <br/>
I guess there is enough section 8 housing and various benefits in all the previously good medium sized towns? (Honestly, I don&rsquo;t know how they are surviving here in Colorado Springs). What is there for these inner city thugs to DO here? Sell drugs, I guess.<br/>
Scenes like on this video have to be making the final, clear impression upon whites.<br/>
I hope. I sure wish I had an answer for society at large, though; the problem is, now as whites must surely have had enough, blacks are living the next block over. Real thug types, the real deal. The countryside is the only place to go.  I can not see investing  in any city. Why? Blacks and Mestizos have either infected the place, or soon will. <br/>
So, I think we can all see now, but what is there to do about it? <br/>
Aside from vacating the cities (unavailable option to most), there is mini- apartheid, I guess&hellip;God it is a mess, but we will move forward, if only out of bitter necessity.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the level of decorum observable in Atlanta metro area courthouses. One miscreant is on trial for a crime allegedly perpetrated on another miscreant. Both have the courtroom packed with family and friends. Shouting, applause and other behavior befitting a prizefight, until the gallery is dismissed from the courtroom by the judge. Then a decision, possibly a verdict, or even a decision on a motion that incenses one side of the battle and its on! A rumble in a courtroom or corridor of the courthouse - as though a trial, and all the process and safeguards that go into it are a joke and it is simply our team versus their team. Fights break out more often than you would imagine. This is a segment of the population that sees the legal system as a sporting event (our team vs. their team), so it is hardly surprising that in an actual sporting event, something like this happens.</p>

		<p>Looks like a hate crime to me, a football game masquerading as a Beat Whitey event.</p>
<p><br/>
What I see is a pack of Leroy&rsquo;s and Tyrone&rsquo;s maybe a Malcolm X or two,attacking the only white referee on the field.</p>
<p>If I were the referee there I wouldn&rsquo;t be caught in that part of town again or I would buy some death by riot insurance.</p>

		<p>From the vid on Fox sure looked like holder&rsquo;s people, no surprise and very historical.</p>
<p>Back in the day of &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo;, we used to go watch the Holder&rsquo;s people high school football games and every one was just the same as this one. Helmets off used as clubs, coaches, fans and both teams out on the field NOT playing football, only thing missing were knives and guns.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s been suggested that Holder&rsquo;s holding of the AG office plays a big part in all of this. When the Philadelphia case from Election Day of 2008 was thrown out for no reason other than the criminals were &ldquo;Holder&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; it seemed as though there came about an immediate license for black people to do whatever they want.</p>

		<p>Obama losing isn&rsquo;t what it is going to be interesting about 2012 &hellip; it is how black people will respond to Obama losing in a landslide &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; and what is going to happen when it is all captured on video by smart phones and distributed around White America via Facebook, Twitter, WordPress, YouTube and other forms of social media?</p>
<p>For the first time in decades, White America will get to see the real Black America, totally unmediated. The only reason we are seeing this here is because of social media.</p>
<p>As recently as 2005, when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, YouTube and Facebook were non-existent. But now, we can see these events unmediated, draw our own conclusions, and talk about these things.</p>
<p>And so, when the &ldquo;flash mobs&rdquo; attempt to launch a revolution in the United States (they have already pulled this stunt in Britain), it will provoke a backlash in the U.S. the likes of which hasn&rsquo;t been seen in generations.</p>

		<p>This is a racial attack plain and simple. This team, its players and coaches MUST be banned from all sports but wont be. In our country one white fighting a african american is a racial crime. Ten african americans attacking a white is just urban crime and just the minorities rebelling against the repressive white society. Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Cleveland people better wake up.</p>

		<p>Way too many whites worship football and basketball. My white co workers are all either Raiders or 49ers fans and one of them asked me why we Indians refuse to get into American sports. I couldn&rsquo;t answer him because the answer was un-PC. We Indians are WAY too smart to worship these thug athletes. We encourage our kids to study the maths and sciences rather than joining the thug-ball teams.</p>

		<p>I just saw TV coverage of this shocking event today on CNN Headline News.   The most disgraceful part was that the white anchor and the white commentator made no reference to the racial angle whatsoever.   From the first frames of the video clip, I could clearly see that it was young blacks attacking a white referee yet the white guys at the desk were never going to mention this obvious fact.  If young blacks attacking a white man doesn&rsquo;t count as a &#8220;hate crime&#8221;, what does?<br/>

<p>White flight continues. They first moved to the suburbs from the city, now that the suburbs have section 8 housing, the whites are moving to the ex-burbs, and commuting longer distances. The suburbs are being destroyed. Even those suburbs who still have 90%+ white populations, for some reason, the public schools are being inundated with section 8 children, making the whites almost a minority. Now that suburban schools are almost gone, they are spilling out into the exburbs. The whites will have to move again&hellip;or perhaps we will start to collectively stand our ground? Section 8 housing is angrily defended by liberal politicians. Republican politicians are too spineless to say anything against it&hellip;Richard Nixon actually endorsed Section 8 housing. This system destroyed my home state of Massachusetts. Everyone could plainly see how communities were being destroyed&hellip;but for some reason, whites still continued voting for Ted Kennedy, Barney Frank, etc. White liberals collectively ignore black on white crime. Other whites vote democrat because they support unions and government hand-outs.  They ignore black on white crime because &#8220;republicans are evil and we need to vote for hand-outs&#8221;.  Basically whites mostly ignore the problem, and hope it goes away if they keep moving. </p>

<p>Steve Sailer has suggested that trial jurors don&rsquo;t actually sit in the courtroom during the live arguments and action, but that the trial be videotaped, the elements that one attorney objects to and the judge sustains are edited out, and that after the trial is done in the flesh and recorded, the jurors see the edited recorded version.  Sailer thinks it would save a lot of time and preclude a lot of mistrials.  I think that jurors in cases where there are ganged-up black or Hispanic defendants will benefit because the defendants and their ganged up friends who attend the court hearings will never see the jurors, and therefore, won&rsquo;t be able to exact revenge plots upon them if there is a guilty verdict.</p>
<p>Also, why do all these court hearings have to be open to the public?  Like you said, you&rsquo;re only begging for a mini gang war in some cases.</p>

		<p>This article takes me back to 1981, when I was officiating football in west Texas. One weekend I was the head referee (white hat) in a youth game involving an all-black team (both players and coaches). Some background info: traditional &#8220;dirty&#8221; teams try to pull stuff like beating the snap and clandestine jersey-tugging. This bunch took dirty play to the ultimate level   &mdash;   spearing, late hits, yanking face masks, blocks from behind, and every other major foul in the book. Their obvious goal was to wear the officials down by making them throw flags on nearly every play, then blame any loss on the &#8220;racist refs.&#8221; Well, with about two minutes left in this particular game one of these black kids was flagged for spearing at the 50-yeard line. Immediately the coaches (and the black fans in the stands, of course) went ballistic and launched a tirade full of profanities and racial slurs. I kept flagging the coaches for unsportsmanlike conduct until the ball was at the 5-yard line, at which point one of them sneered &#8220;Why don&rsquo;t you just give them a touchdown?&#8221; So I immediately did exactly that (guess he never read the section of the rule book which gives the referee that authority!), then told them I would forfeit the game to the opponents if any of them said another word. Since this gang of punks still had a two-touchdown lead, they amazingly shut up.</p>
<p>The truly sad thing about the whole thing was that this team was the most talented in the league. They could easily have won nearly all their games playing clean football. Now that 30 years have passed I occasionally wonder what became of those players who were coached to play dirty. Likely most of them are either dead or in prison   &mdash;   either way, the rest of the community would be far better off.</p>
<p>Now for 99% of white people this incident would be their racial awakening. Unfortunately I wrote it off as an aberration because: (a) there were very few blacks in my hometown and only one or two in my high school (none at all before that), and (b) I was in the USAF at the time and no one in the military, regardless of race, was allowed to act even remotely that barbaric. The awakening came six years later when I left the USAF; that&rsquo;s when I realized the decent blacks I&rsquo;d been working with while in uniform were the real aberrations.</p>

		<p>We Americans, that is traditional White Chistian America, must start to get united, for one of these days our enemies are going to come back and haunt us if we do not do anything about this.  We must organize quickly, strategically, and with allies.  The allies are those from traditional countries of our ancestries like Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Austria, and the Anglo Saxon countries primarily: New Zealand, Australia, Britain, Northern Ireland, South Africa (both Boers and Brits), and what&rsquo;s left of the Rhodesians, and Canada.  This is our jihad, as seriously believe massive violence along sectarian, religious, racial, and nationalistic lines will develop.  We must be prepared.  I think making overtures to friendly American Indian tribes would be useful as well, as many have white ancestry and pride themselves on it, such as the Cherokees, Navajos, Seminoles, Comanches, and other sophisticated tribes that are friendly to the US nationalist cause. The Apache, Arapaho, Apache, Sioux and Cheyenne need not apply as they do not like America or those tribes I have named. What are your thoughts, friends?</p>

		<p>A few observations:</p>
<p>1. We can&rsquo;t see much of the surrounding area, but the school (or recreation center) seems to heavily fenced and gated. The buildings have tiny windows; some walls have no windows. It looks like a prison.</p>
<p>2. The &#8220;kids&#8221; are huge. I know they are football players, but the white kids I know, even the football players, are not nearly that large - not at age 13-14.</p>
<p>3. The adults are dressed like hooligans. I know summer sporting events are casual affairs, but the black adults seem to dress like thugs deliberately.</p>
<p>4. Sarasota is only 15.6% black.</p>

		<p>This is Portland Oregon.  The school is 53 percent black.</p>
<p>As my brother always said; before you buy a house take a couple days and see the kind of kids in near by schools.</p>
<p><br/>
Mayor Sam Adams decried the gun violence that broke out again in Portland Friday night after the Jefferson High School football game and said Portland police are &#8220;out in full strength&#8221; to prevent any tit-for-tat shootings. </p>
<p>Six teenagers were wounded in the area of North Albina Avenue and Jessup Street around 11:20 p.m. The mother of one of the wounded youths said her son had been released from the hospital today, but the other five teens were still being treated. </p>

<p>I am a Christian but far from the &#8220;traditional&#8221; Christianity being preached from the mainstream churches of today. They would label me a &#8220;heretic&#8221;. I wish what you say could happen, but it won&rsquo;t. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p> The Christians of today would never fight for our race,(to them that would be racist and EVIL) they are told over and again that we are all the same, that Jesus loves &#8220;everybody&#8221; and came to &#8220;save&#8221; us all&#8221;, they say turn the other cheek, they promote interracial adoptions and marriages, they have become pacifists and diversity loving,. </p>
<p>The enemy infiltrated the Churches and seminaries a long long time ago. They had to get the churches first and foremost after &#8220;translating&#8221; the Bible in many ways that suited them for their agenda.  Since the 1611 Bible, (which is a very hard read) most translations are what I call blasphemy. They left some intact and omitted some and changed the meanings of some. Confusing? Yep.</p>
