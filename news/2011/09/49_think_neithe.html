			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rasmussen, September 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Voters are more convinced than ever that neither major political party in Washington, DC is on their side.</p>
<p>Now roughly one-out-of-two Likely U.S. Voters (49%) think it&rsquo;s fair to say neither party in Congress is the party of the American people, up six points from a year ago. A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 32% say it&rsquo;s not fair to characterize the two parties that way, while 18% are not sure. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ratings for the current Congress remain at their worst, with just six percent (6%) of voters who rate its performance as good or excellent. Sixty-six percent (66%) say Congress is doing a poor job, the highest negative rating since March 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Male voters believe more strongly than female voters that neither party in Congress is the party of the people. Whites are more than twice as likely as blacks to think that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>But then blacks are twice as likely as whites to think the Democratic Party has a plan for where it wants to take the nation. A plurality (49%) of white voters feel the Republican Party has a plan for the future, but 64% of black voters disagree.</p>

		<p>Both parties are controlled.  Just like the politicians.  We need to do away with political contributions like they did in Europe where each candidate gets a fixed amount from the government and that&rsquo;s it.  All treated the same.  No conflicts of interest or bribes allowed.</p>

		<p>On strictly economic grounds the race-replacement enthusiasts are liars. When America was largely labor self-sifficient after WWW2 up through 1973-the year the real wage began to stagnate-America achieved great things, and the real wage for millions of Native Born White Americans had an upward trajectory. The race-replacement enthusiasts would have us believe that a severe labor scarcity would be a terrible thing..this is a bold face-lie. Labor scarcities have always been a wonderfull thing for Native Born White Americans&hellip;single most important factor in raising the real wage and labor scarcities correspond precisely to those eras in American history when immigration was nearly completely shut off. The end of WWW2 to 1973,-an era of very low legal immigration and almost no white immigration-was called the Golden Age of economic growth by economists. You either support a high wage economy or a low wage economy. A labor scarcity always induces a significant upward pressure on the real wage. Republican and Democratic politicians always blather on as they read from their policy wonk sheets about the need for a high wage economy&hellip;Well..that&rsquo;s easy enough..shut all nonwhite immigration down to 0 and start the expulsion of all the post-1965 nonwhite fifth columns. But of course, Republican and Democratic politicians are sociopathic liars..the last thing in the world that they want is a high wage economy&hellip; both Republican and Democratic Politicians exist for no other reason than to secure high-fertility post-1965 scab labor for their sociopathic corporate paymasters&hellip;what they want is a low-wage slave labor economy for millions of Native Born White Americans:the intent is to maximize the scale of economic terror that millions of Native Born White Americans experience on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The Republican-Democratic low wage labor policy is the reason..is the force behind the rapid race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority with post-1965 high fertility nonwhite scab labor&hellip;treason is the reason.</p>
<p>Of course, the preservation of the Native Born White American population as a racial majority requires a policy of 0 legal and illegal immigration&hellip;to the extent that this would induce a severe labor scarcity..it would be a great thing for 1)the real wage,2)economic growth,3)technoogical innovation and protection of America&rsquo;s ecosytems and thousands of endangered species.</p>
<p>Although the race-replacement issue is absolutely the fundamental issue&hellip;the race-replacement issue is deeply interconnected with the economic and ecological crisis in America circa 20011.</p>
<p>The passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act should be renamed the 1965 Native Born White American Destruction Act.</p>

		<p>But the Republicans and Democrats do a very good job of representing the interests of that very large racially concious nation China and its highly racialized people. The Republicans and Democrats have allowed China to basically   extend its racial-geneline borders deep into America. Native Born White Americans died for,paid for, and built the California State University System..the greatest University system on the Planet. The Treasonous Republican and Democratic Parties ripped the California State University System away from the Native Born White California Majority-now a minority in California-and handed it over to China..China&rsquo;s youth are now the beneficiares of the billions of tax dollars invested by  Native Born White Americans in the building of California&rsquo;s University System. Without a doubt Treason is the Reason. The Chinese no longer have to engage in technological and Miltary espionage since in a few years they will effectively own California and all its educational,technological, military and natural resources.</p>

		<p>Well this is a no-brainer.  Congress represents their own best interest with the priority of getting re-elected, that&rsquo;s it.  None of those people have much of anything in common with the rank and file citizens of this country.  They are political elites who live lives of extreme privilege and shelter.   </p>

		<p>There is certainly no party that represents the interests of the white working class and middle class.  The Republicans are mainly interested in ensuring that multi-millionaires  don&rsquo;t have to pay higher taxes, while at the same time favoring endless wars and a burgeoning police state that cost huge amounts of tax dollars.  Apparently they hope to balance the budget by slashing Medicare.  That will go over real well with middle class Americans.</p>
<p>The Democrats worship at the altar of Diversity.  &#8220;Diversity&#8221; means fewer whites, which is why Democrats favor mass immigration and illegal immigration, even though the increase in population is not good for our environment nor is the steady influx of cheap labor good for the wages of American citizens.  The left has long since ceased to care about the environment or about decent wages for working Americans.  Diversity uber alles.  It is simply not possible for me to belong to the party of Al Sharpton.</p>

<p>Actually, the Republican party represents the rich.  The Democrats represent the super super rich and non Whites.</p>
<p>The White Democrats are the wealthiest of the wealthy.  Pritzker (Hyatt hotels) Annenbergs, Geffen, Teresa Heinz, George Soros, Mike Milken, all the super rich are Democrats.</p>
<p>Elections nowdays are Republican millionaries vs Democrat billionaries.  The Democrats usually win because they have millions of non White welfare dependents voting for them.</p>

<p>Good idea; or simply require all FCC regulated stations to give free and equal airtime to any and all candidates or face revocation of their license. Take note that &#8216;news&rsquo; outlets have &#8216;tingles running up their legs&rsquo; for whomever buys the most commercial airtime on their network -which only partly explains their obvious bias. <br>
We need to start using their own tactics against them; Al Sharpton for example is a blatant racist, and should be called out on the fact. Anyone who supports race based college admission policies is a vile, evil racist -pure and simple. To the liberal panderers, calling out their obvious racism is a good hard slap in their collective faces; the more so since they cannot deny the fact. <br>
Frankly, their racism against White people equates to a very serious mental problem; as the majority of these race pandering fools are white themselves (e.g. Tim Wise -who obviously needs a vacation someplace with soft furniture, soft carpet and particularly soft walls.)<br>
No, neither party represents Us anymore, and none will in the current climate. Hopefully, after the American post-mortum, there will be enough of us left to bring something good and righteous out of the ashes wrought by the two party cult of diversity.</p>

		<p>Most blacks won&rsquo;t condemn the Democrats as long as Obama leads the party.  When he no longer does, it will be interesting to see how well they continue to tolerate illegal Hispanics taking their neighborhoods and jobs and helping to overtake them as the most numerous American minority.  <br>
The biggest problem for the U.S. is now illegal immigration.  The Democrats want brown voters, and the Republicans want cheap labor, so both parties are leading us to doom.  Third parties don&rsquo;t work in this nation because too many people fail to vote.  The best hope is probably that some candidate in the GOP goes against the grain and staunchly opposes illegal immigration.  Of course, there&rsquo;s a big gap between saying and doing.</p>

		<p>Richard Spencer argued a week ago on vdare.com that the Republican Party is effectively the White American Party. Certaintly, there is the obvious evidence for this claim. But this analysis leaves out some very important facts about the Republican Party..the most important being that the Republican Party is owned by the psychopathic Corporations. If there is going to be an Alternative Right Republican Party that breaks away from the Repubican Party it can not accept one penny from any Corporation. The Alternative Right political vision has to be one in which the Corporations have to be stripped of all legal standing in the courts&hellip;for otherwise they will continue to rule America as  supra-human demigods with life and death power over millions of Native Born White Americans..consider this as part of a Native Born White American Patriot Manifesto.</p>
<p>Native Born White American racial survival requires a hyper-level of civic vigilence. Ron Paul will not save Native Born White American. If eleceted, Ron Paul will use the power and violence of the State to enforce his race-replacement agenda&hellip;you have been warned.  More generally, no one who aspires to President of the &#8220;United States&#8221; should be trusted with that much power. I am really shocked at the childlike naivete of the Ron Paul supporters.</p>

The problem is that we no longer have what our Founding Fathers envisioned; automouis states.</p>
<p>If we were living by the founding principles, we would have conservative states (red) and liberal states (blue) and everyone would gravitate to the state that expoused their philosophy.</p>
<p>What we have instead are purple states, some redder or bluer than others.</p>
<p>There can never be a true conservative state because liberals in conservative states will drives policies to make states more liberal.</p>
<p>Conservatives aren&rsquo;t free to live in conservative states and liberals aren&rsquo;t free to live in liberal states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder no one is happy.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly so.  But, they are not sociopathic liars, they know exactly what they are doing.  Pols in neither party work for the voters, they work in the interests of their largest donors; are essentially bought and paid for by the highest bidder.</p>

<p><i>The passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act should be renamed the 1965 Native Born White American Destruction Act.</i></p>
<p>I prefer &#8220;Genocide&#8221;, but &#8220;Destruction&#8221; will do.  Look at who sponsored, wrote and shoved through the 1965 Hart-Celler Act, and at who bought, bribed or threatened Ted Kennedy.  You&rsquo;ll find answers there too, the real enemy of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>Ted Kennedy played the role of useful idiot:</p>
<p>&#8220;First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually&hellip; Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset&hellip;. [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia&hellip;. &hellip;. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.&#8221;</p>

The immortal head of this Hydra must be found and cut off, only then will genocide against whites be halted.</p>

		<p>After I saw a headline article over on www.americanpatrol.com that reported that Mitt Romney promised to &#8216;stop illegal immigration&rsquo;, but when I read the full story - he went on to say that he &#8216;loved legal immigration&rsquo;, I decided to pick up the phone and call the toll-free D.C. office for my district Congressman.</p>
<p>After one of his office flunkies came on the line, I cited the article and said that I agreed 100 percent with the idea of stopping all illegal immigration.  But, I added, I also did not approve of Romney&rsquo;s statement that he loved &#8216;legal immigration&rsquo; - and I then went on to explain that the White European descendants of the Founding Stock of this nation had legitimate ethnic interests and those interests were not going to be served if Romney or any other politician opened our borders to the non-European third world and allowed hundreds of millions of non-whites to flood into America, thereby reducing Whites to a minority inside their own nation. </p>
<p>I patiently tried to explain to the dunce that I had on the line a few simple facts that he should have learned in 8th grade math class, had he not dozed through the entire school year.  Such as: being a numerical minority means that you are subjugated to the whims and agendas of whichever ethnic group is now the &#8216;new&rsquo; majority. Examples:  85-100% tax rates.   The abolition of the sacred and precious Constitution and Bill of Rights, which were gifts to the White European posterity of our 100 percent White Founding Fathers.  Even more draconian anti-white discriminatory affirmative action laws, imposed by the new non-white majority and used to further disenfranchise the former White majority.  The list is endless.  I told the dunce I had on the phone that being reduced to a minority, whether it was due to massive ILLEGAL immigration of non-whites or by massive LEGAL immigration of non-whites with the blessing of our race traitorous white elites - it all spelled the same thing in the end.  Namely, the destruction of the dominant culture. The obliteration of all social cohesion.   The destruction of White Western civilization. The loss of the ability of White Europeans to control the destiny of the nation of their ancestors and to surrender control over the destiny and future of their children and grandchildren to other ethnic groups who did not have the best interests of White Europeans in their minds. </p>
<p>What was the attitude and general response from the dunce I had on the line?    I&rsquo;d describe it as impatience - and also an attitude of disinterest, and this idiot couldn&rsquo;t wait to get me off the phone.   And, this was a REPUBLICAN Congressman&rsquo;s office, friends.     This arrogant, elitist snob of an IQ challenged moron was not in the least bit concerned with ANY of my very legitimate and common sense arguments!   I even cited the former Rhodesia as one prime example of what happens when whites allow themselves to be ruled by non-whites - the murders, the gang rapes, the bloody mutilations, and outright theft of the property of the White South Afrikaners - and I got the impression that this arrogant, elitist snob was struggling to stifle a yawn as I described the situation in post-white ruled Rhodesia and predicted that we would be seeing the same thing here in America, if idiots like Romney and Perry continued to support massive non-white invasions of America.  Disinterest.   Apathy.    Zero sense of alarm or appreciation for any of my valid concerns.</p>
<p>Well, here is a message to all of my fellow White race realists and AR community loyalists.   We must promise to ourselves that we will remember the treason of our white ruling elites who are destroying the future for our children and grandchildren.   And, when the time comes whereby this decomposing dung heap of a once great nation finally breaks apart and we obtain our much deserved White ethno-state - the time for these treasonous white elites to be awarded their just punishment will also arrive, and we must not falter or allow ourselves to be overcome with any misplaced sense of mercy or sympathy when this moment arrives.</p>
<p>We must vow to nip white race treason in the bud and do so in a public fashion that leaves a sober impression on our fellow people that will never be forgotten.   Treason against one&rsquo;s own tribe must be made again into the most horrific and unforgivable crime that anyone can ever commit - and the punishment for it should be ruthless.  </p>

		<p>Many years ago (I didn&rsquo;t bother to keep track), two things happened that affected elections. </p>
<p>One was to limit campaign contributions to keep &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; from controlling elections. However, the fat cats always have ways to give candidates money (e.g., lucrative book contracts, speaking tours, PACs) so it only limited third party candidates. </p>
<p>The other was to have candidates more dependent on primaries instead of &ldquo;smoke filled rooms&rdquo;.  This, of course, put the selection of candidates in the hands of the mainstream media (who can give favorable coverage without it being considered a campaign contribution).</p>
<p>Like a few others here, I support Ron Paul. But I am sure that if the msm fail to do him in, the CIA will take him out.</p>
<p>P.S. Another campaign &ldquo;reform&rdquo; was to keep lists of donors so we can find out how someone is voting by looking at the campaign contributions on Huffington Post:</p>
<p><a href="https://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/" rel="nofollow">https://fundrace.huffingtonpost.com/</a></p>
<p>As my grandfather once told me, there is no such thing as a secret ballot (he was a Chicago politician a long time ago). <br>
[BTW, he also told me that he once turned down an offer to send voting machines to his district because he was afraid that they would come programmed for him to receive more votes than there were voters in his district &mdash; he was a Democrat, of course.]</p>

		<p>Hi Luke, thanks very much for your efforts. I wish more people would call our &#8220;representatives&#8221;. If he were a democrat, the office would have either hung up on you or attacked you in some way. Attacks range from verbal, to professional, to financial. In the past, if a Massachusetts state citizen wrote a letter to Ted Kennedy, even hinting at criticism, you would be brutally audited by the IRS.  A letter or call such as yours would get you fired from your current job as well. Keep calling the Republicans. They are quite spineless, but they are  a good start. Enough calls and protest will eventually cause change.The Democrats will use such a call to single you out and destroy your life. </p>

<p>Since you are waxing so generally mythological about a very specific problem, I suggest that the monster is a Medusa with many snakes of deceit for hair.  The vast unorganized organizations that are moving against white America and the West in general are only united by a vague set of extremes of Western ideals that have become pathological.  So much so that they don&rsquo;t realize that they are ordering their own deaths.  Those who know who they are and manage to survive will be the victors.</p>

&#8220;Many years ago (I didn&rsquo;t bother to keep track), two things happened that affected elections. </p>
<p>The other was to have candidates more dependent on primaries instead of &ldquo;smoke filled rooms&rdquo;. This, of course, put the selection of candidates in the hands of the mainstream media (who can give favorable coverage without it being considered a campaign contribution).&#8221;</p>
<p>The primary thing was created by a commie front non profit called Common Cause.  It was founded and funded by the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations. I wonder what the had in mind.</p>
<p>Cui bono?  The fat cats who could buy TV time and hire advertising firms to get their candidates in office.<br>

		<p>Perhaps IQ distribution explains why the number is only 49%. </p>
<p><br>
Unless you have a dead kid on your hands, and some politician thinks it might be worth a photo-op the odds are you are going to need to shell out for a lobbyist, and significant campaign contributions to get any traction with anything you want done. That works for large companies, but it leaves John Q. Public out to pasture, and its intended to. </p>

The problem is that we no longer have what our Founding Fathers envisioned; automouis states.</p>
<p>If we were living by the founding principles, we would have conservative states (red) and liberal states (blue) and everyone would gravitate to the state that expoused their philosophy.</p>
<p>What we have instead are purple states, some redder or bluer than others.</p>
<p>There can never be a true conservative state because liberals in conservative states will drives policies to make states more liberal.</p>
<p>Conservatives aren&rsquo;t free to live in conservative states and liberals aren&rsquo;t free to live in liberal states.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder no one is happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm, my experience is that very few people actually share the same outlook on everything.  So we would have to have 350 (or is it 315) million different states.  I concluded some time ago that one reason America is failing is that the notion of individualism has gone to such an extreme that no one can be relied on to support anyone else, unless it is in their own personal interest.  There is no compromise for the better of the whole, or group, unless it will benefit the individual personally.  Along with that is the type of pathological individualism that nearly guarantees non-cooperation due to ego challenges.  </p>

		<p>There are better reasons for voting against the Democrats, than for the Republicans.<br>
  <br>
The Republican Party increases the wealth and power of a preditary oligarchy that enriches itself by cutting pay rolls and pay checks of our once thriving middle class.   </p>

		<p>None of them have a bad thing to say about quotas. Reagan actually extended them to Hindus and Hasidic Jews (the two richest groups in the country) and appointed the vile Sandra Day as a favor to his feminist daughter. Then there was his amnesty for illegals which spurred the current flood. And he was a right-winger? It&rsquo;s been this way for decades. Nixon was actually a huge lib who created many of the alphabet soup agencies which plague us today. The Bushes did nothing about the border in their 12 years. They are grooming the half-Mexican nephew for the oval office. He&rsquo;s already giving speeches about &#8220;his people&#8221;.</p>
<p>I may well vote for Obungle and hope for a coup/revolution/civil war.</p>
