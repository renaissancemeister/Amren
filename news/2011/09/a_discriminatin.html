<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Breast cancer unites women of all color and creed under a common banner of hope. But not all breasts are created equal.</p>
<p>Different minority populations, as well as subgroups within those populations, face distinct challenges and risk factors when it comes to breast health.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
<strong>African-Americans</strong></p>
<p>Though Caucasians have the highest incidence of breast cancer overall, African-American women have the highest rates of pre-menopausal breast cancer and are more likely to die from the disease at any age.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic status and inadequate access to quality health care are partly to blame for higher morbidity among black women, but genes also play an important role, especially in the younger set, [Dr. Lovell] Jones said.</p>
<p>African-American women are more than twice as likely as white women to be diagnosed with early-onset, virulent tumors called triple-negatives, so named because they are not fueled by estrogen, progesterone or the HER2neu protein and therefore do not respond to current therapies that block or eliminate those hormones. Women in West Africa are similarly afflicted, Jones said.</p>
<p>Triple-negatives can be removed through surgery if caught early. Trouble is, young women and African-American women tend to have particularly dense breast tissue, making it hard for even a mammogram to catch some tumors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Asians and Pacific Islanders</strong></p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest rates of breast cancer and morbidity of all the ethnic groups in the U.S. But those statistics are dangerously misleading because they can give Asian women a false sense of security, said Scarlett Lin Gomez, research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California. The subpopulations tell a very different story.</p>
<p>Women of Japanese descent have as high a breast cancer rate as white women, perhaps because they&rsquo;ve been in the U.S. longest and are exposed to the same environmental and lifestyle risks, Gomez said. Filipina women have the lowest five-year survival rate of any other ethnic group, for reasons unknown.</p>
<p>American-born Asians and immigrants living in the U.S. for a while get breast cancer up to 50 percent more frequently than their counterparts living in Asian countries, likely because of childbearing practices and more sedentary lifestyle, Lin Gomez said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><br>
<strong>Latinas<br>
</strong><br>
For Latinas, their lower rate of breast cancer incidence and mortality could be due to earlier age of first pregnancy and greater likelihood of breast-feeding, plus less use of post-menopausal hormone drugs, Thompson said.</p>
<p>But Latinas are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to be diagnosed at a younger age and with worse tumors  &mdash;  even with equal health care access, studies have shown, suggesting a genetic component.</p>
<p>Hispanic women are more likely to have genetic mutations of the BRCA1 gene, which increases a woman&rsquo;s chance of getting breast cancer in her lifetime, than whites, blacks or Asians, studies have shown. The Hispanic women in one study tended to carry the same mutation as the population most afflicted with BRCA1 gene mutation, Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern European origin.</p>

		<p>In the case of black women it may be due to the brassiere, a Western invention.  The traditional African breast swings low like a sweet chariot, freely waving in the wind, like the natural grass on the African savannah.  I think it is probably high time that someone brought a charge of attempted genocide of black women before the US Supreme Court.  Obviously, this is the reason for these high rates of breast cancer among black women.  It&rsquo;s a clear case of racism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asian and Pacific Islander women have the lowest rates of breast cancer&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
But then of course they also have the lowest rates of breasts.</p>

		<p>Not to be sarcastic, but are these scientists implying that breast size leads to higher cancer deaths? </p>
<p>After all, blacks (highest risk) usually have the largest breasts while Orientals (lowest risk) have the smallest.</p>

		<p>1. Breast cancer affects men too.<br>
2. When you find a cure for breast cancer, guess what, you found a CURE for CANCER!<br>
3. Find a cure for one cancer, you&rsquo;ll have your cure for all cancers.<br>
4. Other than milk, breasts are mostly a socially praised vanity of women. Thank you Snooki.<br>
5. Testicular cancer can kill too, you know.</p>
