			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Kingstone and Zoe Conway, BBC, September 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics make up the fastest growing segment of the American population, but are lagging when it comes to education. The consequences are huge not just for individual families, but the entire American economy.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama said last year that Hispanic school children faced &#8220;challenges of monumental proportions&#8221;. He was articulating what many in the United States have been worrying about for years  &mdash;  that Latinos  &mdash;  from kindergarten to university  &mdash;  are falling far behind.</p>
<p>A White House report published in April states that less than 50% of Latino children are enrolled in pre-school; just 50% earn their high school diploma on time and, those who do are only half as likely as their peers to be prepared for college. Just 13% have a degree.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Democracy in peril&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>These percentages are troubling enough. What makes them truly alarming is the addition of another set of numbers  &mdash;  the demographics of Hispanic America. For they are the youngest and fastest growing group in the country. They make up 16% of the population now and will account for 29% of the population by 2050.</p>
<p>The issue has essentially reached a tipping point. It&rsquo;s harder to ignore the problems facing a minority group when they affect a third of the population. And there are economic reasons to care. How well Hispanic school children master their ABCs today will help determine the GDP of tomorrow.</p>
<p>At present, America can boast the best educated workforce in the world but in 50 years&rsquo; time, the majority of those workers will be Hispanic. If they are uneducated, what hope is there for American global competitiveness?</p>
<p>There are also fears about how poor educational outcomes could lead to greater inequality in America. In a 2009 book, The Latino Education Crisis, professors of education Patricia Gandara and Frances Contreras warn that: &#8220;Latino students today perform academically at levels that will consign them to live as members of a permanent underclass &hellip;  their situation is projected to worsen over time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, they write: &#8220;If their situation is not reversed, democracy is in peril.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Unique problems<br>
</strong><br>
Many of the problems facing Hispanics affect all minority groups  &mdash;  for example the difficulty of accessing high-quality schooling. But there are problems unique to this group. Consider the language barrier  &mdash;  four million Latino children struggle in class because they are still learning English, even though three quarters of them were born in the United States.</p>
<p>Hispanic mothers have far less education than their counterparts in other ethnic groups. According to Professors Gandara and Contreras, formal education is not as much of a priority in Latin America as it is in the US, so the parents may not be pushing their children to succeed or may feel intimidated by the school system.</p>
<p>Dr Veronica Garcia: &#8220;It is critical that we as Americans wake up and let our politicians know that this achieve gap is not OK&#8221;</p>
<p>There is also the issue of immigration status. On average one million legal immigrants have been admitted to the US each year since 1990, while roughly 500,000 have come illegally or overstayed their visas. According to the Census bureau, 50% of immigrants are from Latin America.</p>
<p>Undocumented children and the US-born children of undocumented parents can be at a disadvantage because their parents may be reluctant to access the full range of support services available for their children.</p>
<p><strong>Failed dreams</strong></p>
<p>President Obama tried and failed in 2010 to pass the Dream Act  &mdash;  a law that would give undocumented Latino students, brought to the US as children, the right to US citizenship so they can attend University.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not just a Latino problem; this is an American problem. We&rsquo;ve got to solve it because if we allow these trends to continue, it won&rsquo;t just be one community that falls behind  &mdash;  we will all fall behind together,&#8221; says President Obama.</p>
<p>The law is opposed by those who think that such an amnesty encourages illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Some states are working towards their own version of the Dream Act. The California state legislature passed a bill offering state-sponsored financial aid to non-resident students who attended state high schools for at least three years. The bill is currently awaiting the signature from the governor.</p>
<p>Governor Susana Martinez: &#8220;We cannot concentrate on one race and not another&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas governor Rick Perry, who allowed children of illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at Texas&rsquo;s state universities, now finds that position under attack as he runs for President.</p>
<p>There is much debate among politicians and policy makers about whether Hispanic children should get special attention or whether they should be treated like any other low income group in terms of educational inequity.</p>
<p>Whichever way that particular debate shakes out one thing is for certain  &mdash;  the political power of Hispanics is rising. Politicians cannot afford to ignore these challenges much longer.</p>

<p>You mean democracy isn&rsquo;t in peril already? Not since Brown v Board? Not since March 2, 1867? Only in peril unless we &#8220;do more&#8221; to accommodate illegals and their illegal citizen anchor babies?  </p>
<p>We allow non English speaking third world invaders to be measured against English first language first world citizens, and then when they don&rsquo;t equal us in outcomes, we are told to worry that they are &#8220;lagging behind&#8221;?  We&rsquo;ve learned that lessons enough times with the White-black achievement gap that we&rsquo;ve finally figured out what Thomas Dixon meant when he called the Freedmen &#8220;impossibilities&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only thing lagging behind is my concern for anyone who isn&rsquo;t a member in good standing within the family of White Humanity?</p>
<p>Requirements of good standing are 1. preserve and protect White privilege, 2. defy and resist diversity.</p>
<p><br>
What do you think will happen when anchor babies of illegal aliens are on the ballots, are elected to office, and then make laws that hurt White Americans through high taxes, low services, and corruption?  Whites will be faced with a hard choice.  Do we just submit and agree that it is all for the better because our suffering if just a step in the right direction toward atoning for our racist White privilege and systemic hate that kept us in power for too long? Or will White finally reach White Enlightenment and fight back against those who stole our country from us, including their enablers?  </p>
<p>I despair that White Humanity won&rsquo;t make the right decision, because it has done nothing but prepare itself for slavery ever since the end of WWII.  A race that would fight back against what is coming isn&rsquo;t a race that would have allowed itself to be so weakened, demoralized, and victimized.<br>

		<p>Not mentioned is the watering down of current education for children in the classrooms with the hispanics. </p>
<p>Catering to the influx of hispanic children who live in an atmosphere at home where there parents refuse to speak english which sends the message to these kids that english is not important.</p>
<p>This compromises the classroom because the teachers need to bend over backwards to try to get some peformance from the non english speaking children.</p>
<p>So in forty years there will be a nation of stupid people.</p>
<p>Thank you La Raza (your long term plan is working 100%).</p>

		<p>- &#8220;This is not just a Latino problem; this is an American problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would disagree with the first part of this statement, but agree with the second: It appears to be normal for the majority in the Latino community to &#8220;graduate&#8221; High School with an 8th grade education.  If that is the norm, then it cannot be a problem per se.  Within their own nation, they will develop to a point where they live within the bounds of their educational limits, attaining whatever that lifestyle may be. It only becomes a problem for Americans when we bring Latinos into our nation with the expectation that they magically become similar to educationally high-achieving Whites.  I don&rsquo;t recall the Hispanic levels of education being a crisis for America or Americans when the Hispanics remained OUT of the United States.  Hence, and again, the problem isn&rsquo;t with low levels of Hispanic learning, it is with Hispanics being here in the first place.</p>
<p>And to be certain, I would not want Hispanics here even if they had higher levels of education than all other ethnic groups.</p>

<p>I take issue with the preceeding assertion. I know that &#8220;educated&#8221; and &#8220;best educated&#8221; are editorial value judgements at best, but I have observed and interacted with many people from a wide variety of nations and socio-economic status backgrounds (both in the old country and with a new socio-ecomomic status in the new country) Most are far brighter than the average blue collar homegrown Miller Lite drinking stiff in Amerika.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Hispanic school children faced &ldquo;challenges of monumental proportions&rdquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>But why?  All it takes is one family to encourage one child to read, write, learn math, and enjoy learning in general.</p>
<p>Then repeat a few million times.  Easy peasy, right?  Why is that a &#8220;monumental challenge&#8221;?</p>

<p>I agree with this last sentence.  Place the military on the U.S. border; aggressively deport all illegal aliens (including those with U.S. born children); end birthright citizenship; make English the national language; and make U.S. immigration laws the most stringent in the world.  Urgent action is needed to reduce the projected number of Hispanics in the U.S.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&hellip;but in 50 years&rsquo; time, the majority of those workers will be Hispanic. If they are uneducated, what hope is there for American global competitiveness?&#8221;</p>
<p>  &mdash;    &mdash;    That is precisely why so many of us see a very, very dim future for our nation and our grandkids, because this will NOT be corrected, because there is no solution.</p>
<p>Amerindian peasants are at the bottom rung in all latin american societies - for a reason.  (Bad cultural habits, low IQ, low value for education, whatever you want to focus on.)</p>
<p>Latin America is exporting its ineducables and permanent underclass to us, and we won&rsquo;t do any better because after 150 years of trying to educate blacks, how far have we gotten?  (Wildings and violent flash mobs!)</p>
<p>I work with latino teenagers as part of my job assignment.  Almost all of them are very nice people, but the majority are none too bright.  The basic rule with latinos that I have found to be very constant is that the whiter they are, the more capable they are (and then vice versa!)</p>
<p>America has no future 50 years from now.</p>

<p>My graduate school was loaded with people who don&rsquo;t speak English in the home; many who didn&rsquo;t even arrive in the U.S. until their teens.  These were people from primarily Korea, China, and Eastern Europe.  The language barrier didn&rsquo;t seem to slow them down any.  The problem with the Mestizos isn&rsquo;t their language; which is much closer to English than that of the former groups I described, but with their aptitude and desire to learn.  It&rsquo;s just not there, and no amount of ESL will turn lead into gold.  And once implanted here, we are stuck with them and their descendants forever or until the U.S. finally collapses.  Wait until the second generation hits puberty en mass, then you&rsquo;ll see the real cost of those tomatoes.  </p>

		<p>Of course, the costs for the vain attempt to bring up the educational test scores for the even increasing numbers of hispanic children are not to be found in our technically bankrupt nation.  Although, they are probably thinking of more ways to transfer wealth from the white, middle class to pay for it.</p>
<p>The article states: &#8220;Later, they write: &ldquo;If their situation is not reversed, democracy is in peril.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, democracy is imperiled whenever you have the influx of a third world demographic group.  People who are emigrating from dysfunctional nations that are dysfunctional because of those people who inhabit it.  There is no magic pixie dust that is going to transform them when they cross the borders of a first world nation.</p>

		<p>We are still at square one with black problems and this country is letting in even a larger underclass.  It is a good way to destroy a country without firing a shot.  How about getting back to the fundamental issue that there are racial genetic differences between the races?  No matter how much money is thrown at inferior genes, not going to change a thing.  This has reached the tipping point alright.  The blacks are in big trouble too, no more gravy train full of white tax dollars thrown at them to be wasted.</p>

		<p>There a legal principle that states that no one can legally benefit directly or indirectly from a criminal act. This is reflected in many laws concerning retention of stolen property, even if acquiring the property was obtained without any illegality. Another example is a murderer prohibited from  inheriting from the victim&rsquo;s estate</p>
<p>This certainly fits the situation where the children of illegal immigrants gain benefits from being born in the U.S. You would think this would be obvious to a graduate from a prestigious law school.</p>

		<p>Leave it to the BBC to come up with this type of handwringing.</p>
<p>So when the last huge wave of immigrants came into the US back in the early 20th century, from western and eastern European countries, all speaking different languages, the state and federal governments bent over backwards to educate them all the way through university?  NO!  Through hard work, discipline, priorities, and 2 parent families being the vast majority of these people, children of these immigrants successfully integrated into society and eventually educated themselves.  Their children&rsquo;s children became the university students of the middle and later 20th century.  Worked pretty damned well too, because they mostly did it on their own. WITHOUT all the too numerous to count federal and state programs to take advantage of, as the hispanics currently have.  If they can&rsquo;t succeed with all the assistance thrown at them, then they can&rsquo;t succeed, period.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;They make up 16% of the population now and will account for 29% of the population by 2050.:</p>
<p>Instead of projecting what these distorters of the truth regard as future demographcs almost half a century ahead, they would be more useful if they concentrated on the changing mood of the country which reflects a growing animosity between the various tribes here and projecting what kind of situation is in store for the country in the NEAR future.  If they did that, they would be hard-pressed to deny that we have some serious civil upheaval looming just ahead.</p>
<p>But, obviously, they don&rsquo;t want to be useful, they want to make whites believe it is futile to fight for more homogenity and less immigration, because the country&rsquo;s march towards a rainbow utopia is irreversible.</p>
<p>But there won&rsquo;t be a utopia here anymore than there was in any empire throughout history.  However, there will be big changes and all of them will come about through large scale, massive civil strife.</p>
<p>When that happens, the perverters of the truth will have to find something else to lie about.</p>

		<p>I live in a community that&rsquo;s mixed; Hispanic, Vietnamese, and White. Almost no Blacks. Crime rate is surprisingly low and the crimes that do occur are usually Hispanic on Hispanic. Hispanics generally DON&rsquo;T randomly act innocent whites on the street for no reason.</p>
<p>Socially, people segregate but in the workplace, they are civil to each other. My observations: Hispanics are slow, but generally docile. The first generation doesn&rsquo;t learn English but they do follow orders when given to them in Spanish. The second generation usually speaks English well enough to function and sometimes will even talk to their Spanish speaking peers in English but they still are slow and lack the higher level skills.</p>
<p>Vietnamese are very bright and are able to learn abstract concepts quickly; those who come here as adults pick up English quickly although they always have an accent. The second generation of Vietnamese are dominant in English and have virtually no accent.  </p>
<p>The region of the U.S. that I live in is far more livable than any black ghetto and has a lower crime rate than all-white neighborhoods that are in close proximity to Black ghettos. The nearest Black neighborhood is over 60 miles from where I live.</p>
<p>For those of you in regions that only know black and white, I&rsquo;d like to let you know that Hispanics are far more civilized even though their IQs are lower than whites.</p>

		<p>We in the USA need to be reminded that the Asian hegemony, now in late formation stage, is likely to have cultural effects on us. Beneficial changes, maybe; but we would have to contain the dissenters who would contest meritocratic, non-PC ideals. Insofar as they are racially unified and successful, their example will not be lost on conservative opinion leaders here. Also, lest there are those who still doubt they will rise in distinction to us, it should be noted that given their population base IQ and its size, there are 215 million Chinese people in the gifted and talented range vs 21 million here. Think of the number of engineers, scientists, teachers and entrepreneurs those numbers translate into.</p>

		<p>It is long past time to severely limit legal Hispanic immigration, stop illegal immigration and begin the extended process of removing illegal residents by deportation.  So doing will limit the eventual Hispanic demographic to perhaps one fifth, maximum, not one third.</p>
<p>Funny how the achievement gap of both Hispanics and blacks is discussed ad infinitum without ever mentioning the IQ gap of those populations.  Hispanics in the USA have a documented IQ of 90 +/- 1 that has been stable over perhaps four generations.  Scholastic achievement correlates very well with IQ and no one knows how to honestly eliminate either &#8216;gap&rsquo;!</p>
<p>The 1965 Celler-Hart monstrosity of an immigration bill has the USA well on our way to third world status by importing an excess of such populations.</p>

		<p>Another thing that is overlooked is that white Americans also are educationally underdeveloped, with the specific exceptions of Jews (and not all), the children of Eastern European immigrants (again not all), and the hereditary upper middle class.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there is room for improvement among minority groups even so. But any effort to increase the education level of American society must necessarily focus on whites or it will fail.</p>
<p>The myth of American social mobility is that people come here, suffer the travails of the immigrant experience and the melting pot, reach the top, and stay there. But not so. Those have been here the longest are the worst off, except for those who are able to make specific arrangements to maintain their station, i.e create hereditary privilege.</p>

		<p>&#8220;four million Latino children struggle in class because they are still learning English, even though three quarters of them were born in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since it is now possible to lead a somewhat normal life in the U.S. without being able to speak English, there is no real NEED to learn English. Most of those folks can get by quite well without speaking a word of English and see themselves as being just as it should be. And the pride factor is at work too. The perception is that by being more fluent and proficient at English somehow you are letting down &#8220;your&#8221; people. There is among these folks a contemptuous attitude toward whitey and whitey English.</p>

		<p>My wife and I will be retiring soon. Some all-white island in Canada sounds good. I need to retire to a place that will afford me some relief from the steady cultural degeneration I&rsquo;ve witnessed over the course of my life. Some of my earliest memories are of the Apollo missions to the moon. Since then, the USA has been declining. I&rsquo;ve been watching this slow train wreck for forty years now. I warned people and even started a conservative quaterly journal that I kept alive for a few years. I did what I could.

<p>Yes, true, but they&rsquo;re not as peaceful and quiet as most Whites would wish. There are always exceptions, yes, but as they increase in number the noise   &mdash;   their &#8220;vibrant&#8221; and cheery mariachi music (as my folks call it) blares all morning, afternoon, and most nights, and even most of the night on the weekends.</p>
<p>My parents&rsquo; home is slowly becoming surrounded with such wonderful diversity. No&hellip; no crimes to speak of yet, but the noise pollution is real. And they never seem to sleep because the lights are always on, cars are always coming and going and HONKING all through the night, with the music blaring, or at least sub-woofing, out. Their houses are full and they apparently work and sleep in shifts, so there seems to never be any &#8220;quieting down,&#8221; never any real peace and quiet.</p>
<p>I know there are inconsiderate Whites who also see no problem with sharing their wretched taste in music with everyone around, but it&rsquo;s still not as constant as what I&rsquo;ve tasted and heard reported.</p>
<p>I will admit that if I absolutely had to choose one or the other, I would choose a hispanic-laced environment over a black one. However, there is all the &#8220;diversity&#8221; within the White peoples to satisfy me for the rest of my life.</p>

&#8220;As long ago as 1986, Japanese Prime Minister, Nakasone, stated that in the long-term the USA was doomed due to the impending preponderance of blacks and hispanics in the American population of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
I recollect the comment was made prior to 1986, and the quote was something along the lines of, &#8220;The trouble with the American educational system is that there are too many blacks, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans&#8221;. The Japanese Prime Minister was offering what he thought was a helpful, objective assessment of the issue. What a firestorm he created here. Jesse Jackson was up in arms. The MSM went nuts with their outraged cries of racism.</p>
<p>Lesson the Japanese learned? They became publicly silent on pointing out what is obvious on its face.</p>

		<p>Interesting how the article dances around the issue of race. On one hand, we are told that &#8220;race is just a construct;&#8221; on the other hand hand, the article identifies the shortfalls in terms of race. Of course, examining hereditary factors, or the issue of IQ, is not on the table. </p>
<p>What is disturbing about race realism is how it provides an accurate prediction of things such as the education gap. i.e., student performance is directly correlated with media racial IQ values. I say &#8220;disturbing&#8221; because if what race realism says  has validity   &mdash;   and articles like this one indicate it is in the ballpark   &mdash;   then the mass migration of third world peoples into the USA (or Europe) may have calamitous effects. </p>
<p><i>A poorly educated underclass, perpetually living hand to mouth, is exactly what the corporate elites want.</i></p>
<p>No doubt. One can have a sneaking suspicion that elites in the West are replacing their own middle class with a mass of stateless serfs who will do the dirty work and who can be easily manipulated. They can also be played off against the traditional middle class. </p>
<p><i>&ldquo;If their situation is not reversed, democracy is in peril.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Something of a joke when you consider how much of the open borders/affirmative action/multicult agenda has been pushed through in defiance of the wishes of the majority of Americans. <br>

		<p>Just an added note: I have worked with many Mexicans(and other latinos).who have been mainly 1st generation (born here). Most spoke Spanish in the home,but learned English  &mdash;  -I guess! i dont really know  &mdash;  at school or maybe from the general pop culture. Whatever their shortcomings they speak English very well,(the ones I have known) and speak Spanish as well. This is in Chicago and the North Shore  &mdash;  your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>Heh, heh,&hellip; you&rsquo;re leaving out some important details.  The demise of the white, civilized upper class that secluded itself from the also white, &#8220;brutals&#8221; were rendered immortal, grew bored after forming the perfect and politically correct society, with even feminism&rsquo;s outcome of universal male impotence in place.  One male member selectively breeds brutals until he produces Sean Connery&rsquo;s character, who is evolved and now smart enough to figure out how to destroy the technology that &#8220;no one&#8221; could reverse, ending the bore of immortality by bringing back death.  It is a great tale of an over-intellectual society gone too far in the PC direction, producing stagnation.  But in the end, the best do survive and go on, implying a better society will be established, confirming the inevitability of natural selection and human progress.</p>
<p>It is a bizarre, but brilliant science fiction.  It does have lessons for race realists, just not the ones SKIP implies.</p>

		<p>More pablum from the BBC. This line really got to me though:</p>
<p>Dr Veronica Garcia: &ldquo;It is critical that we as Americans wake up and let our politicians know that this achieve gap is not OK&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from your grammar (achieve gap?), which I&rsquo;ll write off to a typo I&rsquo;d like to know: Who&rsquo;s fault is the &#8220;achieve gap&#8221; Miss Garcia? Because the lowest level of Mexican society does nearly anything to come here, legally or not, and my government does nothing to stop them, how am I responsible? Is it my fault that they don&rsquo;t magically transform themselves into cultured, intelligent, productive citizens once they cross the border? Could it be that they only bring with them what they left behind in Mexico (and Guatemala, Salvador, etc.): poverty, ignorance, lack of education, corruption etc.? How are we to change that and how many billions will it cost? The so-called &#8220;War on Poverty begun by Lyndon Johnson cost trillions and had almost no effect whatsoever on rates of poverty among blacks  &mdash;  should we try the same with Hispanics? I&rsquo;d love to hear your answers &#8220;Doctor&#8221;.</p>

		<p>S. California is overwhelmed with Guatemalean and Salvadorean indians.  Here are the average IQs according to wikepedia.</p>
<p>IQ and the Wealth of Nations - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>
The 2006 book IQ and Global Inequality is a follow-up to IQ and the Wealth of &hellip; </p>
<p>84 average IQ for Salvador and 79 for Guatemala.  Both average IQs are lower than the average for American blacks.  Those IQs of 79 and 84 are the countries&rsquo; average.  The indians would have significantly lower IQs, especially those recruited in their mountain villages and brought here by the agricultural, restaurants and hotel industries.</p>
<p>Anything belowe 90 is considered special Ed.  It takes a minimum 90 IQ to get through high school.</p>

<p>The Korean gangsters were fighting over which gang controlled the extorion racket.  There is a practical reason why so many asian businesses don&rsquo;t pay taxes.  The asian extorion gangs take so much that if they paid taxes in addition to the extortion tax their businesses would fail in a month.</p>

George Murphy&rsquo;s (Republican, former actor) campaign denied it FWIW and he went on to defeat Pierre Salinger, winning the US Senate seat. The quote, real or not, drew a lot of flak even then. Imagine the reaction today to such a simple empirically correct observation. QUOTE from TIME 10/16/64:</p>
<p>In agricultural areas, Murphy wins votes for his stand favoring the bracero program, under which fruit and vegetable farmers hire immigrant labor from Mexico. &#8220;You have to remember,&#8221; explains Murphy, &#8220;that Americans can&rsquo;t do that kind of work. It&rsquo;s too hard. Mexicans are really good at that. They are built low to the ground, you see, so it is easier for them to stoop.&#8221;</p>

		<p>As other posters have noted, the latinos come here already poor from their countries.  They have no right to piggy back on the white guilt thing.</p>
<p>And for learning English, why should ANY latinos learn English in the USA now when almost all the labels on food are in spanish, all government documents are in spanish, spanish language radio, tv and cable are popping up all over - even adverts on the sides of buses are often either bilingual, and in some places (like my neck of the woods) completely in spanish!</p>
<p>All the stores and restaurants have complete or mostly latino labor forces.  Of those latinos who do speak English EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM still has an accent, uses grammar improperly and has a very limited vocabulary, even if they were born here and went through the schools.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know how many times I&rsquo;ve had to explain the meaning of what used to be common words words to latinos who are &#8216;fluent&rsquo; english speakers.  Yeah, most latinos are nice enough, but my culture, language and nation are going down the tubes because they&rsquo;re recreating the third world nations they left behind.</p>
