<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Unhappy members of the Congressional Black Caucus &#8220;probably would be marching on the White House&#8221; if Obama were not president, according to CBC Chairman Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.).</p>
<p>&#8220;If [former President] Bill Clinton had been in the White House and had failed to address this problem, we probably would be marching on the White House,&#8221; Cleaver told &#8220;The Miami Herald&#8221; in comments published Sunday. &#8220;There is a less-volatile reaction in the CBC because nobody wants to do anything that would empower the people who hate the president.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rather than targeting Obama&rsquo;s leadership, many CBC members aimed their fire at the Tea Party movement over the summer&rsquo;s congressional recess. Waters said in a public meeting in her district that the Tea Party &#8220;can go straight to hell.&#8221; Another member, Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), called the Tea Party &#8220;the real enemy&#8221; seeking to hold Congress &#8220;hostage.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;There is a less-volatile reaction in the CBC because nobody wants to do anything that would empower the people who hate the president.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
Remember the very minor dust up when Black Ruled Atlanta - Black Ruined Atlanta&rsquo;s Affirmative Action &#8220;judge&#8221; Marvin Arrington kicked all the Whiteys out of his courtroom so he could scold the endless swarm of black defendants?  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised he just didn&rsquo;t send out an order to the Black Ruined Atlanta Police to stop harassing the &#8220;youth&#8221; with the White Man&rsquo;s racist laws.</p>
<p> He escaped any accountability, other than a few interviews, and even Bill Cosby held a big rally at one of the pernicious black colleges and declared &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care if Whites are upset!&#8221;  </p>
<p>The only intelligible excuse Arrington gave was that blacks don&rsquo;t like to dress down other blacks in front of Whites.  <br>
That makes sense to us, and sounds like a good policy for Whites to adopt for ourselves.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, the status system of  Black Ruled America demands that progressive Whites scold other racist Whites (healthy Whites)in order for the status seeking Whites to maintain or advance in society.  </p>
<p><br>
Oftentimes, blacks and other minorities are the true conservatives, because they fight for their own interests.  They win because progressive Whites make sure they win, as long as it doesn&rsquo;t cost those Whites anything personally, but does cost the ones like us lower down the ladder.</p>
<p>But the admission that they don&rsquo;t wanna empower the racist haters comment is priceless. Even liberal Whites can see what&rsquo;s up with that:  racial solidarity, something they abhor in Whites like themselves. </p>
<p>At some point,  their self administered hypocrisy will start to kick against the pricks, especially when they start hurting from Diversity, which is inevitable.  </p>
<p>The Diversity Curse Curses All. </p>
<p>Drip, drip, drip, and thanks to the yet uncensored Internet, a the 21st Century&rsquo;s Great White Awakening is slowly stirring&hellip;</p>
<p>Good thing we never recovered our White Language from the blacks to whom we gave it, because their hateful plans for us are expressed in words we can&rsquo;t misunderstand, even though we only sense a mere shadow of just how much afrovoodoo hatred and violence is symbolized with those words.  </p>
<p>Africans understand action more than words, which are just symbols.  Look for &#8220;African Action&#8221; to become more pronounced in the months to come.  Let&rsquo;s just pray that the victims deserve it, and plenty do.<br>

		<p>It may come as news to members of the Congressional &#8220;Black&#8221; Caucus, but if it weren&rsquo;t for the fact that Obama is president, White folks would likely to be marching on the White House too. </p>

<p>Sorry, Beaver Cleaver.  Not buying it.  President Clinton, at least in his post-1994 &#8220;triangulation&#8221; mode, did a lot of things that, at least for outward consumption, were bad for blacks.  Yet I don&rsquo;t remember any CBC-led protest marches in front of the WH.</p>
<p>In reality, the CBC would never be so vociferous against any Democrat President.</p>

		<p>Why is an organization called &#8220;The Congressional BLACK Caucus&#8221; even allowed to exist?<br>
The very term is racist and an anathema to the concept of a democratic government.<br>
What if there were a &#8220;Congrssional White Caucus&#8221; that buried their representative efforts? </p>

There is a great deal of restraint when a Democrat is in the White House.</p>
<p>While I didn&rsquo;t like President Bush, he was under constant attack.</p>
<p>Where are President Obama&rsquo;s weekly anti-war rallies? Where is Cindy Sheehan (is she over her son&rsquo;s death now that a liberal Democrat is in the White House)?</p>
<p>President Obama has very little public outrage and even less public action.</p>
<p>There is a double standard for Republican and Democrat administrations.<br>

<p>This scares the heck out of me. Over the years, something like ten Section 8 apartment complexes have been planted within two miles of my home. And just 6 miles up the road there is a teeming mother-hive of underclass blacks  &mdash;  it would be so easy for the convoys to come rolling down the road in November 2012. I would love to hear that the authorities are working to secure my family&rsquo;s safety, but  of course this is not the kind of thing any politician would talk about. That would be &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>

		<p>So, what&rsquo;s stopping you? Black handouts&hellip;er&hellip; rights are more important than one man&rsquo;s feelings.<br>
   Last year some war protesters were protesting the war. I told them the only way the overseas wars were going to stop is if we impeach the president (BHO). I loved the look on their face.<br>

<p>You can count on that! There will be full scale riots everywhere and random flash mob &#8220;youf&#8221; attacks from coast to coast.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt thatthe majority of Whites have learned anything though. They&rsquo;ll vote for BHO out of fear. <br>

		<p>As has been stated countless times before, there is no appeasing blacks. They are always angry with someone. Yet, as ticked as they may get at the Obam-imam, they will still side with him in the end - based solely on color. Melanin trumps all.</p>

<p>No.  The media will have to work for at least a week 24/7, showing pictures of Rodney King and lynched blacks before anything like riots start to happen in a big way.  Also there will need be some secret agents spreading around the money and liquor as well as members of some South American military to get in there and get it all going with the fire bombs and stuff like that,</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s one of the few things blacks seem to be good at-marching, besides being perpetually disgruntled at Everything.  As to their employment issues, true, the economy is tough on everyone, but they have only themselves to blame.  As someone pointed out not too long ago on the blog &#8220;Stuff Black people don&rsquo;t like, &#8221;  their F  &mdash;  -you attitudes, problems with attendance and productivity just to hihglight a few of the issues blacks seem to perpetually have, have largely made a good proportion of them unemployable.  But no, don&rsquo;t expect the Congressional Black Caucus to be realistic and honest to confront these problems in the black community.  It&rsquo;s always more conveniant to blame us whites.</p>

<p>Perhaps it won&rsquo;t take them that long to get worked up. The last week before the election, the propaganda organs will be working overtime to get everyone riled up. And win or lose, the blacks will riot&hellip;either from the thrill of victory, or from the agony of defeat (to borrow a famous phrase).</p>
<p>As far as the secret agents spreading money around, any one of several foreign intelligence services could pull it off. MOSSAD, Centro de Investigación y Seguridad Nacional (CISEN)(the Mexican intelligence service)* or the Chinese could direct such an operation in furtherance of their national interests.</p>
<p>*The Mexican intelligence services should not be underestimated. This is a fascinating paper on their history:</p>

<p>Your family&rsquo;s safety is <i>your</i> responsibility, my friend. Your fear will dissipate when you make plans to deal with the situation. The White man&rsquo;s strength is his ability to plan ahead for tough times.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already identified where the potential rioters live, and the direction from which they may attack. If your community has few like-minded individuals (that&rsquo;s one of those &#8220;code words&#8221; for Whites that will fight back and assist other Whites), you may have to plan a temporary or even permanent move away from the area (distasteful as that may be). </p>
<p>You have one year to develop a response. Get busy! Don&rsquo;t let them win!</p>
