<h1>Full Appeals Court to Reconsider Decision Overturning Mich. Ban on Race in College Admissions</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Washington Post, September 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal appeals court on Friday overturned the work of one of its three-judge panels and said it would decide the legality of Michigan&rsquo;s ban on affirmative action in college admissions and government hiring.</p>
<p>The decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals erases a July 1 ruling that found the ban to be unconstitutional. It means more than a dozen judges on the court likely will hear the case again, a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In striking down the law in July, the three-judge panel said the law treats minorities unfairly and violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.</p>
<p>Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said the decision was &#8220;nutty&#8221; and had urged the full court to reopen the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court made the right decision and we look forward to making the case for equality, fairness and the rule of law,&#8221; Schuette said in a statement. &#8220;It is absurd to say a ban on racial discrimination, which Proposal 2 enshrined in our constitution, somehow perpetuates racial discrimination. It simply defies common sense.&#8221;</p>

		<p>These kind of things make no difference really. They just add up to a long litany of race-based discriminations of people of European origin.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to note here, however, is that people of high IQ&rsquo;s tend to have the same incomes regardless of education over their lifetimes(those with an education get a head start which usually diminishes later on).</p>
<p>True, in these days it&rsquo;s very hard to find someone of a high intelligence who did not at least attend college(many highly intelligent students usually drop out to pursue their interests in a more clear and passionate way) if not completed it, but the fact remains.</p>
<p>A more striking fact is that Obama&rsquo;s newest Econ adviser, Alan Kreuger, did a very detailed research paper showing that if you have 1400 in a combined Verbal+Maths score then you will earn just as much as someone who got into Harvard on the same score, if you yourself went to a decent public university instead.</p>
<p>In fact in some cases you may actually earn more if you graduate with less debt. The only group who had a significant difference were hispanics and blacks, where going to an Ivy did make a difference if you had a fairly high SAT score compared to if you had the same score and went to, say, Penn State.</p>
<p>(This is probably because a lot of people recognize that Ivies let in many unqualified blacks and hispanics, which means that if you&rsquo;re, say, black and go to Penn your potential quality in the workforce will likely be very low, so it&rsquo;s very rare to find these people who could have gone to Ivy league schools but didn&rsquo;t if they were black, since blacks often get so many scholarships that they graduate debt-free even if they were languishing at the bottom of the class).</p>
<p>But this is strongest for whites, because there are plenty of easily Ivy-qualified whites in public schools who are high performers but did not get accepted due to our times&rsquo; racial quotas(you see they never went away, just went in the other direction).</p>
<p>But nonetheless, the effects on earnings and power remain the same.<br>
White students are actually not that affected by affirmative action over the course of their life except in a few isolated cases. You might not get to the schools you deserve to be going to, but you&rsquo;ll end up where you belong in the end anyway. </p>
<p>And another plus: these kind of racial quotas makes sure that more and more whites understand that the fairy tales of diversity have a dirty underbelly which is on display if you happen to have the wrong skincolor.</p>
<p>In fact, it is on the rise(quite sharply so):</p>

		<p>Double standards for whites and other races. It is becoming the norm or havent you noticed? </p>
<p>Not only that but it is racist to even object to or question double standards that by the way is even racist to mention or think about. </p>
<p>Thought control. Mindwash. Brainwash. Call it anything you like but its a reality and it will get more real as the white race is taken to extinction level. </p>
<p>Afterall you can simply look at persons facial expression to know whether they agree or disagree and racism can be determined by just that only. </p>
<p>One day the technology of the modern pc age will invent a machine to read your thoughts and techically thats all a computer is anyway is typing out your thoughts. </p>
<p>Only whites are subject to racism in the next phase of eradication of the white race while using the white female for precreationism to beautify the black race steal the good genes for brains but still be classified as black. </p>

<p>Tell that to whites in the military or corporations who are repeatedly passed over for promotions in favor of unqualified blacks and latinos.</p>
<p>Tell that to white would-be firefighters and police who have had their test scores thrown out because &#8220;not enough blacks passed the test.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell that to whites who have been H1B-ed out of programming careers in the high tech industry in favor of Indians and Chinese.</p>
<p>Affirmative Action hurts whites in every aspect of society now. It is only legal, if not encouraged, to actively discriminate against white Americans and only white Americans.  Things will NOT be fair until AA is completely dismantled and eliminated everywhere as the anti-white, racist policy that it is.</p>

		<p>The key finding by Judge R. Guy Cole, a black judge appointed by Clinton,  is that the means by which the state banned such discrimination, a ballot measure amending the Michigan Constitution, violated the Equal Protection Clause. &#8220;Proposal 2 unconstitutionally alters Michigan&rsquo;s political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Basically, Judge Cole is saying that unless you give blacks and others preferential treatment you are violating their Constitutional rights.<br>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.  I&rsquo;m a woman.  When I graduated from high school in 1960 there was universal discrimination against women in private industry.  I had a high IQ and almost perfect SAT scores.  My Mother and her friends told me to go into goverment work, the only job around that hired and promoted solely on the basis of test scores.</p>
<p>So I did.  I got my first and only goverment job in a city agency in 1965 solely on the basis of the written test.  There was an interview but the interview only counted for 10 percent.  The written test counted for 90 percent.  This was wonderful. It went around th HR nonsense of handshake, posture, eye contact, exact shade of lipstick, color of tie, leather or cloth shoelaces etc.</p>
<p>I thought I had a wonderful future.  I thought I would just take a test every few years and as long as I did my work well I would be on a promotional career path.</p>
<p>3 years later affirmative action came along and all pormotions were put on hold until the courts decided the affirmative action lawsuits. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I never got another promotion.  I did however, have to write thousands of written reports for the illiterates who were hired for the next 40 years.</p>
<p>Waht about those who planned a career in school administration and are still classroom teachers working under illiterate black principals and administrators?</p>

		<p>Affirmative action simply means pro-black racial discrimination or anti-white discrimination. We should never be afraid to say that anywhere. Everyone knows it anyway but some claim it is justified. This must be denied - it is simply unconstitutional to discriminate even against whites.</p>

		<p>The courts regularly confuse equal protection with equal results in performance.  Expecting equal results from all groups is a unsubstantiated thinking.  Asians perform better in math and sciences.  Women commit fewer crimes. etc.<br>
&#8220;Nutty&#8221; is an appropriate descriptor when the proscribed cure to make results equal is to give one group extra rights while taking them away from another group. This in a country where the Constitution states that there are equal rights for all.   Darwin&rsquo;s head would spin had he learned a society would purposely hobble its above average to promote those below average.   Then again, why would he even think about such things as that society would soon devolve as a curious afterthought in history, being replaced by societies that do just the opposite.</p>

<p>A high intelligence in of itself is no guarantee of success.<br>
Getting stuck in a government job is also not a big way to good personal satisfaction or earnings.</p>
<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s likely that you would rise much higher if it were not for AA, but the fact is that your story is a story of what happens in a multiracial society where there are deep inequalities.<br>
Also, even if you would be in a totally homogenous society, government jobs are government jobs.</p>
<p>If you would have a more adventerous spirit, you would likely rise much higher. The question is why you tolerated being put down upon for so long, your entire career it seems, despite your high intelligence.</p>
<p>High intelligence is merely potential. You must use it well too and you failed that test.</p>
