<h1><a href="http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1109/110915losangeles.htm">Los Angeles-Area Immigration Consultants Charged in Asylum Fraud Scheme</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>ICE, September 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The owner of a Los Angeles-area immigration consulting business and one of his employees are expected to make their initial appearance in federal court Thursday for their alleged role in a scheme involving hundreds of Chinese nationals who sought asylum in the United States based upon phony claims of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Haoren Ma, 47, of San Gabriel, Calif., owner of New Arrival Immigration Service, and Minghan Dong, 55, of San Gabriel, Calif., an employee of Ma&rsquo;s, were taken into custody Wednesday afternoon by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&rsquo;s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents. Ma was arrested at his San Gabriel residence. Dong was taken into custody at New Arrival&rsquo;s San Gabriel office.</p>
<p>The two men are charged in a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court with immigration benefit fraud and failing to disclose their role as preparers on the asylum applications. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.</p>
<p>According to the case affidavit, Ma and Dong charged from $3,500 to $6,500 to prepare and file the fraudulent asylum applications. In those filings, the defendants claimed their Chinese clients fled China after being persecuted for their Christian beliefs. That, despite the fact two of the asylum applicants whose cases are cited in the affidavit told the defendants they were Buddhists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Over the course of the investigation, HSI agents reviewed dozens of asylum applications prepared by the defendants. The affidavit notes many of those applications contained nearly identical accounts of purported persecution, including descriptions of underground church meetings that led to the applicant&rsquo;s arrest and torture by Chinese authorities. The affidavit goes on to describe how the defendants provided their clients with detailed written materials and audio tapes on Christianity to help them prepare for their asylum interviews. One of the DVDs furnished to a confidential informant posing as an asylum seeker was labeled &#8220;Jesus 1.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based upon queries of databases maintained by the immigration courts, ICE HSI investigators have linked the defendants to more than 800 asylum applications filed since 2000, making it one of the largest asylum fraud cases uncovered in the Los Angeles area in recent years.</p>

		<p>Chinese &#8216;immigration consultants&rsquo; have figured out how to sell a product (U.S. citizenship) for a fee.</p>
<p>The practice is widespread, as the following article from 2007 shows:</p>

<p>Ten Chinatown store owners arrested for selling illegal pesticides after woman nearly dies</p>
<p>BY Jennifer H. Cunningham <br>
DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER <br>
Monday, September 19th 2011, 7:37 PM</p>
<p>Ten Chinatown store owners were busted for selling illegal super-concentrated rat poison Monday after a woman nearly died from drinking a small bottle labeled &#8220;The Cat Be Unemployed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Federal and state investigators arrested the owners - mostly at mom-and-pop shops on East Broadway - and seized more than 6,000 packages of illicit Chinese pesticides, said Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance.</p>
<p>Some of the seized pesticides were made to look like cookie crumbs or Easter eggs and &#8220;were so concentrated that a small vial, injested accidentally, could kill an adult male,&#8221; Vance said.</p>
<p>The rodenticide labeled &#8220;The Cat Be Unemployed&#8221; contained 40 to 60 times the EPA&rsquo;s legal limit levels of brodifacoum, a blood thinner that makes rats bleed to death internally.</p>
<p>A woman lost two-thirds of her blood after ingesting a two-inch tall vial of the blue-green liquid, believing it was medication, according to court documents.</p>
<p>&#8220;She thought it was some type of medicine,&#8221; said EPA Region II Administrator Judith Enck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, she didn&rsquo;t die, but she became gravely ill.&#8221;</p>

		<p>china has no religion, there is only one obsession,money.<br>
for an average chinese city resident who earns 2000 a month</p>
<p>the primary goal that occupies his/her mind day and night is how to earn 2100 next month&hellip;</p>
<p>almost every human loves money, but for chinese earning 2500 a month will cause big jealousy from those who earn 2000.</p>
<p>who cares about anything else?</p>
