			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), September 30, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a twist to notions of race identity, new 2010 census figures show an unexpected reason behind a renewed growth in the U.S. white population: more Hispanics listing themselves as white in the once-a-decade government count.</p>
<p>The shift is due to recent census changes that emphasise &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; as an ethnicity, not a race.</p>
<p>While the U.S. government first made this distinction in 1980, many Latinos continued to use the &#8216;some other race&rsquo; box to establish a Hispanic identity.</p>
<p>In a switch, the 2010 census forms specifically instructed Latinos that Hispanic origins are not races and to select a recognised category such as white or black.</p>
<p>The result: a six percent increase in white Americans as tallied by the census, even though there was little change among non-Hispanic whites. </p>
<p>In all, the number of people in the &#8216;white alone&rsquo; category jumped by 12.1 million over the last decade to 223.6 million.</p>
<p>Based on that definition, whites now represent 72 percent of the U.S. population and account for nearly half of the total population increase since 2000.</p>
<p>Broken down by state, California and Texas were home to nearly half of Hispanics who identified as white, followed by Florida and New York. </p>
<p>Together, these four states comprised nearly two-thirds of the &#8216;white alone&rsquo; population who were Hispanic.</p>
<p>Of the total U.S. population in 2010 of 309 million people, 231 million were white, 74 per cent. A decade earlier, the white population was about 217 million, or 77 per cent of the almost 282 million total then.</p>
<p>In addition, the white population grew at a slower rate  &mdash;  six per cent  &mdash;  over the past decade than the total population, which increased by almost 10 per cent, according to census officials.</p>
<p>Much of the 14 million increase in the white population involved whites of Hispanic origin. For example, respondents could identify themselves as white Hispanics, black Hispanics or as Hispanics in any of the other racial categories.</p>
<p>&#8216;The white population has become more diverse as evidenced by the growth of the Hispanic white population and the multiple-race white population,&rsquo; including black-white and white-Asian people, according to the 2010 census analysis released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Some demographers say the broadened white category in 2010 could lead to a notable semantic if not cultural shift in defining race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Due to the impact of Hispanics, the nation&rsquo;s fastest-growing group, the Census Bureau has previously estimated that whites will become the minority in the U.S. by mid-century. That is based on a definition of whites as non-Hispanic, who are now at 196.8million.</p>
<p>That could change, if the common conception of white were to shift.</p>
<p>&#8216;What&rsquo;s white in America in 1910, 2010 or even 2011 simply isn&rsquo;t the same,&rsquo; said Robert Lang, sociology professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.</p>
<p>He cited the many different groups of European immigrants in the early 20th century who later became known collectively as white.</p>
<p>He noted that today that could mean a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant in upstate New York or Jews and Italians in the lowest east side of Manhattan.</p>
<p>The Census news comes as it was revealed that for the first time in American history, the largest portion of children in poverty are not white. </p>
<p>According to a new figures, Hispanic children now make up the majority of those under 18 who live in poverty. </p>
<p>Even though this figure was released on Wednesday, the tension caused by increased racial diversity in American lower classes is having an effect on federal policies and funding. </p>
<p>&#8216;We are really at a crossroads,&rsquo; said William H. Frey, a representative from a Washington think-tank called the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>The number of Hispanics in the U.S. is increasing, and because of the bad economy, the group&rsquo;s presence among the country&rsquo;s poorest residents is exponentially increasing. </p>
<p>The Pew Center says that even though Hispanic adults only make up 16.3 per cent of the total U.S. population, Hispanic children make up 23.1 per cent of the country&rsquo;s children. </p>
<p>Their presence is even larger when only those in poverty are examined; there, Hispanic children make up the majority- 37 per cent. </p>
<p>The disparity is a direct effect of a high birth rate among Hispanics. </p>
<p>The terrible economy then did its part. </p>
<p>Hispanics were disproportionally hit by the recession, with an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent as compared to the national rate of 9.1 per cent.</p>
<p>The number of Hispanic children in poverty jumped in 2010- the most recent available data- by a half million, making the total 6.1 million children.</p>
<p>Due to calculations, however, it is more likely for a black child to be poor because they have a higher rate of poverty- 39.1 per cent as compared to 35 per cent for Hispanics- but there are more Hispanic children on the whole, tilting the statistics so that Hispanics take the unhappy title. The report, released by the Pew Center, says there are 4.3 million black children in poverty as compared to 6.1 Hispanic children.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the issue of the diversification of America&rsquo;s poor came to the forefront of political debate with the December failure of the DREAM Act federally, which would have allowed illegal immigrants to receive privately funded scholarships to attend the state&rsquo;s public colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The bill passed in California and Maryland, but it seems unlikely to pass nationally because a Republican majority took control of the House of Representatives since the last vote. </p>
<p>&#8216;These new young immigrants and their children need a pathway to the middle class  &mdash;  good educations, affordable housing and jobs  &mdash;  at the same time federal and state budgets are strapped for funds,&rsquo; Mr Fey said. </p>
<p>&#8216;While we face tough choices, the quality of our future labour force depends on meeting their needs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The future is bound to bring big changes as well, with census projections expecting whites to make up a minority of the population for the first time in 2042. </p>
<p>Earlier projections put that turning point eight years later, but a surge in Hispanic population due to increased immigration and high birth rates moved the date up significantly. </p>
<p>By 2050, the percentage of Hispanics in America will double its present 15 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>

<p>- Big changes indeed. I predict the census of 2080 will show a 100% White demographic in a new nation called something like &#8220;The United States of America&#8221;.  Sound familar?  It should, because Whites will be able to keep the current title.  Blacks won&rsquo;t have anything to do with any such naming convention, but will create their own new state and call it something with having &#8220;Africa&#8221; in the title.  The Hispanics will just expand Mexico or create a new Aztlan type homeland.  I&rsquo;m not sure where any of the other ethnic groups will end up, but Whites will certainly have a much smaller area to call home.</p>

		<p>before all of the Anglo Hispaniphobes rush in to say that Hispanics are not &#8220;white&#8221;, please remember that there are many, many people of 90% or more Caucasian/European ancestry within the Hispanic culture. Many of us have a bloodline that can be directly traced to Spain, Portugal, Italy or any combination of the three. </p>
<p>There are many, many White Cubans, White Mexicans and White South Americans. The nation of Costa Rica in Central America is very white, as is most of Nicaragua, so is Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and much of Ecuador. In the state of New Mexico, many native-born Hispanics are White descendents of the Spanish settlers when it was under the Viceroy of New Spain. In Mexico, Argentina and many places in Central America there are also entire towns of people of mostly German ancestry where Spanish and German are spoken interchangeably. </p>

		<p>Hispanic Whites are White. As White as WASPS, Irish, Italians, or any other Whites. People with visible Amerindian or African ancestry are not White, whatever language they speak and whatever box they mark on a census. <br/>
I&rsquo;d be curious to know how many of the people who identify as &#8220;White Hispanics&#8221; are in fact White. </p>

<p>Most so-called whites in Costa Rica, Nicaraqua, Chile and Ecuador have Indian admixture which explains their backward civilizations.  200 years of independence from Spain and the best they have been able to do is to periodically overthrow their own governments.  You can keep them.  I prefer to live in a real European America, not an unreasonable facsimle of one.</p>

		<p>The original founding stock of this nation (pre 1800) is Scottish, English, German, Dutch, Swedish, some Irish, some French and a sprinkle of a few others.</p>
<p>These groups inter-married and created the people known as the &#8220;Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 1800s to 1900s found a big influx of more Irish, Jews and then lots of southern and eastern Europeans.</p>
<p>Okay, there was tension, but they started to blend in because they were all the basic same range of skin tones and cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Africans who were unfortunately brought here kept to themselves in the South until the Great Migration Northward that started in the 1920s and 30s.  Then they invaded northern towns and cities and started the civil rights movement in order to get a piece of the white man&rsquo;s pie.</p>
<p>Guilty white liberals started welfare, thinking it would help blacks along this path, but all it did was destroy the black family and black civil society.  Now millions of immigrants want on that gravy train, and have flooded into this country over the last 20-30 years, changing the character and complexion of the nation.</p>
<p>The new immigrants are takers, and do not really want to give, or at least sacrifice to better the lives of their descendants in the same way that previous generations of whites did.</p>
<p>I have been saying all along that original founding stock Americans are less than 40% of the population.  This article that highlights how Arabs, lots of latinos and many other groups claim to be white, is proof that the numbers are grossly inflated.  They don&rsquo;t want us to know the truth until it&rsquo;s too late and we are a persecuted minority in the land of our fathers.</p>

		<p>I agree with Frederico. There are many Hispanics that are white. We trace our ancestry back to Spain, which last I checked is a white European country. Not all Latinos are mestizos or mulattoes. About 40% of Puerto Ricans are white and about 60% of Cubans are white. Many of us have the same features of the Italians, Greeks and people of southern France. </p>

		<p>From a racial point of view, Hispanic is not a racial category. While Andy Garcia and Cameron Diaz are white and Hispanic, Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales are not white but Hispanic.</p>
<p>Spain, Argentina and Uruguay are predominantly (actually almost completely) white and Hispanic, on the contrary Bolivia and large chunks of Central America are predominantly not white but Hispanic.</p>

		<p>Yeah&hellip;the numbers are kind of skewed, if one credits the direst scenario.  Many Hispanics ARE very white.  Many more are &#8220;white enough&#8221; for my (perhaps moderately broad) definition.</p>
<p>I think if we dig hard enough in the old woodpile&hellip;we&rsquo;ll most of us whitey&rsquo;s find something not exactly &#8220;pure caucasian&#8221;, depending again on the definition.  </p>
<p>Most commonly agreeable &#8220;white&#8221; populations, even in the old days, consisted of a white genetic overlay of some native population, many of whom, even as far north as Britain, are known to have been, or suspected to have been, darker or different from the lighter &#8220;caucasians&#8221; into whom their genetic heritage mixed.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks mixed with the Pelasgians, a Minoan looking people.  The Hungarians are a mixture of whites and Asiatics (and the Gabor sisters were gorgeous white women).  Scandinavians mixed with Lapps, an Inuit looking people, and as Europe grew in power and wealth, millions of non Europeans from almost anywhere - even the unmentionable place - mixed genetically with Europeans to form&hellip;</p>
<p>Modern white people!</p>
<p>Not that I don&rsquo;t fear our folk being blighted from this world, but neither do I think too narrow a definition serves Whites.  Nor do I believe it to be very scientifically sound.  Furthermore I think the white bloodline is stronger than we may imagine.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with Frederico. Cubans in US are almost all white. A lot or may be most of those Latinos, who call themselves white in the census, may have a case. I know many Brazilians and Puerto Ricans here in US and almost all of them are white. Another thing is that all those predictions about whites being minority by 2050 may not after all come true. Why?<br/>
Because Mexican and other latino countries fertility rate is dropping, and is already on, or below US level. Predictions of &#8220;white minority&#8221; assume steady, high immigration and fertility, based on so called &#8220;current trends&#8221;. But the trends are changing all the time. Current net migration rate between Mexico and US is zero. Number of those who come in, eaquals number of those who go back. Today working in auto parts factory in Mexico gives you still less money than cleaning swimming pools in US, but not a lot less. More and more often its not worthy to leave for few bucks more. Latino immigration has reached its peak in period 2000-2005 but right now is much smaller. </p>

		<p>There is no way in hell that most Hispanics in the U.S are White, especially since most Hispanics in this country are Mexican and the average Mexican is 59% Native American in ancestry.</p>
<p>If most Hispanics in the U.S were from Argentina, Uruguay, or Spain, than I would believe that statistic. But Argentineans, Uruguayans, and Spaniards make up a very small percentage of the Hispanic population in the U.S.</p>

		<p>You really know that Whites in the USA are finished when the Government starts to use ruses and tricks like this to artificially inflate the White percentage of the population.<br/>
  Generally, governments do things like this (eg fiddling unemployment statistics with &#8216;new definitions&rsquo;), when they are worried about something and are trying to conceal it.</p>

&#8216;<b>There are many, many White Cubans, White Mexicans and White South Americans.&#8221;   &mdash;   Federico </b></p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p><br/>
Federico is correct,  and I have often tried to make that point here myself. Hispanic correctly  means &#8220;from Spain&#8221;  (Hispania in Latin). And Spain is a country in Europe.  Like all European countries, it is white. Indeed, many Spaniards are whiter than some other Mediterranean peoples. </p>
<p>HOWEVER&hellip; those white people living  in Latin America are generally well off and comfortable.  Some are very rich.  They have no great desire to migrate here when they are doing so well where they are. Unlike here, whites are still in control in Latin America, and they have no intention of giving it up. </p>
<p>The great mass of immigrants who are flooding into the USA are  mulattos and mestizos from the lowest classes of those countries.  Some of them (the Indios and pure blacks) have no connection with &#8216;Hispania&rsquo; at all.  The term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is purely a fabrication of the census bureau, which can mean whatever they want it to mean. They claim it is not racial. </p>
<p>Thus, our &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; immigration is predominately non-white. Very few of them that I see would qualify for our definition of white. </p>
<p>Incidentally, other names have been proposed in the past   &mdash;    Indo-American, for instance. That would be more accurate than &#8220;Latin&#8221; or &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; which only refer to the upper classes.  </p>
<p>But due to the Left&rsquo;s strict aversion to any references regarding race (which is not supposed to exist), they prefer to define people in terms of language and culture (which are acceptable within Marxism) &hellip; hence Hispanic.  When we use the term &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;, we are unconsciously deferring to the terminology of the Marxist Left. </p>

  <br/>

  <br/>
That could change, if the common conception of  &#8220;white&#8221; were to shift.  </b></p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>What on earth is a  &#8220;multiple-race white population&#8221;? <br/>
That is a bizarre term, if ever there was one. </p>
<p>In the countries south of the border, the concept of race (or of whiteness) is much more flexible than here.   In Mexico, officially, everyone pretends to be a mestizo   &mdash;    even the whitest of the white. This is in order to maintain the peace and keep the Indians pacified. It seems to work quite well.  &#8220;We are all mestizos&#8221; is the national motto.</p>
<p>In Brazil, on the other hand, anyone with a drop of  Caucasian ancestry can claim to be white   &mdash;     exactly the opposite of the &#8220;one drop rule&#8221; in the USA.</p>
<p>So what is &#8220;white&#8221;?  It all depends on whom you ask!    We know what &#8220;white&#8221;  means,  but other cultures do not agree.   When we say &#8220;white&#8221;, we mean ALL white, nothing less.  As the (so-called) &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; element grows here,  whiteness will become a much more flexible term to accommodate those who want to be white.   The statistics will become more inaccurate, and real whites will become more minoritized.</p>

		<p>2-Fredrico: &#8220;before all of the Anglo Hispaniphobes rush in to say that Hispanics are not &ldquo;white&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>- Beat you by three minutes&hellip; and yes, I agree that Hispanics are not White. &#8220;Hispaniphobe&#8221;? Hmm&hellip; I guess I&rsquo;m a Blackophobe and Asiaphobe as well. It seems I am no longer, as decribed by others, just a run of the mill racist, now I&rsquo;m a race specific racist. Not that it bothers me.</p>
<p>And: &#8220;many people of 90% or more Caucasian/European ancestry within the Hispanic culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Excellent, and a key point: &#8220;Hispanic culture&#8221;.  I am far more comfortable in an environment where everyone is White and speaking German as compared to where everyone is &#8220;White&#8221; and speaking Spanish.  It is an issue of the combination of race and culture.  I believe you understand my point of view, as you have points of debate, but I don&rsquo;t yet understand why it is that you wish so badly to claim to be &#8220;White&#8221;.  Even if your skin is Whiter than mine, that really isn&rsquo;t the entire point of issue.</p>
<p>5-Istvan: Excellent post!</p>
<p>7-Gripona: &#8220;There are many Hispanics that are white.&#8221; - An oxymoron when speaking of the United States.</p>
<p>11-Anon: &#8220;Cubans in US are almost all white.&#8221; - Please see above comment in reference to #7.</p>
<p>17-ghw: &#8220;As the (so-called) &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; element grows here, whiteness will become a much more flexible term to accommodate those who want to be white.&#8221; - Usually I agree with much of your postings; not so much with this one though.  The idea that the definition of Whiteness changing is difficult for me to take in. Granted, if the speed of change is slow enough, we may well avoid greater conflict. That our nation is changing at an unheard of pace though, does not bode well for the future.</p>

		<p>We need to stop using &#8216;hispanic&rsquo; or &#8216;latino&rsquo; since all parties agree it is not a race.</p>
<p>Amerindians is a better term for the poorest of the poor spanish speaking immigrants.</p>
<p>Mestizos for the rest</p>
<p>Those spanish speakers who are white or mostly so, most of us generally have no problem with as they are genetically similar to us.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s stop using hispanic and latino because it lumps three groups together that don&rsquo;t even get along with each other in their own countries!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like lumping blacks, indians, arabs, whites, asians of every kind and on and on in a category called &#8220;American&#8221; simply because they all have citizenship.  But we all know these different groups have little to nothing in common on the landmass we all live on.</p>

		<p>Some Hispanic chose white on the census form because they dont<br/>
see themselves as black, Asian or Native American, and they<br/>
have to pick a race. They may not see themselves as white either<br/>
but they also dont see themselves as the other races on the<br/>
census form. And white maybe the largest contribution<br/>
to their gene pool . So they chose white as their is nothing<br/>
to loose in chosing any race.<br/>
.  Maybe the form should include &#8216;Hispanic&rsquo; as a racial<br/>
group in addition to White, Black, Asian and Native American.</p>

		<p>I lived in Costa Rica.  Lots of white people.  Many are descended from Galicians (the Irish of Spain) who settled there with their women.  Not saying there&rsquo;s no mixture.  There was a native population which largely suffered the same fate as North American Indians.  On the east coast there are blacks brought in (after the Chinese died like flies) to build the country&rsquo;s railroad a century or more ago.</p>
<p>But by and large I met many very white looking Costa Ricans, including blondes, green eyed, freckled, redheads who looked like they could have come from right down the road&hellip;  </p>

		<p>I have to agree with Frederico. Cubans in US are almost all white.</p>
<p>______</p>
<p>I totally disagree. My old town of West New York, NJ was flooded with canecutters in the early 60&rsquo;s. They was supposedly Cuba&rsquo;s upper middle class. I&rsquo;d call maybe 10% of them White (the offspring of our Navy sailors perhaps?). Most of them were brown, squatty Amerindian types. The ones left behind were Bantus and mulattos, who seem to like communism. I saw very few of them.</p>
<p>Most Hispanic countries like Mexico (9% White) rarely have their White citizens emigrate, as they are the upper class and are doing quite well there. Thus, most of the Hispanics we see are not White.</p>

		<p>If most Hispanics are &#8220;White&#8221;, than why did liberals and Hispanics refer to the SB1070 immigration law as racist when according to liberals there is no such thing as racism against White people.</p>
<p>Liberals and Hispanics contradict themselves. So Hispanics are referred to as &#8220;White&#8221; for census purposes and when they commit violent crimes, but when it comes to affirmative action programs and laws that kick out illegal immigrants than all of a sudden Hispanics are referred to as Brown/People Of Color.</p>
<p>So a Mexican gangbanger for example who kills a Black person is charged with a hate crime and labeled as &#8220;White&#8221; by the F.B.I.</p>
<p>While a Mexican who tries to get into Harvard for example is labeled as Brown so she or he can get accepted into that school through affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Frederico  It is true that many hispanics are White.  They are not the problem.  The problem is the indians.</p>
<p>I went to a California Catholic school in the 1950&rsquo;s.  There were some children in the school and families in the parish with Spanish last names.  They were brunette Whites.  Some of the families came directly from Spain because of the communist invasion of the 1930&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Spanish named people in the parish were considered totally White, no different from any other White.</p>
<p>Then in 1968 the communist front Ford Foundation created the hispanic race, MALDEF, LARAZA, MECHA and other hispanic indian race warfare groups.  The courts of course went along with it and in I believe 1972? some commie judge obeyed Ford Foundation diktats and officially created the hispanic race.</p>
<p>The problem in America is that most of the hispanic immigrants are 4ft6 pure indian women and 4ft10 pure indian men from the post primitive backwoods areas of L America.</p>
<p>Most are mexicans and guatamaleans.  Every hispanic I see in Los Angeles is either pure or mostly indian, on welfare and working for far less than minimum wage and stealing jobs from Americans.</p>
<p>We at amren did not create the hispanic race.  The Ford Foundation and the federal Judiciary did. AS soon as that happened, the federal goverment forced states and counties to extend all sorts of welfare benefits to &#8220;hispanics&#8221; that are denied to Whites.<br/>
 A translator told me that in many areas of mexico the children do not go to school at all.  Reason being that the school is in town.  There are no school or other buses.  The parents have no cars. So the kids don&rsquo;t go to school.</p>
<p>Then they come here, pure indians from primitive villages whose average IQ is somwhere between 80 and 87 depending on how much indian blood they have and just how primitive the village and we are expected to raise their IQs 30 points in just one generation so they can not just finish high school but graduate from a third tier college.</p>
<p>White L. Americans and mexicans have had 500 years to bring their indians up to 21th century level.  Don&rsquo;t expect us to do it in 1 generation.</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t blame amreners for calling Whites and indians all hispanics.  Blame the Ford Foundation and the Judge who made it official.</p>
<p>Just another reason to dump English anglo saxon common law the worst Judicial system in the world.  One Judge can create a human race.</p>

<p>Brent Nelson once did a study of ethnic white American political involvement.  Controlling for a lot of variables and keeping as many things as possible equal, he found that the two most politically active white American ethnic groups are Irish Catholics (explicitly Catholics) and Scandinavians.  For all the discussion about them, (and by &#8220;discussion,&#8221; I mean paranoia), American Jews are slightly below the white American average for political participation.  The U.S. Senate being disproportionately Jewish on the high side is just an anomaly - New York City didn&rsquo;t get its first Jewish mayor until 1974, and with NYC being what it is, that is surprisingly late.</p>

		<p>Very few Hispanics in America are white.  The ones who are white tend to intermarry with other whites and don&rsquo;t think of themselves as &#8220;Hispanic.&#8221;  The claim that 40% of Puerto Ricans are white is utterly absurd.  A recent DNA study put the true number at 2%.  Anyone who thinks that people who look like the people in those pictures are white is insane.

Plus a lot of times even the Mexicans and whites seem to get along better than the Africans do. I think we have more in common sometimes with the &#8216;hispanics&rsquo; latins&rsquo; than we do than the Africans that have been here over 400 years. </p>

<p>Sorry, but you seem to confuse the Scotch-Irish (Protestants) who came to the US before the 18th century with the Irish (Catholics) who mostly came after.  Anonymous #6 was referring to the original founding stock of the US (pre 1800) and he did not mention the Italians for that period anyway.  As for the French, I recall that they settled in North America long before the US even existed.  Never heard of that little place called &#8220;New France&#8221; (1534-1763) which spread from New Foundland all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico before the French and Indian War ?  <a href="http://goo.gl/16t8i" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/16t8i</a></p>
<p>I wonder where these &#8220;Huguenots&#8221;, &#8220;Coureur des bois&#8221;, &#8220;Cajuns&#8221;, &#8220;Grand Teton&#8221;, &#8220;Vermont&#8221;, &#8220;Maine&#8221;, &#8220;Michigan&#8221;, &#8220;Illinois&#8221;, &#8220;Cadillac&#8221;, &#8220;Louisiana&#8221; names come from and who founded Juneau (AK), Chicago(IL), Detroit(MI), Saint-Paul(MN), Dubuque (IA), Green Bay (WI), Coeur d&rsquo;Alene (ID), Saint-Louis (MO), Mobile (AL), Biloxi (MS), New-Orleans and Baton Rouge (LA)? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_American" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_American</a></p>

		<p>&#8220;There are many, many White Cubans, White Mexicans and White South Americans. The nation of Costa Rica in Central America is very white, as is most of Nicaragua, so is Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and much of Ecuador. In the state of New Mexico, many native-born Hispanics are White descendents of the Spanish settlers when it was under the Viceroy of New Spain. In Mexico, Argentina and many places in Central America there are also entire towns of people of mostly German ancestry where Spanish and German are spoken interchangeably.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have noticed this argument being brought up a few times on AR. Totally ridiculous. I have just come from Ecuador, at most 10% of the people are even remotely White. Same with Mexico, Nicaragua,Costa Rica. In fact Costa Rica is a very interesting case many people claim to be pure Spanish there. However the reality is 95% of the people do not even resemble Europeans. Argentina and Uruguay are mostly White that much is true. However our Hispanic immigrants are 95% non-White. Just look at the countries they come from. Plus White Latin Americans rarely come to the U.S. Also only the fist wave of Cubans were White. The elite. After that they were almost all Black or mulattos. I grew up and live in Los Angeles the reality is in my whole life I have met probably ten White Hispanics compared thousands on the other side. Do not be fooled by these comments like the original poster. Hispanics in America are Non-White!</p>

<p>1.  Yes, i know Hungarians call themselves Magyars, in that they are descended in part from the &#8220;Magyars&#8221;, a Turkic/Mongolian people that filtered into Europe shortly after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the west.  The other Europeans referred to them erroneously as &#8220;Huns&#8221; for obvious historical reasons I&rsquo;ll not belabor the reader with now.</p>
<p>They probably, like the Huns before them, mixed with the now almost extinct, western Iranic tribes such as the Skythians, Sarmatians, and Roxolani that stood between them and Europe over the centuries they spent drifting westward. </p>
<p>As far as the Lapps are concerned, I know they look pretty white these days, after MILLENIA of mixing with Indo-European Scandinavians.  Thanks for corroborating my point.</p>
<p>You know who I think of Hitler as?  Arguably the most prolific mass murderer of white people and the individual most responsible for the near suicide of Western Civilization yet.</p>

The majority of Cubans, and a large number of Colombians, Venezuelans, etc. are of European extraction.

Was there any new criteria in the 2010 US Census that should make us think this data is misleading?</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have been saying all along that original founding stock Americans are less than 40% of the population. This article that highlights how Arabs, lots of latinos and many other groups claim to be white, is proof that the numbers are grossly inflated. They don&rsquo;t want us to know the truth until it&rsquo;s too late and we are a persecuted minority in the land of our fathers.&#8221;</p>

His family had been in South America for about 5 generations, and he self-identified as Argentinian.

		<p>Approximately two-thirds of Hispanics in the United States are Mexicans, and the White Mexicans are not those who are coming here to pick tomatoes and clean bathrooms.  Of the remaining third of American Hispanics, most of those are from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and from other parts of Latin America with a great deal of African and Amerindian blood.  White Hispanics are over represented on college campuses, in corporate headquarters, in government offices, and in other organizations that buttress their &#8220;diversity&#8221; figures by recruiting the least disadvantaged members of the disadvantaged minority groups. </p>

All those pictures are of people who look hispanic. A white hispanic is someone who you can&rsquo;t tell he or she is unless he or she speaks spanish or tells you they are. <br/>
Deniz&rsquo;s picture are more like the white hispanics we refer to. If you saw these kids on the street in America you wouldn&rsquo;t flag them as hispanic. I think for the next census there has to be a Mestizo box or better yet Aztec or Maya. That way those Mexicans that are so proud of their heritage can be more truthful.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Sorry, but you seem to confuse the Scotch-Irish (Protestants) who came to the US before the 18th century with the Irish (Catholics) who mostly came after.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is absolutely no difference whatsoever between the two. The early Irish who came to America (a lot of whom were Catholics who converted to Protestantism upon their arrival to the colonies) freely identified themselves as Irish.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t start calling themselves Scoth-Irish or Anglo-Irish until much later.</p>

		<p>Yes, i know Hungarians call themselves Magyars, in that they are descended in part from the &ldquo;Magyars&rdquo;, a Turkic/Mongolian people that filtered into Europe shortly after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the west. The other Europeans referred to them erroneously as &ldquo;Huns&rdquo; for obvious historical reasons I&rsquo;ll not belabor the reader with now.</p>
<p>They probably, like the Huns before them, mixed with the now almost extinct, western Iranic tribes such as the Skythians, Sarmatians, and Roxolani that stood between them and Europe over the centuries they spent drifting westward.<br/>
____<br/>
This would be off topic but you really should stop believing in romantic history. I&rsquo;m Turkish and I&rsquo;ve lived in Hungary, can speak intermediate Hungarian and know their history quite well. Apart from some loan words (Ottoman period), nothing is common between two nations. I&rsquo;ve never encountered with an Mongolomorph (possessing some asiatic features) individual, let alone Mongloid.</p>
<p>Magyars were in fact never Turkic or Mongloid but distantly related to other Finnic tribes (it explains some very small amounts of Haplogroup N). Anthropologically (old school), they were Iron Age Nordic and Baltic (in majority) which are quite common in core Hungarian territory (Puszta region). </p>
<p>The allegedly purest Magyars known as Szekely in today&rsquo;s Romania are known for their fair features (up to 70% light eyes, blond hair is very common too), tall stature and mesocephalic (CI 80-81) heads in relatively dark Romania. Hardly Turkic or Mongloid. </p>
<p>Genetically, they are up to 75% European Upper Paleolithic (R1a, R1b, I), the rest is made up by Neolithic contributions from the south/south-east Europe. If they were Mongloid or Asiatic, they should have some C, Q or even N. But they are less than 1% combined and it&rsquo;s very unlikely for a nation to change so thoroughly from a primary race to another. Interestingly neighbouring countries like Austria, Slovakia and Ukraine appear to have more C, Q and N than Hungary.</p>
<p>The user Istvan is most probably of Hungarian origin. He can give you some information or correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong or missed anything. </p>

What about all  the Bourbon and Marquette cities, counties, universities, avenues scattered  across the USA?  One coud go on and on endlessly.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give credit where it&rsquo;s due and not squabble among ourselves.   Though of British Isles descent myself, I must say that  the French    &mdash;   and Dutch, and Spanish -  even Swedes   &mdash;    were here sometimes before the English.  All came together under Anglo-Saxon leadership, and all  have contributed to the making of America (although not necessarily in equal amounts, depending on their numbers).   And, giving credit to our fellow Europeans  who arrived later, they also did the same.  They were interested in building America, not disuniting it.  They came here to contribute, not destroy.  We should respect each other. To separate and atomize us into squabbling ethnic groups is the goal of the Left. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not hispanophobe.  I know very well that there is a major difference between White and indian L. Americans.  Every person I have every known from Brazil, Argentina and Costa Rica has been a fair skinned European who is not even stereotypical Spaniish.</p>
<p>The hispanics we are concerned about are the low IQ indians from primitive villages who are not only brought here in the millions but as soon as they step foot in the country are are granted all sorts of affirmative action privileges that White Americans are denied.</p>
<p>Phobe does not mean hatred or dislike. It means an unreasnonable fear; unreasonable fear, not a reasonable fear.  I always correct those who throw the word homophobia around claiming it means hatred or dislike.  So I&rsquo;ll correct those who throw the word hispanophobia around.</p>
<p>Consult a dictionary. </p>
<p>L. American Whites do not allow the losest levels of their society to take over.  Do you expect White Americans to favor the take over of America by the most primitive citizens of L. America?</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with Frederico. There are many Hispanics that are white. We trace our ancestry back to Spain, which last I checked is a white European country. Not all Latinos are mestizos or mulattoes. About 40% of Puerto Ricans are white and about 60% of Cubans are white. Many of us have the same features of the Italians, Greeks and people of southern France. &#8220;</p>
<p>The &#8220;whites&#8221; you list in Southern Europe look the way they do due to increasing Arab and Turkish genetic drift.  Currently, it is happening even faster and recent reports say that white Southern Europe is doomed.  &#8220;Same features?&#8221;  Only vaguely and as far as brown or olive skin and brown eyes, etc., allow.  Puerto Ricans and other alleged white Hispanics are dark because they have native &#8220;Indian&#8221; genetics, and often black genetics.  The results although generally similar in appearance actually are not, and affect the cultural expression, and can&rsquo;t be called white, or European, but maybe European influenced.  The Amerind and Latino habit of blurring distinctions to make specific claims is one item that rather identifies as less white and European.</p>
<p>I knew a gay Mexican man who wore blue contacts.  He adamantly claimed he was white.  He was deeply self-deluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;before all of the Anglo Hispaniphobes rush in to say that Hispanics are not &ldquo;white&rdquo;, please remember that there are many, many people of 90% or more Caucasian/European ancestry within the Hispanic culture. Many of us have a bloodline that can be directly traced to Spain, Portugal, Italy or any combination of the three.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have a taped recording of a Spanish lecturer who explained the long ethnic and social history of Spain.  She says that it is a tradition in Spain to say that if you are Spanish, you are 1/3 Arab, 1/3 Jew / 1/3 Spanish.  And that &#8220;Spanish&#8221; is itself a combination of Iberian Celt, Roman, Vandal, Visigoth (German), Basque, Moorish (before the Arab Expansion period, Southern Spain was inhabited by North Africans and Middle Easterners from ancient times due to trade and empire).  The Pyrenees mountain range served as a natural barrier to contain these populations - mostly, until modern times.  Now even some Mexicans have settled in Spain as cheap laborers.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve traveled in Spain and lived in Europe.  The people found there tend to be different than the ones you typically find in &#8220;Latin America&#8221; with some exceptions due to colonies or periods of more modern European settlements and the sort of ethnic enclaves found in for example, Argentina and Chile.  Generalizing this stuff is always a set up to error. </p>
<p>But I cannot blame a New World Hispanic for wishing to cling to his Spanish roots, as long as they do it honor in the way they act and live. </p>

		<p>Thanks to Deniz for his always excellent  information.<br/>
 I have been in Hungary but cannot claim to  know Hungarian (said to be one of the most difficult of languages).</p>
<p>It is my unerstanding that the Hungarian nation is composed of three groups:  The Magyars, the Szekeley, and the Saxons. </p>
<p>Most of those Saxons came in to settle during the early Middle Ages; to be precise  they were Bavarians more than Saxons.  But it is little known that long before them, the defeated Anglo-Saxon court and army fled to Europe, traveling from place to place, an angry army nervously received and not too welcome, until they found refuge and settled in Hungary. There, they were welcomed by the king of Hungary, given lands,  and  intermarried with the Hungarian nobility to became part of the Hungarian nation. </p>
<p>Later, their descendents married into Norwegian and  Scottish royalty and eventually found their way back into the English ruling family once again.   It might have been Margaret.  Margaret, an extremely common name in the British Isles, especially Scotland, actually came there from Hungary. There is today a Margaret Island in Budapest.   There are to this day some Scottish noble  families who descend from those Hungarians courtiers who returned to Britain.  Sorry, I cannot offhand think of the names without some detailed  research. It&rsquo;s quite fascinating how history came full circle.</p>

<p>The majority of cubans are of partical european descent. Those that are exlusively of Euro descent are a tiny minority. A similar argument applies to all of south/central america. Gene scans do not lie. Argentina, touted as 90% white, is really only 40% white by gene analysis. If they were 90% white, they would have steamrolled the brits in the Falklands war by virtue of better organization, better industrial infrastructure, better soldiers etc etc. Instead they got clobbered. Argentina is an economic and political basket case like all other third world majority nations. You americans should take heed and realize that this is what awaits you unless you manage to form and hold all white enclaves. </p>

<p>She is a saint because she was instrumental in bringing the celtic church of scotland to acknowledge the Pope as supreme ruler of scottish christianity, Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>500 years later the Scots protestants such as John Knox did not appreciate her.  They loathed her because they claimed that the pre 1100 Scots church was pure christianity that St. Margaret polluted with the anti christ scarlet woman of Rome.</p>

Furthermore, the carrying capacity of the scandinavian countries are limited because of the harsh winters. Living in a shantytown in Sweden during wintertime is neither easy nor fun. In the warm mediterranian nations its possible to live a decent life (as in not freezing to death) in a shantytown during wintertime. This is why southern Europe is doomed. Add to this that the visual (and genetic) differences between fair haired, blue eyed nordics and swarthy, dark haired and eyed minor asians/north africans are much larger than between swarthy, dark eyed italians/greek/spaniards and the same. Simply put, if a kurd can pass as an italian or spaniard, just how easy will it be to root him out? </p>

<p>If it isnt asian or black, its white. This are official FBI descriptions based on offical US census criteria. </p>
<p>American census statistics overstate the amount of white people in USA by a very large margin. I would say that people with european only ancestry (and Í mean native euros, not transnational migrant minority groups like tartars, gypsies or jews) are a minority in the USA, and of these, most are not of north european ancestry. USA is basically mediterranian europe mixed with middle east, africa and latin america with a sprinkling of asians, ranging from west to east, thrown in. </p>

<p>&#8220;The &ldquo;whites&rdquo; you list in Southern Europe look the way they do due to increasing Arab and Turkish genetic drift.&#8221; [sic]</p>
<p>First, I recommend you look up the definition of the term &#8220;genetic drift&#8221; since you used it incorrectly.</p>
<p>http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/g/genetic_drift.htm</p>
<p>Second, one of the great myths of Nordicists is that Southern Europeans in ancient times looked a lot more like Northern Europeans than they do today.  I have never seen any credible physical evidence to support that contention.</p>

To 38  &mdash;  Godefroy de Bouillon:</p>
<p>Italic peoples (there are more than one) were never very numerous on this continent prior to the establishment of the U.S.A.  However, they did play a part in the exploration of North America.  The great French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who explored the entire Mississippi River basin for France, admitted he could not have done it were it not for his best friend and right hand man, Henri de Tonti (real name: Enrico Tonti), the &#8220;Father of Arkansas&#8221;.  Historians are at odds over whether de Tonti was Neapolitan or Sicilian.</p>
<p>http://www.al.com/specialreport/mobileregister/tri-02-24-2.html</p>
<p>Henri de Tonty&rsquo;s younger brother was Alphonse de Tonty, who was one of the founders of the city of Detroit.</p>
