<p>To create racially and culturally diverse neighborhoods, the university [Michigan State] uses a round-robin format to place first-year students in residence halls, but disproportionate racial representation has remained an issue, said Amy Franklin-Craft, the associate director of the Department of Residence Life.</p>
<p>According to enrollment numbers provided by the Office of Planning and Budgets in the 2011 Data Digest, 73 percent of undergraduate students identified themselves as white, 7 percent identified themselves as African-American/black, 4 percent identified themselves as Asian and 3 percent identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino.</p>
<p>However, based on data from the Department of Residence Life in the World 2010.pdf, very few residence halls have a racial makeup similar to the university averages, leaving many wondering whether the imbalance is a result of student choice or institutional bias.</p>
<p><strong>Bridging the gap</strong></p>
<p>When interdisciplinary studies in social science senior Devin Evans moved into Hubbard Hall as a freshman in fall 2008, he joined the hall with the second highest percentage of black students. In 2008, 29 percent of the students in Hubbard were black, trailing only Butterfield Hall, where 38 percent of the students were black, both halls well above the university average.</p>
<p>Evans, who is black, said he has heard residence halls receive nicknames because of the racial makeup of the students they house, such as Brody Complex Neighborhood being referred to as &#8220;the Brojects.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although finding it comforting to be around a large number of students from a similar background, after two years in Hubbard, Evans knew he needed a change.</p>
<p>The following year, he moved into Snyder Hall, where, combined with Phillips Hall, 76 percent of the students were white  &mdash;  25 percent higher than the percentage of white students in Hubbard his first year  &mdash;  and became an intercultural aide.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This year, Evans is an intercultural aide in Wilson Hall and said encouraging students to interact with people from other racial and ethnic backgrounds has been a difficult process.</p>
<p>Evans said the intercultural aides in Wilson and Holden Halls are working together to hold a variety of intercultural events as a way to bring students together.</p>
<p>&#8220;(In) both places, it has been very difficult getting people to break people off from their shell of friends,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have to have intercultural events to allow people to interact with other people because they probably wouldn&rsquo;t do it by themselves. It helps to bridge the gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Franklin-Craft said before 2009, incoming freshmen were allowed to request their residence hall, which she believes resulted in self-segregation.</p>
<p>Although the numbers have improved slightly after the change, Franklin-Craft said MSU still isn&rsquo;t where it needs to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was absolutely a self-segregation that was happening across campus,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Students coming into Michigan State may not have had that experience of working with students from other backgrounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to break the pattern of segregation, Darden said the university must create a policy of integration, in which each residence hall represents the university&rsquo;s racial average.</p>
<p>Without this policy, Darden said students will continue to perpetuate the divided living experiences they learned as children because it&rsquo;s the only experience they&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowledge is what a university is supposed to present to students, and knowledge comes in different forms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s clear if they don&rsquo;t do it the outcome is segregation and the outcome will be students are no different than when they came in. &hellip; That&rsquo;s a price the university pays. That&rsquo;s a choice.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Kids at that age tend to be quite liberal, depending on what the racial makeup of their home communities looked like. Since this is in Michigan, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet that lots of these White kids came from metropolitan areas like Milwaukee, Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Lansing, Flint Chicago, etc..The outer suburbs and possibly many old rust belt inner ring blue collar suburbs. Most of the blacks probably came from those cities proper. Most of the black schools are most likely run by corrupt politicians, civic leaders, unscrupulous schoolboard members, and the list goes on. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that there is no corruption in the White school districts but I do believe that racially aware Whites who want their kids to succeed will make big sacrifices for them to do just that. I&rsquo;m so grateful my parents made those sacrifices. My wife will make the same choices to put our daughter into a good school. I will do my best to teach my daughter that being around others who look like her is NOT A CRIME.<br>

<p>Just yesterday, we got a story on AR about a border town Texas college campus that was &#8220;successful&#8221; in teaching Hispanics precisely because it was overwhelmingly Hispanic.  In fact, the article stated that &#8220;A campus climate that values and validates their culture&#8221; was why.</p>

		<p>We endorse this forced integration. Look at what HUD is doing to Westchester County, NY, and what &#8220;civil rights icon and leader&#8221; Joseph Lowery and the Ga. Black Caucus is doing to &#8220;too White&#8221; Sandy Springs.  </p>
<p>The blacks who run government are forcing the breakup of Whiteness, and since there is nothing we can do to stop it, the best for White students it to learn how to best endure the Diversity Curse as they can.  The sooner they get the forced treatment, the better.  We hope they don&rsquo;t complain or draw attention to themselves, are forced underground into secret segregation societies, and find creative means of holding the White college administrators accountable to their own unearned White privileges.   </p>
<p>The current phase of the horror requires new tactics from us.  The appearance of surrender has its place.  Deception is a legitimate tactic.  Demanding that the unmentionable tribe integrate their own social and religious institutions will be the most fun.</p>

<p>It may also socialize him so that he may get an affirmative action job among whites, post-graduation.</p>

<p>Wealthy, talented, accomplished (&#8220;too privileged&#8221;) White merit students must sacrifice more to make Sewanee more welcoming and inclusive of all.</p>

Lee Ann Afton, dean of admission for The University of the South, said the school decided to lower merit scholarships to put more money toward need-based financial aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to pull away from a lot of the merit negotiating and try to provide more aid for students who wouldn&rsquo;t afford it otherwise,&#8221; she said.  </p>

		<p>So MSU is saying that they are forcing people to experience and accept diversity in order to further a social agenda for society as a whole.</p>
<p>This&hellip;makes&hellip;me&hellip;so&hellip;mad!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the purpose of a college to educate people in a particular field of study that they select, such as engineering, science or theatre?</p>
<p>Leftists and their cultural marxism seek to destroy any majority white areas, anywhere, all because they worship at the alter of &#8216;diversity&rsquo;, and they think that there&rsquo;s a kumbaya rainbow, social justice utopia just around the corner, if they can only FORCE people to live beyond their comofort zone.  </p>
<p>It is all a lie and never worked anywhere, even in communist countries who were the most preachy about equality of all, but who did some of the worst atrocities against other ethnic groups.</p>

		<p>Just leave us alone!  Black, White, Asian, whatever&hellip;just leave us alone to choose our friends, associates, neighborhoods, resident halls, etc.  Race relations would improve ten-fold if these busybodies just tended their own garden, stopped meddling and left us all alone.  Even Muhammad Ali was against all of this forced integration.  If it&rsquo;s real and organic, fine; but nothing of lasting value will be achieved by fiat.  All of this only creates resentment and further bad relations between the races.</p>

<p>In their shell? Of course he is talking about White students only.</p>
<p>Bridge the gap through persuasion and force is what he really means. We see what has happened in our schools and in society when we &#8220;bridge those gaps&#8221;, have we not? Whites become the victims over and again and people like this guy wants them to feel &#8220;guilty&#8221; for not integrating even more with those who prey on them. Lord, will they ever stop with this insanity and our genocide?</p>

		<p>Black men had no shyness about socializing with White women when I was in college.  They swarmed like hyenas to a dead deer.</p>
<p>When I was in college I avoided the black men like the plague.<br>
I had no special opinion about blacks till the first week of college waiting in line in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>I heard some black male students talking about sex.  It was totally vulgar and disgusting.  They leched around of course, but I avoided them like the plague they are.</p>
<p>Black men never have problems socializing with White women in colleges.  Best way to avoid them is to keep your head down, eyes on the ground and your hair falling all over your face.<br>
Don&rsquo;t talk to them.  If you do they will never leave you alone.</p>
<p>I have a boyfriend, I&rsquo;m married doesn&rsquo;t work at all with black men. Never talk to them.  Luckily affirmative action has replaced all the black men with black women in the workplace so vile disgusting lechery is not much of a problem once college ends.</p>
<p>One would think American colleges have reproduced Mao&rsquo;s curriculum.  Actaully, I think they have.</p>

		<p>I went to MSU.  The reason why blacks are so segregated is simple.  They don&rsquo;t take any legitimate classes. There are a number of fake classes with no work and no standards that are near 100% black.  The only contact I had with blacks was wondering why they kept taking over the administration building in various protests.  The administration went out of its way to try and meet their desires.  The main problem seemed to be getting them to articulate them.  They claimed the college was &#8220;racist&#8221; but never said what the specific behaviors were or changes they want made.  Probably, what was meant was they wanted free money out of the university for various things.</p>

		<p>Why stop at forcing diversity by race mixing? Think of all the other possibilities of mixing. You can break up dating couples to force more variety in dating. Make it a problem for students to be fans of a sport like football; get them to watch volleyball or badminton. Conventional hetero sexuality needs to be made a problem to encourage students to explore gay sex. Afterall how can students know they aren&rsquo;t gay unless they experiment with it? Campus religious groups will only be open to students who are exploring other religions. Only non-Christians can join a Christian group and Christian students can only join non-Christian groups. </p>
<p>We have to do something with students who continue in university with something they were good at in high school. A good high school science student would be required to become a liberal arts major. And a high school basketball star would not be allowed onto the college basketball team. We have to do something about good looking students enhancing their attractiveness. To experience looking homely, attractive students will not be allowed to wear makeup or trendy clothes.</p>
<p>We need a college motto. How about &#8220;dare to be different&#8221;?<br>

		<p>It is probably safe to say that </p>
<p>*Fraternity and sorority men and women associate with one another. </p>
<p>*Athletes associate with one another.</p>
<p>*Gay and Lesbian students associate with one another </p>
<p>*Disabled and other students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Lower Income Students Associte with one another</p>
<p>* Religous Students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Conservative Students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Liberal Students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Unattractive or socially awkward Students associate with one another</p>
<p>and yes, students of similar racial backgrounds tend to associate with one another.  </p>
<p>Human beings tend to be tribal and it is not always confined to race. </p>
<p>You are going to always find some people who deviate from this pattern, but most people will decide to stay within their comfort zones. It&rsquo;s that simple.<br>

		<p>There is one revolution where conservative forces could win. I&rsquo;m surprised the battle in universites with diversity fascism has lasted this long. What else is a university beside being conservative? The young come to the old for instruction. The old might pick up some fresh ideas from the young but the serious big money stuff goes from old to young. So why are university conservatives not defeating the enemy? Possibly neo-con influence. But worse is lack of good rhetoric from the conservative theory guys. To mobilize the ideas guys, activists need to create events that weaken diversity fascism. We have to drag the ideas guys along behind. They aren&rsquo;t doing their job. </p>

		<p>A FRESH IDEA FOR RACE REALISTS:</p>
<p>How about we stop being outraged (isn&rsquo;t five days of outrage a week a bit much?) How about we ACCEPT that yes, the marxist world IS THAT LOONY. Yes, the government hates us that much. Yes, forty million third world slunks are here to eat our lunch if we give it to them.<br>
But Nobody needs to  roll over. <br>
Try a LITTLE BIT of honesty visa-vis race, out in public; not a fatal dose; just make a totally truthful, carefree statement once in awhile, to STUN your friends and associates. <br>
 If someone asks your opinion, GIVE IT TO THEM. Let them pee their pants. You just act like you commented on the weather. Put THEM in the mindset where they have to question reality, and look for an alternative, more functional view (Did john jones really just say, blithely, that people, especially whites naturally want to be among their own kind? Did I hear that right? what should i say; what should I do; I&rsquo;m really flustered. I gotta&rsquo; go sit down&#8221;).<br>
Seriously, If you hand your average half- asleep white some honest opinion on race, you will actually shake them up. Believe me, they will have to bring it up at dinner later. It will flit through their mind as they try to fall asleep. They will be neck - deep in anxiety, outrage, or just plain disorganization about it the next morning.<br>
We have VERY powerful, if subtle weapons at our disposal. Since cognitive dissonance runs close to the surface in the majority of smart Marxist whites, we can REALLY toy with their thoughts and emotions, with merely a pleasantly voiced opinion or set of facts now and then.<br>
Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m joking, I&rsquo;m totally serious. They are all VERY vulnerable for a  dizzying turn of the tables now. But we should NOT think that this means protests, and anything overt. No, your simple (and occasoinal) honesty is enough to chip away at their brains. Imagine if tomorrow, one million white men and women of racial integrity, just said ONE THING true about race. Not inflammatory. Just gave their opinion to a friend or co worker or acquaintance. By day&rsquo;s end, two or three, maybe TEN million people would be involved in the mental turmoil of the original audience. </p>
<p>We CAN change our world for the better, and sooner than you think. And we need to drop this desperate grumbling. <br>
Try what I suggested. You&rsquo;ll be amazed.</p>

		<p>I graduated from East Stroudsburg State College (now University) in Pennsylvania about 30 years ago and this nonsense was happening even THEN. While I worked three jobs to pay my tuition and expenses, blacks from inner-city Philly and Camden were given free rides and spending money just to matriculate and increase the school&rsquo;s &#8220;diversity&#8221;. End result? They cut all their classes, spent their days in the game room or snack shop, and then quit when the winter snows came and the campus got too bleak for them to endure. I watched in silent fury, and I got an education, all right. When I went back to visit ESU several summers ago, I found the place over-run with loud-mouthed, trash-talkin&rsquo; brothas and sistas. I&rsquo;m so glad I returned. It has saved me a bundle in contributions to the alumni fund.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The following year, he moved into Snyder Hall, where, combined with Phillips Hall, 76 percent of the students were white &mdash; 25 percent higher than the percentage of white students in Hubbard his first year &mdash; and became an intercultural aide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would it be too cynical to say that &#8220;intercultural aide&#8221; is the government funded word for &#8220;pimp?&#8221;<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m still trying to understand why &#8220;self-segregation&#8221; is a bad thing. And also, what in the name of all that is good and holy is an interculural aide? </p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more! As a matter of fact, I find it completely impossible NOT to voice my opinion these days. The one thing I really need to work on though is keeping my anger in check when talking about racial issues. My goal is to get them thinking, no matter how much they may disagree with me. Just plant a little seed and see where it leads them. </p>

<p>Look up the history of the English Catholics.  It was a criminal offense for 300 years to be a Catholic.  The anglicans thought the religion had been stamped out.  When Catholicism was decriminalized, it turned out that 25 percent of the peers of the realm including several Dukes were Catholics whose families had preserved the religion for 300 years.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for us to go underground.</p>

It is probably safe to say that </p>
<p>*Fraternity and sorority men and women associate with one another. </p>
<p>*Athletes associate with one another.</p>
<p>*Gay and Lesbian students associate with one another </p>
<p>*Disabled and other students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Lower Income Students Associte with one another</p>
<p>* Religous Students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Conservative Students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Liberal Students associate with one another</p>
<p>* Unattractive or socially awkward Students associate with one another</p>
<p>and yes, students of similar racial backgrounds tend to associate with one another. </p>
<p>Human beings tend to be tribal and it is not always confined to race. </p>
<p>You are going to always find some people who deviate from this pattern, but most people will decide to stay within their comfort zones. It&rsquo;s that simple.</p>

<p>Brilliantly put.  We must talk about it honestly and sincerely.  Since it&rsquo;s not yet Orwell&rsquo;s &#8220;1984&#8221; and we still have some language left that&rsquo;s not &#8220;newspeak&#8221;, let&rsquo;s dare to be open and frank.  </p>
<p>I have a lot of contact with the public each week in a social capacity, and if someone brings race or politics up, I speak out.  Since I am also in a very young, liberal area, it tends to be quite fun to have twenty years of experience and street smarts on them, and our conversations can last quite long.  The most fun comes when you see the sweat break out on their foreheads.  Some quit and walk away while others sit and talk for hours, trying their damnedest to prove me wrong or at least delusional. The names I am called!  (It starts with, &#8220;you&rsquo;re a staunch Republican, aren&rsquo;t you?&#8221; or &#8220;you&rsquo;re just a greedy white Southerner, born of privilege&#8221;, or even, &#8220;aha, I see  &mdash;  -you&rsquo;re racist&#8221; and winds up with, &#8220;Wow.  I see your point.  I may not agree with all of what you say, but I have really enjoyed speaking with you.  You&rsquo;re so intelligent!&#8221;), as if they&rsquo;ve been taught all their lives that conservative or independent thinkers are all closed-minded and stupid.  </p>
<p>It will take each one of us going out there in the world and speaking our minds because it&rsquo;s one of the few freedoms we have left.  If we don&rsquo;t use it, we will lose it.</p>

		<p>Hey Lefties!  Whites are very close to breaching the less that 50% of the population mark.  You have pretty much won the enchilada!  Did I say enchilada!  </p>
<p>Oh yeah, now you have 50 million, recently arrived latinos to play God with.  Think of the possibilities!  You can mix latinos with blacks, or how about blacks with chinese?  What about somalis and koreans?  That would be a grand mix!  Fight to end self-segregation of asian immigrants by moving in LOTS of blacks.  You can build section 8 buildings and projects right in the heart of every chinatown across the land!</p>
<p>What about mixing armenians with hmongs!  Or jews and arabs!  All living together in a happy brotherhood of peace, equality of wealth and social justice!</p>
<p>How &#8216;bout it?</p>
<p>Until you get that to work out, please lay off the heat on us dwindling white folks.  We&rsquo;re really weak these days and may not be able to provide a steady stream of blond girls for the bruthas and idealistic college students ready for brainwashing.</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch!</p>

		<p>This is all about training Whitey for the future.</p>
<p>Institutionalize diversity and inclusion through more forced integration.  Those Whiteys who go along with the program will not be given &#8220;hate demerits&#8221; on their records. </p>
<p>Those who do resist will have their &#8220;hate&#8221; put in their permanent records that will go out with their transcripts to graduate schools and employers.</p>
<p>Obviously, any student who doesn&rsquo;t embrace Diversity and Inclusion is a racist hater, and should be punished like one.  </p>
<p>How many times to you read stories that are complaints against &#8220;systemic bias and institutional racism&#8221;?  All these forced integration programs are designed to address those problems.   They will overturn systemic bias against blacks by implementing systemic bias in favor of blacks, and institutional racism against Whites will become institutionalized.  </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this is all about, and no Whiteys are complain about it, because they have the Diversity Fear:</p>

		<p>The university of California campuses are overwhelmingly asian.</p>
<p>A couple times a year some asian PC crew, usually female starts this kind of thing.  Look at the dining rooms, koreans sitting with koreans, taiwanese with taiwanese, thais with thais, northern chinese with northern chines, cantonese with cantonese.</p>
<p>Horrors we must mix everybody up.  They are always asian girls in those ridiculous sociology stupidology dumbology feminist classes.</p>

		<p>Looks like some white kids are going to become victims. I just read an article that stated interacial births have went up 32% in the past 10 years. I have not and will not ever encourage my sons to date or have a relationship outside our race. If these people want to live outside their own culture let them do so. But please do not come back and cry about the poor treatment they recieved.</p>
