			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Alanah Eriksen, Daily Mail (London), September 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s been rumoured for a while now that Idris Elba is set to become the next James Bond.</p>
<p>And the hunky British actor and sometime-singer will excite millions of female fans out there after admitting he would &#8216;definitely consider&rsquo; the role.</p>
<p>He said the it was &#8216;a very old rumour&rsquo; that he had been asked to play special agent 007.</p>
<p>But producers might come running when they hear how committed he is to his work.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old, who hails from Hackney, in North London, revealed he&rsquo;d pull a stunt worthy of the role.</p>
<p>&#8216;If Sony decided to call me and said hey, we wanted to do [James Bond], I&rsquo;d definitely consider it,&rsquo; he told U.S. radio station NPR.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;d not only get in the cab, but I&rsquo;d take the taxi driver out of the car, hostage, jump out while it was moving, jump onto a pedal bike that was just past the door as I got on it, and then get onto a plane  &mdash;  on the wing  &mdash;  and land on top of Sony Studios, slide through the air conditioning, and land in the office.</p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m never shaken or stirred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Idris said he hoped fans would look past his race and concentrate on his acting skills.</p>
<p>&#8216;My Dad and I were talking about this the other day because he said &#8216;You could do it, would you do it?&rsquo; I was like &#8216;Yeah, I would do it, but I just don&rsquo;t want to be called the first black James Bond&rsquo;. Do you understand what I &#8216;m saying?</p>
<p>&#8216;Sean Connery wasn&rsquo;t the Scottish James Bond and Daniel Craig wasn&rsquo;t the blue-eyed James Bond.</p>
<p>&#8216;So if I played him, I don&rsquo;t want to be called the black James Bond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actor is best known for playing best known for playing drug baron Stringer Bell on HBO hit The Wire.</p>
<p>He says he didn&rsquo;t define the character as a black drug dealer.</p>
<p>&#8216;I didn&rsquo;t come to America to play black roles. I came to America to play roles. And Stringer Bell, being my first character, was a smart drug dealer. In my opinion, he&rsquo;s black, but that&rsquo;s not the point.</p>
<p>&#8216;The point is, this is a man who&rsquo;s caught between two worlds. And that complex balance he&rsquo;s in, is what made the drama.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actor is already busy with his detective series Luther which has just been snapped up for a third series.</p>
<p>He told The Sun: &#8216;I was blown away by the reaction to series two. People really got on board and getting an Emmy nomination for Luther is the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>&#8216;We&rsquo;re looking at returning with some equally great storylines and characters  &mdash;  and hopefully an Emmy award.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Idris, you are not James Bond, and regardless of whether or not you are ever cast as him, you will never be a true James Bond. James Bond is White. Just like Heimdall.</p>
<p>Blacks and their white race-traitor apologists think that blacks playing White characters is a sign of black superiority. On the contrary, it is a sign of black inferiority. The black man cannot come up with interesting, memorable characters of his own, so he has to steal the White man&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>This nonsense about a black playing Bond predictably pops up almost every year with a different actor mentioned. Leave it to the Afrocentric CNN to run with a story most likely dreamed up by this actor&rsquo;s press agent. If CNN actually bothered to check their facts they would have learned that Daniel Craig just got signed up for another two Bonds not including &#8220;Bond 23&#8221; which he just started filming. Absolute rubbish&hellip; </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a huge Bond fan (Sean Connery to me will always be the best Bond.) but if this happens, I&rsquo;m done with the franchise. James Bond is a British Secret Service agent. The character was created in 1953 and as far as I know, Blacks were immigrating to the U.K. but not in a huge number. So, to stay true to the storyline, is it possible that a Black man would be a Secret Service agent? Perhaps. But highly improbable.</p>
<p>I am tired of seeing Black actors and actresses fill roles that have a historical significance or traditional reference that is associated with a White person. If a movie is made about a scientist and he was White, then use a White actor. I can&rsquo;t remember who said this but someone remarked, &#8220;You know, putting a Black person in a White role doesn&rsquo;t make sense. It&rsquo;s not like the two are interchangeable.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Black man playing Bond would taint the flavor of Bond. The suaveness and womanizing traits would be seen in the worst stereotypical way. So would the use of weaponry and fist-fighting. The whole imagery and mystique of Bond would be off-kilter.</p>
<p>I wish Hollywood would stop cannibalizing traditional roles and just start creating new ones for Blacks. But I suspect they&rsquo;re afraid if they did that, not as many would crowd the theaters.</p>

<p><br>
In your OPINION he&rsquo;s black? I&rsquo;m familiar with the ludicrous contention that race is just a social construct   &mdash;   but now they&rsquo;re trying to convince us it&rsquo;s a matter of opinion?</p>
<p>But I agree with Mr. Elba about this much: I don&rsquo;t want him being known as &#8220;the black James Bond&#8221; either. In fact, I don&rsquo;t want a black James Bond at all. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure Bond creator Ian Fleming wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted one either. Fleming kept a place in Jamaica, where he apparently developed a rather dim view of the locals   &mdash;   an attitude that comes through strongly in the 1973 film of &#8220;Live and Let Die&#8221;, which was set in the Caribbean and which portrays blacks as drug dealers and voodoo wackos, in ways that are quite &#8220;racist&#8221; by today&rsquo;s standards. </p>

		<p>So would all the &#8220;Bond Girls&#8221; still be white, or would they be black?</p>
<p>If they stayed white, black women would be angry.  If they became black, then it would be a &#8216;black&rsquo; movie and most whites would not be interested, even liberals, who love to go to their indie, all-white movies about hipsters, drugs and easy sex.</p>
<p>The Bond movies usually feature Bond fighting some European bad guys, whether commies, evil geniuses or secret organizations.  How would a black Bond be able to go undercover in a white world?  Or would they make the bad guys black too?  Then it would still be a black film that few would see.</p>

		<p>I think either Ewan Magregor, Daniel Radcliff, or Colin Firth should be the new James Bond.  </p>
<p>With a voice coach, why not have an American actor like Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp as the new James Bond?  With a voice coach it still would not be out of place, as long as a white American actor did a good impression of a British accent.</p>
<p>But there is no way that a black actor should be the new James Bond.</p>
<p>To have a black actor play James Bond is just as out of place as having a young white actor like Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint, or Josh Hutcherson play, in a remake of the 1977 &#8220;Roots&#8221; mini-series, the role of Kunta Kinte!</p>

These blacks are definitly not original, they are worse than the chinese, even in copying other peoples ideas and culture. The question is: can a black sing opera?   Their palates are not shaped like the white mans&rsquo;. Their palates are high, narrow and they have more teeth than the whites. The whites&rsquo; palate is shallow and wider to the rear, thus the voice resonates differently in the black as in the white. Especially in the black sopranos the voices sound shrill and hollow. It is obvious that the music was not composed for their type of voices.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s WAY too much money to be made from the Bond franchise for the producers to risk hundreds of millions of dollars by casting a minority actor. I actually thought he (Elba) was very good as Heimdall in the Thor movie. As to the controversy over his casting in that- it was ridiculously over the top superhero fluff, very much a comic book brought to life - bearing almost no relation to the mythical  characters on which it was based. Racially aware white people should perhaps think about picking their battles a little more carefully. Sheila Jackson Lee, for example, is a public figure  who would be much more worthy of attention, given how racist she is and the fact that she is in a position of power. </p>

		<p>In a world in which the courts of Henry VIII, and the mythical King Arthur are as replete with non-white extras as the cast of Porgy and Bess, anything is possible.<br>
James Bond has long ceased to be a genuine character, and the connection between Ian Fleming&rsquo;s Anglo-Swiss literary creation and his screen persona was severed many years ago. The inevitable selection of a non-white actor will merely be the coup-de grace for a meaningless franchise that has already outlived its usefulness.</p>

		<p>This ridiculous nonsense has been going on for years in England, with black actors in Robin Hood or King Arthur stories but also as English kings in Shakespeare plays! The anachronism fools no-one except ignorant and indoctrinated white schoolchildren.   Why not a black Iago and an Inuit Othello?   Antony Sher has just announced that Jewish actors should not be cast(automatically) as Jews, although he made a perfect Disraeli.  Perhaps we should put a Congolese Forest Person in the role of Shylock, Pickwick, Nelson, Hereward the Wake, Max Schmeling &c; - but why not on this &#8220;logic&#8221;? <br>
Coming soon, a black Poirot, Marple, Holmes, Columbo&hellip;? Who would think of casting Alexander McCall Smith&rsquo;s black lady detective with a white actress? The truth, of course, is that agreeable black actors like Morgan Freeman can play positive heroes of their own kind.   <br>
The real motive behind all this &#8220;offensive&#8221; nonsense hardly needs to be spelled out to Amren supporters. </p>

		<p>Things are really going from bad to worse.  This is a case of a culture&rsquo;s icons being changed or moved to identify with the new population.  Similar to how the Christians built their churches on ancient pagan sites to make the new religion more palatable to the pagans.  It&rsquo;s just a matter of time unless white people stop participating in their own destruction.  I wonder what will happen.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right.  In fact only two Englishmen; Roger Moore and Daniel Craig, have ever played Bond.  George Lazenby is Australian,Timothy Dalton Welsh, and Sean Connery an Irish descended Scotsman.  The literary character was originally born of an English father and a French-Swiss mother, but in the wake of Sean Connery&rsquo;s seminal portrayal in Dr No, Ian Fleming gave Bond a Scottish make-over in his next novel: &#8220;On Her Majesty&rsquo;s Secret Service&#8221;. He must be turning in his grave.</p>

		<p>You can bet your bottom dollar that the &#8220;Bond girls&#8221; will definitely be White. It would fit perfectly with the race mixing propaganda that you see everywhere  &mdash;  black men and white women in commercials, billboards, now hiring ads, etc&hellip; I am not in the least surprised by this.

		<p>They should make a 007 movie with this guy as James Bond.  Except it could be like he is an AA, diversity hire.  He could screw up missions due to low IQ and lack of proper training, drug use etc.  Get caught betraying his country to a russian communist handler (like in real life).  Kill the wrong people.</p>
<p>Casino Royale was a remake of a bond movie that was originally a comedy.  I say it&rsquo;s time for a new Bond movie comedy.</p>

		<p>Us white people are expected (if indeed it happens) to sit back and cop this rubbish. A large proportion of us probably would.<br>
Could you imagine if there was a new &#8216;Shaft&rsquo; movie in the works with Brad pitt in the lead role? Maybe a hoax could be started and we could sit back, relax and observe the hysterical hoo-hah!<br>
The liberal media would have their collective panties in a major jumble!<br>
As a side note, and this is my very &#8216;subjective&rsquo; opinion (which I&rsquo;m entitled to) looking at the above photo of Mr Elba he looks a bit dopey and certainly not suave at all. </p>

		<p>Posters seem willing to make deals with the movie studios: &#8220;Just let us keep James Bond and we&rsquo;ll keep buying tickets and renting videos.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like saying that if only an all-White team were allowed to exist, college sports would be OK.</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t let you keep James Bond. They will trash him because they need to demoralize you. A black James Bond is inevitable. Hollywood will do this and more. In a few years the character will be played by a black or brown woman. </p>
<p>There is no limit to those people&rsquo;s ability to trash White icons and Western civilization. They can&rsquo;t help themselves. All they require is time to sink lower, and the money you give them. </p>

		<p>I watched exactly one of the James Bond movies with Daniel Craig playing the role of Bond, after having lost complete interest in the entire series after one particularly awful and cartoonish performance by Roger Moore in this role.   Craig&rsquo;s portrayal of Bond was awful; what Craig did was churn out another one of the endless &#8216;action&rsquo; movies which Hollywood seems to never tire of making, where 95% of the stunts and special effects are so unbelievable and unrealistic that one would have to be a complete imbecile to consider any of them to be possible.    In Craig&rsquo;s Bond film, the character he played could have been anyone - he did NOT even try to emulate the &#8216;Bond persona&rsquo; or &#8216;Bond style&rsquo;, aside from the standard fetish about how he preferred his martinis.  </p>
<p>After I&rsquo;d seen that one Craig film, I saw an article in the UK press where Craig said that he would just LOVE to see a black playing the James Bond role someday.   At that point, I made my mind up - I would see no more James Bond movies that starred Daniel Craig, Mr. Ultimate Race Traitor.</p>
<p>Listen up, fellow AR readers and white race realists.   We have to stop subsidizing white movie actors or actresses who show the tip of their middle finger to their own race of people.    </p>

		<p>The Wire was one of the best American series ever made, but my some sort of accident-it showed the truth about Black America, as if this truth would somehow win sympathy for Black America. A few of the black children and black police were likeable, like Bunny, the Western District police captain, and the boy whose family was killed when his friends fire-bombed his house. But Idris Elba&rsquo;s Stringer Bell was a despicable opportunist that he could play effectively because that&rsquo;s the type of person he is. The only competent actors in the show were Dominic West as Jimmy McNulty and the wicked, white deputy police chief Rawls, played by John Doman. Idris Elba couldn&rsquo;t act; like most of the cast he just played himself-he&rsquo;s no James Bond; just a loud-mouthed parvenu who lords it over his less well-informed but suspicious underlings.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;Casino Royale was a remake of a bond movie that was originally a comedy. I say it&rsquo;s time for a new Bond movie comedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Big conflicts here behind the scenes.<br>
The first Casino Royale was indeed a spoof about the secret agent genre<br>
The male version of Modesty Blaise which also appeared at about the same time.</p>
<p>The original Bond franchise later managed to acquire the film rights to the book and produced the current Daniel Craig version of the story</p>
<p>For me the most realistic and believable fight scene in any Bond movie was Sean Connery fighting for his life against the Spectre/Smersh assassin Robert Shaw on the Orient Express in From Russia with Love. Also the gadgets were very limited but came in handy when Connery finally garroted Robert Shaw with a cable that came out of his wrist watch. Great stuff!</p>
<p>Doe anyone know how to contact the Bond film makers?<br>
Send them this story and comments thread to end any foolish notions of a black James Bond.</p>
<p>Lord have mercy - the next thing we will have is a black Santa Claus in animal skins.  </p>

		<p>Oh, Sean Connery&hellip; I&rsquo;ll stop drooling now.</p>
<p>Who-dra WHO-Bis?? Seriously? Imagining the Bond scenes with a black man makes one&rsquo;s skin crawl.</p>
<p>On a related note, I saw advertisements over the weekend of a re-make of &#8216;Footloose&rsquo; replete with the popular black male student and hooker-looking students dirty dancing to funky rap-style music.  </p>
<p>Yeessir, there&rsquo;s a REASON I don&rsquo;t watch current TV series&rsquo; or movies. </p>

<p>&#8220;You can bet your bottom dollar that the &ldquo;Bond girls&rdquo; will definitely be White. It would fit perfectly with the race mixing propaganda that you see everywhere &mdash; black men and white women in commercials, billboards, now hiring ads, etc&hellip; I am not in the least surprised by this. The elites of this world just keep on dismantling everything that is normal and right and pervert them to their own twisted view of how the world should be.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am beginning to alter this, your stated view above with a new possibility that dovetails fairly well with the idea of anti-white violence new suppression.  Some of that Utopian, mixed race future is part of it, but also there is  a fear component.  The media wants to use blacks like Morgan Freeman and the image of righteous blacks fighting crime, heroes, etc., because there is a HUGE fear of an awakened white majority.  Everything is being done to prevent this awakening. I read CNN posting boards when certain news stories are printed and it seems that an awful lot of people are waking up. </p>
<p>Am I alone, or are all of you readers noticing how outlandish and obvious this is becoming? </p>

<p>So true! I&rsquo;ve just been watching the series <em>Camelot</em>, which is loosely based on the Arthurian legend. There are many black actors in this production. One scene that struck me as unusual was a knight escorting a black, female servant into the compound of Camelot. The knight was walking and the servant was on horseback sending the message that the servant was superior. I have studied C. S. Lewis&rsquo;s concepts of courtly love, but this scene was ridiculous.</p>
<p>A black James Bond is nothing new. Last year, Jamie Foxx stated he&rsquo;d like to play Bond. I&rsquo;ve thought, after Daniel Craig was finished with the role, the Bond role might be offered to British actor, Richard Armitage. Here is Armitage&rsquo;s IMDb listing:</p>
