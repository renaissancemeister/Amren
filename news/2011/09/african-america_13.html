Data from &#8220;The State of the African-American Consumer&#8221; indicates 44% of US African-American adults owned smartphones in Q1 2011, 22% higher than 36% among the overall population.</p>
<p>In addition, African-Americans ages 25-34 have the highest penetration rate of all (53%), followed by ages 18-24 (51%). {snip}</p>
<p><strong>African-Americans Talk on Smartphones 2X Rate of Whites</strong></p>

<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Pew: Non-Whites Text More than Whites</strong></p>
<p>Non-whites text more often than whites, according to data released by the Pew Research Center in September 2011.

		<p>I can add something to this   &mdash;   Along with talking and texting, blacks who own smartphones are more likely to live on Twitter than whites who own smartphones.  And whites tend to use the web and e-mail functionality of smartphones more than blacks.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m personally in the middle - I infrequently talk, text about as often as you would find a tooth on a hen, but I live on Twitter, and also in my phone&rsquo;s web browser.</p>

<p><i> Nielsen analysis indicates African-Americans tend to use phones primarily for talking and texting </i> </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t think that too many of them were using their phones for such things as studying nuclear physics, or even creating the next great app, for that matter. See the first point above.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a typical matter of misplaced priorities</p>

		<p>My theory is Blacks just hate silence. Whenever two or more congregate, they must start hooting, screaming and causing havoc. Even if they are by themselves often they seem to start babbling off rap lyrics or even just shouting loud nonsensical sounds. </p>
<p>Smart phones can be used to babble to friends on, or just play music or videos loudly as possible regardless of where you are, crowded bus, welfare office, school classroom etc.</p>

		<p>Signs of insecurity. The cellphone usage is to show that they have one and the constant use of it is to give the impression that they&rsquo;re so &#8220;important&#8221;. Having lived in Asia I&rsquo;ve seen people texting while talking to other people and while driving!. There&rsquo;s even a story that there was a man yakking into his cellphone when all of a sudden that cellphone rang! The constant cellphone use is one of the rudest and most shallow displays of modern life. It&rsquo;s a quintessential reflection of the superficiality of the times. And it&rsquo;s no surprise non-whites are the biggest culprits of this.</p>
<p>The funny fact about it is these people conveniently forget who created that item which they eagerly use as a crutch while hating the ones who made it a reality. No wonder they hate us so much. Any sensible white can&rsquo;t help but laugh and feel sorry for those fools.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African-Americans tend to use phones primarily for talking and texting&#8221;</p>
<p>And they use them secondarily for attracting attention by signaling to others that they are hip, rich, etc. Most of the &#8220;talking and texting&#8221; is pack-animal behavior.  If possible blacks would always mingle in groups and now smart phones have made it possible.</p>

		<p>Well I can tell you here in the midwest these so called Americans, that are African, Love texting, and being in touch wit family memmberz. new shoes (basketball)are also high on the list. You even see these girls texting at Mcdonalds and they are to be working, it has become a second job to keep up wit yo peoples. Now you know alot of this is a cricket smart phone. They might own a smartphone but they have to wait till beginin&rsquo; of da month to get dey service CUT back on. I was on a flight from Ohare to Miami in 2010, and a woman (Non anglo, &amp; hispanic)from cricket corp. was next to me typing an email, she worked for cricket, the email was all about how cricket can make the big jump and become the #1 carrier for, you guessed it, Hispanics. Viva MeHEco! These smartphones that are owned by innercity dwellers, are not always hooked up on the network. cricket offers a bridge loan to get the phone up and running. I am sorry to bash cricket, but that is a store &#8220;WE&#8221; need to stay out of due to the increase of hoootin&rsquo; and jivin&#8221;, and baby mamma drama on Saturdays.</p>

		<p>More conspicuous consumption from nature&rsquo;s ultimate consumers, who will never understand the difference between &#8220;want&#8221; and &#8220;need.&#8221; </p>
<p>True story: About 15 years ago, when mobile phones were so large they had to be carried around in a bag, I stood in an Atlanta grocery store checkout line behind a black couple who were both carrying phones. They paid for their groceries (which included steaks, of course) with foodstamps. On the other end of the spectrum, my father-in-law, a retired Fortune 500 executive, manages to participate on various state and private directorates with only an old flip phone. </p>

		<p>Near New Berlin, WI &hellip; (a city that is being sued by the justice dept.because the people/residents did not want this section eight housing) I just stopped into a Mc Donalds. All the men on phones, Mexican contractors yellin spanish into the phone. and this was a nice area in 2005. (when I was last in that area.) I was shocked the staff was all Hispanic execept the over weight female &#8220;Man - a - year&#8221;. The booths had junk and work boot kick marks. and scuffs, the soap dispenser was full of grease. in the restroom. These so called workers/contractors (illegals) sleep in a hotel. In a nice area close to the JAB&hellip; 4 or 5 guys. I see them buying beer after &#8220;trabajo&#8221;. These carpet installers do not dispose of the carpet correctly. So now you can see carpet dumped on the side of the Road. ROLLS, &hellip; Every Hispanic invader in Mcdonalds that was a man had just coffee &amp; it was raining, so the roofer Hispanics were in the Mcdonalds also. everyone of these, invaders was on a cell phone. I was in there for 40 mins. All of them yakking into those phones. yeah they look so &#8220;SMART&#8221; talking Spanish gibbberish, into a smartphone. I will not visit this Mcdonalds ever again.</p>

In the last two years, three mobile phone stores have opened in my neighborhood. T-Mobile, Cricket, and Boost Mobile.</p>
<p>Whites go to the T-Mobile, blacks and Whites go to Cricket, and the Hispanics all go to the Boost Mobile. Boost always has an Hispanic worker. I don&rsquo;t know if the Hispanic worker attracts Hispanics or if Boost Mobile hires Hispanics for this store to attract Hispanics. <br>

		<p>As a high school teacher I notice certain things that entertain children and adolescents.  New piece of technology are on full display at all times.  It is the main way teenagers draw attention to themselves.  When I was in school, this was done primarily with a cool car or trendy clothes.  That has been replaced by smart phones and i-pods.  People that flash them too frequently are starved for attention.  Jr. high kids and young high schoolers are typically starved for attention, so they flash the new &#8220;must-haves.&#8221;  For certain elements of this society, their intelligence and mental maturity PEAKS at that of a typical jr. high kid.  Mystery solved.  Statistics prove it.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to fathom what texting between blacks look like. It must be like trying to read Mandarin Chinese. They can&rsquo;t spell, they can&rsquo;t read, and combine that with texting shorthand, who in Heaven&rsquo;s name could even start to dechipher that gibberish? I&rsquo;m picturing lot&rsquo;s of &#8220;Ho&rsquo;s&#8221;, &#8220;WT, &#8220;FY&#8221; and &#8220;MFin&#8221;&hellip;</p>

		<p>Many of them are using the phones to set up a flash mob or other crimes!</p>
<p>We were in a bad area of Detroit looking at some property as part of my job and we saw a black guy looking at us and he jumped on the cell phone.  We figured he was a look-out, setting us up or whatever.  We carry guns but we got out of there to avoid trouble.  </p>
<p>I try to go into those areas before noon when everyone is still sleeping.  By afternoon, they are all sitting on the porch waiting for the mail man.   No one screws with the mail man in the hood&hellip;.he has the govt. checks!  He is safer than a cop!<br>

		<p>Having taught high school recently.  I know kids love to text and those with the mind of a child are no different. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t keep them off the phone.  It is an addiction.  I have been rear-ended twice in the past few years by young women on the phone.  </p>

		<p>It took studies to tell us this?  Anyone with eyes can simply look around at the black and hispanic population and see it.  Like other posters, it does amaze me how they can afford such an expensive and unnecessary item and its subsequent monthly fees yet depend on public assistance for housing, food, and clothing.  My boyfriend and I often remark about seeing poor blacks ride around in $500 cars with $6,000 spinner rims.  And reaching further back, I remember being outraged when my mother, who went to work full-time back in 1976, would say that only the black women at her workplace had very nice clothes, fancy cars, shoes, and handbags, yet had half a dozen kids and were always taking time off without discipline and with never having to fear for losing their positions.  </p>
<p>I think I just need to calm down and chalk it up to culture, because the poor blacks my father and cousins grew up with in south Georgia back in the 50s through 80s never acted this way, never had nor desired the finer things they couldn&rsquo;t afford, and considered the desire and obtaining of such to be patently wrong.</p>
