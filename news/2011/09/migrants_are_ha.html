			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tim Shipman, Daily Mail (London), September 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some Asian families in Britain are having too many children in order to claim extra welfare payments, Britain&rsquo;s first female Asian peer claimed last night.</p>
<p>Baroness Flather accused the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities of failing to adopt the values of British society and said they should have their benefits slashed.</p>
<p>Lady Flather, a former Tory who now sits as a crossbencher, said this abuse of the welfare system has been brushed under the carpet out of political correctness.</p>
<p>She spoke out in the House of Lords during the second reading of the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
<p>Lady Flather, a former barrister who was born in the Pakistani city of Lahore when it was part of India, praised the Indian community in the UK for having taken on &#8216;the pattern&rsquo; of families in their adopted country, by limiting the size of their families.</p>
<p>But she took aim at the Pakistani community, saying uneducated immigrants are still following the traditions of their homeland by having more children because they end up getting a &#8216;bigger house&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She told peers: &#8216;The minority communities in this country, particularly the Pakistanis and the Bangladeshis, have a very large number of children and the attraction is the large number of benefits that follow the child.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nobody likes to accept that, nobody likes to talk about it because it is supposed to be very politically incorrect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Flather said parents of all backgrounds who have extra children should have no right to a larger council house. She added: &#8216;It is about time we stopped using children as a means of improving the amount of money they receive or getting a bigger house.</p>
<p>&#8216;I really feel that for the first two children there should be a full raft of benefits, for the third child three quarters and for the fourth child a half.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Welfare Reform Bill aims to cap the amount of benefits one family can received at around Â£26,000, to ensure claimants do not get paid more than the average income for working families.</p>
<p>In a speech likely to spark a fierce debate, Lady Flather said: &#8216;In the countries of origin, of course, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis and even Indians have large families because there is no safety net.</p>
<p>&#8216;When you get old it is only your children who are going to look after you. This doesn&rsquo;t apply here  &mdash;  every old person does have their pension and they will be looked after.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said that in education tables, while Indian children came at the top, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis came near the bottom, which she blamed on their families.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;Especially after  the recent riots, I think we need to give back the responsibility  for bringing up children to the parents. I hear parents say, &#8220;But the school should teach them that&#8221; and, &#8220;But the school should do that&#8221;. The school has so much less time with the child than the parents do.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>&#8220;(they) have large families because there is no safety net&#8221;</p>
<p>A complete lie.  They have large families, mostly males if possible, because they want to amass power, prestige and wealth.</p>
<p>This is why even the most educated Indians who come to the West contnue to have larger families than the host population.  It is the primal, agressive instinct to genetically dominate the ground.  </p>

		<p>do the math.  a white woman in a large city averages 1 child.  Minority women on welfare average 8-10 with some up to 24  In a few generations the minority welfare folk have taken over the city and the whites are a small minority.  In a few generations the minorities have increased 10,000 times their numbers.  Wake up fools</p>

		<p>I have generally believed that if a woman &#8220;accidentally&#8221; has a child she can not afford, that society should give her a helping hand; but if she returns that favor by repeating her foolishness, the assistance she receives should remain the same or be lowered by some amount. There is simply no reason to reward anyone for poor behavior. </p>

		<p>Why is it that whenever you read about the Indian community in Britain, you read about how they are more law abiding and better educated than white Britons? And whenever you read about Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, it&rsquo;s all cousin-marriage, welfare fraud, youth gangs, and militant Islam? I&rsquo;m sure Indian immigrants experienced just as much discrimination as other South Asians. </p>

		<p>Here in Baltimore you NEVER see a latino female who is walking alone; they always are carrying one child while pushing the one in the stroller and many times they are pregnant too. I will tell you the left is destroying our military men; they brainwash them to get on psych drugs tell them to cry and express their feelings   &mdash;   it is so sick. I get furious now they are committing suicide in droves. Patton would say life is hard and be strong.</p>

		<p>Saw a news clip on TV news a few days ago, an Australian entrepreneur had just opened a major shopping complex in a depressed part of London. I noticed that most of the (big) crowd seemed to be mainly Pakistani etc. (Complete with full Muslim attire)</p>
<p>Has anyone ever considered the implications of all of this uncontrolled exponential population growth? Six kids per very short generational span plus ongoing imports for arranged marriages. Where will they all fit in South East England, how long can the mainly white British taxpayers support all of this? All this should also be looked at in the big picture context of an already overpopulated planet. The UK government simply should not be paying benefits to encourage large 3rd world families.</p>
