			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>USA Today, September 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than a half-century after federal troops escorted nine black students into an all-white school, efforts to desegregate Little Rock&rsquo;s classrooms are at another turning point.</p>
<p>The state wants to end its long-running payments for desegregation programs, but three school districts that receive the money say they need it to continue key programs. And a federal judge has accused the schools of delaying desegregation so they can keep receiving an annual infusion of $70 million.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court will hear arguments Monday from both sides. The judges are expected to decide eventually whether Arkansas still has to make the payments and whether two of the districts should remain under court supervision.</p>
<p>The schools, which serve about 50,000 students, have come a long way since 1957, when the governor and hundreds of protesters famously tried to stop the Little Rock Nine from entering Central High School. But thousands of white and black children still have to be bused to different neighborhoods every day under one of the nation&rsquo;s largest remaining court-ordered desegregation systems.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some Little Rock schools remain as segregated as the neighborhoods around them. And achieving racial balance is becoming more difficult as families leave the suburbs that supply white students to schools in majority-black city neighborhoods. Despite years of efforts, black students still score much lower on tests than white students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Brian Miller pointed to problems with student achievement and discipline, particularly in Pulaski County, a suburban district that takes in black students from Little Rock and North Little Rock and sends white children to both.</p>
<p>After weeks of testimony, Miller concluded that &#8220;few, if any, of the participants in this case have any clue how to effectively educate underprivileged black children.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After decades of issuing court orders, judges across the country have shown in recent years that they want to get out of school desegregation, said Wendy Parker, a professor at Wake Forest University.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think courts have gotten exhausted with it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re stopping because they&rsquo;ve been successful. I think they&rsquo;re stopping because they feel it&rsquo;s time to move onto other issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other cities with schools that were desegregated by court order, such as Kansas City, Mo., and Charlotte, N.C., the classrooms eventually went back to reflecting the segregated neighborhoods around them, Parker said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody loves choice today,&#8221; Parker said. &#8220;But choice by definition allows people to self-segregate.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Since that law to promote integration turned out so well.</p>
<p>You can actually put a disastrous timeline beginning in 1954 with Brown vs Board of education.  going through the 60&rsquo;s and on   &mdash;  -<br>
It has been an utter disaster for white families.  <br>
Some of us survive, but the cost will catch up with all of us.  <br>
And it isn&rsquo;t pretty.  See maxine waters, farrankhan, rev.s jackson and wright, plus many other selfordained black racists&hellip;&hellip;.  <br>

		<p>Sounds like the judges are hearing that whisper in their ear that says &#8220;blacks only want to be educated up to a point, and no further- stop hurting Whites children who can do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or as William Gayley Simpson said, &#8220;Education should only be given to those who respond to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imagine how less high your property taxes would be if your city were run by those who don&rsquo;t believe there is an achievement gap.</p>
<p>There is a capacity and inclination gap, not achievement gap.  Achievement is just a measure of the C&I.;  You can&rsquo;t educate to close a chasm carved by nature to separate White Humanity from black diversity.</p>

<p>Why whatever else could possibly explain this?  It must be the teachers!</p>
<p>Of course, says the excuse mill of lame-o libtard broken ideology.  NEVER whip out ol&rsquo; Occam&rsquo;s razor and recognize the brutally painful, increasingly scientifically validated obvious&hellip; </p>
<p>Must be them evil, stupid ol&rsquo; white teachers.  They gotta figger out how to make all learning fun and easy and afrocentric&hellip;gotta learn how to rap out their lessons and appreciate the distinct verbal genius and areas of multiple intelligence in which the subsaharan african student excels and teach to the student&hellip;</p>
<p>Because any observed outcome which does not mesh with libtard canon&hellip;</p>
<p>MUST BE BECAUSE OF EVIL WHITE PEOPLE!!!! </p>
<p>Yet with all these wonderful, magical, do-gooder, fancy &#8220;scientific&#8221; modern ejucayshunul techniques our country&rsquo;s best and brightest Eed.&rsquo;s have cooked up these last 4-5 decades to get those little black kids to (PLEASE!  PLEASE LITTLE BLACK KIDS, give us white libtards SOMETHING - do at least a LITTLE better - at least don&rsquo;t do WORSE) perform according to ideologically predicted certitude&hellip;</p>
<p>Nothing seems to work&hellip;</p>
<p>So, must be evil ol&rsquo; whitey again.  What?  Were we just born with the evil gene?</p>
<p>Seems that&rsquo;s a lot more palatable to the libtard mind than EVER remotely considering the possibility that genetics might play a role in black&rsquo;s failure to achieve to white standards&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh Occam!  Such a racist!</p>

		<p>People are happier when they self-segregate into communities of their own choice. This does not matter to Wendy Parker, who is just here to help. You have to wonder what is wrong with these people. Maybe they are just in it for the paycheck. Maybe they need to take a tour of Detroit. Beats me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody loves choice today. But choice by definition allows people to self-segregate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
Well then, we&rsquo;ll just have to ELIMINATE the choice to self-segregate, won&rsquo;t we? Make togetherness mandatory. </p>
<p>Love, too. Love should also be mandatory. The government should get working on a Love Act bill right away. Because Love, like Freedom of Association, is far too important to be left to the private sector. </p>

<i>whether two of the districts should remain under court supervision.</i></p>
<p>More than five decades and the desegregation program still needs court supervision.</p>
<p>This should tell you that the original proposition for desegregation was faulty from the beginning.</p>
<p>If this hasn&rsquo;t taken root and become organically self-sustaining after half a century, it&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>
<p>These people will never admit they were wrong and children of both races will continue to suffer.   <br>

		<p> Black students still score much lower than White students on tests, not because they&rsquo;re &#8220;under-privileged,&#8221; but because they&rsquo;re &#8220;under-IQ&rsquo;ed.&#8221; When are we going to stop playing games with this embarrassing (for the liberals) fact, just admit it, and stop wasting huge amounts of money and time for these busing-for-school-integration schemes?</p>
<p> The courts are right to feel it&rsquo;s time to move on. It&rsquo;s time to say, &#8220;Hey, black kids, you&rsquo;re great at basketball, but when it comes to brains, well, sorry about your luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the achievement gap shows up whether the schools are public, private, charter, segregated, desegregated, etc. </p>

		<p>Just let people do what they like. Whites go to white schools, blacks go to black schools, and those who want to mix go to mixed schools.</p>
<p>And then we can try the same idea with self segregated towns, cities, states and nations. Easy stuff. Everybody&rsquo;s happy. We save countless millions in failed forced intregration programs, and basic freedom of association is preserved.</p>

		<p>Back in&rsquo;57, Gov. Orval Faubus  &mdash;  at the behest of the majority  &mdash;  used the National Guard to halt forced integration. Then Prez Eisenhower  federalized the troops ensuring the safe passage of 9 black students at Central High School. And the rest in history. BTW, statues of &#8220;The Little Rock 9&#8221; have been erected on the capitol grounds. </p>

		<p>I recently talked to an Indian family who lives in a small town in the deep South where segregated schools still exist (informally). They actually got &#8216;honorary white cards&rsquo; for their dark skinned kids so they could attend the safe white schools. The kids carry their cards in their pockets and tell other students that even though their skin is dark, they are &#8216;white inside&rsquo;- they are well behaved honor students who consistently score above the 95th percentile on standardized tests. Whenever someone calls them &#8216;Black,&rsquo; they pull out the copies of their test scores and their report cards, and they are instantly accepted as honorary whites.</p>

		<p>The original purpose of school desegregation was to enable children to attend public schools near their homes. That purpose is violated almost by definition by forced school busing. </p>

		<p>How much money has been robbed from race economy of White Humanity in the form of property taxes for black integration, income taxes for black equality, lost time and wages from White Flight to get away from the hostile and dangerously anti white blacks, and all the other erosions of our God intended White Freedoms for the sake of the blacks?</p>

<p>We weren&rsquo;t allowed, because those unmentionables who hate Gentiles knew our potential for the Great White Destiny, and they used the blacks to arrest our progress and push us downward toward equality of condition with the worst of the humanoid species.</p>
<p>This was done TO us, not BY us.  We must ever seek ways of justice and revenge.</p>
<p>Sam Dickson is a good analyst of the vast costs of integration. White Flight came at a huge price- lost time at work and with families.  All that driving time should have been invested in building, instead of avoiding.  Even that which was built, in spite of the extra added costs of White Flight will be taken over and destroyed by Diversity.</p>
<p>Give nothing to anything or anybody. Invest ONLY in your immediate White Family and Whites Only causes.  We simply cannot afford to continue supplying our enemies with our hard won treasure.   <br>

<p>Very good comment and so true.</p>
<p> We need to spend our resources ONLY on White causes. I used to donate to the Salvation Army but they have become so diversity driven that I stopped a few years back. Same with the Red Cross. Forget Africa and Haiti. I never donated a dime to their cause from the beginning. Call it intuition or racial INSTINCT (God given). Thank you, God.</p>
<p> Even most churches are diversity driven and donate to nonwhites worldwide. So forget them also. White altruism is the bane of White survival BECAUSE it is used AGAINST our own people. It was only meant for Whites helping Whites, but try to tell that to the &#8220;do-gooder&#8221;  Whites and they will look at you in aghast horror. </p>

To 20-</p>
<p>Churches are unsafe for White Humanity these days.  Why would a Whitey want to attend church and be told that only through integration with diversity will God allow peace and happiness? </p>
<p> Is that a God we would worship?  He fled those voodoo temples long ago&hellip; we should follow Him!</p>
<p>We must stop giving money to anybody or anything that helps blacks advance past their natural Africansims.  Every one step up the ladder for them, we are pushed down ten steps.  Our money and time and talent must be diverted away from all causes that promote the welfare of blacks and foster diversity.  </p>
<p>WE MUST BECOME HUMANITY&rsquo;S ORDAINED ISOLATIONISTS:  transcend diversity, embrace Whiteness, beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip; you see it in your worst nightmares&hellip; and you are extremely right!</p>
<p>When we invest, we must invest only in the preservation and success of our White Privilege.  When you seize an opportunity, seize it for the preservation and success of your White Privilege, not for adding fuel to the hostile and dangerously anti-white juggernaut of Black Privilege (Diversity and Inclusion).</p>
<p>All money transactions should be grafted or preceded with this question: &#8220;Will this purchase or donation help or hurt my White Privilege?&#8221; </p>
<p> We should ask that same question before any interaction of any kind. I curtail any contact with blacks as soon as possible, because I know that the longer I am object of their attention, the more endangered is my White Privilege.  </p>
<p>Whenever blacks are around, make yourself as invisible as possible, and never look them in the eye.  They interpret direct eye contact as a threat, and given that they all believe that social, remedial, restorative, and redemptive justice demands that they rob, rape, or murder some of your unearned White Privilege out of you, there is no reason to invite the attack with looking at them.  All blacks are a threat. You must avoid them as you would a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>Kant had his categorical imperative that was supposed to force us to query Enlightened Reason so as to emancipate ourselves from prejudicial tradition and custom.  We refuse. Our categorical imperative will be the imperative of our category of White Privilege.</p>
<p>Will this help or hurt my White Privilege?  That&rsquo;s the only question that matters after Brown vs. Board. </p>
<p>Our Imperative of White Privilege: &#8220;Prejudice renders a man&rsquo;s virtue his habit; and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.&#8221; Edmund Burke </p>
<p>Prejudice in our own favor renders our White virtue into our White habit of White Privilege.  Through justified prejudice, our White duty of White Privilege becomes a part of our White nature. When we give, we give only what strengthens our White Privilege.  When we take, we take only what  weakens the privileges of our enemies.</p>

 &#8220;It seems rather clear that white churches will stay white and black churches will stay black until there is a recommitment to the task of adhering to God&rsquo;s will for reconciliation. It will call for some sacrifices and they generally need to be made by whites who benefit the most from the privilege of the system and who need to express their willingness to take the first steps to show that they understand the new agreement and its call to reconciliation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I live in a small town in the west and there are very few blacks but a lot of poor whites and thier kids.  My impression is that no one was ever going to have any interest in those kids and all the government programs etc. to improve educational outcome would be underresourced because they are white. But thier world is the outcome of a lot of liberal policies and ideas as well; high divorce rates, exposure to immoral and violent media, drugs and even here - &#8216;gangsta culture&rsquo; which is somewhat related to the frightening increase in relocated Hispanics as well as the garbage that passess for popular culture.  Even if Blacks are not, as a group, possessed of higher IQs, exposure to the kind of thing that I have seen here certainly won&rsquo;t help them just as it hasn&rsquo;t helped the &#8216;thick as a brick&rsquo; white kids in the Rockies.</p>

		<p>Precepts of White Privilege</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who Ms. Meeks is, but she obtained her &#8216;Piled High and Deep&rsquo; (PhD) by toting the Marxist party line. What she is &#8216;preaching&rsquo; is not Christianity, as European Christendom knew it, but Maxist rhetoric. Pure and simple.</p>
<p>Christians are waking up to the lies of &#8216;perversi- i mean, Diversity&rsquo; more and more. Obama has done more to ideologically absolve Whites of the phoney &#8216;sin&rsquo; of [sic] &#8216;racism&rsquo; than any White Pastor could EVER have done.</p>
<p>Some sites you might all want to consider as &#8216;re-learning&rsquo; material for the restoration of White Christian views of the Faith of Europe:</p>

<p>You are right. I totally agree with you.</p>
<p>The links you listed very few White Christians (delusional as most are) of today with their heads full of mush, would even consider the truths, much less the links.  </p>
<p>Christians of today love the lies as was told in the Bible. Whatever tickles their ears. They love feeling all mushy and that God is for the &#8220;whole world&#8221; jibberish, that is taught from the pulpits of today&rsquo;s church. They are totally lost and like it that way. </p>

		<p>For the sake of the self esteem of black people, let them have their own schools. How would you like it it if you and your people were always the stupidest people in class? Let&rsquo;s give them a break. Segregate now, at least in schools.<br>

<p>You cannot give ANYONE self-esteem! They have to EARN it all on their own. As for segregation in the schools, we need TOTAL segregation in all areas of life. Better yet, we should DEMAND our OWN nation states! I do not ever want to pay taxes again for any black, mexican, asian or any other nonwhite, period. If they are allowed to remain in our States or country under one government we will still have to pay through the nose, even if segregated.</p>
