<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five Republican U.S Senate candidates and a fill-in for Pete Hoekstra vied for the affections of the &#8220;Ford Women&#8221; of Kent County Tuesday.</p>
<p>The hour-long forum at the Blythefield Country Club gave the candidates a chance to try out the lines they will be repeating for the next 10 1/2 months as they hope to knock off front-runner Hoekstra for a run at U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a two-term Democrat.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Roscommon businessman Peter Konetchy, a Christian Scientist, said he supports limits on the number of Muslims who should be allowed to immigrate into the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Muslims are setting up their own little groups that don&rsquo;t want to assimilate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Right now, we&rsquo;re at war with Islam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brighton businessman Chuck Marino also participated, saying he supported a reduced tax burden for businesses and individuals. &#8220;My approach to Washington will be from a strictly business perspective,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>Just look to Europe to see the disaster we&rsquo;ll have if Muslims continue to immigrate to this country. If they truly believe the Quaran, they are dedicated to getting rid of &#8220;infidels.&#8221; That&rsquo;s us, folks! London has areas that are forbidden to non-Muslims. These people mean to take over wherever they land. Wonder between the M&M;, who&rsquo;ll get us first?</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Mike Cox is not one of these five;  He is endorsing Hoekstra.  My interest in Cox is that he was the only real Republican (much less Democrat) politician of consequence in Michigan to openly endorse MCRI in 2006.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not at war with Islam. I am at war with those who force non-whites into White countires, whatever their peculiarities, religions, or what have you. We need to focus on the real issues here - dealing with Islamism is simply a sympton of a far greater and more insidious problem.        </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s good to hear pols speaking words that the liberals consider verboten.  Whether conservative office-seekers mean them or not, it shows their belief that many people likely agree with what is said and that such views can be publicly aired.</p>

		<p>File this one under the label of &#8220;things yet to be&#8221;. Our immigration system has long been based on the idea of national origin. The immigration reform of the 1960s did not change that, but rather allowed the reassignment of unused national quotas. As the Muslim population of Europe increases, European Muslims could be sent to the United States in large numbers under the national quotas of European countries.</p>
<p>The idea of religious restrictions of immigration seems strange to us. But it is useful to remember that Islam is both a religion and a world-wide geopolitical movement. Islam seeks the expansion of Middle Eastern tribal and ethnic culture. This impetus can barely be separated from the religion itself. If at all. </p>

		<p>The Bush tax cuts are still in effect. Much of Obama&rsquo;s stimulus package consisted of additional tax cuts. Where are the jobs? </p>

<p>Bingo, you hit the nail on the head.  This is not an ordinary &#8220;recession&#8221; we&rsquo;re in, we&rsquo;re in a near depression brought on in the short term by bankster treachery and over the long term by the slow drip drip one degree at a time boiling frog of deindustrialization.  Neither tax rate reductions nor stimulus will really do any good if said stimuli is only going to be wasted on China made junk at Wal*Martinez.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with most Republicans.  Sure business is important, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing.  That&rsquo;s why Republicans are so useless on the things that matter, like immigration and affirmative action.</p>
<p>As for jobs, the Republicans were just as eager to export all our manufacturing to China as the Democrats were.  </p>
