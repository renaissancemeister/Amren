<h1>Whites-Only Meetup.com Group Is Canceled</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erin Sherbert, SF Weekly, September 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a world where things aren&rsquo;t so black and white, any group formed exclusively for white people will almost certainly not last. </p>
<p>Which is why we weren&rsquo;t too surprised when we woke up this morning to find that the controversial Anglo Saxon-only Meetup.com group had disappeared overnight.  </p>
<p>On Sept. 3, a Meetup.com user that only goes by &#8220;k.&#8221; formed a new group for Bay Area professionals over the age of 40. The group&rsquo;s description read normally enough, inviting professionals who like food and fun  &mdash;  except the part where it called for only white people who like food and fun, which didn&rsquo;t seem so inviting after all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the group description said before it was taken down this morning: </p>
<blockquote>This group was created for Bay Area Professionals of Non-Color to network, unwind, and have a great time. This organized group is to help people come together to meet new friends, unite with old friends or even spark up a new relationship and in some cases all of the above.</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Joel Goldfoot, a San Francisco professional, was one &#8220;highly offended&#8221; user who immediately jumped on the group&rsquo;s purpose  &mdash;  and he wasn&rsquo;t the only one. Shortly after the group&rsquo;s creation, site users fired off comments, calling this all-white meetup inflammatory and, well, racist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Presuming there is a cultural difference between you and me because of skin color doesn&rsquo;t fly,&#8221; Goldfoot told SF Weekly yesterday evening.  &#8220;It&rsquo;s pretty offensive and pretty shortsighted, and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s the way the world works in San Francisco.&#8221;</p>
<p>But then another user, who goes by the name of Caroline, defended the group. &#8220;This group is no more racist/discriminatory than the groups who include only biracial couples, Latina/Latinos, East Indians, LGBTs, and so on,&#8221; she wrote on the group&rsquo;s thread before it was removed. </p>
<p>The exclusiveness of this particular group was drawing too much negative attention, and at some point on Wednesday, the group changed its descriptor from &#8220;non-color&#8221; to &#8220;Anglo Saxon.&#8221; The founder of the group then posted the following message, presumably to ease tensions:</p>
<blockquote>Thank you all for your comments. If find the terminology of &#8220;Non-Color&#8221; offensive, feel free to exchange the term with Anglo Saxon. (&#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; is used to refer to peoples descended or associated in some way with the English ethnic group). This site was copied word for word from an &#8220;Asian Professional&#8221; meetup group. The only difference is the word &#8220;Asian&#8221; was removed. It is meant for like minded people from similar backgrounds, upbringing, cultural and life experience, social morals and orientation, etc..to come together and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. This group is NOT racist or for racists, all non-racist people are welcome.</blockquote>
<p>Goldfoot says the change in terminology didn&rsquo;t make the group itself any less offensive, and he&rsquo;s pretty certain that this violates Meetup.com hate speech policy. &#8220;I&rsquo;m no attorney, but when I read their terms of hate speech section, it seems like it could be a violation,&#8221; he told us. </p>
<p>{snip} It is not yet clear whether the group voluntarily disbanded or whether Meetup.com removed it.  </p>

		<p>Most of our activists are idiots.  John Wilkes Booth, James Earl Ray, Byron de la Beckwith, Thomas Coleman, etc.  Our militants do nothing but make martyrs out of our enemies.</p>
<p>The Angl-Saxon Meet Up group should have stated its goal at &#8220;meeting with just ourselves to discuss the courageous and heroic victories of African Americans in their struggle to come together in unity of fight against injustice and inequality.  We will study there race consciousness and discuss how we can contribute to the continuum.&#8221;<br>

		<p>The hypocrisy of this is so obvious.  If this can&rsquo;t be pointed out as a double standard and a violation of the Right to Assembly, Free Speech, and even Free Movement and affiliation, I would have to conclude that this nation is finished as far as a &#8220;free country&#8221; description is concerned, or even &#8220;same country.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I love how all the offended parties seem so clueless about the hypocrisy of the other &#8220;of color&#8221; sites.  Replacing the word &#8220;Asian&#8221; with &#8220;Anglo-Saxon&#8221; drives them to sputtering shouts about &#8220;hate&#8221;, whereas they nod approvingly at the Asian and other groups.  They just seem stupid, if they can&rsquo;t get the point.</p>

		<p>True that there are many, Indian meetups, Chinese meetups, Punjabi meetups, Latino meetups, but a white meetup is a no-no.</p>
<p>of course, I would sign up for the &#8216;white meetup&rsquo; asking them if I could become an &#8216;honorary white&rsquo; because of my beliefs. I bet they would let me join too.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m far less concerned with whether something is offensive than I am with its legality. Crucifixes might be offensive to Satanists. Should we start banning churches? I find crude blaring rap music to be offensive, yet I&rsquo;m assaulted with it on a daily basis at stoplights, or when the custom ringtone blares on someone&rsquo;s phone. I would prefer not to see a group of overweight bicyclists wearing spandex, but I don&rsquo;t have the right to forbid them from assembling.</p>

		<p>This has to become the first pro-white issue on the agenda; Recovering the right of whites to gather up as whites, just as any other group.  If we can be stopped from doing that, then no conference place will be found for Amren or any other typed white advocacy conference, or meeting, or church, or ANYTHING.  The denial of this right is the denial to even exist.</p>

		<p>Well here is another smoking gun showing that whites are being discriminated against. If they used the exact same language as the Asian group, then there shouldnt be a problem. Unless Meetup wants to stop all groups that are exclusive. The fact is most groups on Meetup discriminate, that is the whole purpose (or process) of finding people similiar to yourself. </p>

		<p>Of course it is racist for Anglo Saxons to have the same opportunities to meet and share their culture as Asians, Blacks, Latinos, etc.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that whites are not allowed to have pride, culture or social mores.  That is racist.  And of course they can&rsquo;t have a meetup without people of color, they are obviously too stupid to pull off such an event without wise coloreds showing them the way.</p>
<p>And the thing would be a bore anyway without the diverse one&rsquo;s bad manners and rudeness to liven up the event and show whitey how to have a good time.  Whiteys are boring, don&rsquo;t you know.`</p>

<p><br>
The same terminology was used as a group for Asians and yet Mr Goldfoot apparently isn&rsquo;t offended that Asians want to associate with other Asians. This man, and others, are proof that many Americans have been conditioned and brainwashed to see racism in the action of Whites and not to see racism in the same exact actions by other races. </p>
<p>I have had the same &#8220;discussion&#8221; countless times on various websites. It has been my experience that the majority of Whites do indeed see racism in situations like the above story. And no amount of logic or reasoning can change their position. That is why I have given up trying. They see nothing wrong with an all black &#8220;family reunion, black congressional congress, miss black america&#8221;, la raza, or any other racially exclusive organization or group. And yet they will jump up and down and scream racism if you say that Whites should be afforded the same rights. How can otherwise rational people take this position?? How do they not see the racist double standards applied to White people?? </p>
<p>**{snip} It is not yet clear whether the group voluntarily disbanded or whether Meetup.com removed it.**</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no attorney either, but I would think the White group would have grounds for a lawsuit. &#8220;IF&#8221; this group was removed by the website and they didnt voluntarily leave the site. We are going to have to start using every legal means at our disposal to combat this anti White insanity. And I do believe hitting them hard in the wallet is the best weapon that we have. CURRENTLY!!</p>

		<p>Just being White is not interesting enough for me. There is no telling what kind of mix I would be thrown into, and I, being White, am more discriminating than that. </p>
<p>Europa is spiritual  &mdash;  it is excellence in art, science, philosophy, and the industrial crafts. </p>
<p>Just form a group for excellence in art, culture, literature, technology, etc. Most members will be White. Yes, there will be some Asians and a few blacks, but they will be European in spirit.</p>
<p>But, that aside, Why would Goldfoot condemn a meeting of people based on skin color? Because he is afraid of the power and identity that Whites might find.</p>

<p>- Mr. Goldfoot does not understand me, at all.  I am well aware that there are many people, even within my own race, that do not share my culture, and as well there are those who are non-White who may be culturally similar to me.  That&rsquo;s not the point: I wish to meet and relate to those who are like me -both- in terms of race and background (similar culture).  I do not mix, other than superficially, with those of another culture, and I do not care to mix, more than superficially, with those of a different race.  The world at large can deny me the right of association, but the end result is always conflict and destruction; we have never, and will never, create the utopia the Left seems determined to force upon us.</p>

		<p>What is the racial/ethnic background of Joel Goldfoot, the man who can&rsquo;t stop ranting and raving about this &#8220;offensive&#8221; new club? He&rsquo;s probably not a person of color but I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he is ethnically Jewish (given the Gold in his name). Not trying to &#8220;Jew-bait&#8221; but It&rsquo;s obvious he hates the people who created this country, the Anglo-Saxons. Because he wouldn&rsquo;t be enraged and foaming at the mouth if this involved any other race or ethnicity. In fact, I think he would be delighted. </p>

		<p>I think it&rsquo;s a positive sign that some white people are willing to start groups like these.  They are beginning to express themselves a little. If they would only stand firm on what they want to do; don&rsquo;t back down even by changing the terminology. They should start their own website.</p>

<p>Well.  He&rsquo;s offended.  That&rsquo;s enough reason to shut it down.  We can&rsquo;t have people being offended at anything &#8220;in the year 2011.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s like the entire cold war was a fraud, because the same people who used to say stuff like, &#8220;I&rsquo;m so glad I have freedom&#8221; are the same one&rsquo;s that break into a cold sweat and start screaming for censorship if they see something they don&rsquo;t like.

		<p>They should have used the term European/European-American which would be more akin to termsn like Latino/Latina, Asian, Jewish, etc..  It would still be called rascist but &#8220;people of non-color&#8221; comes across as snotty or stupid.</p>

<p>What is the racial/ethnic background of Joel Goldfoot, the man who can&rsquo;t stop ranting and raving about this &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; new club?

Not trying to &ldquo;Jew-bait&rdquo; but It&rsquo;s obvious he hates the people who created this country, the Anglo-Saxons.

<p>Tell it like it is. You are exactly right. Oh, but we are not allowed to &#8220;offend&#8221; anyone that is NOT White, are we? Never a two way street for us. One way only.</p>
<p>We have to change that and quit worrying about being offensive or racist as it hasn&rsquo;t done us one bit of good to do otherwise.</p>

		<p>Why is it that the first second somebody complains about a positive white group or statement, the white person feels the need to say that they are not racist, never intended to be racist, and  do not hang out with racists?  </p>
<p>If you are going to go down, then go down fighting. Make a statement like, &#8220;I do not care who this  group offends. I shall make no apologies for being pro white or wishing to hang out with other white people. If this group offends you then you are most likely anti-white or a self loathing, liberal white. If you do not like it, then that is an issue you should deal with amongst yourself. Stop attacking me and my group with racist, anti white rhetoric.&#8221;</p>
<p>You may not win. But atleast you stood your ground, did not apologize, and went down fighting. Instead of begging and whining about not being racist. Ofcourse you are racist, you are white, and whites are ALWAYS racist. </p>

		<p>&#8220;We should never ever describe ourselves as non-color even in jest&#8221;</p>
<p>non-white is a term that&rsquo;s used sometimes as in the term people of color. i think resistingdefamation.org claims one of these terms is offensive to whites. .

<p>I Googled Herr Goldfoot (dreadful name-no doubt the concoction of &#8220;Mittle&#8221; European non-english speaking immigrants). </p>
<p>  The jerk would seem to be your typical expensive do-nothing with a lot of wispy, completely unessential &#8220;credentials&#8221;..i.e, your typical self-absorbed, urban, &#8220;educated&#8221; white-collar parasite. What a complete jerk! Perfect for the &#8220;new&#8221; San Francisco. That town and it&rsquo;s mad inhabitants should drop into the Pacific. The trecherous currents of the Bay would sweep them all to oblivion.</p>
<p> Anyway, is there anything more offensive than hearing some tw*t declare how offended he, or she, or it is? It&rsquo;s become the new conversation stopper, like &#8220;racist&#8221; has been for years. Guaranteed to stop all discourse while the bewildered recipient puzzles over what exactly it was they said to bring the exalted, protected party to a such a state of high dudgeon. I too believe that the posting of that group was a prank. The professional class of whites in major urban areas are too cosmopolitan to see any need for white solidarity. Little wonder, since they&rsquo;re usually in the elite. The few of them with any racial conciousness would also be discouraged from forming public groups of that sort anyway. Who wants to fend off the cloning hordes of pod people? How booorriinng!</p>
<p>  Frankly, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the offensively-named Goldfoot wasn&rsquo;t behind this. It isn&rsquo;t unheard of for members of protected groups to conjure up hate incidents, now is it?</p>
<p>  For your amusement, I&rsquo;m linking to Jim Goad&rsquo;s highly-offensive skewering of the inhabitants of Booby-Hatch-by-the-Bay. https://goo.gl/9tjhB</p>

Call it The Potato Salad Lovers&rsquo; Group or something (the Joel Goldfoot Fan Club?). Make it screamingly obvious that your target audience is White people. Get these idiot leftists spun up to 30,000 rpm and foaming at the mouth. After a few days, take the group down.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat. </p>
<p>And poster &#8220;Bobby&#8221; has a point. Whatever else you may think of them, good old Joel just isn&rsquo;t going to go down to the local Hell&rsquo;s Angels clubhouse and start screaming at them to start letting blacks join up. </p>

The founding fathers of the nation would have been found inexcusably offensive by those who have taken what the fathers fought for and put in writing as intended for their own posterity, because the very first citizenship law, the Naturalization Act of 1790, limited citizenship to &#8220;free white persons&#8221; of &#8220;good moral character&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to those who have taken control of the nation, not only is America no longer reserved for those meeting either of the two aforementioned characteristics, but those who do must be prevented from associating exclusively anywhere. </p>
<p>The reason for this is obvious: a revival of white European identity will lead to a revival of brave and bold action to secure the land, rights (life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness) and privileges for whites fortunate enough to be either born American or who naturalize, and the end of the destructive parasitism and theft of our inheritance and our children&rsquo;s future by invading hordes of hostile anti-whites.  </p>

		<p>You supposedly racial aware types should pay close attention to incidents like this.  There is a movement among whites to express our race as one race among many.  The attitude is that if we grovel enough, disempower ourselves enough, and most importantly, reject white supremacy enough&hellip;we will be accepted as a race among many races.  Even the separatists have this foolishness as a core belief.  The idea that we should simply be left alone in our own white nations while other races have their own countries.</p>
<p>These are nice fantasies but, unfortunately, the ONLY people who maintain them are whites.  Other races look upon us the way a barbarian marauder would.  They see our superiority.  They see the great wealth it has created for us.  Knowing full well they could never create such for themselves, they seek to take it from us and kill us.  The former out of greed, the latter out of shame.  We are a constant reminder to them that they are lesser and that their morality is evil.  They hope to erase that reminder.  They are only looking for a weakness.  Show them weakness and they will attack.  That is what is behind the &#8220;flashmob&#8221; phenomenon. We simply showed weakness by electing Obama&hellip;..and now they attack random whites.  They will continue to do it until we re-assert ourselves.</p>
<p>We have and have had a constant state of war between the white race and all other races.  Some are much more aggressive about it, then others.  Nevertheless, the situation exists.</p>
<p>And there is only one appropriate attitude with regard to war&hellip;.win.  Win at any cost.  Because losing means death.  And winning, in this case means white supremacy.  It means white domination of all other races.</p>
<p>When this guy formed his little group, he was seeking acceptance of white among other races.  When they rejected him, he groveled.  That is a mistake.  It would have been far preferable for him to aggressively maintain the superiority of whites and a distaste, even hatred of non-whites.  Even if he was run out of town, there are many places in this country where he would find MANY who feel the same way.  Several hundred or several thousand militant friends of this type would be far preferable to &#8220;acceptance&#8221; by the other races.  To their mind, &#8220;acceptance&#8221; means we&rsquo;ll kill you last, as long as you collaborate.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m no attorney either, but I would think the White group would have grounds for a lawsuit. &#8220;</p>
<p>Attorneys do not take lawsuits that they will not win.  If the White group came up with a $30,000 retainer, they might, just might find an attorney to take the case. Almost no pro White lawsuits are ever won.  Even with a huge retainer, an attorney might hesitate to take on a pro White lawsuit for fear of damage to his or her career.</p>
<p>Most attorneys were throughly indoctrinated with anti White propaganda from kindergarten through law school anyway.</p>
<p>There is one group, Pacific Legal Foundation that takes a few pro White cases.  Mostly though, it is very, very big and wealthy contractors who were turned down by goverment agencies in favor of affirmative action contractors.</p>
<p>Most of the current contractor cases PLF is doing involve White contractors who were discriminated against by California goverment agencies despite Prop 209.</p>
<p>Just one more example of how Prop 209 has never, ever been enforced.  It was never intended to be enforced in my opinion.</p>

		<p>Very disheartening! We Whites are heading cheerfully towards extinction. We traverse the globe to care for, feed, clothe and educate alien races. We talk of their nobility, their greatness, their accomplishments and their cultures with admiration and reverence. We turn a blind eye and wink as these alien groups conquer us silently, making off with our women  &mdash;  in essence, our future. We are the only group on the planet that has NO cohesion as a distinct group. We are the laughing stock of other groups who are raping and pillaging us. We are hated when we give promiscuously to these alien groups, all the while not comprehending WHY they hate us. We create greatness, and then we are brainwashed into believing that our greatness is responsible for all of the ills of this world. And we BELIEVE IT. And here in this article lies a classic example of how completely effective the psychological warfare has been waged. This poor dupe in the article cannot see the colossal hypocrisy right before his scale covered eyes. He rails against his people and would cheer for those who will one day spit in his face. God if we don&rsquo;t wake up&hellip;.</p>

<p>There is NO justification for this site to be down.  NONE.  </p>
<p>I am glad these things are being publicized (like the bake sale in Berkeley, which is receiving national attention), the more publicity the better to make whites more aware of our enemies&rsquo; tactics.  It&rsquo;s a start, if anything, and we must keep it going at all times, keep it out in the open, up for discussion.</p>
<p>As Saul Alinsky told his minions:  4. <b>Make the enemy live up to his own book of rules.</b></p>
<p>Ask WHY Whites are not allowed to gather as are all other groups.  Demand reasons when anyone claims it&rsquo;s racist if Whites wish to assemble peaceably as guaranteed by The Constitution.  Point out the hypocrisy to jerks like Goldfoot if you encounter it.  </p>
<p><i>We are going to have to start using every legal means at our disposal to combat this anti White insanity. And I do believe hitting them hard in the wallet is the best weapon that we have.</i></p>
<p>Mike:</p>
<p>The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees five rights, one of which is the Right to Assemble Peaceably.  THIS is the ground upon which we need to sue, that plus racial discrimination.</p>
<p> Hitting us in the wallet is one of the weapons our enemies uses against us, dragging us through court and then suing the H out of us.  We must make use of this tactic against them as well.  Our enemies play hardball, they are not nice, have no qualms about utterly destroying us and won&rsquo;t stop until we are gone.  It&rsquo;s time to fight fire with fire because that is the only thing that will work against these people who wish to eliminate us.</p>
<p>We must do this before it&rsquo;s too late, while we still have a First Amendment, which our enemies are busy trying to overturn.</p>
<p>From VDare.com</p>
<p><i>The UN committee monitoring the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination told the United States in 2001 to overturn the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because it was an obstacle to outlawing what the committee regarded as hate speech.</i></p>

		<p>You are right, the problem will not be solved by lawyers.<br>
 As a matter of fact faith in the legal system is a huge mistake to make for whites. <br>
   I know of an attorney who wouldnt continue to go after some illegal violent criminal hispanics because he wanted to stay on good terms with the local police. A white woman was dumped and left to her own devices ..<br>
 I know of another white woman in the same area, who was falsely arrested by the lies of two illegal mexicans, and her attorney - fresh out of law school, a public defender, was indoctrinated with so much liberal crap that she blew the case. Two mexicans who needed spanish interpreters managed to jail an American never before convicted of a crime. <br>
   So don&rsquo;t expect the police or the lawyers to save you. ps, I was innocent but even if I had a million dollars I wouldnt go back because I now know that the white old boys club has merged with the Illegal alien underground to form a really ugly new world order.</p>

If marxists and whining third worlders keep pushing to ostracize and shut down Anglos who merely want to get together to be happy, safe and carefree,  those idiots are going to get an explosive force of backlash, one day.</p>

Here&rsquo;s my 2 cents of historical input.  First, I want to field the idea that called whites &#8220;Anglos,&#8221; and &#8220;WASPS&#8221; has long become a pejorative, meant to connote a derogatory meaning.  Second, it is usually projected onto any white that looks Northern European.</p>
<p>Anglo Saxons invaded England, which was somewhat depopulated due to the Roman occupation, when many Celtic British were victims or genocidal campaigns.  The Romanized survivors resisted the Anglo-Saxons for a short while before making peace and integrating with them, while the fiercest removed themselves to Wales.  But Anglo-Saxons also remained in their traditional regions in German territory and of course there had always since been a Saxony there.  (I have a 19th century coin from German Saxony).  The Normans came later, but they were a combination of Viking settlers, Franks, and Gallo-Romans (Romanized Celts).  Vikings, (Danes and Norwegians) also settled in various spots in the British Isles.  So referring to white English as Anglo-Saxons isn&rsquo;t even that accurate.  Surnames do give some hints, and genealogy makes things clearer.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Attorneys do not take lawsuits that they will not win. If the White group came up with a $30,000 retainer, they might, just might find an attorney to take the case. Almost no pro White lawsuits are ever won. Even with a huge retainer, an attorney might hesitate to take on a pro White lawsuit for fear of damage to his or her career.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just ask Edgar J. Steele. As a first amendment rights lawyer for unpopular White Supremacist nut groups (Church of the Creator) he was reluctantly awoken to the brainwashing, and Christophobic and Caucophobic hatred the PTB have for we Whites of European, Christian descent.</p>
<p>He had a sham trial, and is now in jail, While his wife (whom, it was alleged, he was trying to kill) maintains his innocence, stays married to him, and is raising funds for his appeal.</p>
<p>As a lawyer, he knew he had to do things by the book, but what good did it do him? &#8216;By deceit, thou shalt wage war&rsquo; is a motto of only one group out there. I just wonder (as many others do) if they were not behind it all, in the first place.</p>

		<p>On Sept. 3, a Meetup.com user that only goes by &ldquo;k.&rdquo; formed a new group for Bay Area professionals over the age of 40. The group&rsquo;s description read normally enough, inviting professionals who like food and fun &mdash; except the part where it called for only white people who like food and fun, which didn&rsquo;t seem so inviting after all.</p>
<p>Joel Goldfoot, a San Francisco professional, was one &ldquo;highly offended&rdquo; user who immediately jumped on the group&rsquo;s purpose &mdash; and he wasn&rsquo;t the only one. Shortly after the group&rsquo;s creation, site users fired off comments, calling this all-white meetup inflammatory and, well, racist.</p>
<p><br>
The more I think about it, the more I beleive that Goldfoot created the organization, flamed it under numerous names, took it down and claimed credit so he could be interviewed on SF Weekly.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t live in San Francisco any more, but the entire episode fits common patterns of attention seeking people.  It probably has something to do with Joel getting some sort of journalism job.  Probably he wants to be an occasional paid by the piece contributor to Weirdos Weekly.<br>

The Romans left britain in roughly 410 A.D. The germanic tribes didn&rsquo;t get there until AFTER the romans left. And when they got there, they essentially wiped clean the native celtic population. Before the migration of the angles and saxons, England had a celtic population. You are wrong to assert that the Romans &#8220;enslaved&#8221; the ancestors of the modern anglo-saxon people. And if you want to go deeper, &#8220;Anglo saxon&#8221; is a sub-group of the Germanic racial group commonly found in england. </p>

<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end. WE are all of the White race. THAT is what is important. We need to all come together to fight off our common enemy. We, as WASPS, Anglo Saxons, a mixture of European nationalities, (which most of us are, my sister used to call us Heinz 57) need to defend each other and become a collective as a RACE. We are all one from many different nations (Caucasian tribes). That is what is meant by our motto. One out of many (nations). European nations that is. No other.</p>
