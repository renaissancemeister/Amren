	<p>Sept. 8, 2011</p>
<p>From Jim Dean: JimWDean@aol.com</p>
<p><br>
Dear Friends of Miss Elizabeth,<br>
 </p>
<p>As of this morning I am holding her remains under my name now at the Brooklyn medical examiners. No family had come forward and I wanted to put the brakes on the Potters Field option. Because she had lived in the Bronx there were two city groups to deal with. They confirmed her estate was zero or they would have used any funds to bury her already.</p>
<p>Plans now are to probably have her remains cremated (costs and logistics) and brought down to Atlanta where she had a wide following in Georgia among the Southern heritage folks. I owe her for 90% of everything I know about the civil rights movement trashing the Booker. T. movement and the disastrous consequences that it had.</p>
<p>We are in a good position logistically to have a memorable ceremony for her here, at a suitable time, and produce a video of the event to share online with all those who admired her courage and her work.</p>
<p>The Georgia Heritage Council (I am the new chairman &hellip; Jeff Davis is emeritus now after many years of service) has offered to accept and be accountable for donations. We will do this in two parts starting with the cremation and shipping to Atlanta. And then we will have some time to explore ceremony options, timing, and final decisions for disposition of her remains based on funding that is available.</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicion that some of her ashes might end up with Booker T. Washington.</p>
<p>Our whole focus is to not have this unique and rare lady&rsquo;s legacy go out with a fizzle, and that we can use her passing as a jump start to keep the legacy of her work ongoing. Maybe then the rest of us can be a bit more optimistic about the same happening to our work with our times come.</p>
<p>I will update you on specifics as they develop. I will continue looking for contacts to fill us on in on the missing pieces of her life, what kind of work she did, any clues as to her resistance in personally meeting her historical colleagues, etc.</p>
<p>We will also begin making sure that we have a safe copy of all of her archival Issues and Views work and begin planning a presentation of it on a new formatted &#8216;in memorium&rsquo; website for her.</p>
<p>I got an rough quote today on cremation and getting her ashes down here at roughly $1000.</p>
<p>Donations for this effort can be made out to:</p>
<p>Georgia Heritage Council, Inc.  (please note that it is for Elizabeth Wright)<br>
c/o Jim W. Dean<br>
2121 Hollywood Road<br>
Atlanta, Georgia, 30318</p>
<p><br>
We have avoided a double tragedy here. I might have heard about this a month later after it was all over and she was in Potters Field. </p>

		<p>My Lord, it appears her own family abandoned her.  She was such a great lady but I guess blacks are too busy hating whitey to see that she was merely trying to turn the black race around.  She knew that they were headed to doom-dom on their present course and wanted them to rise above the hypocrisy, degradation and coddling that has ruined all hope of self-determination.</p>
<p>I am definitely sending a check out tomorrow!</p>

		<p>The majority of blacks who know anything about her most likely hate her more than the K.  To them, she is an Uncle Thomasina.  Their real hero is Louis Farrakhan.</p>

		<p>Peejay, you&rsquo;re right. That&rsquo;s all the more reason to send her off properly.</p>

		<p>There are indications  amidst the massive confusions<br>
about race in America that quite a few of the more socially-<br>
emotionally secure Blacks among the top 10% of the Black<br>
Bell Curve, do not on a private and personal basis have much<br>
doubt about &#8220;Jensenism&#8221;/ about a Black-White IQ gap that may be<br>
mainly of biological, not social, origin.  But, more significantly, they say almost nothing at large in the Black<br>
community, since massive rage and retaliation is visited upon<br>
them by most Blacks if their personal views are known.  It would seem that Elizabeth Wright&rsquo;s commemoration bears witness to this sad fact of contemporary life.  </p>

		<p>Re #5<br>
An issue in this might be what one ordinary Black charcterized<br>
for me as &#8220;not the size of the Black mind but the color of the White heart&#8221;.  The taboo most Blacks insist applying to &#8220;Jenenism&#8221; might be seen as the same stricture everyone would make as to crying out &#8220;Fire! Fire!&#8221; in a crowded theatre. ??<br>
If this be true, it might be easier to break the Great Taboo<br>
by involving some counterpoint about the color of  White hearts?</p>
