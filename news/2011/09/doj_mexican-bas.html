			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edwin Mora, CNS News, September 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mexican drug-trafficking organizations &#8220;control access to the U.S.-Mexico border&#8221; and the &#8220;smuggling routes across&#8221; it, &#8220;resulting in unprecedented levels of violence in Mexico&#8221; and allowing those drug trafficking organizations and their associates to &#8220;dominate the supply and wholesale distribution of most illicit drugs in the United States,&#8221; according to the Justice Department&rsquo;s newly published 2011 National Drug Threat Assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mexican-based trafficking organizations control access to the U.S.  &mdash;  Mexico border, the primary gateway for moving the bulk of illicit drugs into the United States,&#8221; says the assessment published by DOJ&rsquo;s National Drug Intelligence Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;The organizations control, simultaneously use, or are competing for control of various smuggling corridors that they use to regulate drug flow across the border,&#8221; says the assessment. &#8220;The value they attach to controlling border access is demonstrated by the ferocity with which several rival TCOs [transnational criminal organizations] fighting over control of key corridors, or &#8216;plazas.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>The assessment predicts that Mexican drug traffickers will maintain dominance of the U.S. illicit drug market for years to come in part because of their &#8220;control of the smuggling routes across&#8221; the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;Major Mexican based TCOs and their associates are solidifying their dominance of the U.S. wholesale drug trade and will maintain their reign for the foreseeable future,&#8221; say the assessment. &#8220;The Mexican-based organizations&rsquo; preeminence derives from a competitive advantage based on several factors, including access to and control of smuggling routes across the U.S. Southwest Border and the capacity to produce (or obtain), transport, and distribute nearly every major illicit drug of abuse in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;These advantages are unlikely to change significantly in the short term, ensuring the dominance of Mexican-based TCOs for at least the next several years,&#8221; says the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The assessment predicts that cooperation between Mexican drug cartels and U.S. street gangs in both smuggling and distributing drugs will increase in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Collaboration between U.S. gangs and Mexican-based TCOs will continue to increase, facilitating wholesale drug trafficking into and within the United States,&#8221; says the assessment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In April, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the U.S.-Mexico border is not &#8220;overrun or out of control&#8221;  &mdash;  adding that those who make such claims are just trying to score political points.</p>

		<p>Use predator drones to patrol the border and bring the troops home for real boots (and guns) on the ground.</p>
<p>Program the drone to know the border and when anything crosses the line, it can either lock on and follow, transmitting location to border patrol or the drone could just vaporize the smuggler from the air.  Troops could be housed at a series of bases along the border  &mdash;   good government contracting jobs for white americans who pass drug tests  &mdash;   so that they were never too far away from the trouble spots). We just built (and outfitted) a few hundred billion dollars worth of bases in Iraq and abandoned them to the Iraqi forces who immediately looted them. We could have kept all that money here in our own economy and had a secure border to show for it which would also reduce the unemployment problem further. </p>
<p>Then you legalize drugs, reducing the cartels&rsquo; profit margins to zero and making them unable to afford to operate. Their whole business model depends on astronomical proceeds from drugs which only exist because of the prohibition.</p>
<p>Of course it doesn&rsquo;t help either that DOJ is also in the control of a foreign-based organization&hellip; </p>

		<p>Well, good news. Napolitano will be the dog- catcher of Juarez after Obama gets his travel tickets in 2012. <br>
If the country lasts that long.<br>
Now is the time to push on the decrepit liberal establishment. In Academia, in the public schools, in government, in the workplace, it is floundering under the weight of it&rsquo;s incompotence, and the economic disaster. <br>
Whites have had enough, and are angry. Some true - believer Libtards are actually questioning their faith.<br>
Hand them their new ideology, now. <br>
Let&rsquo;s not be a few hundred closet crybabies. Millions are waiting for the next shoe to drop.<br>
That shoe is YOURS.</p>

		<p>It is obvious that the US has to find its back bone and close the border or we as a culture will cease to exist period.  over run with drugs and foreign peoples entering the country at will how can we claim to have control of our society in any real capacity?  My grandfather in the national guard patroled the Mexican border prior to WWI.  We need real troops on the ground and suspension of constitutional rights when it comes to the drug war.  No bleeding hearts or lawyers.  drug dealers have the right to a swift death period.  We must realize that war has been declared on us and wake up to reality</p>

		<p>The elitist globalist marxists and fascists are deliberately orchestrating these problems as well as profitting off of these activities themselves, directly and indirectly. The drug war itself is a deliberate orchestration monopolization of the drug trade. The dynamic is exactly the same as that of prohibition, which, as everyone knows increased the profits for smugglers and created a dangerous crime syndicate. The immigration quislings are deliberately attacking whites and the middle class because whites and the middle class are the only powerful supporters of liberty and American independence. The elitists are creating multiple problems that are a grave danger to us. However, do not make the mistake of following the fearful crowd that says &#8220;we all need to stick together, THEY are trying to get us to fight amongst ourselves, THEY just want an excuse to impose martial law [and we have no chance of resisting them, we are so helpless, they claim].&#8221; The lie that they and their cowering enablers among so-called promote is that we are helpless and that they can destroy us and all they need is an excuse. They call every person who calls for action a government provocateur who is trying to create an excuse for the all-powerful elitists, the all-powerful government to declare martial law and we are helpless to resist so do not call for actions, they strongly imply.  It reminds one of the hostages who always try to prevent the others from taking any action, the fearful watchdogs of their own people. They run websites that complain about elitist abuses but constantly say that we are helpless and shouldn&rsquo;t take effective action.  Well, if we are so weak and they are so powerful, why do they even need an excuse? </p>
<p>We white Americans do need to stick together but it is sheer folly to claim helplessness and acquiesce. Furthermore, our differences with blacks and Mexicans illegal aliens are irreconcilable. What is necessary and possible, though not easy, is to defeat both the elitists and the ethnic groups that have decided to be our MORTAL ENEMIES.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The US-Mexican border is not overrun or out of control.&#8221;</p>
<p>It should also be noted that this same Napolitano kook also told us that &#8220;Underpants Bomber&#8221; Umar Abdulmutallab&rsquo;s failure to bring down an airliner on Christmas day, 2009 was &#8220;proof that the system worked,&#8221; when in fact the system - and nearly 300 passengers and flight crew - simply got lucky with inept bomb construction.</p>
<p>Napolitano should be recognized as a pathological liar of Clintonesque proportions; it&rsquo;s easy tell when she&rsquo;s lying - her lips are moving.</p>
<p>As for the suggestion by Anonymous (2) that she would make a fine dog-catcher for Juarez, Mexico, I would reply that given the level of &#8220;honesty&#8221; she has displayed, she would be far better as that city&rsquo;s police chief; she fits Mexican law-enforcement&rsquo;s honesty standards to a T.</p>
