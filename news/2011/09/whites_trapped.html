			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Bheki Mbanjwa, Daily News, September 20, 2011 </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The rejection of demands for social justice such as the proposed &#8220;wealth tax&#8221; was proof that many white South Africans were in denial and trapped in pseudo innocence and a &#8220;new identity of victimhood&#8221;, theologian and antiapartheid activist Allan Boesak said.</p>
<p>He described the new identity of victimhood as a condition experienced from a loss of political power, guaranteed socio-economic advantage and privileged insulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seeks to close down the past without dealing with it or recognising its unfinished business. It acts as if the past has no bearing whatsoever on the present, and thus the continuing suffering of the real victims of the past&rsquo;s unfinished business is first blurred, then trivialised and then rendered invalid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boesak was speaking on Monday at the University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal in Durban where he delivered the Stev Biko memorial lecture.</p>
<p>It was this kind of pseudo innocence, he said, that was being used to avoid social justice measures like the wealth tax as proposed by Archbishop Emiritus Desmond Tutu.</p>
<p>Boesak said people like Tutu, who are revered by the white community for preaching reconciliation had become villians overnight for proposing this measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very interesting how white people love Desmond Tutu when he talks about forgiveness, but the moment he raises issues of justice they don&rsquo;t like him anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued: &#8220;They love Mandela more than Jesus &hellip; (because) Jesus is far too radical (on demanding social justice) and Mandela doesn&rsquo;t want to go that far because he understands people in this country.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he would say tomorrow what Jesus says they wouldn&rsquo;t like him anymore. So pretty soon they will just have Malema.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boesak said most whites felt they had already asked for forgiveness many times and could not do it all over again.</p>
<p>But equally guilty were the new black elite who were also trapped in a sense of false innocence through having made alliances with the elite.</p>
<p>&#8220;They (the black elite) have made alliances with the old wealthy elite, alliances against the masses of the people, and are part of the small 20 percent of the country&rsquo;s top elite who now gobble some 75 percent of our GDP, while 53 percent of our masses live in dire poverty and get 6 to 8 percent of what is left.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this class of new black elite was acting as if their wealth was the definition of South African democracy and freedom. Boesak said this was a disdain for the poor.</p>
<p>He said he would rather be labelled as heretical as he would continue to challenge some issues, adding that there was no substitute for justice.</p>

<p><br>
That&rsquo;s funny.  Whites who groveled are now getting a dose of the Diversity Curse.  </p>
<p>Blacks don&rsquo;t understand forgiveness and reconciliation. They only know the law of the jungle and scarcity:  get what you can right now because somebody else will get it if you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Their concept of morality is best understood in rap lyrics.</p>
<p>Even liberal Whites are slowly beginning to understand what &#8220;we&rsquo;ve come far, but we still have more work to do&#8221; means for them personally: slavery.  We won&rsquo;t interfere. They deserve it.  When chaos breaks out, I&rsquo;ll just stand down, because if I try to protect a Whitey where I live, I&rsquo;ll probably be defending my own enemy who enabled the Diversity Curse in the first place.  Why should I risk myself for Whiteys who put the interests of blacks ahead of their own White tribe?  Some social justice will be God-sent poetics.</p>
<p><br>
Whenever you hear a Whitey say &#8220;we must atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges,&#8221; you should say &#8220;Please, go ahead, I&rsquo;ll watch&hellip;&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Blacks benefited enormously under Apartheid. Blacks had the highest standard of living of any country in Sub Saharan Africa. That&rsquo;s why so many blacks continued to immigrate there. And as soon as they got the numbers they sought to establish this system of black supremacy. This is as strong a case for halting immigration as any I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Any disparity will eventually be exploited by the immigrants for political power.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to any liberals. &#8220;Social justice&#8221; is never about justice. It&rsquo;s nothing more than an excuse to stick one&rsquo;s hands in others&rsquo; pockets. Capitulation and appeasement won&rsquo;t stop this. It will only encourage further demands. This will only end when enough people are fed up with having their hard work and success used against them.</p>

		<p>Hopefully the new black elite will take away Allen Boesak&rsquo;s property and means of earning a living and he will end up homeless and eating garbage.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to live long enough to see it happen to the grandchildren of the affirmative action judges.</p>

		<p>I hate that word, social justice! All it means is take from White people and give it to nonwhite people, period. They don&rsquo;t just want our money and resources any longer, they want our very lives. I am beginning to believe that there are many Whites who will do exactly that! Give up their own lives and their children&rsquo;s lives for some god forsaken nonwhite. This is how insane many Whites have become in today&rsquo;s insane world.</p>

<p>Because the name Allan Boesak is racially ambiguous   &mdash;   to me it sounds like it could be Boer   &mdash;   I at first thought Boesak might be some self-hating South African white who had mentally &#8220;gone over to the other side.&#8221; </p>
<p>But no: turns out he&rsquo;s just another garden-variety, dime-a-dozen afro agitator. Here he is defending Julius Malema&rsquo;s right to sing the Bantustans&rsquo; favorite white-genocide anthem, &#8220;Shoot the Boer&#8221;   &mdash;   which Boesak assures us doesn&rsquo;t actually mean &#8220;Shoot the Boer&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/3lw88or" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/3lw88or</a></p>
<p>Basically, Boesak is Al Sharpton with a more pleasant accent. </p>

		<p>Always and everywhere &#8220;social justice&#8221; means taking stuff from white people and giving it to non-white people.  So white people with sense naturally turn a deaf ear to pleas for &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  In South Africa there are so many more blacks than whites that a &#8220;social justice&#8221; tax would provide little real benefit to the average black while it would impoverish all the whites.</p>
<p>As for the black elites, they are doing what the black elites do in every African nation.  Why should South Africa be any different?</p>

		<p>Denial of what? Whites in SA do not deserve a higher tax just because they are white. Surely, there are poorer whites in SA who can&rsquo;t afford such taxes? This &#8216;revenge mentality&rsquo; that blacks have is just disturbing. </p>

		<p>This is something for White people to keep uppermost in mind.  Here is a country that has been totally taken over by Blacks.  The exact opposite of what Allan Boesak says is true; the White man is indeed the victim.  The Blacks did not kill their prey but allow him to live so as extract tribute from their White victims<br>
<p><br>
This is what Blacks are all about in America.  They do not want equal opportunity. They do not want equal outcomes.  They want to steal everything the White man has.<br>
<p><br>
White people are foolish to think that MLK was fair minded.  He was 100% pro-Black.  He cared nothing about the rights and interests of White people.  MLK, the Civil Rights Movement, and all pro-Black assaults on the White man are undertaken to plunder the White man&rsquo;s goods. <br>

		<p>This is the same Alan Boesak, another &#8220;preacher&#8221;, who was found guilty of grand theft of charity goods when he lived a luxury life-style in a prestigious area of Cape Town with several new BMW motorcars and who was greeted by ANC politicians when he returned to face trial from the USA where he was delivering &#8220;anti-Apartheid sermons.  As someone who lived in SA for 24 years, the country is on the way to becoming another Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Make a note to iinsist that S.A. as well as Zimbabwe must be crossed off the future Christmas present AID lists.</p>

		<p> Nobody admires Robert Hayne and John C. Calhoun more than I do. </p>
<p>John C. Calhoun made a fatal miscalculation about the requirements for a White Republic.  He said it rested on the foundation of African slavery.  Whites must be freed from manual labor so they can become educated enough to vote properly and make wise decisions.  Read lots of Plato, Jefferson, Madison, Gibbon, etc.  Who has time to read when they are dog tired from working in the hot Dixie sun?</p>
<p>But the flaw in Calhoun&rsquo;s conception was that he assumed that the slaves would always be enslaved.  That&rsquo;s a risky bet to make for the foundation of a republic.   Slaves can become free, eventually, and then the republic will begin a slow descent into chaos as the slaves breed fast enough to take over everything.</p>
<p>We are seeing the truth of Calhoun.  You can&rsquo;t have a republic with African freedmen running around making a dangerous nuisance of themselves.</p>
<p>Our republic is dying, and we will see the horrors of its death throes.   If you base a republic on something that is transitional, you should expect your republic to transition as well, and into something that looks like the worst of Africa. <br>

		<p>Yes, Boesak is a &#8220;colored&#8221; in SA lingo. Of mixed race, like our beloved Obama, and yes there are many poor whites in SA. I&rsquo;m sure many would like to leave but lack the means. Malema is a very dangerous tyrant, in my opinion. He has all the hallmarks of the notorious African tin pot dictators. This is the kind of guy who would whip the masses into a Rwanda-esque genocide. When I hear or read the word &#8220;uhuru&#8221;, that&rsquo;s the guy I think of. </p>

		<p>I beg the pardon of any who might take offense, but (at this moment), I am tiring of thoughts of South Africa, Zimbabwe and the rest of the dying white holdings in Africa.<br>
No, not because I don&rsquo;t care about the whites. Far from it.<br>
It is because, one, Africa has been returned to the blacks. They are mopping up the last vestiges of white civilization, before fully cannibalizing themselves. Is there REALLY any hope for whiteness in Africa? I don&rsquo;t see how. Tell me if I&rsquo;m wrong. The world spit on White Africans a long time ago, and gave them over to the black horror. Their time is done. Come! Emigrate t the USA. You KNOW you don&rsquo;t need papers. Uncle Sucker has no immigration laws!</p>
<p>TWO: The USA is dying, but MIGHT have a chance of survival in some altered form. <br>
Isn&rsquo;t this what we need to focus on? <br>

		<p> This reminds me of a caller to a weekend radio talk show. Reparations for slavery had become the hot topic. The white host ask what blacks wanted from reparations. A black female called in and with an angery voice told the host she wanted his car, house,personal possessions and bank account. That, she wanted it all. The host was stunned into silence. Dead air for at less 10 seconds. The host quickly went to a break. How much do blacks want? Everything and your liberty too. </p>

		<p>I used to live in South Africa where Allan Boesak was frequently in the news. He is of mixed race and was a leading figure in the &#8216;struggle&rsquo;against apartheid. He is said to have a doctorate in Liberation theology. He married a white woman who had a business to do with  making films. He handled funds donated by the Danish Church for the benefit of black people but used some of them to purchase film equipment for his wife. Danchurch brought a case against him and he was sentenced to three years in Pollsmoor prison near Cape Town. </p>

		<p>#1 Read Anthony Jacob&rsquo;s WMTA! - Well, us similar-thinking whites need to group together and watch our weak destroy themselves.  As is often said, revenge is best served cold.</p>
<p>Whites, by and large, no longer allow themselves independent critical thought.  When all you desire is being popular or fitting in, you are no longer in control of your own destiny.  Whites are also the only race that exhibits empathy, sympathy, or guilt to a large degree.  Of course these qualities were also required for the building of great socities like ours, and ours alone.  But they only work in homogenous societies.  Where culture, beliefs, and behavior are pretty much the same or very, very similar.<br>

<p>Wow&hellip;..I couldn&rsquo;t agree with this statement more.  Whites should wake up to the fact that they did everything for blacks and now are literally hunted for sport in the country they built.  They rolled over and never finished the race war blacks started there and many whites are suffering.  They act as if this displacement in their own land has no consequences for whites&hellip;as the rapes and murders of whites are blurred (as crime), then trivialized, then rendered invalid by police and courts who, not only won&rsquo;t respond, but are often involved.</p>
<p>SA whites have unfinished business.  In order to live peacefully (or at all), they are going to have to move blacks from at least a portion of south africa and then defend that land.</p>

		<p>I get a kick out of the worldwide chuckling and condescension over the so-called &#8220;undeserved&#8221; new white sense of victimhood.  As though it never occured to the multiculti leftists that there could be some blowback after decades of gradual disenfranchisement, guaranteed socioeconomic handicapping, and endless assaults on any attempt by whites to insulate themselves in their own communities and continue to enjoy their special set of skills and attributes roundly criticized as &#8220;white privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as &#8220;social justice,&#8221; it&rsquo;s just another of the made-up verbal clubs they love to beat us with.  It sounds so good; too bad it&rsquo;s a meaningless term.  Justice is quantifiable; a redress of a perceived grievance that settles that grievance.  There is no way to quantify the grievances of the non-whites en masse, both real and imagined, and even if this could be quantified they won&rsquo;t be happy until they take everything from us, as evidenced by Turtle&rsquo;s comment.  That&rsquo;s not justice, that&rsquo;s theft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social justice&#8221; is a crock.  It&rsquo;s an interchangeable term for &#8220;income redistribution&#8221; meant to be more pleasing to white ears.</p>

		<p>Blacks&rsquo; ideas of justice, no matter what country they are from, is that the Whites pay, pay, pay for eternity for a past that most present-day Whites had nothing to do with.</p>
<p>Their sense of justice is different from ours. This is why when liberals claim that &#8220;all people want the same thing in life&#8221; this is false. Nonwhites&rsquo; definitions of justice, equality, fairness, and other abstract concepts are different than White peoples&rsquo; defintions of these concepts.

		<p>12-Anon: &#8220;The USA is dying, but MIGHT have a chance of survival in some altered form. Isn&rsquo;t this what we need to focus on?&#8221;</p>
<p>- Yes. Sounds like a good topic for a convention&hellip;</p>
<p>Also, regarding SA: &#8220;Emigrate to the USA. You KNOW you don&rsquo;t need papers&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>- I agree here as well.  If any SA Whites are reading this, just get here and keep low for a while, maybe have a few children, you and your family should be able to stay forever. You&rsquo;ll then be able to help us save a part of the U.S. for White folks.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They make me ill. This is why I do not like being around other Whites because most are so ignorant about race and they rush to be nice to any black and other nonwhite.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of people complain about the legal immigrants, especially the ones who belong to very corrupt and crooked ethnic groups.<br>
But at least they don&rsquo;t hate their fellow Whites.  My neighborhood has become Persian in the last 20 years.  They have the same feelings about race as we at amrem do.</p>
<p>White Americans do nothing but excuse the blacks and hispancis who rob and car jack them. A our local DMV the Persians deamnd respect from the surly black clerks.  And they get it.</p>
<p>The White Americans just stand there like meek sheep.</p>

		<p>Also, regarding SA: &ldquo;Emigrate to the USA. You KNOW you don&rsquo;t need papers&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exactly how would one manage this? I thought with the new Unpatriotic Act they scan you down to the very last letter on arrival? Do you mean land in the USA and never return?</p>
<p>If the USA functions like S.A. the paper trial does not end at the airport. Yo need it for opening bank accounts, school enrollment, employment, medical, and so on. For a single male person with no attachments this might just work, but otherwise?</p>
<p>I am just asking, we are not so informed about the USA. </p>
