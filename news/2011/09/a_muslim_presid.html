<h1>A Muslim President, After All</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Investors, September 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics, blacks and others among President Obama&rsquo;s base may be abandoning him, but Muslims are holding fast. Apparently, theirs is a special bond born of shared interests.</p>
<p>When Barack Hussein Obama first stepped into office in January 2009, he had 92% approval among blacks, 75% approval among Hispanics and 58% approval among whites, according to Gallup.</p>
<p>Since then, his monthly approval has dropped eight points among blacks, 27 points among Hispanics and 25 points among whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Polls show Obama also has lost ground with independents, while young people have cooled off on him.</p>
<p>He is losing much of his 2008 base of voters with one notable exception: Muslim-Americans. They remain exceedingly loyal to the president. In fact, their enthusiasm for Obama has swelled.</p>
<p>Last month, Pew Research Center released a survey of U.S. Muslims that was almost universally overlooked. It found that Muslims overwhelmingly approve of the way Obama is handling his job as president. Fully three-quarters (76%) favor him, compared with just 46% of the general public.</p>
<p>President Bush, in contrast, garnered a lowly 15% approval rating among Muslim-Americans. &#8220;Muslim-Americans clearly see a friend in Obama,&#8221; Pew said in its report.</p>

		<p>Another feeble attempt to slow down the Muslim takeover-</p>
<p>With uproar in Cobb school, Georgia may pull lesson about Islam<br>
https://www.ajc.com/news/cobb/with-uproar-in-cobb-1192325.html</p>
<p>When the Muslims win this one, look for Hussein Obama to give a speech at the Atlanta mosque about America become more diverse, more welcoming of change and diversity, more vibrant, more interfaith, and more reflecting of the global inclusivity that enriches our lives and is taking America forward to a better future when White Privilege no longer has its greedy hands on the systemic power and institutional leadership.</p>
<p>Even the hardy Tennesseans couldn&rsquo;t keep a mosque out of Tullahoma.  Every time the Muslims want something, they eventually get it, because you can&rsquo;t trust the elites in power to look out for your interests ever again.  They will sell out to &#8220;transformative change&#8221; faster than George Wallace and Lester Maddox did.<br>

		<p>That&rsquo;s weird.  Obama is bombing as many Muslim countries as George W. Bush ever did.<br>

		<p>Obama seems to believe in the multi-cult (multiculturalism), and he&rsquo;s willing to push that kind of agenda. It&rsquo;s no wonder Muslims will back him, as Muslims believe in the multi-cult too and refuse to go back to Muslim countries. </p>

		<p>I completely agree with &#8220;MR&#8221;:  this is weird.  Obama has been bombing, killing and torturing innocent Arabas (Muslim AND Christian) with abandon&hellip;and the Muslims still like him?  He just got through assasinatinmg an American citizen who is sympathetic to Muslims (without evidence or trial by jury, by the way) and they still support him?</p>
<p>IF this is true, and I say &#8220;if&#8221;, then those hapless people must be way beyond stupid.</p>
