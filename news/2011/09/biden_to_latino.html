<h1>Biden to Latinos: You Were Here First</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Julie Mason, Politico, September 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Biden on Thursday hosted the annual Hispanic Heritage Month reception at the Naval Observatory. Guests included about 100 Hispanic veterans, active duty service members, elected officials and others. The music was classical Mexican.</p>
<p>&#8220;You all were here before us,&#8221; Biden said, according to a pool report.</p>
<p>Biden noted his own background as the descendant of Irish immigrants, saying, &#8220;We come from a similar circumstance. It&rsquo;s about family, it&rsquo;s about faith and it&rsquo;s about basic things.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The contributions being made to this country by Hispanic Americans is well over 400 years old,&#8221; said Biden. &#8220;We are acting like somehow it is brand new, but you know that America is much richer and more vibrant because of these contributions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mestizos are a mix of Europeans and &#8220;Native&#8221;(the Solutrean hypothesis would mean that Europeans actually got here first, but that&rsquo;s just a theory)Americans.  Short of time travel, I don&rsquo;t see how they could have arrived in the Americas before their Iberian creators.  </p>

		<p>What a fanny kisser and deprecator of Anglo-Americans! My family came here in 1630, Plymouth! </p>
<p>Many of the Mexicans are of Spanish descent. Apaches &amp; Comanches depopulated the indigenous population of Northern Mexico through their extensive and vicious raids of other Indian peoples and Mexicans so most of the people who are really from there are of Spanish descent. Most of the people coming up here from Chihuhua are a dark skinned variety of Spaniards (probably Andaluzes). The Indians and Mestizos are from other parts like Oaxaca.</p>
<p>Speaking of Apaches and Comanches (and Utes), look at the settlment maps of New Mexico and the San Luis Valley before 1848 and after. There was a tremendous expansion of Hispanic settlements because after the U.S. took responisbility for that area Indian raids were no longer the great danger that they were during Spanish control and the 27 years that those territories were part of Mexico (Mexican independence September 16, 1821, U.S. control 1848-2011&hellip;).</p>
<p>Are these issues important? I do not think that even those of you who are alarmed about immigration and race relations really realize the full implications of these problems. </p>
<p>Look at what happened in the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo drug smuggling zone, Croatia, etc.). Look at what recently happened in Kyrgistan between the Kyrgiz turkic people and Uzbek turkic people. They are actually from the same major ethnolinguistic origins and original nomadic steppe background. Look at what has always happened in every single ethnic hodgepodge nation in which the majority group falls or is forced below 70% of the population. </p>
<p>This has happened every time everywhere, no exceptions.</p>

		<p>Joe Biden is locking up votes for the Democratic Party by making feel good comments to the Hispanic community.  However, it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference who was &#8220;here first&#8221;.  The important thing is what people are doing with their lives right now to materially improve the country and make it a more prosperous and tolerable place to live, now and in the future.  As far as Biden&rsquo;s claim that Amerindians were here first, consider the case of the Kennewick Man.  The 9,400-year-old skeleton of the European-like Kennewick Man was discovered in Washington State in 1996.  The archeological site on which this skeleton was found was quickly covered up by the Army Corps of Engineers with 250 feet of rock and soil before further archeological investigations could be carried out.  You can watch a 5 minute video about the Kennewick Man here: https://goo.gl/R1lMP.  Like I said, the important thing is what people, and by extension, groups of people, are doing right now to improve or degrade civilization.</p>

		<p>Joe Biden is the closest thing we have to Alfred E. Newman in American politics. Proof that if you keep getting elected and manage to stick around long enough in politics, sheer dumb luck will find you vaulted into a position you neither deserve nor are qualified for. A typical second string hack, Biden just keeps spouting one stupid thing after another, but it&rsquo;s become so common for him to make a fool of himself barely anyone pays attention. He and Obama are one stooge short of an act. </p>

		<p>I guess Biden doesn&rsquo;t know his history. Actually, white europeans were in North America, Central America, and South America before the hispanics. Besides, hispanics are hybrids. That is why so many of them classify them as being white. They also have many diseases because of hybridity. In fact, white europeans were in these continents up to 6,000 years before the American Indians even arrived. Another thing that needs to be taken consideration of is the simple fact that hispanics actually established nothing. They didn&rsquo;t form any governments or cultures. The presence of governments and cultures were already here because whites were here first. The only people that have ever made governments, cultures, and civilizations were white people.</p>

<p>Someone needs to call him out on this.  There were no latinos in the original 13 colonies.  There were a few SPANIARDS here and there, or their white children, but by no means were there amerindian mexicans running around Georgia, Vermont or Ohio!</p>
<p>In fact, the Mexican Cession and annexation of Texas - do you know how many Mexican citizens were in all that territory from California to Texas?  20,000!  This is what the scholars say.  That&rsquo;s not even enough people to fill a small sized town!</p>
<p>And the majority of those Mexicans were what?  WHITE descendants of Spaniards!</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t address an audience of Dominican mestizos, Bolivian peasants, Mexican amerindians from the Yucatan and Cubans and say that ANY OF THEM were &#8220;here first.&#8221;  Especially since those in that audience were ALL BORN SOMEWHERE ELSE!</p>
<p>Is Biden making the mistake of lumping all people who speak Spanish together in one big happy family and treating them like they are all SPANIARDS?</p>

<p>He didn&rsquo;t mention Amerinds because he obviously lumps all North Americans regardless of geographic location of particular tribes as Americans and therefore the same as Mexicans.  This sort of gymnastic logic is the same type that wants us to grasp the reality of the multiracial white, etc.  I can only guess that decades of drug use by liberals in general have created the sort of fuzzy logic that allows all sorts of vague associations to gain political traction if chanted long enough.</p>

		<p>Can Joe Biden please point out the Hispanic signatories of the Declaration of Independence?, Can he point out the original Jamestown and Plymouth colonists with Hispanic names?</p>
<p>Can he find any Hispanic names at all if he studies the tax rolls, census returns etc of the original colonies through to the early Republic?</p>
<p>Now, I am full aware that to be a professional politician is to be a professional liar, make no bones about that, that&rsquo;s what politicians do for a living.But in terms of making the odd lie here, the odd lie there, dropping little falsehoods about the economy and your opponents etc, Biden enters a new realm of utter brazenness and shamelessness.</p>

		<p>They were here first? Even if true, so what?</p>
<p>1.  The people crossing the border from Mexico were not the people who originally inhabited the US. Amerindians were not a unified nation with rights to travel and settle freely before European colonization.</p>
<p>2.  Being genetically related to the people who first populated an area is not justification for the current right to possess. Even the Amerindians understood that property is acquired through exploration and conquest.</p>

<p>With the numerous anti-white Hispanic organizations rife within this country, who openly advocate the overthrow of existing authority to create an Aztlan, and others who advocate killing whites if they resist, I&rsquo;m just wondering if this pitiful fool realizes he has just encouraged more of it, likely at a higher pitch on a more intense level.</p>

		<p>Brown &#8220;Latino&#8221; culture has offered literally nothing to the advancement of America. Almost all of its &#8220;benefits&#8221; have come to us indirectly through the Spanish side of their culture.</p>
<p>If the average white American could get over the fallacy that Spanish = brown Mestizo, we could all share a good laugh as we all realized that the only thing Mexicans have ever contributed was the European, white side of their culture.</p>
<p>Also of interesting note is that &#8220;classical Mexican music&#8221; is borrowed heavily from Czech and German culture.</p>

		<p>The simple fact is that the United States was founded and built by people of British/Northern European decent, not by the Indians who were here when the Pligrams landed at Plymouth Rock.  That is a fact.  It certainly wasn&rsquo;t built by what we today call Mexicans.  I am tired of the lies.

<p>But we have to keep reminding people what the number two Democrat had to say about the economy. Just play it over and over and over again, until it sinks into people&rsquo;s heads. </p>

He is from an area in the northern part of the state, near Wilmington, where almost all liberals in the state live.  I doubt if he had many dealing with Hispanics until he went to Washington.

		<p>Pilgrims came here in 1620, way before the Spanish - undisputed. But remember,Christopher Columbus, and most of the first navigators to the Americas were Italian, not Spanish or English. <br>
The Italian navigators were here well over 100 years before the English, and were the first to settle in North and South America as well as the Caribbean. Where does the word &#8220;America&#8221; come from - Amerigo Vespucci, the famous Italian navigator that was the first to argue that there was a continent between Europe and Asia. Let&rsquo;s not forget John Cabot - born in Genoa around 1450, and a citizen of Venice Italy. Cabot&rsquo;s actual name was Giovanni Caboto. He and Sabastian Cabot commanded English ships on voyages during Tudor times. John Cabot (about 1450–98) was an experienced Italian seafarer who came to live in England during the reign of Henry VII. And while we are on the subject, remind Mr. Biden that Philip Mazzei, an Italian Statesman, who lived in Virginia and was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, helped draft the Declaration of Independence. From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>This contribution was acknowledged by John F. Kennedy in his book A Nation of Immigrants, in which he states that<br>
&ldquo;The great doctrine &#8216;All men are created equal&rsquo;incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson. A few alleged scholars try to discredit Mazzei as the creator of this statement and idea, saying that &#8220;there is no mention of it anywhere until after the Declaration was published&#8221;. This phrase appears in Italian in Mazzei&rsquo;s own hand, written in Italian, several years prior to the writing of the Declaration of Independence. Mazzei and Jefferson often exchanged ideas about true liberty and freedom. No one man can take complete credit for the ideals of American democracy.&#8221;</p>

		<p>400 years of contributions I am sure.  But the quantity and quality is eclipsed by other groups.  International recognition, political leadership, sustaining contributions are the mark to be evaluated.  <br>
The bell curve is an immutable law of nature.  Some are shifted to the right, and others to the left.  Do you know where your children are??</p>

		<p>Hispanics were not here first. Hominds were and after that primitive Ameri-indians. Hispanics are a long way down the food chain and as a rule are from tribes not even originating in the United States. That would go to the whites whom intermarried with Native Americans tribes in this country in the Westward expansion.</p>

		<p>Does Biden seem to forget that the Hispanics he is speaking with are on average, 60% White?</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/NSG3N" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/NSG3N</a></p>
<p>So shouldn&rsquo;t they feel 60% guilty for what THEIR ancestors (not mine) did to their other ancestors?  They descended from the &#8220;evil Whites&#8221; who conquered them, yet I - who is of no relation - have to feel sorry for it?  Please!</p>

		<p>Excuse me, Italian American.  The first Europeans to reach North America (before it was so named) were the Norsemen.  Look up the name Leif Ericson.  It is even argued that Columbus was part Polish.  And, correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, there were no Italian colonies in North America.</p>

<p><br>
That is correct, only because there was no powerful country known as &#8220;Italy&#8221;  which was capable of trans-oceanic expansion.   The Italian peninsula was only a collection of competing city-states.</p>
<p>But since we are splitting hairs here, it is worth noting that the VERY FIRST, uh, &#8220;Spanish&#8221; or European colonies on the South American mainland (outside Brazil) were awarded to and developed by   &mdash;   Germans!   (E.g. Santa Marta in Colombis).</p>
<p>That little oddity was due to the fact that the King of Spain was also the Emperor of Germany (Charles V). He rewarded his German supporters in his wars.  So, German colonists settled in South America even before Spaniards!!!</p>

		<p><i>You all were here before us</i> Biden said</p>
<p>Shall we ask Kennewick Man?  Oh, can&rsquo;t do that, he was buried by those Obama claims were here first!!</p>
<p>https://www.lauralee.com/glover2.htm</p>
<p>How about the 13,000 year old skulls in Mexico? Obama speaks Nahuatl, right?</p>
<p><i>The oldest human remains found in the Americas were recently &#8216;discovered&rsquo; in the storeroom of Mexico&rsquo;s National Museum of Anthropology. Found in central Mexico in 1959, the five skulls were radiocarbon dated by a team of researchers from the United Kingdom and Mexico and found to be 13,000 years old. They pre-date the Clovis culture by a couple thousand years, adding to the growing evidence against the Clovis-first model for the first peopling of the Americas.</i></p>
<p><b>Of additional significance is the shape of the skulls, which are described as long and narrow, very unlike those of modern Native Americans.</b></p>
<p><i>The contributions being made to this country by Hispanic Americans is (SIC) well over 400 years old.</i></p>
<p>Did you plagiarize that little speech too?</p>
<p>How very &#8220;reconquista&#8221; of you Biden La Gaffe! Why do you want to recreate severed heads here? How can anyone have respect for anyone who does such craven groveling?</p>
<p>Maybe you say so many stupid things because your hair plugs are screwed in too tight!!</p>
<p>Mexico fought and lost a war against the United Stated, signed a treaty and accepted money.  This does not give Mexicans the right to enter the US illegally.</p>
<p>Keep talking, Rimshot, every gaffe you make is a gift that keeps in giving and helps your boss out of a job in 2012.</p>
<p><i>When the stock market crashed, Franklin D. Roosevelt got on the television and didn&rsquo;t just talk about the, you know, the princes of greed. He said, &#8216;Look, here&rsquo;s what happened.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, Plugs, the msm won&rsquo;t ever call you to task.  That is only for the likes of Dan Quayle&hellip;</p>

		<p>The illegals were in Mexico first, not the United States.  Our aboriginal people are the Sioux, Apache, Comanche, Mohawks, Ojibway, Navaho, Seminole, etc.  Had the illegals marched in before bleeding heart white people settled the place they would have had their hides skinned by Apache and Comanche who believed in defending their turf.<br>

<p>No argument that Leif was first, and but he came not from mainland Europe, but the North Atlantic, a much smaller journey to Newfoundland.  I never said there were Italian colonies, but my point was that the Spanish, the English, and the French all hired Italians as their navigators and Captains, since they were considered the &#8220;experts&#8221; in navigation. The journey of Columbus changed the world as we know it - Leif Ericson&rsquo;s journey had no significant impact on the world - if any impact at all.  We don&rsquo;t celebrate Leif Ericon&rsquo;s Day since his &#8220;discovery&#8221; had zero impact. </p>
<p>As far as Columbus being Polish - c&rsquo;mon, it has even been argued that he was Portuguese. People try to argue these points because they are jealous that the Italians have had such significant contributions in science, exploration, art, and medicine. The Italians didn&rsquo;t establish colonies during the journey of Columbus since they were experiencing a Renaissance - something the Polish or the Portuguese never had. </p>
