			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joe Newby, Examiner, September 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While speaking with Tavis Smiley of PBS, Texas Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee said conservative bloggers should &#8220;shut up&#8221; and &#8220;stop playing racial politics.&#8221;</p>
<p>This from a member of the caucus that does little else but play the race card.</p>
<p>Seconds later, Jackson Lee went on to say that buy American should be &#8220;buy African American.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also said that if Obama&rsquo;s jobs bill is passed, that contractors who &#8220;do not look like&#8221; her need to make sure that if they get federal money, their workforce &#8220;better be reflective of those suffering double-digit unemployment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t consider it discrimination, I don&rsquo;t consider it affirmative action,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Smiley and Jackson Lee were responding to recent headlines over the President&rsquo;s remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus last Saturday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several conservative blogs noted Obama&rsquo;s words, but they all amount to the same thing  &mdash;  &#8220;stop complaining and get in line.&#8221;  Smiley may not like it, but that was the thrust of President Obama&rsquo;s message to the Black Caucus.</p>

		<p>About that one.Wow- What a great rebuttal to those adverse bloggers. &#8220;Shut up!&#8221; She must have spent a lot of time thinking about that one. And by the way darling&hellip; it is affirmative action, you imbecile! Like so many other posters have claimed the left constantly tries to change the rules in their favor when it comes to poor minorities. Cry me a river. I&rsquo;ll bet if this race hustler went through the Appalachian area she would see &#8220;double digit unemployment&#8221;. But somehow I doubt she would offer any to those people. Jackson Lee- beat it.. You make me sick.</p>

		<p>The only thing the African-American community has learned to do well in the last 50 years is to grift off of the public and now that is in jeopardy.  I think Shiela Jackson Lee believes that white people are still afraid of her loud angry black woman routine where if we give her &#8220;community&#8221; some spending cash she will be quiet for a while.  The CBC can go get lost.    </p>

<p>Remember when Jesse Jackson was standing under the bridge in New Orleans shouting that all the suffering Africanisma  after Katrina were caused by racism?</p>
<p>(The Episcopal Diocese down there even came out with a statement that those Whiteys who escaped Katrina only could do so because they had benefitted from racist white privilege that gave them the resources to flee.)</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you remember that when you heard Jesse you yelled back at him through the TV, &#8220;Jesse, please don&rsquo;t stop talking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesse, Shelia, and all the other race hustlers are our best friends.  They make our White liberal elite enemies look like idiots.  We must take greater advantage of our opportunities. Students on campus should start a petition demanding that their Officers of Diversity and Inclusion condemn the latest race hustler for &#8220;causing thinking persons to reexamine their commitment to Diversity, and possibly rededicate themselves to honoring and growing our White privileges&#8221;.<br>

		<p>Some may be outraged by her words and tactics, but her boldness is simply reflective of the permissive society we have become with regard to discrimination and affirmative action against whites.  The very fact that she can say this and remain a force, remain in office, remain outspoken, speaks volumes about what sort of country we now live in.  She gets a pass as does everyone like her.  What should be done when hiring occurs is to ignore her demands.  Alas, the opposite will happen.  Those hired will be disproportionately minorities.  I know it, and you know it.</p>

		<p>Age doth not wither her.  The lively badinage of witty oneliners is something we conservative whites really enjoy, one of the many things that make us so doggone great!  Why should we give it up?  Sometimes, I almost feel sorry for those not white like me, but the mood soon passes.  For like the Victorian lass of dubious parentage, they are no better, that is, whiter than they should be.</p>

<p>Hold that thought.</p>
<p>The new dark-tanned darling of lamestream conservatism said yesterday, the once upon a time pizza jockey who loves the number nine, claims that the reason black voters vote Democrat almost all the time and almost monolithically is because they are &#8220;brainwashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tell you, the American Democrat Party must have a propaganda machine that Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Mao couldn&rsquo;t envy enough in the aggregate, if it has been so successful into &#8220;brainwashing&#8221; a certain race of voters to vote almost entirely for their party since 1932.  Makes me wonder why we ever had axes to grind against Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and Mao   &mdash;   Maybe they should have &#8220;liberated&#8221; us at that rate instead of us liberating Germany and Russia and wherever.</p>
<p>Perhaps the pizza jockey needs to hear an alternate and perhaps crazy theory.  Blacks vote almost all Democrat almost all the time because they are relatively sane (though definitely not high IQ) people, and they&rsquo;re voting for the party which gives them more tangible and intangible government goodies than the other party, in spite of how hard the other party tries to do that.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t take the pizza jockey&rsquo;s straw poll victory to mean anything.  I still hold to my prediction that he gets no better than a 5% average in primary states and no better than 10% in any one state.  Straw polls mean nothing.  Unfortunately, when it gets down to brass tacks and real people voting, it will all come down to &#8220;who have they heard of?&#8221;  Unfortunately for us, that means either the Rickroller or Massachusetts Mittens, because they can hustle the most money from one interested treason lobby or another.</p>
<p>Speaking of lobbies, BTW, I have a better chance of hanging the moon than the pizza jockey&rsquo;s &#8220;Brought to you by the number 9&#8221; plan has of actually becoming law, even though I like it in theory and most of the substance, though I think there still needs to be a capital gains tax and a reverse stair-stepped one to deter quick asset flipping in turn to deter job outsourcing (borrowing Ross Perot&rsquo;s idea).  If there was any hint of the 9-9-9 plan taking credible legs in Congress, the tax lawyers, CPAs and their buddies both in and out of government would launch a head-spinning lobbying putsch to kill it.  If you think the open borders lobby is bad, and for those of you who (incorrectly, IMHO) think the &#8220;I&#8221; country lobbying megalopolis is powerful?  Wait until you get a whiff of the many many people making a lot of money off the complicated and convoluted tax laws, Warren Buffet is an example.  Better to salami slice the big bad system out of existence one piece at a time.</p>

		<p>Again, BEAUTIFUL NEWS.<br>
The CBC (Coloreds bereft of conscience) is peeing it&rsquo;s pants with anger. Obama is a lame duck already, and has no friends. <br>
The whites of the USA are sick of being broke and listening to retardates like this crook, LEE.</p>
<p>Better times straight ahead (perhaps through a crapstorm, but definitely better times)</p>
<p>That is, if YOU do more than complain. Vote anti Democrat. (You don&rsquo;t have to support Republicans). Nail them to the wall after you elect them. <br>
Show up at political events with signs, video cameras&hellip;Shout  out questions. BOO and cheer. Make yourself known. Call your representatives. Speak some almost- acceptable race realism every few days.<br>
Cripes, this is like trying to get a really fat person to change their habits, while they cry it&rsquo;s no use, while huffing down another box of twinkies.<br>
Look, it ain&rsquo;t easy. But if a bunch of flea- ridden college students brought the white order, in all it&rsquo;s power down, can&rsquo;t the smarter and more capable whites snatch it back, especially when the libtards have fallen down, hard? <br>
Time is NOW.</p>

		<p>It is basically all big talk and pure nonsense.  What are the blacks going to do when the whites say no more?  Sooner or later the end of the gravy train is coming.  It is just a matter of when.  It is against cosmic law to live off someone else&rsquo;s labor.  This whole farce got started out of the make believe white guilt and black slavery fantasy in this country.  This whole debacle has cost the taxpayers $17 trillion and continuing, cheated the whites out of good jobs and a good education, more black on white crimes, set back society due to the dumbing down of the work place and educational system and regressed the blacks due to them developing a welfare mentality.</p>

		<p>Is there anything more offensive than a race hustler? I particularly abhor the White variety, whose anti-white racist rants and veneration of all things black should, in my humble opinion, be rewarded with a quick trip to Forest Lawn. Take Temple University journalism graduate SHANNON McDONALD, the fair-skinned darling of black Philadelphia, who imposed herself upon the Philadelphia police department during a student ride-along, and then used the experience to expose supposed white police &#8220;bigotry&#8221; against the city&rsquo;s noble African-American population. Today, this quince-faced little troll (look up her internet profile to see what I mean) inhabits a WHITE city neighborhood (it&rsquo;s okay to sing their praises in print, Shannon, but after all, actually LIVING amongst them is carrying things a bit too far, n&rsquo;est pas?). She is also employed by public TV/Radio station WHYY (when this comes out, it should do wonders for their fund-raising efforts with conservative white viewers)and - get this - SHE IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT TEMPLE UNIVERSITY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT SHE HOLDS A MERE BACHELOR&rsquo;S DEGREE! (I guess this goes to show how rewarding it can be to betray the confidences of white police officers in order to score points with a local minority.)That this obnoxious toad is still safely walking the streets is a testimony to the amazing forebearance of the city&rsquo;s caucasian population - but my guess is that once the worm turns (And it will, Shannon dear, it will) Ms. McDonald would be well advised to head for the hills, lest she find herself part of the supporting structure of the city&rsquo;s Museum of Tolerance (and I&rsquo;m not speaking figuratively, either!) Sic Semper Tyrannus, sweetheart.</p>

		<p>Look at her nose.  Observe the flaring nostrils, the width of the nose, the sloping forehead, the prognathous jaw. Clearly, race is a biological reality and not a social construct.  If you imported her picture into Photoshop and altered the hue and contrast to match that of a European, it still would not be a <br>

<p>I agree with #10 - white enablers have forced low IQ polito-thugs like her to run wild. And then whites wonder why things are going down the drain.</p>

<p>You said it!  Oh yeah, they can call me racist until they run out of oxygen, I will not vote for <i>anyone ever</i> who wants to flush more money down that drain.  How many trillions have we spent to try to make African Americans a part of Western society?  And it has achieved <i>nothing</i>.  As we can see with Katrina, all those trillions of dollars, all those schools, free this and that, all fade like a fart in the wind the moment the overseer isn&rsquo;t looking.  I don&rsquo;t care what names they call me, I don&rsquo;t want to give them another dime.</p>

		<p>How would Jared Taylor like being married to something like that and have to wake up in the morning beside it or go to bed with it? </p>
<p>Now you know why her species of males all want a white female who are a trillion times better looking and superior in every feature that is the ones who havent been brainwashed and destroyed and turned into fat slob liberals by the watching the Oprah show and BET for the past 25 years to be such busy bodies. </p>
<p>The key to keeping blacks with their own race would be to invent products that genetically alter the traits of these black females and beautify them. <br>
Facial recontructive surgery paid for by taxpayers would be worth the waste of money if it would help the situation. Why has this not been thought of? </p>
<p>Seriously, black females are in dire need of physical altercations to make them attractive to their black male and keep him away from white females as Hollywood and the media or education has been attempting to misgenenate for the past 500 yrs since we must believe that this was what was behind it all when African slavery was brought to the New World. </p>
<p>Since whites are stuck with them then why not do something to beautify the black females recontructively? We know mulatto females are attractive to blacks moreso than non-mulattos. </p>
<p>Another more scientific method could be to use medical technology to impregnate black females with sperm that would make their offspring 100% white caucasoid. <br>
We know this is above Taylors head and he could never imagine this but reality must be faced. <br>
Something has to be done. </p>
<p>Surely advanced medical technology could use white genes while removing black genes in artificial insimination to make black females have white caucasoid babies.</p>
<p>This may come off as racist of course to the pc crowd but clearly all blacks desire to be white and curse their own race secretly and themselves.</p>
<p><br>
Whites must come up with something before their race expires due to misgenation and clearly the white brain is the superior brain on the planet as opposed to the red yellow or black race brains obviously. </p>
<p>Of course this social scientific medical technology would be voluntary but could be sold to blacks as genetically altering their race to be transformed into being white.</p>
<p>Scientific medical technology could even be used to convert and transform black on black couples offspring into white babies. </p>
<p>What if scientists could develop a way to eliminate the black race by turning them white or as white as they could get? They could still call themselves black since their chonological past would prove it. </p>
<p>The idea is to improve the genetic traits and looks of the black race and this is exactly what they want anyway. </p>
<p>There are many possibilities that need to be investigated but the bottom line is whites must use their brains to solve this dire crisis before they are eliminated. Blacks want the white traits and genes so why not give them what they want but only with medical technological altercation?</p>
<p>Micheal Jackson ring a bell? Why do all blacks look up to him as their god? Clearly he was telling them something and this was to fix your nose lips face and skin. All you have to do is look at the billions in skin whitening products that blacks use and this includes hair straighening products. Johnson and Johnson is their savior. </p>
<p>All black females need their noses and lips fixed to become more attractive to their own.</p>
<p>Wake up whites. Fix up the black female and you solve much of the problem and keep blacks with blacks. </p>
<p>Also look into the genetics of making their babies white with advanced medical technology removing the black traits during conception.<br>
Test tube babies would solve a lot. </p>
<p>Use your brain white man or otherwise your race is extinct. </p>

		<p>For the last half-century, American blacks have learned that the way to get action is to scream discrimination and racism.  The ploy has now worn paper-thin, but they apparently don&rsquo;t know any other direction in which to go.  They have achieved the highest goal of which their community is capable  &mdash;  the election of a black President.  That aint workin&rsquo; out so well, so they&rsquo;re wallowing in frustration and anger, lashing out at whites and even at Obama.  <br>
If the black approval rating of the Prez fell dramatically, he might pay more than symbolic attention to their demands.  Otherwise, why should he?  He knows he has to have the votes of at least a fair percentage of whites, and he&rsquo;s pretending a lot of concern for Hispanics.  <br>
Blacks will, lemming-like, vote for another black  &mdash;  and he knows it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Surely advanced medical technology could use white genes while removing black genes in artificial insimination to make black females have white caucasoid babies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Your post was very funny. Don&rsquo;t know if it was trying to be. A medical solution might not be as difficult as what you are proposing, however. If enough black female fetuses were aborted (a practice quite common all across the earth we know) it could end this dire emergency. It could also work if enough white or asian males were aborted too. I suspect that one is more likely to occur. Haven&rsquo;t black women suffered enough? Well, a lot but not Too much. </p>

<p>Good Riddance:</p>
<p>Excellent point! Letting the representatives of the blacks openly speak their mind makes even a few strident libs say &#8220;wait a minute&#8221;. Imagine the media firestorm if the same was said to liberal bloggers by one of the many phony conservatives in the house who call themselves republicans, yet everybody can tell the Tea party (whites standing up for white self-interest) to stick it with zero repercussions. </p>

		<p>Always keep in mind that Blacks are not that smart, nor that well educated, so a lot of what they say is full of internal inconsistencies, don&rsquo;t expect it to make a lot of sense. </p>

		<p>She&rsquo;s still wearing that wig the male comics who did the  1920&rsquo;s burlesque house entre&rsquo;acte dirty jokes act wore. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of attractive natural looking wigs in the affordable $200 to $500 dollar range.  Surely her salary could stretch to 2 or 3 decent looking wigs?</p>
<p>Or is she boycotting asian and White owned businesses. They seem to own all the wig shops.</p>
<p> &ldquo;buy African American.&rdquo; Has anyone seen the new Hyundia car ad?<br>
Montages of assembly line scenes &#8221; Made in America, by Americans for Americans&#8221; 4 or 5 workers say the lines.  All are black.  Not 1 White face is in the ad.</p>
<p>No Hyundias for me, just as no Chryslers or all state insurance.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t avoid the trial on nightly news here in Los Angeles.  I&rsquo;ve just seen a few bits and pieces.  The bodyguards have been testifying that Dr. Murray didn&rsquo;t know how to do CPR. Also did not have it together enough to call 911.  Murray actually asked the 12 year old child and the bodygard to do CPR.</p>
<p>The bodyguard who was asked to do CPR was called by Dr. Murray at home to drive 20 miles to do the CPR.<br>

		<p>&#8221; It is against cosmic law to live off someone else&rsquo;s labor. &#8220;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about that.  The Manchu bannermen managed to live off the labor of the Han and other Chinese peoples for 400 years.</p>
<p>When Sun Yat Sen overthrew the Manchu goverment in 1911 there were millions of Manchu families that had been living off their Manchu goverment pensions for 200 and more years.</p>
<p>Bet those great experts on Chinese history and  culture Englemann and Rushton don&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>The White hispanics of S. America have lived off the labor of the indian hispanics for 500 years now.</p>

		<p>Sheila Jackson-Lee is perfectly qualified to lead her constituents. She is the best and brightest they have to offer.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to love?  Ms. Jackson-Lee is always gracious, soft-spoken, considerate and loved by one and all, especially her staff  (isn&rsquo;t she??).  </p>
<p>Why, she regularly hands out endearing nicknames to the people who work for her. The Houston Democrat addresses her employees as &ldquo;you stupid m.f.s&#8221;</p>
<p>According to one staffer, SJL would always say:  &lsquo;What am I a prostitute? Am I your prostitute? You can&rsquo;t prostitute me&hellip;I am a queen, and I demand to be treated like a queen!!&#8221; </p>
<p>Her former drivers say the congresswoman demanded they run red lights and drive on highway shoulders around traffic. When getting into the car in the morning, she gave her aide directions to the Rayburn building one block away, even if the aide had been driving her there every morning for months or years.</p>
<p>One of SJL&rsquo;s drivers said: &ldquo;She was making me wait in the car, sometimes upwards of five to seven hours per day.&#8221; She sometimes demands two staffers in two cars pick her up from the airport, one for her, the other for her luggage.</p>
<p>* At JPL, Lee asked a guide whether the Mars Pathfinder had taken a photograph of the flag planted on Mars by Neil Armstrong in 1969. it was pointed out that the flag in question was on the moon, not Mars, Jackson Lee cited bigotry. &ldquo;You thought you could have fun with a black woman member of the Science Committee,&rdquo; </p>
<p>* In July 2010, Lee stated, from the floor of the House of Representatives, that North and South Vietnam had managed to forge a peaceful relationship with one another in the years since the Vietnam War&hellip;.&#8221;Today we have two Vietnams, side by side, North and South, exchanging and working together!&#8221;</p>
<p>* About the tea party:  &#8220;All those who wore sheets a long time ago have now lifted them off and started wearing, uh, clothing, uh, with a name, say, I am part of the Tea Party. Don&rsquo;t you be fooled.&#8221;</p>
<p>* And:  &#8220;The Fifth Amendment speaks specifically to denying someone their life and liberty without due process. That is what H.R. 2 does and I rise in opposition to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the Best and Brightest!!  Racism?  Yes, that too:</p>

		<p>This atrocious loudmouth, a monumentally stupid woman, was raised and educated in Brooklyn. She has no logical connection to Texas at all.  </p>
<p>I suspect she doesn&rsquo;t have a connection to black Americans either.  I strongly suspect she&rsquo;s of West Indian birth, or at least of West Indian parentage.  Does anyone have any information on this?</p>
