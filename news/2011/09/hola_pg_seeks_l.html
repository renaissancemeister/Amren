<h1>Hola: P&G; Seeks Latino Shoppers</h1>

	<p>Expect more Spanish on your tube of Crest toothpaste.</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., looking for ways to boost its sluggish U.S. business, is accelerating its efforts to win over Hispanic shoppers. Using insights turned out by its army of researchers, P&G; is tweaking products, retargeting its marketing, changing its mix of celebrity spokeswomen and making greater use of Spanish on its products.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Sales in the U.S. Hispanic population, however, are showing better growth. In the past decade, the demographic&rsquo;s spending on laundry, household-cleaning supplies and personal-care products grew nearly three times faster than non-Hispanics&rsquo; outlays, according to market-research firm Packaged Facts.</p>
<p>Hispanic households tend to spend more on cleaning and beauty products and are more loyal to the brands they like than the average U.S. consumer, industry analysts say. P&G;&rsquo;s researchers have found that while generally frugal spenders, Hispanics are also willing to splurge on the types of premium household goods that P&G; makes, subscribing to the phrase &#8220;lo barato sale caro,&#8221; meaning that cheap things may ultimately prove costly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>P&G; has increasingly targeted Hispanic shoppers in recent years, designing products and marketing to appeal to the demographic. The company has found Hispanic consumers are more likely to be fans of using fragrances in their homes. To capture that preference, P&G; has rolled out products including Febreze&rsquo;s &#8220;Destinations Collection&#8221; of air fresheners featuring scents like Brazilian Carnaval and Hawaiian Aloha. Likewise, its new Gain dish soap features fragrances like &#8220;Apple Mango Tango.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, P&G;&rsquo;s Pantene shampoo and Gillette Venus razors now include actress Eva Mendes as well as singer and actress Jennifer Lopez, respectively, as spokeswomen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also on the agenda is greater use of Spanish on P&G; products and coupons. Such moves rankled some shareholders who complained at the company&rsquo;s annual meeting last October that most Americans spoke English.</p>

		<p>P&G; should have been with me Tuesday at the Wal-Mart in Martinsburg WV, there were a host of their targeted audience in the deodorant section, opening package after package, sniffing each one, and if they found one they liked, applying a bit to themselves.</p>
<p>I suggest P&G; create a new brand just for this market and call it &ldquo;Libre&rdquo;, and make it easy to open and easy to pocket, because in my marketing field research, their newly targeted market is only open to that kind of product.<br>

		<p>I long for the days when all products in America have only English language labels on them. If a country has more than 1 official language, and has those languages on their packaging, I can understand. But there&rsquo;s so much Spanish on the packaging these days you&rsquo;d think you were buying a product imported from Mexico or any other Spanish speaking country. </p>

		<p>My friend and I were at a Target store where the majority of customers were hispanic. Lots of packaging was ripped open. Everywhere you looked parts of items were missing or broken.  In the deodorant isle a woman perused the offerings while her son of about 12 squatted next to her and sprayed deodorant into can lids and huffed it, all slack mouthed and glassy eyed. She was totally unconcerned. This is our future, no wait, our present.</p>

		<p>Not surprising,virtually all the latino households that I&rsquo;ve been in have been spotless(even the old trailers).<br>
When I had to go to court this year in a county about 50 miles west of Atlanta I noticed that the only defendant besides myself dressed up was a hispanic man.The rest had on old jeans and some of the white jurors even had on shorts!!!</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the bad news:  I looked up all the brands that P&G; produces to find out which ones I shouldn&rsquo;t be buying anymore.  The problem is, they make so much that if I swore them all off, I&rsquo;d practically be homeless, hungry, wearing smelly clothes and having rotting teeth for the rest of my life.</p>

		<p><i>Expect more Spanish on your tube of Crest toothpaste&hellip;Sales in the U.S. Hispanic population, however, are showing better growth.</i>.</p>
<p>Race and language replacement continue apace all across the country and seem to be accelerating.  Expect Spanish to be ABOVE English on tubes of Crest shortly and other consumer products, as is starting in California, or worse, NO English at all, as I&rsquo;m seeing on billboards and advertisements with increasing frequency.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was in Lowe&rsquo;s, which is sponsoring and promoting a boxing event on TV.  Every advertising banner inside and outside the store, bar none, was entirely in Spanish without a single word of English.</p>
<p>This is coming your way if you live outside of the Southwest as truck drivers who post on AmRen report seeing mexicans in places like N. Dakota, Maine, Minnesota and other parts far from the Mexican border.  I saw Mexican workers when I traveled through Hawaii and Alaska   &mdash;   they&rsquo;re even in the small towns of Alaska!! </p>

<p>Really?  Come to California and look around   &mdash;     just about anywhere these days.  I can spot a hispanic neighborhood in a heartbeat  &mdash;    dirt lawns, trash, like used diapers in the gutters, paint peeling off the houses, cardboard on broken windows, old rusty cars on blocks, ripped up sidewalks, graffiti on trees stumps and lampposts, loud mexican music blasting from cars and homes.  These are neighborhoods that used to be quiet, safe, spotless and neat when the homes were occupied by Whites.</p>

<p> Victor David Hanson&rsquo;s <i>Two Californias</i> about how mexicans have &#8220;transformed&#8221; (I&rsquo;d say ruined) California&rsquo;s Central Valley, where my grandparents were from.  I&rsquo;m glad they&rsquo;re not here to see what has happened to their old farming town and neighborhood   &mdash;   it was enough to make even ME cry.  I&rsquo;ll never go back.</p>
<p><i>Many of the rural trailer-house compounds I saw appear to the naked eye no different from what I have seen in the Third World. There is a Caribbean look to the junked cars, electric wires crisscrossing between various outbuildings, plastic tarps substituting for replacement shingles, lean-tos cobbled together as auxiliary housing, pit bulls unleashed, and geese, goats, and chickens roaming around the yards.</i></p>

		<p>I won&rsquo;t be buying p&g; products anymore, and I was a usually loyal customer of pantene and crest. Not only this but the fact that chinese ripoffs have been found in stores, has convinced me of the value of home crafting. I knit instead of buying clothes made in china. I will start researching how to make healthy toothpaste (lead-free, unlike chinese-made crest) and there are plenty of Folks that make their own soap. All media and industry are against us! Boycott all!<br>
Do not go see movies, do something fun and productive instead. TV and movies are huge wastes of time. Make your own cartoons if you want, old fashioned page-flip cartoon books are better than anything on tv.<br>
Create what you want to see! Think of Dennis the Menace.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been going for natural stuff more and more myself.  The fewer chemicals you use on yourself and your house, the better.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found that baking soda works great on the hair.  Plus it&rsquo;s cheaper!</p>

		<p>What this really all boils down to is that P&G; (like any other business entity) wants to increase its business, sales and profits by expanding its customer base. Any salesperson, business executive or marketing personell member of any company or corporation simply wants to increase sales and wants to prosper and thrive  &mdash;  regardless of what industry he or she is in. If P&G; is agressively targeting the Hispanic/Latino market, it&rsquo;s simply because the corporation has realized that there is money to be made by reaching out to that community. It&rsquo;s not a matter of racism, racial preferences or favoritism toward any particular ethnic group but rather about increasing the corporation&rsquo;s sales and profits.</p>
