<h1><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0921/Zimbabwe-a-new-wave-of-land-seizures">Zimbabwe: A New Wave of Land Seizures?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Science Monitor, September 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A country still reeling under the economic meltdown of the controversial land reform, Zimbabwe is on the brink of yet another potentially damaging economic exercise: seizing white-controlled companies in urban centers and mines throughout the country.</p>
<p>Under the banner of the 21st February Movement, an organization formed in line with President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s birthday, Zanu PF youths are indiscriminately invading white- and foreign-owned companies under the controversial Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act, which requires that foreigners possess 41 percent of shares while the rest goes to indigenous people.</p>
<p>While compliance should be executed in boardrooms, young members of the Zimbabwe African National Union  &mdash;  Patriotic Front, led by President Mugabe, have adopted the violent land reform style of grabbing the companies, at times forcing the closure of strategic economic units and at the same time causing mayhem, especially in the capital, Harare. It&rsquo;s a method that was used in the past decade against white-owned farms, and which has been blamed for a severe drop in food production. Once a food-exporter, Zimbabwe now is a recipient of food aid.</p>
<p>Press reports in Zimbabwe suggests that the &#8220;rogue&#8221; youths have &#8220;literally taken over Harare by invading almost all council properties, car parks, ranks, markets and open spaces meant for council projects,&#8221; saying they were taking over what &#8220;rightly belonged&#8221; to them.</p>
<p>Home Affairs co-minister Mrs. Theresa Makone has said she had given up on trying to control the youths.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe&rsquo;s second-largest city, Bulawayo, the same youths have occupied buildings owned by Zimbabweans of Asian origin for the past year, claiming it was part of their indigenization drive to pass businesses onto black people. Prejudice against Africans of Asian origin is common throughout the continent because of their prominent place in business affairs. African politicians of the past, such as Uganda&rsquo;s former dictator Idi Amin, once targeted Asian merchants and landowners.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Political commentator Hopewell Gumbo says that the current wave of invasions could finish off those few sections of the economy that still function.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is another exercise which spells doom for Zimbabwe, particularly on the economic front,&#8221; says Mr. Gumbo. &#8220;The unfortunate reality is that while in the Government of National Unity, the MDC is trying to heal the battered economy, Zanu PF is pulling in another direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new wave of invasions will not benefit the country at all except to put the country on the rogue map of the world,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Zanu PF is grandstanding.&#8221;</p>

		<p> The Future; Zimbabwe people are starving, the situation is desperate, men women and children are dying in horrendous numbers. History will be rewritten to lay the blame at the feet of the white race, all atrocities by blacks against whites will be covered up and then the guilty whites will be forced to atone for the sins of their ancestors. A few very old white people will attempt to tell the truth and will be shouted down and branded liars. All evidence of the truth will be destroyed.<br>
 All in the name of &#8220;Political Correctness&#8221;.</p>

		<p>One can only hope that they will complete their own self-destruction so that whites can re-establish a functioning nation there.  In the mean time, whites must stand well back so that Zimbabweans can return the land to the way it was when whites first arrived, virtually devoid of ANY human presence.  Same goes for SA.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if someone paid attention to events in Zim and SA?  From bread basket to basket case. I think the blacks hate whites more than they love life. Maybe China will come in and roll over them like a steam roller, take the resources, and sell them AKs so ZANU PF can &#8220;keep it real&#8221; while tribes take to killing one another; and who are we in the US and Europe to tell the Chinese what to do? </p>

		<p>The British imported the Asians as a cheap workforce, because the local blacks were too lazy to work. This pattern occurred all over the continent. Hardworking Asians eventually astablished small businesses and enterprises all over the East Africa, until dictators like Amin and Mugabe started expelling them. The economy of Uganda during Amin&rsquo;s rule collapsed because of expelling whites and Asians, and the same scenario repeated in Zimbabwe. Blacks left to themselves will inevitably fail to create any kind of stable society. This is probably caused by their very low average IQ (70)</p>

		<p>No 2.  I agree remembering that when Dr Jamieson and his group first visited the country from South Africa in 1880, there were only 400 000 natives living there.  In 1970, still Rhodesia but under international sanctions the population had grown to 11 million many of whom moved to the country, blacks from surrounding countries, then called Rhodesia and it was rich and secure except for the terrorists such as Mugabe.  All ate well and most had jobs.</p>
<p>No aid for Zimbabwe in the future.  They have what they wanted so they must live/die with it.</p>

		<p>Its a classic case of &#8220;I told you so&#8221; in my opinion. Anyone who witnessed events in other African countries that went through a similar experience could have put 2 and 2 together to understand the outcome in Zimbabwe. The problem is they are the West&rsquo;s problem for us to send aid and food. What to do?</p>

		<p>China already owns Zimbabwe. They are raping it for its minerals and keeping the current govt. in power in order to facilitate that rape. (They bring in Chinese workers to do anything more important than cleaning the toilets).</p>

<p>This is interesting.  I have heard/read about Chinese presence in many places in Africa, notably in the east and south.  It will be interesting to see how they deal with the coming riots and &#8220;flash mob&#8221; takeovers of their facilities and now corporate offices.  They may succeed in getting away with killing off the surplus black populations since no one in the world will be able to stop them from doing it.  I find this idea ironic because China is already supporting Sudanese mass murder, and there is little discussion of it.  The Chinese era of capitalist imperialism will serve to make the American era of capitalist imperialism a fond memory, and the era of European colonialism the &#8220;golden age&#8221; of Africa.</p>

		<p>And do you just for one moment think that my compatriots have just a slight little feeling of unease looking northward?</p>
<p>No, it is business as usual. Rugby and barbeque for the weekend. Church on Sunday. Like one writer wrote on Dr. Dan Roodt&rsquo;s website PRAAG - they are &#8216;unmobilisable&rsquo;. One can tear out ones hair out of disbelieve and frustration. They are lulling themselves into a sense of normalcy, a sort of a Walter Mitty world.</p>
<p>If one turns on the radio - it is rugby or cricket blahblahdeblah. One website said we are not doing too bad, only 5% unemployment amongst the whites (from the department of Statistics). At work we have targets to meet and that encompasses our whole life, politics, that&rsquo;s not our problem, let others more competent stress about this.<br>

		<p>Sadly, blacks can only destroy that which has been created by other races.  They have no history of creation, invention, origination, or advanced cultural achievement.</p>
<p>They are a uniquely (and tragically) inferior race in terms of intellect, emotional control, and discipline.  It&rsquo;s no accident that throughout the history of the African continent, over eons, they never advanced beyond tribal savagery.</p>

		<p>The Chinese can come into Africa and be as brutal as they please because they&rsquo;re not white.  Western liberals will thus not criticize them, and what can anyone in the world do about it anyway?<br>
In the film &#8220;Mugabe and the White African&#8221;, about an old white man whose farm is threatened with seizure, a usurping black triumphantly tells him that the blacks are now dealing with &#8220;Asians&#8221; instead of whites.  And, of course, he means recently arrived Chinese, not long-established Indians and other Asians.  These new Chinese pay lower wages than whites and treat the locals abominably, but all low-IQ &#8220;reformers&#8221; know is that they&rsquo;re not white.</p>

		<p>Blacks take what whites make and run it into the ground everywhere, every place.  We hear about how we&rsquo;re all the same and, at the same time, blacks are the strong race and not whites.  Again, I&rsquo;m waiting for someone to prove how black supremacy is a better alternative than white supremacy.  I&rsquo;m waiting for someone to prove we&rsquo;re all the same.  I&rsquo;m waiting for someone to show any other race that has done more to uplift and help blacks than whites have.  Give me proof.</p>

		<p>Here is an opportunity for Prime Minister Cameron of the UK</p>
<p>In a recent speech - responding to voter demands, and no doubt to save his job - he stated that his government will end &#8220;mass&#8221; immigration and focus on &#8220;good&#8221; immigration.</p>
<p>Most of the whites and Asians (Indians - not Chinese orientals) in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) were encouraged to settle there when the territory was a British Colony. The intent was to develop wealth for the mother country - Great Britain.</p>
<p>They were loyal subjects to the crown and supplied manpower in both WWI and WWII. Ian Smith flew Spitfires in the battle of Britain. Rhodesia was also used a safe refuge in which to train pilots for the RAF during WWII. In 1923 they voted against becoming another province of South Africa and stayed loyal to Britain</p>
<p>For their loyalty Britain abandoned them to black majority rule in 1980.</p>
<p>So Mr Cameron, how about providing a haven for your kith and kin now that the black majority are robbing them of their livelihoods? </p>
<p>They will be &#8220;good&#8221; immigrants I can assure.<br>
In no time they will be employed and paying taxes and not be a burden to the state like the rest of the unproductive third worlders you freely welcome into the UK.</p>

		<p>HELL! when ISN&rsquo;T the Zim/Somali/Ethiopia starving and then the U.S. sends lots of money and food so that we shortly after, have tens of thousands more starving blacks. It is simply the feeding the cats at the back door, more food, more kittens etc etc requiring more and more and more food aid until finally you have to tell your wife NO MORE!! Hympthetically of course:)</p>
