<h1>New Studies Show Severe Racial Discrimination at University of Wisconsin</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Center for Equal Opportunity, September 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two studies released today by the Center for Equal Opportunity reveal severe discrimination based on race and ethnicity in undergraduate and law school admissions at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with African Americans and Latinos given preference over whites and Asians.</p>
<p>The studies are based on data supplied by the schools themselves, some of which the university had refused to turn over until a lawsuit was filed by CEO and successfully taken all the way to the state supreme court. The studies were prepared by Dr. Althea Nagai, a research fellow at CEO, and can be viewed on the organization&rsquo;s website, www.ceousa.org. </p>
<p>CEO president Roger Clegg will answer questions about the studies when they are formally released at a press conference today at 11:00 a.m. at the DoubleTree hotel in Madison  &mdash;  525 W. Johnson St.</p>
<p>The odds ratio favoring African Americans and Hispanics over whites was 576-to-1 and 504-to-1, respectively, using the SAT and class rank while controlling for other factors. Thus, the median composite SAT score for black admittees was 150 points lower than for whites and Asians, and the Latino median SAT score was 100 points lower. Using the ACT, the odds ratios climbed to 1330-to-1 and 1494-to-1, respectively, for African Americans and Hispanics over whites. </p>
<p>For law school admissions, the racial discrimination found was also severe, with the weight given to ethnicity much greater than given to, for example, Wisconsin residency. Thus, an out-of-state black applicant with grades and LSAT scores at the median for that group would have had a 7 out 10 chance of admission and an out-of-state Hispanic a 1 out of 3 chance  &mdash;  but an in-state Asian with those grades and scores had a 1 out of 6 chance and an in-state white only a 1 out of 10 chance.</p>
<p>CEO chairman Linda Chavez noted: &#8220;This is the most severe undergraduate admissions discrimination that CEO has ever found in the dozens of studies it has published over the last 15 years.&#8221; Chavez also noted: &#8220;The studies show that literally hundreds of students applying as undergrads or to the law school are rejected in favor of students with lower test scores and grades, and the reason is that they have the wrong skin color or their parents came from the wrong countries.&#8221; </p>
<p>Roger Clegg added: &#8220;The latest census figures have dramatically underscored that America is increasingly multiethnic and multiracial. In such country, is simply untenable for our institutions  &mdash;  including public universities  &mdash;  to engage in politically correct but divisive and unfair discrimination.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity recently joined an amicus brief challenging the use of racial preferences at the University of Texas, in a case for which review by the U.S. Supreme Court will be sought this week.</p>

						<p><small><em>WHBL 1330 (Madison), September 13, 2011</em></small></p>
<p><br>
Over 100 protestors interrupted a news conference in Madison Monday. </p>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity held the briefing to explain its data showing that UW Madison admits larger percentages of blacks and Hispanics  &mdash;  and they average lower test scores and class ranks than whites. </p>
<p>Center president Roger Clegg was about 45 minutes into his presentation at a hotel near the Madison campus, when at least one protestor found a back door and busted in. </p>
<p>Until then, the group was kept outside. A hotel worker tackled the first protestor, but others managed to get in. Once inside, the racially-mixed group chanted &#8220;Power to the People&#8221; and &#8220;We&rsquo;re more than our scores.&#8221; At that point, Clegg ended his talk and left. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The hotel&rsquo;s manager later said protestors had tossed some of his workers to the ground during their entry. </p>

<p>Sounds like the race-replacement enthusiasts have given up on that good old meritocracy argument. Their next step will be to identify a new generation of &lsquo;haters&rsquo; called &lsquo;able-ists&rsquo;, or something similar. Madison talked about the unequal distribution of ability in humanity and the problems it creates in Federalist 10:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to a uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madison argued that national talent should be protected by government. Our current group of self-esteem specialists argues that national talent should be targeted and suppressed by government. This is a logical progression for a system of government with an electorate that has slowly expanded from economically-engaged free men to the extremist democracy we have today. And it is suicidal in the short run.</p>

		<p>According to Vdare, Blacks in Wisconsin are much more likely than the general population to be on TANF (the successor to AFDC) compared with other states. So the state that loves to pander and kowtow to blacks also was home to that awful flash mob not too long ago at their state fair. This proves that if you give them an inch, they&rsquo;ll quickly take a mile. </p>

		<p>So what else is new?  </p>
<p>At least the University gives applications to Whites, unlike goverment agencies and engineering and IT firms that won&rsquo;t even pass out job applications to Whites.</p>
<p>This has been enshrined in both judcial and administrative (EEOC) law since 1968.</p>
<p>Maybe a nice inspiring speech by the National Policy Institute will change the odds from 576 to 1 to 575 to 1.</p>

		<p>As always, our foes struck the first blows. Worse, there seems to be no evidence they were met with a like response. Just once I would like to read that white attendees of such a conference fought back when assaulted by multi-cultist protestors. </p>
<p>I know the msm would go bananas over that, but I suspect most whites would be delighted by the news, even if quietly. Having read the comments offered lately to pc tilted stories, I believe an audience exists for a level take on issues of race and ethnicity.</p>

		<p>Notice how the liberal university sought to prevent exposure of its discriminatory policies until the state supreme court ordered it to do so.  The liberals lie about equal opportunity, hide their favoritism to pet groups behind closed doors, and when finally exposed, they invade a hotel to prevent people hearing of their lies.  Such is what the Left calls transparency!  &mdash;    &mdash;  Hugh Murray</p>

		<p> It strikes me as funny as we defeat more and more of these discrimination set asides that we may very well end up marching in Selma. The new black police chief will be using his bullhorn telling us to disperse. Then some black and latino guys will blow up a white church but eventually we win. History seems to repeat itself.</p>

		<p>Oh please; as Lyndon Johnson said: &#8220;we must have equality of results&#8221;. This is what equality looks like. It is &#8220;diversity&#8221; formerly known as quotas. The one part that bears looking at in certain professions is exams like bar exams and the like. So far, to my knowledge, these are still barriers to complete incompetents getting credentialed. That said, this thuggish response to the report is so typical of the political correctness which is strangling education in this country.</p>

		<p>Still a useful text today. He documented the gross disparities in admissions&rsquo; standards then, but as the new article says, nothing has been as bad as what is now documented about the UW.</p>
<p>The book also has fine discussions of the other pernicious effects of &#8216;Affirmative Action&rsquo; on campuses.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Stick it to the white male&#8221; is shorthand way of understanding the how the diversity ideology translates into admissions policies at elite universities, particularly if said white males are of lower socioeconomic status. Although the stats below are not as dramatic as at U. of Wisconsin, they are a compelling glimpse at the inner workings of America&rsquo;s top universities: </p>
<p>&#8220;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;SoCal LoCal&#8221; is correct. Anyone publically defending Whites against naked discrimination, especially on a college campus, needs to anticipate disruption and violence, and be prepared to defend themsleves and their meeting. We look weak and helpless being constantly shouted-down and attacked thus - it has to stop. Whether it mean hiring private security(preferably armed security)or simply placing volunteers in positions of security, these Leftist and non-white agitators need to learn that THEY do not control this discussion - and they sure as Hell don&rsquo;t control White men!!</p>

		<p>&#8220;Power to the people&#8221;? &#8220;We are more than our scores&#8221;?</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to my mind is brain surgery. Is Mr. &#8220;I&rsquo;m more than my college test scores&#8221; going to work on my brain or yours? Do you want to be an astronaut being guided through space by a ground-control &#8220;engineer&#8221; who earned his degree because, well, he was brown? </p>
<p>Level the playing fields. Abandon the handicaps of AA and PC. Competition is good. It makes everyone stronger. </p>
<p>I pray the Tea Partyers cause a Whirlwind of a Revolution in this country. Cut, cut, cut every sickening drain on our governing bodies. As a White American who really does not wish anyone ill, I would, however, like to see institutions like NPR, PBS, the Dept of Education, the Dept of Labor, the thirty-something presidential czars, and all of the endless state-funded idiotic AA programs of every kind (especially in education) chucked into a heavy-duty garbage disposal. </p>
<p>I hear Thoreau calling for us to &#8220;simplify,&#8221; and I hear Emerson pleading for &#8220;self-reliance.&#8221; What happened to THAT breed of American?</p>

		<p>It is my understanding that Barry Soetero attended Occidental College in California about thirty years ago. He was afforded foreign aid as he was an Indonesian citizen.</p>
<p>I understand that Soetero partied a lot in college, then dropped out, and went to Pakistan. Later, he  &mdash;  a college dropout  &mdash;  got into Columbia, then Harvard, but this time, he attended as Barack Obama. </p>
<p>I went to college during the same years, also in California, and I paid for every penny of tuition, every cent for every book, and even all my parking permits. I worked all night long in a noisy factory to pay my own way through college because I was raise to do things like pay my own way. I often applied for financial aid, but, of course, was denied because of race. At the same time, Soetero was gaming the system, working politically correct America, and he never stopped working/gaming the warped political establishment. </p>
<p>Our nation has become perverse. Our president is a fraud. Nobody has the integrity or guts to fully take on his illegitimacy. Many reputable voices on the internet suggest that the Saudis gave millions to Harvard; then Obama became president and, as president, bowed before the Saudi king. </p>
<p>The WASP American has been a victim of his own graciousness and generosity and philanthropy. Our educational institutions have been usurped just as the White House has. All we have to do is say one word: Enough.</p>

		<p>Those of us in Wisconsin are not exactly surprised by this, pumping the not quite literate and not quite ready blacks through the UW is big biz. It results in some very amusing graduates who are not quite yet &#8220;ready.&#8221;<br>
Anti white discrimination is a popular game here, being white while trying to get an education in the UW system is hazardous to your health. The sychopants known as profs. are more than willing to grind whitey into the dirt under their filthy communist boots.</p>

If peaceful whites attending a conference  were attacked in such a scenario, and they attempted to defend themselves,  it would be described by the media as a &#8220;fight&#8221;.. as if both parties were equally culpable.</p>

		<p>Yes I noticed they minimized the &#8220;w&#8221; in the word White. But who cares? I always capitalize White and refer to sub-Saharans as black. NEVER AA. Hispanics should be in caps. We should be European-Americans or Caucasian, which is the correct response. For this particular article it&rsquo;s obvious that they are trying to pick a fight with Whites. Fight &#8216;em back by minimizing them. They are marxists and egalitarians, not my kind of White. We are more than our scores. Yeah, and I am more than &#8220;White boy.&#8221; A lot damn more. </p>

<p>As the immensely popular blog, &#8220;Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like&rsquo; has been making clear for over a year now, the total WRONGNESS of the INEQUITY of this sort of &#8216;shell game&rsquo; has caused BRA (Black-Run America) to literally destroy itself, as the contual calls for &#8216;more and more&rsquo; (including reparations for slavery, victim status, and a corresponding, &#8216;no one DARES to criticize me&rsquo; attitude) lead Whites to awaken that this entire thing has the ring of the shyster about it. </p>
<p>One can only ask, &#8216;Where is this ideology of &#8216;victimhood&rsquo; coming from?&rsquo; Who taught blacks, hispanics, and other non-Europeans&rsquo; this stuff? Once one begins to note &#8216;cui bono?&rsquo; [Who benefits] from all this, will Americans finally know the puppetmasters behind it all, up to and including the recent occupant of the White House.</p>
<p>The anger is building and building and building. Clearly, Whites are finally at a tipping point. Why, even the term &#8216;racist&rsquo; is not as fear-mongering as it was a mere five years ago. Which can only mean good things for the Real Americans- the Whites of this land-  the &#8216;posterity&rsquo; of &#8216;for US and our posterity- who have been bled dry.</p>

		<p>Let us be honest. If we whites DON&rsquo;T lower the standards for Blacks and Mexican, then they will not be able to attend college.</p>
<p>We have to either dumb down the classes for them OR give them special treatment. If we don&rsquo;t, the colleges will end up all Asian, White and Jewish.</p>
<p>We all know this. The Blacks know this. The liberals know this. Blacks and Mexicans are just plain dumber than us. WE ALL KNOW THIS and that is why all this is going on. Let us ALL stop hiding it, come out and admit they are dumb and let them in under more childlike rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Blacks know they are dumber than whites. That is why they want to live around us and have us take care of them. Have you ever known a Black who prefers to live around Blacks? NO WAY. They demand to live around us whites since they admit we whites are better at civilization.</p>

		<p>Please, say good-bye to the University of Wisconsin. When Whites start leaving these Marxist indoctrination factories for Schools like Patrick Henry College, they will become as enriched as Inner-City &#8220;Charter&#8221; Schools like Jackie Robinson Charter School, and the School For Scholarship and Social Justice, and other such mindless nonsense. </p>
<p>Then we can read about the constant shoot-outs that the Crips and Bloods have on these Campuses. Who cares? The Liberal Do-gooders, and the Marxist morons will then have to run the gauntlet of their oppressed types to and from the &#8220;Classes&#8221; they will be &#8220;Teaching&#8221;. </p>

		<p>Please do not judge my beloved state by the psychopathic antics of whacko liberal Madison or ultra ghetto Milwaukee.  The sons of the people who TRULY made this state great are hard working, level headed, blue-collar people who are fed up with PC politics and the liberal destruction of this country.  Wisconsin is not a liberal utopia.  It only appears that way because of the only two cities that ever make the news, Madison and Milwaukee.  The greater Metro area of Milwaukee and all of its hell is a WORLD away from TRUE Wisconsinites up hear in the northwoods.  Modern Milwaukee is nothing more than a suburb of ChiCongo.  Illinois could annex it tomorrow and I&rsquo;d say good riddance. </p>

AmRen should hire a law firm to run an advertisement warning Whites that they have been discriminated against and have cause for suit and monetary damages.  </p>
<p>Same for UGA. It&rsquo;s new Diversity and Inclusion policy is blatantly &#8220;White Men Not Wanted&#8221;.  Why hasn&rsquo;t AmRen been all over this by encouraging White men who apply for jobs at UGA to sue if they aren&rsquo;t hired?   The policy itself relegates them to second class citizenship.  They could sue and win.</p>
<p>AmRen still has far to go. Direct action is the next step.  Plenty of White pro bono civil rights lawyers out there who would take on cases like these for the $$$ checks to come.</p>

		<p>Here is something the Director of CEO wrote about the attack on the CEO by the White hating racists.</p>
<p>The campus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison erupted this week after the release of two studies documenting the heavy use of race in deciding which students to admit to the undergraduate and law schools. The evidence of discrimination is undeniable, and the reaction by critics was undeniably dishonest and thuggish.? </p>
<p>The Center for Equal Opportunity (CEO), which I founded in 1995 to expose and challenge misguided race-based public policies, conducted the studies based on an analysis of the university&rsquo;s own admissions data. But the university was none too keen on releasing the data, which CEO obtained through filing Freedom of Information Act requests only after a successful legal challenge went all the way to the state supreme court.? </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder the university wanted to keep the information secret. The studies show that a black or Hispanic undergraduate applicant was more than 500 times likelier to be admitted to Wisconsin-Madison than a similarly qualified white or Asian applicant. The odds ratio favoring black law school applicants over similarly qualified white applicants was 61 to 1.? </p>
<p>The median SAT scores of black undergraduates who were admitted were 150 points lower than whites or Asians, while the median Hispanic scores were roughly 100 points lower. And median high school rankings for both blacks and Hispanics were also lower than for either whites or Asians.? </p>
<p>CEO has published studies of racial double standards in admissions at scores of public colleges and universities across the country with similar findings, but none has caused such a violent reaction.? </p>
<p>Instead of addressing the findings of the study, the university&rsquo;s vice provost for diversity, Damon A. Williams, dishonestly told students that &#8220;CEO has one mission and one mission only: dismantle the gains that were achieved by the civil rights movement.&#8221; In fact, CEO&rsquo;s only mission is to promote color-blind equal opportunity so that, in Martin Luther King&rsquo;s vision, no one will be judged by the color of his or her skin.? </p>
<p>Egged on by inflammatory comments by university officials, student groups organized a flashmob via a Facebook page that was filled with propaganda and outright lies about CEO wanting to dismantle their student groups. More than a hundred angry students stormed the press conference at the Doubletree Hotel in Madison, where CEO president Roger Clegg was releasing the study.? </p>
<p>The hotel management described what took place in a press statement afterward: &#8220;Unfortunately, when escorting meeting attendees out of the hotel through a private entrance, staff were then rushed by a mob of protestors, throwing employees to the ground. The mob became increasingly physically violent when forcing themselves into the meeting room where the press conference had already ended, filling it over fire-code capacity. Madison police arrived on the scene after the protestors had stormed the hotel.&#8221;? </p>
<p>But the outrageous behavior didn&rsquo;t end there   &mdash;   and it wasn&rsquo;t just students but also faculty who engaged in disgraceful conduct. Later the same day of the press conference, Clegg debated UW law professor Larry Church on campus. The crowd booed, hissed, and shouted insults, continuously interrupting Clegg during the debate.? </p>
<p>Having used Facebook to organize the flashmob, students and some faculty extended their use of social media and tweeted the debate live. Even with Twitter&rsquo;s 140-character limit, you&rsquo;d think participants would be able to come up with something more substantive than the repeated use of the label &#8220;racist&#8221; to describe Clegg and his arguments against racial double standards, but hundreds of tweets exhibited little more than hysterical rants and personal attacks.? </p>
<p>Perhaps the most offensive tweet was posted by Sara Goldrick-Rab, an associate professor of educational policy studies and sociology. After announcing that she was &#8220;Getting set to live blog this debate between a racist and a scholar,&#8221; she tweeted that Clegg sounded &#8220;like the whitest white boy I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&#8221; The only racism in evidence came from the defenders of the university&rsquo;s race-based admissions policies, such as Professor Goldrick-Rab.? </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that a responsible university would denounce the intimidation and lack of civility by its students and faculty. Instead, Vice Provost Williams told the student newspaper, &#8220;I&rsquo;m most excited about how well the students represented themselves, the passion with which they engaged, the respectful tone in how they did it and the thoughtfulness of their questions and interactions.&#8221;? </p>
<p>It appears that not only are the university&rsquo;s admissions policies deeply discriminatory, but also that university officials applaud name-calling, distortion and outright physical assault.</p>

		<p>Anonymous 27, my cousin applied to UGA and was, despite a 4.0, a consistently extremely high history of grades back to the first grade, every recommendation known to man, a very clean background and the obvious potential to be a fantastic veterinarian, rejected this past fall.  Why?  Because he is white.  He has the letter and it states that he does not mean the &#8220;racial criteria&#8221; ad nauseum.  The first time I spent any time talking to my cousin (he&rsquo;s a second cousin and lives far away) he was about 12 and kept up with me (I was 37 years old at the time) on every subject from archaeology to politics.  This young man is absolutely brilliant and yet he cannot get into his state&rsquo;s university.  He had to settle for KSU and must change his major or only hope for a transfer.  He is also trying for U of Maryland.  Let&rsquo;s wish him luck!</p>

<p>Please name 1, just 1 White attorney who will file a racial discrimination suit on behalf of a White plaintiff man or woman<br>
even with a substantial retainer of say $15,000.</p>
<p>Pro bono attorneys who will file a race discrimination lawsuit on behalf of a White plaintiff do not exist.</p>
<p>Go ahead, get on findlaw or other attorney search websites and find one, just one. Ask your attorney friends and relatives to file a race discrimination lawsuit with a White plaintiff.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>This is not 1968.  This is 2011, after 45 years of administrative, legislative and judicail precedent rulings have established that no Whites need apply is the law of the land.</p>

Since you seem to be such a legal expert, please name one, just one lawsuit won by a White man alleging racial discrimination in college admissions, employment, or promotion.</p>
<p>I am familiar with most affirmative action lawsuits and rulings.<br>
If you can find any race discrimination lawsuits won by a White, especially a White man, please post them so I can add them to my list of affirmative action lawsuits.<br>

<p>Your narrative is so profound that I can&rsquo;t understate how necessary it is to read it and grok it.  Virtually all of these white leftist hate mobs that &#8220;show up out of nowhere&#8221; to protest conservative or even squishy lame conservative events aren&rsquo;t accidents.  Professors and/or college administrators egg them on.  Young people really aren&rsquo;t that political, and really organize nothing on their own.  </p>
<p>For instance, if you see a bunch of young men in camouflage uniforms and bearing rifles taking control of a hill, you&rsquo;re pretty safe in assuming that there&rsquo;s an old man whose uniform has four or five stars behind it.  Likewise, if a bunch of young people try to shout down a conservative speaker, there&rsquo;s an old person with tenure behind it.</p>

<p>None of them are Academically qualified, yet they are in Colleges, and even make our High Schools living hells. </p>

<p>You are confusing pro bono and contingency.  A contingency attorney carries the cost and gets no retainer.  If he or she wins he or she gets costs including salary and hopefully a share of other damages and settlements.</p>
<p>No attorney will take on a contingency or pro bono affirmative action case for a White who has been discriminated against.  Racial discrimination against Whites is the law of the land as much as traffic and tax laws are.</p>
