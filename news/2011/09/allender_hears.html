			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Montgomery, Rapid City Journal, September 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Members of the North Rapid community greeted Rapid City Police Chief Steve Allender with thanks and concerns about racism at a North Middle School forum Thursday night.</p>
<p>Allender hosted the forum in the aftermath of the Aug. 2 shooting at a North Rapid intersection in which two police officers and the civilian shooter died.</p>
<p>More than 200 people attended the forum, where Allender discussed efforts to fight crime in North Rapid before taking questions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although Allender and the Rapid City Police Department received applause and plaudits during the two-hour forum, there was also plenty of criticism.</p>
<p>Multiple audience members told Allender they see problems with racism against Native Americans from police officers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that there are good cops out there, and there are racist cops,&#8221; Sandra Little said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve seen it. I&rsquo;ve lived here most of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allender defended the department but also asked for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;My preference is that we would never have another shooting, ever, involving a Native American,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Saying it was &#8220;probably very unprofessional to say,&#8221; Allender said that &#8220;as a white police chief, I wish we would only use force against white people, because it would erase that issue that&rsquo;s so hard to deal with and is so troubling for so many people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allender said more than 50 percent of the Rapid City Police Department&rsquo;s arrests are of Native Americans  &mdash;  far larger than the Native share of the population. He noted that a large number of those involved both victims and perpetrators who are Native Americans. &#8220;We have more contact with Native American people than we do non-Native; I can&rsquo;t lie about that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After multiple speakers called on the police department to hire more Native officers, Allender said the police department had tried and failed in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have a great idea for how we can go out and get little Native American boys and girls interested in being law enforcement officers in Rapid City, I&rsquo;m all for it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see this racism stop over here,&#8221; said Cynthia Gonzalez, who identified herself as a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. &#8220;You guys can be more educated in our culture, as well.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I grew up in St. Louis and went to a vastly black majority high school. Man, I was glad when I finished that. In the USMC, I met Merle from Oklahoma who detested Indians, and Josh from So Cal who loathed Mexicans. We had neither of these groups in St. Louis. I guess familiarity breeds contempt. </p>

<p>Probably? Probably? Probably? NO is not not only very unprofessional, but is just plain dumb and stupid and goofy. You cannot say enough bad things about the chief. The man is just plain dumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys can be more educated in our culture, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>They always say that! If you just understood us better, if you just understood our culture better, if you just related to us better, etc. Always. And it means not a whit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have more contact with Native American people than we do non-Native&#8221;</p>
<p>WHO exactly are the non-native? Aren&rsquo;t those whitey also NATIVE to the area. COME from there. NOT different from the American Indian that is NATIVE! Why do they talk that way? Very depressing.</p>
<p>This reminds of the persons against the death penalty saying that only poor, dumb, and persons of color are put to death. That must mean that if only white millionaires with IQ&rsquo;s of 150 or greater were executed it would be OK?</p>

		<p>Sometimes when I read these articles I have to calm myself down because of the unbelievable things that are going on in this country.</p>
<p>If more than 50% of the Rapid City Police Department arrests are of Native Americans, then this is the fault of the Native Americans for committing the crimes in the first place. What do they want? A reward for breaking the law?</p>
<p>Cynthia Gonzalez of the Oglala Sioux Tribe said &ldquo;You guys can be more educated in our culture, as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since when is it the responsibility of the Rapid City police to educate themselves about her Oglala Sioux Tribe? Her tribe needs to &#8220;be more educated&#8221; regarding our laws and the consequences of breaking them.  <br>
 <br>
Police Chief Allender stated &#8220;&hellip;I wish we would only use force against white people, because it would erase that issue that&rsquo;s so hard to deal with and is so troubling for so many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man is a good example of how politically correct our police departments have become. I guess for him it&rsquo;s OK for White people to have their bodies assaulted but it should never happen to a Native American. I guess White people are fair game because he considers us second class citizens.</p>
<p>This is a result of different cultures living in the same environment. We will never have peace.<br>

In 1979 -1982 I lived in Rapid City South Dakota. It was a delightful, safe, small  midnorthern American city with a 200 year old history.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a dangerous &#8220;diverse&#8221; trash hole that is unfit for white people to live in.</p>

This statement is so outrageous I hardly know where to begin. Unprofessional doesn&rsquo;t even begin to sum up this comment pal. You sir are a coward, and why the white folk in this community haven&rsquo;t demanded your head on a platter is beyond me. It&rsquo;s clear that the Native Americans commit most of the crimes in this area, yet he only wishes to use force against WHITE people because that would make he and his department look less &#8220;racist&#8221;? Fire this idiot immediately and get someone in there who won&rsquo;t shrivel instantly when the race card is pulled. I swear I think my blood pressure just shot up 20 points.</p>

		<p>From the article: &#8220;&ldquo;I want to see this racism stop over here,&rdquo; said Cynthia Gonzalez, who identified herself as a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. &ldquo;You guys can be more educated in our culture, as well.&rdquo;&#8221;: And so it goes and it will never end. The whole idea of &#8220;winning&#8221; the West was so that Europeans could implement their own culture over the land and remaining people.  Multicultural doesn&rsquo;t mean all the people living multiple cultures, it means separate groups of people each living their own culture until mass conflict brings about the downfall of the nation.  Otherwise, &#8220;Cynthia&#8221; &#8220;Gonzalez&#8221; is an Oglala Sioux?  I see a troubled future for America.</p>

		<p>I well remember several years ago when visiting this area a group asked a clerk at a store what was the best indian reservation town to visit. They were told not to go on any reservation areas as they may be attacked or even shot at. Area residents told of murder, assaults, domestic violence, theft and property damage by indians. This was the culture not many generations ago and some things don&rsquo;t change.</p>

		<p>Just when I thought I couldn&rsquo;t become any more disgusted.  Maybe Allender can get together with the boneheaded dolt of a woman who was &#8220;begging forgiveness&#8221; on her knees to a black man, presumably for being white but claiming her shame over &#8220;past injustices&#8221; or whatever it was.  I just can&rsquo;t believe the insanity of these folks.  I&rsquo;m really aghast at the groupthink that has seized my fellow whites.  Enough of this now. And thank God for AmRen, a small glimmer of light in this darkness.</p>

		<p>Welcome to 21st Century America:</p>
<p>Since blacks, Latins and Injuns have higher crime rates than whites, all the ACLU and the race-baiting &#8220;community activists&#8221; have to do is produce stats showing that the cops arrest whites less often than other groups and VOILA! - you&rsquo;ve just &#8220;proved&#8221; institutional racism is taking place.</p>

		<p>Mestizos and indians are a fantastically dysfunctional group. They are just complete misfits. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re arrested so much. Don&rsquo;t do the crime, if you don&rsquo;t want to get hassled, you know? No, I guess not.<br>
And this cop. What a worm.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be interested to know how someone with the surname of Gonzales came to be a member of the Oglala Sioux tribe.  It&rsquo;s true that many took English names, but Spanish ones need an explanation, I think.  As for being more educated about their culture, oh, please, come on!  Haven&rsquo;t we been hearing about how great it is forever?  After all, we had that amazingly true non-fiction movie, &#8220;Dances with Wolves&#8221; to teach us about how wonderful they are and how evil the white man is, as well as others, along with squashing the real history of Amerind behaviors in the past.  Looks like not much has changed and it is up to the evil white man to continue to police them.</p>

		<p>having lived in the Dakotas before native <br>
Americans were allowed to buy alcohol I can recall all the news stories of drunk natives killing other native americans.  they were very lethal when drunk.  allowing them to buy alcohol only added fuel to the fires regardless of civil rights.  They expanded their attacks to all races.  Some basic changes have to be made before they can howl racism like not killing people when they are drunk as a start</p>

		<p>&#8220;Allender hosted the forum in the aftermath of the Aug. 2 shooting at a North Rapid intersection in which two police officers and the civilian shooter died.&#8221;</p>
<p>So no-one cares about the two police officers that got killed?<br>
The Chief of Police certainly doesn&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>&#8220;Allender said more than 50 percent of the Rapid City Police Department&rsquo;s arrests are of Native Americans &mdash; far larger than the Native share of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>So which of the following is happening here?<br>
1) The racist police are deliberately arresting Native-Americans for not breaking the law just because they can&hellip;cos they&rsquo;re racist, or<br>
2) Native-Americans tend to be more prone to police attention than other groups in the area and as a result get arrested for it, or<br>
3) The racist police don&rsquo;t arrest people that are not Native-Americans for committing the same misdemeanors that Native-Americans do, once again, due to racism.</p>
<p>I would say that the explanation for why one group of people get arrested more than another for various offenses is due to the fact that they are committing the offenses. The law applies to us all. It does, doesn&rsquo;t it?<br>
Either way, here is Police Chief Steve Allender&rsquo;s solution to the problem:</p>
<p>Allender said that &ldquo;as a white police chief, I wish we would only use force against white people, because it would erase that issue that&rsquo;s so hard to deal with and is so troubling for so many people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yeah, Not only very unprofessional, but also racist, immoral, unethical, and unconstitutional to boot. </p>
<p>So what have we learned? The White Police chief wishes he could only use violence against his fellow white people while avoiding any type of violence against Native Ameircans. </p>
<p>Also, Only whites and white cops are racist. </p>
<p>Whites in North Rapid should avoid the police,or possibly move,  the police chief has violent fantasies about them. He made his wish openly known.</p>

		<p>Many white people need to face a fact.</p>
<p>Cops are a necessary evil in society. However, you should never trust a cop even on something as mundane as a traffic stop. The loyalty of white cops is to the System that signs their paychecks. </p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m sure there are race-conscious white cops out there (how could there not be on that job!), the fact is since we don&rsquo;t know the good ones from the bad ones, you can&rsquo;t really differentiate who&rsquo;s who in the big picture. Cops have to be looked at as a collective group. You can&rsquo;t try and judge cops on an individual basis. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to go: &#8220;This is a good white cop and that&rsquo;s a bad white cop.&#8221; They&rsquo;re all System enforcers just like their non-white counterparts. They have to be viewed with a strong level of suspicion and mistrust by the white citizenry.</p>
<p>A large chunk of the white race has to develop a strong collectivist racial mindset if we&rsquo;re ever gonna successfully pursue our racial interests on an impactful level. We can&rsquo;t trust a government that is becoming more hostile and alien to us with each passing day. And white cops are part of that government system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to carry a small micro-cassette recorder or, if you can, a video camera with you at all times in your car. Just like cops watch us, we need to keep an eye on them as well. Also, don&rsquo;t give the cops an attitude. A lot of cops go out of their way to try and goad innocent people they&rsquo;re dealing with into getting ticked off so they can they can arrest them&hellip;or worse in some cases.</p>
<p>This Police Chief Allender drives home the point loud and clear. His loyalty is clearly to the System that pays him. And he obviously would have no problem violently abusing his fellow whites to make some sort of socio-political point.  </p>
<p>Cop misbehavior against the citizens of this country are splattered all over the Internet. And I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m pushing it when I say the videos on-line are just the tip of the iceberg and there&rsquo;s a lot more criminality perpetrated by many cops that we never know about. </p>

<p>How&rsquo;d you like to be a White cop working for this guy? </p>
<p>The chief just told his White officers that he was going to be unfair and biased against them in any internal affairs investigation where the complainant was a so-called &#8220;Native American.&#8221;  The city now faces liability for wrongful termination. A White citizen who has force used against him by the police department can also sue the department, as well as the city council that leaves the chief in his position (negligent retention).</p>
<p>If I were on the city council I&rsquo;d fire this guy just for being that stupid.</p>

		<p>Many good comments above.   But I am discouraged to see the many posters who unthinkingly use the Politically Correct term,  &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;.   That means they have unwittingly fallen for the new terminology of the Left,  thus  subtly implying that the rest of us &#8220;non-natives&#8221; do not belong here and are  out-of-place  intruders on someone else&rsquo;s land.   Sorry,  iI you were born here, you are a native, period.  Unfortunately, the terminology of the Left has made such inroads that even Amreners are unconscionscly using it! You cannot have success when you are forced into using the terminology of your opponents, with all its psychological overtones of guilt, etc. <br>
 <br>
For me, the American Indians have been called by that name for centuries and it remains a perfectly valid term, nothing pejorative about it,   while &#8220;Native Americans&#8221; is a subtle insult to all the rest of us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll stick with  &#8220;American Indians&#8221;. </p>
<p>(Incidentally, to set the facts straight, the Sioux  were an eastern woodlands tribe who moved out onto the plains about 1800, displacing other Indians in their path.   That Black Hills area was never theirs to begin with. They took it from the Crow Indians, by violent warfare, because of the good hunting grounds.  They only had it for 2 or 3 generations when the whites came along. They were never &#8220;native&#8221; to the area any more than whites were.)</p>

<p>Again, where are the Mass Protests in the streets by Amreners, and othe related groups, to protest this stupidity, and anti-White Racism?</p>
<p>Wake up, people. <br>

They only had it for 2 or 3 generations when the whites came along. They were never &ldquo;native&rdquo; to the area any more than whites were.)&#8221;</p>
<p>From all I have read, this is true.  The Sioux tribes were the pirates of the region, taking slaves, stealing, killing, etc.  This is why the U.S. Cavalry had no lack of Pawnee and other more peaceful Indians as scouts and interpreters, they hated them.  This in fact, was the case throughout the period of American expansion.  There were always tribes that cooperated in order to rid themselves of neighbors who had tormented them for generations.</p>

		<p>This sounds like a more violent version of what I heard about Billings, Montana. The cops roll out on government paydays and pick up Crow Indians on the &#8220;drunk bus&#8221;. Besides being on the watch list of every cop in town, the other thing that I would imagine is that the Indians probably burn up a lot of &#8220;free&#8221; health care services. How well would they survive without the services provided and paid for by whites? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that the women would just love to go back to having children in the same manner as their ancestors 200 years ago. In a dank hut that is about as well insulated as a Dixie cup. Combine that with no epidurals and first pregnancies starting at age 15 (although the age may still be similar). </p>
<p>Maybe the cops should go on the prowl and stop worrying about the &#8220;sensitivities&#8221; of the Ogala Sioux. Respect the laws and you are probably not going to find yourself on the wrong end of a PR-24 or a billy club. </p>

		<p>Did that loser in uniform just say he wish he could beat up just white people to &#8220;prove&#8221; that he wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;racist&#8221; and genuine morally superior gentleman?</p>

		<p>I read a long article a few years ago that explained why many American Indians (Eastern Woodlands types that were moved to middle America) now have Spanish surnames. </p>
<p>It seems that for almost 20 years now, illegal mexican gangbangers have been crossing the border and entering indian reservations to force themselves on the women of the tribe to not only get status, but also to have babies and &#8216;mexicanize&rsquo; the reservations to be used as bases for the cartels to operate from.</p>
<p>The article highlighted how on some reservations, the full blooded indian leaders were alarmed, but silenced by fear, and that mexicans and their gangbanging offspring born on the &#8216;rez, who look like any other indians to a gringo, now run the show.</p>

		<p>The police officer spoke an insane truth and it perfectly expresses the absurdity our law enforcement people deal with everywhere.  The only people they can use force with are White people or they have continuous &#8220;troubling&#8221; issues.  Surreal indeed.  </p>

<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Correct.   The Sioux left the woodlands because of their incessant warfare with their ancient enemies, the Chippawa (Ojibwa), who were getting the better of them.  Together with their allies and relatives, the Cheyenne, they then prodeeded to terrorize the Indians of the plains.  The Kiowa, Crow, etc. hated them. </p>
<p>The Sioux, like some other exclusive tribes we could mention here (but won&rsquo;t),  divided all humanity into two distinct  groups:  Sioux and non-Sioux.  You either were or you wern&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>And now a Sioux named  &#8220;Gonzalez&#8221;  lectures the police that they should be more understanding of Sioux culture!  Some nerve!   When they had the upper hand, were they ever understanding of other&rsquo;s culture?</p>

		<p>Just a few days ago, in getting rid of some old magazines, I read a detailed  account of Red Cloud&rsquo;s War and the Bozeman Trail, including the history of depredations of the Sioux upon other tribes.   This was (I think) in Smithsonian magazine. Unfortunately, the magazine is gone now.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s some useful detail from the  Internet:</p>
<p>            <b>INDIAN WARS BATTLEFIELDS</b></p>
<p><br>
Background:  <br>
The Powder River Country had some of the largest game populations on the northern plains. Since prehistoric times they have been fought over by different Indian tribes. First the area was controlled by the Shoshone. Later,  the Crow Tribe pushed the Shoshone over the mountains and took over the hunting grounds. The Crows were displaced by the seven warlike tribes of the Teton Sioux.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, the United States resumed its westward expansion. Gold was discovered in Montana. John Bozeman laid out a road, the Bozeman Trail, as a shortcut off the Oregon Trail to the goldfields in Montana. The road went through the heart of the Sioux Tribes&rsquo; newly won hunting grounds. The Sioux and their allies, the Northern Cheyenne, reacted violently to this violation of their hunting grounds. The Powder River Country became a battleground for the next twelve years.<br>
 <br>
The Red Cloud War:</p>
<p>From 1866 to 1868 the Sioux and Cheyenne fought to close the Bozeman Trail. The U.S. Army built forts Phil Kearny, F.C. Smith and Reno to guard the trail. Despite the presence of the forts, Red Cloud&rsquo;s Sioux warriors made travel on the Bozeman Trail a life-threatening experience. </p>
<p>The Sioux besieged Fort Phil Kearny, attacking soldiers that left the fort to gather firewood.   On December 21, 1866 a wood party was attacked by Indians. Captain William Fetterman led a force of 80 men out to relieve the wood train. Fetterman led his command into an ambush led by Sioux warrior Crazy Horse. All the soldiers were killed within a few minutes.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Fort Laramie:</p>
<p>Red Cloud continued the pressure on the forts. He refused to make peace until the forts were closed.  In May 1868,  the U.S. Army ordered the forts abandoned. After the soldiers marched out, the Indians burned them to the ground. Finally, in November, 1868 Red Cloud signed a peace treaty at Fort Laramie.  <b>He was the first and only Western Indian Chief to have won a war with the United States. </b></p>
<p>After the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868,  the Indians thought that they had won.  The hated forts were abandoned, the Bozeman Trail closed, and the Powder River country guaranteed as unceeded hunting grounds. All of South Dakota west of the Missouri was set aside as the Great Sioux Reservation. Their happiness was short lived. Soon there were rumors of gold in the Black Hills. Prospectors swarmed into the region. The Sioux charged the government with breaking the treaty. Many Indians left the reservation to live in the unceeded hunting grounds. Some attacked travelers on the trails fringing the Indian lands. </p>
<p>The Battle of the Little Bighorn:</p>
<p>On a hot June day in 1876,  about 2,500 Indians attacked five companies of U.S. Cavalry on a treeless Montana ridge above the Little Bighorn River. In less than an hour every soldier lay dead. This was &#8220;Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand&#8221;  &mdash;    the most spectacular triumph of the American Indian in the fight against  encroaching European civilization.</p>
<p><br>
Aftermath:<br>
Their victory was short lived. Large numbers of troops were called up and kept in the field pursuing the Indians until they surrendered. The Sioux lost their beloved Black Hills and were forced into smaller reservations in South Dakota. </p>
<p>The Crow Indians saw their enemies, the Sioux, defeated by their &#8220;allies&#8221; the white men.  The Crow regained much of the land they had lost to the Sioux. Their reservation now includes the Little Bighorn River and the battlefield area.</p>

		<p>This story speaks to a painful truth.  If you&rsquo;re white, and you live in a political jurisdiction that has at least a significant population of criminally-prone non-whites (i.e. blacks, Hispanics, Indians), then you better live your life purer than the wife of Caesar and the wind driven snow combined.  The police departments in these cities have to deal with so much grief from the rabble below (community activists, racial rabble rousers, cracker jack box ministers), and rabble from above (DOJ Civil Rights Div., Paranoia-Industrial complex eg ADL/SPLC, the news media), that they&rsquo;ll look for and find any wee slight ticky-tack thing on which to arrest white people, to balance out their enforcement race stats.</p>
