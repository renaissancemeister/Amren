			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Howard Witt, Chicago Tribune, September 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In the average New Jersey public school, African-American students are almost 60 times as likely as white students to be expelled for serious disciplinary infractions.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, black students are suspended 6 times as often as whites.</p>
<p>In Iowa, blacks make up just 5 percent of the statewide public school enrollment but account for 22 percent of the students who get suspended.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In every state but Idaho, a Tribune analysis of the data shows, black students are being suspended in numbers greater than would be expected from their proportion of the student population. In 21 states  &mdash;  Illinois among them  &mdash;  that disproportionality is so pronounced that the percentage of black suspensions is more than double their percentage of the student body. And on average across the nation, black students are suspended and expelled at nearly three times the rate of white students.</p>
<p>{snip} Hispanic students are suspended and expelled in almost direct proportion to their populations, while white and Asian students are disciplined far less.</p>
<p>Yet black students are no more likely to misbehave than other students from the same social and economic environments, research studies have found. Some impoverished black children grow up in troubled neighborhoods and come from broken families, leaving them less equipped to conform to behavioral expectations in school. While such socioeconomic factors contribute to the disproportionate discipline rates, researchers say that poverty alone cannot explain the disparities. &#8220;There simply isn&rsquo;t any support for the notion that, given the same set of circumstances, African-American kids act out to a greater degree than other kids,&#8221; said Russell Skiba, a professor of educational psychology at Indiana University whose research focuses on race and discipline issues in public schools. &#8220;In fact, the data indicate that African-American students are punished more severely for the same offense, so clearly something else is going on. We can call it structural inequity or we can call it institutional racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Studies show that a history of school suspensions or expulsions is a strong predictor of future trouble with the law  &mdash;  and the first step on what civil rights leaders have described as a &#8220;school-to-prison pipeline&#8221; for black youths, who represent 16 percent of U.S. adolescents but 38 percent of those incarcerated in youth prisons.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But academic experts say many more school administrators, when confronted with data showing disparate rates of discipline for minority students, react like officials in the small east Texas town of Paris and strenuously deny accusations of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They say there&rsquo;s no racism here, but if you go inside a school and look in the room where they send the kids for detention, almost all the faces are black,&#8221; said Brenda Cherry, a Paris civil rights activist who assembled some of the complaints that sparked the federal investigation. &#8220;Unless black people are just a bad race of people, something is wrong here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exactly why black students across the nation are suspended and expelled more frequently than children of other races is a question that continues to perplex sociologists.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor home environment does carry over into the school environment,&#8221; said Skiba, who is widely regarded as the nation&rsquo;s foremost authority on school discipline and race. &#8220;But middle-class and upper-class black students are also being disciplined more often than their white peers. Skin color in itself is a part of this function.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;White teachers feel more threatened by boys of color,&#8221; said Isela Gutierrez, a juvenile justice expert at the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, a watchdog and policy group. &#8220;They are viewed as disruptive. What might be their more assertive way of asking a question, for example, is viewed as popping off at the mouth.&#8221;</p>

		<p>So much to say&hellip;.  So here goes:</p>
<p>#1 &#8220;What might be their more assertive way of asking a question, for example, is viewed as popping off at the mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>   Uh, excuse me, this is a very stupid example.  No student gets punished for asking a question in an &#8216;assertive&rsquo; way.  CAn you imagine it?  &#8220;Yo, Mr. Smith!  I want to know why dat ekwasun be wrong!  Tell me now!&#8221;  Doesn&rsquo;t happen.  Faulty example by our token latina affirmative action hire.  No, it&rsquo;s when the black kids make threats, get in teachers&rsquo; faces and spew profanity that they get in trouble.  </p>
<p>#2  &#8220;They say there&rsquo;s no racism here, but if you go inside a school and look in the room where they send the kids for detention, almost all the faces are black,&rdquo;</p>
<p>    Uh, maybe a LOT of black kids DO cause trouble.  I taught black teens for many years and they would things on an ongoing basis that made me think I was living in the zoo.  By ongoing I mean at any and every moment there could be a shoving match, &#8216;beat down,&rsquo; sexual harassment, theft, loud shouting, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>#3  &#8220;black students are being suspended in numbers greater than would be expected from their proportion of the student population&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>   Here goes their hypocritical argument again.  When disciplining, you cannot do more than the percentage they are in a population, but for jobs and such, you can go 300-400% over their population proportion in government agencies, - and still ask for more!  They use proportion when it suits them.</p>

<p>So, Mrs. Gutierrez; please tell me why black teachers in Atlanta during the 1930&rsquo;s had baseball bats on their desks? White teachers in equivalent schools did not have weapons (beyond a paddle) sitting out in the open. </p>

		<p>Where does one begin? Random thoughts. I&rsquo;ve read in the local papers where black parents, usually mothers, believe that TEACHERs need to EARN the respect of the little @#$%. Not the other way around. Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;Blacks also teach their offspring to hate all things white. Lets&rsquo;s see.. Blacks think whites are incapable of teaching blacks.Let&rsquo;s see..blacks believe success and achievement are white and should thus be eschewed.  The obvious problems and solutions just continue to fester and remain unaddressed. The civil rights genius,Brenda Cherry, among others, continue to strain at gnats and swallow camels and ignore the huge elephant in the living room.<br>

		<p>Race differences in school discipline<br>
Vol. 22, No. 8 August 2011 <br>
American Renaissance <br>
The Galton Report<br>
by Hippocrates</p>
<p>EXCERPTS:</p>
<p> &hellip;the most common reason for school suspension and expulsion is conduct disorder (also termed behavior problems or &ldquo;oppositional defiance disorder&rdquo;), consisting of excessive aggressiveness, violence, disobedience, and criminal offenses &hellip; Many studies have reported that racial differences in this kind of behavior are similar to those in suspensions and exclusions.</p>
<p>For example, Drs. H. Feng &amp; G. Cartledge reported that conduct disorder was .49 standard deviation units higher in blacks than in whites, while it was 1.12 lower in East Asians. </p>
<p>Similar differences have been reported in Britain. Professor Michael Rutter and his colleagues reported that behavior problems assessed by teachers of 3- to 5-year-old boys and girls at inner-city schools in London showed that black boys had 3.9 times the scores of white boys, and black girls had 2.3 times the scores of white girls. Professor Barbara Tizard and her colleagues reported that the prevalence of conduct disorders was 3.9 times greater in black boys than in white boys, and 2.3 times greater in black girls than in white girls. </p>
<p>The same race differences are also present in juvenile crime. In the 1960s, Dr. M. Gold reported that the ratio of blacks to whites for criminal convictions for boys was 8.1:1, while for girls the ratio was 14.1:1. Similar race differences are found in the case of adult crime. A 2005 report by the New Century Foundation found that blacks are seven times more likely to be incarcerated than whites, and that Hispanics are three times more likely. The report also found that for virtually all crimes, Asians are incarcerated at about one third the white rate.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Ever since the 1960s, when studies of race differences in school discipline became common, researchers have stressed the importance of keeping careful race statistics. This means school administrators know their patterns of discipline will be scrutinized, and that they will be criticized for any departure from proportionality.</p>
<p>The most reasonable interpretation of all these studies is that there are racial differences in anti-social behavior &hellip;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&hellip;there are ways to check &hellip; conclusions about white incompetence [or &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;]. There are now many non-white school administrators who have disciplinary authority &hellip; If their patterns of discipline were the same as those of whites &mdash; or even showed sharper race differences &mdash; it would undercut the theory of white incompetence and bias.</p>

<p>That black school I taught in where the 4th grade went through 7 teachers in 9 months was a middle class area.  The kids were all the children of goverment workers.  I remember 4 of the teachers the 9 year olds drove off were black.<br>

		<p>The sheer mendacity at work in this article is almost too much for the brain to process. Suggesting that Black students do not misbehave or &#8220;act out&#8221; at higher rates than Whites - of ANY socio-economic background - is to say that Black teens and adults do not commit crime at higher rates than the rest of the population. Any teacher who spent five minutes in a classroom full of Black children will assure Prof. Skiba, or any of these apologists, that they are as wrong as the apparently are delusional! </p>
<p>How do they get away with such brazen falsehoods?</p>
<p>Oh, that&rsquo;s right&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how these fools lie about what anybody knows who went to school with large numbers of blacks and that is they&rsquo;re trouble-makers and are always creating problems for somebody because of their misbehavior, and oftentimes criminal conduct.</p>
<p>But, if these liars want to falsify the facts to keep blacks from being disciplined it&rsquo;s o.k. with me, because there will be even more real life examples of misconduct for unaware whites to experience, and hopefully that will make them more white oriented.  God pity the white kids who go to school with them.</p>
<p>This Howard Witt who wrote the above, if people will remember, is the liar who completely falsified the events concerning the Jena beatings, making the blacks appear as victims in spite of all proof to the contrary. </p>
<p>Why he purposely lies about these issues and incidents is a mystery to me, unless he&rsquo;s a card-carrying cultural Marxist who wants to see the US destroyed.</p>

How long can the intensively enforced delusion last? Even this &#8220;researcher&#8221; can not believe this. Of course, on an innocent aside, &#8220;scientists&#8221; always have to find something, anything to study. Though you&rsquo;d think after mountains of  evidence to the contrary, they&rsquo;d stop flogging this particular very dead horse.</p>
<p> After all, unending experience and evidence shows us, that from small childhood, right up until  very old age, blacks are vastly more criminal&hellip;oh FORGET IT!<br>
This is just ludicrous, going on stating the universe full of fact, if libtards are going to keep playing the charade.</p>
<p> But I am beginning to take heart:<br>
I see everywhere, that the Liberal machine has ground to  a near standstill, out of bromides, out of slogans, out of other people&rsquo;s money to spend, out of ideas. They&rsquo;ve lost the faux high moral ground they worked so feverishly on in the last forty years.  They know, except for the shouting, it&rsquo;s all over.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the white world outside Marxism, is so tired of Libspeak, and the raping of the schools, the rape of cities, towns and suburbs, and the crash of the economy, that the Liberal machine is going to either fall to pieces, or be ripped apart.</p>
<p>Folks, we don&rsquo;t have to endure this much longer. Listen now for very shrill cries of desperation from Academia, Government, and the shake-down groups. Their time is quickly passing. <br>
Be of GOOD CHEER. NO MORE WHINING! (Not when the tide is turning).<br>

		<p>To get at the heart of the matter you would almost have to look at each incident individually. In other words, a White kids who was suspended for fighting was likely equally matched with one other student. A black student suspended for fighting was probably part of a larger group that attacked a smaller and weaker student. With &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policies in place in many schools a 2nd grade girl attacked by a 4th grade boy can be in trouble for &#8220;fighting&#8221;. A black student that is suspended may also have a much longer disciplinary record.</p>

		<p>  &#8220;Unless black people are just a bad race of people, there&rsquo;s something wrong here.&#8221;  Well lets see.  If we take into consideration the percentage of blacks in the overall population and then look at the percentage of violent crimes that this relatively small group commits, a person not indoctrinated in political correctness and not afraid of being called a racist would rightly assume that yes this is a bad race of people.</p>

		<p>A friend is music director at a select boy&rsquo;s choir school. The school contains mostly white students plus a few blacks and asians. My friend has been told that he may use the adjective &#8220;lazy&#8221; for the white and asian students, when writing student evaluations, but never for blacks. Using &#8220;lazy&#8221; to describe the behavior of blacks would constitute racism.</p>

		<p>This huge racial difference in problem behavior has always been noted since desegregation. Teachers of all colors know the truth that white and Asian kids are better behaved overall. There are reasons for this besides differences in home environment. Black children physically mature faster and black boys tend to have higher testosterone levels than white boys of the same age (about the same for over 20yrs old).  </p>
<p>Probably the biggest reason for the discipline difference is the difference in average IQ for although a person with and IQ of 85 can function and learn well enough, the fact that the average IQ of blacks is 85 ( a little less in some states) means that there are a lot of black boys with much lower IQs and they cannot function and adapt well in modern technological societies. </p>

		<p>So much media bias.  I just read an article in the New York Post.<br>
A man saved a woman from being raped.</p>
<p>The woman was described as not just Asian, but Korean and very small.  There was a big picture of the White man who saved her.</p>
<p>The attempted rapist was described as 5&rsquo;10 and wearing a baseball cap.</p>
<p>I wonder what race he was?  When race is not mentioned we all know what race the attempted rapist is.  </p>
<p>Any journalists read this site?  Is it now forbidden to mention race of the suspect is Hispanic as well as black.</p>

		<p>This article is so offensive, I hardly know where to begin addressing it, except to say that for three decades I served as an administrator and disciplinarian for a Philadelphia high school that was 70% black, 25% Hispanic and 5% white/asian. And it was ALWAYS the black kids who exhibited the most outrageous behavior. Aside from smarmy fruitcakes like Russell Skiba (who teaches in the ivory towers of university academe, not down here in the trenches of hard-core inner-city schools where he&rsquo;d get his self-serving brand of pontification shoved right down his elitist throat), Brenda Cherry, a &#8220;civil rights activist&#8221; (meaning she&rsquo;s too incompetent to hold any kind of a REAL job), Isela Gutierrez (need I say more?) and ALL the vague &#8220;Studies show&hellip;Data indicate&hellip;&#8221; garbage cited in this piece, the fact remains that U.S. blacks, who are less than 13% of the population, account for 50% of all arrests for assault and murder, 67% of all arrests for robbery, and 33% of all arrests for fraud, forgery, counterfeiting and receiving stolen property. 75% of all FEMALES arrested are black. INTERPOL yearbooks show that rates of murder, rape and serious assault are FOUR TIMES higher in African and Caribbean countries than in Asian/Pacific Rim countries, and that violent crimes per populations of 100,000 were 35 for Asians, 42 for Europeans, and 149 for Africans! Blacks rate highest in mental instability, and drug/alcohol abuse, and results from Eysenck Personality Questionnaires and Cattell&rsquo;s Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaires show blacks registering MUCH higher in traits like impulsiveness and aggressiveness. And yet niwit Howard Witt of the Chicago Tribune has the temerity to write, &#8220;Exactly why black students across the nation are suspended and expelled more than children of other races is a question that continues to perplex sociologists.&#8221; Either Witt is an anti-white racist or American sociologists as a whole are morons or (my guess) both, but what a comfort it is to have the effete Skiba attribute it all to &#8220;structural inequity&#8221; and &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;. It makes it so much easier to comprehend why black students in 49 out of 50 states are &#8220;being suspended in numbers greater than would be expected from their proportion of the student population&#8221; (UNLIKE their imprisonment percentages, right?)I could spend MONTHS recounting the black horrors I&rsquo;ve witnessed over the past 3 decades in Philly - violent sexual assaults on teachers and grade schoolers, &#8220;beatdowns&#8221; of white six-year-olds by black teens, the outright torture of frightened Asian students - but an earlier post that referred to Philadelphia as a &#8220;hellhole&#8221; truly said it best. Philadelphia is a BLACK city - openly hostile to whites and gleefully bent on their destruction - and it IS getting worse by the day - ESPECIALLY in the schools. And why? Just ask Mr. Skiba, Ms. Cherry, and Ms. Gutierrez. They seem to have all the answers.</p>

		<p>Like Anonymous 1, I taught black teens for a number of years, at a number of different schools. I&rsquo;ve seen Black kids act out in the most egregious ways, and yet suffer no repurcussions, no punishment whatsoever from the school. (It should come as no surprise that many of the administrators were also black.)  <br>
The idea that &#8220;African American students are punished more severely for the same offense&#8221; is not only ludicrious  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s false. Often, they are not punished at all. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taught kids of all races, and not only did the black students exhibit the worst behavior  &mdash;  they systematically had the poorest academic performance.  There was always a clear pattern:  the White and Asian students came out on top, followed by the Hispanic students (some of whom did quite well), with the Black students always lagging behind everyone else.  Martel makes a good point; when one teaches black students over a number of years and sees them unable to grasp basic concepts that the other non-black students easily grasp, it becomes painfully obvious and unavoidable that there is a clear disparity between IQ levels (which has also been clearly supported through research on this topic).  </p>
<p>White teachers have a reason to feel threatened  &mdash;  because of the animalistic behaviors of some of their black students.  Given the chance, most of the time, those students will act out violently, or at the very least, in an unruly manner. They also don&rsquo;t seem to have the capacity or inclination to self-reflection that other races have and, therefore, don&rsquo;t even see (or perhaps don&rsquo;t care) how ridiculous they make themselves look to non-blacks. </p>

		<p>Bantu kids just do a lot more mayhem and when they do the mayhem they are more egregious in doing the mayhem. NOT just a fight with fists in the schoolyard. Fight, one kid knocked to the ground [whitey] and then the Bantu stomping the whitey kid. That sort of thing. And things done to the staff as well, crimes really, of a severe nature. It is not just the crime but how it &#8220;goes down&#8221;!</p>
<p>Ya&rsquo; know what I&rsquo;m saying!</p>
<p>If 70 % of the stealing is done by Bantu, expect 70 % of those locked away for stealing to be Bantu.</p>

		<p>The Denver Public Schools refuse to punish the most violent and eggregious misbehavior by blacks. Black students in Denver Public schools can swear at and even strike white teachers with no punishment whatsoever. But you are not allowed to defend yourself. I know from extensive inside experience. The lack of will to suspend and expel violent students is so bad that the result has been murder, literally, at Montbello High School in DPS. Presumably, the murderer was finally expelled. Students at West High School have even gang attacked and litterally kicked the principal while he was down (in that case they were mostly Mexican students and the Principal is Mexican-American, though).</p>
<p>Furthermore, teachers, in particular the English and Social Studies/History teachers (often white) are largley to blame for instilling the extreme violent murderous racism of black and brown young people. They constantly stress and exagerate and haarp upon white racism against blacks and Mexicans. There is almost no lesson that does not accuse and attack whites in a very extreme way (in inner city AND suburban schools, again, I know from extensive inside experience). All lessons are about white racism (and other racists simply do not exist in these courses).</p>
<p>The courses are very similar to the justly discredited ethnic studies and gender studies marxist hate mongering in our universities. In addition, the black employees of the schools attack the white employees unjustly. Denver schools is a hotbed of racism against whites. I suspect that all big city districts are like this and I know that even all of the suburban districts promote this anti-white activism of the so-called multi-cultural variety. How could this occur and not engender violence against whites?</p>
<p>As for the behavior of most black students in the Denver Public Schools, their behavior is so eggregious and horrible that it would be hard to believe unless you see it with your own eyes (again, the vast majority of black students). I have seen hundreds and hundreds of hours of it with my own eyes. I assure you that most of these black students (95%) are the most extreme, violent, and hateful of racists. The results can be seen on the streets, witness the violent gang attack on the 16th street mall recently and the violent beating, mauling and robbing of whites in 2009 in the Lo-Do (lower downtown) area of Denver. The beatings by gangs of blacks put their victims in the hospital AND THE PRESS AND DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT COVERED IT UP FOR AS LONG AS THEY COULD! It went on for months before the public was allowed to know the truth! Think of all of the whites that could have avoided hospitalization and losing the sight in one eye if they had been warned of the danger! Some of the victims had smashed face bones!</p>
<p>SO AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH RADICAL MULTICULTURALIST MARXIST TEACHERS AND THANK YOU COWERING POLITICALLY CORRECT COPS! STAND UP FOR YOUR OWN PEOPLE WHITES!</p>

		<p>The reason why black students are more likely to get detention is that it is a badge of honor for blacks. Black culture teaches that being in trouble with authority is a good thing. The blacks in detention are very proud to be there as that shows that they fight back against rules. Juvenile correction facilities and adult prison are part of black culture and blacks are proud of it.</p>

		<p>This is a timely article. A black student was suspended at my son&rsquo;s school today. In fact, he was suspended for attacking my son. The black student was several years older and more than twice his size. And my son had never even seen him before. The black just walked up and started wailing on him out of the blue. And it was actually caught on video. I&rsquo;m currently in a battle with the school to view it. They&rsquo;re saying its &#8220;against school policy&#8221; for me to see it.</p>

		<p>I noticed that they made no mention of the race breakdown of the teachers that were sending these Black kids to detention.  If the teachers were White, they most certainly would have mentioned that because it would lend credence to the racism arguement.  I&rsquo;m going to go out on a limb here and guess that the majority of the teachers in these high Black population schools are also Black.  That&rsquo;s also why they assert the claim, &#8220;institutional racism&#8221;.  It&rsquo;s a strawman that you can&rsquo;t really prove or disprove, but it sounds credible because it explains away an inconvienient truth.</p>

		<p>The answer to this perceived injustice is quite simple.  The &#8220;experts&#8221; should be forced to spend a few months either sitting in classrooms full of Black teens, or watching hidden camera feeds from same. </p>
<p>For a bonus, they should be treated to hidden camera feeds from the isolated areas of the bigger schools where teachers rarely see what is going on - the corners, remote hallways, locker rooms, bathrooms.  After they see the incredible abuse that swarms of Black kids deal out to the other students, the experts might finally shut their traps and start focusing on making the children behave in class long enough to actually learn something.</p>
<p>At some point, White Americans will hopefully start ignoring the media baloney and instead learn to trust their own experiences and judgment.  No one who has ever spent any amount of time in a classroom with Blacks could possibly have any problem understanding why they are disciplined more often.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because they cause more chaos, disruption, and problems than any other group of kids.  </p>
<p>As for WHY they cause more problems, many of us are simply past the point of caring.  Their issues, whatever they may be, do not justify our administrators letting them turn our own children&rsquo;s learning experience into a &#8220;Lord of the Flies&#8221; nightmare.  Give Black kids their own special schools where they can rampage to their hearts&rsquo; content, and let the rest of the kids get on with their lives and the desperate struggle to reclaim 1st world status for the rapidly decaying United States.</p>

<p><br>
&#8220;African and African-American children have a different way of learning. [&hellip;] When [schools] were desegregated in Philadelphia [in 1950s], several of the <b>white teachers in my school freaked out.</b> Why? Because <b>black kids wouldn&rsquo;t stay in their place. Over there behind the desk, black kids climbed up all on them.</b>&#8221;</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In fact, the data indicate that African-American students are punished more severely for the same offense, so clearly something else is going on. We can call it structural inequity or we can call it institutional racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or maybe repeat offenses are punished more severely, hence an African boy misbehaving for the 30th time will receive greater punishment than White child does for a first offense.  Same offense, different punishments, no bias.</p>
<p>In baseball the third strike is punished more harshly than the first and second. Sooner or later one of these civil rights champions will object that an African player was called &#8220;out&#8221; for a strike (his third) and a White player was allowed to continue playing after a strike (his first or second). They&rsquo;ll call it &#8220;institutional racism&#8221; there, too. And their argument will be just as sound then as it is now.</p>

<p>When my car needs to be fixed or the roof leaks I don&rsquo;t spend any time at all worrying about the why.  I take the car to a trusted mechanic.  I put a big pot under the leak and as soon as the rain stops I call in a roofer.  I go up there with him to check out the damage and repairs needed before I write him a check.</p>
<p>Problem solved.  If I spent time wondering about causes I wouldn&rsquo;t have a working car and my ceilings would have come down by now.</p>
<p>Black kids need black teachers and administrators.  When I was a young teacher I met quite a few older black teachers who got their start in the segregated schools of the south.</p>
<p>They all claimed that the black kids behaved well under black teachers.  They all boasted of how they enforced decent behavior with severe physical discipline, belts and paddles.</p>
<p>They blamed Whitey for ending the use of physical punishment in schools and causing the disipline problems.</p>
<p>Everything is Whitey&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>We were warned to never touch a kid because it would lead to the reverends marching on the school with false accusations of molestation and assault and battery.  We were even told to keep our nails very short to avoid an accidental scratch that could be blown up by the revs and the mammas.</p>

<p>Let me get to it. First, what harsh punishment are they referring to? The problem with blacks in School, or majority black and brown Schools, is that there is no discipline, whatsoever. </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem. They run around wild in the streets, so when they get to those large Institutions called Schools, they are doing the same thing. They have no boundaries, or borders, or respect for any authority.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Teachers that work in these environments don&rsquo;t earn anything near what they should make, perhaps one million dollars a year. Even then, it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it for me. </p>

<p>This reminds me of the article where the actual killer is interviewed on TV at the crime scene. The killer asks, &#8220;is it safe to even walk around this town with people just dying and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to this article black children are getting these suspensions out of the blue from out of nowhere like a bolt of lighting has come down and struck them with a suspension notice. No word in the entire article on what anyone did to get a suspension. </p>

<p>This is just a outright lie.  No need to read anything else in this article.  </p>

		<p>Ummm I guess my direct experience of my three years of junior high with many Blacks was just a bad dream. Not quite. For many years afterward I would not talk about to anyone. They would not have believed me unless they went to school with Blacks. To a shy, studious White boy they were a nightmare. They are very dumb, aggressive, mature quicker and are not a separate race to me, but a separate species. They made my life a living hell. Any parent who sends their White kid to a Black dominated school just do not know the torture they are subjecting them to.The question I have is it possible that the author of this article actually believes what they say? Or are they just another politically correct idiot?</p>

<p>Much like the ending of Raiders of the Lost Ark when Indy asks who&rsquo;s researching the Ark.  The government agent just says  &#8220;top men.&#8221;  Who and when aren&rsquo;t important.  Just know that &#8220;studies&#8221; were done and they agree completely with the author&rsquo;s premise.  He wouldn&rsquo;t lie.  </p>

		<p>Do you know what one of the best public school teaching jobs is?</p>
<p>It is teaching in juvenile detention facilities.  The minute a thug gets out of line a guard is called and the thug is put back in his cell.</p>
<p>Only those who behave like normal students are allowed to stay in class.  It is a privilege to go to class and get out of the cells.  So they behave.</p>
<p>Teachers connive and scheme for years to get out of the regular school jungles and into the civilized juvenile jail schools.</p>
<p>By law they must have schooling.  But there is no law that says they can behave like public high school thugs.</p>
<p>There are some hardcore juvenile facilities where the thugs are brought in by guards and placed in locked, secure individual cages before the teacher arrives.  Guards remain in the room.</p>
<p>By law they must be schooled.  But there is no law that says they can disrupt the classrooms and beat and kill each other and the teacher.  Thus the cages.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;But middle-class and upper-class black students are also being disciplined more often than their white peers. Skin color in itself is [only]  a part of this function.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
I&rsquo;m glad you have said that. Skin alone is NOT a determinant of race.  It is only one, among many, determinants of race&hellip;. though it is perhaps the most obvious one.  It is not always a reliable one.</p>

		<p>The idea that &ldquo;African American students are punished more severely for the same offense&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
that reminds me of something I saw on TV in Germany, sometime in the eighties. I never forgot it.  A black guy was postulating on this program, that in order to be accepted for a job in a profession in the US as a black, you have to be twice as capable as the white counterpart. </p>
<p><br>
In their mind they think they are twice as smart and get punished more severe.  Unfortunately my blooming liberal son in law would not believe a word we say and agree with the &#8220;Institutional racism&#8221; verdict.</p>
