			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hispanics are less likely to donate organs than the rest of America despite the fact they make up 45 per cent of patients on the waiting list.</p>
<p>The Hispanic community&rsquo;s reticence about donating organs could lead to a crisis within the field of donation, particularly as the Hispanic population is soaring.</p>
<p>Their lack of willingness to donate centres on religion as many believe that without a whole body, they will not be able to get into heaven.</p>
<p>When Norma Garcia&rsquo;s 13-year-old daughter was killed in a car wreck, she had no idea that in the midst of her grief she was about to plunge into a controversy that would test her cultural identity, Christian faith and cause a rift in the family.</p>
<p>After Jasmine Garcia was declared brain dead following the 2001 accident, doctors at San Antonio&rsquo;s University Hospital asked her mother if she would be willing to donate her daughter&rsquo;s organs.</p>
<p>She said: &#8216;The majority of my family had a belief that, &#8220;How could you do that? How could you allow her to be mutilated? How could you let them take her heart out?&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8216;My parents are from Mexico, and they had the feeling that, &#8220;She is your daughter. Why would you allow them to do this to her?&#8221;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Garcia ultimately made an organ donation of Jasmine&rsquo;s heart and liver, a decision that left her estranged from several relatives for some time, she recalled.</p>
<p>Her experience highlights the cultural divide that organ donation advocates say is threatening the ability of surgeons to save lives through organ transplants, especially as new census figures show the nation&rsquo;s Hispanic population surging.</p>
<p>First- and second-generation Mexican-Americans are the least likely to donate organs, according to organ donation experts.</p>
<p>Esmeralda Perez of the Texas Organ Sharing Alliance said: &#8216;We find that the Hispanic community tells us, &#8220;My religion says not to donate&#8221;, and &#8220;I can&rsquo;t have an open casket because the body will be damaged&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8216;They feel that their loved one will be disfigured, or the person will not be able to get into heaven because their body will not be whole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In South Texas along the Rio Grande from Brownsville to Laredo, where Latinos make up the vast majority of 1.4 million residents  &mdash;  many of them first-generation Mexican-Americans  &mdash;  organs from just 19 individuals were donated in 2010, according to the alliance.</p>
<p>She said that 45 per cent of patients on the national waiting list to receive organs are Hispanic.</p>
<p>Nuvia Enriquez, Hispanic outreach coordinator for the Donor Network of Arizona, said they are trying to dissolve some of the myths that Latinos hold on organ donation and religion. </p>
<p>She said: &#8216;We talk to them about the Catholic Church&rsquo;s position on donation, which is very positive. Pope John Paul II was actually the first pope to declare donation to be an act of love, and Pope Benedict, when he was Cardinal, was a card-carrying organ donor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Garcia said her relatives, who once so strongly criticized her decision to donate Jasmine&rsquo;s organs, have since become big supporters of organ donation.</p>
<p>&#8216;After we all got more educated, and the family started attending these events where donors&rsquo; families meet organ recipients, and seeing how much of a difference this has made in the lives of others and the good they could do for all these people, and how this was keeping Jasmine&rsquo;s memory alive, I think they realized it was the right decision,&rsquo; she said.</p>

		<p>As noted, the Catholic church is all in favor of organ donations, so that&rsquo;s not something to blame the Church for. No, the reticence of Hispanics to donate organs is superstition. Since they have such a high rate of need for organs, then only when donations are on an equal basis, should they be allowed to get organs. Again, they have the sense of entitlement about this, I&rsquo;m sure, as they do everything else. </p>

		<p>This is exactly why I refuse to donate.  Religion aside I know my organs will go to someone that hates me.  Most white people get donations from friends and family members and do not need to go on a waiting list, or at least less often than minorities do.</p>
<p>Call me selfish, I don&rsquo;t care.  the only way I would donate is if I could specify who gets my organs.  But I won&rsquo;t hold me breath on that one.  But if it did happen, here would be a new headline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Organ donors racist, study shows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boo hoo.  Don&rsquo;t ask for my organs, try your voodoo.</p>

		<p>Gee, according to the organ donor recruitment posters I see in public buildings, Hispanics are 20% of donors, as are Blacks and Orientals.  Whites should be ashamed, 60% of the population but only 40% of the organ donors.  Or is it possible that the photos are staged?  </p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t sound right.  Do these people not get tonsils and appendixes removed?  No woman get a hysterectomy?  Nobody gets a cancerous organ removed or undergo any amputation?<br>

		<p>It has long been my feeling that Hispanics have odd   &mdash;   perhaps even primitive   &mdash;   views on religion. </p>
<p>Rather than naming their children after one of the Gospel writers or prophets in the Bible, they name them after Jesus himself. This puts them in somewhat the same class as the Muslims who name their children after Mohammed. They don&rsquo;t see it as tacky or disrespectful to have tattoos of Jesus scrawled across their back. And yet, they have the odd notion that one cannot ascend into heaven if one&rsquo;s organs are not all present at burial. Perhaps it&rsquo;s another sign of a somewhat lower IQ.</p>
<p>It seems to me that after decomposition, no organs are present, but that&rsquo;s just me. </p>
<p>Anyway, this problem would probably be solved very quickly if people were allowed to receive payment for organ donation. Then I suspect that all piety would quickly go out the door.</p>

		<p>When receiving a new liver or kidney isn&rsquo;t the bad one removed and discarded first?  Am I to believe that Hispanics keep the discarded organ in a jar to be buried with them when the time comes?  Something is wrong here.  I think the truth is that they don&rsquo;t want an evil YT to get their kidney, but are more than happy to take the organ of a young white victim of a drunken illegal alien.</p>

<p><br>
According to Mexicans, a human heart should only be removed if you&rsquo;re planning to EAT the heart, so as to absorb the strength and wisdom of your dead enemy for yourself. You know, like Quetzalcoatl. </p>
<p>But taking out a heart and NOT eating it? Surgically transplanting that heart so that someone else might live? Now that&rsquo;s just crazy talk!</p>

		<p>One idea that might help is EVERYONE recieving any type of transplant MUST sign (irrevocable) documents that his or her organs may be taken at their time of death.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t want to give up their ticket to heaven BUT they have no problem taking away someone elses?</p>
<p>blacks are also notorious for DEMANDING organs when they as a group donate at almost the zero level.<br>
Then again maybe this is just their culture and I am a racist for saying this? But to me it seems like they love to take (Hep) anytime they can get it but seldom offer it to anyone else?</p>

		<p>#8 Cousin Charlie from TN &hellip;<br>
I may note that Orthodox Jews hold similar views - in Israel they even have a voluntary police unit to collect the parts after bombings. At least in early Christian understanding the resurrection was meant to be &#8220;in the flesh&#8221;. Same with Muslims - all the parts have to be interred together so the archangels can find them. And there are enough &#8220;Christian&#8221; denominations who refuse even blood transfusions.</p>
<p>- As for me, I do not believe there is such a thing as a &#8220;right to rot&#8221;, and the law should reflect that.<br>
Heresaround, emergency physicians (a particularly cynical bunch, only the pathologists are worse) refer to motorcycle accidents as &#8220;organ donors&#8221;, as their organs are in better shape than those with half a year of intensive care. So what? Salvage everything that´s still usable.(though I somewhat share Seneca the Younger´s reservations :)</p>
<p>- The reason Hispanics are so overrepresented on the waiting list is not that they have no friends or family (g) but, I would say, that as mongrels they have more genetic incompatibilities. The problem has long been known in mulattoes (as is the lack of enthusiasm for donating).</p>

		<p>I grew up in a rock-solid Catholic area, largely Slav (Pennsylvania coal region) and find these attitudes familiar.  We were suspicious of organ donation  &mdash;  found it a bit shocking  &mdash;  as yes, all parts of the body were supposed to be in the grave together, so the body could be reconstructed intact at the Second Coming of Christ.  </p>
<p>Amputations were not an issue; in fact we had a lot of respect for knife-happy &#8220;tough&#8221; surgeons who would choose amputation over &#8220;softer&#8221; solutions.  The amputated limb would be buried at what would become the burial site for the rest of the person.  </p>
<p>I have no idea what they did with removed kidneys etc.  I assume appendices and tonsils were considered useless and so were OK to become biological waste. <br>

		<p>I think the low hispanic and black organ donation rates are because they are more selfish and less altruistic than whites.  Because of this, I won&rsquo;t donate to anyone but family and friends.  And no charity devoted to the third world or our own &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; will ever get a penny from me.

		<p>   I used to have it on my license that I was an organ donor . But then I came to the conclusion that it was big business . Your organs may be worth more than you are . <br>
   <br>
   So you&rsquo;re very incapacitated after an accident, you can&rsquo;t respond . The person who decides to harvest your organs just may be motivated by something other than compassion, like money . Selfish ? Perhaps, but better safe than sorry .</p>
<p>   Over thirty years ago they grew a human ear on the back of a mouse . They keep promising, &#8221; lab grown organs,&#8221; let&rsquo;s get the show on the road . Instead of spending taxpayers money on endless foreign wars and foreign aid to bolster those who hate us anyway, spend it on research and development for America .</p>
