			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Democracy Now! March 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DANNY GLOVER: Well, I&rsquo;m here [in Johannesburg] to accompany my friend, President Aristide, home back to Haiti. I&rsquo;m here on behalf of his family and himself. He&rsquo;s a very close friend of mine. And not only that, he has been issued permission by the Haitian government to come home. He has the right to return home. And I&rsquo;m here to accompany him home.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: The State Department has issued essentially a warning that says the Aristides should not be coming home before the election. What is your response?</p>
<p>DANNY GLOVER: Well, first of all, President Aristide  &mdash;  the State Department has said essentially that President Aristide left voluntarily from Haiti seven years ago. He did not leave voluntarily. We all know that; history recounts that, what happened.</p>
<p>And the fact that, also, that he is going home to be of assistance in the rebuilding of Haiti, his plans to be involved in building educational institutions and hospitals, etc., is an indication that he is there to be a part of the renewal and rebuilding of Haiti. And my  &mdash;  certainly the State Department has its own reasons for not having him back at all, because this is the first time President Aristide would have been in the hemisphere since he was deposed seven years ago. But he is coming back to be with his people. He is coming back home with his family. So, I&rsquo;m here to be a part of that journey with him.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>DANNY GLOVER: Well, it&rsquo;s obvious that everyone&rsquo;s under a great deal of pressure in this situation. First of all, we have a situation in Haiti not only as a result of the earthquake, but the ongoing destabilization over the last 20 years of the Haitian government, disempowerment of the Haitian people at the same time. So the pressure  &mdash;  yes, the South Africans, but the South Africans are clearly  &mdash;  says, &#8220;We can&rsquo;t keep him here against his will.&#8221; And he has had permission to come home. And certainly, I think we should focus on the work that he intends to do, the work that he wants to do, in the reconstruction of Haiti.</p>
<p>AMY GOODMAN: {snip} Danny, quick question. That is, you&rsquo;re dealing not with the Bush administration, but with the Obama administration, in putting this pressure on the Aristides not to return home.</p>
<p>DANNY GLOVER: Well, that&rsquo;s the disappointing aspect of that. We elected a president on the idea of a change that we could see, a change that we could believe in. And certainly, it seems as if the Bush policy of keeping Aristide away from the Haitian people, keeping him out of the country, out of the region, is still in force. And that&rsquo;s really disheartening.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And so, we look at the election itself, and all the information on this election, this past  &mdash;  the first round of election, suggests that the election was not a valid  &mdash;  it should have been  &mdash;  the election should have been  &mdash;  should have not been approved, the results of the election. Only a quarter of the Haitians actually voted in this election. And this way of trying to push through  &mdash;  push through this now second round  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;m talking about the election itself.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m separating the two. I&rsquo;m separating, certainly, Aristide&rsquo;s right to return as a Haitian citizen, right to return, and the idea of the election itself, you know? So it seems as if there&rsquo;s some sort of  &mdash;  something is afoot with relationship to how people envision the new Haiti, and that doesn&rsquo;t include, I believe, the voice of the people. Women have signed onto petitions. People within all aspects, all levels of Haitian society have requested that Haiti receive its past president, its president back.</p>

		<p>Glover is a joke, he&rsquo;s the Sean Penn of black folks. Just another self congratulating elitist. I worked on a film titled Freedom Song, during the shooting in NC during an August heat wave the stars, director and the freedom fighting civil rights hero the movie was about sat under the shade tree with white assistants running about waiting on their every need. Now directly in front of them in plain view, stuffed in a alley with no breeze next to some horrendously smelly port a potties baking in the midday sun was a large number of extras,local black kids decked out in vintage 60&rsquo;s polyester clothing which was about like wearing a plastic bag. It was about 110 F and the kids were kept in the alley waiting on whatever, I walked over to check em out and a fight broke out due to the heat etc and I wondered why didnt these kids have water and shade? Then I wondered how long it would take for our crusading Black super stars and Jewish director to notice the plight of these kids.I waited and waited. Well they never did notice so a friend and I made some off the cuff comments to other crew,grabbed a cooler that was for the crew and dragged it over and others realized the situation and joined in. I had to laugh that it took an evil ol southern white male to notice the Black kids were in a dangerous situation with high heat and no water, the thought never crossed Glover&rsquo;s mind to help out these kids. I imagine hes in this for the same reasons, for the accolades and ego, consequences to the Haitians wont even register to him.</p>

		<p>My understanding is that Aristide was a democratically elected president overthrown in a U.S. backed coup. Is that mistaken?</p>

		<p>From what I&rsquo;ve seen and read, black people are by and large not charitable to each other.  They assume that other blacks are out to get whatever they can, from whites, blacks, or whoever.  They don&rsquo;t donate to black causes or foster black children.  They have high rates of abortion and child mistreatment and abandonment.  They assault and murder one another with little or no conscience.  <br>
People like Danny Glover are, in my opinion, interested in other blacks only in their relation to whites.  Whites forced Aristide out, so Danny&rsquo;s gonna bring him back.  And Amy Goodman, the interviewer for this piece, is as bad a white doormat for minorities that ever lived.  </p>

		<p>Yes, Aristide is the democratically elected president of Haiti overthrown in a US coup. And he is probably a better president than Haiti is used to.</p>
<p>But Danny Glover and Amy Goodman completely fail to understand the real causes of Haiti&rsquo;s problems: that it is full of Haitians, and run by Haitians. And Haitians are genetically and culturally different from the people in successful countries.<br>

		<p>Aristide: former Roman Catholic cleric; champion of the &#8220;oppressed&#8221;; the moment he gets into power, his attention shifts from his supporters to his own bank account. Typical Haitian politician  &mdash;  no reason to expect anything different from Haiti, ever.</p>

		<p>The America hating racist Danny Glover should stay with his friend Aristide over in Haiti.  We will not miss his whining and crying and bad movies.  Don&rsquo;t let the door hit you in the butt on the way out Danny!</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d completely written off Danny Glover as a whacked-out liberal nitwit.  Then, he came out in support of his friend Mel Gibson.  Now, I am thinking of him with just a little less animosity today.</p>

		<p>To 5-Anonymous:</p>
<p>My impression of Aristide is that he wasn&rsquo;t corrupt, but my impression is formed principally from the commie radio station here in Berkeley and it&rsquo;s internet TV offshoot, Democracy Now, so my mind is open if you would supply some evidence.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that he is not corrupt, since if he were, I would think he would likely have also been pliable in acceding to U.S. wishes and there would have been no need to overthrow him.</p>

		<p>Why does anything these twisted attention-mongers in Hollywood say garner any press at all by anything but the entertainment venues? Charile Sheen, Lindsay Lohan, Danny Glover; I wouldn&rsquo;t get up off my couch to answer the door for any of them. It&rsquo;s a sad state off affairs how much Americans spend of their time and money on these needy, greedy athletes and so-called actors.</p>

		<p>Danny Glover is just another example of a black man who hates the U.S. and white people.</p>
<p>But of course he has no intention of leaving us.</p>
<p>At least his movie careeer is D.O.A.</p>
