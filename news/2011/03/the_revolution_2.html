Readers of AR may find some of these arguments useful.</p><table class="boxright">

        <p>Our society is filled with debates, whether over the air, in
 print, in classrooms, or in private conversation. These debates are 
what establish the &#8220;opinions&#8221; of the vast majority of Americans who do 
not have ideas of their own. Most people absorb what they hear around 
them and are most likely to absorb what they hear most often. Americans 
encounter dissident views on race so infrequently they will not be 
persuaded through simple repetition. A defense of white racial 
consciousness must therefore be clear, even arresting, in order to have 
an effect.</p>
        <p> <b>&#8216;Racism&rsquo;</b> </p>
        <p> Unfortunately, the other side has, until recently, so 
dominated the debate and so grossly misrepresented our views that anyone
 who departs from racial orthodoxy will at some point have to contend 
with the charge of &#8220;racism.&#8221; &#8220;That&rsquo;s a racist statement,&#8221; your opponent 
will say, in a tone that suggests he has just dropped a nuclear bomb, 
and for timid people   &mdash;   about 95 percent of whites   &mdash;   that ends the 
argument. The &#8220;racist&#8221; apologizes, back-peddles, and shrivels into 
silence. </p>
        <p> You, of course, are not going to do that, but the whole 
&#8220;racism&#8221; issue means you must defend against an accusation, and gets in 
the way of making positive arguments. Some racial advocates try to put 
opponents on the defensive by asking them to define &#8220;racism,&#8221; but this 
is a bad mistake. First, it gives your opponent the floor, whereas you 
should be using the time to make your own points, not letting him 
explain why you are a bad person. Second, you will not get a definition.
 You will get a long list of things like slavery, segregation, 
apartheid, genocide of the Indians, colonialism, Jim Crow, etc., 
followed by, &#8220;That&rsquo;s what racism is.&#8221; If it is a public debate and your 
opponent is trying to prove his virtue by being nasty to you, he may 
add, &#8220;and it was racists like you who did those things.&#8221; </p>
        <p> The fact that the &#8220;racism&#8221; accusation is usually so 
effective is actually an advantage for us, because the people who make 
it have probably never seen it fail. You therefore have an opportunity 
to shock them by walking away from ground zero without a scratch. If you
 are in a radio debate, or some other forum in which you need to save 
time, deflect the &#8220;racism&#8221; charge in a light-hearted way by saying, 
&#8220;Come on, say something original.&#8221; No one ever expects that reply, and 
during the surprised pause that follows you can make a positive rather 
than defensive argument. </p>
        <p> If the &#8220;racism&#8221; argument comes up again   &mdash;   and often it won&rsquo;t
   &mdash;   or if you want to go on the attack, you might say: &#8220;Don&rsquo;t you realize
 that you&rsquo;re not making an argument any more? When you call me a 
&#8220;racist,&rsquo; all you&rsquo;re doing is calling me names. Of course, when you&rsquo;re 
reduced to name-calling it&rsquo;s the most graceless way of admitting you&rsquo;ve 
lost the argument.&#8221; </p>
        <p> If someone calls you a &#8220;racist,&#8221; he has completely shifted 
his ground and isn&rsquo;t dealing with facts or logic anymore. He is saying 
&#8220;You&rsquo;re bad!&#8221;, which is pure emotion. Prof. Michael Levin, author of <i>Why Race Matters,</i>
 says this kind of childish outburst makes no more sense than calling 
someone a &#8220;poopoohead.&#8221; Grownups do it only because it works, and it 
works only because so many whites are invertebrates. </p>
        <p> The silliness of the &#8220;racism&#8221; charge is especially clear if 
you are talking about racial differences in IQ. Just point out that the 
only legitimate issue is how to interpret the evidence. Your conclusions
 are either right or wrong. If someone stops trying to explain why you 
are wrong and instead starts calling you names, it&rsquo;s a sure sign he <i>can&rsquo;t</i> explain why you are wrong   &mdash;   which is because you are right. </p>
        <p> A somewhat milder way to make the same point is to evoke a 
more innocuous racial difference, especially one favorable to blacks. 
Point out that many researchers think blacks have more inherent athletic
 ability than whites. This is a scientific question of interpreting the 
evidence, and is just like evaluating the evidence for IQ differences. 
Is it &#8220;racist&#8221; to conclude that blacks are better athletes than whites? 
Once again, anyone who accuses you of racism is no longer thinking 
logically and is making an emotional, <i>ad hominem </i>appeal out of desperation. </p>
        <p> Likewise, in the context of any discussion of race and IQ, 
it disarms the opposition to point out that the very same evidence for 
higher white than black IQ suggests north Asians have higher IQs than 
whites. It is an odd form of &#8220;racism&#8221; to reach conclusions unfavorable 
to whites. </p>

        <p> Accusations of &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; are less common than 
&#8220;racism,&#8221; but are easy to defeat. There is no harm in becoming 
indignant. &#8220;White supremacy is the desire to be supreme, to rule over 
others, to oppress them,&#8221; you say. &#8220;Not a thing I have ever said so much
 as hints at that. This is nothing more than ignorant name-calling.&#8221; 
Occasionally someone will call you a &#8220;white separatist.&#8221; This is a 
somewhat less emotion-laden term, but to many people it still implies 
forcible separation with fire hoses and snarling police dogs. I find the
 best reply is, &#8220;I believe in complete freedom of association.&#8221; This 
turns an accusation into an opportunity to make a positive point. </p>

        <p> Undoubtedly the greatest threat to whites today comes from 
immigration. Racial preferences, guilt-mongering, anti-Western 
education, even anti-white violence are manageable problems compared to a
 process that is displacing whites and reducing them to a minority. With
 a change in thinking at the right levels, anti-white policies and 
double standards could be done away with practically overnight, but that
 would still leave us with nearly 100 million non-whites living in the 
country. Demographic displacement would be difficult to reverse even 
with a radical change in popular thinking. In their bones, whites know 
this. They are profoundly disturbed by the thought that their 
grandchildren could be racial minorities in a largely black-and-Hispanic
 America. Therefore, I find that one of the most effective and important
 points we can make is that this is not inevitable, and that we have 
every right to oppose an immigration policy that hastens this process. 
What is the best way to approach this? </p>
        <p> One of the characteristics of whites is that they must believe their political positions are <i>fair.</i>
 It is not sufficient justification that something merely be in their 
interests. I believe this is one of the distinguishing virtues of 
European peoples, but in the dangerous game of demographic competition, 
it is a potentially fatal flaw. </p>
        <p> People of other races seldom worry about fairness. If 
something is good for them, they support it, no matter how unfair it may
 to others. &#8220;Affirmative action&#8221; is an obvious example. It makes <i>no difference</i>
 to most blacks or Hispanics that preferences for them require 
discrimination against whites. Preferences are good for them, so they 
want them. They don&rsquo;t care if whites suffer. </p>
        <p> The current fuss over the disfranchisement of felons 
reflects the same thinking. Blacks are much more likely than whites to 
be felons, so disfranchisement hits them hardest. Blacks don&rsquo;t even make
 a pretense of coming up with principled reasons why released prisoners 
should vote. All they need to know is that changing the rules would mean
 more black voters, more black elected officials, and more power and 
benefits for blacks. No further justification is necessary. </p>
        <p> In a radio debate about reparations for slavery, my black 
opponent openly admitted that all he cared about was advantage for 
blacks. &#8220;If we are to pay up for past wrongs,&#8221; I asked him, &#8220;do we owe 
reparations to women because they couldn&rsquo;t vote until 1920? What kind of
 principle are you establishing here?&#8221; &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care about other 
groups,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m talking about reparations for African-Americans.&#8221;
 A white would not have felt he could completely ignore the notion that 
there should be consistent rules that apply to all groups. </p>
        <p> We find this same lack of concern for principle in virtually
 every black attitude. Slavery practiced by whites 150 years ago is an 
abiding evil for which we owe compensation, but slavery practiced in 
Africa by blacks <i>today</i> is of no interest or significance. The 
current black obsession with slavery is therefore not principled 
opposition but a way to hector whites. </p>
        <p> Blacks support welfare, the Democrats, abolition of the 
death penalty, extension of federal power, progressive income taxes, and
 government set-asides for the same straightforward reasons. They were 
glad to see O.J. Simpson beat the murder conviction, not because he was 
innocent but because he is black. Anything good for blacks is good. Many
 blacks go even further: Anything <i>bad for whites</i> is good. This simple, unprincipled mentality keeps blacks united in support of their own interests. </p>
        <p> Whites, to their credit and their hurt, don&rsquo;t think this way, and this is why every racial argument <i>must</i>
 be couched in terms of fairness. Whites will not respond to 
mirror-images of the appeals that work for blacks. Whites are the only 
people on earth who have to be convinced that it is <i>not unfair</i> 
for them to survive as a majority race in homelands of their own. This 
is a terrible sickness, and can be cured only with an appeal to fairness
 rather than to simple group interests. You should always emphasize that
 you want nothing for whites you are not happy to grant to all other 
peoples: The freedom to be left alone to pursue their destinies. </p>

        <p> Equal treatment is so basic to the idea of fairness that 
even children understand it. This is why the arguments for our side that
 work best are almost invariably of the 
what-if-the-shoe-were-on-the-other-foot variety. John Ney, in a 1982 
pamphlet called &#8220;Miami Today   &mdash;   The U.S. Tomorrow,&#8221; makes a reciprocity 
argument I have been using ever since: What if hundreds of thousands of 
poor, white Americans were pouring illegally across the border into 
Mexico, demanding school instruction in English, celebrating Fourth of 
July rather than Cinco de Mayo, turning entire communities into 
white-American enclaves, demanding open borders, operating criminal 
gangs, and even talking darkly about breaking off a chunk of northern 
Mexico and turning it into an all-white republic? Could the Mexicans be 
tricked into thinking this was a delightful form of cultural enrichment?
 No. Mexicans would be outraged and would call out the army to stop it. </p>
        <p> The same argument works for all non-white countries. Would 
it be fair to expect Nigerians to accept huge flows of Asians, say, who 
were going to reduce black Nigerians to a minority in a few decades? 
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be right for Nigerians to oppose this? Whites understand 
this principle perfectly when the victims of displacement are not white.
 It is even trendy to oppose China&rsquo;s program of sending Han Chinese into
 Tibet to obliterate Tibetan culture. Whites recognize that even the 
most primitive, stone-age people of the Amazon or New Guinea deserve to 
be left alone and not have their culture swamped by outsiders. It is 
only when the problem of white dispossession is presented as a clear 
parallel to the obvious injustice of non-white dispossession that most 
whites begin to realize they have a moral case for survival. Obvious as 
this approach really is, most whites have never thought about the 
problem this way, and it can make a strong impression. </p>
        <p> Here is another way to put the case for equal treatment. It 
is clear that Hispanics (and every other immigrant group in the country)
 want their numbers to grow. Hispanics want more Hispanics because their
 interests are different from ours and they want their interests to 
prevail. They want elected officials, official Spanish, celebration of 
their holidays and folkways. They want the United States to reflect <i>them.</i> As non-Hispanics, we want the country to reflect <i>us.</i>
 Entirely aside from the fact that Europeans founded this country and 
established its institutions, our desires are perfectly symmetrical to 
those of Hispanics: They want the country more Hispanic; we want it 
less. <i>Why are their desires legitimate but ours reprehensible</i>? 
There is no answer to this question. Again, if we imagine the situation 
reversed   &mdash;   white Americans in Mexico trying to remake the country in 
their own image   &mdash;   there would be no question about who was right. </p>
        <p> A different way of saying the same thing is to ask someone 
to imagine what the Southwest United States would be like if it were 
invaded and conquered by Mexico. Americans and their culture and society
 would be displaced by Mexicans. Americans would become refugees and 
flee to parts of the country not yet conquered. That, of course, is 
precisely what is happening to large parts of the Southwest. Mexicans 
are achieving the effects of conquest   &mdash;   many openly call it <i>reconquista</i>
   &mdash;   without firing a shot. Why must we accept and even celebrate the very
 thing nations send their young men into battle to prevent? </p>
        <p> Here is another equal-treatment argument based on white 
Americans&rsquo; love of self-criticism. Years ago, we used to hear the 
expression &#8220;ugly American.&#8221; It meant Americans who went to other 
countries and expected the people to speak English, who wanted to find 
American food, and who generally expected foreign countries to act 
American. This, of course, was universally condemned. Why, then, do we 
invite foreigners in the United States to act like &#8220;ugly Mexicans&#8221; and 
&#8220;ugly Haitians&#8221; who expect us to adapt to their languages, religions, 
celebrations, and cultural peculiarities? Why was it wrong for us but 
right for them? </p>
        <p> There is another shoe-on-the-other-foot argument that 
approaches immigration from a different angle. Ask any white American 
whether he can imagine emigrating to Haiti or Cambodia or India and 
assimilating. Not even the most empty-headed liberal can honestly say he
 can. Why, then, do we expect people from Haiti and Cambodia and India 
to come here and become Americans? If we could never become them, how 
can they become us? At the very least, this question raises the issue of
 cultural and national differences. Americans don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to 
become Haitians or Cambodians or anything Third World because those 
countries are failures. How will people who have built failed societies 
help us build one that works? </p>
        <p> The usual liberal response actually suggests that Americans 
perhaps could become Haitians after all, because it is pure voodoo. The 
theory is that although Americans could never assimilate in India or 
Nigeria, Indians and Nigerians can become good Americans because of <i>American exceptionalism.</i>
 This is some kind of magic, practiced only in America, that suspends 
the laws of human nature and makes all people love each other. The basis
 for this fantasy is that people came from all over Europe, and settled 
in after only a few hiccups. </p>
        <p> You, of course, can point out that this theory completely 
ignores race. Europeans assimilated because they were white, not because
 of some exceptionalist voodoo Jefferson and Madison brewed up. We have 
two sets of non-whites who have been here longer than the Italians and 
the Irish, and they still don&rsquo;t fit in. We have given up expecting our 
own Indians even to live in the same places and under the same rules as 
whites, but we are supposed to think Mixtics and Nahuatls and Bolivians 
in bowler hats are going to make great neighbors and PTA members   &mdash;   
thanks to the voodoo of American exceptionalism. These days, American 
exceptionalism is just a fancy way of saying American whites aren&rsquo;t 
allowed to have a country of their own. </p>

        <p> The multi-cultural propaganda has been so powerful that an 
astonishing number of people think America was founded with the idea of 
making it into a multi-racial paradise, nation of immigrants, and haven 
of diversity. It is always worth pointing out that this is a new-fangled
 notion completely alien to the traditional conception of America. You 
should emphasize that up until the 1960s virtually everyone took it for 
granted that this was a white country (with a few blacks and Indians), 
and that until 1965 we had an immigration policy specifically designed 
to keep the country that way. Explain that you are defending the 
original conception of the country and that your opponent&rsquo;s idea of 
aggressive multi-racialism would have shocked and outraged Washington, 
Jefferson, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Truman, and just about every other 
prominent American up to and including John Kennedy. Explain that you 
are defending the view that prevailed from colonial times until just a 
generation ago, and that your opponent is promoting a revolutionary 
transformation of a country that was working just fine. </p>
        <p> Sometimes people refer to multiculturalism as part of the 
&#8220;American experiment,&#8221; implying that Third-World immigration somehow 
fulfills our destiny. First of all, it is insulting to talk about 
America as an &#8220;experiment,&#8221; as if it were boys having fun with a 
chemistry set, but if the &#8220;American experiment&#8221; ever meant anything, it 
was things like federalism, self government, and manhood suffrage. These
 days, no one who refers to the country as an &#8220;experiment&#8221; can have much
 attachment for it, because experiments are deliberate ventures into the
 unknown that can go horribly wrong. </p>
        <p> Entirely apart from nonsense about &#8220;experiments,&#8221; you can usefully go on the offensive by asking if it is even <i>theoretically </i>possible
 that multi-racialism will not work. Could the country break up into 
ethnic enclaves? Could internal disunity make a coherent foreign policy 
impossible? Could there be race war? Liberals resist admitting even 
theoretical possibilities of this kind, but they cannot rule them out. 
You should ask why we must run even a minimal risk of disaster. We know 
these things don&rsquo;t happen in homogeneous countries; what are we gaining 
from multi-racialism, that comes even close to justifying the risk of 
civil war or Balkanization? This is another question for which there is 
no answer. </p>
        <p> <b>White Hypocrisy</b> </p>
        <p> An entirely different tack to take in a debate about race or
 immigration is to point out the hypocrisy of whites. I like to tell 
radio audiences that almost all whites think as I do, and that I am 
unusual only in speaking publicly   &mdash;   and that I can <i>prove</i> this is 
the way whites think. Actions, I explain, speak louder than words. 
Whites leave when the neighborhood begins to turn black or Mexican. I 
emphasize that this is so predictable there is a name for it: white 
flight. These refugees in their own country may be too browbeaten to 
admit they are leaving because of race, but when they move out of a 
neighborhood that is changing, why do they always go to one that is 
whiter than the one they left? </p>
        <p> &#8220;Can you name a single majority-non-white neighborhood you&rsquo;d
 like to live in?&#8221; I like to ask. &#8220;Or a majority-non-white school you&rsquo;d 
like your children to attend?&#8221; If whites refuse to be minorities at the 
local level, why should they want to be a minority at the national 
level? Why should they want more and more non-whites coming into the 
country, turning ever-vaster areas of it into places in which they would
 refuse to live? </p>
        <p> At this point it is easy to mock William Clinton. While he 
was in office, the Great White Father spoke of the joys of diversity, of
 looking forward to the time when whites become a minority. And where 
did he decide to buy houses after leaving the White House? In Chappaqua,
 New York, which is about as white a place as can be found this side of 
Iceland, and in Georgetown, the whitest part of Washington, DC. </p>
        <p> Senator Edward Kennedy, I like to point out, is just as 
hypocritical. He was an important backer of the 1965 immigration reform 
that threw the country open to Third-Worlders. He is always promoting 
integration, and talks as though living with Mexicans and Guatemalans 
were a wonderful thing. Yet in his own life, he has steered entirely 
clear of the benefits of multi-culturalism. His children went to private
 schools and vacation in Hyannis Port. There aren&rsquo;t likely to be many 
Haitians around when Edward Kennedy goes for a swim. He is therefore a 
great proponent of diversity, but only for people who don&rsquo;t have the 
money for private school and vacations on Martha&rsquo;s Vinyard. You can 
always add that people like him are good examples of the fact that the 
purpose of a liberal education is to give people the right attitude 
towards minorities and the means to live as far away from them as 
possible. </p>

        <p> A similar approach with liberals is to ask them if racial 
integration is an important national objective. They can hardly say 
anything but yes. You can then say, &#8220;In that case, why don&rsquo;t you act on 
your principles and buy a house in a black neighborhood?&#8221; I have never 
heard of even the most deluded white person ever doing this, so you can 
be sure your opponent hasn&rsquo;t done it either. If he then says the reasons
 are not race but crime, bad schools, etc., you have a choice of 
replies: (1) Your opponent won&rsquo;t move into a black neighborhood for 
exactly the same reasons other whites move out of them. It&rsquo;s therefore 
hypocritical for him to criticize white flight or to criticize people 
who want to keep the country white. (2) Crime and bad schools are 
precisely the social ills integration is supposed to cure, so why won&rsquo;t 
your opponent please lead by example? In either case there is no good 
answer. </p>
        <p> In private discussion, you are not likely to be debating a 
black person, but this happens from time to time on radio or television.
 Just as African heads of state commonly believe in juju, many 
middle-class American blacks believe all sorts of preposterous things. 
It is useful to get them to state these things on the air (or before a 
white audience) because it emphasizes the chasm of differences that 
divide the races even after 40 years of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; and &#8220;reaching 
out.&#8221; </p>
        <p> Blacks love to rail about the sins of the white man, and 
even the mildest things you say can set them off. Mention black crime or
 illegitimacy, suggest blacks are responsible for their own failures, 
argue that affirmative action is discrimination against whites, and you 
will get the standard litany. It is entertaining to lead them on: &#8220;Is 
there anything else you can think of whites have done?&#8221; Your opponent 
warms to his task. When you run into a black who clearly hates whites, 
it can be entertaining to ask if anything bad has ever happened to any 
black people anywhere in the world that was not the fault of white 
people. Believe it or not, some blacks will not or cannot answer this 
question. </p>
        <p> When your opponent has finally exhausted his litany of white
 wickedness it is enlightening to ask, &#8220;Do you think whites are a 
uniquely evil people?&#8221; You are likely to get a &#8220;yes.&rsquo; You can follow 
with: &#8220;Can whites be cured, or are they hopelessly evil?&#8221; &#8220;If whites are
 hopeless, shouldn&rsquo;t you be working for complete separation from them 
rather than integration?&#8221; &#8220;Shouldn&rsquo;t whites just be exterminated?&#8221; 
Whites almost never draw blacks out this way, and the answers will 
surprise any whites who are listening. </p>
        <p> A similar approach with blacks is to ask them whether they 
believe specific things most whites think are completely wrong: Does the
 government deliberately supply dope and guns to black neighborhoods so 
blacks will take drugs and kill each other? Did whites invent AIDS as a 
way to get rid of blacks? Before the white man arrived, did African 
blacks have a high level of scientific knowledge? (When you get a &#8220;yes,&rsquo;
 ask for specifics and expect to be regaled with stories of airplanes, 
brain surgery, electricity, communication with other planets, etc.) Were
 Africans the first people to discover America? (Once again, politely 
ask for specifics.) </p>
        <p> Don&rsquo;t even try to rebut the fairy tales you will hear. It 
will have no effect on blacks, whether speaker or audience, and not even
 the goofiest whites believe African princes were flying airplanes or 
discovered America. The point is to encourage blacks to say what they 
really believe about whites and about themselves. Most whites have no 
idea what fantastic things many blacks believe, or how much they hate 
whites. It is exceedingly jarring to them to hear these things 
vigorously expressed by the teachers and community leaders who are 
likely to be your opponents in a public debate. </p>
        <p> Please note that an approach of this kind would not work 
with whites. Even delusionally liberal whites know they shouldn&rsquo;t say 
whites are biologically unique in their evil, and they would never 
suggest they should be exterminated. Even if you could get a white to 
say this sort of thing publicly, other whites will either not believe 
him or dismiss him as a harmless nut. When blacks talk this way, though,
 it is both believable and frightening. </p>
        <p> A surprising number of blacks know about something Andrew Hacker wrote about in his book, <i>Two Nations.</i>
 Prof. Hacker writes that he asked white students how much money they 
would have to be paid in order to go through life as a black person. 
They reportedly said they&rsquo;d have to be paid millions of dollars, and 
blacks say this shows how terrible a disadvantage it is to be black. You
 can then ask, &#8220;If being black is so awful and being white is so great, 
how much would <i>you pay </i>to be white?&#8221; Since you are dealing with a
 white-hater he is likely to reply, &#8220;I wouldn&rsquo;t pay a thing to be white.
 You couldn&rsquo;t pay me enough to be white.&#8221; You can then point out his 
attitude is identical to the one he is criticizing in whites. </p>
        <p> Something to consider when debating blacks is that arguments
 based on arithmetic are likely to mean very little to them. I well 
remember a radio debate with a black about crime, in which I pointed out
 that blacks are more likely than whites to be charged with hate crimes.
 He laughed dismissively and, to my surprise, said he had the FBI hate 
crimes report with him (I was on air by telephone, so could not see the 
others on the program). He triumphantly read out that blacks committed 
only 22 percent of hate crimes, while whites committed more than 60 
percent. After a few minutes of trying to explain that this figure 
proved my point   &mdash;   that 22 percent is greater than the proportion of 
blacks in the population   &mdash;   I gave up. A surprising number of whites have
 trouble understanding any kind of <i>per capita</i> argument; for most blacks, it might as well be quantum theory. </p>
        <p> In any kind of debate there are a number of points to bear 
in mind. The first is never to raise your voice. It may be hard to avoid
 this, because the other side is likely to treat you like a degenerate 
and insult you. This is so unpleasant that many people avoid debates of 
this kind even when they know they are right. Do not return insult for 
insult. The purpose of the debate is not to defend your manhood, but to 
advance calm, reasoned arguments for a point of view many people have 
been taught to think is shocking. When the other side misbehaves or gets
 emotional, your reasonable tone   &mdash;   if you can maintain it   &mdash;   only makes 
you more persuasive. Of course, there are limits beyond which no one 
should have to go. Several times I have had to threaten to end the 
interview if I am not allowed to speak or if the host does not restrain a
 guest who repeatedly insults me. Out of the hundreds of times I have 
been on the air, only twice have I had to say, &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I see 
it&rsquo;s not possible to have a civilized discussion with you,&#8221; and hung up 
the phone. That is a last and desperate resort, because it is important 
and useful to make a case for our side whenever possible, even against 
the heaviest fire and under the most disagreeable circumstances. </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th> &#8220;&#8216;White male&rsquo; is for lab rats and crime suspects. You&rsquo;re a white <i>man</i>.&#8221; </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p> The effort may not seem useful at the time. Particularly if 
you speak before a live audience where questioners must stand up before 
people who know them, you may face what appears to be an unrelieved wall
 of opposition. This is only because so many people on our side are 
frightened and intimidated. Chances are, several people will come up 
furtively afterwards and tell you how pleased they are at what you said.
 I thank them, but I also chide them for their silence. I like to remind
 them that according to our national anthem, this is supposed to be the 
land of the free and the home of the brave. </p>
        <p> Radio programs, to which people can call anonymously, are a 
much better indicator of the level of support for our ideas. If the host
 is a &#8220;conservative,&#8221; it is not uncommon for virtually every caller to 
agree with me. Even when the host is a liberal, and he and most callers 
are hostile, many potential supporters will call the AR office or write 
to us. Over the years, I have noticed that increasing numbers of callers
 know who I am, have read my books or take AR, and call to agree with 
me. </p>
        <p> Even supporters, though, sometimes fall into bad habits that
 reflect our benighted times. Nothing irritates me more than whites 
whose first words are, &#8220;I&rsquo;m a white male, and  &hellip;&#8221; I interrupt them and say, &#8220;&#8216;White male&rsquo; is for lab rats and crime suspects. You&rsquo;re a white <i>man.</i>&#8221;
 I&rsquo;m also sick of whites whose first words are &#8220;I&rsquo;m not racist, but&#8221; and
 who then go on to make some mild, common-sense point about black crime 
or racial double standards. I like to ask them, &#8220;Why&rsquo;d you think you had
 to tell us you aren&rsquo;t a racist?&#8221; Often they don&rsquo;t even remember they 
said that, and the answer   &mdash;   if you get one   &mdash;   is likely to be pitiable 
jabber about how many white people really are &#8220;racist.&#8221; While the caller
 fumbles, I point out that whites are so terrified of being called 
&#8220;racist&#8221; they deny the charge even before they begin to speak, and this 
terror means they are not likely to talk honestly about race. </p>
        <p> To speak honestly often appears to be a lonely task. When 
the immediate response is hostile, it can seem that very little is being
 accomplished, but it is likely that seeds are being planted in people&rsquo;s
 minds that will germinate later. It is vitally important that sensible 
views on race and immigration be broadcast to as large an audience as 
possible. There are now quite a few organizations that consistently 
promote a fair-minded view of what is at stake, and the more they are 
able to do so   &mdash;   and the more effectively they do it   &mdash;   the less lonely 
our work will be.  <img src="../../../../ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11"/> </p>

<p>Just exactly why are you willing to go on national TV and state that it is a scientific fact that Asians are smarter than Whites at a time when thousands of Native Born White American Engineers and Computer Programmers are being race-replaced in the tech professional with Asian legal immigrants and at time when Asians in America are actively participating in the destruction of who knows how many centuries of Native Born White American engineering experience-future Native Born White American experience included that will never be developed. This is in the realm of genocide. I just don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<p>Also, you claim that by stating that science has demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that Asians are more intelligent you undermine the racism charge. However, by doing this, you let the immigration enthusiasts define the terms of the debate-that Whites must prove that they are not racist-which makes it impossible to be expose the very nasty intentions of the immigration enthusiasts-and this includes a rapidly growing population of Asians in America. How come the immigration enthusiasts don&rsquo;t have the burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction of millions of Native Born White Americans that that are not racist?</p>
<p>First rule of debating:make sure that we define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;. My Native Born White American family was greatly harmed by legal Asian immigration..and now my brothers and sisters gotta hear about how Asians in America are intellectually superior to my late Mechanical Engineer Father..it is an insult to his memory.</p>
<p>I write these comments in a spirit of constructive criticism for I have enormous respect for you in your heroic,brave and patriotic battle for our people in a very dangerous time for Native Born White Americans. </p>

		<p>Regarding the immigration act of 1965, I read that supporters argued (and I believe one of them was senator Kennedy) that in no way would this upset the &#8216;racial balance&rsquo; of the country. That hasn&rsquo;t turned out to be true. Similarly, one of the congressional supporters of the civil rights act said that if in any way the legislation led to racial preferences he would &#8216;eat his hat&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve had over 40 years of racial preferences now. </p>
<p>One thing I like to say, when arguments against immigration are called racist, is that this argument, that calling for less immigration is racism, this argument is an admission that immigration itself has a racial component. Arguing against immigration could only  be &#8216;racism&rsquo; if some groups more than others were coming into the country. </p>

<p>Same. I just say &#8220;That word doesn&rsquo;t affect me anymore. It has no meaning,&#8221; and smile. They are usually looking at me blank because I didn&rsquo;t cry and say, &#8220;No, I&rsquo;m not racist but&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I always admired your civility even if I&rsquo;m not convinced on all your arguments. I have respect for opponents regardless of position (I like those who have different ones than mine); however, if there is a lack of intelligent and ill talk, I say otherwise by ripping apart those who fools enough to cross me with sharp harsh wit.</p>

		<p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but when I am unfortunate enough to speak with someone who buys into all this, I just ask &#8220;what&rsquo;s wrong with being white?&#8221; You have all these bad things to say, but it sounds like you wish the whites were non-existent! If that is so, then you are the racist!</p>

		<p>Good points.</p>
<p>Another thing I recommend is to go into public arenas and get a feel for what works. Attend city council meetings. Spend a day touring your local university. Volunteer for a political campaign and walk precincts. March in protest demonstrations with which you might have some interest (for example, Tea Party). See what kinds of arguments sway people. Get into debates and learn from your mistakes  &mdash;  and the other guy&rsquo;s or gal&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too easy to come up with overly intellectual arguments which work for a select audience on the Internet. But you can learn a lot from being out there on the &#8220;streets&#8221; and seeing things close up and real. </p>

		<p>To Jupiter7:  The biggest advantage we should have over our opponents is our commitment to objectivity and the truth.  It is a fact that the same IQ tests that consistently show an average black IQ that is 15 points less than the average white IQ also show that Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese have average IQs about 5 to 7 points higher than that of whites.</p>
<p>That is not an argument for shipping in millions of Asian H-1b workers (who are hired because they&rsquo;re cheaper, not because they&rsquo;re smarter).  After all, even if you can convince Nigerians that whites are smarter than they are, they still wouldn&rsquo;t favor importing so many whites that blacks become a minority in Nigeria.  We created the automobile industry, the semiconductor industry, and put a man on the moon at a time when our scientists and engineers were almost 100% white.  So while north Asians are smart, and can doubtless create successful technological civilizations in their own countries (Japan and South Korea already have, and China is on its way) that is no reason to want to bring in millions more of them here.<br/>

		<p>When debating racial issues stick to facts you can document. When called a racist, don&rsquo;t deny it, but ask, &#8220;What did I say that is not true?&#8221; Point out that it is morally wrong to dislike a person because of his or her race, but hold your ground when maintaining that racial differences extend beyond the cosmetic. </p>

 <br/>
Jared Taylor says Asians on the average are more intelligent than whites because it is true. <br/>
 <br/>
Also, a racist is usually described as someone who believes that his racial group is superior to all the others. By emphasizing the superiority of Orientals and Ashkenazic Jews Jared Taylor demonstrates that he is not a &#8220;racist&#8221; by common definition. </p>

<p>The words racism and racist are used as weapons against whites.  Use of these slanders is effective and become more effective with use.</p>
<p>Well, we have words we can use against them.  Refer to their genocidism and call them genocidists.  </p>
<p>Rather than continuing to absorb abuse start calling them genocidists at every opportunity.  </p>
<p>This type of policy works for the anti-white racists.  It will work for those who defend the white race. </p>

		<p>Whites who accuse others of being racist are usually whites who have known few blacks in their personal lives. These blacks have been exceptional, or they have occupied subordinate positions without resentment.<br/>
 <br/>
Whites whose lives require them to interact with large numbers of blacks on terms of approximate equality know how dangerous blacks can be. Those whites are the natural audience for the messages of American Renaissance. They will not care if those messages are &#8220;racist.&#8221; The messages will resonate with what they know from experience.<br/>

		<p>#2 Jupiter:<br/>
Keep in mind that this article was written over a decade ago.  Since then, IQ studies have emerged that place some European ethnicities above 104 (google EU IQ)  <br/>
One very important point made here by Mr. Taylor is that white people, in mainstream discussion, usually rely on the premise that what is good for whites or blacks or browns should be good for everyone.  Whites want to apply fairness and equality across the board, where many, if not most, non-white groups are interested only in fairness and equality (not to mention gain) for their own group.  And, in this regard, both Mr. Tayor and Jupiter make an excellent and pertinent point  &mdash;  white people must look out for themselves before considering any other ethnicity.  NO ONE ELSE WILL.  In this regard, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where we stand as to IQ.  And, fortunately, this sentiment is growing among whites.  </p>

		<p>I agree with most of what Taylor says, but there was one point that was not correct. He seems to have repeated the commonly-held wrong idea which is that most whites are blind to what is going on, and willfully complicit in their dispossession. This is simply not true. One sees evidence for that time and again, when polls are taken even by MSM groups with leftist leanings, they still conclude that for many of these left wing ideas, affirmative action, amnesty for illegals, furloughs and voting rights for prisoners, etc, that time and again majorities of the population (around 60-80+ %) disagree with these ideas, but they get carried out by legislators, judical activists, presidents, etc anyway. It is true that most whites are being lied to by the MSM, the schools, etc, so only have limited knowledge of just how much they are being discriminated against, but with what they do see and know, they are still concluding they are being discriminated against, and that these Marxist-driven racial preferences are wrong.  Some of the main problems I see are 1) that the elected officials are not performing their roles of doing the will of the people, and the judiciary are not being impartial arbitrators of the law. 2) That media, schools, etc have created the impression that most people in the US agree with left wing ideology when in fact, far more are either right wing or neutral; 3) hate laws, media, schools etc have created a situation where many people feel they must publicly put on airs of agreeing with the left (or be silent) for fear of persecution, of losing their jobs, of facing criminal charges, lawsuits, etc. </p>
<p>The fact is most whites do see what is going on and feel they are being treated unfairly, and will even admit it, when they are allowed to do so anonymously in blind poll or at the voting booth. I think if we can make progress standing against points #2, and #3 above (such as in the excellent example of raising a voice at the White Privilege summit that Taylor lists in another recent article), then we can make a major step in turning this thing around. You should think of this as good news- the people and votes and knowledge that they are being treated unjustly are there, it is just removing the tape over the mouth and the spectre of Big Brother, and all the rest will fall in place.</p>

		<p>I want to follow up on the race-IQ issue. James Fulford has stated in both of his responses in the letters section of vdare.com, that vdare.com will keep focusing on the race-IQ issue. Here is my question:why is this relevant in anyway to the most fundamental issue facing Native Born White Americans which is race-replacement? I am still waitng for  a compelling argument&hellip;I promise to keep an open mind. In the meantime..suppose we just assume that the Mexicans-every sigle one of them had an IQ of 200&hellip;does the case against race-replacement become any weaker? Not by one bit.</p>
<p>It seems obvious that to engage in microscopic genetic analysis of racial-differenes in IQ has 0 to do witht the race-replacement issue. However, on two occassions, I have seen debates that should have stayed unrelentingly focused on the race-replacment issue sidetracked becaue someone raised the race-IQ issue..on one occasion it was an immigration enthusiast making the case for Asian legal immgration because&hellip;Asians have higher IQs then Whites.  This is where Fulford&rsquo;s full-speed ahead with race-IQ will aways lead. </p>
<p>The alternative to microscopic-genetic analysis of the race-IQ issue is tribal-genetic racialism&hellip;.this people understand in their guts.</p>
<p>For the life of me, I can not figure out why anyone concerned about the race-replacement issue would have any interest in the IQ differences between black NBA point guards and black NBA forwards? But this is what you get on the flagship website on immigration reform-vdare.com. Am I missing something? Am not trying to mean about this.</p>
<p>To anticipate the counterargument  I see comming&hellip;we shouldn&rsquo;t give a hoot if blacks and hispanics call us a racists because we don&rsquo;t want to be taxed to death to subsidize their geneline&hellip;let them riot..we will deal with it&hellip;deportation for Mexicans and Salvadorans&hellip;separation from blacks&hellip;racial genetic tribalism in its full glory&hellip;no need to worry about  the mind-numbing details of a psychometric study </p>

		<p>Jupiter 7: As usual, you and I (and plenty of others on here), are pretty much on the same page on this topic.  I agree that facts are facts, when it comes to IQ tests.  However, I will say that the Asian IQ argument is becoming more and more irrelevant.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that while it is scientifically proven that Asians score higher to some degree on tests, the fact of the matter is that whites have invented and created so much more, which is historically proven on many accounts.  I have even heard Jared Taylor answer a question at an Amren conference I attended in which he suggested that whites may have a wider spread to their IQ, which makes them have more individuals who are willing to take risks and chances. It could also mean whites have more geniuses while the overall averages aren&rsquo;t as high as those for Asians.</p>
<p>I have read Rushton&rsquo;s work extensively, and I am sure Jupiter7 has too.  I don&rsquo;t see anything wrong with questioning how the IQ tests are structured, and I am most certainly not alone on that.  Perhaps if they were tilted to other types of talents (measuring other parts of the brain), whites would have the higher IQs.</p>
<p>But then again, that is just a suggestion on my part.  It is an inquiry.  It is what educated people do. </p>
<p>For now, I am willing to accept that North East Asians have higher IQs, but I agree with Jupiter7 that this atrribute of their&rsquo;s is becoming less and less relevant in our arguments, which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>We are always presented with stories on here about &#8220;the model minority&#8221; whining about something that &#8220;isn&rsquo;t fair&#8221; in the same way other minorities do, even if it doesn&rsquo;t happen nearly as often, but it still happens.  The most recent example of this is the Alexandra Wallace story.  If Asians really are a model minority, then why do they make a big deal over a Youtube video like that?  As I said before, why are white people the only ones with thick skin (or at least who are expected to have thick skin)?</p>
<p>Please think about that really hard.  Usually the more capable you are, the more you are expected to &#8220;have thick skin&#8221; when you are criticized for something.</p>
<p>On a side note, and I know that most people already do this on here, it is crucial that we distinguish between Northeast Asians and the rest of Asians, particularly Indians.  India overall has a low IQ, and yes, we are getting the cream of the crop from the country.  However, I and others on here have worked with these &#8220;smart, cream of the crop&#8221; Indians, and they really aren&rsquo;t that &#8220;smart&#8221;.</p>
<p><br/>
In closing I would like to say that everyone is entitled to their own arguments just as long as they don&rsquo;t personally insult people.  I may make strong arguments on here that irritate SOME people, but unlike some of my recent attackers who come on here and claim they are &#8220;civil&#8221;, I don&rsquo;t resort to personal attacks. And for every person who doesn&rsquo;t seem to like me I have two that do, it is just that they aren&rsquo;t as vocal.  They instead send me personal emails of encouragement for speaking the truth. </p>
<p>For future reference, please argue with what I say and tell me what is wrong with it all you want.  But don&rsquo;t go into what you don&rsquo;t like about me as a poster. That is against the posting guidelines.  As I said before, my opinions may sound strong and mean and I may jump to conlusions, but I don&rsquo;t personally attack people.  At least, I try not to.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that when a white person comes on here and gives the Chinese or Japanese credit for a white invention, I am going to get pretty irritated, just like I do with the leftists who come on  here. I get irritated when someone doesn&rsquo;t do their research properly.  And it has happened far too often.  White people need to be aware of their accomplishments, and some above would say I am being &#8220;arrogant&#8221; or &#8220;racist&#8221; for that which I think is foolish. I am simply stating facts. It is time for whites to get serious about this stuff.</p>
<p>I have been posting on here since 2004 and I have attended one of the conferences.  I have shaken Jared Taylor&rsquo;s hand.  I am very young still and still have a future ahead of me which will involve getting married and having white babies, and fulfilling my roll as a white wife.  I am by no means a threat to this movement.  I won&rsquo;t be leaving any time soon, as much as a minority on here want me to. Have a nice day, Jupiter, and keep it up.</p>

		<p>Some of the responses of my comrades here confirm my fears about using race-IQ as a tactic.</p>
<p>A few years back I attended a public debate on immigration. One of the immigration enthusiasts on the panel made the case for increasing Asian legal immigration because-he claimed-sientific studies show convincingly that Asians are smarter than White Americans and that we need to import Asian engineers because Asian engineers are smarter than White American engineers. He stated it just this way. And after he confidently asserted these scientific facts, a Native Born White American Engineer-he identified himself as an Italian American-rose from his seat with viens popping out of his neck-I honestly thought this guy was going to have a heart attack-in a very agitated state and  told this White Liberal immigration enthusiast that what he had just stated was a lie and that Asian engineers were in fact not more intelligent than White Amertican Engineers.</p>
<p>You see what I am getting at folks? James Fulford wrote today that vdare.com will continue pursuing its interest in race-IQ psychometric data. I come across very angry Native Born White American engineers all the time. And the profanity laced language they use to express their contempt for Indian and Chinese legal immigrant engineer scab workers would never be allowed on American Renaissance and vdare.com. Here is my question:Why should I send them over to vdare.com? At least on American Renaissance they can come on and take a dissenting point of view on Asian intelligence.</p>
<p>Raising the race and IQ issue will always sidetrack away from the much more fundamental issue of race-replacement&hellip;this is my central point. We do not need the the science of IQ test scores to justify our racial-genetic tribal preferences.</p>

		<p>Post #13 is correct.  For most of my life, whites wouldn&rsquo;t talk about race at all, or they&rsquo;d whisper, &#8220;Well, I&rsquo;m not a racist, mind you, but we moved because our daughter was being beaten up by&hellip;&#8221;  (even lower whisper) &#8220;colored people!!&#8221;  They&rsquo;d look around furtively before saying it, almost as if a bolt of lightning was going to come down on them.  That&rsquo;s how whites talked about race, in fearful, apologetic whispers.  But in recent years, they&rsquo;re waking up.  More and more, they are speaking out.  They see white males unable to get work because of affirmative action.  They see Latino illegals protesting by the thousands in our streets.  They see commercials where whites are portrayed as clumsy doofuses who cannot get by without wise advice from a nonwhite.  Etc., etc.  With all that is happening now, and with it being SO obvious and blatant, even the most clueless whites are awakening.  I see this as a great sign, but&hellip;is it too late?</p>

		<p>I think that being realistic about white IQs is just as important as being realistic about black ones for the simple reasons that:</p>
<p>1.  If you won&rsquo;t engage in &#8216;genetic algorithm&rsquo; (Darwinian) delineation of who is better and more deserving of a given slice-cut of the economic pie, you have to accept that living with a group you -don&rsquo;t- like is about accommodation, from both sides.  If you also won&rsquo;t risk miscegenation, you have to further conclude that maybe a smarter black/hispanic population is -statistically- going to be more socially coherent and, in particular, able to raise a higher percentage of educated blacks that can self-support an internalized society (2.5% of blacks with 115IQ or higher &#8216;useful for college&rsquo; from a 36 million base = 900,000).</p>
<p>2.  There are so many differences between brains, individually, that I find it hard to believe that (as with diseases) there are not additional ones, &#8216;native to continents&rsquo;.  In particular, I have heard, privately, that blacks have less well developed function in the prefrontals and less coherent or controlled &#8216;cross talk&rsquo; through the Corpus Callosum between the hemispheres.  If we can measure that, statistically, via PET scan, MRI and the like, it&rsquo;s another arrow in our quiver.</p>
<p>3.  If we are honest about how we are lagging the planet, due to failures in education and depletion of resources, both social and economic, we can start to take &#8216;appropriate measures&rsquo; to _improve our competitiveness_.  Because you can be sure the Chinese, with an established Eugenics and GE program, are out to do so.  We don&rsquo;t have millenia to rise to the level of the Parsi or higher Ashkenazi the old fashioned way, and technology makes it possible to avoid the means (inbreeding) they have resorted to to fix the trait of intelligence.</p>
<p>I personally think that Africa is a mouse-eats-elephant opportunity, the same way the PRC is to Taiwan.  Whites can&rsquo;t do that because that would be &#8216;colonialist/racist/imperialist&rsquo; but if you want blacks out of your country, then the reality is that you had better make them competitive enough to become dominant, someplace else.  And Africa is still rich enough, naturally as well as primitive, socially, that there is a real chance for &#8216;the right skin color&rsquo; to dominate and unify an average 67IQ Continent.</p>
<p>Mexico is another issue.  It looks to me like the white minority rule there -should- go.  And Mestizo rule replace it.  Maybe if they had a country of their own&hellip;  In any case, maintaining privilege to the exclusion of cultural equity or stewardship is a large part of what is wrong with the drug wars right now.  Nobody can make killing the druglords &#8216;any way you can&rsquo; a political rallying point for browns as the majority element of the racial continuum that forms their caste driven society. </p>
<p>In any case, whatever your belief on separation (pragmatic) vs. expulsion (dream on) beliefs here, IQ should not be abandoned as a means to justify preferential association.  Because IQ -makes societies worthwhile- and people will go where they think the good life is.  They will also stay loyal.  Which means if you create a community school system that -massively- leverages white educational norms, you will get children that remember who got them that 40-60-80 grande starting position instead of a clerkship at 7-11.  The economics of intelligence _count_ when a .73 association between IQ and job satisfaction is accounted for.</p>
<p>Again, IQ is just another arrow.  Don&rsquo;t forget it&rsquo;s there.  Don&rsquo;t abuse it.  The heart of the shot is the aimpoint you hold in your heart when you lose.</p>

		<p><i>When debating racial issues stick to facts you can document. When called a racist, don&rsquo;t deny it, but ask, &ldquo;What did I say that is not true?&rdquo; </i></p>
<p>Good point. One thing that is useful is to take a few solid stats, and then repeat them until they are widely accepted. This is something that race realists have done successfully on the Internet: race is a matter of genes not skin color; IQ differences as genetic; violent crime rates among the races reflect genetic issues; the system discriminates against Whites. </p>
<p>This approach is useful since it gives those who are potential race realists ammunition to back up their arguments. It can also win over people who are sitting on the fence. </p>
<p>Keep it simple. Avoid conspiracy theory type arguments. Even if correct, they tend to alienate too many people. </p>
<p>Also, take a stealth approach by opposing illegal immigration, affirmative action, and the welfare state.  Granted, these deal with symptoms, not causes, but they are a way to edge in on the debate. </p>
<p>As for being called a &#8220;racist,&#8221; take the Objectivist approach and insist that the other side define the term, then ask them to explain where your argument fits in to it. At this point, most multicultists will self destruct. </p>
<p>Something I have seen used very successfully is going on the offensive and attacking liberalism by pointing out that America has had over two generations of every liberal program on civil rights, yet we have growing pathologies among the underclass:  crime, welfare dependency, collapse of education, inter-racial violence, etc. Point out that this is all the result of liberal policies. Force liberals onto the defensive, and discredit liberalism. This approach is also useful on occasion for winning over some of the more intelligent among minorities. </p>
<p>Above all, keep using the Internet to disseminate information and maintain mutual support. </p>

		<p>On Youtube there is an old video of Jared Taylor appearing on the Phil Donahue show. Phil Donahue accused Jared of all sorts of wickedness, and to &#8220;prove&#8221; his point he read what purported to be Jared&rsquo;s own words in which Jared supposedly referred to &#8220;ugly Mexicans&#8221; and &#8220;ugly Haitians.&#8221;  Jared responded by saying that it just didn&rsquo;t sound like anything he would write.  </p>
<p>I now know the source for Donahue&rsquo;s charge. </p>
<p>Years ago, we used to hear the expression &ldquo;ugly American.&rdquo; It meant Americans who went to other countries and expected the people to speak English, who wanted to find American food, and who generally expected foreign countries to act American. This, of course, was universally condemned. Why, then, do we invite foreigners in the United States to act like &ldquo;ugly Mexicans&rdquo; and &ldquo;ugly Haitians&rdquo; who expect us to adapt to their languages, religions, celebrations, and cultural peculiarities? Why was it wrong for us but right for them? </p>
<p>As we can see, the terms are in quotes and juxtaposed with the well known but apparently noncontroversial term &#8220;ugly American.&#8221; Donahue dishonestly wrenched Jared&rsquo;s words completely out of context. </p>

<p>&#8220;Jared Taylor</p>
<p>&#8220;Just exactly why are you willing to go on national TV and state that it is a scientific fact that Asians are smarter than Whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>JE: &#8220;Jared Taylor says Asians on the average are more intelligent than whites because it is true.&#8221;</p>
<p>q: That is not a true statement either.  In fact it is false.</p>
<p>The fact is SOME Asians&hellip;as a group&hellip;score on average of about 3 points higher than whites&hellip;.as a group&hellip;. on I.Q. tests,  (Murray and Hernstein, The Bell Curve.) </p>
<p>Overview of the Bell Curve studies:</p>
<p>&#8220;A brief narrative description of the journal article, document, or resource. This paper reviews the book &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; by Harvard psychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Alan Murray. The paper asserts as the book&rsquo;s main points and implications: (1) one&rsquo;s socioeconomic place in life is now determined by IQ rather than family wealth and influence; (2) ruling white elites, who have benefited from better homes, books, conversation, and education, pass these advantages along to their children; (3) white high IQ rich are getting richer but having fewer children than the lower IQ majority and will be swamped by them; (4) East Asian Americans have, on average, 3 points higher IQ than whites who average 15 points higher IQ than African-Americans;&#8221;  </p>
<p>Too, whites&hellip;.generally&hellip;. score much higher on verbal portions of I.Q. tests than East Asians, and East Asians&hellip;generally&hellip;score higher on the math portions.  Should that be mentioned?  </p>
<p>What irks me is to read statements by whites who are so anxious to agree &#8220;ASIANS&#8221; are more intelligent than whites, without qualifying the information any further, because they&rsquo;re too eager to want to sound &#8220;FAIR.&#8221;  It&rsquo;s preposterous to make an accurate general statement about Asians, when there are Asians, like Indians, who score 81&hellip;as a group&hellip;on I.Q. tests, as well as other groups in Asia.</p>
<p>Sorry, but I&rsquo;ve been I.Q. tested twice in my life at 136 and 141, respectively, and I&rsquo;m not about to agree that Asians with group avcerage I.Q.&rsquo;s of 103 to perhaps 105 are more intelligent than I am.  If it sounds egotistical, that&rsquo;s too bad, but that&rsquo;s the brutal truth as to the way I feel about the matter.</p>
<p>Also, do any white people on here understand that a mere 3 points on an I.Q. test, as a group average, really needs to be elaborated on as if the differnce is as huge as the white black difference of 15 to 18 points?  The fact is the difference is not much at all.</p>
<p>East Asians in this country DO display a good scholastic grade average as a group, but it can be directly attributed to the fact that they DO have better study habits and most certainly DO try harder than the average white.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just stop and analyze all these self-denigration generalities about how &#8220;Asians&#8221; are more intelligent than whites as if it were ALL Asians versus ALL whites, when that premise is incorrect, and any difference that might exist is almost inconsequential.  </p>
<p>Consider that white societies have been so much more successful than Asian ones for centuries, responsible for infinitely more scientific advancements and inventions, there is more at play than what an I.Q. test reveals. That too is more than obvious to people who can understand the concept.  I.Q. tests are good, but they are not complete enough to tell the entire story. More work needs to be done.</p>
<p>For example, take the Indian group average I.Q. of 81 compared to the group average I.Q. of blacks at 85.  Why has India completely outdistanced Africa in every possible aspect of civilization and the advancement of societies, including religion and culture, if they truly aren&rsquo;t a more intelligent people. Yes, 81 is still better than the African average of 70, but Indians outperform American blacks in their societies in India today, rapidly advancing their country far more than the disgraceful failures evident in all black run governments here in this country.  </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take another turn here, does anybody on here want to consider why the mestizo group I.Q. is 4 points higher than American blacks, and when they refer to the situation do they want to phrase it in terms that refer to the greater intelligence of mestizos over blacks?  I never hear that or read of it.  </p>
<p>Why the rush toward white self-denigration?</p>

		<p>I think one of the BEST racial arguments is that Indian immigrants have skins darker than blacks but are more succesful than whites on the average. Don&rsquo;t Blacks define race as the &#8220;color of their skin&#8221;? If they say they are being discriminated against based on their color, why do we Indians succeed? Also they claim that schools should teach Black history to make Blacks successful. Our Indian kids go to school here learning NOTHING about India and even hear the word &#8220;Indian&#8221; refering to the Native American Indian instead of their own people. According to multiculturalist liberals, this should cause them to &#8220;not do well because the curriculum doesn&rsquo;t even show their people&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, the children of Indian immigrants have THE HIGHEST TEST SCORES of ANY ethnic group. Jared Taylor asks AR readers to &#8220;name one minority non-white neighborhood they are willing to live in&#8221;. I say whites here in Cupertino, CA paying $1,000,000 for a 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house to live in a neighborhood that&rsquo;s 70 percent Asian so their kids can to to school with all the smart Chinese and Indian kids. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always considered name-calling as the verbal equivalent to bringing a knife to a fist-fight. I guess it&rsquo;s possible to block (defend) every slash but ultimately if you&rsquo;re going to win the fight, you need to isolate the weapon, get rid of it and attack with overwhelming force.</p>
<p>It takes no energy whatsoever to casually toss the word &#8220;racist&#8221; at an opponent. The name-caller has seen it all before so he can sit back and file his nails while the &#8220;The &ldquo;racist&rdquo; apologizes, back-peddles, and shrivels into silence.&#8221; as Mr. Taylor says.<br/>
Defense.</p>
<p>But what if the verbal &#8220;knife&#8221; was met with a verbal &#8220;katana&#8221;? What if the &#8220;racist&#8221; (upon being called a racist) immediately turned it around on the name-caller calling HIM the racist - only turning up the volume and mock anger? Imagine the startled name-caller; certainly THIS hasn&rsquo;t happened before! While the name-caller is stunned into silence (and the racist has everyone&rsquo;s undivided attention) the racist can announce to everyone within earshot that the name-caller is attempting to frame the debate to his/her best advantage and is, in effect, demonstrating his racism.</p>
<p>What does everyone think of this strategy? I&rsquo;ve always wondered about this and, while Mr. Taylor is such a smooth dude, not all of us are as polished and need workable solutions in-field.<br/>
Looking forward to the replies on this!</p>

		<p>No problem knowing the difference between white and black in South Africa. But the propaganda bugle is hard at work to change that perception, especially for our youth, but it won&rsquo;t be successful in a society that is rampant with anti-white discrimination and violence against the whites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Asians may have higher IQ&rsquo;s BUT the spirit of innovation resides primarily with the white euro-American races. Asians are expert at improving systems that white people invented.&#8221;</p>
<p>- I wouldn&rsquo;t say they are even experts at that. They are simply cheaper labor than the west.</p>

		<p>I am reading most of the comments under this article and 90% if not more of the posters seem to be saying things about Asians that are almost identical (if not identical) to what I say all the time about Asians on here. Yet, your comments get unanswered by antagonists on here, meanwhile whenever I open my mouth on the Asian issue, it is a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the leftists, antagonists, trouble makers, and Asian lovers on here just love singling out me perhaps because I am a woman.  I get a lot of abuse on this website for my views on Asians which really aren&rsquo;t any different from what most other posters on here believe themselves, and the comments under this article are a fine example of that.</p>
<p>I for one, am NOT ever backing down when it comes to my views on Asians, because what I say is the truth.  The fact of the matter is that whites have created more impressive civilizations and we have invented more.  This should be obvious.  Whenever I mention this on here I am serenaded with insults about how I am closeminded and arrogant.  </p>
<p>I am also presented with examples of China&rsquo;s wonderful ancient civilization or all the wonderful things Japan is currently doing.  These people who present me with this stuff are missing the point.  None of these examples prove that Asians have developed or created as much of whites.</p>
<p>As someone else mentioned above&hellip;&hellip;why are there so many self-hating whites in this movement?</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that some on here have also married an Asian and of course they always seem to defend their nonwhite spouse and their race for some odd reason. They never defend White interests against their nonwhite spouses racial interests. This is a BIG problem when marrying outside of one&rsquo;s race. How many Whites do you know who do marry outside their race defend their own groups racial interests over their spouses racial interests?  And, I might add, that it is ONLY the WHITE spouse that defends the other race, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>WR the Elder (poster #7), you are correct. However, Asians, as a group, are not creative. They can do mathematical calculations (invented by whites) as a group better than most white people can, they can engage in precision manufacturing (which white people invented) better than the average white person. They are better at learning science and medicine, but they cannot invent these things. They are better at imitation if shown first. It is good, however, that they do have the proficiency that they do and they should be commended for it.</p>

		<p>#19, Your point is very important to me. When we have something to donate, rather than take it to the Salvation Army, find like minded persons in your church or community to donate to. Say&hellip;baby clothes or a gift card to baby&rsquo;s R-Us for a young white couple with a new born. If you know a white family unable to move from a non-white neighborhood, organize your church to assist them in finding a better residence. Educate friends and family about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse.  Methamphetamines are really taking a toll on rural white youths. During these tough economic and racially charged times, efforts like these and others can help a white family stay strong and healthy. #19 and I are mostly off the mark of this discussion. I have not debated those opposed to my view because it has seemed a waste of time and energy, although I &#8216;m sure there is benefit in some situations. My experience has shown me that people seem more attentive and receptive if you come with gifts. Remember, a cold drink on a hot day opens a lot of peoples ears. </p>

		<p>Rajesh&rsquo;s post shows how  easily the IQ and race focus in the context of debating immigration can 1)sidetrack away from the fundamental issue of race-replacing the Native Born White Majority and 2)leads to an economic and genetic case for race-replacing Native Born White Americans in states such as California with a rapidy growing hostile Asian population.</p>
<p>In a public &#8220;debate&#8221;, Jared Taylor must state emphatically 1)there is no economic,demographic,cultural and environmental-ecological case against race-replacing the Native Born White Majority with high fertility-post-1965 nonwhites. Then he must ask the target Native Born White American audience the following question:what are you willing to give up for racial minority status? This is how every &#8220;debate&#8221; should be framed form the start.</p>
<p>Always keep the following fundamental fact in mind when &#8220;debating&#8221; immigration:the intent of post-1965 immigration policy,the intent of White Liberal immigration enthusiasts and the intent of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites is to race-replace the Native Born White American Majority, street by street,town by town, county by county and state by state. And as the incident at USC involving a Native Born White American female teenager demonstrates&hellip;.the Asians are very serious and nasty about race-replacing Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>White flight exists because whites do not want to live around people who have extremely high incidents of crime and violence and who are rude, crude, loud and yes, quite frankly, stupid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lets talk about our own problems and building our own racial consciousness rather than going on about &lsquo;Asians act like this&rsquo;, &lsquo;Blacks act like that&rsquo;. &#8220;</p>

<p>Anybody who believes blacks and Hispanics and SOME other races are not &#8220;in-your-face&#8221; is just plain ignorant.  Rabid anti-white talk and attitudes fill the airwaves and t.v. screens. A 12 year old child can recognize it. And that fact says a lot about those who can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re good at being racist. If whites are so great, why can&rsquo;t we get good at it as well?&#8221;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re very good at it, then somebody jumps up and starts screaming hysterically about being too aggressive when he should stop contributing, because the subject matter is obviously too difficult for him to understand.</p>
<p>Many of these same kinds of people pretend to be WN&rsquo;s and get on the site gullibly thinking they&rsquo;re going to change minds here, when they&rsquo;re very easy to spot, but, most of all, what they say is so illogical and filled with so many contradictions only a fool is taken in by them. </p>

<p>Wrong!  The Chinese group average is 100.  (Lynn, I.Q. and Wealth of Nations)</p>
<p>If you&#8221;re going to cherry pick Asians using only Korea and Japan, then to make a logical, accurate comparison you have to use other white nations/ethnicities individually as well, like group average I.Q.&rsquo;s for Germany, Finland and Italy with I.Q.&rsquo;s of 102.</p>
<p>By lumping all &#8220;Asians&#8221; together, the group average is going to be in the nineties someplace.</p>
<p>Althoug I.Q. is a very important indicator of intelligence, it is NOT the ONLY indicator, which is quite obvious since white nations of the world have outdistanced the rest of humanity by a considerable amount.</p>
<p>This is important in trying to accurately come up with reasons why one race of people does so much better than another, although the I.Q. averages are about the same or only a couple points different.</p>
<p>As the poster above states, does anybody think that US blacks with a group I.Q. average of 85 are more intelligent than Indians whose group I.Q. has been determined to be 81?  If you do, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I&rsquo;d like to sell you.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s worth reading any of the books and internet sites out there on public relations, advertising, information operations, and agitprop. </p>
<p>One thing the left is good at is using public media as a means to approach wider audiences. If they get on TV, they are not simply debating the moderator. They are exploiting the camera time to reach millions of people. This gives them a chance to push their ideas on the wider world.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is that you have several different target audiences. There is the person you are debating with. You will rarely win them over. But you can use debates as a means to approach and win the fence sitters. This is often done by stating the facts in a logical and simple way. You have to keep it simple in order to get the average person to understand what you are saying. And you have to repeat your points.</p>
<p>There is also &#8220;preaching to the choir.&#8221; You have to give people on your own side the intellectual ammunition to sustain their arguments. And show them that they are not alone. </p>
<p>Another thing is to ignore the other side&rsquo;s provocations and smears, and simply keep on pushing your own ideas in a reasonable manner. Thus, one might respond to the tossing about of the word &#8220;racism&#8221; by saying, &#8220;You can not make a rational argument so you must resort to name calling.&#8221; Then continue on in a logical fashion.</p>
<p>Having said all that, there is a place for emotion in arguments, depending on the audience. Appeals to patriotism will work with many people. Go on the offensive and demonstrate how the opposition is supporting open borders, outsourcing of jobs, and so forth. Accuse them of &#8220;treason&#8221; (we can do name calling, also!).</p>
<p>Above all, get yourself educated about the facts supporting your own side, and the tactics of effective PR or agitprop or whatever. </p>

		<p>For some reason (please explain!) nobody here wants to look at the origin of the term &#8220;racist&#8221; which is extremely important!</p>
<p>The world is not very old. (Can you find it over a century ago?)</p>
<p>Leon Trotsky coined it in print in his 1930 (extremist) &#8220;History of the Russian Revolution&#8221; where he used it as a propaganda slur to silence a group that largely rejected his Marxist plans - the slavi people who loved their own ways and people, not him. He ranted against them and called the Slavophiles &#8220;rasistov&#8221; which gets into English as &#8220;racist.&#8221; Later he also ranted against National Socialism and attacked Germans as &#8220;racist.&#8221; And after his exile, while in Mexico, he hatched a plan for MArxist revolt in USA, and decided to rile up blacks and other non-whites to hurl the epithet &#8220;racist&#8221; at us&hellip; as if we should shudder in fear and be silent. </p>
<p>So, folks hurling this term are really neo-Trotskyites, even if they don&rsquo;t realize it. Tell them! And tell them he was just a deceptive and murderous schemer, full of lies and propaganda. After all he killed lots of us while a top Marxist Russian official, and he plotted destruction of USA! He took money and guns from top western bankers to back the &#8220;red&#8221; revolution that was ostensibly against capitalists. Clearly the whole thing was just a plot to divide and conquer us. Such toxic deception is the hidden root of the epithet &#8220;racist.&#8221; </p>
<p>Clearly the ravings of this vile conspirator/killer are not to scare us. So outrightly REPUDIATE USE OF THE TROTSKY TERM RACIST.</p>

<p>If you&rdquo;re going to cherry pick Asians using only Korea and Japan, then to make a logical, accurate comparison you have to use other white nations/ethnicities individually as well, like group average I.Q.&rsquo;s for Germany, Finland and Italy with I.Q.&rsquo;s of 102.</p>
<p>By lumping all &ldquo;Asians&rdquo; together, the group average is going to be in the nineties someplace.</p>
<p>Althoug I.Q. is a very important indicator of intelligence, it is NOT the ONLY indicator, which is quite obvious since white nations of the world have outdistanced the rest of humanity by a considerable amount.</p>
<p>This is important in trying to accurately come up with reasons why one race of people does so much better than another, although the I.Q. averages are about the same or only a couple points different.</p>
<p>As the poster above states, does anybody think that US blacks with a group I.Q. average of 85 are more intelligent than Indians whose group I.Q. has been determined to be 81? If you do, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I&rsquo;d like to sell you.</p>

<p>Alexander:</p>
<p>I will agree with you about the fact, that while we as Whites should be proud of our accomplishments, the fact is that we(in my opinion)spend FAR TOO MUCH TIME in debating and discussing IQ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As you so aptly mentioned in your post, high IQ&rsquo;s have not prohibited Whites from engaging in behaviors that have been foolishly detrimental to us as a race. </p>
<p>Moreover, many people with extremely high IQ&rsquo;s tend to be somewhat dysfunctonal and socially awkward. Case in point, I have two relatives whose IQs are over 140. Both are mentally unbalanced to a certain degree. One was addicted to drugs for  time period. The other lived with me for a year after the breakup of his third marriage at age 38!  Both have trouble making even small conversation with average people and have never been able to work in a company for any length of time.</p>
<p>On the contrary, my most successful relatives have IQ&rsquo;s in the range of 105-120. These are the businesssmen, attorneys etc&hellip; My IQ is 117. I have done quite well for myself. I would argue that if you were to go into a meeting or found out who the boss or CEO of a corporation is, the fact is that it would not be the person with the highest IQ. In fact, the odds are it would be the person with an average or the lowest IQ.</p>
<p>I am not saying that we as Whites should dismiss the value of IQ&rsquo;s, but I do believe that there a number of Amerenes who get are too preoccuopied with debating and discussing this topic at the expense of ignoring more important, pressing isssues such as immigration, economic redistribution of wealth, the White elite that has all but sold us ordinary Whites down the river etc&hellip;</p>
<p>These are the issues that we should be more adamant in tackling.</p>
