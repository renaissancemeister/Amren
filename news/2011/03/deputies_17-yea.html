<h1>Deputies: 17-Year-Old Girl Assaults Mother with Gun to Get New Vehicle</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dennis Culver, News Press, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 17-year-old girl was charged Friday with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful possession of a firearm and battery after deputies say she pulled a gun on her mother during an argument.</p>
<p>Rachel Anne Hachero was upset because her mother wouldn&rsquo;t co-sign on a vehicle purchase, according to a Lee County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office report.</p>
<p>The teen&rsquo;s mother told investigators Hachero threatened to kill her when she refused to co-sign for the vehicle.</p>
<p>Hachero then confronted her mother at home with a gun and pistol-whipped her head, according to the report.</p>
<p>After pistol-whipping her mother, Hachero pointed the gun at her mother&rsquo;s head and stomach and told her she was going with her to sign for the car, according to the report.</p>
<p>The mother told investigators Hachero ordered her mother into the vehicle and demanded she drive to the dealership to sign for the car or she would shoot her.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The mother told investigators she went through Hachero&rsquo;s purse Friday while Hachero was at school and located the gun, drugs and drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p>The mother told investigators she did not want to press charges against Hachero, because she had recently been accepted to several Ivy League colleges.</p>
<p>Deputies decided to charge Hachero due to the nature of the incident.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;she had recently been accepted to several Ivy League colleges.&#8221;</p>
<p>And why had she been accepted to several Ivy League colleges?  Was it because of her high intelligence, outstanding SAT scores, and high moral character?  Or was it because of the color of her skin?</p>
<p>Also, remember this: for every undeserving Minority student who is granted university admission, some deserving student is denied admission.  </p>
<p>Those thousands of full scholarships given to Minority students at Ivy League universities are not taken from the salaries of professors or school administrators.  No   &mdash;   those costs are simply added to the tuition, fees, room &amp; board of the paying (White) students.  <br>

		<p>So the IVY leagues think she is &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; and will add diversity?  I bet that even if she gets convicted, the Ivy league schools will still accept her at full scholarship.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but even though I love my children more than life itself, if one of them did this to me, they would be tossed in the slammer faster than you can believe.</p>

		<p>No doubt she&rsquo;ll be entered in the crime stats as &#8220;White&#8221;, and that will give the Ivy Leagues an excuse to reject her.  </p>

		<p>Yes I heard this story on the radio news this morning. The first thing I thought was. I bet the teenage girl was black. I was wrong what a bigot I am. She was Hispanic. Cant wait until she takes my daughters spot in that Ivy league college she want to go to.BTW my daughter wants an expensive pair of sunglasses. She has not pistol whipped my wife yet.</p>

		<p>Looks to me like, Ivy League acceptance or not, SOMEBODY should have taken a belt to little spoiled brat Rachel&rsquo;s behind a LONG time ago.  Kids don&rsquo;t behave like this when they are trained to behave like human beings instead of undisciplined pigs.  I promise you, my own mother would have punched my lights out, gun notwithstanding, if I had dared to do such a thing.  And frankly, it never would have occurred to me to do anything remotely like it; we were taught that throwing tantrums when we were told &#8220;No&#8221; generally led to a lot of physical pain in our backsides, so we learned not to do that.  Plus, any kid&rsquo;s bad behavior shamed his or her family.  Obviously Rachel doesn&rsquo;t care about anyone but herself - the original Copernican revolution, where everything revolves around her.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Suspect had been accepted to several Ivy League colleges.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we can be relatively certain it had nothing to do with being a non-white and affirmative action.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping some fools in the Ivy League line up will still be blessed with her trouble making and lack of impulse control, to say nothing of her stupidity to think she could ever get away with such a blatant act.  All of them deserve her. <br>

<p>She has been accepted into several Ivy League schools??? I cannot buy into that one. But of course we have seen in the last few decades what they do accept into our colleges and how they have dumbed down the requirements, haven&rsquo;t we? </p>

		<p>If she gets a lawyer that is able to keep her out of jail [probably not so hard as no doubt she is generally a lovely girl and only the drugs caused a lapse in judgment (sarcastic)] she will most likely STILL have her choice of Ivy League schools.</p>
<p>Of course they are totally color blind, but dealing with such a trying life circumstance makes her much more valuable than some White kid who only helped out in a soup kitchen to show his understanding of the oppressed.</p>

Hechero&rsquo;s crime is indicative of the nature of multiculturalism as it expands under the guidance of the corporation.</p>
<p>As it spreads, it ferments a lower quality of character white American&rsquo;s associate with the third world.<br>

		<p>The car my mother helped me get when I was headed off to college was a well-used 1980 Honda Civic station wagon.  One of her bank commercial loan customers was a used car dealer.  He let us have at at his cost, which was normally just the down-payment (so if a customer defaulted on the rest of the loan, he wasn&rsquo;t out any money.)  $1350.  We paid cash.</p>
<p>No duress was needed.  It got good gas mileage, it was cheap to insure, it was simple to work on, and since it was a station wagon, there was plenty of space inside for taking stuff out from Boulder to Santa Cruz for college.  Best of all, nobody on earth would steal it.</p>
<p>This Hachero is obviously NOT Ivy League material.  Nobody with any brains even thinks about parking a car that looks new or remotely &#8220;blingy&#8221; in on campus student parking lots.  They quickly end up looking a long way from new.  Moreover, someone living on a typical college student&rsquo;s finances wants to avoid - at all costs - paying the higher insurance premiums associated with certain vehicles.  While the article says the car Hachero wanted was a 2004 model and thus not new, one of the hot buttons for insurance companies is Japanese sports cars being driven by teenagers; they pay through the nose for insurance.</p>
<p>The really good news here is that the gun was stolen along with four other guns in a residential burglary in the same area (also Lee county) last year.  Since this is a first offence for Hachero, and since she&rsquo;s female, the safe bet is that she sings like a canary about who sold her the gun, and they&rsquo;ll be able to round up some people a lot more dangerous than a spoiled brat who wanted a flashy car.  Guns and drugs and home invasions are a nasty combination; World War Two marine ace Marion Carl, who shot down Japanese navy ace Junichi Sasai with a vertical 90-degree deflection shot through Sasai&rsquo;s cockpit floor was murdered with a shotgun by a home invader in 1998.<br>

		<p>Let me guess.  She thought she deserved someone &#8220;giving&#8221; her a car, (in this case, &#8220;giving&#8221; in terms of being able to piggyback on her parents&rsquo; presumably good credit rating), simply because she graduated from high school, or is about to.  When I was growing up, I was told from the moment I was old enough to understand that I was never going to be given an automobile, that if I wanted one, I&rsquo;d have to work for the money to buy the car and keep on working for the money to maintain and insure the car, and that the absolute MOST my parents or uncles or aunts would do is to go &#8220;halfsies&#8221; on the purchase price if I did something good to deserve it.  And they all held true to that promise   &mdash;   It wasn&rsquo;t until I graduated college that they kept their &#8220;halfsies&#8221; promise.</p>
<p>I agree with what they did.  A car is just way too valuable an asset to make your children think they&rsquo;re entitled to one.</p>

		<p>The gun used in the assault was reported stolen from the home of a Lee County Port Authority Officer in Fort Myers in July of 2010. 5 gins and several items were taken during that burglary.</p>
<p>Hachero went to Sutherlin Nissan on South Tamiami Trail, she had her mother sign for a 2004 black Nissan 350z</p>
<p>What exactly qualified her for acceptance into Ivy League schools? Obviously just her red-brown skin and her boyfriend&rsquo;s black skin, and nothing else. That&rsquo;s RACIST!..Oh, only if she were white.</p>

		<p>Question #2: Where&rsquo;s dad?</p>
<p>If I came home and my wife was bearing the marks of a &#8216;pistol whipping&rsquo;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/TePBa</p>
<p>There would be answers and there would be cops.  Or there would be a couple more badly bruised bodies in dire need of medical care.  Or a mortician.</p>
<p>No nuclear family.  No patriarchal influence.  =  No irreversible odds when this kind of thing happens.</p>
<p>Now, instead of being counter intimidated into doing the -right thing- (getting her own down payment after a summer schlepping at whatever), her life is over because this is &#8216;with intent&rsquo; (weapon as part of two separate, overarching, crimes).</p>
<p>What a waste.</p>
