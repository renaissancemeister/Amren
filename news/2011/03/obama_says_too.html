<h1><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D9M8H7I81&amp;show_article=1">Obama Says Too Much Testing Makes Education Boring</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Erica Werner, Breitbart, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>President Barack Obama said Monday that students should take fewer standardized tests and school performance should be measured in other ways than just exam results. Too much testing makes education boring for kids, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too often what we have been doing is using these tests to punish students or to, in some cases, punish schools,&#8221; the president told students and parents at a town hall hosted by the Univision Spanish-language television network at Bell Multicultural High School in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Obama, who is pushing a rewrite of the nation&rsquo;s education law that would ease some of its rigid measurement tools, said policymakers should find a test that &#8220;everybody agrees makes sense&#8221; and administer it in less pressure-packed atmospheres, potentially every few years instead of annually.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing I never want to see happen is schools that are just teaching the test because then you&rsquo;re not learning about the world, you&rsquo;re not learning about different cultures, you&rsquo;re not learning about science, you&rsquo;re not learning about math,&#8221; the president said. &#8220;All you&rsquo;re learning about is how to fill out a little bubble on an exam and little tricks that you need to do in order to take a test and that&rsquo;s not going to make education interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And young people do well in stuff that they&rsquo;re interested in,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;They&rsquo;re not going to do as well if it&rsquo;s boring.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Obama, who has been pushing his education agenda all month, has expressed concern that too many schools will be unable to meet annual proficiency standards under the No Child Left Behind law this year. The standards are aimed at getting 100 percent of students proficient in math, reading and science by 2014, a goal now widely seen as unrealistic.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has proposed replacing those standards with a less prescriptive requirement that by 2020 all students graduating from high school should be ready for college or a career.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Latino students make up one in five of all students in prekindergarten through high school in the U.S. but lag far behind whites in educational attainment, with less than one in three graduating from high school, according to federal Education Department figures. Obama emphasized to his largely Hispanic audience the importance of staying in school and he noted that more and more jobs will require advanced degrees.</p>

		<p>Finally he said something that makes sense, but it&rsquo;s too little, too late.  The testing mania is firmly entrenched and supported by Both the Left and the Right.  (Michelle Rhee, Bill Gates, Joel Klein, etc worship the data that testing produces!)</p>
<p>Now teachers are all scared about losing their jobs based on all these tests that our mostly low IQ students can&rsquo;t hope to pass.  This has led BOTH the Left and Right to attack teachers as the root of the problem, when no teacher can change IQ or bad life circumstances for the students.</p>
<p>So now we test Shaquanda (from broken home and poor) and Pablo (illegal immigrant in tenth grade with second grade skills) to death and fire the teachers when they can&rsquo;t pass.  This has brought our &#8216;brain-trust&rsquo; of teachers to the brink of ruination.  The &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; and &#8216;diverse&rsquo; teachers they want to bring in to replace all those crusty white teachers will cheat their way to good data, and our students of color will learn even less in the future.</p>
<p>What can we do?  Most white teachers, as you may have heard, who live in urban areas, send their children to private schools.  All others should do so also, unless they live in a rural white area.</p>

		<p>Sarcasm ON:</p>
<p>In other announcements, Obama wants Ostriches to swim better and penguins to fly like eagles. He wants to institute &#8220;Bird Diversity Awareness Month&#8221; in the avian schools across the nation.  He also wants the eagles and parrots to swim better and the parakeets to run equally as well as the ostriches. &#8221; all birds, are created equal, and should all be equal in results.&#8221; he was quoted as saying&hellip;   </p>

		<p>Sorry to burst your bubble, Mr President, but spending excessive time on testing is not the root cause of Hispanic and Black failure.  Actually, I suspect that you know that already, but you&rsquo;re looking for a way to keep people from seeing those embarrassing test scores.  I&rsquo;m no fan of No Child Left Behind, but it does generate some interesting numbers.   </p>

		<p>Religion is Belief in the absence of perception. Our President&rsquo;s view on education amounts to a religion that preaches that sitting in a classroom can increase innate intellect. Unfortunately, this religion has been effectively adopted by the government of the United States of America, making us kind of a Theocracy in this regard. Anyway, I get sick of Arne Duncan saying that America&rsquo;s teachers suck.</p>
<p>America has the second best educational outcomes in the world, behind only Finland. This is proven by those Truth-revealing numbers that our President despises:</p>

		<p>So now, after seeing that 80% of schools will fail to meet No Child Left Behind standards, the Prez does a 180 degree turn and is against the whole teach-to-the-test, meet-standard-proficiencies logic!  I must say I agree with him here.  We should just let the blacks and browns have their own schools, with their own teachers, and their own curricula.  We whites should just leave them alone and not hold them to our standards.  We should &#8220;punish&#8221; them no more.</p>

		<p>I do think we developed an educational system set up just so people are prepared to take &#8220;tests&#8221; with very little actual learning. Never mind how it affects blacks, I know they&rsquo;re beyond help and I&rsquo;m not interested in helping them anyways. I&rsquo;m worried about whites. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to suggest something different, and argue why race realists should be engaged in &#8220;traditional&#8221; conservative arguments as well.  </p>
<p>For decades, big-government statists have been pushing for more Federal control on state/local and private issues of education, health care, the economy, etc.  This, coupled with the failure a diversity utopia is supposed to provide, has led a well-educated, moderately intelligent president offering lame excuses for poor performance one would expect to hear only from the dumb kids retaking the ninth grade themselves&hellip;&#8221;test taking is about learning tricks&#8221;, &#8220;standardized tests are boring&hellip;&#8221; In other words, what every honest teacher knows to be false.</p>
<p>So, the solution?  The Republicans (if they had the stones) should immediately repeal NCLB and begin hearings to abolish the Department of Education.  </p>
<p>And we should be leading the charge.  The political climate has prevented any real discussions about racial differences with regard to intelligence and educational abilities, and when discussions do occur, the discussion devolves into the &#8220;white male power structure&#8221; and &#8220;systematic discrimination&#8221; of America that only fuels the fire of black insanity toward reality.  </p>
<p>However, if we appeal to a limited form of government  &mdash;  one put in place by the Constitution, statists on both sides of the aisle will not be allowed to push through inane policies that hurt all of America, but only in areas they control.  If Detroit wants to abolish testing, I say let them do it.  But when D.C. has no power over the education system; sensible, white-controlled municipalities won&rsquo;t be constrained by Federal policies enacted to mask black inabilities.</p>

		<p>This my get some of my fellow Amreners upset, to be honest, I agree with President Obama on this one.  While I have no problem with testing, you can test students in a variety of ways - oral examinations, papers, essays etc&hellip; In fact, I would argue that the aforementioned methods would be a far more   productive way in determining the proficency level of students.</p>
<p>The fact is that we are a nation that spends far too effort on standardized testing. Moreover, the only people who benefit from this policy are the testing companies who make millions psychologically manipulating parents, teachers and students into believing that an excessive amount of standard test taking is the most effective way in determining a student&rsquo;s academic proficency.</p>

		<p>I enjoyed tests in school. They were the intellectual equivalent of sports contests. Healthy people have a desire to know their maximum abilities and know how those abilities stack up against others&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a part of learning who you are, both as an individual and a member of society.</p>

		<p>Tests? Tests are how we measure the knowledge of students! How else will we know where they excel and where they need help?<br>
I am young and in college now, and we take many tests and quizzes but you will not hear me complaining! <br>
So long as the teacher is capable and you have all the necessities for being a student, there should be nothing stopping you from studying and at least passing a test.<br>
 <br>
You know why they don&rsquo;t like tests? Because Africans and mestizos don&rsquo;t retain knowledge or value knowledge like whites. Education is racist, thus, it must be dumbed down beyond use to make the non-whites &ldquo;excel&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate, I was homeschooled up until college and my parents held very high standards.  I&rsquo;m not the smartest person around, but I&rsquo;d like to take comfort in that professionals with degrees actually earned it! <br>

		<p>In schooling, as elsewhere, what gets measured tends to get done.<br>
Yet the vast commercial publication of tests is little short of a racket. &#8220;Quick and dirty&#8221; tests generated frequently right in the school attendance center are sufficient &#8220;feedback&#8221; indicators; however, the conflict of interest is obvious in that those putting together and administering such &#8220;quick and dirty&#8221; tests have too much stake in the results.  As public schools, schools should be<br>
able to simply use current video technology to capture what is and isn&rsquo;t happening in any classroom and put it online with as little as 48 hr. delay.  You can tell very quickly from such technological omniscience whether the teacher is getting the job done. And which students are disengaged.  </p>

<p>I watched some movies over the weekend, and noticed that all the smart people were of color. The evil people were all white males. I think the solution is to send black kids to drama class and have scripts written where they are the smart ones and whites are dumb. In fact we can make their entire life a script. Every time they pick up their welfare check, they get a new script where they just invented something useful, cured cancer, or saved the world from some evil white man.</p>

		<p>Blacks on average I have noticed do not do as well on standardized tests as whites. The reason? The tests must be racist! We know that race is a social construct, so it couldn&rsquo;t be anything but white racism, somehow whites have in their wickedness concocted tests which are deliberately designed to make blacks fail! Tests are a form of institutional racism against blacks! We must burn the racist test papers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad brother Obama is onto the racist tests! Any attempt to measure black ability is clearly just another attempt by whites to promote white supremacy and racism!</p>

		<p>Why bother testing. As a matter of fact why even make them attend schools. I think all blacks and browns should at the age of 18 receive high school diplomas, wait 4 more years and get your undergrad degree, 2-3 more years, Masters and PhD. Little darlings wouldn&rsquo;t get bored anymore and, just think, how affordable the Higher Education would become.</p>

No one but a huckster for Charles Atlas pretends that it is possible to take a sickly, fifteen year old &#8220;97 pound weakling&#8221; and turn him into an award winning athlete. Nevertheless, many continue to claim that the right educational environment can turn any child into a successful professional. </p>

		<p>I would have to come out against this testing mania.  Mainly because it&rsquo;s hurting white teachers in largely minority schools, and the maniacal attitude toward standardized testing practically begs cheating (AR had a few of those stories earlier this week).  On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t think that is President Obama&rsquo;s motivation for bemoaning testing   &mdash;   I think he&rsquo;s just embarrassed that most tests show blacks and Hispanics scoring the lowest on average.</p>
<p>Steve Sailer tends to think that where all of this is leading is that standardized school tests will eventually become like drivers license written tests   &mdash;   Blessedly easy and pass/fail in essence.  That&rsquo;s the only way to &#8220;narrow the racial gap.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Up until about 40 years ago, education in the United States worked very well. Why? Because it was designed by white people for the education of white children, testing them on what they had learned and using the test results to go back over what they missed to make sure they did learn it, if they didn&rsquo;t get it the first time around. <br>
Now you can&rsquo;t use that method with 3rd world people from every &#8220;diverse&#8221; corner of the globe. Their children cannot be taught the same way white children are taught, because they do not learn in the same way. They need to be taught in a different manner, by teachers of their own kind. They need to be taught in segregated schools, with teachers who not only &#8220;look like them&#8221;, but think like them and know how to get the knowledge into the students&rsquo; heads. Lowering standards and throwing millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars into trying to level the &#8220;education gap&#8221; has not worked in the past, and it will not work now or in the future. Segregation of schools is the only thing that will work, not only for whites, but blacks as well.   </p>

		<p>I remember when I was in school, some of the kids had to have the test read to them.<br>
A proper school would segregate groups based on race and IQ. But really, homeschooling is the best way to go, it allows children to learn from people who are not only like them, they are family.</p>
<p>On a similar note, schools in South Africa have such low standards, designed to make African kids look smart, that white children pass with twice as many points.</p>

This is actually a great coup for the mulitCULTuralist.</p>
<p>Every time someone talks about testing, they will point to the authority of the President who has confirmed that testing is over rated.</p>

		<p>What should we expect from a man who must have benefitted from Affirmative Action all his life, and would never have become president, had he not been Black?</p>

		<p>Standardized testing in the form it takes today does not accomplish much. It forces schools to teach to the tests. And for all the blather about &#8220;diversity,&#8221; it does not recognize the real differences in regional educational requirements. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one more part of the centralization of power at the federal level. </p>
<p><i>The Republicans (if they had the stones) should immediately repeal NCLB and begin hearings to abolish the Department of Education. </i></p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Reagan promised to do this, but never followed through. The GOP wants to have big government power centralized in DC so they too can use it to lord it over Americans (and third worlders who mass migrate here). </p>

		<p>&#8220;And young people do well in stuff they&rsquo;re interested in&#8221;.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Obama</p>
<p>I suppose written English was never this community organizer&rsquo;s strong suit, as although Winston Churchill once joked about ending sentences with prepositions, one really shouldn&rsquo;t begin a sentence with &#8220;And&#8221;.</p>
<p>That said, assuming Obama is correct in the thrust of the statement if not the grammar, perhaps we should test the diversitoids on their accumen in street pharmacology, obscene rap lyrics and ethnic grievance fantasies instead of the &#8220;three R&rsquo;s&#8221;.</p>
<p>This will produce precisely the sort of Americans we need if we are to become a third-world agrarian nation that exists only to supply China with adequate quantities of soybeans, rice and occasional non-ferrous metals - the latter assumes that the EPA will continue to allow mineral extraction here.</p>
