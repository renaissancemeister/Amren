<h1>Urban Native Americans Feel They Have a Foot in Two Worlds</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Dawn Turner Trice, Chicago Tribune, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Susan] Power [a Dakota Sioux] left the reservation in 1942 and moved to Chicago to care for a relative. {snip} She said it wasn&rsquo;t until 1961 when she attended a conference organized by noted University of Chicago anthropologist Sol Tax that she got a chance to address something many urban Indians were struggling with: the feeling of having a foot in two worlds and not belonging entirely to either.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Power will join other Native Americans from around the country at the University of Chicago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the conference many considered to be a groundbreaking event.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first time that Indians from the reservation and from the city came together,&#8221; Power said. &#8220;The conference helped remind people that whatever differences that were cropping up, those of us in urban areas still belonged to the reservation as if we were living there on a daily basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 700 Native Americans attended that event and later presented the concerns of more than 80 tribal groups to the federal government. The conference, called the Declaration of Indian Purpose, reaffirmed the need for tribes to come together to protect their treaty rights and sovereignty.</p>
<p>The goal of Saturday&rsquo;s conference, which Power helped conceive, is to create a new national agenda for Native Americans who live in cities and are dealing with poor access to quality health care, high dropout rates and high unemployment, among other things.</p>
<p>Organizers of this year&rsquo;s conference are concerned that although urban Indians on average outnumber those on reservations 10-to-1, native people in urban areas are often invisible when it comes to getting federal funding geared toward Indians.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>She said the idea that Indians on reservations benefit greatly from the largess of casinos is a myth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tribes don&rsquo;t have sufficient funding to run their schools, hospitals and roads,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But people in cities want the ability to compete for funding designated for Indian people. The goal has to be to help everyone prosper and pull forward.&#8221;<br>

		<p>Well, they do have a foot in two worlds. Almost literally so. Are citizens of the U.S. and at the same time citizens of their respective American Indian nation. Super-citizens so to speak.</p>
<p>According the U.S. Supreme Court, a legal status UNIQUE among ALL people of the world.</p>
<p>I send a variety of posts to Dawn but never get a reply. Hope you have better luck.</p>

		<p>A lot of us &#8220;urban Indians&#8221; are fully integrated. Maybe back before the twenties, tribal enrollees were &#8220;sovereign nations&#8221;, but after that the tribes were to be considered more like states, than nations. Cherokee have no ambassadors to other nations, nor do any other American tribe that I know. The only ones complaining about no access to financial funds are the &#8220;wannabes&#8221;,those who think being Indian is better than white. And to be honest, it&rsquo;s about the same. We are no longer a &#8220;favored&#8221; minority. Blacks and Hispanics get much much more weight in Affirmative Action than an Indian (this from a friend in college admissions).  We are too white-friendly, I guess.</p>
<p>As for intermarriage rates, who in their right mind would marry a drunk druggie? Too many rez Indians are both. And the rest are the politicians, who are only one of those, thus functioning corruptly.</p>
<p>Complete confession: my family has always been marrying non-Indians, and I am married to a white.</p>

		<p>My primary contact with Indians (feather not dot) was when I interviewed for a position in Billings, MT. There is a Crow Indian reservation about 30 miles down the road. I was told that the Billings Police Department uses a &#8220;drunk bus&#8221; to round up the usual suspects every government payday. It would not surprise me if a larger than average number of people incarcerated in Montana hail from some tribe. There is a reason it is called a reservation (or plantation) mentality. </p>
<p>I have a brother in law who is either 1/16 or 1/32 Indian. He is not pining for the reservation. The man has a very good job and is a model citizen (unless you hate people who don&rsquo;t commit crimes, pay their taxes, and raise responsible kids.) </p>

<p>Maybe that is the problem, at least for Whites.</p>
<p>As for Indians getting anything &#8220;sovereign&#8221; such as their own lands (and many freebies from our government) within America maybe it is Whites that are entitled to all of the above.</p>
<p> Maybe the Indians OWE us????</p>

<p>Gee sekhemtratra, sovereign nations also don&rsquo;t accept support from other nations, especially their &#8220;oppressors.&#8221;  The Amerind situation is unique in the world.  The U.S. set up large reservations, granted exclusive privileges such as hunting and fishing rights, gaming rights that have seen huge casino industry all over the country, millions and millions of dollars gained. Even so, reservation indians continue to have problems with alcohol and drugs.  Indians are genetic alcoholics, this is no new news.  The problem for any people or person is lack of self-knowledge and self-discipline.  </p>
<p>Amerinds have the same problem whites have.  It is that of being combined as the host races.  The new immigrants coming in are overwhelming our history and memory, since they are taught nothing about it, or if they are, it is as a sort of indoctrination in a permission to supplant it.  Indians have lands that only they can use.  If only whites did!  I would move there tomorrow!</p>

<p>So how many generations have your line married into whites?  At what point are  you really white because you&rsquo;re only one sixteenth Amerind.  I&rsquo;ve met many blue eyed blondes who tell me they are Cherokee.  Are you one of them?</p>
<p>But I give you credit for knowing the reservation scene and reporting it honestly.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem as if anyone can help Indians.  The reason is that they won&rsquo;t help themselves.  They&rsquo;re inherently lazy and got hooked on government hand-outs back in the 19th century.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confession; I have &#8220;dated&#8221; (ran around with) a few Amerind women in my life.  They were okay, but they had coping problems, it was clear.  But I consider dating an Amerind more American than dating any other non-white.  I just don&rsquo;t know why anyone would want to, as you say&hellip;.</p>
