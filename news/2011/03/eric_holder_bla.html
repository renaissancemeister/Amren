<h1>Eric Holder: Black Panther Case Focus Demeans &#8216;My People&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Josh Gerstein, Politico, March 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Attorney General Eric Holder finally got fed up Tuesday with claims that the Justice Department went easy in a voting rights case against members of the New Black Panther Party because they are African American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Attorney General seemed to take personal offense at a comment Culberson [Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas)] read in which former Democratic activist Bartle Bull called the incident the most serious act of voter intimidation he had witnessed in his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think about that,&#8221; Holder said. &#8220;When you compare what people endured in the South in the 60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, and to compare what people were subjected to there to what happened in Philadelphia  &mdash;  which was inappropriate, certainly that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to describe it in those terms I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line, who risked all, for my people,&#8221; said Holder, who is black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;To compare that kind of courage, that kind of action, and to say that the Black Panther incident wrong though it might be somehow is greater in magnitude or is of greater concern to us, historically, I think just flies in the face of history and the facts.,&#8221; Holder said with evident exasperation.</p>
<p>In a series of questions and comments earlier in the hearing, Culberson insisted that race had infected the decision-making process. &#8220;There&rsquo;s clearly evidence, overwhelming evidence, that your Department of Justice refuses to protect the rights of anybody other than African Americans to vote,&#8221; the Texas Republican said. &#8220;There&rsquo;s a pattern of a double standard here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What the black endured in the South is nothing compared<br>
to the invasion, degradation and corruption of White Europeans<br>
in the USA from unrelenting liberal assault.<br>
When blacks screamed discrimination the Federal Govt and <br>
the media, and the liberal elite ran in circles giving them<br>
anything they wanted.<br>
One thing whites know..NO one will help us. And when we<br>
lose our country NO one will take us in and the entire world<br>
will cheer our demise. After all we have dwindled to 10% of the worlds population. <br>
We are alone..we always have been. But we have each other. <br>
Its time to fight back.</p>

The issue isn&rsquo;t relativism, the issue is equal enforcement under the law.</p>

		<p>This is what blacks are best at: getting all uppity and emotional and wallowing in victimhood.</p>

<p>What does that have to do with anything? Since the quote was referring to what he had <i>witnessed in his career</i> and, according to my research, Bartle Bull was born in 1970 and Culberson graduated from Southern Methodist University (SMU) in 1981, then what does what blacks &#8220;endured in the South in the 60s&#8221; have to do with anything?</p>
<p>All Holder demonstrated was his irrationality and bias.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Think about that,&rdquo; Holder said. &ldquo;When you compare what people endured in the South in the 60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, and to compare what people were subjected to there to what happened in Philadelphia &mdash; which was inappropriate, certainly that &hellip; to describe it in those terms I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line, who risked all, for my people,&rdquo; said Holder, who is black.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s revealing his anti-white hatred, as well as deep resentments of incidents of the past, true or not, although neither of his emotional hang-ups have anything to do with present day events and enforcing the law equally.  He&rsquo;s showing us that he&rsquo;s nothing but the average mentally challenged black who maintains a &#8220;them against us attitude,&#8221; which disqualifies him for the office of AG.</p>
<p>Note that the injustices that blacks dig up to complain about are incidents of the past they usually never experienced, but only read about or heard about, while whites complain about black murders, assaults, robberies, rapes and brutish loud personalities and intellects that are around 8th grade levels, all of which occur right now on a daily basis, yet blacks maintain whites have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>I love to see these black miscreants put under pressure, because they invariably crack, revealing a level of bias and racism that they try to s off s being endemic within the white community.</p>
<p>As I said before, if we see the community organizer really pressed on anything we will see him implode right before our eyes.</p>

		<p> Right is right and wrong is wrong. How dare blacks presume that they have a free pass forever because of slavery (every race of man has been enslaved at some time or another throughout history)? Or because of some civil rights battles back in the &rsquo;60s? If voter intimidation is wrong, then it&rsquo;s wrong, no matter who is practicing it, no matter who is being intimidated.</p>
<p> Holder knows this, but his visceral commitment to the proposition that &#8220;the White man&#8221; is always at fault, always to blame, and cannot every be termed a &#8220;victim&#8221; is so strong, that he cannot or will not order his department to do the right thing. Hence, his mini-temper tantrum before the congressional committee. He gave the game away when he referred to blacks as &#8220;my people.&#8221;</p>
<p> When one knows he is wrong, but will not admit it, he will when challenged on his error, defend it with unusual force and venom. Shakespeare, who left us so many memorable sayings, wrote a line in one of his plays that sums it up perfectly: &#8220;Methinks the lady doth protest too much!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Whether or not Mr. Holder views blacks as &ldquo;his people&rdquo; he is an American government official, not an African-American government official. If he see&rsquo;s blacks as &ldquo;his people&rdquo; when he acts as Attorney general, that presents a major problem. He is supposed to work for American citizens regardless of their ethnic background. As a European-American citizen, it makes me wonder if he sees me as one of his &ldquo;people&rdquo;? Is he black or American?<br>
Politicians are never to involve themselves personally in such issues, simply because they can easily alienate others. Then again, is this the first time that Holder has made his racial views well known? <br>

		<p> It&rsquo;s always interesting to me how black people like Holder always revert back to the so called civil rights era. I mean it&rsquo;s like the worlds history started and ended with black civil rights in the United States.It&rsquo;s also very frightening that someone in the justice department like Holder can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t view evidence without bias.Does this mean that black jurist are getting a green light from the justice department to use the history of so called civil rights to disregard or minimize crimes against white people?</p>

		<p>I would venture to say that Mr. Holder is on our side, or at least on the side of being a racialist.  If he were to take all of -his people- and segregate from us, would anyone here complain?  I am of the opinion that we should encourage the obivious race based behavior of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, as it can only hasten the coming ethnocentric breakup of America.</p>

		<p>The attorney general is an obvious racist who holds resentments and hatreds that disqualify him to hold the job.</p>
<p>With him at the helm it is no wonder the standard operating policy for the US attorny&rsquo;s offices throughout the country is to ignore cases where whites have been victimized.</p>
<p>But he&rsquo;s just one more of many hate-mongers in this pro-black administration.  If this country&rsquo;s white electorate re-elects this black racist president again in 2012, they deserve to be extinguished as a people, with their history, culture and traditions erased forever from the pages of history, because that is EXACTLY what will occur.</p>
<p>That not one of the Republicans is asking for this racist AG&rsquo;s resignation is really troubling.</p>

		<p>Eric Holder&rsquo;s forebearers apparently weren&rsquo;t deterred enough by what was happening to &#8216;his people&rsquo; before the civil rights movement of the 60s (he was born in NY in 1951)since they voluntarily  decided to emigrate from Barbados to the US before that period. </p>

Sooner or later, right of left, they will invariably reveal their true selves and their true concerns.</p>

		<p>holder, married to a blonde white woman why is he NOT married to one of his own kind, his people?  better yet, why is he not in africa working for his people?  but instead hanging out in an advanced country built by white brain power.  like barry, his boss, he is an affirmative action product due to the generosity of the whites.  This would not happen in China and holder knows it.</p>

		<p>Let the enemy use his own words and actions to sink him. &#8220;My people&#8221; does not equal &#8220;We, the people&#8221; in this man&rsquo;s mind, even though he is the highest law enforcement official in the land. Never forget what he said.</p>
<p>Read #6 for an explanation of why this individual is too dimwitted to be the Attorney General, regardless of his qualifications on paper. The law is all about using words to jerk people around, afterall, and here Holder completely fumbles pragmatically and semantically.</p>
<p>Holder is about as black as my sister after a tanning session, and frankly I think that&rsquo;s part of the problem. He knows he can never quite be white no matter how close he comes to it, so he has to identify inordinately with blackness. His personal demons are affecting his job performance, and he should resign if he can&rsquo;t enforce the law without biase.</p>

Tribalism may have disappeared among White people, but every other ethnicity on planet Earth understands it.  The only thing that all non-Whites can agree upon is that they hate us and want to take our wealth from us by force.  Holder and Obama want to see the end of white dominance and the White race.

		<p>   I have always maintained that Eric Holder was nothing more than A affirmative action appointee. Obama is an affirmative action president, by that I mean most Blacks and liberals (democrats) who voted for Obama did so because he is black. I dont see how we can expect anything other than what we are getting. He was affirmed in hearings by A group of mostly liberal bleeding heart liberals,the agenda was that the attorney general be black.</p>

		<p>One of these Black Panthers that Holder and Obama are protecting was shown by Fox News standing on a busy corner screaming about killing &#8220;all the whites and their blond haired, blue eyed babies, too.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Everytime there is news to report on this story this hate-filled warning, full of murderous intent for whites and white babies, should be shown in order to properly reference the Black Panther incident in its entirety in order to fully inform the viewing audience as to the depths of anti-white hatred and racism being ignored by this Obama and Holder.  Both men approve of it or they, at the very least, would openly condemn it, yet neither they nor anyone in the entire black leadership has done so. </p>
<p>IN fact, have we heard condemnation from blacks in general or the black leadership specifically about ANY black on white outrages of which there are literally thousands of cases every year? </p>
<p>We have not.</p>

<p> We all know how racist Holder is, I think everybody knows it.  Ninety percent of us still have our heads in the sand though.  That is a problem.  </p>

		<p>This is an open admission of flagrant racism and discrimination against white people by the U.S. Attorney General. This racist hate monger is a disgrace to the U.S. and office of the DOJ. Holder being in charge means &#8220;open season on white people&#8221; and you can just forget about any kind of justice. Since Obama is the one that appointed Eric Holder this must mean he thinks the same way. If Obama doesn&rsquo;t fire this joker &#8220;immediately&#8221; he can kiss any chance of being re-elected good-by. Where is the media?     </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s clear now, if ever there was a doubt, that nonwhites, even at the highest levels of accomplishment, do not possess the qualities necessary for governing a diverse population. Some people on this forum have already summed it up quite well, but I&rsquo;d like to say it again: Whites have a more natural tendency towards impartiality than do nonwhites.</p>
<p>Considering that this is basically an indisputable fact of nonwhite sociology and probably psychology, I propose legislation that would bar nonwhites from holding positions in government, or at least that they be limited to a certain small percentage relative to the percentage of offices held by whites.</p>

		<p>Blacks always like to use long ago history such as slavery or Jim Crow to justify inappropriate behavior today. What happened fifty or hundreds of years ago means nothing in making current decissions. It&rsquo;s like a mass murderer justifying his actions because he didn&rsquo;t get a new bicycle when he was 9 years old. When this thinking comes from a high level official,we are in trouble.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Fairness,&#8221; &#8220;Rule of Law,&#8221; &#8220;The Common Good,&#8221; are all explicitly white-endorsed concepts. It is foolish and dangerous to expect those of non-European stock to embrace them. We must learn to extend these socio-political favors to our racial comrades EXCLUSIVELY. </p>

		<p>I hate to say this but this only goes to show that it is not in the country&rsquo;s best interest to have nonwhites in power. They can&rsquo;t get over the past even if they themselves did not live through any of the past experiences. They constantly try to make white America guilty. As a white American, I&rsquo;m sick of it.</p>

		<p>Tim in Indiana,</p>
<p>Very good points and something that I missed.  Holder can&rsquo;t even debate logically.  Of course bringing up the past, even if it was 100 years ago, is always fair game when debating current issues regarding 25 year old black thugs.<br>

		<p>Excellent comments, all. Holder is a typical vile, arrogant, angry, unqualified black dangerously put in a job he shouldn&rsquo;t hold. And the thing that keeps on keeping on bugging me: This Holder comment about &#8220;my people.&#8221;  Why do all bi-racial people, many of whom marry whites, consider only the black side of their ancestry? How can one have so much disdain for half of one&rsquo;s heritage? Then, ADDITIONALLY enter into marriage with one of that rejected race AND create more biracial, resentful offspring? </p>
<p>In Atlanta one of the local news affiliates is doing a series on its anchor derived from the TV show &#8216;Who Do You Think You Are&rsquo; (or something to that effect), researching ancestry records. A very popular, classy, biracial female anchor was the subject of one search, and her entire biography focused on the maternal black &#8216;slave&rsquo; side of her family. If one didn&rsquo;t know any better, it was as if she HAD no father he nor anyone in that side of the family was alluded to. It was as if they didn&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s beyond me how even the upscale biracials have no regard, in fact, even shun the white side of the family. Black truly is pervasive to the point of tunnel vision - in attitude AND behavior.</p>

		<p>Someone in the media&hellip;I think Rush Limbaugh,  said that having our first black president would make race relations worse.  He said EVERY issue would come down to race.  I agreed when he said that&hellip;.and we were correct !</p>
<p>I was never very political until this past presidential election.  I did my part and voted for McCain who was far and away the better, more qualified candidate.  However, in the next election I will actually be out stumping for whom-ever runs agains Obama.  </p>

		<p>I have been waiting for someone to mention Holder&rsquo;s role in the Mark Rich pardon circus at the end of the Clinton White House tenure. Since I have seen no such reference here goes. Holder was the errand boy on that transaction and when questioned about was, as might expect, silent. It was assumed that either his incompetence or his &#8220;ethical lapse&#8221; would rule out any chance at the AG position in any future Democratic cabinet. He is now as he was then: a two bit ideologue who had best remain quiet; in silence is his only haven. </p>

Asian politicians look out for Asian voters<br>
Black politicians look out for black voters<br>
Hispanic politicians look out for Hispanic voters<br>
White politicians look out for ALL of their constituents&hellip;..why is that?</p>
<p> The problem with this statement is that white politicians are primarily there to benefit all other groups except whites.</p>

<p>Not only was he involved in the Mark Rich pardon circus but that of the bomb setting, violent, marxist, Puerto Rican FALN as well.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought of eric holder (no caps) as a useful idiot, drunk with undeserved power to carry out his racist fantasies, too dimwitted to understand the commands of his masters.  He&rsquo;s another black foil for the real power-brokers, easy to blame and easy to deflect away culpability:  </p>
<p>Any questions about what he&rsquo;s told to do = racism.</p>
<p><i>A March 2002 congressional report concluded that Rich&rsquo;s lawyers had tried to circumvent prosecutors and took their case directly to the White House. Holder&rsquo;s assistance in this process, coupled with his failure to alert prosecutors of a pending pardon, was crucial, said the report.</i></p>
<p>On FALN:</p>
<p><i>A list of FALN documents withheld from Congress shows that many memos on the FALN clemency decision went directly to Holder.</i></p>
<p><i>Holder was methodically spearheading the march toward clemency   &mdash;   despite the fact that the sentencing judges, the U.S. Attorneys, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the FBI were unanimous in their opposition to pardoning the individuals in question.</i></p>
<p><i>Clemency was granted by President Clinton to sixteen terrorists, most of whom had served only a fraction of their prison terms. The Justice Department prevented FBI officials from testifying.</i></p>

<p>The 2012 opposition to 0bama should focus a laser beam on this racist, White-hating obstructionist to justice to get him out and send him back to Barbados.</p>

		<p> we might expect that many blacks would hold these views.. what i just can&rsquo;t fathom is the number of liberal whites who defend Holder and Obama on the case - it&rsquo;s so obviously irrational but you can tell it challenges their whole belief system and their messiah. </p>

		<p>Holder, no doubt and based on his own words &#8220;my people,&#8221; is a racist, period. If the people were black and instead of Black Panthers, the 2 men were wearing K clothing and carrying the same clubs, there would be no end to the cacophony of racial complaints.   But because these men were black, and the AG is black the situation is acceptable. Now that is RACISM! </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Think about that,&rdquo; Holder said. &ldquo;When you compare what people endured in the South in the 60s to try to get the right to vote for African Americans, and to compare what people were subjected to there to what happened in Philadelphia &mdash; which was inappropriate, certainly that &hellip; to describe it in those terms I think does a great disservice to people who put their lives on the line, who risked all, for my people,&rdquo; said Holder, who is black.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holder, you incompetent AA appointment!  You never mention the &#8220;Panther&#8221; who stood on South Street calling White women &#8220;whores&#8221; and calling for the killing of &#8216;crackers and their little babies&#8221;. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken he was one of the two outside of the polling place. </p>
<p>You and your wife probably have as much White ancestry as you do black.</p>
