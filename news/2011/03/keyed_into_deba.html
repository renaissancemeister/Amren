<h1>Keyed Into Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Keilman, Chicago Tribune, March 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the Tribune and Sun-Times recently posted stories dealing with immigration, Sara McElmurry saw a familiar dynamic take shape. The online comments following the pieces were heavily negative, with some casting immigrants as parasites or welfare cheats.</p>
<p>So McElmurry, communications manager for the Chicago-based advocacy group Latino Policy Forum, shot an email to her &#8220;Comment Corps&#8221;  &mdash;  a list of 3,000 people she asks to intervene when she believes online comments have become bigoted or monolithic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balance the rhetoric of fear by posting your own comment, using the talking points below as a guide,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;It takes only a few moments to make your voice heard!&#8221;</p>
<p>McElmurry and some like-minded allies are trying to influence opinion by engaging their foes in the new media&rsquo;s public square. By presenting their arguments in forums they see as one-sided, they hope to counter what they regard as misinformation and sway at least a few hearts and minds.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But William Gheen of the Internet-savvy Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, which is critical of what it views as the nation&rsquo;s lax border control, says the effort reveals the weakness of the pro-immigration cause.</p>
<p>His organization sends emails to more than 40,000 subscribers, he said, but he rarely asks anyone to comment on a news story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usually, we don&rsquo;t have to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Seventy to 80 percent of Americans feel the same way that we do.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the immigration advocates say the commentary following news stories has become so unrelentingly negative that it presents an inaccurate picture of the issue.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Her 50-person group, which calls itself the Blog Squad, was inspired in part by the angry conversations surrounding Arizona&rsquo;s crackdown on illegal immigrants. Members flagged news items that originated in outlets from the Huffington Post to Reuters and sought help in posting positive comments.</p>
<p>The group also tried to influence the discussion by rallying friends to vote in online surveys. {snip}</p>
<p>McElmurry, of the Latino Policy Forum, started her Comment Corps just a month ago. Her email alerts include talking points meant to lend credibility to pro-immigration posts, an approach she believes will prove more effective than angry confrontation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we see online is really fear-driven and very emotional and, from my perspective, not the most rational (argument),&#8221; she said. &#8220;If we can provide sound, truthful counterstatements to that and let people know the truth about the Latino population in this country, that&rsquo;s perhaps better than stoking the flames.&#8221;<br>

		<p>You just knew there would be an increasingly intense attempt to disrupt the internet with various poseurs and trolls, just as was recommended by Obama&rsquo;s man Cass Sunstein. Pile on to give the impression that popular opinion leans this or that way; have trolls cruise websites to bait people into arguing with one another and create hostile factions; set up phony, competing websites to draw off the unwary; make false accusations against those who are too popular; the list goes on and is limited only by the imagination. A class of professional, paid trolls will probably come about who are more polished than the amateurs, probably paid for with your tax money. After all, look who&rsquo;s in charge of the public till these days.<br>

		<p>I am sure we have seen the effects of her Blog Squad (or similar goups) right here on Amren, which gets a flurry of such posts from time to time, all sounding more or the less the same and  generally attempting to divert the discussion away from the topic, when the discussion gets too hot.</p>

<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve often thought a &#8220;Comments Corp&#8221; for AmRen would be a good idea. In addition to preaching to the choir here, be sure to hit the link to the Original Article and duplicate your post there. If it requires login, go to:</p>

		<p>Two words:  Professional trolls.</p>
<p>I suspect some of these people will try and spam AR with their Raza/Democrat Party talking points.  May I make a friendly suggestion to the AR admins and mods that they keep a sharp eye out for it?  And obviously, not approve such comments if they are submitted.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a frequent Twitter user, and not only myself, and a lot of other people I follow, have noticed in the last week or so that we&rsquo;ve been getting a lot of unsolicited tweets directed at us from people whose screen names are explicitly anti-Republican or anti-conservative, with links to Democrat Party PR press releases.  I think the entire left wing is engaged in a big astroturfing effort.</p>

Miss McElmurry has absolutely no clue that it is THE PRESENCE of the Latino population in this country that is stoking the flames of ethnic conflict.  I wouldn&rsquo;t care if all Latinos were hard-working, quiet, well-mannered and spoke better English than I do, I still wouldn&rsquo;t want them here.</p>

<p>Did it ever occur to these fools that illegal immigration has become &#8220;unrelentingly negative&#8221; and quite accurate to 80% of the American public. </p>

		<p>So the claim is that whites are racists for being critical of hoards of illegal aliens.  We are expected to just lie down and accept the &#8220;Browning of America&#8221;, which in and of itself is a purely racist construct.  But how would they feel if we decided that there should be a &#8220;Whiting of Central America&#8221;?  Or a &#8220;Whiting of Africa&#8221; program?  If it&rsquo;s OK to &#8220;Brown&#8221; America then what other mechanism can be used that doesn&rsquo;t directly dispossess white Americans?  And we are called &#8220;racists&#8221; because we don&rsquo;t want to be replaced?<br>

<p>This goes on all the time with these &#8220;minority&#8221; groups. Can&rsquo;t have Whitey defending their own race and country, now can we, and speaking out against immigration and crime because they all know it is THEM that have created this problem in the first place.</p>
<p>Guess Amren will be next to be on their hit list.  Can&rsquo;t we also play fire with fire, or do we still have to &#8220;take the higher road&#8221; that has gotten us into this mess in the first place.</p>

		<p>I get the impression from reading online news forums that the debate is biased the other way towards favoring illegals and immigration. There are so many articles where you find the &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; slobber and maybe one or two comments that are opposed to it. Any thinking person knows they&rsquo;re blocking comments from people with pro-White views or allowing a couple in against a sea of multicult views to give some legitimacy to their stories.  What&rsquo;s more is that these multicult posts are largely not anonymous people posting personal views but an army of professional bloggers who are being paid to scan the web and spam sites with their propaganda.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Latinos&#8221; are a people who share one great salient characteristic: Complete inability to discuss a problem rationally if it involves disagreement with anyone outside their in-group.</p>
<p>If the antagonist  &mdash;  whoever stands in the way of getting whatever a Latino wants whenever he wants it and whether he deserves it or not  &mdash;  resists him in any way, it&rsquo;s &#8220;unfair.&#8221; If the antagonist is an Anglo/Gringo/White person, it&rsquo;s discriminatory as well as unfair. Never have I dealt with people so mentally limited by their own mass persecution complex.</p>
<p>This is why their &#8220;opinions&#8221; on politics and social policy are so infuriating, little more than slogan-spouting and a source of so much negative commentary.</p>
<p>Just about had to kick the TV in last night while listening to the latest whinefest/lawsuit against the Border Patrol for beating up an illegal alien after he struggled violently while they tried to deport him for the second time. His enablers showed pictures and a sob story of how he just wants to be united with his family living in the United States. As far as the cretin is concerned, it&rsquo;s all about HIM. Not a photon of mental energy devoted to:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  What gives him the right to be here in violation of our laws?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Why did he start a family here if he&rsquo;s not in our country legally?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  If he&rsquo;s so into raising his kids and that other family values stuff, why does he think and behave as if he were about twelve years old?</p>
<p>  &mdash;  If our society is so superior to his that he feels he just HAS to raise his family here, why doesn&rsquo;t he show more respect for it? If he feels his own society is better, why doesn&rsquo;t he return there and take his family with him?</p>
<p>These are the kinds of things you can NEVER discuss in any meaningful way with a Latino.</p>

Just the other day I herd a man from India spouting that same old tired speach about how all Americans are immigrants and there are no real citizens. You would think that every person in the world has a god given right to comes live at the expense of the American tax payer. </p>
<p>I think the news has spread that we are a nation of idiots and ready for the picking. You never hear anyone say they have a right to Russian citizenship do you. We should start putting some of the visitors to work in the salt mines that tends to take the sap out of them. </p>

Since he knows that I&rsquo;m his uncle behind the Nom de Web, he tries to debate instead of screening me out.  It&rsquo;s like beating a dead snake with one arm tied behind my back.

		<p>Mz.  McElmurry:</p>
<p>Whether you know it or not you are a brainwashed &#8220;useful&#8221; idiot who will never receive whatever it is your masters promised you.  Your reward will be a bullet in the back of the head after you&rsquo;ve served your purpose. You see, they despise you as much if not more than the native-born white population.</p>
<p>You write:</p>
<p><i>let people know the truth about the Latino population in this country, that&rsquo;s perhaps better than stoking the flames.</i></p>
<p>Oh, yes! Let&rsquo;s DO let the American people know the truth about the Latino population, shall we?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tell them about drunk driving accidents caused by Latinos who believe it&rsquo;s &#8220;manly&#8221; to knock back a six pack or a case of beer and get behind the wheel of a car.</p>
<p><i>No other ethnic or racial group has such a high level of DUI arrests statewide, according to the California Department of Justice.</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tell them about Latino welfare use and the costs of importing destitute, unskilled Mexicans and Central Americans:</p>
<p><i>Studies calculates that the average Mexican immigrant will collect $55,200 more in government services during his lifetime than he will pay in taxes.</i></p>
<p><i>Hispanics were about 50 percent more likely to be unemployed than whites;  fully half of all Hispanic households used at least one form of welfare, compared to 18 percent of whites.</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tell them about Latino crime rates, three-four times the rate of white crime: </p>
<p><i>Hispanics are 2.3 times more likely to be in prison than whites and are four times more likely than whites to commit murder, robbery or assault.</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s tell them about the high Latino teen birth rate:</p>
<p><i>Hispanic teens have the highest birthrate of any group, three times higher than Whites and 30% higher than Blacks</i></p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to include Latino drop-out rates:</p>
<p><i>Hispanics are nearly three times more likely to drop out of high school than whites&hellip;The average Hispanic 12th-grader reads and does math at about the level of the average white 8th-grader.</i></p>
<p>You do want white Americans, the ones who foot the bill to support these &#8220;immigrants&#8221;, to know the truth, do you not, about their own race replacement?  Or are these &#8220;Hate Facts&#8221; as blacks always claim when the truth is published about their pathological community?</p>
<p>Are Latinos leeches and welfare parasites according to Facts, many of which are from government sources?  Saying Latinos are not leeches and parasites is a lie, and a damned one at that.</p>
<p>Maybe you could come up one or two positive things about Latinos because, frankly, I couldn&rsquo;t. Maybe you could come up with a reason to import more of a population that is turning the US into a third world ghetto, and quickly.</p>
<p>But, above all, we, the American-born white population, have a right to know what is in store for us, which is the same as for you:  destruction and elimination.</p>

		<p>This sort of &#8220;debate filtering&#8221; isn&rsquo;t just limited to news sites, either.  I was recently thrown off a Japanese anime website for &#8220;posting racist comments.&#8221;  Nothing inflammatory or insulting, just a reasoned response to some multiculti propaganda.</p>
<p>And of course, anti-White comments are <i>never</i> considered Racist, so with all the pro-White postings filtered out, the prevailing tone <i>appears</i> to be pro-Diversity.<br>

		<p>Well, IMO, Whites simply pull down their pants, and assume the position by bending over to clutch their ankles when they bleat out that they have no problem whatsoever with LEGAL immigration, it&rsquo;s ILLEGAL immigration they have a problem with.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the equivalent of opening the door and inviting the vampire into your living room.  Since most of our LEGAL immigrants are poor, Non-White and unskilled, then what is your excuse for insisting that these poor, hard-working (SOB!) people of color pony up money they do not have to go through the time, trouble and expense of coming her legally?!  You heartless swine!</p>
<p>The point Whites are missing is that we have enough poor, unskilled AMERICANS who can do the grunt work.  The country is filled with millions of unemployed skilled and semi-skilled, the goddam boat is swamped and we don&rsquo;t need ANYONE here who is not bringing in an exceptional skill that isn&rsquo;t available anywhere in the country or a ton of wealth that will generate a lot of jobs for Americans.</p>
<p>For that reason, I am opposed to ALL immigration unless those two criteria or meant.  I am opposed to ALL amnesty or offering any refugee sanctuary, etc.  I want ALL temporary work visas suspended.  I want e-verify mandated as the law of the land, draconian fines lodged against any company hiring or landlord housing illegal aliens and all social benefits cut off to any family here (legally or not) whose adults were not born here.  I don&rsquo;t care if they popped out a couple of brats or not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to tell these damned people that the boat is swamped and taking in water. It is not time to start taking in more passengers; it is time to start bailing and, if necessary, making quite a few problems walk the plank.</p>

		<p>I have noticed that increasingly papers censor the comments in articles on race and immigration (the articles themselves are always pro illegal immigration, pro anti-white discrimination, and so on).  Often comments are disabled completely.  The &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; haven&rsquo;t been able to censor the internet as a whole but they do their best to keep a lid on the websites they control directly.</p>

		<p>22 WR the elder: Whenever you see that the comments are closed for an article, it&rsquo;s because too many people wrote truthfully and intelligently on race or immigration.  They hope to prevent the so-far uninformed from running across something that actually makes sense.  Personally, I enjoy seeing them run away like that.  I&rsquo;ve never seen a multi-cultist actually stand and defend their position rationally.  All they have to argue with are lies and censorship. </p>
