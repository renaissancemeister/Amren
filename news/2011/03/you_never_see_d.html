			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jennifer Madison, Daily Mail (London), March 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two top Indian models have spoken out against what they believe is racism against darker-skinned women in the country&rsquo;s fashion industry.</p>
<p>Dipannita Sharma and Carol Gracias say they are losing out on top jobs because an increasing amount of Indian designers are casting lighter-skinned models.</p>
<p>Ms Sharma said that the whole country was so &#8216;obsessed&rsquo; with fair skin, that a shift in attitude would take years.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old, who is also a television star, told The Telegraph: &#8216;It&rsquo;s not just the fashion industry, India per se is obsessed with white skin.</p>
<p>&#8216;We will take another hundred years to completely get over it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She continued: &#8216;The industry doesn&rsquo;t openly agree that preferring foreign models over Indian models just for the skin tone is racism. It has some kind of fairness obsession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;One could have understood, if it was about getting supermodels of international fame or to work in India but that&rsquo;s not happening, it&rsquo;s just they want fairer skin on the Indian ramps.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Gracias echoed her fellow model in an interview with the Hindustan Times.</p>
<p>She revealed that she makes just $1,000 per runway show compared to top international models like Kate Moss and Adriana Lima, who can command between  $20,000 and $150,000.</p>
<p>She explained: &#8216;The major reason for this wide gap is that Indian models are not valued so much when it comes to commercial projects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8216;You never see a dark-skinned girl on TV ads and that&rsquo;s where the lucrative work is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everyone uses fair-skinned girls, people use skin-lighteners like Fair and Lovely. I don&rsquo;t  &mdash;  maybe I would have been fair and lovely by now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pranab Awasti, of Delhi&rsquo;s Glitz Modelling agency, attributed the controversial issue to the country&rsquo;s 200-year history under British colonial rule. </p>
<p>He told the Hindustan Times: &#8216;Indians in general have that inferiority complex, we have had a hangover about fair skin, since the British left India. </p>
<p>&#8216;The idea of fairness is an Indian concept and it needs to change. It is an inherent thing in Indians to see white as beautiful and black as ugly &hellip;  we have this concept in our minds that only fair-skinned people can be models.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Others argue in an industry that worships size-zero, skin colour is not an issue and most local models are simply too curvy to make the cut.</p>
<p>Runway choreographer Tanya Lefebvre said: &#8216;The girls are not tall enough and have varying body shapes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Skin lightening controversy is not new for the Indian fashion industry. </p>
<p>Editors of Elle India were accused digitally lightening the skin colour of Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan for the magazine&rsquo;s December 2010 issue, reigniting the decades-long debate.</p>

		<p>How true!</p>
<p>I recently ate at an Indian restaurant, and they were showing  Bollywood videos. The girls in the videos looked very Caucasian, Mediterranean perhaps, and the young man was an Indian version of John Travolta.</p>
<p>Many had brown hair and light brown eyes. </p>
<p>This contrasted severely with our Indian servers, who were very dark.</p>
<p>The dances were interesting, subtle.. .  for a while. Then, after several Disney-type videos, they started doing Beyonce-type gyrations and I was disgusted.</p>
<p>All the videos were actually quite banal, with much dancing and very little plot, that I could tell. </p>

		<p>C&rsquo;mon folks. Neither of the two pictured is very dark. The problem is that neither of them is very attractive especially the one on the left.<br/>

		<p>The famous self-censorship invoked by Whites on dating sites proves that Taylor is right that the White American majority that stated they have no preference for living among their own is mostly lying. Indians dont have that problem and a light skinned Indian girl is much more confident about it, even a fat one.  The bigest myth of Modernity is that black/brown skin isn&rsquo;t a curse, to say nothing of the other traits that accopany it. Thank GOD I&rsquo;m White!</p>

<p>America, on the other hand, is obsessed with non-white skin.</p>
<p>Notice how most all of advertising depicts non-whites in t.v. ads, posters and even advertising pamphlets?  I&rsquo;m in a rural area and received an advertising flier for a water conditioner with a picture of a family of dark Arabs or Indians, or Pakis, I&rsquo;m not sure which.  This area is 99% pure honky.</p>
<p>Ad posters around the wall of our drugstore is of dark-haired, tan or brown people.  The ads at the local Sears is the same, with the bed department showing a large poster on the wall of a light brown Indian lying in bed with a very OBVIOUSLY WHITE WOMAN.</p>
<p>The advertising industry is rife with multicultural dregs who are training us to believe the entire country is non-white.  It&rsquo;s their sick way of doing their part to get us to better accept their rainbow utopia.</p>
<p>That most of these ad people are white is truly amazing and disgusting as well.  We have MANY traitors and fools in our population.</p>

		<p>Modeling is a private business, and like any other business, it has to sustain a profit to remain viable.  Furthermore, something very subjective, like beauty, is a bona fide reason for discrimination.  So if the Indian modeling industry thinks that (a) its customers want to see a lighter skinned model, and (b) they can maximize profits by doing so, then there is simply no basis for objection.  How one &#8220;feels&#8221; about it is too bad.</p>

<p>I wonder what sort of media propaganda campaign will ensue in India as they attempt to change perceptions?  It doesn&rsquo;t work. After at least 30 years of awarding some one other than a white, blued blonde numerous beauty titles, nearly every successful dark man in the world seems to go to Northern Europe to find a wife.</p>

		<p>Being a dark skinned Indian, I couldn&rsquo;t care less if there are dark skinned models in India. I do care that we have skin dark enough easily be mistaken for black by Americans yet we are the highest achieving ethnic group in America which provides SOLID proof that Blacks aren&rsquo;t being held back by their skin color. I think there should be more studies done comparing dark skinned children of Indian immigrants vs. Blacks with the same skin color comparing achievement level, crime rates, adjustment, etc.</p>
<p>NOW that would provide some interesting results&hellip;..</p>

<p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s all the fault of those evil British (and notice that, as usual, no counter-argument is given to this claim).</p>
<p>The reality is that recognition of color differences in India goes all the way back to the beginning of the caste system and long predates British rule. But it&rsquo;s all right to blame it all on the British, since they were white.</p>

		<p>My God, how can this be news?</p>
<p>More than two thousand years of Indian History- very well chronicled, explains with great detail, how Indian society has from the beginning, been plotted on SKIN COLOR.</p>
<p>The Ruling warrior and Priest classes were Indo-Europeans, and fair skinned.<br/>
At the bottom, the &#8220;Panchamas,&#8221; the black Indian aborigines, were the meat- slaughterers&hellip;and the untouchables.<br/>

		<p>It is not so easy to dramatically lighten one&rsquo;s skin color without going to extreme and risky Michael Jackson-type measures, but Indians are very fond of milder lighteners and sun blocks.  They also go for contact lens that lighten the color of their eyes.  When needed they get nose jobs to make their noses less broad.  And I am not talking about Bollywood starlets here, but regular middle class Indians   &mdash;   male and female   &mdash;   some of whom live in America and some of whom live in India.</p>
<p>Really I have only seen two Indians who could pass for White without these measures.  This upsets the Indians that look like African Americans (at first glance) and is knocked by the lighter skinned too, but it is still very common. </p>

India&rsquo;s endeavor for lighter skin dates back thousands of years before they were visited by the British.</p>
<p>Light skin is important to Indias upper classes because the knowledge that formed the basis of their occult beliefs originated from their interracial relationship with the original white tribe.</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s upper caste believes that if they maintain light skin then they will be preserving the knowledge they inherited from the lost white tribe.</p>
<p>In all respects, they are correct.</p>
<p>However, the fact of the matter doesnt sit well with modern Indian youth because they are part of a new wave of multiculturalism permeating Europe and America and often see the truth for themselves in the fact that whites are more beautiful, more powerful, more intelligent and more humble to accept them in the age old manner of multiculturalism which clearly carries far less merit.</p>

		<p>  Sorry girls it will take more than a hundred years for Indians to get over their obsession with fair skin. This preference is not new but an enduring Indian tradition  India was conquered several times by light skinned peoples from the North, and India has inherited the preferences of their oppressors. As light skin is somewhat scarce on the Indian subcontinent. it is highly valued. I&rsquo;ve personally seen this in Indian families where lighter skinned children or grandchildren are the family favorites.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all about attitude.  I have met many, many East Indians in my life and pretty much all of them were charming, thoughtful people.  I suspect this is a bit superficial, a way of gaining entrance, but regardless of that, it is first impressions we are talking about.  Blacks consistently get straight into your face, have huge attitude problems and if they are &#8220;charming,&#8221; it is so blatantly manipulative that it is insulting to one&rsquo;s intelligence.</p>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s all the fault of the British, how come all those Indian paintings that predate the British show the princesses as white?</p>
<p>Did the British come in such numbers to settle in India that every little village girl in every far off place saw a pretty white women and felt sad?  No.  The only British people that were there were some 30,000 soldiers, mostly on the coast in a few places, and a few traders and aristocrats here and there.  The Brits ruled through native client rulers.  Most Indians never even saw a Brit over that 200 years.</p>

		<p>The fashion industry champions slim builds.  They champion full, perky breasts.  They champion blondes and brunettes.  They champion pretty faces, with high cheekbones!  So why is it a problem that the fashion industry champions fair skin?  It is, in most peoples&rsquo; opinion, more attractive than darker skin.</p>
<p>This article reminds me of that fatty &#8220;Monique,&#8221; who tried to get the whole &#8220;plus-sized models&#8221; thing going.  I&rsquo;m so glad that never caught on.  Fat models?  Oh please, there is nothing more disturbing or un-natural than a 400-pound ball of lard waddling down a runway.</p>
