<h1>College Degrees Won&rsquo;t Shield Blacks from Unemployment</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jean McGianni Celestin, The Root, March 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For years, Americans have been told that going to college was the best protection against unemployment. That hasn&rsquo;t been the case for African Americans during the Great Recession, with a jobless rate nearly double that of their white counterparts. And experts say the gap could widen in the slow recovery.</p>
<p>Black Americans have long suffered the highest unemployment rate of any ethnic group in the country, and this recession has only exacerbated a long-standing divergence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the end of 2010, black Americans, 25 years old and older, with a college education had an unemployment rate of 7.3 percent, while the rate for white college graduates was 4.2 percent, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Other minority groups, such as Asian college graduates and Hispanics, hover a shade over 5.5 percent, while the rate for blacks was expected to continue climbing.</p>
<p>Cary Fraser, a professor of labor and industrial relations at Penn State University, believes that several factors contribute to high unemployment in the black community.</p>
<p>First, as corporations continue to relocate thousands of jobs to lower-cost markets in more rural areas, many of the opportunities that were once available to black workers in metropolitan centers are now nonexistent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The second factor in high joblessness among blacks is what Fraser describes as &#8220;class-origin distinction.&#8221; He says that a large number of black professionals are first-generation college graduates who don&rsquo;t have the same kinds of networks as an earlier generation of African Americans. &#8220;They&rsquo;re just not as savvy and as prepared for the work force when they leave college as the older generation was.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Fraser also believes that internal politics play a considerable role in higher black unemployment rates, saying that some companies become less inclined to hire minorities once their respective diversity-hiring goals have been met.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lurie Daniel-Favors, a New York-based civil rights and consumer-debt attorney, says that this damaging cycle has been going on for a while, even before the current labor crisis. Black Americans have always been in a recession when it comes to jobs, and she points to a structural and systematic institutionalized racism as the primary driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks have always been the last hired and the first fired,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Countless studies have shown that when all other things are equal, if two résumés have equal qualifications and the only difference is the ethnicity of the names of the candidates, potential employers will go with the name that sounds the most European  &mdash;  or the least ethnic.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I heard that Africa is ranked among the world&rsquo;s lowest literacy rates. That continent needs all the college graduates it can get.</p>
<p>Perhaps these unemployed people (black or white) can put their Bachelor of Arts (not Science) Degrees in Multicultural and Diversity Studies to good use.</p>
<p>Yes, that degree really does exist.</p>

		<p>So much ink spilled, so much anguished hand-wringing to avoid the obvious: far too many blacks graduate from colleges simply as Affirmative Action quota-fillers, and have little real competence in their ostensible fields.</p>
<p>Is there some federal agency whose sole task is to dig through all available statistics to find the latest pseudo-shocking &#8220;gap&#8221; between blacks and everyone else?  No, I suppose that academics are quite capable of doing the job all by themselves.</p>

		<p>Gosh, what a surprise! I&rsquo;ll bet Lockheed-Martin hires more engineers for their product development efforts than English majors.</p>
<p>Two factors work against black college graduates:  One, too many of them hold degrees useless for any type of endeavor, except holding a make-work government job. Two, even those who do have a more conventional degree of some work-related relevance are fighting an uphill battle due to black grade inflation and the sure knowledge by the employer that if the candidate doesn&rsquo;t work out getting rid of a non-performing black will almost invariably be a long, arduous, and very expensive proposition.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, many of them are hired and carried on a quota basis, especially by companies which rely on government contracts to any significant degree. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m wondering how much of this is due to affirmative action lowering the value of degree&rsquo;s held by Blacks? With the overwhelming pressure to graduate more Blacks, universities have a HUGE incentive to lower the bar. Employers know this and can&rsquo;t afford to take chances on degrees of questionable merit.</p>

<p>There is a little deception in this oft-repeated story. What was done is the original study is that resumes from fictional male applicants with equal credentials were sent out. All of them included information that indirectly indicated that the applicant was black, such as club memberships or the like. Some of the applicants had names suggesting middle class origins. Others had names suggesting &#8220;ghetto&#8221; or underclass origins   &mdash;   such as names starting with &#8220;la&#8221; &#8220;le&#8221; or &#8220;der&#8221; and the like.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the resume with the &#8220;middle class&#8221; names got a better response. In the retelling, the furniture in this story got moved around a little. </p>
<p>Over a long period of time, these names have lost their shock value and gained some acceptance. But I doubt that those born with these distinctly lower class monikers who make good in life will bestow the same on their children.</p>
<p>Do note that there is some substance to the issue however. It was also noted that ethnic names could hurt applicants as well.</p>

		<p>&#8220;College Degrees Won&rsquo;t Shield Blacks from Unemployment&#8221;</p>
<p>Why should AA degrees be taken seriously, especially when the recipients aren&rsquo;t any more capable than a high school graduate?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as I said before:  When the economy worsens the first to be laid off or find it hard to find jobs will be the black affirnmative action crowd.</p>
<p>They were awarded degrees when they weren&rsquo;t qualified; they were given jobs as part of corporate AA programs, when money was coming in in huge amounts, but now the freebies are over.  Black incompetents can no longer be kept on the payroll under the pretense they&rsquo;re contributing to the betterment of the business, rather than being a charity case, and no one can afford to hire a black with a worthless AA degree and pretend he/she is competent.</p>
<p>Sorry, but the party&rsquo;s over, folks.</p>

<p>This paragraph:<br>
&#8220;The second factor in high joblessness among blacks is what Fraser describes as &ldquo;class-origin distinction.&rdquo; He says that a large number of black professionals are first-generation college graduates who don&rsquo;t have the same kinds of networks as an earlier generation of African Americans. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re just not as savvy and as prepared for the work force when they leave college as the older generation was.&rdquo;<br>
Makes absolutely no sense to me, whatsoever. Worse than that, it left me downright confused.<br>
This guy is saying that today&rsquo;s black professionals fare worse than black professionals of previous generations because they were the first of their families to go to college. Right? Then he says that they aren&rsquo;t as savvy and ready for the work force when they leave college that the previous generation did. Right? <br>
But I thought they just said that the older generations didn&rsquo;t go to college. I&rsquo;m confused. <br>
 <br>
Can someone tell me if it was:<br>
1. The authors bad grammer<br>
2. My exhaustion addled brain<br>
   or<br>
3. The person quoted was just talking your average black nonsense</p>
<p>If this guy did, in fact, mean that the older generation didn&rsquo;t go to college, yet was still more savvy and work force ready, just where and how did these previous generations of uneducated blacks gain these networking skills? Hanging out on the stoop in the ghetto?</p>

<p>No mention of performance, punctuality, or morale effects on other employees.  At the place I was working when this &#8220;Great Recession&#8221; began, the employees that DID NOT take 1.5hr lunches, come in 30min late daily, and/or would constantly be rude to all around them, were not let go.  Those that were guilty of these offenses were.  One black co-worker, who incidentally had been using threatening violent language as a matter of speech, was laid off said to me &#8220;Good people should not be treated like this.&#8221;  To which I replied &#8220;Good employees don&rsquo;t use muthafu**uh when speaking to clients/customers.&#8221;  He just looked at me perplexed, as if he had never thought that upper management had invested their resources in him, and in return he called their customers &#8220;dawg.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I guess Ms Daniel-Favors never look at factors such as those.  At times, the elementary brain of the American black is astounding.  This &#8220;civil rights advocate&#8221; only sees people in terms of color, which is what she claims to be against.  What a sad and crossed way to lead a life.  </p>

		<p>As someone who has had the pleasure of working with dozens of college educated blacks over the last quarter century I can tell you one thing, the degrees they get are worthless.  They can not put together a coherent, declarative sentence.  You must explain the same thing over and over and over again.  Many of them continue to speak Ebonics long after getting their degrees.  Foreign-born college education Hispanics generally have a better command of the language.   Their work habits are poor.  They have the attention span of a gnat.  They complain about being overworked even when they have nothing to do.  They are rude and nasty, even to each other and play the race card whenever they do not get their way.  They even accuse other blacks of discriminating against them!  It is frustrating to work with them.</p>
<p>I have learned one thing from working with blacks: patience!<br>

		<p>there are so many things that cannot be stated or talked about it a truthful manner&hellip; somehow, the definition of racism, which should be that races might be inherently different, is thought of as unspeakable.  <br>
a sad state of affairs&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  that is a large reason for the clammoring of repubs/teapartiers to nominate Herman Cain&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;  we want our own black in the white house.<br>
Our culture has conveniently beaten down white men enough that most are unelectable except as paper pushing wimps.<br>
so to the point of black college graduates having trouble getting or staying employed; well, yes, but we had better not really discuss this too thoroughly&hellip;..  dangerous territory</p>

<p><br>
Three innocent explanations for this discrepancy come readily to mind:</p>
<p>1) The risk-of-lawsuit factor: The cost of hiring a protected minority is higher because it carries the associated higher risk of litigation if the employee must later be dismissed.</p>
<p>2) The disparity in the quality of the college degrees granted to whites vs blacks. Blacks take easier majors. &#8220;For the past three decades black and female college students have consistently been over represented in education, humanities and the social sciences. These fields offer lower incomes for B. A. degree recipients than the natural and technical sciences.&#8221; (College Major and Career Inequality: Implications for Black Students,&#8221; Gail E. Thomas, Johns Hopkins University, Journal of Negro Education, Vol. 54, No. 4, 1985)<br>
https://www.jstor.org/pss/2294714</p>
<p>3) The risk a black college graduate&rsquo;s skills be inadequate. Black graduates&rsquo;s skill may not compare favorably with those of a white college graduate   &mdash;  - all credentias things equal   &mdash;  - due to much lower standards for college admission at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  See, for example, &#8220;Is Racial Preference Unfair?&#8221; 2001, by Linda Chavez on the effect of racial preferences on medical school admissions:<br>

		<p>While this article is interesting, it really doesn&rsquo;t prove much of anything.</p>
<p>Any decent researcher knows that to come up with a true conclusion that black college graduates are not getting hired as much as white students (or others for that matter), you must at least control for such things as type of degree, and GPA.</p>
<p>For example, it may be that blacks are majoring in lots of degrees that are easier, but less marketable.  For example perhaps a lot of them major in &#8220;black studies&#8221;.</p>
<p>To conclude blacks are not getting hired as much as whites, you&rsquo;d have to just look at, say black accounting degree recipients vs white accounting degree recipients.  </p>
<p>My guess is that, once you control for degree and GPA you would find that the white unemployment rate greatly exceeded the black unemployment due to government programs such as Affirmative Action.</p>
<p>Right now I am a white college professor who will become unemployed on May 16.  I have applied to about 30 universities at this time but no one seems interested&hellip;..I believe that if I were black with the same exact resume, the phone would be ringing off the wall with all of the universities wanting to hire me&hellip;&hellip;.That&rsquo;s not the way it is suppose to be in this so called land of equal opportunity! </p>

		<p>For many years I did the recruiting and hiring for a large national corporation. These was always pressure on me from my superiors to find and hire qualified blacks. Sounds easy doesn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s not even with college degrees many of the black applicants could barely write their own names or read a book.<br>
Affirmative Action had given some of these people not just bachelors but Masters and Phd. degrees, it was shocking an pathetic. How would you like a doctor operating on you who could barely read a book or even understand what the book was saying? Now they want to spread this disease to many other area&rsquo;s including the military and it is frightening to me. How about you?</p>

		<p>I have a few explanations for this. </p>
<p>Blacks go to college and get African American degrees and try to get jobs as accountants, stock brokers, teachers, bankers,etc.  An AA degree is not a business degree.</p>
<p>Blacks show up to interviews in sagging jeans and Air Jordans.  Even if the job is a very professional one, they dress like that.</p>
<p>In my undergrad and grad school classes EVERY SINGLE black dropped any class that was halfway difficult.  I honestly have never seen a black on the day of a final exam in a difficult class, hence the AA degrees.</p>
<p>What is the percentage of blacks that GRADUATE compared to the rest of their demographic.  Blacks are 13% of the population, if 20% of all blacks get college degrees and only 10% of graduates get business degrees, that is 2% of blacks.  Are there more than 2% of blacks in the corporate world?  </p>
<p>Get the picture?</p>

If I have two equal resumes in front of me, one with the name Shaniqua Washington and one with the name Susan Watson  &mdash;  guess who I&rsquo;m going to call for an interview?<br>
Same goes for two  young men, one named De&rsquo;Sha&rsquo;wn&rsquo;t&rsquo;avius Jackson and one named David Wellington. <br>
Sorry, Shaniqua and Deshawntavious (apostophes and all), I&rsquo;m pretty sure half your resume is faked, and the other half was gotten through affirmative action, and either one of you will be more trouble than you&rsquo;re worth as an employee  &mdash;  and God help me if I ever want to fire one of you&hellip; </p>

<p>Blacks are only the last hired if the company isn&rsquo;t a government agency, or some other large corporation that needs to diversify.</p>
<p>Blacks are the first to be fired, because they are the first to cause 10x the problems as non-blacks. If they only caused the same amount of problems and did the same amount of work as whites, they wouldn&rsquo;t get fired. The same goes for getting laid off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Countless studies have shown that when all other things are equal,&#8221; and the white man scores better on a qualification or entrance exam, they will still hire the black, or claim the exams were unfair.</p>

		<p>OK, folks, let&rsquo;s get honest.  If you&rsquo;ve got a choice between a black dentist and a Jewish dentist, or an Asian dentist, who you gonna go to?  The Jewish dentist, right?  A no brainer.  The fact is, everybody suspects that black professionals only got to where they are because of Affirmative Action   &mdash;   and idiots like that fool who &#8220;treated&#8221; Michael Jackson only confirm the suspicions   &mdash;   and while that may not always be true, it IS the general perception.  It&rsquo;s fairly easy to accept a black plumber or electrician, but a black doctor, lawyer, or CPA?  Nope.  I&rsquo;ll take the Jewish professional over any of &#8216;em.  That may upset some of you, but, well, tough.  My own experience - and I&rsquo;m 65 yrs old - has taught me that this is the wisest course.</p>

		<p>what is the average IQ of white college graduate?</p>
<p>what is the average IQ of a black college graduate?</p>
<p>is a black with an IQ of 90 (100, 110, 120, 130, etc.) more or less likely to be unemployed than a white having the same IQ?</p>
<p>matched for IQ, are blacks more likely to be unemployed than whites?</p>
<p>none of these questions have been answered by the MSM, but the answers to all have been known for decades:</p>
<p>matched for IQ, blacks with IQs above 100 or so are LESS - and not more - likely to be unemployed than whites, because blacks with IQs above a hundred or are relatively rare, and are in demand to fill quotas in the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>blacks probably do face discrimination in hiring, and many competent blacks are probably a suspicion unjustly because of the grotesque psychological and intellectual deficits of the vast majority of blacks.</p>
<p>meanwhile, American society as a whole discriminates systematically in favor of blacks, not against them, in education and employment.</p>
<p>it is common knowledge to all working Americans that incompetent blacks occupy quota positions in all walks of life because it is cheaper and easier to comply with the regs by paying an expensive seat warmer than to be taken to court by the feds.</p>
<p>blacks face the obstacle of disastrously low cognitive ability, and everyone has always known it. </p>
<p>that is why a black college graduate has low employment prospects: because of race quotas in education, no one believes his degree is worth the paper it&rsquo;s printed on.</p>

		<p>Years ago, when I was in college, I noticed an interesting phenomenom.  Blacks were well represented in the core classes and easy classes such as Sociology.  When I got into my major, I might have one or two blacks in my Accounting and Finance classes.  </p>
<p>Simply put, if you&rsquo;re looking to hire an accountant, that degree in African American Studies isn&rsquo;t going to help much - no matter how much the company tries to hire &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I would have to say that one of the biggest reasons for black college graduate unemployment would be that the majority of degrees would be in things like &#8220;black studies&#8221; or some other puff course. With AA the way it is if a black student had the intellegence to achieve a degree in engineering, or other hard science he or she would be guaranteed a good job- ahead of any other race. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Blacks have always been the last hired and the first fired,&rdquo; </p>
<p>I worked for one of the big 3 in an office type setting many years ago.  There was a black fellow there named Jerome.  He was a very nice guy but DUMB AS A ROCK.  He talked slow, walked slow, was always sleepy at work.   He was a walking stereo-type.  </p>
<p>A white manager was about to fire him for incompetence when a black manager stopped her.  The black manager had Jerome come and work for him.  Instead of being fired, he was promoted months later.  Did Jerome change?  Nope, he became a token.</p>
<p>The black manager (Darnell) that promoted Jerome never promoted white males and everyone knew it.  He would promote white women, Hispanics, blacks but not white males.  The other white managers noticed what Darnell was doing.  So Darnell&rsquo;s managers &#8220;promoted&#8221; Darnell to technical group which required a higher degree of education and expertise with engine systems.  Guess who worked in the technical group!  ALL WHITE MALES.  So, Darnell HAD to promote white males since that was all that worked for him. Myself and fellow workers  always believed  that was done on purpose to teach Darnell a lesson.   Darnell&rsquo;s &#8220;promotion&#8221; was really a lateral move and we all knew it.   </p>
<p>Last I heard, Darnell was no longer with the company.  Fired for sexual harassment of a white woman. <br>

		<p>Having a college degree sounds good but you also have to consider the college attended and the degree held by the person looking for work. </p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for government hiring and affirmative action you would see how well blacks do in a &#8220;free market economy&#8221;. </p>

When I  asked him why he told me that EVERYTHING was given to him free by the cafeteria ladies. When I asked what the story on THAT was, he said that the lunch ladies were trying to snag a good husband propect and pulling out all the stops. As he put it, &#8220;To a cafeteria lady, an electrician IS a professional man&hellip;&#8221; </p>

<p>Where are all these black electricians or plumbers, Tim?</p>
<p>Owning a marine construction company, I&rsquo;ve encountered only one  black electrician or plumber.  He was an electrician that COULD do the job of wiring new homes, but he was working under his uncle&rsquo;s license, so I don&rsquo;t know if he couldn&rsquo;t pass the tests required for certification or he might have had a criminal record that would disqualify him.</p>
<p>He was a rarity, at least in my neck of the woods where PLENTY of black live.</p>

How about the creative White  inventive ratio versus the black creativity; what is the ratio there ? I would hate to embellish the actual numbers but it has to be a ridiculously high number just based on reading who has started business and industry from the ground -up all my upper-middle aged life.</p>

<p>Discrimination is not a bad word.  I would much rather be around whites all day than blacks, regardless of the professional competence.  It&rsquo;s much less stressful and much more enjoyable.  I wish the decent blacks the best, but I just like my own kind.</p>

It&rsquo;s probably safe to say that her Hispanic brethern are engaged in the same sort of behavior as well. After all, we didn&rsquo;t get to the stage where we  have &#8220;press one for English, press two for Spanish,&#8221; having spanish become the official language of Miami Florida and Los Angles, California. I could go on. The fact that is somewhat dishonest and disingenous for your Hispanic friend to be complaning about Blacks or anyone else given the fact that Hispanics have aggressively and arrogantly muscled ther way into turning our nation into an americanized version of Mexico.</p>
<p>Say what you want to about Blacks (and I certainly have my complaints) the fact is that Blacks have never been as much of a threat to our native White culture as Hispanics. If you do not believe me, just think about some of the examples I gave. </p>

		<p>Almost all blacks with college degrees work for either government or taxpayer funded &#8220;non-profit&#8221; groups.  But affirmative action finger has changed and only hispanics, asians and diversity whites such as arabs and central asians are now eligible for government and non profit jobs.</p>
<p>I love it.  After 30 years of dealing with the surly incompetent blacks whenever I had dealings with any and all government agencies I can now deal with competent civilized hispanics, asians, arabs whatever.</p>
