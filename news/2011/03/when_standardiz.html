			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jack Gillum and Marisol Bello, USA Today, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In just two years, Crosby S. Noyes Education Campus went from a school deemed in need of improvement to a place that the District of Columbia Public Schools called one of its &#8220;shining stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Standardized test scores improved dramatically. In 2006, only 10% of Noyes&rsquo; students scored &#8220;proficient&#8221; or &#8220;advanced&#8221; in math on the standardized tests required by the federal No Child Left Behind law. Two years later, 58% achieved that level. The school showed similar gains in reading.</p>
<p>Because of the remarkable turnaround, the U.S. Department of Education named the school in northeast Washington a National Blue Ribbon School. Noyes was one of 264 public schools nationwide given that award in 2009.</p>
<p>Michelle Rhee, then chancellor of D.C. schools, took a special interest in Noyes. She touted the school, which now serves preschoolers through eighth-graders, as an example of how the sweeping changes she championed could transform even the lowest-performing Washington schools. Twice in three years, she rewarded Noyes&rsquo; staff for boosting scores: In 2008 and again in 2010, each teacher won an $8,000 bonus, and the principal won $10,000.</p>
<p>A closer look at Noyes, however, raises questions about its test scores from 2006 to 2010. Its proficiency rates rose at a much faster rate than the average for D.C. schools. Then, in 2010, when scores dipped for most of the district&rsquo;s elementary schools, Noyes&rsquo; proficiency rates fell further than average.</p>
<p>A USA TODAY investigation, based on documents and data secured under D.C.&rsquo;s Freedom of Information Act, found that for the past three school years most of Noyes&rsquo; classrooms had extraordinarily high numbers of erasures on standardized tests. The consistent pattern was that wrong answers were erased and changed to right ones.</p>
<p>Noyes is one of 103 public schools here that have had erasure rates that surpassed D.C. averages at least once since 2008. That&rsquo;s more than half of D.C. schools.</p>
<p>Erasures are detected by the same electronic scanners that CTB/McGraw-Hill, D.C.&rsquo;s testing company, uses to score the tests. When test-takers change answers, they erase penciled-in bubble marks that leave behind a smudge; the machines tally the erasures as well as the new answers for each student.</p>
<p>In 2007-08, six classrooms out of the eight taking tests at Noyes were flagged by McGraw-Hill because of high wrong-to-right erasure rates. The pattern was repeated in the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years, when 80% of Noyes classrooms were flagged by McGraw-Hill.</p>
<p>On the 2009 reading test, for example, seventh-graders in one Noyes classroom averaged 12.7 wrong-to-right erasures per student on answer sheets; the average for seventh-graders in all D.C. schools on that test was less than 1. The odds are better for winning the Powerball grand prize than having that many erasures by chance, according to statisticians consulted by USA TODAY.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A trio of academicians consulted by USA TODAY  &mdash;  Haladyna, George Shambaugh of Georgetown University and Gary Miron of Western Michigan University  &mdash;  say the erasure rates found at Noyes and at other D.C. public schools are so statistically rare, and yet showed up in so many classrooms, that they should be examined thoroughly.</p>
<p>USA TODAY examined testing irregularities in the District of Columbia&rsquo;s public schools because, under Rhee, the system became a national symbol of what high expectations and effective teaching could accomplish. Federal money also was at play: Last year, D.C. won an extra $75 million for public and charter schools in the U.S. government&rsquo;s Race to the Top competition. Test scores were a factor.</p>
<p>USA TODAY initially looked at Noyes only because of its high erasure rates. Later, the newspaper found that Wayne Ryan, the principal from 2001 to 2010, and the school had been touted as models by district officials. They were the centerpiece of the school system&rsquo;s recruitment ads in 2008 and 2009, including at least two placed in Principal magazine.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There can be innocent reasons for multiple erasures. A student can lose his place on the answer sheet, fill in answers on the wrong rows, then change them when he realizes his mistake. And, as McGraw-Hill said in a March 2009 report to D.C. officials, studies also show that test-takers change answers more often when they are encouraged to review their work. The same report emphasizes that educators &#8220;should not draw conclusions about cheating behavior&#8221; from the data alone.</p>
<p>Haladyna notes, however, that when entire classrooms at schools with statistically rare erasures show fast-rising test scores, that suggests someone might have &#8220;tampered with the answer sheets,&#8221; perhaps after the tests were collected from students. Although not proof of cheating, such a case underscores the need for an investigation, he says.</p>
<p>At Noyes, USA TODAY found several grades with wide swings in their proficiency rates from one year to the next. In 2008, 84% of fourth-grade math students were listed as proficient or advanced, up from 22% for the previous fourth-grade class. The math scores for the fourth-grade class in 2010 dropped off to 52% proficient or better.</p>
<p>For the school as a whole, test scores seemed to ride a roller coaster: In reading, from 2006 through 2010, the annual percentage of all Noyes students testing as proficient or higher went from 24% to 44% to 62% to 84% to 61%, according to official records. Reading scores at all D.C. elementary schools slumped on average by 4 percentage points from 2009 to 2010; Noyes&rsquo; scores plunged 23 points.</p>

<p>They have a fancy legal term for that:  Fraud.  I&rsquo;m sure the Federal government would construe it as wire and mail fraud.  Since it happened in D.C., a Federal territory, no interstate commerce needs to have happened.<br>

Not to worry. Soon our glorious multi-CULT-ural nation will do away with all testing and use alternative methods to determine abilities:</p>

		<p>Anyone with even a basic knowledge of statistics can see the outright cheating and fraud. This is a total disgrace on so many levels.</p>
<p>Basic black corruption, for one, as teachers and administrators change test answers (I&rsquo;m surprised they actually filled in the correct circles) only to enrich themselves with bonus money from the white taxpayer.</p>
<p>And is there no embarrassment on the part of blacks that they have to do this? All of the time cheating and correcting papers could have gone for teaching. Also, the plan is so ill-conceived did they not know they would be caught?</p>
<p>And finally, the students. Already behind the eight ball with an average IQ of about 82 - these test scores will push them into new classes which might as well be taught by space aliens for all the students will learn - only increasing the dropout rate.</p>
<p>How long will this money-sucking waste of time trying to educate and then cover-up black failure continue?</p>

		<p>What a joke this country has become.  We are bankrupted; pandering to inferior genes with the consequence of dumbing down of everything from job performance, governing, and education; a $14 trillion and growing deficit due to government mismanagement; open borders equating to invasion by third world peoples; no real manufacturing industries; vast corruption at all three branches of government due to anything can be brought and influenced by money.  This country is steadily sliding downhill while the public is in denial or made to feel powerless, confused, and afraid due to the constant brainwashing by the media.     </p>

		<p>These schools typically already spend weeks teaching to the test, and still have to change scores. I do get it from a teacher perspective - if the test scores don&rsquo;t go up, out of a job, and a bad reference, but its still fraud. </p>

		<p>Noyes should be honored not pilloried by you white devils. During the last year hardly any teachers were robbed,raped,or murdered there. Math scores have always been high. Dealers rate the place four stars because it`s graduates can figure out how many rocks you can get from an eight-ball better than any other school this side of MIT. They have a special program where the 8th grade girls can have their babies with them and show the younger girls the benefits of early childhood development.<br>

		<p>Two Routes, same as always:</p>
<p>1.  Quietly get together White Super Majority states and then secede when the next moment of weakness arises, taking as many brilliant white minds, educational facilities, nuclear weapons and industry as you can to augment &#8216;middle American&rsquo; agro in a linear band of no-one-but-us-whites new nationality.</p>
<p>2.  Send in the clowns.  Errm, no, that&rsquo;s not it.  Yes!  Send in the Federally appointed, independent, testing teams with &#8216;any of three&rsquo; tests that are switched out with the actual standardized tests at the last second, to any school where &#8216;genius is sudden&rsquo;.  As opposed to innate with high term grades and work ethics (do the proofs on the paper and lots of essay work) to back it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that the statistics are surprising, it&rsquo;s that we are surprised.  There should be about a dozen different ways to sieve the results and show an impossible skew.  Lil&rsquo; Juaqine Jamille did not become a genius overnight&hellip;</p>
<p>And if that fails, move to discrete video monitoring and You Tube it.  Same as we did the Russians with naval communications traffic on that underwater cable.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t looking for shame.  We&rsquo;re looking for a reason to separate.</p>

		<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, no one changes the answers, but they do drill them to the test for basically the entire year - and 60% of the students still fail!  Many of our students cheat.  They look at other papers, or use their cell phones in the bathrooms to look up stuff on wikipedia.  This happens all the time. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true - if your job is dependent on shaquanda and pablo getting a 65% on a test (in reality 33% of the answers right) then of course you&rsquo;re going to teach to the test.</p>

		<p>I used to be a teacher and believe me, there is a heck of a lot of cheating on these tests.  </p>
<p>When I was in grad school, we were discussing this cheating issue in a class.  I innocently raised my had and said,  &#8220;why don&rsquo;t teachers just switch schools during testing so teachers do not test their own kids.  If they are not testing their own kids, they have little to no reason to cheat.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The professor stood there for a couple seconds with her mouth hanging open then said, &#8220;that is a brilliant idea, you should write that down and submit it to the district.&#8221;</p>
<p>I found it hard to believe that I was the only person to think of that.  They don&rsquo;t want the cheating to stop.  Many teachers are liberal, lying, leftist.  They don&rsquo;t want any change in education.    <br>
