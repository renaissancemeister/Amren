<h1>Commander Lambasts Modern Racism in US</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>FARS News Agency, Feb. 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Iran&rsquo;s Armed Forces Chief of Staff Major General Hassan Firouzabadi on Sunday strongly criticized the United States&rsquo; racial discrimination against the Indian and black Americans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Americans are the symbol of paradox and hypocrisy when it comes to the campaign against racism in the world. They are trying to brand themselves as the flag-bearer of democracy and human rights in the world but the realities in the US society as well as its brutal and criminal policies against the other nations and oppressed ethnic groups in different parts of the world prove this claim to be untrue,&#8221; Firouzabadi stated on Sunday. </p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Americans are the flag-bearers of modern racism,&#8221; he stressed, adding, &#8220;Although the US claims to be supporting democracy and human rights in the world, they have ignored the inalienable rights of a major segment of the country&rsquo;s population due to racism.&#8221; </p>
<p>He described the US administration&rsquo;s weak response to the damages caused by the Katrina Hurricane as an example of the US officials&rsquo; discrimination against the black Americans. </p>
<p>&#8220;The poor and the Black are second-class citizens in the eyes of the US leaders and these are only the white and rich Americans who enjoy the rights and advantages of first-class citizens,&#8221; the commander reiterated. </p>
<p>Also in another part of his statements, the Iranian chief military official called for comprehensive and joint efforts by all nations to end the ongoing injustice and discrimination in the world. <br>

		<p>Actually, I agree with the ignorant Iranian, but in a different respect.</p>
<p>The American government is indeed racist. However, the racism is directed at white people. Our government has implemented an immigration policy that will make us a minority in our own country. Further, our government practices racial discrimination in favor of non-whites at the expense of whites. This anti-white racial discrimination is eupemistically entitled affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Maybe this Iranian fool has been listening to Louis Walcott [Farrakhan] too much?</p>
<p>As we all know, they are the picture of racial harmony in Iran. So many different races all living together in total harmony. And the religious minorities too are so very happy. Why, everyone in Iran is so very happy. </p>
<p>Yes, I am sarcastic, but for good reason.</p>

		<p>Okay, Iran.  Think we&rsquo;re doing it wrong?  You can show us how it&rsquo;s done, and play us for the fools we&rsquo;ve been all along.  All you have to do is take in about 40 million black people.</p>
<p>Wanna lay odds that Hassan Firouzabadi has an account on Daily Kos?</p>

<p>Perhaps he should recall the U.S. support to his country following Iran&rsquo;s 2003 earthquake. </p>

		<p>They&rsquo;re just talking the way the white liberal elites, largely Americans, have taught them to talk and think of America. All of this demagoguery sounds like it came directly from the American lefties. And this type of rhetoric is supposed to make America loved and respected in the eyes of the world? </p>
<p>America was largely respected at the end ow WWII, but ill-advised military excursions on the part of the US and rhetoric like this from America&rsquo;s university professors have painted the US not as a beacon of democracy but as a jingoistic, racist and bigoted pool of &#8220;oppression&#8221; against nonwhites. This is one reason why America is now hated around the world.</p>

		<p>This hypocracy comes as no surprise to me&hellip;.let&rsquo;s not forget November 1979&hellip;the American hostages in Iran, some of whom, all black and/or female, were released early, due to their race and/or gender&hellip;.almost all the hostages held captive for 444 days were European-American men.  Ironic that an Iranian would accuse the U.S. of being racist when the Islamic Iranians are the most racist of them all.</p>

		<p>My guess is that this is a way to trick the useful idiots of US into liking Iran&rsquo;s regime. We are already seeing in the organized labor protests in Wisconsin signs that celebrate &#8216;solidarity with Egypt, et al.&rsquo; Who knows, this just might work.</p>

		<p>This is yet another reason why &#8220;diversity&#8221; is <i>not</i> a strength. Foreign enemies will incite ethnic conflict as a political strategy. Indeed, domestic enemies have been doing the same for generations.</p>

Thank you, Fred.  That is a very, VERY good point. They will seek to stir up trouble wherever they can find an opportunity. Diversity gives them one more opportunity.</p>
<p>And besides, it&rsquo;s not as if Iran doesn&rsquo;t have plenty of &#8220;diversity&#8221; of its own!</p>

		<p>I totally agree with the Commander. In fact, so much so that I believe the Indians and Blacks ought to have their very own new nation states. I think every White American would agree to contribute their tax dollars to a full scale resettlement program (without right of return) for our poor oppressed brothers&hellip;.oh say, somewhere in Iran. I&rsquo;m sure the Iranians will take much better care of them than our current free health care, free education, free housing, free food, and complete abdication of holding them to the rule of law, racists that we are.</p>

		<p>This is laughable!  A Major General in Iran&rsquo;s Armed Forces is going to lecture America on discrimination, human rights and civil liberties. Is this some kind of joke?  Hassan Firouzabadi needs to cancel his subscription to the Huffington Post and the New York Times and start paying attention to what&rsquo;s going on in his own country.</p>

		<p>The more I read about the shenanigans happening in the Middle East (Google &#8220;excerpts of Gaddafi&rsquo;s speech&#8221;) the more it is obvious that these are some darn low-IQ people, even their leaders (depending on how dark-skinned they are: a lot of Middle Eastern leaders could pass for European). </p>
<p>No wonder their modern borders were drawn up by Skykes and Picot in 1916 - they were too stupid to build nations themselves (and still are). </p>
<p>I really am tired of reading about how these Medieval throwbacks think that they are going to turn into Europe overnight, if they just go by the New York Times&rsquo; &#8220;democracy&#8221; playbook. </p>

		<p>Tim #7: Every war that the U.S. has been in, since World War II, has been a war for the U.N. </p>
<p>The U.S. has been bankrupted by occupying so many foreign bases, keeping these Nations &#8220;Free&#8221;, while our own borders are wide open. </p>
<p>It is all by design, and it is time people woke up to that fact. So plese visit <a href="https://www.jbs.org/" rel="nofollow">https://www.jbs.org</a> and look into joining the Society. Get your family and friends informed, and involved, too. </p>
