<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Either foreigners make an effort to become Danish or they can just stay away from Denmark, according to Søren Pind, the new immigration minister.</p>
<p>Only hours after taking over as immigration minister after Birthe Rønn Hornbech was fired yesterday, Pind declared himself ready to tighten up the immigration laws.</p>
<p>According to Pind, it should be set in stone that Denmark has room for foreigners that adopt and respect Danish values, norms and traditions; if they don&rsquo;t, they shouldn&rsquo;t be here at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I see it, when you choose Denmark, you choose Denmark because you want to become Danish,&#8221; Pind told Jyllands-Posten newspaper.</p>
<p>He highlighted a misunderstood notion of integration, where traditional Danish values have been compromised in an attempt to accommodate foreigners. This, he said, is a threat to Denmark as a nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my view, a mixture of cultures and the trails it carries with it makes the whole thing crackle, and I will do everything I can to fight that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This is great news for the Danish People&rsquo;s Party (DF). &#8220;There are several areas where tightening measures are needed, so Søren Pind&rsquo;s statement is definitely good for us to hear,&#8221; said DF&rsquo;s immigration spokesperson Peter Skaarup. </p>
<p>In the opposition, Socialist People&rsquo;s Party (SF) immigration spokesperson Astrid Kragh said that the nation is under threat if Søren Pind fails to realise that he needs to focus on high-priority tasks involving ghettos, education of non-ethnic youths and unemployment among foreigners.<br/>

Black immigrants usually have low IQs, so they frequently end up in prison, or on welfare. Muslim immigrants reject the values of the secular left. A high rate of third world immigration conflicts with everything else the left values. <br/>

		<p>Oh indeed Traitor Kragh!  Let us never put The Danes First in Denmark for Denmark belongs to The Hordes from The East!</p>
<p>Mr. Pind, </p>
<p>An immigrant can assimilate all they want but that still does not nor will it ever make them Danish.<br/>

		<p>While I think this man&rsquo;s comments are appropriate, they beg the question of why a nation such as Denmark allows any immigration at all, other than a trickle from other advanced European or North American nations.  If they indeed have a labor shortage it can be addressed through a guest worker program which specifies that all such workers enjoy a strictly limited term of residence and employment.</p>
<p>Immigration by culturally different foreigners is the path to national suicide. Only in America did it succeed, and then only because nearly all the immigrants were at least of European extraction and of Christian and Jewish faith.  Additionally, our period of mass immigration, long before the day of international air travel, meant that immigrants had made huge emotional and financial commitment to becoming Americans.  There was no 747 waiting to whisk them back from whence they came for an airfare equivalent to a few days wages. </p>

Whites will always suffer for their own politeness toward alien interlopers. </p>
<p>The truth is, Muslims and Africans shouldn&rsquo;t be in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>They may make minimal efforts to integrate so as to placate critics but they will always be foreigners. <br/>

		<p>Why can&rsquo;t Europe, North America and Australia all pull together and spend 1/2 the money on welfare and law enforcement and spend it on infrastructure to build up Africa, spend 1 generation teaching them as much as possible, just to incentivize them to stay there instead of here in Europe.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Integration&rsquo; is a bigger threat than multiculturalism. Integration takes whites and non-whites and declares, &#8220;you are one&#8221;.</p>
<p>The only option for whites is to not grant citizenship to non-whites, and to enforce repatriation of foreign nationals to their homelands.</p>
<p>Any discussion of &#8216;integration&rsquo; as an option must be nipped in the bud.</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight, Denmark, an overcrowded country, on a continent that has been packed to the gills with people for a thousand years- a place where virtually no one can afford a house-and new homes are rarely built&hellip;wants MORE PEOPLE?<br/>
And blacks or muslims, at that.<br/>
Look, I&rsquo;ll have whatever these people are drinking, because they&rsquo;re too high to feel any pain!<br/>

		<p>Fact is that immigration is being allowed by the ruling elites of Europe. Whatever politicians are saying to the contrary can be ignored as misinformation and spreading ambiguity.<br/>
 Without their active participation migration from Africa and Asia would not happen. The real question is why are these mass movements of people being actively supported and facilitated? One possible explanation is this is part of the plan to mix the people of Europe with so many foreigners that identity of the old kind that is allegiance to your country will be replaced by loyalty to the greater NEW Europe being created as we watch with unbelieving eyes. The new population of Europe will be the newcomers flooding in by the millions to create the amorphous mass of the not so far off future who will be more easily manipulated and controlled. The more diverse the population the less unity and feeling of oneness is to be found making divide and conquer the idea behind what is occurring today.<br/>

		<p>We in the US have had blacks in this country for what?  400 years?  And they are STILL NOT assimilated.  If anything, they are dragging more and more stupid whites into THEIR culture and away from ours.  Blacks CANNOT assimilate in a civilized country, because they simply are not civilized.  Period.  The &#8220;black problem&#8221; used to be mostly ours alone, with the only European exposure to the &#8220;problem&#8221; being in their colonies.<br/>
Now, for reasons that defy rationality, the European countries are having the same problems we have had to deal with for several hundred years - savage, third world races with no concept of morality, law, and civilization feeding out of the hand of those who built the civilizations, while biting those same hands and raping their daughters.<br/>
Whites, generally, when wanting something more were told to work harder.  Blacks and coloreds are told &#8220;they be entitled&#8221; and demand more, and more, and more.  Most whites work hard, or want to work.  Most blacks and coloreds don&rsquo;t want to work at all, or their &#8220;workplace&#8221; is the street corner pimping or selling drugs or working in &#8220;crews&#8221; to steal stuff from those who do work.  Welcome to OUR sorry world, Europe.  You deserve what you are getting.  You did not look across the ocean and take warning from what we have to deal with.  You pointed accusing fingers at us any time we spoke of the reality of the third world races, and thought you could do it better than we &#8220;racists&#8221;.  NOW you are seeing for yourselves these things and are yourselves becoming &#8220;racists&#8221;.  The White world better unite, stop pointing fingers at each other, give up the equality nonsense, and dispel the aliens from among us, or the White world is doomed with civilization also being doomed.<br/>
A whole world like Africa is the result if we DO NOT.</p>

		<p>Are you attracted to someone with dusky to dark skin, bad teeth, non-averaged (for whites) facial features, markedly dissimilar social customs and a past you cannot share because you -don&rsquo;t- know how bad their life was, or want to?</p>
<p>If you are not, they can never become you.  And you shouldn&rsquo;t dictate the rules by which they are forced to try.  Because the set of cultural memes that apply to you as loyalty enablers for living among us will be a lost cause for them.  They will not become more respected, likeable, employable or simply accepted in Western company for want of see-doing mimicry.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism and Egalitarianism and &#8216;Diversity&rsquo; is like the worlds&rsquo; greatest date-the-ugly-girl Frat Initiation that can only end tragically.</p>
<p>And this is why &#8216;the next step&rsquo; of becoming &#8216;more Dane like&rsquo;, is the real disaster in waiting.  Because any kids of mixed race will be effectively lost souls to both.</p>
<p>That these SWA cultures frequently have such horrific, vicious, and primitive cultural legacies only makes it all the more obvious why &#8216;breeding in&rsquo; is NEVER going to work when 10% of us are hard working, intelligent, sociable, whites.</p>
<p>And &#8216;the other 6.5 billion&rsquo; that is the ROW have so little to bring to any pairing in improving that condition.</p>
