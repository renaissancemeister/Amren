<h1><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42289646/ns/us_news-life/">Racial Remarks Spark Reprimand of Nevada Official</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSNBC, March 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Commissioners in central Nevada&rsquo;s Nye County have voted unanimously to reprimand the county assessor, after she sent emails to the sheriff questioning the citizenship of workers building a new county jail.</p>
<p>Assessor Shirley Matson asked for an investigation of the workers&rsquo; citizenship or work visa status in a March 11 email to Sheriff Tony DeMeo, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
<p>She wrote that her staff and the public &#8220;can plainly see that the construction employees are all Mexican/Latino non-English speaking and I&rsquo;m getting complaints.&#8221;</p>
<p>That email was among many between Matson and the sheriff, sent after Matson was elected to a four-year term in November. The sheriff told Matson her remarks were blatantly racist and her request was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>County commissioners agreed in a special meeting Friday that Matson violated the county&rsquo;s personal conduct policy. But they determined they could do little more than issue a public reprimand because she&rsquo;s an elected official.</p>
<p>Commissioner Dan Schinhofen said Matson&rsquo;s apparent viewpoint is: &#8220;They look Hispanic, so they must be illegal. Do you see where that could be seen as a bigoted statement? It&rsquo;s bigoted to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matson told commissioners it never dawned on her that her statements might be construed as racially insensitive. She said her email to DeMeo had nothing to do with the issue of illegal immigrants, but was an attempt to protect the county. She recounted working for a San Diego construction company that was fined millions of dollars for hiring illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>To have workers on a construction jobsite who may not be there legally not only poses a legal problem but also a safety problem when they can&rsquo;t communicate in English.</p>
<p>If one of these pople got hurt on the job for lack of understanding a verbal warning you can bet they would have been sued in more ways than one.</p>
<p>However, liberals never let facts get in the way of their agenda.</p>

		<p>Dollars to donuts she&rsquo;s right.  This happened in my neck of the woods.  Only it was a different reaction.  The unions noticed all these Spanish speaking Mexicans working on a federal project.  They complained and the situation was fixed immediately:</p>
<p>http://www.ktva.com/news/eye-team-investigates/-Investigation-Illegal-Workers-on-Elmendorf-AFB-115083389.html</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the County Commission&rsquo;s website with the Commissioner&rsquo;s emails who reprimanded the Assessor:</p>

<p><br>
Politely but firmly write them to tell them what you think about their reprimand.  (Don&rsquo;t mention it if you don&rsquo;t live in the County BTW!)</p>

		<p>I note that the Sheriff (who is supposed to uphold the law) never actually mentioned whether or not those workers are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>I think we can all draw our own conclusions from that.</p>

<p>In other words, the definition of &#8220;racist&#8221; is any desire to enforce the law.</p>
<p><i>Commissioner Dan Schinhofen said Matson&rsquo;s apparent viewpoint is: &ldquo;They look Hispanic, so they must be illegal. Do you see where that could be seen as a bigoted statement? It&rsquo;s bigoted to me.&rdquo;</i> </p>

I know an AR reader who once called to report a group of Hispanic men standing outside of a Home Depot. He told the police that he believed they might be illegals and they asked him, &#8216;why do you believe they&rsquo;re illegals?&rsquo; They wanted to shut him up by implying he was &#8216;racist&rsquo; and profiling. They didn&rsquo;t investigate.</p>

		<p> There was absolutely nothing wrong with questioning what everyone can see to be obvious. The mistake Shirley Matson made was that she did not play the PC game in voicing her concerns. </p>
<p>What she should have said was, I have noticed a distinct lack of &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; at several of the worksites and this concerns me - as well as the citizens of this county- who have voiced their concerns to me. As an elected official, I owe it to the citizens of Nye County to investigate this apparent lack of &#8220;diversity&#8221; and report back to my constituents; to ensure equal opportunities for all citizens within the construction/development sector in this county. </p>
<p>Please look into this matter and report back to me with your findings. I look forward to resolving this matter in the timeliest of fashions, so as not to interfere with planned development within the country of Nye. </p>
<p>If diversity is such an admirable goal, they could not possibly reprimand her for trying to promote it!<br>

		<p>MSNBC.  Good, this is as mainstream as it gets.  Let everyone see that &#8220;racism&#8221; today consists of nothing more than pointing out an obvious fact.  Furthermore, it is the Sheriff and the County Commissioners who are racist if anyone is.  They are the ones who conflate a cultural attribute, like language, for a genetic attribute like race.  </p>

<p>What he should have said was: There is probable cause to believe their immigration status may be questionable due to the fact American citzens and those in this country legally generally do not have to stand on street corners to solicite work. That is unless they&rsquo;re dealing dope or turning tricks, which in such cases, I assume, you would have no problems investigating. </p>

		<p>Interesting discussion of racism they bring up. They&rsquo;re missing the larger picture, tho, I think. They&rsquo;re missing the part where people of color are crowding us out of our own country. I think these media types have it backwards. Why can&rsquo;t what We say and do be considered a &#8216;reaction to the Racism their lives visit on us? It&rsquo;s worked so well for people of color. It&rsquo;s time every white reaction, no matter how bad, be blamed on ignorant people of color and their innate, uncleansible racism. </p>

		<p>They should do research.  If it turns out that a sizable amount (&gt;10%, perhaps) of the workers were illegals, then she should be congratulated for her excellent predictive skills.</p>

		<p>The Sheriff knows full well those working on that site are mainly comprised of illegal invaders from south of the border. But by calling Shirley Matson (she should be getting an award) a &#8220;racist,&#8221; for trying to protect Americans and employment opportunities, he is allowed to avoid the issue all together, while demonizing Shirley Matson in the process.</p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re not illegal, then why not check their I-9 and right to work documents, thus proving Shirley Matson wrong? Are you saying that no employer in the construction industry would ever hire an illegal Mexican invader? I know unprecedented!</p>
<p>I believe the interests of Nye County would be much better served with Shirley Matson as Sheriff, allowing the current Sheriff, Tony DeMeoto, to apply for a security guard position with La Raza&hellip;.<br>

		<p>A couple of years ago, the French government decided to construct a purpose-built facility in Calais, France, to house illegal immigrants caught whist attempting to smuggle themselves into UK by hiding in the back of trucks waiting to cross the English Channel. Someone in the Labour department started to conduct a routine check on these French Government sub-contract workers and discovered that about 30% were illegal immigrants. Trouble was, there was nowhere to house them locally so they were bussed to a holding centre many miles away. I would have thought they could have let them finish the job (unpaid) then let them stay inside for free. Never happened of course!! </p>
