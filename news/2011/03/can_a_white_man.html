<h1>Can a White Man Speak With Authority on Diversity?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Luke Visconti, Diversity Inc., March 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p><b>Question: </p>
<p>Upon returning to my office, re-energized by the DiversityInc event in March, I shared the information you addressed during your talk [when you] spoke about DiversityInc and mentioned your Ask the White Guy feature. When mentioning your feature to a group of white female colleagues, one responded by saying, what does he (a white guy) have to do with diversity; how does he create something like DiversityInc and how could he possibly speak with authority about diversity?</b></p>
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>I created DiversityInc as a consequence of having my consciousness raised by a friend, Tony Cato  &mdash;  at the time, a fellow Naval Aviator. {snip}</p>
<p>White men are a part of diversity and there is a great deal of diversity among white men. I recently spoke to a group of 900 police and fire chiefs in Oregon  &mdash;  97 percent white men. I made the point that they might not think they have diversity as they sit around the fire house or police station and see nothing but white men  &mdash;  but some of those white men grew up in single-parent households, some grew up in large families, some went to college on athletic scholarships, some worked their way through  &mdash;  and some didn&rsquo;t go at all. Some have a gay brother, some are gay themselves (and perhaps closeted). I told the chiefs that they could utilize the diversity they already have to gain new perspective on problems and in doing so would better fulfill their missions: to save lives. My point is that it is not skin color, gender or orientation that makes one &#8220;good at&#8221; managing diversity but mindset.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Anyone can become &#8220;authoritative&#8221; about diversity. Nobody comes to the table that way. How you get there, in my opinion, starts with understanding history. I&rsquo;ve gained a lot of perspective by reading books like Beverly Tatum&rsquo;s &#8220;Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria,&#8221; Iris Chang&rsquo;s &#8220;The Chinese in America,&#8221; Isabel Wilkerson&rsquo;s &#8220;The Warmth of Other Suns,&#8221; Douglas Blackmon&rsquo;s &#8220;Slavery By Another Name,&#8221; Ira Katznelson&rsquo;s &#8220;When Affirmative Action Was White&#8221; and Taylor Branch&rsquo;s trilogy on the civil-rights era.</p>
<p>History is important, but what I&rsquo;ve found transformative is personal involvement in organizations that do not serve you directly (by &#8220;you,&#8221; I mean loosely you as defined by gender, race, orientation, etc.). {snip}</p>
<p>Any executive can take the same steps to broaden their experience and cultural competence. We see how people work so hard to complete advanced degrees  &mdash;  and they are important  &mdash;  but life experience is how an executive does not become a Hosni Mubarak as our country and world change dramatically. {snip}</p>
<p>I will note that people who are not in the majority culture must deal with the majority culture as they try to retain their own identity, but those in the majority culture do not really have to deal with anything BUT the majority culture (doesn&rsquo;t make it right, but this is the reality). In this country, the majority culture is defined as white, male, heterosexual, Christian and not having an ADA-defined disability. But just because a person in the majority culture starts out with a much wider &#8220;blind spot&#8221; than people not in the majority culture doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s impossible for white men to become open advocates for diversity and inclusion. It also doesn&rsquo;t mean that a Black woman (for example) comes with an automatic Ph.D. in diversity management (it&rsquo;s just a lot easier for the Black woman to see the problem in the first place). We must all come to the realization that, as a reader put it nicely, &#8220;I am not different than you, I am different like you.&#8221;<br>

		<p> His column reads more as if it should be titled, &#8220;Ask The (Guilt-Ridden, Self-Hating) White Guy.&#8221; It&rsquo;s my experience that people who spend most of their time trying to help people who are arguably different from the group to which they belong   &mdash;   be it racial, gender, religious, whatever   &mdash;   wind up being hated by both sides.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ll give a brief example in my own life. One day, back in the late 1970s, I happened across a copy of &#8220;Ms.&#8221; Magazine. Intrigued, I started reading it, and somehow all of a sudden I began to see things as the feminists do: Women as the striving, noble, oppressed class; men as the dominating, brutal, ruling class.</p>
<p> I went along believing that for years, devouring all the feminist literature I could find, defending the feminist point of view publicly   &mdash;   well, you get the picture.</p>
<p> Then one day, I had an epiphany (to use one of the words the White Guy seems to like). This flashed across my mind: &#8220;Hey, stupid, all those unfeeling, sexist, Neanderthal guys these women are talking about   &mdash;   that&rsquo;s YOU!&#8221; Not in the sense that I felt guilty, but that I finally realized my whole gender was being maligned and put down by these agenda-ridden harpies. That was the end of my feminism.</p>
<p> Maybe the White Guy will have such an epiphany one of these days. Maybe he&rsquo;ll learn, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t turn on your own kind; you might need them some day!&#8221;</p>

		<p>A savant of diversity today, I think my first brush with it came as a child one Christmas morning.  There came a loud rapping on the back door and, when Dad opened it, we saw an old black man doubled in pain.  &#8220;I&rsquo;m stuck,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;She did it.&#8221;  Though the blow was far from fatal, sure enough, he bled from a wound in his side.  Looking back now, I see this episode as an extra gift plucked from &#8216;neath the tree, a glimmering of the riches to come.  More important, we and the old guy had forged a bond of comity in our mutual respect for one law which no man may before God deny  &mdash;  never give your wife a blade for Christmas.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m finding I have less and less tolerance for white people who get on a high horse and start moaning about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; and other &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; (i.e. anti-white) garbage.</p>
<p>A fellow white man who lectures me about diversity is a fool and likely even a traitor for haranguing me and my brothers about relinquishing whatever we&rsquo;ve struggled, worked and won for our families. Let that white idiot give up his &#8220;privilege&#8221; first if he dares. Tell him to move to a part of town or a city where his white kids will be a minority. Tell the white liberal to sacrifice his own kids to the gods of diversity, if he cares so much. Tell him to voluntarily pass up chances for advancement and let people of color take his job. Tell him to sell his property and give the proceeds to blacks and native Americans as reparations! Anything less and such a white man is an obnoxious hypocrite and a fool. And a white woman who does the same is little better, betraying her extended family for politically correct nonsense. If they have no sense of their racial identity - they soon will.</p>
<p>All anti-racist &#8220;discourse&#8221; is duplicitous and anti-white in essence, but I at least respect a &#8220;person of color&#8221; when they spout the stuff. They&rsquo;re fighting for their side, for their own people - who can blame them?</p>
<p>But a white who regurgitates that nonsense? It&rsquo;s the height of idiocy and it&rsquo;s downright dangerous. I think such fools should be constantly reminded of their foolishness by reminding them of their hypocrisy at every turn.</p>

		<p>My uncle fought against the Germans in WWII. He had great respect for their courage and tenacity while fighting for a lost cause. But when the hostilities were over, the survivors were obedient and submissive. The German men had been conquered, and they accepted their status as losers, doing what they could to suck up to their conquerors. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is the attitude of white men like visconti, as well as Dees, and Wiess. They believe that the liberal-feminist-minority coalition has triumphed in America. These white men are simply getting on the winning side, and profiting by doing so.</p>

		<p>	Europeans don&rsquo;t need this soft peddled the diversity issue; it&rsquo;s like giving ammunition to the enemy; we need only show the negative effect of diversity has on the middle classes pocketbook;<br>
	The last presidential election is a good example of the power of the purse over the populace, the people of Iowa voted for Obama because one over-riding issue he supported ethanol, and McCain didn&rsquo;t, think pocketbook, pocketbook, and pocketbook. </p>
<p>	When it comes to diversity keep it simple by saying something like &ldquo;The middle class will be burdened with supporting the third world populous in perpetuity until the whole financial system collapses unless we end affirmative action, or unless we stop all third world immigration.&rdquo;  ect, ect, ect.  </p>
<p>	Remember the middle class is simply euphemism; it&rsquo;s used for people European descent. <br>

		<p>I ended up in a few of these get-togethers, or &#8220;classes&#8221; if you will, as part of the job I had some years ago. It&rsquo;s mostly feel-good gibberish carried out by people who just fake their way through it. It&rsquo;s an industry that lots of people make a living off of. Yes, a white can get up there and do it but then they usually have to prove themselves by being more radical than anyone else, which just makes them all the more pathetic and contemptible. It&rsquo;s better done by non-whites as they are used to playing the victim role for money and advantage. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a 65 year old white woman - and I&rsquo;ve been around long enough to see what diversity has done for this country.  Please.  I don&rsquo;t want ANYONE - white, black, or green - talking about that garbage.  It is utter nonsense.  We now have renegade blacks robbing people in broad daylight, Mexicans stealing cars and going on police chases all over the country, and whites who don&rsquo;t have the right to congregate together without the intrusion of people of color.  THIS IS GOOD???  Get real.  I&rsquo;d like to feel safe going to the store without a knife or two concealed on my person - but I don&rsquo;t   &mdash;   THANKS TO DIVERSITY.  We were better off before, with no illegals and segregated schools.  I think most people were a lot happier back then, too, except blacks in the deep South.  But there are extremes in any situation - that, while not excusable, was the token extreme.  I say let&rsquo;s go back to the old ways, at least without the illegals and segregated schools.  It&rsquo;d be safer for all.</p>

		<p>I, a white man, can speak with authority about diversity.  Diversity means fewer whites.  Maximum diversity is achieved when there are no whites at all.  Diversity is our strength because everybody knows that all the ills of the world are caused by white people, thus the fewer white people the better.  The world would be a paradise if there were no white people at all, as it nearly is already in Haiti, Detroit, and Zimbabwe.<br>

		<p>To anonymous8,<br>
     Your &#8216;except blacks in the deep south&rsquo; hits a nerve. Southerners aren&rsquo;t the scapegoats and are tired of being singled out as the whipping boy for guilt-ridden northerners. <br>
     Instead of villifying them, consider their proximity to blacks educated them to the differences and dangers WAY before the newfound race realists figured it out. There were damn good reasons for Jim crow and segregation. It was your parts of the country that federally and economically beat the racist south into submission to the point that nothing they ever say will be taken seriously because it&rsquo;s said with a southern accent. Btw, exchange your knives for a conceal carry permit. Simple advice from a simple Southerner.</p>

		<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Anonymous 8, and I AM a Southerner, thank you.  I was there before the civil rights legislation was passed, and life in the deep South was hell for whites and blacks alike.  Blacks were scared to pass gas sideways because they might get beaten or worse; whites were scared to appear in any way sympathetic to the situation of the blacks, because if they did so appear, other whites would kill them and shun their families.  Don&rsquo;t tell me about what it was like - I KNOW.  Nobody&rsquo;s blaming anyone; that is simply the way it was, and it was not good for anyone.  It was more sad than anything else.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that if a male OB-GYN can speak with authority about women&rsquo;s physiology and functions, then why not have a white speaking with authority about diversity?  The truth is, the blacks (generally) of today don&rsquo;t WANT anybody but a black talking about diversity, period end of report.  Let&rsquo;s get honest!</p>

		<p>FYI:<br>
As Eldridge Cleaver so eloquently revealed 43 years ago in SOUL ON ICE,  &#8220;black power&#8221; ideology incites rape of white women as an &#8220;insurrectionary act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Righteous revenge intended to humble/mortify the evil oppressive white man. </p>
<p>Due to their focus on the evil oppressive white man, feminist - liberals support the key component of the &#8220;black power&#8221;  justification/incitement of the raping of white women by black men. </p>
<p>MAKES ME WANNA HOLLER by Nathan McCall reveals/confirms <br>
the recent past influence of the &#8220;black power&#8221; rape inciting ideology. </p>
<p>The daily news reveals/confirms the ongoing infuence <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of these self-hating white activists like this.  Until they are willing to live in a nonwhite neighborhood, give their jobs to nonwhites, let their daughter date a nonwhite male, give all their possessions to nonwhites, leave all their money to nonwhites, then they can shut their hypocritical mouths.  Notice how Tim Wise, Michael Moore, many white elitists who bash whites (especially white republicans), and all the &#8216;anti-racist&rsquo; whites NEVER live in black or hispanic neighborhoods?  Next time they spew hatred against whites, say, &#8220;have you gave your job to a minority?  Have you gave any money to a minority?  No?  Then shut your mouth and quit lecturing us to sacrifice when you aren&rsquo;t.&#8221;</p>
