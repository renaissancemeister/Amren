<h1>Readers Respond: Desegregation and Williams vs. Jacobs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Pasciak, Buffalo News, March 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two topics recently generated a slew of e-mails from readers: desegregation vs. neighborhood schools, and Superintendent James Williams vs. board member Chris Jacobs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a sampling of the e-mails I received on those two recent issues. There&rsquo;s no way I could possibly include all the e-mails, so I tried to pick a sample that would reflect the variety of viewpoints that readers shared. (In the case of Williams and Jacobs, the reason you don&rsquo;t see any e-mails in support of the superintendent is because there simply weren&rsquo;t any.)</p>
<p>A 1975 graduate of South Park High School shared her thoughts on <b>&#8220;Unsaid in school debate: Where the white kids are&#8221;</b> and <b>&#8220;Why it matters where the white kids are&#8221;:</b></p>
<p>I have been reading the article regarding the future of South Park High and the busing issue. The forced busing was extremely ugly, and I thought surely they would stop it after the first year, which was disastrous; so many injuries occurred as a result.</p>
<p>While I agree with the concept of integration, the forced busing of East High School students to our school was nothing short of criminal. The East High students clearly didn&rsquo;t want to be there, and the South Park students didn&rsquo;t want them there.</p>
<p>I just tried to stay out of the fray, but it was very important during my time there that you make friends of every race and from every athletic team to survive. You didn&rsquo;t dare go into a bathroom alone, and I quickly learned to enter school by the back doors to avoid the wars that occurred when the school buses pulled up.</p>
<p>To see this issue rising to the top again reinforces my thoughts at that time, if you force people to integrate, they simply won&rsquo;t do it. Inside the school, there was simply no integration, so the busing really didn&rsquo;t accomplish what they wanted anyway. I am not a prejudiced person and made friends with my classmates, but some students were very resistant because of the violence that occurred every morning.</p>
<p>A Buffalo resident wrote:</p>
<p>I was reading your blog about the return to neighborhood schools and a huge issue strikes me.</p>
<p>The issue isn&rsquo;t whether or not Buffalo schools will be mostly white but why there seems to be an unspoken understanding that it is &#8220;ok&#8221; that suburban schools can be mostly white but city schools cannot.</p>
<p>The choice to desegregate only the city schools and not the regional system based on something that was considered a societal moral issue was shortsighted at best, deliberate at its worst. I have no argument against the reasons for desegregation but to stop such an important social concern at a political and invisible line, drawn in the 1850s, is absurd.</p>
<p>Any child, in any neighborhood of Buffalo, is going to grow up interacting with more races and lifestyles than just about any of the race-hypersensitive communities in the suburbs today. It is a shame how many people I know who consider parts of Tonawanda, Cheektowaga as places not worth investing in because of blacks are moving it, maybe if they went to schools that were not racially homogeneous, we wouldn&rsquo;t still be having these arguments today, 40 years later.</p>
<p>It is appalling and just plain sad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The $64,000 question is why is it only the responsibility of the City of Buffalo alone to have integrated schools. When we know that neighborhood schools have so many other positive aspects to them that everyone would benefit from.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A teacher in the Buffalo Public Schools wrote:</p>
<p>There have been countless times in recent years that the professionals in the Buffalo Public School system have been outright embarrassed by the words and/or deeds of Dr. Williams. It is unfair that he represents our educational community.</p>
<p>There are so many intelligent, dedicated and persevering professionals. We did not hire him. We did not hire his assistant superintendents (count them). We cannot fire him. We cannot criticize him. We must obey him. We do help elect the Board of Education, but as you know, the big deals go down behind closed doors, just like they do in Albany.</p>

								<h2>Superintendent to Jacobs: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sick of Your Craziness&rdquo;</h2>
						<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Board member Chris Jacobs picked up on something Paladino mentioned  &mdash;  an increase in non-union administrators  &mdash;  and pressed Superintendent James Williams on it. Jacobs wanted to know whether there had, in fact, been such an increase in recent years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williams: &#8220;Then, Chris, look at the budget book and you all can do what you all want to do. The man is stupid. He&rsquo;s ignorant. And you all cater to that stupid stuff. I&rsquo;m fed up with it. I&rsquo;m through with him. I&rsquo;m not going there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Jacobs: &#8220;Let me just say something. I don&rsquo;t agree with a lot that Mr. Paladino said. I have disagreed with him on many items. I have personally met with him to disagree, to tell him his focus needs to be on Albany. But I&rsquo;m a board member, and when there&rsquo;s a part of a presentation interests me, I have every right. And you have an obligation  &mdash;  &#148;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Williams: &#8220;I don&rsquo;t have an obligation to  &mdash;  &#148;</p>
<p>Jacobs: &#8220;You work for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams: &#8220;I am sick of your craziness, Chris.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacobs: &#8220;My craziness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams: &#8220;Yes, your craziness.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was about at that point that Jacobs gathered up his stuff and left.</p>

		<p>I wonder when people will catch on to the fact that this is what you get when you try to apply affirmative action to critical leadership positions. Blacks have a tendency to be arrogant and down right holier than thou in these positions.</p>
<p>Sometime back I saw an article in a local newspaper that declared<br>
integration to be an utter and complete failure. In the sense that it had failed to improve the academic performance of blacks and achieve the MLK dream of amalgamation and unification of the races. In an effort to keep the fallacy alive they keep trying to throw the races together, and dumb down the curriculum. And in the process have completely ruined the public education system in this country.   </p>

Blacks have dominated the Buffalo School Board for years and only hire black superintendents.</p>
<p>Williams was tauted as the black Messiahs who would turn the schools around and raise black achievement.</p>
<p>Early on, he supported returning black trouble makers to the classroom instead of removing them to special schools. Blacks love him.</p>
<p>At the same time, black failure rates have increased under the direction of Williams. The last failure rate I recall being reported was 53% for blacks.</p>
<p>Listening to local black radio, blacks support Williams, the black dominated school board, and black principles and administrators. They also endlessly complain about their kids not being educated. They don&rsquo;t seem to draw any connection between the increasing failure rate of blacks kids and black domination of school administrators.</p>
<p>When blacks are in charge of schools, they only get worse. Blacks say they care about their kids education but the only thing they really care about is knowing the black man is in charge.</p>
<p>As long as blacks are in charge, it will only get worse.  <br>

		<p>Question for those who think:</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed that it is all White nations (cities, towns, states, provinces) and only White nations that must be flooded with non-Whites and &#8220;enriched with diversity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Has anyone noticed that nobody is flooding Japan with non-Japanese and telling them to intermarry?  </p>
<p>Has anyone noticed that it is only in White nations where &#8220;they&#8221; are trying to create a &#8220;blended humanity?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ponder that.  Sounds an awful lot like White genocide, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Deductive reasoning leads to accurately establishing cause and effect relationships. It&rsquo;s the basis on which scientific progress has proceeded. Blacks lack this skill - it explains just about everything. They tolerate failure forever so long as they can blame some white man. They are hopeless! We live with every ethnic group there is e.g. Eskimos, Indians, many varieties of Asians. None is as destructive to a community as blacks. Quality of life, property values plunge with their presence. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the uproar when former Erie County executive Joel Giambra mentioned at a council or school board meeting covering the topic of racism that he removed his children from Buffalo city schools because of the constant harassment they endured by being out-numbered by blacks. Only the grandstanding blacks took issue with that statement, but the white residents fully understood the dilemma. In Buffalo, NY, even most of the liberals I met were race realists and there was A LOT of white unity, and especially among ethnic whites like the Polish, Italians, and Irish.  </p>

		<p> The students are the ultimate loser in all these actions. When the superintendant and board members are fighting in public, the students are laughing at all of them.<br>
 It is the pinnacle of unprofessional behavior to tell someone publicly that they are tired of their &#8220;craziness&#8221;. Mr. Jaobs was correct in telling Mr. Williams that he works for them.<br>
 I think all students should go to the school closest to their home. Forced bussing has been proven to be a disaster.<br>
 But the thng that puzzles me the most is how blacks seem to beleive that simply by sending more blacks to white schools can somehow improve their education and learning skills.</p>

<p><i>The forced busing was extremely ugly&hellip; so many injuries occurred&hellip;the forced busing&hellip;was nothing short of criminal. &hellip;You didn&rsquo;t dare go into a bathroom alone, and I quickly learned.. to avoid the wars when the school buses pulled up.</i></p>
<p><i>if you force people to integrate, they simply won&rsquo;t do it.</i></p>
<p>You write this about your own experience yet you also *hypocritically* (note the use of the latest, freshest grammatical demarcations!) write that you still believe in integration?</p>
<p>Do you think the situation has changed since 1975, or has gotten worse? (I&rsquo;ll help you here: it has gotten much worse for, especially for Whites and White children).</p>
<p>Are you OK with your own children forced to integrate with blacks?  Or is it only OK with you as long as it&rsquo;s &#8220;other&#8221; White children forced into a threatening situation with surly blacks to create &#8220;integration&#8221; (which you yourself write that you agree with)?</p>
<p><b>The man is stupid. He&rsquo;s ignorant. And you all cater to that stupid stuff. I&rsquo;m fed up with it. I&rsquo;m through with him. I&rsquo;m not going there.</b></p>
<p>Williams is a typical, black, full-of-himself, puff-up, useless PhD  educrat steeped in marxist thought and racial hatred of whites. As a black, he is untouchable and he knows it. </p>
<p>Disagree with him, no matter how rational, factual and logic your arguments and you are a White Nazi.  And, don&rsquo;t think he won&rsquo;t hesitate to call you that, ending any/all arguments you have with him.  The msm will ignore any racist invective &#8220;dr.&#8221; williams hurls at you and report you as the one who introduced racial hatred against a black man.  For good measure, the msm will write up a puff-piece as to how &#8220;dr.&#8221; williams faced and overcame great hurdles including poverty, institutional racism, and white nazism to &#8220;achieve his dream&#8221; of helping other poor blacks overcome a racist White system.</p>
<p> If there is a vote to get rid of him, he wins again as he quietly receives a monstrous severance package, life-long health benefits and outrageous retirement benefits .  This is to head-off any/all racial discrimination suits which he will surely file if you do not meet his demands.</p>
<p><b>It was about at that point that Jacobs gathered up his stuff and left.</b></p>
<p>This <i>frosts</i> me to no end, another White weenie throwing in the towel, taking his ball and going home (at least he didn&rsquo;t swing his purse at williams) but  on the other hand, Jacobs was certainly in a no-win situation as a White against a black with the msm, government, countless pro-black organizations on his side.</p>
<p>Infuriating.</p>
<p>But soooooo typical.</p>

		<p>Way back in the 1970&rsquo;s, a line from the musical, &#8216;A Chorus Line&rsquo; struck me as funny.</p>
<p>&#8216;I once thought of committing suicide, until I realized that committing suicide in Buffalo was redundant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I now see the truth in such a statement. And why any sane person would never want to live in Buffalo&hellip;.or Detroit&hellip;..or Atlanta&hellip;..or L.A&hellip;&hellip;</p>
