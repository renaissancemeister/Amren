			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Hopper, ABC News, March 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The alleged gang rape of an 11-year-old girl by at least 18 boys and young men has sparked shame and outrage in a tiny Texas town, but it has also stirred racial tensions that threaten to split the East Texas hamlet.</p>
<p>All of the defendants arrested are African-American and the girl is Hispanic.</p>
<p>The hardscrabble town of Cleveland, which is 45 miles from Houston, has fewer than 8,000 residents and since the saw mill closed the biggest employers are Wal-Mart and a nearby prison. In a town this small, everyone is a neighbor, but that small town ambience is being severely strained.</p>
<p>The rape allegedly occurred last November, and the list of suspects has been growing as arrests keep coming. It&rsquo;s not clear whether more arrests are in the works.</p>
<p>The suspects range in age from 14 to 26, include stars on the high school&rsquo;s basketball team as well as the son of a school board member.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sorry for the little girl. I feel sorry for everyone involved .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the city is in turmoil,&#8221; Inez Dickerson [the great-grandmother of one of the suspects] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not going to play the race card on this because my grandson and all the rest were very young men and they could have given a second thought on this,&#8221; Dickerson said.</p>
<p>While Dickerson believes the flaring of racial tensions isn&rsquo;t warranted, others disagree.</p>
<p>Houston community activist Quanell X will host a town hall meeting this evening called &#8220;What&rsquo;s the real truth behind the rape allegations?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every adult male that had sex with this child should go to prison, I don&rsquo;t care what the color is. But I do not believe black males are the only ones that had contact with this young child,&#8221; said Quanell X, the leader of Houston&rsquo;s New Black Panther Party. &#8220;It appears to me there&rsquo;s only been the selective prosecution of one community, which is African American.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quannell X said the rally has been moved from a church to a community center because, &#8220;The church received some death threats.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gang Rape Charges Raise Race Tensions in Texas Town</b></p>
<p>The village has a history of racial violence. In 1988, an African American man was arrested in Cleveland for allegedly stealing a fountain pen. The man, 30-year-old Kenneth Simpson, was allegedly beaten to death by white police officers while in prison. The officers were acquitted of murder charges and returned to work.</p>
<p>In addition, Cleveland is embroiled in a political scandal where three city council members are facing a recall election following complaints of corruption. All three of those city council members are African American.</p>
<p>More than half of the town is white, with the rest of the residents split between blacks and Hispanics.</p>
<p>Most of the defendants have ties to Precinct 20, the nickname for the predominantly African-American neighborhood in Cleveland. The black neighborhood is sometimes referred to as &#8220;the quarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Racial Tensions in Cleveland, Texas</b></p>
<p>Brenda Myers knows the girl and her family. Myers runs the Community and Children&rsquo;s Impact Center in Cleveland, one of the few programs for Cleveland&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s becoming a black and white issue because it happened over in the quarters. It&rsquo;s segregating our community again,&#8221; Myers said. &#8220;The reaction is anger, devastation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;ll be claimed that the eleven year old was a willing participant, she looked eighteen, it&rsquo;s all her fault, etc. One, two or even three perpetrators, that would sound like the usual, more common type case. But eighteen? And it just went on? Basketball players are involved, wouldn&rsquo;t you just know that one was coming. Gang rape really is a black thing throughout the world, whether they&rsquo;re in their native African country or in Sweden or in small town USA. Oh, for PC balance they throw in a totally unrelated story of a black beaten to death in 1988 while in prison, just to remind everyone of the inherent victim status of blacks.   </p>

<p>This is laughable but it&rsquo;s easy to understand why someone (even a white person) could draw this conclusion. Most movies these days, even ones about criminal enterprises, have to adhere to a multicult storyline. Thus, as in the case of the recent movie &#8220;Takers&#8221; we see a gang composed of both black and white males. In reality, criminal groups (whether gangs or flash mobs) tend to be monochromatic. Criminals who rob banks in groups generally are of one race, as are cartels (see La Eme, La Cosa Nostra, Nicky Barnes). Thus it&rsquo;s fairly easy to deduce that if a pack of black boys were accused of raping a girl, it was probably black boys and no one else. Did any white racialists accuse the prosecution in the Duke Lacrosse rape hoax of selective prosecution? Wasn&rsquo;t there at least one black lacross player complicit in the rape that never was?</p>

		<p>Dickerson: the perps &#8220;could have given a second thought on this&#8221;.  Men who have to think twice, or ponder for a few moments, on whether to rape a little girl are not fit to live in a civilized society.</p>

		<p>This travesty was discussed on another site. Below are a few points brought out during the discussion.</p>
<p>-Several people cited &#8216;The Color of Crime&rsquo; to show this type of behavior was peculiar to black men.  One poster, who claimed to have a psychology degree, would have none of it saying that the report was from a &#8220;racist site&#8221;. That the data was drawn from the Dept. of Justice and Census Bureau was irrelevant.</p>
<p>-Aforementioned psychology grad claimed to have seen regression analysis proving that poverty, not race, was the relevant correlation to crime. He provided no link &#8220;racist&#8221;, &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; or otherwise.</p>
<p>-That &#8216;The Color of Crime&rsquo; showed race a more powerful crime predictor than education, poverty and unemployment combined was again dismissed as &#8220;racist&#8221;.</p>
<p>-Someone mentioned lower IQ as a cause of high black crime, including rape. This brought about howls of &#8220;that&rsquo;s just Rushton&rsquo;s debunked garbage&#8221;. That neither &#8216;The Global Bell Curve&rsquo; nor &#8216;The Bell Curve&rsquo; were written by Rushton made no dent in the &#8220;Rushton had been debunked and all of academia laughs at him&#8221; claims.  He seems like such a reasonable, even mild-mannered scholar, but he weighs heavy in the hearts of religious egalitarians.</p>
<p>-IQ studies from &#8216;The Global Bell Curve&rsquo; were dismissed as irrelevant because IQ is higher among the educated; therefore, it was asserted that lack of education was responsible for low IQ in sub-Saharan Africa. Rushton was again blamed for the book, though it would be impossible for a single scholar to do that many IQ studies and he didn&rsquo;t even write the book!</p>
<p>-Those with a race realist perspective were accused of watching Fox News and were,therefore, automatically disqualified from offering any valid opinion. </p>

		<p>It is unbelievable the depths to which blacks will go to defend their criminals.  Here is a comment on this story from Khou.com readers &#8220;A lot of young people&rsquo;s lives will be ruined by this young, promiscuous girl. Something this big had to have been planned. Put them all in jail including the young girl&#8221;.  Only a black would write something so hideous!  </p>

<p>Notice that even though the rape was black on hispanic, its now  a black and WHITE issue!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure little miss Myers whos so &#8220;angry and devastated&#8221; will now feel she needs to date one of the black rapists to prove shes not &#8216;racisss&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Myers runs the Community and Children&rsquo;s Impact Center in Cleveland, one of the few programs for Cleveland&rsquo;s youth.</p>
<p>What do you want to bet that most of the &#8220;youths&#8221; that use this center are black and that most, if not all the funding comes from Whites.</p>

		<p>Why does the Myers say &ldquo;It&rsquo;s becoming a black and white issue because it happened over in the quarters. It&rsquo;s segregating our community again,the reaction is anger, devastation.&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The 11 year old victim was Hispanic and the criminals were Blacks. It seems that this would be a Black vs Hispanic issue. <br>
It is horrible to read of such depravity, but Hispanics have been just as bad gang-raping and murdering in Texas, California, and so on. I recall a case in Texas where two young Latinas were raped and beaten to death by one of the Mexican gangs. </p>

		<p> Let me see if I missed something here: The usual black agitators are claiming that their race is being &#8220;selectively prosecuted,&#8221; in the case. Cell phone videos exist that presumably show at least some of the men and boys   &mdash;   are any of those visible, obviously not black or Hispanic? If there were any White youths involved, does anyone in his right mind think that the blacks already arrested wouldn&rsquo;t have ratted them out long before now?</p>
<p> Yet with all this, Quanell X is making the usual wild claims about racial bias, etc. Yes, he&rsquo;s playing the nearly-worn-out race card. I think blacks need to get a new deck.</p>
<p> And by the way: If anyone still wonders what is wrong with our &#8220;inner cities&#8221; and with black neighborhoods like &#8220;the quarters,&#8221; they should take a look at the photos of those six leading citizens which appeared with this news story.</p>

		<p>I have read in other sources that the defense attorneys are using &#8220;she looked 18&#8221; line to defend their clients.  I don&rsquo;t know about TX, but Missouri state law presumes that no person under the age of 13 can possibly look 17 (MO&rsquo;s absolute age of sexual majority), ergo anyone who has sex with a person under 13 has to be committing stat rape (or a higher category of rape if the sex wasn&rsquo;t consensual, because if the girl you rape is under 14, the felony is more serious and gets you more prison time), ergo the excuse of &#8220;she looked at least 17&#8221; is automatically and legally rejected.  Plain words, if she&rsquo;s 12 or younger, you ought to be able to see that she&rsquo;s not 17 or older.</p>

		<p>Quanell X thinks this may be racism?  Shocking!<br>
Look at the mug shots, the guy ins the upper left looks like something from 10,000 BC. <br>
Call me crazy but, I believe that rape is one of the crimes that deserves the death penalty.  <br>
If there is indisputable evidence of a rape, child molestation, chronic violent offenders, all get the needle in my world.  Lethal injections would really clean out our prisons in a hurry, reduce costs, scare the heck out of the rest of them on the streets.  </p>

<p>Yeah, sure sounds like a &#8220;history of racial violence&#8221; to me.  One incident which *allegedly* happened where the officers were acquitted?</p>
<p>What a horribly racist town.  White people are evil!  Yet oddly enough, Black people and Hispanics continue to flee their own race to be around them.</p>

		<p>Considering i have heard nothing about hispanics being angry over this, we can only conclude that the media is deliberately lying.</p>
<p>It was a white girl, notice how never once is the word pedophile used? Only whites can be pedophiles, when a black rapes a young girl, she was asking for it and looked older and wanted it anyways.</p>

		<p>Gang rape is a horrible crime when committed against ANY ONE, including a grown female.<br>
Some of these  &#8220;youths&#8221; were high-school and middle school students, who would surely have known the child victim&rsquo;s age with certainty.<br>
Gang-rape when perpetuated against an eleven-year-old child is past the comprehension of any person with normal human sensibilities.<br>
(By the way, what does it matter how she dressed or what makeup she had or didn&rsquo;t have on her little face? She could have been walking up and down the street stark naked, carrying a sign saying F#$%* ME, and she still shouldn&rsquo;t have been touched by any male of any age.)  </p>

		<p>The mothers and girlfriends of many of these rapists are defending them by saying the girl looked much older and said she was 17.  But why doesn&rsquo;t it bother them that their son/boyfriend is having group sex with 27 other men (and in a filthy trailer on video)?!  Is that behavior just perfectly normal and acceptable in the black &#8220;community&#8221;?</p>

		<p>This obviously was a Bantu on Hispanic crime. But, NOBODY wants to admit there are Bantu-Hispanic tensions. To do so, would tear a hole in the fabric of the  &#8220;multiculturalism&#8221; cloth that the pezzonovanti are trying to weave. That&rsquo;s why cops are quick to say that &#8220;there are no racial aspects&#8221;, whenever Bantus and Hispanics fight, like in school cafeterias, or on street corners. This is true whether it happens in Texas, California, New York, Illinois or Arizona.</p>
<p>Well, the multicultural cloth is starting to unravel. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re now trying to make it a Bantu-Caucasian issue again. </p>

		<p>Well, of course black people have to turn this around so they are the  victims. If blacks lose their victim status&hellip;who will they be? They are always the victim and everybody is out to get them. It amazes me that the black community can so coldly slam the real victim&hellip;.the poor little hispanic girl. </p>
<p>It is great that the black people are recording their own crimes. They will wear a mask and hoodie when robbing a bank to avoid the cameras, but record this crime on their own phones&hellip;..and distribute it THEMSELVES!!! </p>
<p>But seriously, I hope the little girl is getting the help she needs. Hispanics are not well known for taking care of their females very well. </p>

&#8220;Quannell X. Havent we heard his name before? New Black Panthers? same thing.The New Black Panthers are the ones who burned to death the 12 year old white child, and then told the black female welder to tell the poleece that she was told to dispose of the body, which she said that she didnt know that it was a body.Hispanics wont be as tolerating of this kind if thing as whites are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes we have. Sean Hannity has had him on his radio show several times. He one of those Blacks who talks rapidly and is all over the map logically. He has a tone that resembles Farrakhan and his now deceased Lt. Kalid Muhammed who brought us &#8220;Kill the Jews. Kill the faggots. Kill the Whites..etc.&#8221;.  I think that Hannity has him on purely for the entertainment factor and to demonstrate the total irrationality of these creatures.  Quannell X led a demonstration over some issue in a totally White neighborhood in some Texas city and he and his demonstrators had to retreat from an extremely angry White crowd.  He reminds me of that &#8220;Professor&#8221; Hill, another frequent guest of Hannity and O&rsquo;Reilly, who has a Ph.D in some half assed field. I believe that Hill wasn&rsquo;t renewed at Temple University and now is at Columbia. Another 15 words per second speaker.</p>

		<p>In all cases such as this, one can easily guess the response if the races were different.  That is, what would happen if 11 whites gang raped an 11 year old black girl?  </p>
<p>The news media would be coving this non-stop.  Sharpton, Jackson, and the rest of the race pimps would be agitating, and the black hordes would be rioting in the streets.</p>
<p>However, since the perps were black, there has been zero news coverage outside the local region.<br>

		<p>Once again, blacks blaming whites and others for their bad behavior. &#8220;It&rsquo;s her fault, she said she was 17.&#8221;  I realize there are people that look young and mature slow while others mature faster, but how can ANY 11 year old kid pass for an older teenager/young adult?  That&rsquo;s plain stupid and gross, too.  </p>
<p>Of course, &#8220;yo&rsquo; be targettin&rsquo; black folks more, yo.&#8221;  Wellll&hellip;.stop committing so many crimes and you blacks won&rsquo;t be targeted so much.  How&rsquo;s that for an idea?</p>

		<p>The sheer shamelessness, mendacity, deceit, lies and cunning of blacks never, ever ceases to amaze me.</p>
<p> Here we have a clear, open and shut case of the gang-rape of an 11 year old hispanic girl by a group of black males.Whitey was not involved in any way, shape or form, but yet, but yet, somehow this atrocity is &#8216;linked&rsquo; with a completely unconnected case that happened over 20 years ago in which the alleged perpetrators (who happened to be police officers, presumably White), were acquitted on all counts, therefore they are innocent men as far as the law is concerned.</p>
<p>  It would be laughable if it wasn&rsquo;t so darned serious.</p>

		<p>The victim accepted a ride home from several black males in a car,I saw on the Council of Conservative Citizens website. My parents would have absolutely prohibited any of my siblings or myself  from getting into a vehicle with any blacks in it.I wonder what kind of parents she had? As bad as some white liberals.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s becoming a black and white issue&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>I am asking the same question that posters #1 and #2 are: why is &#8220;white&#8221; part of the issue at all?</p>
<p>Blacks and latinos generally hate each other, and social justice, diversity activists give this a free pass (because they know their brainwashing won&rsquo;t work on blacks and latinos).</p>
<p>There is a grey area between the black and latino divide.  There are certain latinos, mostly dominicans, but also from eleswhere, who idolize black culture - copying the symbols, lingo, rap music and stuff.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gang rape really is a black thing throughout the world, whether they&rsquo;re in their native African country or in Sweden or in small town USA&#8221;</p>
<p>In the book &#8220;What Every Cop Knows&#8221;, it is alleged that it is quite common for young white woman to be abducted off the streets of Chi, taken to a project [most are gone now], that young woman kept for days and raped by dozens of men. Having young boys watch the whole time.</p>

		<p> When the members of the Duke LaCrosse team was accused of raping a black woman; it was covered by every news agency in America almost non stop for months. The three men&rsquo;s names were splattered over the world. College professors, politicians, womens groups and just about everybody lined up to condemn them publicly and scream for their head to be placed on a spike.<br>
 Once again the main stream media gives these accused blacks a pass.</p>

		<p>Quanell X is  whining about racism when he belongs to the most racist bigoted hate monger group on the face of the planet. What a joke! I guess everyone has already forgotten about Quanell X&rsquo;s brother Blank Panther(Samir Shabazz)saying &#8220;I hate white people with every iota, we need to kill all white crackers and heir white cracker babies&#8221; (it&rsquo;s all caught on video and audio)  can any group possibly get any more racist than that? I don&rsquo;t understand why this loser group is still around and even makes the news. Probably because they are protected by Eric Holder which shows exactly what the Obama administration is all about.  </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget young arabs&hellip;they run rapant in Sweden and Australia and wherever else they are in numbers. They rape innocent white women, and they blame the women for the same reasons we used to hear the rapists use here in the U.S.: she was dressing like a slut, she asked for it, etc.</p>

<p>So using the FBI stats wouldnt that be a white girl these blacks raped? So what else is new? </p>
<p>No, she will be listed as hispanic because she is a victim. All hispanic victims get their own catagory, but all hispanic perps are lumped in with whites in the FBI statistics the last time I checked so they can inflate &#8220;white&#8221; crime rates, especially &#8220;white&#8221; &#8220;hate crime&#8221; rates.<br>

<p>The time for such nicety has long since passed. It&rsquo;s time to segregate by race. It&rsquo;s heigh time Africans had their own homeland free from white persecution. It&rsquo;s  also time European Americans had a land free from the tender ministrations of savage Africans.</p>
