			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peter Allen, Daily Mail (London), March 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>France was today attacked by religious leaders for organising a &#8216;poisonous&rsquo; national debate about the growing number of Muslims living in the country.</p>
<p>They accused President Nicolas Sarkozy of trying to attract racist voters by holding the all-party political discussion next Tuesday.</p>
<p>It will see people complaining about numerous aspects of Islamic life, from its links with terrorist groups to the wearing of burkas.</p>
<p>But French Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Buddhists today joined Muslim leaders in published a joint statement saying the debate would cause &#8216;confusion in the troubled period we are going through.&rsquo; </p>
<p>With the French airforce currently joining the RAF in pouring bombs and missiles on Muslims in Libya and Afghanistan, the leaders believe that Gallic followers of Islam will be stigmatised even further.</p>
<p>The statement points to the championing of irreligious secularism by the debate&rsquo; s organisers, rather than a form of secularism embracing all religions, including Islam.</p>
<p>&#8216;Do we need, in the current climate, a debate on secularism?&rsquo; says the statement. &#8216;Is a political party, even if it is in the majority, the right entity to lead such a debate alone?&rsquo; </p>
<p>The religious leaders said secularism should be &#8216;a foundation of our desire to live together&rsquo;, warning against: &#8216;lumping things together and so risking stigmatisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former presidential candidate Francois Bayrou, leader of the France&rsquo;s Democratic Movement, said the debate would spread &#8216;poison&rsquo; around the six million odd Muslims who live in France.</p>
<p>With a general election due next year, Mr Sarkozy&rsquo;s governing UMP party has been trying to win votes from the far right National Front party.</p>
<p>It has already succeeded in banning the burka, and other forms of Muslim head coverings, and has stressed its opposition to worshippers praying openly on French streets.</p>
<p>But UMP leader Jean-Francois Cope, who pushed for the debate, issued an open letter to Muslims this week saying he wanted a new &#8216;Code of Secularity&rsquo; that would keep schools and other institutions entirely religion-free.</p>
<p>&#8216;The practice of Islam in a secular nation is not the burka not prayers in the street, nor the rejection of diversity,&rsquo; said Mr Cope.</p>
<p>The national debate about Islam and secularism will take place a week before France&rsquo;s burka ban officially comes into force.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for the trap French citizens, Sarkozy is a fraud.  He has be pro-multicultural since birth.  He demanded interracial marriages a few years back.  He knows he has the Liberal/Socialist/minority vote.  Now he is just preaching to get the indigenous vote, since that is where the major voters are.  I would have loved to have visited Marseilles or Paris, but not now.  Good job Nick!</p>
<p>American politicians are the masters of the flip-flop.  Just look at the views of an incumbent as compared to their voting history.</p>

		<p>Sarkozy is reportedly down in the polls so may be trying to preempt the issues brought forth by the National Front. You can always get some cleric or two to sign anything so let&rsquo;s not let the writer manipulate us into thinking that the &#8220;joint statement&#8221; signed  by &#8220;religious leaders&#8221; represents the sentiments of the majority of Christians, either of followers or clerics. &#8220;Gallic followers of Islam&#8221; ; what a horrible joke. </p>

<p>Gallic followers of Islam???  Huh?</p>
<p>Oh, my, my!  Wow.  Such clever terminology. <br>
You almost fooled me for a moment that they were French.</p>
<p>Did you really mean to say  &#8220;alien Moslems residing in France&#8221;?<br>
Is that what you were TRYING to say?</p>

		<p>Sarkozy was successful in capturing votes from the National Front the last election by talking tough on immigration but unfortunately that&rsquo;s all it was, talk.  He&rsquo;ll never do anything about the muslim/immigration problem other than hold some debate or token gestures cracking down on illegals.  He&rsquo;s an immigrant himself and his origins aren&rsquo;t European.  </p>

		<p>What the French need to do, as they ban the burka and the prayers in the street - is to keep going and eventually ban all Muslims from setting foot one in their country.  France is EUROPEAN, not Muslim, and needs to have enough pride in its history to keep it free from the bloody Muslim presence.  Then other European nations could do the same, and then Australia, then the USA, and last but not least, Canada.  THAT is what needs to happen, in my not at all humble opinion.</p>
