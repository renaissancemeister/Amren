<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110308/US.Census.America_s.Heartland/">US &#8216;Heartland&rsquo; Near Historic Shift from Midwest</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hope Yen, Comcast News, March 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>America&rsquo;s population center is edging away from the Midwest, pulled by Hispanic growth in the Southwest, according to census figures. The historic shift is changing the nation&rsquo;s politics and even the traditional notion of the country&rsquo;s heartland  &mdash;  long the symbol of mainstream American beliefs and culture.</p>
<p>The West is now home to the four fastest-growing states  &mdash;  Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho  &mdash;  and has surpassed the Midwest in population, according to 2010 figures. California and Texas added to the southwestern population tilt, making up more than one-fourth of the nation&rsquo;s total gains since 2000.</p>
<p>When the Census Bureau announces a new mean center of population next month, geographers believe it will be placed in or around Texas County, Mo., southwest of the present location in Phelps County, Mo. That would put the center at the outer edge of the Midwest, on a path to leave the region by midcentury.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Census Bureau calculates the mean U.S. center every 10 years based on its national head count. The center represents the middle point of the nation&rsquo;s population distribution  &mdash;  the geographic point at which the country would balance if each of its 308.7 million residents weighed the same.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fastest U.S. growth is occurring in the Mountain West, which includes Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. As California&rsquo;s growth slows, many of the Mountain state arrivals are Hispanic immigrants seeking jobs and affordable family living. Hispanics tend to lean Democratic when voting.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>-In seven of the eight Mountain states, Hispanics accounted for nearly 50 percent or more of the population gains among children under 18. Montana, which had a population loss of children, was the exception.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>-California, which failed to add a House seat for the first time in its history, would have lost population if it weren&rsquo;t for growth among Hispanics and other minorities, estimates show. The state, the nation&rsquo;s largest with 37.3 million, continues to grow primarily from immigration and births.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>State officials are tentatively planning for a commemorative marker in Texas County or its vicinity. Texas County boasts 26,000 residents, with whites making up 92 percent of the population, compared with roughly 65 percent for the country. Blacks make up 3.3 percent and Hispanics 1.6 percent.</p>

		<p>The population center has been moving south and west for a long time, and has been relatively near St. Louis for quite a few decades.  However, since 1970, the southwestward shift has been mostly due to Hispanic immigration, the further you go past 1970, the more likely it is to be true.</p>

<p>Calif. lost population because of illegal immigration and minorities moving in. That caused whites that were able to move out to leave, and the whites that couldnt leave to stop having as many children. I should know because I moved my family out years ago.</p>

		<p>This is incorrect.  What they should be saying is that the center of Mexico is shifting Northeast, whereas the center of the United States, which has lost the Southwest to Mexico, has moved significantly East as well.</p>

		<p>The Hispanics can be a royal pain, but I honestly am not nearly as concerned about them as I am about the Muslims.  Now THERE is a group that is extremely dangerous to us all   &mdash;   those are the ones we have to find a way to eliminate.  (before they eliminate us).</p>

		<p>Be a contrarian, move to the Midwest. I will sooner or later. The &#8220;Heartland&#8221; in the West (California) is not for me. It is not a healthy place to raise a (white) family.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t hear anyone speaking out against illegal immigration anymore. You used to hear it on O&rsquo;Reilly or Hannity. But not no more. Not for a while now. I think these are phony conservatives that just try to derail white people on certain issues. By the way how did O&rsquo;Reilly stand on the Dream Act that benefitted the children of illegal aliens? I never heard him open his mouth on the subject, nor did Rush Limbaugh.</p>

		<p>So the reconquista moves along, with a couple additional states thrown in to boot! Meanwhile, we get treated to stories like this, written with glee over the pending demise of the White race in our own country; all because we have a government that flat out refuses to enforce immigration law.</p>
<p>How much longer is this supposed to be tolerated by White America?<br>

		<p>I doubt that states like Wyoming or Idaho will soon have majority Hispanic populations.  There are few jobs there that need illegal labor.  These states are over 95% white and are likely to stay that way for many decades to come.  Whites who can afford to move there are doing so now.  I will soon.</p>

		<p>Immigrants don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t pay their own way.</p>
<p>Want them gone?  Simply stop feeding them.</p>
<p>Seriously, the issue is not &#8220;immigration&#8221; in any legitimate sense and never was. It&rsquo;s about welfare&hellip;.especially welfare redirected into the drug trade.</p>
<p>Except for a tiny handful of mexicans, NONE of the non-whites who have come to the US over the last couple of decades or more, could survive more than a few weeks if their welfare checks stopped coming (or their customers welfare/crack money stopped coming) in the mail.</p>
<p>Under this situation, it becomes clear who the real enemy is.  Who steals the money out of your pocket and gives it to them so they can come to your neighborhood and rape your daughter.</p>
<p>Putting an end to THAT should be the primary focus of all whites, everywhere, especially since you need no real racial awakening to get on board.</p>

		<p>When I read this story this morning I damm near wept. I was recently in Bozeman Montana and was shocked to see Mexican gang bangers. Foolishly I deluded myelf into believing it was an anomoly? Clearly I was wrong as this story shows. Its game over man. The white race are going to be the new Jews. Wandering around the world endlessly looking to start their own succesful communities until they are forced out for being succesful. Rinse and repeat.</p>

		<p>Not enough people think ahead by centuries.  Fast forward three centuries.  What will North America look like?  At least as fragmented as Europe with dozens of separate countries, many at war with each other, and each having a predominate racial/ ethnic group.</p>
<p>Food shortages will be constant and acute.  Misery.  First world technology will have been long gone in the black and brown areas.  Foreign nations like the empire of China will control parts either directly or through client states.  Englanistan and Francabia will be at war with any remnants of white Europe.  Whites will be rare in Europe and north amerika, and found in the colder areas.</p>
<p>The ruins of white civilization will have been picked clean for resources and building materials.  The tribal griots and la raza priests will tell of a time when evil blue eyed devils roamed the land, oppressing the children of the earth and doing all manner of evil.</p>
<p>Before you dismiss this as idle fantasy.  Look at trends around you.  Think it through and consider our future, and how it didn&rsquo;t have to be that way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if there are going to be any White areas left in America.  Thirty years ago there many towns and counties that were 100 percent White and now I doubt you&rsquo;ll be able to locate one now.  Four years ago I moved to an upper South area to a town that was 97 percent White.  Today that percentage is down to 95 percent, still comfortable but it&rsquo;s obvious where the trend is heading.  How is this happening you might ask?  Well, one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is you see some couples with adopted kids, blacks and orientals.  Also a few mixed race couples appear every now and then.  Then there&rsquo;s the ethnic restaurants that pop up which coincide with the faces of new nonwhite kids I notice at the public schools.  Of course, there&rsquo;s some employers who bring in illegals for jobs and they hang around the check cashing places during certain times of the week.  Lastly, I increasingly see blacks walking up and down the streets so they obviously don&rsquo;t have cars so how did they get here?  I suspect the state capital is disbursing their welfare blacks out into the small towns to clear out the cities for the liberals. The way the demographics are shifting the town will be lucky if it&rsquo;s 70 percent White in 10 years. Of course, by then, large sections of town will turn into ghettos and Whites will stop taking leisurely strolls on the streets with their children and joggers will stay indoors on their treadmills.  This has got to stop.   </p>

		<p>The only area in which the U.S. has a trade surplus is agriculture.  This accounts for the Hispanic population boom.  They come here to work in agriculture.  The problem is, they bring along their Mamacitas who have anchor babies and dump them onto the taxpayers to support.  Their children then demand affirmative action jobs.  That is why there is no political will in the agri-states to deport them.  Not to mention, they are useful as cannon fodder.  We need to end NAFTA which would cut back on our agri exports to Latin America and try getting some manufacturing back.</p>
