			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gheni Platenburg, Victoria Advocate, March 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Melanie White {snip} is just one of a growing number of black women who are over 30 and still single. </p>
<p>A recent Yale study found 42 percent of African-American women remain unmarried, compared to only 23 percent of Caucasian women.</p>
<p>Deborrah Cooper, a relationship and dating advice columnist for the San Francisco Examiner, recently made claims on her popular blog, SurvivingDating.com, that predominantly black protestant churches, such as African Methodist, Pentecostal, and certain denominations of Evangelical and Baptist churches account for why so many black women are still single.</p>
<p>One controversial blog post in particular titled &#8220;The Black Church: How Black Churches Keep African-American Women Single and Lonely&#8221; attracted national attention for its claims that stringent beliefs established by the black church hinder black women in their search for love.</p>
<p>&#8220;An examination of any congregation of the average Black church shows that single black females fill the pews,&#8221; Cooper wrote. &#8220;Black women go to church week after week, hearing over and over again the message that they should be seeking a God-fearing man. Sisters in church are instructed by their pastor that there should be no room in their lives for a man without faith in the Lord.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Additional survey data showed that 62 percent of black Americans reportedly interpret scripture literally true word for word.</p>
<p>Those men who are single and in the church do not necessarily present good dating options either, according to Cooper&rsquo;s blog. </p>
<p>She described many of the single black men in church as being elderly reformed players, closeted homosexuals, opportunistic players or losers working on a 12-step program. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Admittedly, White said she has limited her dating pool to black Baptist men. </p>
<p>&#8220;I need someone who is a child of God, has been saved and has accepted God as the head of their life because He&rsquo;s definitely the head of mine,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>These dating criteria are something that Lydia Hobbs can relate to.</p>
<p>Hobbs, a 42-year-old mother of three, said a difference in religious beliefs is what led to her divorce from her husband of 11 years in 2004. </p>
<p>&#8220;Christianity is the most important aspect in a relationship, because I&rsquo;m a Christian&#8221; said Hobbs. &#8220;I was married to a non-Christian. Religion was not a main focus in his life. It was not important that he went to church or set moral standards for our children.&#8221; </p>
<p>Since getting back into the dating scene, Hobbs said anyone she considers dating must be Christian, have a job, do volunteer work, have a good personality and be attractive. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I just need someone who would not be afraid to pray with me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many single women are in church for women&rsquo;s groups, Bible study twice a week, some special committee meetings, singles ministry, fellowshipping through the community and attending service all day on Sunday. When exactly is it that this single black woman would have time for a man in her life?&#8221; Cooper asked in her blog. &#8220;In reality, she doesn&rsquo;t.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Perhaps religion plays a small role in why Black woman cannot seem to find husbands but I would also conjecture that the problem also could lie in the fact the numerous Black males are now residing behind bars and therefore are not available.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure these Black women who have 75 percent of their kids out of wedlock are really being hindered by their strict adherence to the 10 Commandments.</p>
<p>The real reason that Blacks don&rsquo;t marry is that local, state and federal programs provide for foods, clothing and (attempted) education. Not only are black males unnecessary, they may even be counter-productive and costly. A black male with a job (wow, hard to think of that, much less type it out) provides less than all the government goodies and gibs muh dat provided by white taxpayer money. Why be a chump and marry a black guy making minimum wage when you can get all the government goodies?<br>

<p>Is this true?  Most of the weep and wail articles about how blacks have problems are full of falsehoods, like the &#8220;little black girls like blond dolls therefore spend billions of dollars and destroy our greatest cities with a school busing program.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just because they&rsquo;re unmarried doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t have children; most probably do and they weren&rsquo;t necessarily married at the time. Any prospective mate must take into account the fact that he&rsquo;d have to support the children financially and potentially have to deal with the biological fathers when they show up. The woman may be expecting the man to cough up enough money to cover the expenses for herself, her children and himself whereas previously he only needed enough for himself. An awful lot of these black churchwomen look to me to be 200+ pounders, not quite the most fetching types. If there&rsquo;s no rush of guys to those churches looking for spouses then there&rsquo;s many reasons for that and it has little to do with what&rsquo;s being said from the pulpit.     </p>

		<p>&#8220;Black women have trouble finding black men who share their religious beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, so true.  </p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s not easy for a black female to find a male since a large portion of them are in the slammer, while many of the others are chasing after gullible white and Asian women, while the rest are casing their next job.</p>
<p>What is needed are federal funds to pay for the construction of dance halls that abut all the jails, with cocktail lounges in the back.</p>
<p>After that, if black women still just can&rsquo;t find black men they need to become more innovative and start dating web sites that draw black males with names like probation.com; community service.com; parole violators anonymous.org; failure to appear.com; and off the honkies.com would draw a lot of men who are rap fans.  </p>
<p>But &#8220;assault and bettery for fun and profit.com&#8221; would be a sure winner. &#8220;Someone to talk to, when your last mugging leaves you unfulfilled and dissatisfied&#8221; could offer telephone contacts, with the cautionary warning on the site to a prospective member that if she notices someone peeking in her windows quite often, she might want to move ASAP and get an unlisted telephone number before rejoining.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Okay, this sentence is just too funny. Roughly 70% of African American women give birth to children out of wedlock. Deuteronomy 23:2 says &#8220;No one of illegitimate birth nor any of their descendants may enter the assembly of the Lord, not even in the tenth generation.&#8221; And as Jesus once said, &#8220;I have not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it,&#8221; which obviously means the Old Testament isn&rsquo;t irrelevant.</p>
<p>I guess most black women missed Deuteronomy 23:2.</p>

		<p>Most blacks women and sadly single for other reasons, the one stated being last on the list probably.</p>
<p>Black women are statistically the fattest demographic in the U.S., they are stereotyped as rude and loud (for good reason), and they are considered the least attractive race (even by black men).  So the majority of non-blacks do not want to marry a black woman, so that leaves black men.</p>
<p>Black women have known and grow up around black men.  They know all their tricks and what they are really like.  For that reason black women do not put up with black men&rsquo;s shenanigans like females of other races.</p>

		<p>My wife and I were in an upscale, lovely restuarant in a major city back in January. The number of Black women versus Black men in the restaurant was shockingly notable. </p>
<p>We only saw two Black couples and they looked to be well into middle age. But we saw at least 4 times as many Black women as we did men. Most of the women were very well dressed. I overheard a couple of the waiters (White males, probably late 20ish to early 30ish) making conversation with a group of several very attractive, well drerssed Black women who were sitting a few tables away from me. I heard them mention the fact that they were attorneys at a local law firm. </p>
<p>After we had left the restaurant, my wife and I discussed the fact that we saw so many seemingly upscale Black women and hardly any suitable, comparable Black men. </p>
<p>This does nor bode well for professional Black women in as far as finding compatable mates for marriage.  </p>

Actually, I have seen and met a numbeer of attractive Black women. A number of them have been bi-racial and those who were darker skinned tended to be upper income (like the bi-racial ones I met), but I have nonetheless, met some very intelligent, pleasant and attractive Black women.  </p>

		<p>As a single white 22-year-old male I feel as though I am at ground zero of the divide between blacks and whites inter-dating with each other. For a long time I have noticed how easily the young white female will fall easily for the black male. This is especiecllly true for the surburban white females, which are mostly cheerleaders for their highschool. </p>
<p>Looking back on my relationship and dating resume I have come to the conclusion that as a young white male my chances of landing a white female as a mate is dwindiling because the black and other non-white males essentially snatch them away from my demographic. I will not deny that there are beutiful non-white females, but my biggest problem with black males and white females dating each other is that it will eventually leave only black females open for marriage. </p>
<p>Among all of the races of women, I find the black female to be the least attractive. They are usually rude, loud, bullying, over bearing, obese and too lazy to live with. This is not always the case, but for the most part it is true. The way I see it is if black women do not like being the most single of all females, they need to change their act. They need to assimilate more into white culture and adopt white female mannerisms. If not, they are destined to forever be the most passed over of all the world&rsquo;s female racial groups. </p>
<p>However, as more and white women fall to the temptaion of black men, other non-white females have stepped in to fill their void. Every where you look you see white men qwith Asian and Latino females, but not black females. Honestly, I used to be really opposed to interacial marriage, but as I have gotten older and crave a woman&rsquo;s company I am more exceptable to being attractive to olive skinned women because they are the only game in town and they are attractive.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am being biased because I am white, but it seems to me that whites are looked upon as the ultimate prize in regards to being a mate for a non-white person. Whether you are male or female, you are always guranteed to find a prospective mate among non-whites. Why this is the case I do not understand, but it appears to me that since white are the most successful of all races perhaps they figure that by aquiring our genes they will gain our standing. Who knows? What I am trying to get is that as a younf white male I get hit on by more blacks girls then white girls. For example, when ever I ask a young white girl out on a date they treat me like an unclean thing, but black girls seem to be more open. </p>

		<p>I work at an advertising firm in a large southwestern city. We have a large staff of late twentysomethings, 90% White. A lot of them are single and are still actively dating. Moreover I hear several of them talking about dating outside their race. The manner in which they talk about it is almost passe. It seems to be fairly commonplace or at least, no big deal to them.</p>

		<p>Leave it to the left to blame Christianity for black spinsterhood!  I&rsquo;ve worked with several black women and one white woman who met their black husbands in church.  <br>
The reason so many black females remain unwed is because so many black males are just plain no good.  They keep a stable of girlfriends and avoid all responsibility. Usually, they don&rsquo;t wed their white sex partners anymore than they do their black ones. Almost all women of any ethnicity want to be married, but non-black males usually prefer non-black females.  Thus, the pool of marriageable men is lessened greatly for black women.  </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, lots of women with illegitimate kids (of all races) get more freebies if single.  Many will say the father is unknown on birth certificates.  But for well employed black women we all know why it&rsquo;s hard for them to find a good black husband.</p>

<p>I remember about two or three years ago, a lady posting under the heading &#8220;Please date and Marry White, White People&#8221; mentioning the fact that she was waiting for a taxi to take her to a hotel for a conference that she was attending in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>In her post she mentioned the fact that on two benches down from her there was an elegant looking Black woman wearing an expensive designer dress. A few minutes later a lexus drove up and an extremely attractive, well built, White man wearing khaki pants and a arrow shirt with two bi-racial boys (according to her, they were obviously brothers) who looked to be 6 and 8  years old. She further mentioned that the man walked up the  woman, said &#8220;hello honey&#8221; they then kissed and she gave her sons big hugs calllng them &#8220;my cute little babies.&#8221;  </p>
<p>They then apparently put their sons in the car, fastened their children&rsquo;s seatbelts, got int he car themselves, fastened their own seatbelts and took off. The poster stated that the experience upset her so much that she was hardly able to eat anything for most of that day. </p>
<p>My point is that this apparently happened in Philadelphia a few years ago. Thus, I am not surprised that you witnessed a noticeable number of White male/Black female couples.</p>
<p>This trend has obviously been taking place for quite some time. </p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly 36 percent of black Americans are obese – much more than other major racial or ethnic groups – and that gap exists in most states, a new federal study finds&hellip;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>And I could not find the one about black men finding white women more attractive than blacks.  But studies have been done worldwide and the white woman is considered the most attractive more than any other.  While I do not speak for all blacks, I would put it that 80% black men in the metro Detroit area prefer whites girls.  This is based on personal experience and stories from friends.</p>
<p>To look at a broader opinion, just google &#8220;which race is the most attractive&#8221;.  Again, whites usually win.</p>
<p>As for the loud and rude part, that is just personal experience that is tried and true in my life in every part of the world I have been to.  </p>
<p>Lastly, evidence of marriage licenses prove that black women marry the least outside of the race.  When surveys are done they are usually polled to looking for other races for husbands, but can never find a man of another race to marry them.  I know I get hit on a ton by black women.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is largely overblown mythological nonsense&#8221;</p>
<p>I think not.  It is a mix of statistical fact and my experience (and almost every white friend/family member I have) in life.  Could you say it was a matter of opinion?  Yes, but only so much.  Overblown?  No.  Nonsense?  No.</p>

		<p>A black female with a decent job and several children from one or more &#8220;previous relationships&#8221; has very little incentive to &#8220;settle&#8221; for a loser from the black male population.  The typical black male will just steal from her and abuse her children, and the typical black female in her late 20s/early 30s has already figured this out.</p>
<p>Back in the olden days, when out-of-wedlock births were socially unacceptable, women felt they HAD to get married or give up on motherhood as well as matrimony.  Now that marriage and children have become de-linked, even in white society, black women often choose to have children early in life, THEN start looking for a man to marry.  It is seldom a successful strategy, but at least they end up with children.  A lot of white women postpone marriage AND kids and end up with nothing.</p>

		<p>What the string of anecdotes about white men and black women show me is this: black women, as a whole, are obese and unattractive. But, the minority who do pull themselves together and get a job and career vastly outnumber the black men who do. Since they have virtually no black male colleagues, a large number end up marrying white men, although even more remain single like Condi Rice. (The much smaller number of with-it black men, meanwhile, are still even more likely to marry white women.)</p>
<p>In other words, most white male-black female mixing is more of the yuppie type, while the white female-black male mixing, which still outnumbers the reverse by about 2.5:1 in marriages   &mdash;   even more if counting cohabitation   &mdash;   is primarily the unwed, low-class type.</p>

<p>Your first paragraph is especially prescient.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a nature documentary about the lives and habits of lions?  The lion is the only really social cat species.  When a new male lion takes over a pride of females, he does two things:  First, ejects young adult and adolescent males out of the pride, to eliminate competition for his leadership.  Two, he kills the females&rsquo; cubs that were sired by the previous male pride leader, so that the females don&rsquo;t have the distraction anymore and can therefore mate with him, to pass on his genes.</p>
<p>This kind of thing presents itself among human beings as well.</p>
<p>Pay close attention to the news.  Whenever you hear about an infant child being murdered, it is almost always at the hands of the child&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s relatively new boyfriend.  And these aren&rsquo;t coincidental anecdotes either:  Laura Schlessinger once reported the stat that the infanticide rate in step-families is 60 times higher than it is in &#8220;traditional&#8221; nuclear families.  And yes, there are racial differences in this sort of thing.  However, I&rsquo;ve seen a number of these kinds of stories involving upper middle class white people.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find the second phenomenon, but you have to look closer.  Fortunately, I have done just that and found the evidence.  In 2006, a school district in a St. Louis suburb whose high school student body is virtually all black opened up a special home for jettisoned teenage boys who were students at that school, (Maplewood-Richmond Hts for you STLers in here), and the home is called &#8220;Joe&rsquo;s Place.&#8221;  It was in the news a few days ago around here because a documentary is being made about it.  Anyway, when it first opened, the local do-gooders who were raising money for it and running it admitted that so many teenage boys who went to MRH HS were homeless because their mothers threw them out at the insistence of the mother&rsquo;s new live-in boyfriends.  They didn&rsquo;t explicitly mention race, but any idiot could put the 2 and 2 together.  </p>
<p>Since then, I have found a few other examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4h84m2j" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/4h84m2j</a><br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/496t75g" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/496t75g</a></p>
<p>Unlike the infanticide part, I have never heard or seen a story like this involving non-blacks.  Maybe it does, and I just haven&rsquo;t seen it yet.  Maybe someone in here has seen such a story.  </p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re right   &mdash;   Such black women probably are thinking more about their infant children (of either gender) or their teenage sons.  Or if they have teenage daughters, maybe they&rsquo;re worried that their new &#8220;boo&#8221; would think about the teenage daughter as &#8220;side action.&#8221;  So they&rsquo;re altruistically avoiding relationships with black men.</p>

<p>Not surprising, considering Bantus and lions come from the same continent, Africa.</p>
<p>In fact, most of what humans do, is a result of copying animals in nature. Thousands of years ago, a Neanderthal looked up at a soaring bird, and wondered what it would be like to fly like that bird. Flight was born.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s ancestors also wondered what it would be like to swim like a fish. Marine travel was eventually born.</p>
<p>Burying the dead came from man&rsquo;s ancestors trying to protect the corpse from being devoured by four-legged predators.</p>

<p>Yeah, we&rsquo;re seeing this here in California, not infrequently, among the Latino population.  The mother is only too happy to either hand her child over to the grandmother to raise or let the new boyfriend do as he will with the child(ren).</p>
<p>I have plenty of Latino kids in my classroom who are either in foster care or living with the grandmother as their own mother is off with a new boyfriend.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how devastating this is to kids, to be rejected by their own mothers in favor of a new boyfriend.</p>
<p>These are both recent cases:</p>
<p>SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (CBS/AP) <i>Antonio Rodriguez has been sentenced to death for sexually assaulting and beating to death his girlfriend&rsquo;s 5-year-old daughter.</i></p>
<p>SAN JUAQUIN, Calif:  <i>Authorities say Jacob Leon was beaten to death by his mother&rsquo;s new boyfriend, Mario Pena.</i></p>
<p>The DA comes to my school once a year to give the grim statistics, <i>including pictures of abuse</i> viz. boyfriends who kill their girlfriend&rsquo;s babies or little children via torture, beatings, repeated rapings, scalding, shakings, or worse, often with the mother present. standing by or even complicit. More concerned with &#8220;losing her man&#8221; than her own child. Some of the babies are as young as three months. </p>
<p>The DA tells me the <b>only</b> thing that stops them is JAIL.  Nothing else.  Counseling, anger management, 12-step programs are useless and worthless and DO NOT WORK. Only removing them from the human population works.</p>

		<p>A lot of white men that like Asian women are particulary fond of petite women, which a good portion of Asian women tend to be. Also since many Asian women do not come from a Christian backgrounds except for Koreans, they do not have any hangups about premarital sex, which used to be a cultural taboo but not any more.</p>

<p>In other words, most white male-black female mixing is more of the yuppie type, while the white female-black male mixing, which still outnumbers the reverse by about 2.5:1 in marriages  &mdash;  even more if counting cohabitation  &mdash;  is primarily the unwed, low-class type.</p>

<p>This has been my experience.</p>

<p>This was the story I heard.</p>
<p><br>
You heard right. Several newspapers mentioned this fact. Several otf them had Asian and Hispanic girlfriends as well. In fact, it was reported that Reade Seligman, one of the accused lacrosse players dated a Black female and that they were seen frequently eating breakfast together and hanging out at various coffeeshops near the Duke campus.  </p>

		<p>I really would not be all that concerned if the White men who were dating or involved with Black women were the obese, truck driving, tobacco chewing bubba types. As far as I am concerned there is not much difference between them and low class Black men. Most White women would be much better off without them.</p>
<p>What is most troubling is that is seems that the White male/Black female parings (or at least the ones that I have witnessed) tend to be White men who are the more desirable types - good loooking, mostly in shape, intelligent, cultured, etc&hellip; The type of men that would make A-list husbands for many White women and would keep the White gene pool strong. </p>
<p>It is indeed sad to see these men betray our race in this manner.</p>

		<p>Bah, it&rsquo;s irritating to see the personal stories of &#8220;oh no I saw the odd racial couple or two this one time several months ago, the world is ENDING!&#8221; in the comments section.</p>
<p>Honestly, look at statistics.  Interracial marriages have remained largely static in number for the last few years, and whites marry out of their race the least of all groups.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a happy personal story: Just a few days ago I saw several young looking white couples, all with more than one white child(in two of the three cases - they had more than two!), and this is in Fort Worth, Texas, of all places!</p>
<p>As for the white guys talking about marrying out of their race on Amren of all places, I&rsquo;m honestly ashamed.  I&rsquo;m twenty two myself and have never even considered such a thing a possibility.  There&rsquo;s a word for people like you, it&rsquo;s defeatist.  If you can&rsquo;t find a white woman, you aren&rsquo;t looking hard enough.  Personally, I&rsquo;m more concerned with finding a bloody job!</p>

<p>Before any of my fellow white males out there decide to bash white women any more than they already have, I&rsquo;d like to point out that according to studies &#8220;Women of all the races which were studied revealed a strong preference for men of their own race for marriage, with the caveat that East Asian women only discriminated against Black and Hispanic men, and not against White men.  A woman&rsquo;s race was found to have no effect on the men&rsquo;s choices.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reason for that probably has less to do with racial loyalty than it has to do with age. As women age they realize that they can&rsquo;t &#8216;play&rsquo; as hard as they used to during their younger years, and so gradually they get serious about &#8216;settling down&rsquo; and becoming a devoted child of the Lord. Their racial preferences mostly reflect these realities; it likely has little to do with aversion to sex outside of the race. It&rsquo;s just pragmatism in the service of security.</p>

<p>I just got back from a shopping expedition. I saw at least as many white women with black fathered babies as I saw with white fathered babies. I saw as many black women with babies as white women. Marriage statistics are irrelevant in a society with massive out-of-wedlock birthing.</p>

		<p>I agree that there are far more black women with decent jobs and educations that there are black men with decent jobs and educations.  Here at the community college where I work it is almost as rare to see a black male employee as it is to see a White male employee.</p>
<p>There is one reason and only one reason black women have better jobs than black men.  Affirmative Action.  The law requires that black women rather than black men be given jobs.</p>
<p>For affirmative action hiring, black men are just about in the same place as White women.  Only after all the minority women are hired may a black man or White woman be hired.</p>
<p>That is of course, if some *&^%# Judge has not ordered the employeer to bring in foreign woman or scour the country for American Indians or foreign nationals or just about anything but a black or White American man or a White American woman.</p>

&#8220;I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of black men say they only date women of other races because black women are rude, loud, obnoxious, stupid, lazy, crude and bossy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a white woman, 68 years old.  My hair is white, I&rsquo;ve never had a facelift and look my age.  Many black men have told me they don&rsquo;t like the loud control freak typical black woman.  Because of my age and appearance I know they guys are not coming on to me.  Quite a few black men have told me they don&rsquo;t want their children raised by the typical physically and verbally abusive black mother.  &#8220;I don&rsquo;t want my kids to go through what I went through&#8221; is their reasoning. <br>

Single mothers are raising them. Single mothers are more likely to raise violent street criminals than are married women, because they have less control over teenage boys than a father would have. <br>
 <br>
The black illegitimacy rate is high, but the white illegitimacy rate is as high as the black rate was in 1960. The social costs of illegitimacy are one of the end result of the sexual revolution. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a single white male 23 years old. Dating is hard for us young folks, Kytim89. Your post resonated with me especially about how hard it is.</p>
<p>While some white women are dating black men, I don&rsquo;t think this is a universal as people make it. However I do think that whites are higher up in the sexual hierarchy in terms of sexual selection. Many are competing for them. Combining with the fact that men compete for women it becomes harder and harder for white men to find white women.</p>
<p>Besides from many Californian women being pretty bad at times, I find that many of them have boyfriends. They mostly tend to be with people similar to them. I don&rsquo;t keep count but this is just anecdotal.</p>
<p>Of course this isn&rsquo;t saying that all white women are attractive or blacks are unattractive, but there is however a groupings and those groupings tend to deviate.</p>
<p>However I will say that most black women, as bad as southern Californian white women can be, have an attitude that you wouldn&rsquo;t believe. Hell, even when I was &#8220;anti racist&#8221; I still wouldn&rsquo;t date them. Black women are that bad. The exception are those who came directly from Africa, in terms of personality.</p>
<p>Personally, I will say that other women of other races can be attractive, but I have always been intrinsically more attracted to people Caucasians. Although exoticism was prevalent (mostly in diverse white peoples), I can say black were least attractive and from and evolutionary point of view it is not hard to see why. We are more divergent from them.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m like Kytim89, getting tired of the dating. Every girl&rsquo;s got bfs.</p>

		<p>The churches in general have become somewhat exclusionary for men (and I mean all men, regardless of their race). The doors may technically be open to all, but spend an hour singing &#8220;I am in love with Jesus&#8221; music, sitting around the floral prints everywhere, and hearing the message to be passive just doesn&rsquo;t resonate with a lot of men period. </p>
<p>Other than the much larger income, education, and prison record gap between black women, and black men; the situation repeats itself in many white churches. Gone is Jesus the radical man of action, he has been replaced with &#8220;Jesus is my boyfriend&#8221;. The guys sitting around the churches are largely the ones that their wife had to drag them there, the elderly, the disabled, and a few teenagers &amp; twenty somethings dragged along by their mom.  I see exceptions to this, but its rare. More often I can count the blank expression of boredom on the faces of the men at church, and almost hear them wishing &#8220;When do we get to the action part of this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Calling my query &#8220;overblown&#8221; is a wimpy red herring you are tossing out to deflect blame from yourself because you cannot present a source that the Duke boys dated nonwhites.</p>

<p><i>Wayne mentioned Black, Hispanic and Asian women. You seem to leave out the fact that he stated Asian women as well.</i></p>
<p>You are being ridiculous because you cannot present a source for your information and are twisting yourself into knots to deflect attention and blame for your shortcomings. </p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t work that way here, especially on me.</p>
<p>Now, present your sources and facts to back up what you&rsquo;ve written, not your assumptions or things you assume it is &#8220;safe&#8221; to say.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t think anyone would call you on your little premise did you?  But I will every single time I see any bashing of whites.</p>
<p><i>Thus, your hostility to his post gives the assumption that it would be okay if they had dated Asian women, but inappropriate if they were involved with Black or Hispanic women. Asian women are still non-White women.</i></p>
<p>Hostile?   But, your attack is not hostile, right?  That I asked you a perfectly legitimate question is &#8220;hostile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then&hellip;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s end this:  Present a source for what you wrote: that the Duke boys dated nonwhite women.</p>
<p>You have nothing because if you did, you would present it, to belittle whites, especially white males, and to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>You have nothing and you know it so YOU go on the attack against ME for questioning you.  Typical lefty.  And it won&rsquo;t work here, especially on me.</p>
<p><i>This is very hypocritical on your part.</i></p>
<p>Another typical lefty tactic: Attack ANYONE questioning your assumptions, which you believe if repeated enough make them true.  Anyone who disagrees with you  must be a &#8220;hypocrite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calling me a hypocrite does not absolve you of dodging my question:  Present your source of information.</p>
<p>Maybe from now on you&rsquo;ll think twice before assuming something is &#8220;safe&#8221; to write or say because YOU think it is, assuming no one will ever call you on your assumptions.</p>
<p>Expect me to call you out every single time I see something stupid posted here about whites without a legitimate source to back it up.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d better think twice before writing anything that debases whites because I will call you on it.  Every. Single. Time.  And I will be here waiting and watching.</p>
