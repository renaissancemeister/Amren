			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Gaffney Jr., Canada Free Press, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is not everyday that Congress breaks a major taboo and, in so doing, performs a real service to the nation. Last Thursday, however, was one such day: Representative Pete King (Republican of New York) demonstrated impressive leadership in convening and conducting a four-hour-long hearing on &#8220;extremism&#8221; in the American Muslim community.</p>
<p>For his efforts, the Homeland Security Committee&rsquo;s chairman was subjected to tremendous personal attacks and partisan sniping  &mdash;  the wages of taboo-busting. While those responsible for inflicting such slanderous criticism claim, in the words of one group, to have &#8220;defeat[ed] a major threat of Islamophobia,&#8221; the real story is that Mr. King began a conversation about an issue that has long been deemed politically untouchable. He also established that there is, indeed, a problem of &#8220;extremism&#8221; within the American Muslim community.<br>
One manifestation of that problem was the determined effort made by the so-called &#8220;leadership&#8221; of the Muslim population in this country not only to impugn the chairman and several of his witnesses, but to suppress these hearings altogether. For example, groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) lined up fifty-five House Democrats to insist that Rep. King &#8220;reconsider the scope of these hearings and instead examine all forms of violence motivated by extremist beliefs, rather than unfairly focusing on just one religious group.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this demand became clear as Pete King&rsquo;s witnesses shed light on the true nature of such self-appointed Muslim &#8220;leaders&#8221;: They do not speak for American Muslims and are either directly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood  &mdash;  an organization whose mission is to &#8220;destroy Western civilization from within&#8221;  &mdash;  or sympathetic to its goal of bringing shariah to the United States.</p>
<p>Relatives of two young men who were recruited, indoctrinated and sent to engage in jihad provided frightening insights into the ways in which Muslim organizations, mosques, cultural centers and Islamic societies stealthily advance this objective. One means is via dawa  &mdash;  the proselytization of the politico-military-legal doctrine of shariah.</p>
<p>Particularly chilling was the account of a Somali-American living in Minnesota by the name of Abdirizak Bihi. His nephew, Burhan Hassan, was among those who joined and was killed fighting on behalf of the Islamist terrorist group al Shabab in Somalia. He relayed how his family was warned by community &#8220;leaders&#8221; not to go to the authorities for help lest they wind up in Guantanamo Bay or facing &#8220;eternal fire and hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was this an isolated incident? Hardly. At least since the immediate aftermath of 9/11, prominent Muslim American organizations have encouraged their co-religionists not to cooperate with law enforcement. Among the most recent examples was a message on a CAIR website calling on its members to &#8220;Build a Wall of Resistance. Don&rsquo;t Talk to the FBI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, this narrative contrasts sharply with that promoted by the Muslim Public Affairs Council and its ilk who take credit for successfully inseminating into the U.S. media the meme that they are actively &#8220;engaging&#8221; with law enforcement. Notably, MPAC takes credit for getting Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca called to testify at the King hearing for the purpose of attesting to their good citizenship.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for both the officer sporting a uniform with five stars and his Islamist friends, freshman Rep. Chip Cravaak (Republican of Minnesota) asked whether the sheriff was aware of CAIR&rsquo;s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s franchise in Palestine, known as Hamas. The sheriff professed to know nothing of those associations. When Rep. Cravaak pointed out that the Department of Justice has demonstrated in federal court that such ties do exist, Sheriff Baca demurred and simply said, if there is that evidence, then such individuals, such organizations ought to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Well, no kidding. They certainly should be prosecuted. And here is a question that future hearings of the Homeland Security Committee should address: Why hasn&rsquo;t the Council on American Islamic relations been prosecuted for being tied to Hamas, for working on behalf of the Muslim Brotherhood and specifically for fostering the efforts to bring shariah to America? After all, shariah is a seditious ideology and totalitarian program explicitly designed to hollow out, and ultimately to destroy, representative government and the civil liberties that are enshrined in our Constitution. There is every reason for such a prosecution to go forward, and we need to know why has not it happened to date.</p>
<p>There was one other evident reason why the Muslim Brotherhood&rsquo;s front groups were so determined to shut down the King hearings and excoriate him for having as witnesses anybody other than their hand-picked candidates  &mdash;  the blubbering first-Muslim-in-Congress Rep. Keith Ellison (a Democrat from Minnesota) and the clueless Sheriff Baca: Rep. King helped credential Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, a former naval officer and founder of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, as a credible and inspiring voice for pro-American Muslims and Islamic reform.</p>
<p>We owe Pete King a debt of gratitude for defying those who would have shut him up and shut his hearings down. In so doing, he has laid bare important truths about the threat posed by shariah and its adherents, empowered those like Dr. Jasser who are courageously standing up against it and broken a taboo in a way that cries out for many more hearings, as soon as possible, on these and related subjects, by his committee and by others.<br>

		<p>Personally, I found these hearings to be rather lackluster and deficient.</p>
<p>The main reason is one I stated here several days ago   &mdash;   Echoing Jupiter, I find the terrorism issue and the issue of &#8220;good Muslims&#8221; or &#8220;non-terrorist Muslims&#8221; or &#8220;moderate Muslims&#8221; vs &#8220;bad Muslims&#8221; or &#8220;terrorist Muslims&#8221; to be a red herring in the big big scheme of things.  Terrorist or not, fundamentalist or not, moderate or radical, good or bad, secular or religious, there is no good reason to have as much as one non-white post-1965 legal immigrant Muslim in the United States.  Every single one of them, even if opposed to terrorism, fundamentalism, etc., contribute to the economic and social dispossession of native born white Americans.</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t worry, Jupiter.  Your royalty check is on the way.)</p>
<p>The second reason is that I wish King would have hired some forensic accountants and cracked open the books on CAIR, and some of the big mouths who were mouthing off against him having these hearings.  I bet there&rsquo;s a money trail between they and Saudi Arabia.</p>

Naturally, African-Americas were out front defending their peace-love, bloodless-hands, Muslim brothers because blacks are desperate to form any alliance with any non-white to take down the white man.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny that blacks want us to learn lessons from slavery but they never seem to learn their own lessons from their own history and behavior. When has a black take-over of a white nation or community benefited blacks in the long run? After 10, maybe 20 years of black rule or black control, black nations and black neighborhoods devolve.<br>

		<p>Four hours?  A hearing that wants to get to the bottom of a dangerous problem effecting national security and it is given only 4 hours?  Ha! Hillarious.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, this was to be a &#8220;taboo buster,&#8221; making it easier to have others in the future, but I&rsquo;m betting the roar on anything else on the same subject will cause an even greater uproar.</p>
<p>When an empire has lost the power to investigate insidious elements within that seriously threaten acts of violent overthrow of the existing regime, then that pitiful entity is on the way out.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question about it.</p>
<p>Escaping to sovereign communities is the only answer.  Hunkering down with like-minded people, while allowing the crazies to kill each other off is the only intelligent alternative.  </p>

<p>contrary to your statement, it is eminently reasonable to distinguish between good and bad Muslim immigrants, and between good and bad non-European immigrants (not to mention between bad and good European immigrants. by the way, we are MUCH better off with Chinese medical technicians than Russian or Bulgarian gangsters, no matter how white).</p>
<p>you are entitled to your opinion that all nonwhite immigration should cease, but that does not entitle you to lump a Jewish dentist from Iran, a Chinese architect, a Korean neurosurgeon, an Indian civil engineer together with Islamic terrorists.</p>
<p>the former category perform important services and add to the expertise of the society while the same time, arguably, displacing native from certain jobs (or the creating a more competitive job situation for dentists, civil engineers, etc.)</p>
<p>this may be a problem, but it is not on the same level with Islamic terrorism, nor with a militant, anti-Western movement designed to overthrow our way of life.<br>

<p>SEE! we still don&rsquo;t get it! there is NO SUCH THING AS A PEACEFUL MUSLIM! They will ALWAYS side with their Quran and against liberty and especially, Christianity. A former naval officer!!! as if that means anything in a politically correct military and we know full well what muslims in uniform are capable of by now, RIGHT!</p>

		<p>Funny how the &#8220;real&#8221; muslims or Mohammedans, sunni, shiite, or whatever, are always lumped together with the &#8220;Black Muslims&#8221; by seemingly everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Nation of Islam is an African-American religious movement founded in Detroit, Michigan, by Wallace D. Fard Muhammad in July 1930.&#8221;  &mdash;  wikipedia</p>
<p>Similar to those who mix up Christian Scientists and Scientologists, I guess.</p>

		<p>Peter King has a history of attaking the Patriotic Immigration Reform Movement. He did it in a letter to the Editor to the NR in the late 1990s. </p>
<p>Worse than 9/11-and the earlier attack in Nov 1993-will be a very large Muslim &#8220;American&#8221; population in America..an &#8220;America&#8221; with a rapidly  dwindling Native Born White American population. The high fertility Muslim &#8220;American&#8221; population will be armed and dangerous-the &#8220;US&#8221; military will provide the best weapons training that Native Born White Amerians can subsidize..in fact they will have full access the most lethal military infrastructure that ever known to mankind&hellip;evntually there will be submarine commander named Captian Mohammad&hellip;he is very likely studying at the &#8220;US&#8221; Naval Academy at this very moment. None of this bothers Congressman Peter King. In fact, he has voted for this pre-9/11 and post-9/11&hellip;he has voted for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority at the hands of post-1965 Muslims and other high fertility nonwhite immigrants groups. But this is what you get when you vote Republican at election time&hellip;.race-treason. What a bunch of sociopaths.</p>
<p>The Fort Hood massacre was direct consequence of Peter King&rsquo;s and every other sociopathic and treasonous Republican and Democratic politician&rsquo;s vote for nonwhite legal immigration.</p>
<p>So the question that the Patriotic Immigration Reform movement should be asking about Peter King is this:Why does he vote for the rapid expansion of the Muslim population in America? There are no economic,demographic,cultural and ecological reasons for allowing the Muslim population in America to expand.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans should not be forced to share the scarce resources-such as access to Yellow Stone and the Adirondacks-of America with the young Muslim couples in America and Muslims in the Middle East and Bosnia who want to come to America to start a  Muslim &#8220;American&#8221; family. Really, it is cultural and racial blasphemy.</p>

<p>Contrary to your race-replacement enthusiasm:just as in the case of Muslim legal immigrants, there are no economic,ecological and demogaphic reasons for importing Asian engineers,programmers and doctors. How did Native Born White Americans ever manage to survive when there were hardly any Iranian dentists and Asian engineers,programmers and doctors in America? Very well, thank you.</p>
<p>You are free to move to Iran,China,Korea,India and Pakistan. I promise not to stop you from going. But you are not allowed to extend Iran&rsquo;s,China&rsquo;s,Pakistan,Korea&rsquo;s and India&rsquo;s genetic borders deep inside of America, a majority Native Born White American Nation. We did not consent to being race-replaced by high fertility Iranians,Pakistan,Koreans,Hindus and Koreans. We are not going to commit racial suicide within the borders of America because it would make the aforementioned groups-and Congressmen Peter King-very happy.</p>
<p>What was the race of the twelve Men who walked on the Moon? Native Born White American of course. What was the racial composition of NASA during the Saturn and Apollo programs? Around 99.9 percent Native Born White American. Someone is telling quite a big lie about Native Born White Americans.</p>

<p>Like I said in an earlier AR story, the Republicans in Congress could have just as easily held these hearings within a year of 9/11 happening.  But I think they held back because they didn&rsquo;t want to call attention to President Bush&rsquo;s deficiencies, so they waited until they had both control of at least one chamber of Congress AND there was a Democrat in the White House.  Which is now.</p>

<p>You have an interesting point. But it&rsquo;s irrelevant!  Ultimately, it  just amounts  to  quibblng over which form of death and displacement you would prefer. By analogy, it may be done by a painless injection, or by by  a vicious stabbing;  but either way the  end results are the same. They both end in the demise and extinction of our people, to be replaced by others.</p>
<p>Naturally, the painless way seems preferable; but why should we  have to choose EITHER?</p>
<p>How did the USA manage to function when we provided <i> our own</i> architects, surgeons, and engineers? Were we a backward country then, before the massive infusion of what you call  foreign &#8220;expertise&#8221;?  (Btw, most of that foreign &#8220;expertise&#8221; was learned or  developed right here or elsewhere in the Western world. So we&rsquo;re only &#8220;importing&#8221; it from ourselves   &mdash;   but in the form of other persons than our own, who have learned it from us.)</p>

They probably dismiss it, minimize it, ignore it, or don&rsquo;t believe it.  (Just white man&rsquo;s propaganda, you know.)</p>
<p>As for slavery, they very actively resisted its abolition   &mdash;   and still do!  (In Africa, that is.   But blacks abusing other blacks is  always another matter   &mdash;   no racial aspect to exploit. American &#8220;blacks&#8221;, from their perspective, see EVERYTHING in terms of black vs.white. When it&rsquo;s blacks against blacks, there&rsquo;s no issue. And in America race is the big issue.)</p>
<p>We have to see things in the larger picture as to what is REALLY going on. America is a continent whose possession is under contest by various races. (As Europe soon will be.) All the propaganda to get us to accept others and co-exist, is just propaganda to numb our resistance until the other elements have grown stronger - and we weaker.</p>
