<h1><a href="http://www.wtop.com/?sid=2290081&amp;nid=">GOP: Illegal Immigrants Taking Minorities&rsquo; Jobs</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Suzanne Gamboa, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), March 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black lawmakers accused Republicans on Tuesday of trying to &#8220;manufacture tension&#8221; between African-Americans and immigrants as GOP House members argued in a hearing that more minorities would be working were it not for illegal immigration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;I am concerned by the majority&rsquo;s attempt to manufacture tension between African-Americans and immigrant communities. It seems as though they would like for our communities to think about immigration in terms of &#8216;us versus them,&rsquo; and I reject that notion,&#8221; Cleaver [Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Mo., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus] said in his statement.</p>
<p>Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, issued a warning at the start of the hearing against any attempts to pit blacks against Latino immigrants, a notion that he said he found &#8220;so abhorrent and repulsive.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Republican takeover of the House has given the GOP the chance to shape the immigration debate this session. Republicans have been couching their immigration agenda in the context of the slumping economy and consistently high unemployment. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Mo., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus</p>
<p>Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif., the subcommittee&rsquo;s chairman, argued that the &#8220;real victims of the failed immigration policies&#8221; are low-skilled legal workers. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, D-Mo., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus should be on ensuring every U.S. citizen American who is willing to work has a job instead of (filling) jobs with foreign laborers,&#8221; Gallegly said. Immigrants often compete for jobs with low-income laborers, he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, pointed out that after Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided Georgia Crider Inc., which had 600 jobs filled by people not working in the country legally, the company raised wages $1 an hour and attracted legal workers, primarily black Americans.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Wade Henderson, chairman and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, acknowledged that because of the higher unemployment in their communities, African-Americans fear the immigrant work force will make it harder for them to get jobs.</p>
<p>Henderson said high unemployment among blacks has a wide variety of causes. Unemployment rates for more than 50 years have been almost double what they are for white Americans, he said, even as the population of foreign-born people in the U.S. has increased.</p>

		<p>Black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; keep hoping for some grand alliance of black and brown that will eventually unseat whitey.  What black people do not realize is that latinos have no love for blacks and no respect for them.  Just look at how latinos treat blacks or darker skinned latinos in their OWN countries.</p>
<p>Latinos, and I know this from tons of experience, are so racist against blacks as to hardly be believed.  If blacks think that losing compton is bad, wait until they are driven out completely of the entire western half of the country.</p>

		<p>Apparently, black politicians have no more interest in the long term welfare of black constituents than white politicians have for white men.</p>
<p>Notice that the Republicans only focus on <i>illegal</i> immigrants, as if the legals don&rsquo;t inflict even more damage, but it is mainly to white men. </p>

		<p>Three major problems with this:</p>
<p>(1) Most blacks aren&rsquo;t really interested in working anyway, at least not in the kinds of jobs immigrants do.</p>
<p>(2) There&rsquo;s tension aplenty between blacks and Latinos already, without need for the GOP or anyone else to manufacture more. As blacks are on the losing end of it, the subject is a sensitive one with them.</p>
<p>(3) Comprehending the GOP argument requires a certain amount of abstract thinking, as in cause &amp; effect scenarios and long-term consequences. Very few blacks seem capable of processing concepts that extend beyond the immediate here-and-now.</p>

		<p>Typical black leadership failing to represent their constituants.<br>
Typical indifferent, misguided or stupid blacks tolerating transparently awful leaders.<br>
Whites have the same problem to large degree, but there is no comparison in the degree of corruption that is tolerated.<br>
Whites will self police, blacks never have and never will.</p>

		<p>I have noticed for years now there are no blacks in restaurant kitchens or doing lawn care.  Or for that matter and private sector lower level labor.  Totally displaced on the East coast by Hispanics.</p>

		<p>Blacks are still singing that tired old tune about wanting something for nothing (a good job despite the fact that they have no education), and Latinos are wising up to the fact that they do need education to get decent jobs, so many are getting that education.  They look down on the uneducated blacks, just like everyone else does; if the blacks would get off their posteriors and get the education that is needed for these times, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any of this racial fighting over low paying jobs.  My belief is, your choices determine your position in life; people who have to work unskilled labor jobs do so because they chose not to go to school, chose to maybe have kids at 15 and go on welfare, chose to deal drugs and go to jail   &mdash;   and also become addict/alcoholics   &mdash;   hey, get with the program, people.  Choose wisely and it won&rsquo;t matter what Farrakhan, Jesse or Al - or any politician - says; you won&rsquo;t need them to keep trying to get you money without you having to work for it.</p>

Blacks support non-white immigration because they believe when non-whites surpass whites, non-whites will have the revolution they have long dreamed of (just like Haiti) and seize power and control.</p>
<p>Of course, Hispanics have their own agenda and it doesn&rsquo;t include blacks but blacks still haven&rsquo;t figured that out and likely never will.</p>
<p>Already, affirmative action jobs that were SUPPOSED to be going to descendents of slaves are going to other non-whites and blacks even SUPPORT this type of affirmative action.</p>

		<p>Almost like watching a train wreck, you want to look away, but you just can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m curious to see what it will be like the day that some Hispanic politician tells Al or Jesse to go jump in a lake and makes it stick. If you think the Hispanics will mistreat blacks, just wait until the Chinese get a hold of them. It will make Mississippi in the 1950&rsquo;s look like a paradise. </p>

		<p>There was an article in a San Francisco newespaper, it was rhe SF Weekly, that said that employers would rather hire hispanics over blacks because hispanics worked faster.This is, I believe because blacks just think and ponder about everything more than anyone else, and this must be genetic</p>

		<p>John Conyers?  Well, his wife is in prison right now for taking bribes and she got a court appointed attorney because she claimed not to have any money to pay for an attorney (totally true story, check it).</p>
<p>And Conyers&rsquo; son was arrested for wrecking Conyers&rsquo; state paid for vehicle.  I think it was a Cadillac Escalade.  </p>

		<p>It looks like white Republican congressmen care more about working class blacks than black Democratic congressmen do.  I&rsquo;m not surprised.</p>
