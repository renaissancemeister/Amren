<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The lawyer for Shanterrica Madden, the suspect in the murder of Middle Tennessee State University women&rsquo;s basketball player Clantina &#8220;Tina&#8221; Stewart, claimed that his client acted in self defense in the fatal stabbing, according to a report.</p>
<p>Joe Brandon told a reporter at Madden&rsquo;s Thursday morning arraignment that Madden was being beaten up by Stewart and had stabbed her with Stewart&rsquo;s own knife, according to the Daily News Journal.</p>
<p>Officials have said the two women got into a fight in their apartment when Madden pulled out a knife and stabbed Stewart.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Stewart was a junior at MTSU and is originally from Memphis. </p>
<p>Police received an anonymous 911 call from an off-campus apartment complex just before 7:00 p.m. Wednesday. When they arrived on scene they found Stewart stabbed several times, reports CBS affiliate WTVF. {snip}</p>

								<h2><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/news/story?id=6177164">MTSU Deciding Whether To Play Tourney</a></h2>
						<p>
							<i>ESPN, March 3, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>Middle Tennessee State officials are meeting with the Blue Raiders women&rsquo;s basketball team and will let the squad decide if they want to play in the upcoming Sun Belt Conference tournament after the stabbing death of their teammate.</p>
<p>Eighteen-year-old Shanterrica Madden has been charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing of junior guard Tina Stewart from Memphis. Police found the 21-year-old Stewart stabbed repeatedly inside her apartment. She was taken to Middle Tennessee Medical Center and was later pronounced dead.</p>
<p>{snip} The Middle Tennessee women are the No. 1 seed from the East and scheduled to play their first game Sunday in Hot Springs, Ark.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Attorney Joe Brandon told The Associated Press on Thursday that Madden used Stewart&rsquo;s own knife on her during a fight. He did not say what the altercation was about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Stewart, who was an athlete, had Miss Madden down on the ground beating on her. Miss Madden has an abrasion above her left eye, looks like perhaps a fingernail. She has swelling to both of her eyes. And during the course of the fight, a knife belonging to Miss Stewart that was in Miss Stewart&rsquo;s possession ended up getting used on Miss Stewart,&#8221; Brandon said.</p>
<p>An MTSU freshman, Madden is being held without bond on a charge of first-degree murder. Her attorney won a request that Madden be photographed by police to document her injuries as proof of the fight. Brandon said he will file a motion asking that bond be set for Madden. She is scheduled back in Rutherford County General Sessions Court on March 11.</p>
<p>Stewart averaged 5.5 points and 2.5 rebounds in 28 games this season for the Blue Raiders (23-6, 14-2). </p>

		<p>It very well could have been a case of self-defense. I think they should give her the benefit of the doubt and turn her loose. However, if she starts fatally stabbing several Black girls per week in self defense, then I think they need to get her some counseling to help her learn how to select associates who aren&rsquo;t as likely to pull a knife on her.</p>

		<p>A murder case involving &#8220;Clantina&#8221; and &#8220;Shanterrica&#8221;&hellip;that&rsquo;s hardly news. The only odd thing is that both appear to be 18 years of age yet neither has three illegitimate offspring.</p>
<p>The truly strange thing is that our conception of &#8220;higher education&#8221; has been so warped that most Americans take for granted that &#8220;students&#8221; are admitted to American universities sometimes on the basis of academic ability and other times because of race and ability to bounce a ball.</p>

		<p>I used to attend this school and have to say that this is fairly typical for MTSU. When I moved there, I was simply amazed to find a little slice of Memphis ghetto in small town middle Tennessee waiting for me. Aside from the typical: obnoxious loudness, petty theft, and ho&rsquo; fights, a major episode of black violence occurs at least once a semester (As a rule, the perps are ALWAYS from Memphis). <br>
My sophomore year, some woman named Starla slashed a white girl&rsquo;s face open over a parking space. When they interviewed the victim all she could sputter in disbelief. It didn&rsquo;t make sense to her that someone would cut her over a parking spot. For any one familiar with black behavior it made perfect sense. I knew what was up. In Starla&rsquo;s defense, parking is pretty bad during the day. </p>
<p>Last fall, a black freshman died in a high speed chase with police on 24E. He didn&rsquo;t even make it to check in or even to campus before his demise. I seem to recall some shootings at an apartment complexes as well. And that&rsquo;s just the stuff you hear about on the news. </p>
<p>The less than lethal run ins with blacks were pretty bizarre too. Take election night 2008 flash mob for example. It was a quiet night just like any other until about 10:30. Then there was a low buzzing off in the distance, a faint whisper of hip hop and ebonics in the wind. Then all at once, like fire ants, they came out of the shadows from every direction, shouting &#8220;paint the Whitehouse black&#8221;. In 15 minutes time their were more blacks than I had ever seen on campus at once, 10 times as many as during exam week, all gathering on one of the commons at the center of campus creating an impromptu block party. Rap music was coming out of nowhere and everybody &#8220;wuz gettin crunk.&#8221; Then, the police promptly surrounded the mob and dispersed them. Despite their usually unhurried strut, the Obama vote vanished into the night in mere minutes once encouraged by law enforcement. Extra squad cars patrolled all night around campus. <br>
Next time MTSU comes up on Amren, i&rsquo;ll tell you all about the &#8220;vertical jungle&#8221; or  the time Hurricane Rita visits Murfreesboro and stays for three weeks. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on the K bomb threat when the FBI came.   </p>

		<p>A knife ended up getting used.  Typical.  No human agency involved, no responsibility. Africans are a force of nature, and all you can do is avoid them as far as possible.</p>

<p>I have to respond to your post, which slanders Middle Tennessee in my opinion, and for no reason.</p>
<p>&#8220;a little slice of Memphis ghetto in small town middle Tennessee&#8221;</p>
<p>Murfreesboro, TN is not a &#8220;small town&#8221; by any means.  &#8220;The population was 101,753 according to the United States Census Bureau&rsquo;s 2009 report&#8221;  &mdash;  Wikipedia.  Most people know that a small town is 10,000 or fewer inhabitants.  Murfreesboro is 35 miles from the state capital, Nashville, not some isolated backwater.</p>
<p>Also, &#8220;The racial makeup of the city was 79.85% White, 13.89% African American, 0.28% Native American, 2.69% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 1.88% from other races, and 1.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.53% of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not by any stretch similar to Memphis, in any way.</p>
<p>Memphis is a blight on our state; don&rsquo;t bring the rest of the state down by association.  Memphis is over 200 miles west from Middle Tennessee.</p>
<p>I never attended MTSU, but I commuted there from Nashville daily in the summer of 1973 as a young teen with my mother who was taking graduate courses.  I hung out in the library, cafeteria, etc. while she was in class.  Beautiful clean studious campus.  I never noticed one black, ever, at that time.  If they were there they sure kept quiet.  I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s different now but I seriously doubt that it has become some despoiled haven for ghetto blacks!<br>

		<p>Cousin Charlie,</p>
<p>Are you really sincere? First of all, I&rsquo;m talking about the school not the city. Mufreesboro is everything you say it is. Secondly, its FOURTY years later? A lot changes in four decades, especially now that everybody and his brother goes to college. MTSU in fact, has grown so much in the last few years that it now has more undergraduates than any university in Tennessee. I LIVED on campus for two years and was there just last fall so I can speak about it. While the city of Mufreesboro isn&rsquo;t a haven for ghetto blacks from Memphis, the school is. They don&rsquo;t make up a huge chunk of the student body (especially in summer term), but there are many blacks and most of them are from Memphis. So when I say there is a little slice of the Memphis ghetto there, I&rsquo;m lot lying. And they&rsquo;re loud as hell now. Why else would I overhear, on my first day at school no less, a Memphis black talking about the new ipod he just stole?</p>

		<p>Anything is possible, but some thing are more possible than others. In my adult life I have had considerable contact with female varsity athletes on the prep level and also on the college level to some extent.</p>
<p>Among the female athletes there are very few of what you would call &#8220;rough&#8221; girls or troublemakers. Many of them are 4.0 students. The ones who are not outstanding students generally do not have academic problems.</p>
<p>ALthough fewer of the minority girls are high GPA students, they generally are the same as the white female athletes otherwise. </p>
<p>Compared the male athletes, the female athletes were very easy people to get along with.  </p>
<p>We do not know what happened. There may have been an argument and altercation. Based on what I know about female varsity athletes, I don&rsquo;t think Tina Stewart was the one who escalated the confrontation to the level of deadly force.</p>
<p>Evidently personal habits or perhaps something more serious was the issue. News reports in the Murfreeboro (TN) Post suggest Stewart objected to drug use in the apartment, which apparently was university housing. </p>
<p>Stewart&rsquo;s efforts to &#8220;work&#8221; with her troubled roommate proved fatal. When Stewart sought assistance from the staff, the altercation ensued.</p>
