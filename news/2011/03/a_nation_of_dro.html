<p>Portugal is the poorest country in Western Europe. It is also the least educated, and that has emerged as a painful liability in its gathering economic crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Without the budget cuts, Portugal is almost certain to need an international bailout. It will run out of money this year without fresh cash, and markets are charging punitive rates for borrowing. Two firms downgraded Portugal&rsquo;s credit rating Thursday.</p>
<p>Its dire situation thrust a possible Portuguese rescue onto the agenda of European Union leaders who gathered in Brussels Thursday for a previously scheduled meeting, where they were agreeing on a new bailout fund. Portugal would be the third country in the euro zone to require a bailout, after Greece and Ireland.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cheap rote labor that once sustained Portugal&rsquo;s textile industry has vanished to Asia. The former Eastern Bloc countries that joined the European Union en masse in 2004 offer lower wages and workers with more schooling. They have sucked skilled jobs away. </p>
<p>Just 28% of the Portuguese population between 25 and 64 has completed high school. The figure is 85% in Germany, 91% in the Czech Republic and 89% in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t see how it is going to grow without educating its work force,&#8221; says Pedro Carneiro, an economist at University College London who left Portugal to do his postgraduate studies in the U.S. </p>
<p>The education woes in Portugal show the extent of Europe&rsquo;s challenge as it tries to right itself amid the sovereign-debt crisis. </p>
<p><b>Educating Portugal</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Portugal&rsquo;s crisis, by contrast, has come to a boil slowly. For a decade, Portugal&rsquo;s growth trailed the euro-zone average. Traditional industries like cork harvesting and shoe stitching couldn&rsquo;t energize the entire country. The tech boom of the mid-2000s largely passed Portugal by.</p>
<p>The Portuguese spent nonetheless. The economy  &mdash;  government and private sector together  &mdash;  has run cumulative deficits with the rest of the world of more than €130 billion over the past decade. The state hasn&rsquo;t had a balanced budget, let alone a surplus, for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Portugal has just begun phasing in 12 years of required schooling; now, Portuguese can leave school after ninth grade. Many do. The government says it is racing ahead with reforms. Mr. Sócrates points to an initiative that gives students laptops and to a far-reaching project to rebuild dilapidated schoolhouses. Results last year show students improving on standardized tests.</p>
<p>But it is a long road. &#8220;We have accumulated years and years of ignorant people,&#8221; says Belmiro de Azevedo, a billionaire industrialist.</p>
<p>He described the system as calcified. The central administration wields tight control. Curricula are simultaneously undemanding and rigid. Dropout rates are high. Schools struggle to accommodate an influx of immigrants from Portugal&rsquo;s former colonies in Africa, such as Angola and Guinea-Bissau.</p>

		<p>I have noticed here what apears to be some sort of an anomaly.  According to this article, Portugal is the poorest country in Western Europe. It even lags behind some of the Eastern European Nations as far as literacy rates, higher education, and unemployment rate. Yet, Portugal is one of the safest and most crime-free countries on the planet.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4mn75p6" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/4mn75p6</a></p>
<p>Now correct me if I am wrong, but isn&rsquo;t crime supposed to be the result of poverty? I&rsquo;m confused&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Someone please correct me, but wasn&rsquo;t there massive importation of Black Africans into Portugal between 1650 and 1850, such that now the Portuguese have a very high percentage of African genes?</p>
<p>Before that time, Portugal was 99% White, and was one of the most powerful nations in the world. </p>

		<p>When I travelled through Portugal 15 years ago, I found it heavily dependant on seasonal tourism. </p>
<p>In the off-season, it appeared the towns boarded up their businesses, and productive work was not in evidence.   </p>
<p>My anecdotal conclusion was that the people are not unlike Mexicans, who wait for the northerners to bring the tourist wealth.  </p>

<p>Mr. Sousa,<br/>
Recall that West Virginia also is poor and ranks among the safest states in the US. The difference seems to be that both Portugal and West Virginia are [i]white[/i] and poor. </p>
<p>In the US, those of sub-Saharan African descent (often poor) also possess higher levels of blood serum testosterone - low IQ, high testosterone = increased levels of violence.</p>

		<p>   Beginning in the 1500s, when Portugal began importing West African slaves to Brazil, they also began breeding with them. Apparently there were no social rules against it. <br/>
   I&rsquo;ve been there, and the results can be seen today: a small, dark skinned people with very curly hair (though not all of them), whose country is &#8220;the sick man of Europe&#8221;. <br/>
   Though I must say, here in the Boston area we have quite a number of them, and they are not a problem. A social worker once confessed to me he preferred them (and Cubans) over Puerto Ricans.<br/>

		<p>Miscegenation in Portugal? Until recently (30 years), everbody was white,Portuguese and Catholic (except some gypsies). Miscegenation was the official &#8220;excuse&#8221; to keep the colonies in Africa. Portugal was poor, closed to the world, and in many ways, still is. But it still 95% white, also.</p>

		<p>Portugal had a large sub-Saharan slave population and absorbed them into their gene pool. It&rsquo;s not surprising that they have a lower IQ and a more lackadaisical approach to work. Portugal should be a forewarning to any White nation with even a small percentage of Blacks. Portugal is the result of miscegenation, though the overall percentage of sub-Saharan genes is not that high (less than 10 percent nationwide). Blacks are simply so far removed from Whites that they&rsquo;ll drag down the entire White population, whether through mixing or by their very presence. </p>

		<p>White countries are slowly being subjected to campaigns of destruction by the genocidists. </p>
<p>Destroying the education of whites is one of the methods used by the genocidists, as is massive non-white immigration.</p>
<p>Ireland was mentioned as a country that &#8220;needed&#8221; a bailout.  Not too long ago Ireland was doing very well.  </p>
<p>That ended when the genocidists forced massive non-white immigration into Ireland.  These non-white immigrants destroyed the Irish economy. </p>
<p>Genocidism is the number one problem facing whites.  Anyone who supports anti-white genocide must be removed from power.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s much lower because they brought home a lot of Latinos from their colonial adventures. Spain took home a similar amount, but Spain&rsquo;s a much larger country so the mixing had a very small effect. The Portuguese once were fair central Europeans, hence their strength. They are in many ways a warning of what happens with mass immigration. Once you put the people in, getting out is near-impossible in short of something extremely drastic(and likely very bloody), hence it&rsquo;s almost impossible to stop the destruction of your people.</p>

		<p>Portugal imported Africans hundreds of years earlier than most of Europe. But also, people in Southern Portugal have a lot of Moorish (North African) and Gypsy ancestry, Southern Portugal was controlled by Moorish invaders for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>On the south coast, most of the locals are quite dark, like North Africans. They&rsquo;re very open and friendly people. The tourists from the north are much lighter skinned like people from Northern Spain. There&rsquo;s a lot of Celtic and Germanic ancestry there. There are crime problems in the big cities but as is often the case, this is largely due to African immigrants.</p>

		<p>Another point, but Germans and other financially prudent northern Europeans are only just beginning to realise what an appallingly lunatic system the Euro currency is.</p>
<p>    Basically, the Euro is purely a political project imposed by the undemocratic, unaccountable European elite in order to force political union by using economics as a lever - except it&rsquo;s flawed, it cannot possibly work.You simply cannot meld an economy like Germany&rsquo;s with Portugal&rsquo;s unless Germany permanently and massively subsidies Portugal.</p>
<p>  Twenty or so years ago many right-wing British politicians (lead by Enoch Powell), fought a lonely, desperate rearguard action against Britain being steamrollered into the Euro by its then Tory political class.By sheer persistence they managed to win the argument and stop British entry in the face of enormous opposition from big business and the political class.  I learned a lot from the during those heated debates - Euro entry means the end of national sovereignty, no ../../../../__8216.css;ifs&rsquo; or ../../../../__8216.css;buts&rsquo; about it.</p>

		<p>On checking Wikipedia for Portugal demographics, I found that the country has had a large influx of people from Slavic countries, which might lower the national average by a few  &mdash;  but only a few  &mdash;  points.  Much more significantly, the article indicates that African immigrants, mainly illegals, have been arriving in numbers that have not been formally counted.  </p>
<p>It seems to me that crime rates do not always soar with the first generation of low-IQ immigrants, who sometimes don&rsquo;t have a good sense of how to game the system and thus must actually work.  The trouble comes with their children.  <br/>
I don&rsquo;t know much about European schooling in general, but I have to wonder if there are many private schools there that might not get tallied in a government study of dropout rates.  (Poor children might get reduced or free admission in schools run by the Catholic Church, for instance.)  In the U.S. these schools WOULD be counted, so I assume they would be in Europe.  There also appears to be some cultural tendency for Portuguese teens to drop out before graduation and start work.  Of course, if this is what they do, they&rsquo;ll be less likely to be involved in crime.</p>

		<p>Portugal is suffering from the same problem that all the countries with advanced welfare states have. Portugal Italy and Greece dont have mature investment banking sectors. Instead they have high taxes and too many cushy public sector non jobs and generous benefits. </p>
<p>Portugal also has very stringent labour laws. Much like in France, where you cant fire anyone without being torn a new one at an industrial tribunal. </p>
<p>I wouldnt be surprised if Portugal has a bombed out housing sector ala Spain from villas stuck in negative equity built on credit designed to be sold to Brits, Germans and Scandis. </p>
<p>If i had a business where i could work remotely, Portugal would be a great place to go. Inexpensive lifestyle, guaranteed sunshine and a couple of hours flight or less from London Paris Berlin etc. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve known many Portuguese people. They&rsquo;re less honest than Slavs and rarely do you meet a character who stands out. The&rsquo;re almost all the same. But they aren&rsquo;t violent, don&rsquo;t steal, they work hard and their 2nd generation is very assimilated compared to Slavs plus they are unambitious so you don&rsquo;t worry about them taking over your country. A perfect immigrant underclass. Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong but African genes are at under 2%. </p>

		<p>To Kenelm Digby (re post # 13):</p>
<p>Entrance in the EU also meant that member states had to abolish the death penalty, in those countries where it was still on the books. So, a terrorist from the Middle East can blow up hundreds of people and sit in jail for life, if he commits a crime in an EU country.</p>
<p>Interesting how the EU likes to preach diversity and multiculturalism, but makes its member states adopt a single currency, the euro.</p>
<p>I miss the German mark, the French, Begian and Swiss franc, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Greek drachma, the Irish punt, and the Dutch guilder. Also, the Scandinavian members had the krone, and krona (don&rsquo;t remember who had what, exactly). </p>

		<p>Portugal is what you get, when low IQ people, rallying around an ideology, eliminate their betters.  It has happened elsewhere.  But the Inquisition was particularly cruel and long-running in Portugal.</p>
<p>Not only were overt Jews eliminated, but anyone whose ancestry included Jews was eventually driven from the country (virtually the entire elite), or tortured to death in ways that are scarcely imaginable.  And I doubt that Jews were the only group of intelligent ../../../../__8216.css;Infidels&rsquo; removed from Portuguese society.  Jews are just better at surviving, and better at publicizing their persecutions.</p>
<p>The effect of a moronic and oppressive belief system, imposed for centuries, upon threat of death (horrible death, at that) would have eventually removed those who were bright, independent, honest, and prone to Critical Thinking (True Whites, including, but certainly not limited to, Jews).  Such an oppressive system would, instead, have favored the stupid and insensitive; the Dull Plodders; those who reproduce without thinking (the Marginally White).</p>
<p>The population of the Middle East was far whiter and brighter than it is now.  But wave after wave of ../../../../__8216.css;all or nothing&rsquo; ideology has swept across that region.  Look what lives there NOW.</p>
<p>The Dysgenic effect of Ideology has been degrading the Human Genome for some time.  I see little difference between Religions in the Mosaic Watershed, and Communism, in their effect of eliminating the best and brightest.</p>
<p>NOW, low-IQ people are rallying around the Ideology of&hellip;what does one call it&hellip;OneWorlderism?  Egalitarianism?  KillWhiteyism?  The results will have been predictable.</p>

<p>That was the detail I was hinting at, I was using sarcasm when referring this as an ../../../../__8216.css;anomaly&rsquo; lol. The whole Crime is a result of poverty theory is just another excuse from Dems/Liberals to defend why blacks are responsible for so much crime and savage behaviour.  The dropout rate in Portugal is comparable to the dropout rate of African-Americans in the USA, yet the Portuguese aren&rsquo;t going around shooting each other up, robbing senior citizens and/or gang-raping little girls. In fact whatever crime there is in Portugal is almost exclusively attributed to the immigrants from the former colonies (mostly Angolans and black Brazilians) as well as Roma Gypsies. As Rechill mentioned, there are now &#8220;no-go&#8221; zones in the outskirts of Lisbon where shootouts between Roma and Africans are very common. It&rsquo;s really a shame.  </p>
<p>As for the reasons behind the current situation regarding economic infrastructure, education, layed-back attitude, here is my take. Going back a few hundred years as some here have mentioned, Portugal was the first European nation to adopt to miscegenation. The very ../../../../__8216.css;liberal&rsquo; population accepted and allowed Africans to live amongst them where they interbred and intermarried. That resulted in the ../../../../__8216.css;dumbing down&rsquo; of the Portuguese populace and the beginning of an ../../../../__8216.css;idiocracy&rsquo;. They went from being among the most ambitious and intelligent people in Europe to one of the most layed back and ../../../../__8216.css;dumbest&rsquo;. They eventually became highly dependant on the Colonies as their main source of revenue and did not bother progressing at the pace of the rest of Europe. When colonialism was forced to end in the 1960&rsquo;s, Portugal slipped into a slumber as they had limmited resources (cork, Port-wine and exporting soccer players cannot sustain a nations economy). And the fact that they were under a dictatorship until the 1970&rsquo;s did not help them either as much of the skilled/educated workforce fled to North America. Being in the EU is probably not helping much, since it has caused an influx of useless refugees leaching off the already limited resources and bringing in even cheaper labour than what the Portuguese are willing to work for. Portugal is well behind the rest of Western Europe no doubt,but they are making progress. The progress would happen much quicker though, if not for the Africans and Roma keeping them down. I myself am of Portuguese decent, so I really hope they pull through.  If anything, hopefully our leaders in Canada, the USA and the rest of the west are taking note. </p>

<p>I was wondering the same thing about the private institutions.  The high school dropout rate is incredibly high but if large numbers of students are being graduated from private institutions then there is something seriously wrong with their government educational system.  I&rsquo;ve always found Europeans in general to be more educated than Americans.  A friend of mine is from Scotland and she says that an associate&rsquo;s degree in America is the equivalent of 12 years of public schooling in Europe.  Also, as far as miscegenation is concerned, I&rsquo;ve heard that the imported black population of Portugal never exceeded more than 3-4 percent.  I&rsquo;ve been to Lisbon and I didn&rsquo;t notice any difference between Portuguese or any other Mediterranean peoples of Southern Europe.  I did however meet a a Portuguese woman who was working the front desk of a hotel I stayed in in South Carolina.  She was very dark and swarthy looking which makes me doubt her ancestry.  She could have been one of the &#8220;new Europeans&#8221; imported into Portugal who then made her way into the US.</p>

		<p>There was some racial mixing with African slaves who were brought to work somewhere around the 1500-1700&rsquo;s.  This have been proven beyond a doubt by recent DNA studies.  The African ancestry is all on the maternal line and concentrated in rural agricultural areas.  You can see today that some Portuguese people are clearly mixed.  The was also mixing with black slaves in France and England, but not enough to be noticeable today.  </p>

		<p>Nationwide the background of African genes in Portugal is 2%.  It is, however, 7% in the south  &mdash;  the highest in all of Europe.</p>
<p>But the &#8220;short, dark, curly-haired&#8221; Portuguese that one poster brought up is NOT the result of miscegenation  &mdash;  rather, those are a particular type of Mediterranean that was once spread heavily along the Atlantic coast of Europe.  You can find similar folk in Ireland and Wales; the great Ulster folk-hero Cuchulainn supposedly looked like this.</p>

<p>I suspect most of the people here who said they&rsquo;ve been to Portugal just saw what they wanted to see. I was surprised at the amount of blue and green eyes I saw in the people there (not that brown eyes can&rsquo;t be White), and had my opinions on what the Portuguese people were inverted. They are just as &#8220;White&#8221; as any other Europeans. </p>
<p>Plus, the amount of non-European genes in the Portuguese people is very minimal and is comparable to other Mediterranean countries. </p>
<p>If all these wannabe nordicists want to attract more Whites to their movement, maybe they should stop denigrating Mediterranean Whites. </p>

I realize that not all  of a country&rsquo;s problems be summed up in one neat answer. Nonetheless, I believe there is a racial component in Portugal&rsquo;s problem  that could not be discussed in &#8220;legitimate&#8221; media outside of sites like Amren.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time in Portugal, some years ago. Spain as well. It was interesting to see the differences between the two. I had expected them to be very similar.  They were not!  I traveled all about and studied their history thoroughly. I had a particular interest in the era of the Reconquest.</p>
<p>As Highduke said above (of the Portuguese), &#8220;rarely do you meet a character who stands out. <b>The&rsquo;re almost all the same. </b>But they aren&rsquo;t violent, don&rsquo;t steal&hellip;&#8221;  Yes, I too was struck  by the uniformity of the Portuguese; they all look related, like members of one large family. Spain, by contrast, has a variety of ethnic types, quite distinct from one another. The Portuguese are shorter and darker than Spaniards, and less good looking. Immediately on crossing  the Spanish border one encounters blonds, but I don&rsquo;t  recall ever seeing a blond in Portugal (except foreigners). I&rsquo;m sure there must be some; but it would be rare   &mdash;   perhaps in the very north.</p>
<p>As for crime, yes, the Portuguese are/were peaceful and seemed gentle. But (at least back then) the Portuguese police are/were anything but gentle, had zero tolerance for misbehavior, and they were respected!   &mdash;   unlike in liberal western societies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to realize that Portugal was united (recovered/reconquered from the Moors) several centuries before Spain. It did not have expulsions, as did Spain. The re-conquered, Arabized  population was left in place and re-Christianized.  In Spain, however, depending on the century and the current monarch&rsquo;s policy, whole regions  were cleared and re-populated with fresh stock from the North. Hence, you find  blonds even in the extreme South of Spain. Not so in Portugal. </p>
<p>Portugal, in its great age of exploration, was the first to explore down the coast of Africa, the first to reach India. Then China and Japan.  This made it a great world power and for a time the wealthiest country in Europe. Lisbon displaced Venice as the center of the spice trade. Lisbon was full of luxury and the merchants of Lisbon began importing African slaves in the 1400&rsquo;s, long before any other European country (&#8220;to do work the Portugues no longer wanted to do&#8221;). I cannot say about the 2 centuries of &#8220;massive importation of Black Africans into Portugal between 1650 and 1850&#8221;, mentioned by #4. I&rsquo;m not aware of that; it&rsquo;s possible, but Portugal&rsquo;s importation of blacks had already begun much earlier.  Doug summed the general situation up very well in his post (#12).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that Portugal&rsquo;s &#8220;Great Age&#8221; occurred during the famed English alliance (against Castille) when the royal family was half English, and English presence was heavy everywhere in commerce and the military. The (English) mother of Prince Henry the Navigator was Queen Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.  She was a woman who encouraged promotion of sciences and the arts (an interest quite novel in Iberian queens until then). The Portuguese court was teeming with English advisors and experts (without whose protection the country would have been absorbed  into Spain).</p>
<p>Official Portuguese policy, at least  in the colonies, was to encourage miscegenation, producing loyal Portuguese subjects. I don&rsquo;t think this applied at home, but I don&rsquo;t think there was much thought given to it either. The Portuguese were never especially race conscious. Being the first to encounter other races, they were racially naive. Inevitably, there was  backwash from the colonies   &mdash;   the most recent wave being from the former colonies in Africa.  And  there was always seepage from its huge daughter, Brazil.   Portugal was never so race-conscious as Spain   &mdash;   with the latter&rsquo;s emphasis on resurrecting its Visigothic past and maintaining &#8220;purity of blood&#8221; (<i>pureza de sangre</i>), a foreign idea to the Portuguese. You can see the difference in the populations today. (Rapidly closing though, with Spain&rsquo;s massive importation of North Africans.)</p>
<p>J.Paul, #7, mentions the Portuguese in the Boston area. I&rsquo;m not sure about them (probably from the Azores) but there are various &#8220;Portuguese&#8221; from different parts parts of the world, owing to Portugal&rsquo;s far-flung empire. Goan Portuguese from India. Cape Verdeans (populated from Africa). The Azores, discovered by Portugal in the 1400s, were populated by Flemish settlers - tall, fair, well made people   &mdash;   sent  from Flanders (ie Dutch)   &mdash;   the result of another royal marriage, one of Queen Philippa&rsquo;s progeny.  Portugal at that time, its Golden Age, had very strong cultural/political/royal connections with France, Burgundy, Flanders, and especially England.</p>

		<p>American writer, director, and race realist, Myron Fagan wrote the truth about the Portuguese in his pamphlet entitled  <i>How Greatest White Nations were Mongrelized then Negroized.</i></p>
<p>In it, Mr. Fagan explained that Portugal, once, in a short period of time, had more African slaves than whites.</p>
<p>However, the Portuguese royal family considered the presence of Africans a future burden and in a single drop of a sceptre, expelled all the slaves from the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Fagan stated that due to the mass expulsion of slaves at one time, Portugal remains a member of the white family. </p>
<p>According to author Lewis Mumphord, (Time and Tecnics), technology, economics, society, culture, and the natural elasticity time, play a critical part in the history of a nation and its ability to gain ground after a country has reached its culmination.</p>
<p>It seems that somewhere in Portugal&rsquo;s ancient past, the peoples capacity was sabotaged and blunted.</p>
<p>War and subversion by an ideological enemy of which the Moors did not play the most critical role may be the answer.<br/>

<p>I hope the Portuguese stay strong and maintain their country amidst this engineered crisis. Looking at it in a metaphysical matter it&rsquo;s perhaps the price they have to pay for being the nation that started Western global dominance which the entire world benefits from. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a coincidence that Northern European countries aside from Ireland are spared from all of this. I laugh at the Anglo-Germanic newscasters when they gleefully address the economically-challenged countries as &#8220;PIGS&#8221; on national tv. Talk about professional diplomacy.

		<p>As for miscegenation from what I know it occurred mostly in the colonies similar to Spain but not as common in the mother country. The reason why the Portuguese have a generally Mediterranean-looking population is because obviously Portugal is a Mediterranean nation, and the country was under the Moors for hundreds of years. The Portuguese would have been &#8220;dark&#8221; long before the Moors for being situated in the south of Europe alone.</p>
<p>ghw: The reason why Portugal started the Age of Discovery was because the country was situated by the sea and the enterprising nature of Henry the Navigator assured the event would take place. Henry having English genes would have to be more of a coincidence in it&rsquo;s role in the first global empire. Saying Britain played a big role in Portugal&rsquo;s ascent is like stating the British created the world&rsquo;s largest empire then because of their close genetic link to Iberia and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Face it, the Latins started it all . </p>

<p>Exactly the same was the case with the Ottomans in Turkey. There were many African slaves brought in, but no descendents remain.  Children of  (black) female slaves were smothered at birth. One fair white slave was  worth many times a black slave. The Turks didn&rsquo;t want any mulattoes, and there are none to be seen  there today.

<p>I am sure that Albania remains the poorest &#8220;in Europe&#8221;, and the most backward of all.  But Portugal is the poorest in WESTERN Europe.  </p>
<p>But  Albania was never a rich country, nor  a great world power   &mdash;   which Portugal once was. For Portugal the past lingers on as a sad reminder, like the sad &#8220;fado&#8221; songs.  Portugal largely lives in memories of its  past when it was, briefly, the foremost country in Europe. Indeed, the world.  Albania has no such grand past.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Portugal hasn&rsquo;t had a balanced budget in thirty years.&#8221; The old dictator Antonio Salazar died in 1968. His regime known as the Estado Novo survived until 1974 when it was over-thrown by the Carnation Revolution. It is amazing that Portugal stood alone in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique against Cuba and the Soviet Union for as long as it did. Rhodesia and South Africa were next. Some Portuguese probably wish they had those colonies and jobs, instead of having to ../../../../__8216.css;go back to school&rsquo; and having their country flooded by refugees from those countries. They might want to start saving up for a boat trip across the Atlantic to Brazil or the United States(if Portugal becomes that miserable), because I don&rsquo;t think Germany and England are going to open up their wallets for them. </p>

		<p>So the conclusion is that Portugal is poor because it has a people of mixed race meaning not of pure white race. The corollary being that if a country is 100% white - which many readers seem to equate with Nordics - it cannot be poor. But this is a reductio ad absurdum as a sizeable number of countries [of the former Iron Curtain ergo Nordics or so] are poorer than Portugal measuring by percapita income. One has to recognize the complexity of the issue of race as this tiny country whose blood was mixed from the beginning with Celtic, Romans, Goth and Moorish infusions at one time shared with Spain (another mixed race people) the rule of Europe. As for the supposedly super intelligent Nordics: what were their higher achievements prior to the Modern Age? In antiquity they dwelled in huts, had no written language and no noticeable advancements in technology, science or philosophy. When by their sheer number and Roman incompetence they conquered the Western Empire they plunged Europe in the Dark Age. Another irony for the race purists: by that time the darker Moors preserved most of the culture of Antiquity and its civilization surpassed Europe in almost all accounts. Sorry fellows things are not that simple as some of you think.</p>

		<p>I spent a little time in Portugal in the mid-80&rsquo;s.  It was really a pleasant place, especially if one is of a conservative bent.  The people were friendly, and I did not see any crime.  No pornography or prostitution was apparent, and I didn&rsquo;t see any crime or public intoxication.  What was interesting was that in a certain park in Lisbon (Praca Marques de Pombal?)  teenagers would sit on the benches lip-locked, but not groping each other.  I am not a romantic, but thought it was kind of nice.</p>
<p>At that time, the economy was well behind Germany.  I bought one of those little coffee pots they make &#8220;bica&#8221; in, and it took me about twenty minutes.  The procedure was to select the pot from display, then a clerk went back to the stockroom, then it was brought up to the cashier.  I think the country just went from one economically inefficient system to the current one without having a crack at relatively free markets.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what it is like now, but back then I did not see any evidence of a lot of mixed-race people.  Of course if dark hair or short stature make one non-European, then a lot of people are out of consideration.  At least back then, it was a pleasant, laid-back, archaic (in a good sense) place.  The people were almost all very nice.</p>

		<p>On another note, the statistic regarding German graduation rates is false, if one considers &#8220;high school&#8221;  to be twelve years of education.  In Germany, those who are being educated for trades typically graduate from Hauptschule before they start their apprenticeships.  I believe the last grade in Hauptschule is eighth grade.  Those who are going on to University attend Gymnasium which is twelve grades plus an additional year working towards the &#8220;Abitur&#8221;, to get into University.  A middle course is Realschule.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t think high-school drop-out rates are a particularly instructive way of understanding a countries academic or intellectual standing. I know in my country, Britain, exams taken at 16 are now unbelievably easy, so there may well be many people staying on and getting worthless and meaningless qualifications, whereas in Portugal the third that actually make it through high school may actually be well educated. Better to have a third well educated and two thirds poorly educated (but at least with no illusions) than everyone badly educated to the same low standard.</p>

		<p>47 Anon: Why do people give so much credit to the Moors for preserving the culture of antiquity?  The Eastern Roman Empire, known to us as the Byzantine Empire, outlasted the fall of Rome by a thousand years, falling to the Turks only in 1453.  They needed no translations of Aristotle or Sophocles, being Greek-speakers.  They had never lost the culture of antiquity.  Gratitude towards the Moslems for saving our culture for us is just one more aspect of the multi-cult. </p>

		<p>To Anon at #47 and others: If people want to limit what is acceptably &#8220;white&#8221; or  &#8220;European,&#8221; be my guest.  But even recent history shows us that the supposedly superior Germans plunged all of Europe (and the U.S.) into two horrifically fratricidal wars from which the European peoples and Western Civilization have never recovered.  (I have nothing against Germans, have some German blood in me, my kids even more so.)  Let&rsquo;s be frank about our own history.  We can support and be proud of our own people(s), our own culture(s), and accept the diversity within, acknowledging that we are closer to the Portuguese than we are both by blood and ethos, to the Bantu, the red Indian, the Asian.<br/>
Everything that the northern Europeans (and only some of them) developed in the last few centuries had the foundations laid by the Greeks, Italians, Portuguese, Romans etc. </p>

		<p>Best should be to let a nationalist representative of the Portuguese speak for Portugal. One needs inside information, not just outside information. </p>

Although you are right that classical leanings was seriously preserved in the Byzantine Empire the main point for me is the [apparent] paradox of the highly intelligent Germanic tribes ravaging Europe and giving a damn to the stock of western culture whilst the lessen intelligent darker Moors preserving and expanding it which I think is a well established fact. Which highlights the complexity of the issue of race as I stated.</p>
<p>To AmericaFirst # 54:<br/>
I agree with you but this kind of infighting clearly weaken us. Smearing tiny Portugal is easy but we have bigger players in this vey same pocket like Spain, Greece, Italy and even some parts of France. </p>
<p>I thank you both for your replies. <br/>
