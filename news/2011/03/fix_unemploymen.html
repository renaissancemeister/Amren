<h1>Fix Unemployment by Changing the Constitution</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., House of Representatives, March 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mr. Speaker, I believe that the answer to long-term unemployment is actually in the Constitution of the United States. Well, let me say that a little differently.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not in the Constitution of the United States. It should be in the Constitution of the United States, and one of these days we&rsquo;re going to get there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>He [Franklin Roosevelt; Jackson is drawing on a speech from January 11, 1944] says we need to add to the Constitution the right to a family to have a decent home. What would that do for home construction in this nation? What would that do for millions of unemployed people?</p>
<p>He says we need to add to the Constitution the right to medical care. How many doctors would such a right create?</p>
<p>He says we need to add to the Constitution of the United States the right to a decent education for every American. How many schools would such a right build from Maine to California? How many people would be put to work building roofs and designing classrooms and providing every student with an iPod and a laptop?</p>
<p>How many ghettoes and barrios will actually be touched by such an amendment? In fact, very little that we pass in the Congress of the United States even touches the long-term unemployed. Only thing that touches them that this Congress has access to that can actually change their station in life is the Constitution of the United States.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, there&rsquo;s an even greater America that&rsquo;s in front of us. It&rsquo;s the America that adds to our founding document these basic rights.</p>

<p>Every state&rsquo;s Constitution has such a clause, and the Federal government spends money as if the Federal Constitution had such a clause (which it does not).  Yet, the kook left doesn&rsquo;t seem to be that happy.</p>
<p>Provide every student with an iPod and laptop?  Someone should audit Jesse Jackson Jr&rsquo;s campaign finance documents, to see if there&rsquo;s Apple or Steve Jobs on the other end.  And as far as laptops, that only means the ghetto students can watch porn and organize anti-white race riots on Twitter.</p>

		<p>When some men were forced north out of Africa 30,000 years ago, they encountered seasonal cold weather. Those who figured out how to build shelters went on to survive the winters. Then came the tests of agriculture, metals, gunpowder, and industrialization. All of these evolutionary challenges involved the cycle, which was broken down into units, and implanted Mathematics in our minds.</p>
<p>The science of Mathematics seems to be beyond the capacity of Representative Jesse Jackson, Jr.<br>

The people who inhabit ghettos and barrios are the people who create their own ghettos and barrios.</p>
<p>Blacks have no concept of how wealth is generated or how economies work. To them, money is something that is a resource that rich white people horde. If they take that money from the rich white people and distribute it equally to everyone, everyone will be equally well off. So their theory goes.</p>
<p>Even if you could redistribute wealth equally, six months later, the former poor would be worse off because they would not only carelessly squander their share but likely go into debt along the way buying cars and homes they couldn&rsquo;t afford to maintain.</p>

		<p>The man obviously doesn&rsquo;t understand federalism. Education and school-building are state concerns, not federal, and no state denies free education to its residents from ages 6 to 16.  Furthermore, education is a privilege, not a right because it requires constructive action on part of both the educating system and the ones being educated to make it effective. </p>
<p>Therefore, if Jamal is still in school just to steal cell phones and sell drugs, it certainly isn&rsquo;t his right, despite the fact that he may be in a classroom every now and again. (But you won&rsquo;t be able to tell his mama that because that would be violating her baby&rsquo;s &#8220;rights.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Incidentally, I have never seen a young black from any station in life without an iPod, so why should taxpayers buy them one for &#8220;school use?&#8221; Gimma, gimma, gimma.  </p>

		<p><i> and providing every student with an iPod and a laptop</i> </p>
<p>When I saw this quote from this &#8220;speech&#8221; on another site, I thought it HAD to be a joke  &mdash;  no one could be that stupid! As much as I love my iPod, I see it as the luxury that it is. For this man to think that this is an essential of life show just how primitive his thinking processes are.</p>
<p>I see this kind of madness in black thinking time and time again. In spite of the obvious infusion of white genetic material in this mans bloodline, as evidenced by his relatively light skin, it is obvious that the primitive mentality of reasoning still controls his thinking. </p>
<p>This is why blacks can never run a civilized society. As long as they are recognizably black, with few exceptions, their thinking processes are so severely impaired as to make a sustainable democracy impossible.</p>
<p><i> we need to add to the Constitution the right to a family to have a decent home. What would that do for home construction in this nation?  </i> </p>
<p>Absolutely nothing. This is an example of the &#8220;broken window&#8221; fallacy. Even if a house were built for every black family in the nation, it would not result in a net increase in jobs, because the labor required to build those homes would simply be diverted from other areas, and blacks would eventually end up destroying those homes anyway. </p>
<p>In the Gary neighborhood of Glen Park, fairly new ranch style homes are being abandoned as blacks spread out into the suburb of Merrillville in order to escape the rampant, out-of-control black-on-black crime. Yet running away from problems never solves them. If anything, it only makes them worse.</p>
<p>And by the way, was this man speaking to an empty house?</p>

		<p>Jackson Jr. may not know it, but nowhere in the U.S. Constitution is the word &#8220;education&#8221; mentioned. Nowhere is the term &#8220;affordable housing&#8221; mentioned. The U.S. Constitution was enacted to guarantee that every person had rights, and also spelled out that federal government and states had certain powers. It also lists what Uncle Sam and the states cannot do.</p>
<p>The U.S. Constitution says very little about economics, save the power of taxation, printing money, regulating commerce and maintaining a treasury. Jackson wants constitutional amendments that are nothing more than a rehash of Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s Great Society bromides. Jackson wants the federal government to control EVERY facet of the national economy. Many posters have already said, that dog don&rsquo;t hunt.</p>
<p>Bantus have more faith in the federal government, than a saint has in Christ. Uncle Sam is their &#8220;massa&#8221;.</p>
<p>NO WONDER then, that Bantus  still have that &#8220;slave mentality&#8221;, some 150 years after the &#8220;Emancipation&#8221;. They&rsquo;ve NEVER left the plantation.  </p>

		<p>The time is long overdue to return to a white majority of 85% in this country.  In order to do so must deport blacks/hispanics and close the borders to third world peoples to get this country back on track.  These blacks will never stop demanding for hand outs until the whites keep saying no, no, no.  But these politicians keep using tax money to buy votes from blacks and hispanics.  Blacks like Jackson have no concept of abstract subjects such as money, debt, economics, work, savings, etc.  </p>

		<p>A right to medical care written into the Constitution? I don&rsquo;t see how that would create doctors. I do see how that could enslave doctors. Say you&rsquo;re a doctor who wants to practice in Palo Alto, CA. The government, citing the Constitution, says that there are enough doctors in Palo Alto, but doctors are needed in south-central Los Angeles, so you have to work there. You say that you don&rsquo;t want to work in L.A. Government says that&rsquo;s too bad. The people in L.A. have a right to health care. You have to go where we tell you to go, and if you don&rsquo;t we will prosecute you.</p>
<p>To me that sounds like a recipe for fewer doctors, not more. </p>

		<p>Another left wing case living in a fantasy world. Rights are basic innate things: like free speech, being able to freely practice any religion you want, the right to defend yourself, your home and family, and the right to complain about anything and anybody. All the other &#8220;rights&#8221; this dreamer mentions cost money. Somebody has to pay for medical care, food for the hungry, education, housing. To say it&rsquo;s a right is absurd. No money=none of the rights he mentions. But the basic human rights are always there as they cost nothing. We are born with them. It took the founding fathers of this (once great) country to enumerate them and put them to paper as the law of the land.</p>

<p>About that he is quite correct.  As whites twilight and are replaced by a new electorate, the Constitution of the US will either be completely rewritten to reflect an authoritarian government and command-control economy or, more likely, &#8220;disappeared&#8221; completely</p>
<p>The only good news:  Both Jacksons, père et fils, will find their shake-down abilities highly curtailed by the new regime; that is if they survive the statist transformation they are calling for now.  </p>
<p>The new authoritarian masters who will soon in power (and they won&rsquo;t be black) have no use for black grievances, or for blacks themselves.  When blacks&rsquo; purpose is served, that of destroying white America, they too will be disappeared.</p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The man obviously doesn&rsquo;t understand federalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>He understands neither Federalism nor Economics.  He doesn&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>He is only interested in Power and Money and he&rsquo;s not going to let an Old Document written on Animal Parchment by Dead White Slaveholders stand in his way.  His education came at the knee of his father who taught him how to shake down major corporations for fun and major profit.  You can ask Coca-cola, Viacom and Coors about that.</p>
<p>After all, he and his father co-wrote a book entitled &#8220;It&rsquo;s About Money!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobs had better hand over the free computers and ipods and any other gadgets Jr. demands in the name of &#8220;oppressed&#8221; black children, along with a hefty monetary or stock &#8220;donation&#8221;, and toot sweet, lest he find himself the target of a boycott or explaining to authorities why there is a dearth of black programmers working for Apple (dot Indians to not count, but Jobs will get credit for not hiring whites).   </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s always worked for his father.</p>

		<p>If all those things are the government&rsquo;s responsibility, that means that the government also needs the power to force families to only have a small number of children, to force people to work, to force people not to do things bad for their health, to force black students to study as many hours a day as required for them to absorb a decent education (it would be significantly more than for white students), etc.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind that kind of big government that took on the personal responsibilities some people have proven incapable of taking on. But I know other people would hate it, including those like Jesse Jackson Jr. He only understands the idea of receiving free stuff, not the idea of being made to do what&rsquo;s necessary to make it work.</p>

		<p>Jackson appears to not have visited any ghettoes or barrios in quite a while. All the kids there have ipods and laptops. They also have large televisions, satilite/cable, DVD&rsquo;s in their cars, the latest cell phones, name brand clothes and shoes &hellip; Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there are a lot of poor folks in the ghettoes and barrios that I visit regularly but it is not the kids.

		<p>The first thing Karl Marx stated in his communist manifesto of 1848 was that it was the duty of every dedicated Communist to work for the complete abolition of private property.</p>
<p>Obviously, Jackson never learned the lessons of Jamestown and Plymouth.<br>
What were those lessons? They can be summarized in America&rsquo;s traditional 4-step formula: <br>
                                                          Incentive produces labor, labor produces production, production produces abundance.<br>
 <br>
Incentive-Labor-Production-Abundance.</p>
<p>Giving away property to millions of white lemmings and even millions more non-whites from historically socialist governments is a certain path to America&rsquo;s destruction.<br>

<p>College is NOT for everyone, no matter what the left and multiculturalists say. Look what happened when they let that mental case Seug hui Cho into Virginia Tech. He wound up killing 32 people there, before committing suicide.</p>
