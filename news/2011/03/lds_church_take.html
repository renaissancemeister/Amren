			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peggy Fletcher Stack, Salt Lake Tribune, March 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The LDS Church stepped from the sidelines on immigration reform and squarely onto the playing field Tuesday by sending Presiding Bishop H. David Burton to attend and speak at Gov. Gary Herbert&rsquo;s signing ceremony for four bills passed by the Utah Legislature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our presence here testifies to the fact that we are appreciative of what has happened in the Legislature this session,&#8221; Burton said at the signing, indicating it was no accident or private decision. &#8220;We feel the Legislature has done an incredible job on a very complex issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Burton&rsquo;s presence was an extraordinarily public endorsement for the LDS Church, which typically prefers to work in the background. And it has supporters and critics from within the faith scrambling to know how to react.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has abandoned its claims to neutrality on these bills.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both supporters and opponents agree that the church&rsquo;s endorsement of the Utah Compact and its involvement in the legislative process was a game-changer.</p>
<p>If the Utah Legislature had been in session right after Arizona passed its stringent immigration law, the Beehive State &#8220;likely would have gotten the same thing,&#8221; said Paul Mero, president of the conservative Sutherland Institute.</p>
<p>But with LDS Church support for immigration reform, Mero said, &#8220;We&rsquo;ve had a 180[-degree] turn in this state. Culturally, more and more folks understand how reasonable comprehensive reform is compared to enforcement only.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sen. Stuart Reid, R-Ogden, echoed that sentiment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question that the Utah Compact, with the church&rsquo;s endorsement, made a significant difference to me and others in the Legislature who helped craft immigration legislation,&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of Utah lawmakers are LDS.</p>
<p>But it has left faithful Mormons who support strict enforcement of immigration laws grappling with the message from their ecclesiastical leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am shocked that the church would support a bill that literally sacrifices 50,000 Utah children, who are the victims of identity theft, for the benefit of illegal aliens,&#8221; Mortensen said. &#8220;The church has sent so many conflicting messages, I just don&rsquo;t know where they are coming from.&#8221;</p>
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t destroyed his faith in the church, he said. &#8220;My faith is stronger than that, but it disappoints me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arturo Morales-LLan, head of Legal Immigrants for Immigration Law Enforcement, supports the enforcement-only bill by Rep. Stephen Sandstrom, R-Orem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Latino activist said he met with Herbert shortly after the signing ceremony and that the governor assured him that Burton was there as an invited guest and the church had &#8220;no involvement&#8221; in the bills.</p>
<p>That has left Morales-LLan feeling confused with what he sees as the church&rsquo;s conflicting messages  &mdash;  to obey the law or support what he sees as &#8220;amnesty&#8221; for lawbreakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The debate is vital to Utah&rsquo;s Latino population, many of whom are LDS. [Latino activist Tony] Yapias and others estimate that 50 percent to 75 percent of members in Utah&rsquo;s 100-plus Spanish-speaking congregations are undocumented. That includes many bishops, branch presidents, even stake presidents. The church sends missionaries among undocumented immigrants across the country, baptizing many of them without asking about their status. It also allows them to go to the church&rsquo;s temples and on missions.</p>
<p>Sen. Ross Romero, D-Salt Lake City, didn&rsquo;t support the immigration bills, arguing that immigration is a federal  &mdash;  not state  &mdash;  issue. But the first Latino minority leader in the Legislature said he was happy to see &#8220;a more compassionate&#8221; approach than the original enforcement-only efforts. He applauds his own religious leader, Utah Catholic Bishop John Wester, for his outspoken defense of undocumented immigrants.</p>

		<p>Would that be the same LDS that disallowed African-Americans from any leadership role until the 1970s? The same LDS that in the earlier editions of the Book of Mormon said that in heaven the curse (their word) of not being white is lifted? My times change. </p>

		<p>Well, thanks a lot, LDS!  We have so many problems in this country and you move to ramp up the ante in re the illegals!  We need the illegals OUT of this country, not IN!!!  What, are you all thinking you can convert the Mexicans to LDS?  Maybe some of them.  Most of them are die-hard Catholics; it&rsquo;s a cultural tradition with them.  Maybe we&rsquo;ll all be referring to this as &#8220;The Mormon Mistake&#8221; in the future&hellip;.</p>

		<p>The church has made a tragic mistake and has created an internal division that will not heal. Utah will now become a mecca for the illegals and eventually destroy the financial health of the state.</p>
<p>This is the fate of every church that believes their vision of morality trumps the laws of the nations in which they are welcomed. Utah will pay a high price for this high-handed act of &#8220;progressive&#8221; morality.</p>

		<p>Globalist power consolidation in effect. LDS follows that path of other western Christian faiths and betray their own faithful following. </p>
<p>Just makes you realize all these are corporate institutions and have little to do with God. </p>
<p>This move reduces Mormon quality of life. Opens the door to evil. Kidnappings and home invasions are done over 90% by illegals. </p>

		<p>I was/am a covert to the LDS church. Most White LDS members are really good people. For some reason, the LDS church managed to avoid most of the cultural marxist corruptions of the 1960s that destroyed mainline Protestant churches.</p>
<p>The killer here is the Christian mission to preach the gospel to all nations. Most Christian churches have done this at some time, and it always results in the non Whites accepting the Christian gospel under the idea that they then get to enjoy the same lifestyle, live in the same nice, clean place as these nice White Christians sharing&hellip;</p>
<p>Everything the Whites have.</p>
<p>The LDS Church used to be 90% plus White American, concentrated in the West. But that&rsquo;s just changed. </p>
<p>Maybe it will have an educational effect when Salt Lake City has the problems of East LA.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lose hope - it is generally just the reality that these anti White corruptions come in at the top of all formerly White institutions - political parties, labor unions, churches. </p>
<p>Just go local and feel free to insult, rebel against corrupt elites from John McCaine, to the Bush Family to now the top of the LDS church.</p>

		<p> This decision serves two purposes. First it makes the leadership feel good as they love to fill the pews with people regardless of race. Second it secures their 509c tax exempt status so the money they collect is still tax free.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been changed for a long time.  If you read 19th century history closely, you will find that Mormons sent out missions to establish Mormon communities throughout the West.  In the California Gold Country, there was even a way station called &#8220;Mormon Island&#8221; very near present day Folsom, California.  But that is just one of hundreds of Mormon &#8220;island states&#8221; that the Mormons sought to establish everywhere.  Remember, at that time, Brigham Young was trying to set up a theocracy that would compete with the U.S. in the West, until the U.S. Army was sent to Salt Lake City to put down the momentum of it.  Along the way, there were incidents like the &#8220;Mountain Meadows Massacre&#8221; where some Mormons dressed up as Indians and slaughtered a wagon train convoy of Southern Whites.  Mormons also were very opportunist otherwise, charging for rescue services, and even sending groups on known dangerous routes (due to Indian raiding) that caused several well known massacres of fellow whites.  Other remarkable early history includes deceptive recruiting of English females for the purpose of polygamous marriages, which some escaped or avoided upon landing in America after learning the truth.</p>
<p>But my major point is that I have met Mormon missionaries all over Europe.  They have been out there for decades.  I first met one while flying back to the U.S. from England.  She had been in Germany for a couple years.  When I was living in Slovenia, I saw them on the street and about, the usual two young men in white shirts and black ties.  One evening, two rang my door and there they were, looking like some sort of American government agents with those silly &#8220;Elder&#8221; badges on, trying to spread Mormonism in Eastern Europe.  I met American Protestant missionaries, and even met some old Slovenian women who had become JWs!</p>
<p>We meddle in the world in every way imaginable.  Our religious organizations go about sewing fear and offering asylum in America to many if they convert.  And they don&rsquo;t care what color they are.  No wonder so many people out there, including Europeans and Eastern Europeans, are always so annoyed with us.  We interlope into older cultures and prey on the susceptible, making every excuse for it being righteous to do so.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, it is all about business.  Religion is a business, and a privileged one at that (no taxes).  If we finally established taxes for religion, it would go a long ways in cleaning out the riff-raff and paying down our national debts.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately the article isn&rsquo;t very informative about the actual provisions of the laws passed.  From the comments, they are not good for &#8220;our&#8221; side.  Leftists are praising the church&rsquo;s commitment to &#8220;social justice&#8221;.  For me, that phrase means that the church has lost its way. (To be fair, the people who are using it are not authorized represntatives of the church).</p>
<p>Lot of angry people over there. This will be interesting.  It&rsquo;s different from the 1978 &#8220;revelation&#8221; that the curse of Cain had been revoked; the church is just ignoring its own professed belief in &#8220;honoring, obeying and sustaining the law&#8221;. This will damage it. How badly, remains to be seen.</p>

		<p>Mexicans know that the Mormon Church is great with their (White tithes) giving out freebies&hellip;along with the welfare state that WE pay for, the mexicans will make out like bandidos from the Mormon Church&hellip;The Mormons are only following the Catholic and Protestant &#8220;teachings&#8221;(untruths) in the last few decades of a liberal, socialist Jesus, who was for the nonwhites over the White people. </p>
<p>Anyone who believes these teachings that supposedly came from Jesus is a fool! But then again MOST White Christians have become utter fools as the Bible states. </p>

		<p>The Mormon church is a business and nothing more. I know, my family WAS Mormon for years and I taught a predominantly Mormon school for almost eight years. The Mormon god is MAMMON. <br/>
The LDS church is worth countless billions of dollars. The church owns malls all over the country. It owns Pizza Hut, Pepsi and a lot more. By going along with the pro-illegal immigrant government in Washington, it hopes to maintain its tax-exempt status. Furthermore, it favors a cheap labor force for its businesses. Apparently, it has even managed to overcome its tradition of racism in favor of the almighty dollar, for it hopes to get all those tithes from new Mormons from Mexico. Oh, for those that believe that the Mormons have a good system of charity going, what you don&rsquo;t know is that any Mormon (they help only MORMONS WHO ARE IN GOOD STANDING) who wants help from them has to WORK for it-at effective rates well below the minimum wage! I have no doubt that &#8220;DESERET INDUSTRIES&#8221; makes a large profit for the church too. Mormons possess no charitable feelings.<br/>
Besides being a group of obese, rosy-cheeked, greedy traitors planning to become gods in the afterlife, the Mormon leadership is a gang of hypocrites as well. <br/>
Let me give you a small sample of Mormon hypocrisy: <br/>
When I was a kid in the church, we couldn&rsquo;t drink any caffeinated products (because of &#8220;the word of wisdom&#8221;). But once the Church bought Pepsi, it was okay to drink SOME caffeinated products&hellip;like Pepsi! I am waiting for the church to buy into Philip-Morris and Jack Daniels, so then Mormons can smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol.<br/>
Down with the Mormon Church! Let&rsquo;s tax it, because IT IS JUST A MONEY MAKING BUSINESS!</p>
