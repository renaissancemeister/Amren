<h1><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2011/03/02/alabama-gop-blacks-misbehave/">Alabama GOP Official Explains Racial Disparities in Schools: &#8216;Blacks Misbehave&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tanya Somanader, Think Progress, March 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The [U.S. Department of Justice&rsquo;s Civil Rights Division] listed &#8220;several outstanding desegregation issues that the school district [Huntsville, Alabama] must address,&#8221; including &#8220;that predominantly black schools have too few advanced courses&#8221; and &#8220;that black children at predominantly white schools are punished and suspended at alarming rates.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Hugh McInnish, a member of the Madison County Republican Executive Committee who also sits on the state Republican Executive Committee, set out to school the DOJ on the real reason racial disparities exist in Hunstville: &#8220;Life is unfair.&#8221; In a press conference at his gated community and a letter responding to the DOJ last week, McInnish offered a litany of bizarre &#8220;proof&#8221; that racial disparity isn&rsquo;t &#8220;manmade,&#8221; claiming &#8220;blacks misbehave on average more frequently than whites do,&#8221; and that black students are unable to perform as well as white students. {snip}<br/>
McInnish went so far as to include in his letter a chart that purports to show the &#8220;black crime rate as (a) multiple of (the) white crime rate.&#8221; The chart indicates that black people commit more than six times the violent crime of white people overall; it has them committing about eight times as many murders as white people and more than 14 times as many robberies.[ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ]</p>
<p>McInnish also argued Tuesday that the gap between white and black students&rsquo; participation in advanced courses is not because black students are not afforded the chance, as alleged in the Justice Department letter.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, the gap exists because black students are not able to perform as well in advanced classes.</p>
<p>{snip} [Most] of McInnish&rsquo;s data is cribbed from the right-wing New Century Foundation (NCF), which, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is a &#8220;self-styled think tank&#8221; that propagates &#8220;academic racism.&#8221; Dedicated &#8220;to the ideal of the United States as a white European nation,&#8221; NCF also publishes the American Renaissance  &mdash;  a magazine that &#8220;publishes frequent articles on the discredited field of eugenics&#8221; which is &#8220;selective breeding to improve human genetic stock.&#8221; Incidentally, the foundation&rsquo;s &#8220;most important publication&#8221; is The Color Of Crime (which, to NCF, is black.)</p>
<p>If McInnish ever stepped out of his gated community, he might actually discover that there is absolutely no evidence that African American students &#8220;act out more&#8221; but rather that &#8220;suspension and expulsion is evidence of a pervasive and systematic bias&#8221; that&rsquo;s been present &#8220;for the past 25 years.&#8221; But McInnish spends more time posting editorials on the white supremacist site VDare, and publishing the news aggregater Suppressed News which includes insightful comments like &#8220;Black on black racism is OK. White on black racism for the same reason is not. When are we going to wake up?&#8221;</p>

								<h2>Letter of Hugh McInnish to the Justice Department, February 28, 2011</h2>
						<p>Hugh McInnish<br/>
mcinnish@comcast.net<br/>
February 28, 2011</p>
<p>Ms. Allison R. Brown<br/>
Trial Attorney<br/>
U.S. Department of Justice<br/>
Civil Rights Division<br/>
Educational Opportunities Section<br/>
Washington, DC 20004</p>
<p>Dear Ms. Brown:</p>
<p>Your letter of 16 February to Mr. J. R. Brooks concerning the Huntsville schools has been widely circulated, and a copy has fallen into my hands. May I have your permission to offer you a few comments?</p>
<p>Since you don&rsquo;t know me, I will briefly introduce myself. I am neither a lawyer nor an educator, but a retired engineer. Although retired, I still do some consulting work. My interest in the schools is as a parent, a grandparent, and above all as a very concerned citizen. I have lived in Huntsville since 1964. As I proceed I believe that you will see that, for better or for worse, my viewpoint will be a new one. Some of my words, though not so intended, will perhaps be offensive to some, but they must be said.</p>
<p>My comments will be concentrated on the subjects of Student Assignment and Student Discipline.</p>
<p>In regard to course offerings you point out that white Challenger Middle School had students enrolled in 29 sections of advanced programming, while black Davis Hills Middle School had only nine enrolled. You then compared predominately white Hampton Cove Middle School with predominately black Ed White Middle School. The first had 31 advanced and the last had 14.</p>
<p>An advanced programming course is bound to be challenging and for which only those with the most ability and preparation are suited. And it is certainly true that mathematical ability and proficiency in reading is a good measure of such. The chart below shows the two pairs of schools which you compare. Note that the black-white gap in math is, in each of the pairs, about 50 percentile points, and in reading about 45. It is altogether plausible that this gap accounts for the difference in the number of advanced programming courses offered. Being called &#8220;advanced&#8221; means that it is not for the ordinary student, but for the exceptional student. Turning to the high schools, You make comparisons among Grissom, Huntsville, and Butler, pointing out the differences between the enrollment numbers in the advanced courses between predominately white Grissom and Huntsville on the one hand, and predominately black Butler on the other. The chart below is pertinent to this point. It shows the percentage of students at each school who scored in Achievement Level IV, the highest achievement level as measured by the Alabama Reading and Math Test (the ARMT). Since these are the most advanced students, it is only logical that those selected for advanced courses would come mostly, if not entirely, from among them. As the chart shows, we can only expect a few students from Butler to be selected for the advanced courses.</p>
<p>Finally there are the elementary schools. Here you compare the relatively high numbers of students in five largely white schools enrolled in advanced courses with the smaller numbers in largely black Lakewood and Rolling Hills. You will probably anticipate what I might say here and I will spare you the needless redundancy. The chart below makes the point similar to that I have made regarding the elementary and high schools.</p>
<p>You also discuss the lack of black-white parity in advanced courses in schools that are predominately white. The data broken down by race in each school is incomplete, but would almost certainly show the same pattern as here if it were available.</p>
<p>You conclude your discussion of the disparities between the white and black schools in regard to advanced course offerings with the statement that, &#8220;Thus black students in the predominately black schools in the District were not afforded the same opportunity to enroll in advanced courses as their peers in the predominately white schools, and black students in predominately white schools were not enrolling in advanced courses at nearly the same rate as their white peers.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think I am safe in saying that in order to enter an advanced course a student must (1) be an exceptional student, and (2) ask for such a course. You have not presented any evidence that any student has requested an advanced course and been denied, either because the course was not being offered or for any other reason. Further, you have given no evidence that where advanced courses are offered and the number of blacks enrolled is disproportionately low, that the disparity is due to the blacks being excluded from the courses or discouraged from enrolling. In brief, there is no evidence that opportunities are being denied blacks, and the leap from the observation of the number of black participants to the conclusion that the numbers prove a lack of opportunity is a non sequitur of monumental proportions.</p>
<p>I turn now to your discussion of student discipline. You correctly state that, &#8220;There are significant racial disparities in student discipline throughout the District, with black students bearing the weight of these disparities.&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8220;disparity&#8221; does not equal unfairness, and once again we have a non sequitur. You have given no evidence that the procedure for enforcing discipline is more harsh or more lenient toward one race or the other. Nor have you cited any specific case in which the discipline has been unfair. Look at the chart below. It shows the disparities between black and white adults being disciplined for serious crimes. Certainly the misbehavior of students is not felonious, and their offenses are not comparable to these. Still, the regrettable fact is that with this gross disparity between the races in the adult population there should be no incredulity in finding it in the younger generation. Note that these are crime rates, not absolute numbers.</p>
<p> The black-white gap is highly visible here in Huntsville, but no more so than anywhere else. It is omnipresent in the country, and nowhere has anyone found a way to remove it. Richard Posner, the famed jurist of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, has remarked, that if a remedy could be found in a court order, such an order would already have been issued. And I can almost hear him say under his breath, &#8220;&hellip; constitutional or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the roots of this disparity, they do not grow from anything school officials have done or have not done. If there is unfairness, it is because life is unfair. The unfairness is not manmade. There is manmade unfairness in this scenario, however, and it is this: It is unfair to the school system and to the community to demand that they correct a problem that is not of their making, and about which they can do little or nothing.</p>
<p>My closing comment will be directed to one of your closing comments. Near the end of your letter you write, &#8220;During my visit to the District in 2007, parents, students, and community members complained about the HVAC at Johnson High School and the lack of air conditioning there.&#8221; It is ironic and amusing that this is the single concrete example you offer of something amiss. You are probably much younger than I am (most people are these days), so your experiences will not track mine. But when I was in school the very thought of an air conditioned classroom, if anyone was capable of such a thought, would have been preposterous. Even in college I only enjoyed such a luxury the last term before I graduated. To cite such a trivial fault looks to me like an admission of the paucity of substantive issues.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions for me I would be glad to address them.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>

Does anyone seriously believe this? Why does the &#8220;systematic bias&#8221; persist &#8220;for the past 25 years&#8221; unless reality reinforces it? <br/>

		<p> Bravo, Mr. McInish! It seems to me that you&rsquo;ve pretty well documented your statements. The &#8220;Think Progress&#8221; writer&rsquo;s sneering sarcasm notwithstanding, all the things you said have been proven, in one way or another, in one place or another.</p>
<p> And by the way, I&rsquo;d like to ask the writer what the fact that you live in a &#8220;gated community&#8221; has to do with your letter or the problems with blacks in the Huntsville school district. None, of course; it&rsquo;s simply a sneaky writer&rsquo;s device to try to make you appear to be an &#8220;elitist White male&#8221; who lives a privileged life.</p>
<p> To sum up: It appears that the writer has taken a page from the book of the late comedian Chico Marx when it comes to the causes of black failure: &#8220;Who you gonna believe   &mdash;   liberal revealed truths, or your own lyin&rsquo; eyes?!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Differences between racial behavior can partially be explained by the number of generations a racial group has been practicing agriculture. The life of a paleolithic hunter is exciting, varied, and filled with risk. Agriculture selects for self discipline, a tendency to plan for the future, and tolerance for boredom.  <br/>
 <br/>
Urban living places additional population pressure on superior intelligence. Those who are able to become merchants, government officials, skilled craftsmen, and so on live better lives than manual laborers, and have more descendants generations later. </p>

		<p>Wow! Great stuff! McInnish for Governor! No&hellip;PRESIDENT! The commenters at that leftwing rag are drooling in anticipation of the &#8220;media meatgrinder&#8221; they hope will destroy this honest man. More telling will be the reaction of the Alabama Republican leadership. Note that McInnish avoided any reference to the black / white IQ gap, which would have thrown gasoline on the fire &amp; would be used against him&hellip;smart strategy. This guy is one cool cat. I don&rsquo;t think they will be able to bring him down. ROLL TIDE! (&#8216;course, being an engineer, he probably went to Auburn) so&hellip;WAR EAGLE!!!</p>

<p>Well, Hugh McInnish obviously has some backbone and I hope that every person who frequents this site will take the time and write to him and thank him for having the courage to speak out in a rational way.</p>
<p>Not all of us are retired like Mr. McInnish and cannot speak out in such a way for fear of retribution.  But at least we can privately offer our support. <br/>

Better yet, go have a discussion with some of those same teachers. And yes indeed Ms. Somanader, when ARE you going to wake up?

		<p>Tanya Somanader doesn&rsquo;t refute anything he wrote with facts instead just name calls.  Black people being ill-mannered is well-known, it&rsquo;s something that can&rsquo;t be denied.  Whenever black people get money they move away from black people to get away from the dysfunction.  Black people like to point to slavery and segregation as to why they perform badly in schools as if they lived in a parallel world as Europeans with written languages and schools before supposedly white people ruined everything during slavery.  Black Africans produced NO written language, there were no schools, no two parent system, and only a few hundred years before European explorers arrived did a single culture in Nigeria produce a calendar.  The legacy of not producing a written language lives on and is a major factor in why black people perform badly in schools.</p>

LOL&hellip;.Even the most hardcore leftists I know dont believe that. They tell me they know blacks are responsible for more crime and &#8220;acting out&#8221;, but that there is a reason for this misbehaviour that exonerates them of their actions. The lame excuses I usually hear is this anti social behaviour is due to white racism, the legacy of slavery, etc. But at least they acknowlege that blacks disproportionately cause more problems. This Ms Somanander seems to have a problem accepting this reality. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to believe that someone is so stupid and/or ignorant as to disbelieve valid statistics coming from the biased Dept. of Justice, which, if anything, fudges figures in order to show blacks in a less favorable light.</p>
<p>Anybody who has went to school with large numbers of blacks doesn&rsquo;t need stats to know blacks behave worse than any other group and anybody who denies that fact is a fool.  This reporter-dreg obviously has never had the misfortune to know up close and personal the real world.</p>
<p>It is these types I hope will someday have the misfortune of learning first hand how much pathology exists in the black community.</p>

Political correctness means lying on behalf of social harmony. I doubt many liberals genuinely believe that the races are of equal quality, or would be if not for &#8220;white racism.&#8221; They say things they know are not true in order to please their black and white liberal friends. <br/>
 <br/>
The real problem is that they enforce lying, and punish those who tell the truth. </p>

		<p>&#8220;If McInnish ever stepped out of his gated community, he might actually discover that there is absolutely no evidence that African American students &ldquo;act out more&rdquo; but rather that &ldquo;suspension and expulsion is evidence of a pervasive and systematic bias&rdquo; that&rsquo;s been present &ldquo;for the past 25 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Just as poster #8 mentioned, this author needs to get out into the real world and take a look at what&rsquo;s going on.  I taught in a mostly black school for three years and a partially black school for seven years.  90% of the time if there is trouble in the class, in the hall, in the street it was being done by you know who.  It was my experience teaching a diverse array of blacks that convinced me that I would never send my kids to public school.  Can you imagine putting your prescious little darlings in a class with gang members?  Black people mostly don&rsquo;t seem to care, as evidenced by the fact that you have all black schools and no one is willing to teach the bad ones a lesson.</p>

		<p>As someone who unfortunately attended majority black schools up until the 8th grade, I can assure you that black children behave horribly.  And the few who don&rsquo;t are treated horribly&hellip; by other blacks, including the black teachers and administrators.   Blacks seem hell bent on being bad citizens from cradle to grave. </p>

		<p>McInnish is right.  I taught for one whole year (the longest and most miserable of my entire career) at a predominantly black school.  The violence level at that school, (and we are talking an ELEMENTARY school!) was higher than at any other school I taught at subsequently.  First graders were heaving bricks over the wall that separated the kindergarten play area from the regular playground.  Dark black kids called lighter black kids the N-word, and the parents of the &#8220;victim&#8221; tried to blame us teachers for it.  When I refused to take the blame, the parent called me a racist and took his kid out of my class.  No loss   &mdash;   it was one less pain in the rear for me to deal with.  The kids could not stay in their seats in class.  I did not dare turn my back on them to write on the board (and these were first graders).  It was, in fact, the worst year of my life.  I can&rsquo;t believe I stuck it out, looking back on it.  Yes, Mr. McInnish, you are ABSOLUTELY correct - black kids DO act out more and they are far more violent than Hispanics, Asians, or whites.  I know this from hard experience, and that cannot be disputed.</p>

		<p>Every so often the local liberal rag here runs an article about how blacks are punished in the high schools more than whites, inferring it is racial discrimination. Several times I have contacted the school board, and gotten their statistics on suspensions and other discipline. Not only are blacks punished more as the liberal says, but so are male students punished more often that females.</p>
<p>Any honest person with a brain in their head can see that it is not discrimination, but behavior that is the cause for the disparity. Boys misbehave in ways that cause them to be disciplined more often than girls, and blacks do so more than whites.</p>
<p>Only a liar, a fool, or a lying fool would try to make the disparities anything other than what they are  &mdash;  behavior, not discrimination.</p>

<p>The Indiana U study cited above is a fraud; having collected all the data on the over-harsh treatment of blacks by some midwest school district, we might have been presented all of the relevant totals- the raw and proportional numbers for all offenses (not just those most black or white), data on repeat offenders, and punishment by offense and race. </p>

		<p>Every white person including this one who has attended schools where blacks are present know what Mr. McInnish said is the truth. More blacks act disruptive every chance they get than the ones who don&rsquo;t, and this is especially true of males. I grew up with a few who did apply themselves in school, but the ones who come from families where education is looked down upon are the ones who disrupt the classroom continually. That is when they are not assaulting, stabbing, shooting or raping each other or white students, dealing drugs or gang banging. They misbehave all the time, and that jeopardizes the education those of all races who want to learn and make something of themselves. These misbehaving blacks along with all the other non-whites who will not behave in class should be expelled from normal classes and put in detention, because they are determined to be in jail. If it were up to me, they&rsquo;d be used as cannon fodder.</p>

		<p>As a 28 y/o engineering graduate student, I can assure you that my colleagues are well aware of the differences in intellectual capacity amongst the races.

		<p>Without appearing to be prejudice, I do submit that everyone whom has ever had to teach Black students, the story is always the same:  most Black students present problems in the classroom that White and Mexican students do not.  Why is this?</p>
<p>I think most educators know the reason for this, and that reason is the fact that Blacks are less intelligent than Whites, but still, Black students are mainstreamed into normal classrooms.  </p>
<p>In order to increase Mathematicians and Scientists graduating from our schools, then the Black children MUST be sent to schools where teachers that have been trained to managed these students.  In addition, everyone talks about how badly Black Students behave in White Schools and perhaps also in Black schools, but no study, as far as I know, has been conducted to identify why this distinction exists.  It is as if to conduct this type of study, means that Whites and other races are profiling the Black Race, which would not be true.  Therefore, instead of talking about and complain about the appearance of the inferiority of the Black Race, commence a sanctified study to determine why Black students present inferior behavior in White classrooms.  A study is required to be conducted, because the results might find, that through a scientific study, a medicine could be discovered to assist Blacks in all levels of their lives, which could assist them to better ASSIMILATE, rather than to ISOLATE themselves further.</p>

		<p>I agree, we need teaches who keep an aluminum baseball bat on the desk, trained in judo or some other marital art, and know how to motivate children in the right way to behave and learn. One of my teachers was ironically enough a black man who was also a veteran. He knew how to get respect from the students and give it in return.  I think men who have been in the military that trained other members of the military are the ones who could reign in even a class room full of rowdy blacks, and at the same time they could be the first real positive male role model these kids have ever had in their lives. White, or not, it would in the long run make things better for whites, and non-whites alike.</p>
