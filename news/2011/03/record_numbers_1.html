			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Whitehead, Telegraph (London), Feb. 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A record number of migrants were allowed to make the UK their home last year as figures revealed Labour&rsquo;s final legacy.</p>
<p>Almost a quarter of a million people were granted settlement  &mdash;  the highest since records began  &mdash;  and a third of those were due to a failure by the last Government to deal with historic asylum claims.</p>
<p>There was also a 41 per cent rise in foreign students while net migration  &mdash;  the difference between those arriving and those leaving  &mdash;  hit a three year high in what proved to be Labour&rsquo;s last year in office.</p>
<p>Separate figures confirmed that 3.2 million foreign migrants were added to the UK population during the party&rsquo;s 13 years in power.</p>
<p>A series official statistics published yesterday show for the first time what faced the incoming Coalition Government and its headache in meeting a pledge to reduce immigration to the &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said: &#8220;These figures are Labour&rsquo;s legacy to Britain  &mdash;  3.2 million immigrants including a quarter of a million in their last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over half a million students in one year, with no interviews before arrival and no checks on departures; and a points-based system that has increased immigration not reduced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what they called &#8216;managed migration&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be hard to imagine after 13 years in charge a more shambolic inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 12 months to last September a total of 238,950 people were granted settlement  &mdash;  the highest figure since records in the 1960s, according to the Home Office.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands were granted settlement as part of the desperate clearing of the so-called asylum legacy backlog, where up to 450,000 unconcluded cases, some dating back to the 1990s, were discovered in 2006.</p>
<p>Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed in the year to June 2010 some 226,000 more migrants moved to the UK than left, the highest level since 2007.</p>
<p>The Coalition has pledged to cut net migration from the &#8220;hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands&#8221; but is facing an upward trend in the figures.</p>
<p>And student numbers also continued to soar in Labour&rsquo;s final year, with a 41 per cent increase in those arriving for at least a year.</p>
<p>Some 234,000 came to study in the 12 months to last June compared with 166,000 in the previous year.</p>
<p>Overall, some 362,080 student visas were issued over the period, including to those coming for less than a year, representing a 35 per cent annual rise.</p>
<p>Damian Green, the immigration minister, said: &#8220;These statistics reinforce once again why we are radically reforming the immigration system to bring net migration down to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to exert steady downward pressure to ensure those who come and make a positive contribution to our society are welcomed, those who have no right to be here are refused and those who break our rules are removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have already introduced an annual limit on economic migration and throughout 2011 will be proposing tighter restrictions on student, marriage and settlement routes which have in the past been subject to widespread abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other figures yesterday showed the number of failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants being removed from the UK has hit a five-year low.</p>
<p>Some 57,085 either left voluntarily or were deported last year, down 15 per cent, according to the Home Office.</p>
<p>However, officials said that was mainly due to a large drop in the number of cases being refused at a port, which used to be included in removal statistics.<br>

<p>My reaction:  Sorry, wrong answer.  Labour didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;lose control&rdquo; of Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;borders,&rdquo; (BTW, how does one lose control of a OCEAN?  It&rsquo;s not like you&rsquo;ve got 2,000 miles of empty desert to patrol), the real answer is that Labour wanted the borders open in order to import new Labour voters.</p>
<p>And for a government that consists of a string-bean coalition between open borders Tories and open borders Learning Disableds to rap Labour&rsquo;s knuckles for being open border is a wee bit hypocritical, don&rsquo;t we think?  Don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s just David Cameron and his new brand of liberal conservatism that&rsquo;s the cause for the Tories being for open borders  &mdash;  Even Margaret Thatcher liked to pop off about &ldquo;Muslim family values.&rdquo; </p>

<p>How typical, half-measures to be introduced as &ldquo;immigration reform,&rdquo; should be the title of this article. Mr. Green, like so many &ldquo;Conservative&rdquo; politicians throughout the West, has not a clue about what number of nonwhite immigrants should be let into a white country. That number does not have 10 zeros in it or even two of them either, it has only one 0! </p>
<p>Also, &ldquo;migrations&rdquo; are not the only problem; dismantling the entire odious apparatus of multiculturalism is by far the more pressing problem and punishing without mercy its practitioners and enforcers, regardless of party affiliation. These &ldquo;migrations&rdquo; are simply a symptom of that larger cancer.</p>
<p>Enough said!</p>

		<p>Why not just &#8220;stop&#8221; all immigration and encourage non-whites to emmigrate?  The British Isles aren&rsquo;t all that large and certainly do not need to be over run.</p>

		<p>If you care to google the &#8216;Andrew Neather scandal&rsquo; you will see that the Labour Party&rsquo;s open door policy of massive uncontrolled immigration was actually a deliberate, cold, calculated plan whose sole objective was to permanently alter Britain&rsquo;s racial balance so that Whites would be reduced to minority status and Britain would become a &#8216;world government&rsquo; microcosm, with a permanent Labour government, of course.<br>
  And by the way, Andrew Neather was a very senior Labour Party apparatchik, with the ear of the highest echelons, who foolishly let slip in an arrogant and supecilious newspaper article.</p>

		<p>Getting immigration down to &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; is too little, too late. How about showing people that you&rsquo;re serious with a COMPLETE MORATORIUM on all immigration, asylum, etc.??? And then get down to the brass tacks of DEPORTING most of those 3.2 million free loaders who shouldn&rsquo;t have been admitted in the first place. That&rsquo;s when we&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re serious, Mr Green.</p>

		<p><i>Almost a quarter of a million people were granted settlement &mdash; the highest since records began</i></p>
<p>Resettling muslims and other non/whites in native British territory is only part of the equation; the other is disparate birthrates between white Britons and muslims, guaranteeing that GB will be over-run in the next few decades and Sharia Law will become inevitable.</p>
<p>Populations under great stress do not reproduce. The white fertility rate of white Britons is 1.6 per woman, for Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and Somalis it is 5.0 per woman, three times the number of children as whites. </p>
<p>That is the conundrum GB faces.  They could cut off all immigration right now but will still end up losing their country:</p>
<p><i>There are signs that Allah will grant victory to Islam in Europe without swords, without guns, without conquest. We don&rsquo;t need terrorists, we don&rsquo;t need homicide bombers. The 50 million Muslims will turn it into a Muslim continent within a few decades.</i></p>

		<p>Here is the infamous column by Andrew Neather:</p>
<p><i>Don&rsquo;t listen to the whingers - London needs immigrants</i></p>
<p><br>
https://tinyurl.com/yg92dc3</p>
<p>The relevant passages:</p>
<p><i>But this wave of immigration has enriched us much more than that. A large part of London&rsquo;s attraction is its cosmopolitan nature.  It is so much more international now than, say, 15 years ago, and so much more heterogeneous than most of the provinces, that it&rsquo;s pretty much unimaginable for us to go back either to the past or the sticks. </i></p>
<p><i>I remember coming away from some discussions with the clear sense that the policy was intended - even if this wasn&rsquo;t its main purpose - to rub the Right&rsquo;s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date. That seemed to me to be a manoeuvre too far.</i></p>
<p>One of the unresolved questions for the right is how do you deal with people who are as sick in the head as these people, who literally would commit genocide against their own people and culture for reasons of fashion and temporary political gain?  There has to come a point when you realize that bargaining with a lunatic is pointless.  Remember, this immigration wave is happening in a country with 61 million people crammed into an area about the size of Oregon.   </p>
