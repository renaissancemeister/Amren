<h1>An All-White Military Unit</h1>

<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On Monday, <a href="/" target="white" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>we reported</b></a> that something called the Military Leadership Diversity Commission says the officer corps of the American armed forces is too white and too male. &#8220;This problem will only become more acute as the racial, ethnic and cultural makeup of the United States continues to change,&#8221; the report adds.</p>
<p>A reader has sent us a group photo of the kind of men who go on to become officers. This photo was taken of the Marines of the 3rd Platoon of the 1st Force Recon., an elite unit. The brown-skinned fellows in the upper left are interpreters; everyone else is a useless white male.</p>
<p>The platoon strikes us as pretty formidable-looking unit, but no doubt the Military Leadership Diversity Commission would say it would be a lot more effective with a stiff dose of blacks, Hispanics and, of course, women.</p>

<p>The same question could be asked of Air Force pilots, of which 95 percent are white. </p>
<p>You are insane if you join the military and are white. They hate you. It&rsquo;s that simple after reading the above article. </p>

		<p> Could be a platoon of the Confederate Army, couldn&rsquo;t it? Wonder why all its members are White? Could it be that White guys tend to be more willing to take the jobs that are likely to result in &#8220;hard combat&#8221;? Recon platoons can run into most anything while they&rsquo;re doing their job   &mdash;   being &#8220;point men,&#8221; to use a Vietnam War phrase, for the main force.</p>
<p> But then, I seem to remember reading a while back that, while many blacks and Hispanics are staying for careers in the U.S. military nowadays, most of them choose roles as the &#8220;papertroopers of the chairborne corps&#8221;   &mdash;   that is, they want to punch a computer in an air-conditioned office   &mdash;   not fight the enemy! I realize that support troops are important to any military, but I still think it&rsquo;s a very telling statistic.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, the research staff of this commission which decided the military is not diverse enough is not very diverse itself: it&rsquo;s overwhelmingly female, 14 of 18 researchers, mostly from RAND - probably the kind of young, college educated women who have been indoctrinated with feminism &amp; egalitarianism from birth. The two ranking generals of the commission are black men, including the 80-something Julius Becton. I briefed Becton once, when he was CG of VII Corps in Germany in 1981. When I finished he had only one question, did I know the Army codeword for tampons, a large supply of which the sexually integrated support units had to carry with them on field operations. (Which had nothing to do with the subject of my briefing.)  I didn&rsquo;t know the codeword, but did know after this what an &#8220;affirmative action general&#8221; was. </p>

<p>With affirmative action, diversity and PC culture you never know if a black, mexican or woman can hack it.  This goes in any field.  Seeing this picture, I know each man can pull his own weight.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m one of the younger readers of American Renaissance. I am 22 years old and have been a regular reader and subscriber since 2006. I occasionally post anonymously.</p>
<p>I initially didn&rsquo;t go to college upon graduating high school, but instead chose to work retail for 2 years. I thought a lot about joining the Army during that time and enrolling in a non-combat MOS like a paralegal specialist. However, I decided against joining the Army, and I am very glad to have made this decision.</p>
<p>Perhaps the main thing that persuaded me against joining the Army was many of the conservative blogs and sites like American Renaissance which occasionally detail the embarrassing feminization of the military, which has now become a joke.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the remark that Gen. George Casey made about the terrorist attack at Ft. Hood. Instead of expressing grievance over the deaths of our soldiers, he was more concerned about &#8220;diversity being the greatest casualty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poltical correctness indeed has a stranglehold on the military, and it&rsquo;s people like Gen. George Casey that make me glad that I&rsquo;m a student at a university working on my BBA instead of getting shot at in Iraq or Afghanistan.</p>

		<p>I grew up with a guy that left highschool in the 1980s and became a member of the 82nd Airborne and then on to Rangers/Special Forces. He left the service after several years, but 09/11 ended up having him recalled to arms. As far as I know, he is currently deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq. A hard guy well into his forties and now an officer. </p>
<p>A few years ago, maybe mid 90s, he was showing a few of his friends-myself included-some photos of his unit during intense ranger training. The group photo showed only 1 black out of a platoon of forty or so. He explained that those few blacks that tried to go S.F. were almost always washed out due to the swimming requirement. He said bluntly &#8220;blacks sink!&#8221;</p>
<p>He also made the point that most of the guys who survived the grueling course would be described as &#8216;medium-sized&rsquo;. Really big grunts, despite high strength, etc, often can&rsquo;t hack the lack of sleep and don&rsquo;t get enough calories to sustain themselves on such an ordeal.</p>

		<p>For anyone who is familiar with the special forces selection and training process will know that the failure rate is close to 10 to 1. A woman would not survive the first day of the selection process. A &#8216;diversity&rsquo; might make it through the selection process but fail in the training phase,and many whites do. Successful candidates usually display a high intellect, a high level of physical stamina and the patience of JOB, are highly creative and able to function on their own merits. All critical leadership traits. In other words they are the best of the best. Many of these guys could probably have eased their way into West Point if they had been so inclined. Look for the government to screw this one up just like they have the service academies. I think anyone that is so inclined to do so could use this one as a good defense for Anglo European superiority.   </p>

<p>How do you expect your country to survive when its military has become feminized and radicalized through integration, women&rsquo;s issues, and homosexuality?</p>
<p>A fighting force that is weakened through the same process of corrosion that has eaten away the strength of our White Republic will NOT successfully defend us against the rising tide of color.</p>
<p>We are done. Beware and prepare.</p>

		<p>As Western governments keep writing billion dollar I.O.U.&rsquo;s, a global currency collapse is looking more likely.</p>
<p>One of the few positive things to come out of Afghanistan and Iraq is a generation of white males who have bonded in the profession of arms.</p>

		<p>So is the same policy going to be applied to professional sports and nursing where blacks and women dominate?  Nope.  Because the goal is not &#8220;evening things out&#8221;.  The goal is wiping the white man out, period. </p>
<p>Careful, if you kick enough white man warriors to the curb, they may decide to start their own army, which will be subsequently much better then the non-meritocracy driven official army that kicked them out. </p>

		<p>Back in the mid-1980&rsquo;s when I took the ASVAB, six out of the 50+ people who took the test with me passed. If memory serves, five out of six or all six were white (in a school that was 75% black). My recruiter (who has since passed away), showed me the scores and shook his head at being stuck with my high school. He even had one high school where not one student in four years passed the ASVAB. </p>
<p>Do you really think that you can find enough women and minorities to run a fleet of nuclear powered subs? On those rare occasions when you see a black officer who is sub qualified, he has earned it. These men are VERY few and far between. Every officer on a sub (except for the supply officer) has graduated from Navy Nuclear Power School. Think of a Masters in Nuclear Engineering crammed into six months. For the enlisted side, they get a lot of the same material, but don&rsquo;t go into the same level of theory. This is more hands on, but there is still a tremendous wash out rate and even the dumbest guy there is in the top 10% of the Navy. </p>
<p>Let the diversity queens staff the military with women and minorities, we&rsquo;ll see how well that works. </p>

		<p>In moments of relative thoughtfulness, some blacks  &mdash;  but more often their white liberal apologists  &mdash;  are fond of asserting that whites achieved world dominance because they are more vicious, aggressive, and bloodthirsty than blacks.</p>
<p>The fallacy in this logic is that whites are just better at EVERYTHING, with the exception perhaps of basketball and short distance sprinting. We get organized, decide what we&rsquo;re going to do, and then kick major backside. We do this whether it&rsquo;s the arts, nationbuilding, educating our kids, or warfare.</p>
<p>Blacks are good at the suckerpunch, or jumping lone, vulnerable white people. If it ever came down to a real day of reckoning, though, a hundred organized whites would make a thousand angry blacks regret the day they ever mouthed off at an authority figure.</p>

		<p>We expect the attention on the lack of needed and enriching diversity in the military to push White Soldiers into our ranks.</p>
<p>The entire notion of diversity is a devaluation of White Soldiery, and given that most come from lower middle class and lower class backgrounds, they are not handicapped by college education and are therefore more prone to operate with God-sanctioned instinct against anti-Whiteness.</p>

		<p>Well, the one thing the PC Nazi&rsquo;s always forget is that women and minorites don&rsquo;t like risk taking assigments in the military like &#8220;Special Forces&#8221;. They would rather sit back in the rear echlon and safely grab their government checks without the worry of catching a bullet for it. Watch any Youtube combat footage in Afghanistan and you will see nothing but white male faces. I live in Las Vegas and I can&rsquo;t walk around without tripping over an Asian, but I see absolutely none of them represented on the frontlines. Which begs  the question one more time, why would a heterosexual white guy join the US military in the first place? This is an institution that fights for a government that is bound and determined to make white guys second class citizens and you are fighting for this? If it weren&rsquo;t for white guys doing the dirty work this institution would fold in a heart beat.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The platoon strikes us as pretty formidable-looking unit, but no doubt the Military Leadership Diversity Commission would say it would be a lot more effective with a stiff dose of blacks, Hispanics and, of course, women.&#8221;</p>
<p>In what way? No argument is actually given to us. Can Anrem actually provide the rest of the article.</p>
<p>If this is what the Military Leadership Diversity Commission believes in it is seriously compounded with falsehoods. First of a fighting force always have to be a cohesive unit. Unlike civilian life where it could be argued that diversity enriches a population, diversity in the army will definitely spell doom.</p>
<p>Women aren&rsquo;t geared towards war; period. There biological makeup isn&rsquo;t the same as men. I respect (most) women but war is the domain of man. A society that sends women off to war, spells doom to that society, because women being killed means less chance of survival. A society can rebound with many more women than men; but, the same can&rsquo;t not said the other way.</p>
<p>While there are homosexuals in the military and don&rsquo;t talk about it, admittedly, most homosexauls are very feminine which isn&rsquo;t suited in warfare. First, I believe homosexuality is by definition a disease. Male homosexuals, in my book, aren&rsquo;t excused. Because I don&rsquo;t think that they should get special privileges while I could be drafted and die. Such idealism should be meet with cold reality and let them have &#8220;equal rights&#8221;  &mdash;  by all means.</p>
<p>@ Texas rebel</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it proves superiority of Anglo-Europeans because many countries across the globe have their own people in special forces. All it shows is that we are a majority white nation and always were.</p>

		<p>Hello all my AMREN brothers and sisters.  I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while but here&rsquo;s my I challenge to our forum: See if you can name any profession whatsoever that benefits from diversity.  When the focus is meeting the PC correct proportion of blacks, other minorities or women in lieu of excellence, that profession will degrade substantially.  Without fail, the standards, be they physical, emotional or intellectual, always have to be lowered in order to inchieve that ever elusive &#8216;strength through diversity&rsquo; we are always hearing about but never ever see.</p>
<p><br>
The world&rsquo;s on fire and a non-White military will more likely fire on a White group&hellip;if you know where I am getting at. </p>

<p>Maybe true, but then again maybe not. I have despaired our declining numbers and influence over the years reading here. Then I thought about something else. Jews are a statistically small percentage of the worlds people, yet they survive, and are often at the very top of Law, medicine, science, media, etc. They are intensely bright, fiercely clannish, and unafraid of the name-calling of the rest of the world. Israel should have been swallowed up years ago, but they continue to better than hold their own, admittedly with US funds and support. </p>
<p>My advice in any racial conflict, when the gloves come off, bet on the white guys. Take another look at these fine men pictured. The best of their kind! A &#8216;diverse&rsquo; military would be required to accept any nonwhites to try  for such positions, yet who gets to the point of the spear, century after century? Men just like these. Each and every one apparently an evil white male! If the military could create a &#8216;diverse&rsquo; platoon even remotely as talented as these men, we would never, never hear the end of their heroic exploits! Is Je$$e Jack$on out there praising the heroes of the 23rd black army rangers?  If one could train 40 black males to work together!  Surely someone must be able to do so&hellip; right?  </p>
<p>I work in a government agency full of diversity. No matter the obvious efforts to keep a diverse workforce, what invariably happens is that the guys who rise to the top, the aggressive ones who step into real physical harm, extra work, training and the possibility of genuine danger are always, always the white males. What are we scared of? No other group can do what WE do!</p>
<p>If and when we whites leave/are cast out by the more numerous other races, I am confident men like these will rise to the top of whatever defense force we create in our own little land. We have the strength, skills, intellect, patience and creativity beyond all others. We need to remind ourselves as such!  </p>

		<p>I guess the question I have is this.  Are the elites willing to put egalitarian ideology above all else, even their own self-interest?  Since the &rsquo;60s and possibly earlier, there has been ample lip-service given to it, but until now no one was foolish enough to destroy the best fighting units by lowering standards.  </p>
<p>Are we seeing the triumph of ideology and delusion?  Or is this a Mugabe moment, akin to where the last productive farmers - whites - were pushed out, consequences be d*mned?  Or more likely, is this questioning irrelevant, a distinction without a difference?</p>

		<p>I bet that when Mark Potok or Amy Goodman or Time Wise look at this photo, they flinch.   A bunch of confidant, armed, white men.  The men in that photo have lived too much and seen too much of the real world ever to swallow the PC garbage peddled by the professional hate-sniffers. </p>
<p>Reminds of a few days ago when my work took me out to the country, so I brought along my evil black rifle and stopped by a shooting range nearby.  It was late afternoon, so lots of men just getting off work and stopping by the range to brush up on their marksmanship. Half the vehicles in the parking lot were pickup trucks, and I didn&rsquo;t see a single Obama bumper sticker. </p>
<p>Just lots of southern white men with guns.  No one would confuse it with a a Hillary campaign stop. </p>
<p>The nightmare for the liberal establishment is that a critical mass of current and former spec-ops guys, southern white men who cherish their independence, dissident right intellectuals and blue-collar working Joes - perhaps informed by American Renaissance - decide to set aside their minor differences long enough to say all at once, &#8220;ENOUGH.&#8221;  Enough lies and double standards, enough immigration, enough anti-white discrimination as reparations for events centuries ago, enough mandatory &#8220;diversity&#8221; re-education for those who object.</p>

When violent black gangs are arrogant enough to believe they are actually intimidating Whites and strut like &#8216;cocks of the walk&rsquo; all over the inner-cities, (and certain Whites are intimidated enough to believe in the myth of black superiority in violence), they are making a very serious mistake.Typically they mistake forebearance for weakness.<br>
 They same goes for the wannabe jihadist Pakistanis in England.</p>

		<p>Pretty much, I think all such units as the above will be integrated by minorities and women in the near future. The whole idea anymore is diversity. The powers that be don&rsquo;t give a hoot about efficiency. It&rsquo;s all about selling and moving inventory now. If they have to really do some soldiering for a special reason, they&rsquo;ll just go private to companies like Blackwater.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re well into Reagan&#8221;s &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; concept now. In the future, there&rsquo;ll be all sorts of robots running around following their guidance systems killing coldly and efficiently.</p>

		<p>I am happy to hear that our 22 year old friend, at #5, thought over carefully his decision to join the Army. </p>
<p>You will do much better for yourself attending College, or better yet, a Trade School for Electrician, Plumber, Carpenter, etc., which are all jobs that cannot be &#8220;outsourced overseas&#8221;. </p>
<p>As far as the Military Diversity Commission is concerned, many challenges were already addressed by a number of Combat Officers before Congress, which spoke against women in combat roles of any kind. </p>
<p>Once again, I must recommend the book, &#8220;An American Knight: The Life of Colonel John Walter Ripley, USMC&#8221; by Norman Fulkerson. </p>
<p>Colonel Ripley&rsquo;s exploits on the Battlefield were covered in great depth, however, his testimony before Congress was empassioned, to prevent our weaker Citizens, our women, from having to endure such terrible hardships, and the possibility of becoming Prisoners of War, with all that entails, if they were placed in combat roles.  </p>
<p>Women in Combat was also addressed in the February issue of the New American magazine. </p>
<p>I recently came across an article from the Council of Conservative Citizens website. It was called, &#8220;A Southerner Speaks&#8221;, by Gene Andrews. </p>
<p>The artilce revealed an open bias and hostility to a young man whom Mr. Andrews knew, when he tried to enlist in the Marine Corps, but was rejected after a preliminary Medical-Physical, when a small Confederate Battle flag tatoo was observed, in an area that would have been covered by a Tee shirt, and certainly, a uniform. </p>
<p>Well, Mr Andrews, who was a former Lieutenant in the Corps, during Vietnam, went down to the Induction Center to follow up on this story, only to learn that it was true, and came directly from Marine Corps Headquarters, which identified the Confederate Battle flag as a &#8220;Hate Symbol&#8221;. </p>
<p>Well, there it is. Instead of the Confederate flag being recognized as an Historic symbol of America&rsquo;s past, and a unique flag recognized the world over as representative of a particular region of America, with its own individual culture, it is ridiculed and labeled as a &#8220;Hate symbol&#8221;. </p>
<p>Southern men reading the article must be very proud of the Nation they are serving, and how they are being treated; as Second class Citizens. </p>
<p>Our Illegal Alien population is treated far better than our Native White men, and especially Native Southern White men; those by far, who are decended from the people that forged the greatest Nation on earth. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve worked the last 18 years as a Special Operations soldier and I can tell you first hand, 99.9% of actual &#8220;operators&#8221; who do the heavy lifting are White. I&rsquo;ve worked all over the world, that&rsquo;s out in the field, not in the A/C with the diversity hires, and every time I get home, the diversity pimps are shoving multiculturalism a little further down everyone&rsquo;s throat. Women and minorities get promoted right past White men and all you can do is take it; if you speak up you&rsquo;re a racist or sexist, your only option is to keep getting shot at for a discount rate while little Suzie and Tyrone stay home and get their &#8220;color-blind love&#8221; on. </p>
<p>After 3 combat tours for this country I can&rsquo;t even post my name next to my opinion on here! I&rsquo;d be out in the street a la Helen Thomas if someone heard me stating what everyone already knows: women and minorities are getting a free ride on the back of the strong White Man!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the bonus, it&rsquo;s White men doing all the dying! We&rsquo;re busting to get underpaid and killed for a country that wishes we would just step aside so everyone else could enjoy the country WE put together. </p>
<p>Our trump card though is that without us pedaling, this bicycle is gonna fall over. I think it&rsquo;s high time the White man start looking out for himself and his own; let the oh-so-capable minorities fend for themselves. </p>

<p>&#8220;#7: For anyone who is familiar with the special forces selection and training process will know that the failure rate is close to 10 to 1. A woman would not survive the first day of the selection process.</p>
<p>Unless she was a Soviet sniper in WWII or a VC sniper like in &ldquo;Full Metal Jacket.&rdquo; A lot of men probably couldn&rsquo;t hang with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am guessing that you are the same &#8220;anonymous&#8221; that posted about women being the best snipers and fighter pilots in the USSR (the world) in WW2.  I effectively debunked it with a factual post.  But I will repost it here.</p>
<p>The women (and many men) who fought on the Eastern Front in WW2 were not required to go through anything like today&rsquo;s special forces training.  Your comments have no real meaning in this context.</p>
<p>As for your &#8220;Full Metal Jacket&#8221; referrence, what that proves is my point throughout; Women, even a child can sit tight and pick off anyone when they are in a defensive position.  On the Eastern Front, when the Soviets went on the offensive, German snipers became more effective.  If German fighter pilot kill rates are any indication, many of the 20 million Russians killed in WW2 would be victims of MALE German snipers.  We have no surviving records of their likely astronomical kill rates.  Also, as far as the female fighter pilots are concerned, they were usually going against German Stuka dive bombers, which were very easy to shoot down.  Attacking an objective is always costlier than defending it, especially if it is a good defensive position.  This is simple military tactical fact.</p>

<p>&hellip;&rdquo;Soviet front-line combatants were women; they made the best snipers and fighter pilots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A WW2 fighter requires quite a bit of muscle to fly, let alone hold still before taking off.</p>
<p>1,000 Russian women served as combat pilots during WW2. Most flew as bombers, the few who became fighter pilots, were not the best, but did become aces before being killed in combat. They flew as fighters late in the war, after most of the experienced Germans were gone. Most air combat went on in the Western front. Soviet air mostly did fighter-bomber work (bombing and strafing). As far as the best snipers, I found that while about 2,000 Russian women were used as snipers in WW2, they succeeded while the USSR was on the defensive. German snipers became more successful once the Russians went on the offensive. Consulting the data I pasted below, it is obvious that Vasily Zaitzev was the best Russian and WW2 sniper. Some sites only use Zaitzev&rsquo;s Stalingrad 224 kills when comparing to Pavlenchenko&rsquo;s 309 wartime kills).</p>
<p>Bodycount? Effect<br>
on the battlefield? Most strategic shot? Longest shot? Many factors go<br>
into the equation.</p>
<p>* The Soviets probably had the finest snipers in WW2, as a group. Vasilli Zaitsev with 224 kills at Stalingrad alone and more than 400 kills in all (some say more than 500) is surely ranked in the top tier. Ludmilla Pavlichenko ranks as the best woman sniper with 309 or<br>
more kills.<br>
* Simo Hayha of Finland is credited with more than 500 kills (by sniper, 200 more with an SMG) during only 100 days, in the Winter War.<br>
* Billy Singh of the Australian Light Horse would be the top WW1 sniper.<br>
* Carlos Hathcock, USMC during Vietnam, is legendary for (among other things) setting a world record (longest range confirmed kill, stood for 40 years), shooting and killing an enemy sniper through the scope and crawling through 1000 yards of heavily defended enemy territory to eliminate a Viet Cong general on one of his first missions.</p>
<p>Actually, the greatest sniper of WW1 is Francis &ldquo;Peggy&rdquo; Pegahmagabow, a Canadian sniper who earned 378 confirmed kills.<br>
(Note that nicknames like &#8220;Peggy&#8221; for a male are common among English men, who like to add a playful affect on nick names of friends whose names lend to the tendancy, &#8220;Jonsie&#8221; is common for Jones for example).</p>

<p>Many of us at this point suspect this and that this may indeed be the reason for the call to &#8220;make the military look more like our DIVERSE society.&#8221;  When they force this into the military, they will be finishing the job of killing the military as an effective fighting force.  We may be heading for computer game type warfare in the future, but however it evolves, the old formula of boots on the ground will always be necessary to have any real effect in securing a victory won by any means.  All military scientists know this.  </p>
<p>IF they are smart enough to realize the probable destruction of these forces through this sort of integration, (unless the point is their present existence as a kill-off program for white males), they will most likely fulfill the desire of the useless aspirants into the officer ranks by further widening the definition of &#8220;COMBAT.&#8221;  I think this is the more likely probability.  We have already seen women claim &#8220;combat duty&#8221; rhetorically because they drive trucks in regions that could see ambushes or IEDs, and a few women have been killed this way in the past ten years.  By attaining a combat designation for this kind of service, they will be politically available for promotion to top leadership positions, which is what this is all about.  When a female is running the entire Afghanistan operation, I guess then we will see how much superior they are at managing a war.  Any female who can survive such a trial in any form, will have considerable political clout as far as a presidential campaign would go, at least lending a &#8220;Commander and Chief&#8221; comeback to critics.  This is much of what this is about, IMO.</p>

I noticed my unit in particular &#8220;fast tracks&#8221; blacks and hispanics to promotion and I even found out that promotion to SFC and Msgt are dictated to an extent based on race. The army makes you take a DA photo to go into your E-7 and E-8 packet so that they don&rsquo;t over promote white males. It&rsquo;s sad but the only thing us good patriotic white men can do is join the elite organizations like the Special Forces and Rangers.

		<p>As a Retired Marine with 22 years service, I can write with some authority on this subject. I spent my entire career in the Infantry Field, with a few instructor or special duty assignments along the way. I did this because I wanted to be a Warrior and not some sort of uniformed technician.</p>
<p>The actual war-fighting part of the U.S. Military is heavily White, especially the Special Ops Community. This unit photo you see in the article is not an anomoly, this is pretty standard. Take a look at a unit picture for a Marine Rifle Company, a Special Forces A-Team, a Navy SEAL Platoon, a Company in a Ranger Battalion, none of these units &#8220;looks like America&#8221;. White men are doing most of the heavy lifting when it comes to fighting this nation&rsquo;s wars. </p>
<p>On the other hand, when you walk into the Unit Personnel Office, Motor Pool, Supply Warehouse, or any of the &#8220;Service and Support&#8221; arms of the Military you will see they are heavily Black and Hispanic. There is a tendency for many minorities to see the military as just a well-armed civil service job, with cool work clothes. As a rule, they aren&rsquo;t there because of any burning desire to be a member of the Profession of Arms, it&rsquo;s all about paycheck, bennies and job security.</p>
<p>You rarely see much minority representation in Scout/Snipers, Recon or Force Recon, the Navy SEAL or Army Ranger or Special Forces communities. These are all volunteer outfits, key word being &#8220;volunteer, you have to suit up and show up first. Just because you show up doesn&rsquo;t make you a part of that outfit, you have to get through the Indoc. Indoc is where they find out who appears to pack the gear they need to make it through training. Most applicants (of all colors) don&rsquo;t make it though Indoc. For those that make it thought Indoc, they still have months of brutally tough training before they are even considered an &#8220;entry level&#8221; Special Operator. </p>
<p>In two of the Rifle Battalions I served in, the Scout/Sniper Platoons that were accused of racism because there were no Black Marines in them. I asked a Scout/Sniper friend of mine what the story was. He shrugged and replied &#8220;The dooor&rsquo;s open for them too, just like anyone else, none of them ever show up to take the Indoc&#8221;. </p>
<p>I was a Recruiter for a couple years. Most enlistees have a good chance of being placed in the field they want to go into, as long as they have the test scores for it. Most people end up in the fields where they want to go. I recruited in Western AR and Eastern OK, this was a heavily White region of the country with some Black and Indian population. I never had a single Black applicant who wanted to go into the Combat Arms fields, they always gravitated toward the Service/Support Fields. Most of the White and a lot of Indian kids I worked with wanted to go into the Warrior side of the business. We we seldom had enough Infantry slots to go around for all the kids that wanted them, some had to settle for Artillery, Tanks, Combat Engineers.</p>
<p>The Corps has never conducted Enlisted Recruiting on a racial quota or gender basis. If a kid walked into our office that was mentally, morally and physically qualified to be a Marine and WANTED to be a Marine, we didn&rsquo;t care if he was the color of a baboon&rsquo;s butt, we put him in. One of the Navy Recruiters gave me White kid one time because the lad wanted to join up, NOW, and the Navy guys couldn&rsquo;t touch him because they hadn&rsquo;t put in Black female for the month. That was my first brush with &#8220;quota&#8221; recruiting. </p>
<p>Officer Recruiting is different, the OSO (Officer Selection Officer) is required to recruit Officer Candidates on a basis of Ethnicity. In short, they want an Officer Corps that &#8220;looks like America&#8221; Here is where where a lot of problems occur, quality-wise. </p>
<p>There are huge numbers of Blond haired, blue eyed, exceptionally fit White boys with high test scores, no Police involvement or drug use history, that are dying to be Marine Officers. The OSO has a large number of exceptionally qualified White applicants to choose from and usually rakes in the best of the bunch when filling his &#8220;White Quotas&#8221;</p>
<p>Recruiting minority Officer Candidates is problematic. With the way the diversity departments of private sector companies are fighting for qualified minorities, few highly qualified minority applicants are showing up on the OSO&rsquo;s doorstep. If the OSO has 3 &#8220;Black Quotas&#8221; for the year, he may get 1 exceptionally well qualified black applicant, and another 2 that barely make the cut. Sometimes the OSO has to really strive to make sure these guys get through the selection process, due to police involvement, drug use or mediocre test scores.</p>
<p>Once everyone becomes a an Officer Candidate and goes to OCS, the quota system ends. We have to recruit them on a quota basis but there is no graduation quota in place. It&rsquo;s on them to meet the standards required to graduate OCS. Black Candidates have had a higher washout rate at OCS than the other ethnicities. I believe that is due to the fact that we aren&rsquo;t getting their best and brightest. If the same high sandards were applied to recruiting Black Candidates as are applied to the White kids, there wouldn&rsquo;t be the Black washout rate we see.</p>
<p>For those that make it through OCS, they have to put in 3 choices for Occupational Fields while they are in TBS (The Basic School). Most of the White Officers joined to be Infantry Officers, or at least in one of the Combat Arms. Typically, Black Officers opt away from the Combat Arms. During my 22 years of service, I worked with very few Black Infantry Officers, and that number wouldn&rsquo;t come close to the 12% of the population they represent. </p>
<p>When I was a Platoon Sergeant, one of my Platoon Commanders told me that when he was in TBS, the School Staff there had to assign Black Officers to the Combat Arms against their wishes because there weren&rsquo;t enough of them applying for these fields. This was a result of them being prodded from upon high to make our Officer Corps &#8220;look like America. Inspite of this practice, there is a dearth of Minority Officers in the Combat Arms Fields.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants the important commands during their career has to come from the Combat Arms. The Corps is not going to assign a Supply Officer to command a Rifle Battalion. A career Data Dink is not going to command a Regiment. An Aviation Maintenence Officer is not going to become Commandant of the Marine Corps. Minority Officers can shy away from combat assignments all they want, but those whose jobs don&rsquo;t include leading Marines in combat are not going to get the important assignments later in their careers. </p>

		<p>A lot of people are posting comments that state that white men are stupid for joining the military. While it is obvious that the government hates us, it is also true that the positions in the military that require real talent, intelligence, honor, courage and commitment are overwelmingly occupied by white males. Minorities are placed on the sidelines due to a lack of these qualities. White males joining the military today do so for many different reasons. One of those reasons is to fight for what they believe to be their country. If those with all the talent, courage, and guns believe it is their country and their military then I agree. Many of these men have already joined the oathkeepers as a testament to their loyalty to their country. I wish all of our white male servicemen well in all of their endeavors.</p>

		<p>And if a group of whites decided it was in their best interest to leave the US and form their own country, would you think so highly of these men after they followed their employer&rsquo;s demand to &#8220;preserve the union&#8221; at any cost?</p>
<p>Although there are race realists in the armed forces, and in an elite unit such as this are probably at higher numbers than the forces as a whole, I fear that too many Amreners fail to grasp a very key point.  Our government is opposed to us, if not outright our enemies, and the armed forces are the muscle behind that government.  They are not separate from it.  Most of them will do its bidding when the chips are down.</p>
<p>There is no doubt the minorities and feminists in the armed forces won&rsquo;t think twice about shooting you down in the street if you oppose the government.  My fear is that when their families are hungry and murdering for Uncle Sam is their only employment prospect, our warriors will choose their stomachs over their principles and turn their weapons on us.</p>
<p>If you think I&rsquo;m crazy look up the Bonus Army.  And those were white soldiers and their own white brothers-in-arms they rolled tanks on, gassed and charged with bayonets.  It&rsquo;s happened before and there&rsquo;s no reason it can&rsquo;t happen again.</p>

<p>I think there are a lot that White women can do, in the army. I&rsquo;m not sure about the Hispanics, though. I mean, if they prefer to live in the US speaking Spanish, and wave their own flags, instead of the Stars and Stripes, etc, what does that tend to say, about their loyalty to the US?</p>
<p>Today, America wins relatively easy battles against Allah-crazy desert dwellers, using vastly superior technology. What will happen, if some day, the US is faced with an enemy, possessing equal (or superior!) technology, and the forces of America, are full of Mexican Mestizos, possibly not willing to fight and die for America anyway?</p>

		<p>i am a veteren and what i say while i was in the navy is that the majority of vlaks/latins and other &#8220;diverse&#8221; people tended to be in a job that was easier I.E ; paperwork jobs(and they still jacked it up),postal work,annd various other &#8220;mindless&#8221; work while my non-diverse did actual work that included a thought process.</p>

		<p>As a woman, and as someone whose skin color is about midway between that of the white Marines and the brown interpreters (yes, I&rsquo;m white. Mediterranean/southern European ancestry), I&rsquo;d just like to say that I love this picture. I feel safe with these guys watching our country&rsquo;s back, rather than DeMarcus, Shaniqua, Pedro, Xochitl, or even Sierra, MacKenzie, and Taylor.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m no traditionalist. I work in a male-dominated profession, don&rsquo;t own any pearls, but do own several firearms. I don&rsquo;t have much in common with June Cleaver. But I do recognize this powerful thing called reality. And reality states that any merit-based Special Forces unit will be virtually all white male because women lack the required physical strength and blacks and browns lack the required intelligence and determination. It&rsquo;s nothing for anyone to be ashamed of; there&rsquo;s no shame in acknowledging the truth. It&rsquo;s people with huge egos, and/or those who constantly feel the need to &#8220;prove&#8221; themselves to everybody and everything, who have a problem with it.</p>
<p>But there are also problems with people who take things too far in the other direction. The idea that is commonly known as &#8220;feminism&#8221; - that is, the leftist, angry-woman school of thought - is just another tool used by the Bolsheviks to divide and weaken whites. That means it&rsquo;s a bad thing, but it also means that feminists are not The Big Bad Villain(ess)es In Charge Of All. They are merely pawns of the true villains - the Communists/Multiculturalists. Those Bolsheviks&rsquo; goal is to turn white men and white women against each other, and both militant feminists and militant anti-feminists are suckers who have fallen for their lies. Any white man who &#8220;bonds&#8221; with a black man for the purpose of bashing women is just as much a traitor as a liberal white woman who joins &#8220;da sistahs of colah&#8221; in bashing white males.</p>

		<p>Nice photo to look at - refreshing and inspiring in fact. Hearkens one back to images of soldiers from the American Civil War, the two World Wars, and to a certain extent Vietnam. Hopefully the face of the American and Western armed forces will look that way for good.</p>

<p>Hello Gunny, Interesting read. In my time in the Corps, there were no black oficers. What I want to know is, do they still have the swimming requirement in place for officers? If so, wouldn&rsquo;t that disqualify the vast majority of black applicants from passing OCS?</p>
<p>My last duty station in the Corps before getting out was Quantico and I was an instrutor in comm gear and procedure for the officer candidates. The final exam at that time was a torturous 50 mile forced march with full combat gear (minus ammo). Do they still have that? Not many blacks have it in them to do something like that.</p>

		<p>Hi all. I&rsquo;m a 30 year old White female. When I was fresh out of high school, I thought long and hard about joining the military. In part, this was because I had my high school&rsquo;s highest score on the ASVAB - and this was in a high school that was 60% White! I&rsquo;m also not ashamed to say that I&rsquo;m still in great physical shape and can do more pull-ups than some guys I know.</p>
<p>Anyway, I became a high school history teacher instead because I decided I could have a greater influence on this country by teaching young people the truth about Western culture and our wonderful American exceptionalism.</p>
<p>I agree with all of you old-school gentlemen that forcing our military to become &#8220;diverse&#8221; will prove a weakness if it means letting women and minorities slide in with lower standards. Now, I can&rsquo;t speak for ethnic minorities, but give the women a chance! Make &#8216;em shave their head, ditch the makeup, and meet the exact same standards the men do. I guarantee you&rsquo;ll get A LOT fewer women willing and able to serve, but the ones you&rsquo;ll get will be some bad-a$$ Amazon types who can hold their own with the guys.<br>

		<p>One must conclude that white combat soldiers are being used, meanwhile the Military Leadership is infused with PC nonsense that works against their  interest.  True equality and combat service and merit are / will be totally or increasingly ignored by the US Political / Military Leadership. </p>
<p>What are our choices going forward?</p>

		<p>I agree 100% with what USMC Gunny said. I&rsquo;m currently serving in a Combat Service Support unit overseas, and I can tell you that the minorities are the majority. 80% of my unit is black. Coincidentally, my unit also has the highest rate of STDs, DUIs, rape, divorces, chapters (meaning: getting thrown out of the Army) in theater. Service support provides logistical support to the hard-charging hooahs who do what it takes, and one of these days those hooahs are going to wake up and find their supply lines cut because a vast majority of the people supporting them are barely qualified to justify existing, much less serving among &#8220;America&rsquo;s finest&#8221;. Reverse racism abounds. Gang-like activity is the norm. Whites at all levels turn a blind eye because speaking out is a death sentence to their careers. Many of the black females know the system well; they get pregnant, then accuse a high ranking white of racism or sexual harassment (effectively guaranteeing at least 6 months of pay while CID works the case), then get transferred to another unit to start the whole thing over again. Eventually, these black females find a sympathetic command sergeant major who &#8220;takes them under their wing&#8221; to ensure their care (never mind they don&rsquo;t have family care plans and that a lack of one as a single parent soldier is grounds for immediate chapter) and they ride the system, pushing out babies every year or so to ensure more COLA every paycheck. Out of a platoon of 80% black, 20% white, you might get some work done, but the blacks will take credit for it, promote themselves and do everything in their power to step on the whites that work the hardest. Any white American who thinks diversity at any level will work is completely out of touch with reality. Blacks, like Muslims, seek to overthrow and destroy White America.</p>

<p>Tom, when I was in 1979-2003 (2 year break in service), I served with a few Black Infantry Officers. The good ones were exemplary, the not so good seemed like diversity hires. I saw a Black Company Commander relieved just before we jumped off into combat because all of his Platoon Commanders went to the Battalion Commander and said they didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable going into combat with him. </p>
<p>As far as I know, passing swim qual is still as much a manadatory requirement as qualifying with your T/O weapon. All hands have to pass it in Boot Camp and OCS. That does eliminate many Blacks. I was a Platoon Sergeant in a Raid Company for a couple years. Being at least a 2nd Class swimmer was required to even get through the door. I don&rsquo;t think there were 5 blacks in the Company my whole time there, and 2 of them were Staff NCO&rsquo;s.  </p>

		<p>TO POSTER #50, ANONYMOUS (30yr old white female): Welcome! I&rsquo;m one of those &#8220;old gentlemen&#8221; you referred to. I agree with much of your post and want to congratulate you on becoming a history teacher, which I believe is the single most important type of job anyone can have in education.  I oppose women in combat units for traditional cultural reasons as well as reasons of national security. But you are right in thinking a few women out there could indeed pass all the tests &amp; perform well in combat. And, unlike me, most young male combat arms soldiers I know are willing to accept such amazons into their ranks. But they also believe that the mania for &#8220;diversity&#8221; will cause standards to be lowered so that a politically correct number of women - many more than can meet &#8220;male standards&#8221; - will be forced upon the combat units.</p>

		<p>@ Strider (#37) - You&rsquo;re not quite correct about Ron Howard not &#8220;diversifying&#8221; the Apollo 13 characters.  As I watched the movie I remember thinking how refreshing it was that they had&rsquo;t tried to fool the audience (as they invariably do) into believing that blacks had played any part in the original drama and, as far as the crew in Mission Control goes, it was historically accurate.  </p>
<p>However, towards the end of the movie, I distinctly recall the appearance in one outside scene of a black &#8220;General&#8221; dressed in a full-length Gestapo-style black leather coat. There didn&rsquo;t seem to be any purpose him being in the movie aside from trying to hoodwink the audience into believing that a black man played an important role in the actual 1970 events.  </p>
<p>However I just looked at the cast-list here&hellip;. http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800020307/cast<br>
and I cant find any reference to a &#8220;General&#8221; but perhaps someone who knows movie actors better than I do can find the name of a black actor amongst them.  I think the black was a well-known one playing a &#8220;cameo&#8221; role. </p>
