<h1>Italy Facing Immigration Emergency</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frank Jordans, Google News, March 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Italy is facing a humanitarian and sanitation crisis on the tiny island of Lampedusa following the arrival of some 15,000 Tunisian boat people amid fears more migrants will flee there following coalition airstrikes on Libya.</p>
<p>Lampedusa is currently housing some 4,800 Tunisians, almost doubling the island&rsquo;s population of 5,000 and putting a severe strain on its immigrant holding center which has a capacity of just 850.</p>
<p>Italy had been ferrying and airlifting the migrants off the island to be processed at holding centers elsewhere. But those centers are now full, leading to a backlog in Lampedusa  &mdash;  the primary point of arrival for North Africans due to its close proximity to Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said measures would be taken in coming days to stem the flow and ease the burden on Lampedusa, including a visit to Tunis Wednesday to press for a resumption of the immigration treaty agreements and border controls that evaporated after the country&rsquo;s popular revolt in January.</p>
<p>He said 25 Tunisians had arrived in Lampedusa in 2010  &mdash;  &#8220;Now, 14,000 have arrived in two months.&#8221; Maroni added that an Italian navy ship would be sent to the island to transport migrants to holding centers elsewhere in Italy, and he would be meeting with regional officials to find additional centers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Maroni told a news conference Monday that some 200 Libyans from the country&rsquo;s east had arrived overnight in Catania, Sicily, marking the first major influx from Libya to Italy since the revolt against Moammar Gadhafi began over a month ago.</p>
<p>But it appeared his information was outdated. Officials from Catania&rsquo;s port, police, carabinieri and financial police said the migrants were Egyptians, not Libyans  &mdash;  news reports indicating they claimed to be Libyans to obtain refugee status.</p>
<p>Italy has been sending back the vast majority of the 14,918 Tunisians and Egyptians who have arrived at its borders in recent weeks following popular revolts in their home countries, saying they don&rsquo;t qualify for asylum or refugee status as there are no wars or humanitarian crises in their countries.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Italy has demanded Europe help with the flow of immigrants, saying it shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to cope alone. It has argued that its active cooperation in the Libya military campaign should compel European partners to share the burden and take some of the immigrants off its hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to use this authority that our participation in this operation gives us to ask all the states to share with us the cost of the immigrant flows,&#8221; Maroni said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The anti-immigrant Northern League, a key government partner which has been at the forefront of demands that the EU take in some of the Lampedusa immigrants, submitted a proposal to parliament Monday demanding the European Union take responsibility.</p>

		<p>According to the media the Egyptians and Tunisians are all ecstatic at having won their freedom. They should all be racing home now to partake of the great new society they are building. On a side note, when do the Libyan &#8220;refugees&#8221; start making their way here? </p>

<p>They&rsquo;re absolute fools if they don&rsquo;t send them back, and they deserve all the problems that will result in accepting these parsites into their communities, if they feel compelled to allow them to stay.<br>

		<p>Italians must have become lazy and don&rsquo;t want to work anymore. So they are importing vast numbers of North Africans who want to work and put food on the table for their families. That must be what it is. Of course. How could anyone think otherwise. The North Africans will just do the work Italians don&rsquo;t want to do anymore. Sure! It is so simple. Think of all the wonderful diversity. And you will be able to go to a different North African restaurant once a week every week. How nice.</p>

		<p>The authorities don&rsquo;t seem to know what to do. I&rsquo;ll help out. You don&rsquo;t want them. When they enter your land, take them back to their own land. If it happens again and again, get nasty to frighten them away. Get as nasty as it takes. Works everytime. </p>

		<p>Europe is drowning in a Tsunami of invaders from Africa and Asia. This demographic &ldquo;change&rdquo; is occurring at the behest and supervision of the masters of politics and control. <br>
Nothing in the life happens by chance. The invasion is the insane result of mistaken perhaps even evil planning and in the end will mean the destruction of the people and culture of Europe as we have known it. <br>
The fools / offenders who are making all this possible will perhaps at some point regret their misconceptions and stupid course of action but by then it will be too late.<br>

		<p>My pity for the Italians is somewhat limited. It has for decades been their policy to simply process the arrivals and transport them to the Austrian border. Let those stupid potato-eaters deal with them. You see, it´s much cheaper and smoother that way.<br>
Not that the Spanish were better - except they let them work for one season in the tomato and paprika fields before sending them on.</p>
<p>- But I see the situation is getting out of hand. Sooner or later there will have to be a European solution i.e. turning the Mediterranean into the Moat of Fortress Europe. Alas, I see but the barest beginnings of political will so far.</p>

That&rsquo;s not exactly accurate.<br>
The Italian government does not ship clandestines to the Austrian border - they are sadly too good-willed to do so. However, Schenghen regulations allows people to freely circulate around Europe, so once an illegal is in Italy, he can go to Austria without any problem, legally. It&rsquo;s not the Italian government &#8220;dumping&#8221; them.</p>
<p>At any rate, I&rsquo;d like to add (for everyone) that according to the Interior Ministry, there are currently more Arabs in Lampedusa than there are Italian. Matt referred to The Camp of the Saints - you betcha. </p>
<p>This is also why Italy essentially delayed in participating against Libyan strikes. Italy signed extensive oil deals with Libya and offered them a $5 billion package, which included a promise from Libya to stop illegals from heading toward Italy - which worked, the illegals stopped coming almost overnight.</p>
<p>I miss Gheddafi.</p>

		<p>I can think of a better use for an Italian navy ship in this situation, than to &#8220;transport migrants to holding centers elsewhere in Italy.&#8221; It could be used to discourage the migrants from coming to Lampedusa in the first place. <br>

		<p>#12 Dario, Nokangaroos refer to the pre-schengen time when the italians did exactly that. Send em north and forget about them and forget about doing anything about the people smuggling networks. That strategy sort of backfired in the long term becasue the people smugglers arent going to stop ferrying people into Italy merely because Italy no longer can send people north and forget about them. Italy is now the 1st arrival nation on EU territory and therefore 1st asylum application nation, and the northern euros are therefore going to send the asylants back to Italy and asylum processing. </p>
<p>And someone without a valid residence permit in an EU nation cant move along freely inside the schengen system, hes an illegal everywhere. </p>
<p>The americans are pursuing an identical strategy when they refuse to do something about their inflow of mexicans and the drug cartels that come in with them. In 10-15 years you will see decapitated american corpses on american streets when the drug wars come to america and american police departments and county sheriffs have to bow or be obliterated. But ignoring them and kicking the can down the road works right now.  </p>
