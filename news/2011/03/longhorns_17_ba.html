	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Case in point: Paul Krugman. The Times&rsquo; staff economics blowhard recently typed, re the state of education in Texas:</p>
<p>And in low-tax, low-spending Texas, the kids are not all right. The high school graduation rate, at just 61.3 percent, puts Texas 43rd out of 50 in state rankings. Nationally, the state ranks fifth in child poverty; it leads in the percentage of children without health insurance. And only 78 percent of Texas children are in excellent or very good health, significantly below the national average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a son of Iowa, I&rsquo;m no stranger to bragging about my home state&rsquo;s ranking on various standardized test. Like Wisconsin we Iowans usually rank near the top of the heap on average ACT/SAT scores. We are usually joined there by Minnesota, Nebraska, and the various Dakotas; Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p> &hellip;   beginning to see a pattern? Perhaps because a state&rsquo;s &#8220;average ACT/SAT&#8221; is, for all intents and purposes, a proxy for the percent of white people who live there. In fact, the lion&rsquo;s share of state-to-state variance in test scores is accounted for by differences in ethnic composition. Minority students  &mdash;  regardless of state residence  &mdash;  tend to score lower than white students on standardized test, and the higher the proportion of minority students in a state the lower its overall test scores tend to be.</p>
<p>Please note: this has nothing to do with innate ability or aptitude. Quite to the contrary, I believe the test gap between minority students and white students can be attributed to differences in socioeconomic status. And poverty. And yes, racism. And yes, family structure. Whatever combination of reasons, the gap exists, and it&rsquo;s mathematical sophistry to compare the combined average test scores in a state like Wisconsin (4% black, 4% Hispanic) with a state like Texas (12% black, 30% Hispanic).</p>
<p>So how to compare educational achievement between two states with such dissimilar populations? In data analysis this is usually done by treating ethnicity as a &#8220;covariate.&#8221; A very simple way to do this is by comparing educational achievement between states within the same ethnic group. In other words, do black students perform better in Wisconsin than Texas? Do Hispanic students perform better in Wisconsin or Texas? White students? If Wisconsin&rsquo;s kids consistently beat their Texas counterparts, after controlling for ethnicity, then there&rsquo;s a strong case that maybe Texas schools ought to become a union shop.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is data to answer this question via the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP is an annual standardized test given to 4th and 8th graders around the country to measure proficiency in math, science, and reading. Participation is fairly universal; if you&rsquo;ve had a 4th or 8th grader in the last few years, you&rsquo;re probably familiar with it. Results are compiled on the NAEP website, broken down by grade, state, subject and ethnicity.</p>
<p>So how does brokeass, dumbass, redneck Texas stack up against progressive unionized Wisconsin?</p>
<p><b>2009 4th Grade Math</b><br>
White students: Texas 254, Wisconsin 250 (national average 248)<br>
Black students: Texas 231, Wisconsin 217 (national 222)<br>
Hispanic students: Texas 233, Wisconsin 228 (national 227)</p>
<p><b>2009 8th Grade Math</b><br>
White students: Texas 301, Wisconsin 294 (national 294)<br>
Black students: Texas 272, Wisconsin 254 (national 260)<br>
Hispanic students: Texas 277, Wisconsin 268 (national 260)</p>
<p><b>2009 4th Grade Reading</b><br>
White students: Texas 232, Wisconsin 227 (national 229)<br>
Black students: Texas 213, Wisconsin 192 (national 204)<br>
Hispanic students: Texas 210, Wisconsin 202 (national 204)</p>
<p><b>2009 8th Grade Reading</b><br>
White students: Texas 273, Wisconsin 271 (national 271)<br>
Black students: Texas 249, Wisconsin 238 (national 245)<br>
Hispanic students: Texas 251, Wisconsin 250 (national 248)</p>
<p><b>2009 4th Grade Science</b><br>
White students: Texas 168, Wisconsin 164 (national 162)<br>
Black students: Texas 139, Wisconsin 121 (national 127)<br>
Hispanic students: Wisconsin 138, Texas 136 (national 130)</p>
<p><b>2009 8th Grade Science</b><br>
White students: Texas 167, Wisconsin 165 (national 161)<br>
Black students: Texas 133, Wisconsin 120 (national 125)<br>
Hispanic students: Texas 141, Wisconsin 134 (national 131)</p>
<p>To recap: white students in Texas perform better than white students in Wisconsin, black students in Texas perform better than black students in Wisconsin, Hispanic students in Texas perform better than Hispanic students in Wisconsin. In 18 separate ethnicity-controlled comparisons, the only one where Wisconsin students performed better than their peers in Texas was 4th grade science for Hispanic students (statistically insignificant), and this was reversed by 8th grade. Further, Texas students exceeded the national average for their ethnic cohort in all 18 comparisons; Wisconsinites were below the national average in 8, above average in 8.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking thing in these numbers is the within-state gap between white and minority students. Not only did white Texas students outperform white Wisconsin students, the gap between white students and minority students in Texas was much less than the gap between white and minority students in Wisconsin. In other words, students are better off in Texas schools than in Wisconsin schools  &mdash;  especially minority students.</p>

		<p>While anyone with a brain would disagree the mantra that difference between black and white scores will narrow (they haven&rsquo;t for decades), I&rsquo;m glad someone recognizes the fact race matters when determining test scores.  </p>
<p>In fact, not appreciating the role genetics has on a child&rsquo;s ability to score well on standardized tests is a major problem with the educational system.  Too often we here the problem is with money, the teachers, the unions, the curriculum, etc. but never is the intelligence of the kids questioned.  This isn&rsquo;t to say many teachers&rsquo; unions aren&rsquo;t greedy, thuggish crybabies - -they are.  But one cannot argue they are the sole cause for &#8220;poor test scores&#8221; from sea to shining sea.  If our immigrants were Western Europeans instead of Northern Mexicans, I&rsquo;d tell the teacher&rsquo;s to collectively bargain to their hearts content.</p>
<p>The fact that Texas does slightly better (when divided by race) than Wisconsin isn&rsquo;t surprising.  The small differences can be traced to the fact Texans have a conservative, hard-working mindset whereas Wisconsin is a liberal, entitlement-driven society.  The optimal model for education isn&rsquo;t something magical, but it requires hard work and determination daily on the part of teachers, principals, students and parents all.  Texas values these things more than Wisconsin.  </p>
<p>In fact, as Pat Buchanan mentioned last December, the US does better (when divided out by race) than other nations, i.e. white Americans do better than white Europeans, American Chinese do better than Shanghai Chinese, and American hispanics do better than their Mexican hispanics.  I would argue, for its flaws, the US has a better value system than these countries, and our wealth has helped build a solid educational system.  The fact we have millions of immigrants and minorities drive down test scores, but it doesn&rsquo;t change the truthful measures of academic achievement.</p>

		<p>I suppose the boilerplate about socioeconomics and racism is derigeur. Still, just putting out the stats is enough to tell racial the truth, albeit with a wink and nod. I do wish he had included longitudinal references, though. The utter stability of racial gaps in achievement over time is the most damning indictment of the entire liberal scheme for racial progress.</p>

		<p>What Paul Krugman doesn&rsquo;t take into account is that Texas has large numbers of illegals from Mexico who have a high dropout rates and who do poorly in school. Wisconsin or Iowa does not, hence the difference. Comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges. Also, if Iowa or Wisconsin had the same number of illegals and their heavy use of public welfare as Texas, they would go broke with the same tax scales they use.</p>

		<p>As I received a shoddy public school education in Texas, myself, I shudder to imagine what ignorance lurks in populations which rank below Texas.</p>
<p>The problem with public education is that is geared to the lowest common denominator.  Certainly there are gifted programs and honors programs, but that is for 5-10% of the students at best.  The remaining 90% should be divided into &#8220;average&#8221; and &#8220;better-learn-a-trade.&#8221;  The latter should include no preparatory education at all but instead should focus only on trades such as autoshop, masonry, framing, woodcrafts, drywall, custodial arts, etc. </p>
<p>The public highschools are modeled from preparatory academies which prepare every student for college.  Newsflash: Not even in a homogenous society such as Denmark is *every* child college material.  What do we do with the bottom 50%?  Currently our only plan is to lie to them until they drop out or fail out and embark on a lifelong affair with crime.  They need a trade.</p>
<p>I personally believe a job in the trades is more valuable to society than whatever sales job the average bachelor&rsquo;s degree is beckoning, anyhow.</p>
<p>My plan would save the bottom 50% from drifting about in their twenties, confused from the lies they were told about &#8220;college&#8221; and &#8220;opportunity.&#8221;</p>

I doubt there many people of any political persuasion or race who genuinely believe this. It is disgusting enough when liberals lie about innate racial differences, but when a conservative lies it is really stomach churning. </p>

 <br>
A high drop out rate indicates that high standards are insisted upon. Students without the intelligence or motivation to meet those standards keep failing, and stop trying.<br>
 <br>
When students are intelligent and motivated large investments are not necessary for them. <br>
 <br>
When students are stupid and disruptive marble sinks in the restrooms, brass doorknobs, and field trips to Europe will not turn them into scholars. </p>

		<p>Iowahawk is a neocon fellow traveller, he is the furthest thing from being pro-white.</p>
<p>Texas has been attracting well educated people from all over the country to work in oil, finance etc. for decades, which has no doubt raised white test scores.  The black population of WI are mostly welfare cases from Chicago, hence the black scores are the only ones where there is a major difference between the two states.</p>

		<p>Another issue is that &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; isn&rsquo;t a race. &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;,although widely <i>used</i> to denote race,isn&rsquo;t a very good term. Quite a few people that I&rsquo;ve worked with over the years have been &#8220;Hispanic&#8221;,if one means that Spanish is their birth language,or if they come from a family that historically spoke Spanish.</p>
<p>Thing is,quite a few of these people have either been White,or so close to being White that if they stayed out of the sun for a few weeks and practiced their drawl,they could very easily pass what&rsquo;s known as the 30-second test. ( i.e.,if you can&rsquo;t tell that they aren&rsquo;t white after talking with them for around 30 seconds,you can safely assume that they&rsquo;re White.)</p>
<p>A great many people fail to realize that plenty of Mexicans are white. This failure is perfectly understandable,because the White Mexicans make up the middle and upper classes of Mexico. The engineers,accountants,bank managers,telecom executives,and the like in Mexico are-as they are here-White. You don&rsquo;t see these folks wading across a river to get here because there&rsquo;s no reason for them to do it-they&rsquo;re doing just fine where they are.</p>
<p>What <i>should</i> be added as racial classifications are the categories of &#8220;Mestizo&#8221; ( mixed blood-white,native,and whatever else managed to sneak out of the woodpile),and &#8220;Indio&#8221;-pure or almost pure Indian (what our Canadian neighbors refer to as &#8220;First Nations&#8221;).</p>

========================</p>
<p>I think he should have phrased it &#8220;this doesn&rsquo;t NECESSARILY have anything to do with innate ability or aptitude&#8221;.  </p>
<p>It may be a matter of CULTURE: of what is considered important in a given household; of what ideals the family holds, what expectations and goals they have, and whether or not they can visualize the individual, incremental steps necessary to achieve a particular goal.  </p>
<p>If a kid is raised in a situation where the caretaker&rsquo;s focus through the work-week is to earn enough booze money to stay drunk the whole weekend, that kid isn&rsquo;t likely to grow up seeing education as a way to escape the ghetto.  He&rsquo;s got no experience of such a thing; the idea is alien to him.  His culture has put blinders on him.  </p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have a way of erasing an unsuccessful culture&rsquo;s &#8220;programming&#8221;, and we don&rsquo;t have a reliable way of replacing anyone&rsquo;s &#8220;cultural beliefs and practices&#8221; with what one might consider &#8220;mainstream American values&#8221;.  (And besides, even if we could, the Loony Lefties would be shrieking that we have NO RIGHT to assume that our Judeo-Christian values are any better than those of, say, some African tribe which believes it&rsquo;s normal and proper to ambush a neighboring tribe in order to get slaves to sell.)  So how DO we get rid of &#8220;failed-culture enclaves&#8221; in the US?   I&rsquo;m pretty sure we have to stop subsidizing illegitimacy and unemployment   &mdash;   but I can&rsquo;t think of a single politician who&rsquo;s willing to suggest such a thing&hellip;</p>

		<p>To Mr. Burge: </p>
<p>I wonder if by &#8220;racism&#8221; you he mean the Afrocentrism that is inculcated into black students by schools, textbooks, and popular culture.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising that blacks who are taught to play the role of victim and to have an entitlement mentality tend to have bad attitudes about working hard and taking personal responsibility.  </p>
<p>Since there is immense social pressure on blacks to be ethnocentric, those blacks who focus on math, science, literature or other &ldquo;white�? subjects are often marginalized.  Ending Black History Month, abolishing African-American Studies programs, and encouraging blacks to study and master real subjects just as whites are would help end the racism that you believe is hampering black academic achievement, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t include any data about Asians.  Does racism have anything to do with the fact that Oriental minority students tend to score even higher than whites?  I doubt it.  The notion of racism holding back Hispanic students is even less likely, since Hispanic isn&rsquo;t even a race per se (a Hispanic can be partly, mostly, or completely white, brown, or black).</p>
<p>As for poverty, I&rsquo;d want to see how blacks from poor families compare with blacks from middle-upper income families, how poor blacks compare with poor whites, etc. before concluding as you do that socioeconomic status is the primary determinant of academic performance.  Presumably, you have examined such comparisons that isolate poverty as a factor but just didn&rsquo;t have room to present your findings in your article.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m most curious as to how you were able to rule out innate ability as even being one among the many factors that explain why test scores diverge consistently along the same racial lines.  Have you found proof that average mental capacity is 100% identical physiologically among all races of the world?  Such that not even a fraction of the percentage of black underperformance, for example, could possibly be a natural outcome that is not anyone&rsquo;s fault and that cannot be changed through cultural, social, philosophical, or political means?</p>

		<p>On education from my reading today at daybreak:  &#8220;And portents these, thought Appleby, of a society running down in another sense; clogged by its own mass-production of indivduals who, let loose from a day&rsquo;s or a lifetime&rsquo;s specialized routine, will neither think nor read nor practise any craft, but only gape.  Hence an unstable world(.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Several pages later, a writer of ad copy considers her profession:  &#8220;But you can&rsquo;t sell soap and toothpaste without knowing that people in general are sub-adult.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s just in our time  &mdash;  a sort of progressive dotage.  That&rsquo;s what I thought when I was doing Woman&rsquo;s-page before I got the copy-writing.  The average mental age seemed to drop every week.  In fact, we had a rule.  If a thing was just too steep to put over  &mdash;  too unfathomably childish and imbecile  &mdash;  we simply put it in a drawer for a month or six weeks.  Then folk were ripe for it.  I suppose that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called history.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree with you 100%. Regardless of race, college is not for everyone. Personally I think very highly of skilled workers, especially masons, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, machinists, and others.</p>
<p>We need to dignify skilled work far more than we do. I&rsquo;m not talking about promoting unions, I&rsquo;m talking about people who can build, repair or create things. Those are the people we need more of.</p>
