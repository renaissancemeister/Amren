			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Marti Oakley, PPJ Gazette, March 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Whatever the Southern Poverty Law (Lie) Center may have done in the past that would have merited respect has long since gone the way of most organizations that lose their way when they are suddenly treated as if they actually still retain any value. This organization that makes its living reviving McCarthyism with all the paranoia and viciousness it can muster is a blight on America. It is my belief that we need to compile our own list of threats to America, and SPLC would top that list.</p>
<p>Until a few years back, I was a registered Democrat and had been all my adult life. I left that party along with any other political affiliation due to the corruption in government at the hands of politicians who did and still do violate our Constitution and our rights while they wage phony wars for profit and who will sell us out to the highest corporate bidder. {snip}</p>
<p>It is apparent that the only &#8220;research&#8221; done to compile their lists is on the net. Anyone (like me) who points out the corruption of the government, who questions their authority to violate and abrogate our rights, who publicly expresses their disgust with the loss of our sovereignty due to illegal trade agreements (which are NOT treaty&rsquo;s as prescribed by the constitution), the selling off of our infrastructure to foreign interests, anyone who realizes that Muslims can&rsquo;t be the international threat the government claims they are or they wouldn&rsquo;t continue to allow millions to emigrate to the US (would they?) that Homeland Security exists for no other reason than to protect the government from us.</p>
<p>If we believe that our right to own property free of government encumbrance, to engage in lawful business activity free of laws protecting corporations and most especially if we believe that with our economy in shambles and 22 million legal Americans unable to find work that our borders should be secured and illegal residents deported back to their homeland&hellip;&hellip;well, we must all be &#8220;hate groups, nativists, ring-wing extremists,&#8221; and whatever other fear mongering tags they can come up with to identify those of us who object to the deconstructing of America.</p>
<p>Well, I lean more to the left, don&rsquo;t own a gun, don&rsquo;t belong to any groups and have absolutely no idea why being a &#8220;nativist&#8221; meaning, a patriotic American citizen, is a bad thing unless of course you are a member of SPLC and then you are fearful and suspicious of anyone who isn&rsquo;t you.</p>
<p>With no other evidence other than what could be located on the net (being far too afraid to actually venture out into the real world) SPLC compiled its lists. {snip} And who, after learning of McCarthyism and the wholesale destruction of lives all premised on red-baiting and the paranoid delusions of Joseph McCarthy thought we would ever have to tolerate this kind of insipid and insidious blacklisting and targeting today only now being practiced by SPLC?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The SPLC serves a purpose. It creates fictional targets, people and groups we are supposed to be afraid of while the real threat that lies in our government continues to grow. The SPLC creates the diversion; that&rsquo;s what the government pays them to do. It is unfortunate that there are those who help fund this anti-American organization that sells hate for profit and who receives copious amounts of grant money and private contributions to do it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While the SPLC is desperate to paint patriot groups and anyone else they are in mortal fear of, as extremists and threats, the general discontent of the nation grows and with it the uneasiness of knowing that the greatest threat we face is not from some unnamed and unidentifiable terrorist in a cave on the other side of the world, but is one that emanates from within.</p>
<p>It is of no comfort to acknowledge that in every generation in every society exists groups of individuals who will turn on the general population for reasons the rest of us will never understand. The SPLC is such a group. Whether it was money, power, recognition .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever the cause, this is an organization that is so un-American, so antithetical to what we believe we are as a nation and what we stand for that one can only wonder how they survive their own shame at being such tools for oppression.<br>

<p>This is a common meme in discussion about the SPLC and the rest of the paranoia-industrial complex that presents itself when either:  (A) left-wing writers come out against the SPLC et al., and (B) neo-conservative or lamestream conservative or pseudo-conservative writers get their panties in a bunch whenever the SPLC starts targeting groups too close to their neck of the woods.  &#8220;The SPLC *used* to be good and honorable and served a good purpose, but&hellip;&#8221; yadda yadda.</p>
<p>What they&rsquo;re saying is that it was just fine with them when the SPLC was lying and distorting about the people who wear those funny white uniforms, or funny other kinds of uniforms, (in order to peddle fear to raise money), because lying about K-people and those other kinds of people &#8220;serves a good purpose.&#8221;  As if K-people aren&rsquo;t really human, and have not civil liberties or civil rights, or human rights, such that it&rsquo;s okay to lie about them to raise money.  It&rsquo;s only when the SPLC starts lying about lamestream conservatives that the lamers get all worked up and worried that the SPLC is &#8220;lying.&#8221;  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called Karma, look it up.</p>
<p>They should realize that if the SPLC lies about them to raise money (and that is the point that Marti Oakley hasn&rsquo;t grokked yet, the SPLC is all about raising money and getting rich, really nothing else), then they should realize that the SPLC has been lying all along about those &#8220;white racists&#8221; they themselves try to distance themselves from incessantly.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Southern Poverty Lie Center.&#8221; I like that. I think Ms. Oakley has come up with a name that is perfectly appropriate for this trouble-making group.</p>
<p> And why, pray tell, do various members of the mainstream media insist on using the SPLC as an &#8220;identifier of hate groups&#8221;? Nobody designated them to do that. The media agree with them politically on most things, and thus can legitimize their own hatred of conservative or race realist groups by draping the mantle of respectability over the Lie Center, which oh, so helpfully confirms the MSM&rsquo;s political biases.</p>

</i> </p>
<p>I would say I agree with this writer, but the sad fact is that the SPLC is only one of the more extreme examples of many such groups, one of which is our own government, that exist in America today.</p>

		<p>Good to see lefties waking up to how sleazy the $PLC really is. I think what freaked them out was the revelation that these race hustlers have a Cayman Islands bank account.</p>
<p>Now if we could just take down the rest of &#8220;Anti-Racism, Inc.&#8221;: the ADL, NAACP, ACLU, La Raza, CAIR, etc&hellip; </p>

		<p>This is not news to me or probably anyone else here.  But this article should be posted in every newspaper and every student should have to read and do an essay on it.</p>
<p>Crazier things have happened.  For some reason I had to do an essay on MLK&rsquo;s I have a dream speech and I am finishing up my MBA.  That speech had something to do with business, right?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad (some) leftists are getting disillusioned with the SPLC, but before we praise this author, let&rsquo;s remember that most likely, Marti Oakley would be horrified to discover that we at Amren have posted this here and would immediately begin shrieking &#8220;I want nothing to do with those racist &#8216;white supremacists&rsquo;!&#8221; In other words, engaging in the same kind of crybaby fearmongering that the SPLC is doing.</p>

that. </p>

<p>My interpretations of the truths implied in this statement-the author might disagree-are: (1)the GWOT is both a hoax and a very lucrative business, (2) the purpose of DHS has nothing to do with terrorism and everything to do with cowing, browbeating and bullying white Americans who might be amenable to the Tea Party and other political tendencies even more distasteful to the ruling elite. </p>

		<p>The left has a rather limited playbook and they have come to believe their own fatuous lies&hellip;a real problem in the war for hearts and minds. Ol&rsquo; Abe was not very honest, but he was correct about not being able to fool all of the people all of the time. We are winning over, and will continue to attract, the &#8220;naive wing&#8221; of the left as deteriorating conditions compel them to wake up and smell the coffee. As for the truly self-hating lefty whites&hellip;they are dead to us.   </p>

<p>Comparing SPLC to Joseph McCarthy is an insult to the Senator who was simply fighting the communist infiltration in Hollywood. Looking at today&rsquo;s America it becomes obvious that the patriotic and heroic Senator from Wisconsin lost that battle.</p>

		<p>The SPLC are an organ of world communism. Always have been</p>
<p>Anyone who takes their cue from them on any topic is, at the very least, a communist sympathizer, i.e. The Ministry of State Media. When you see a TV talking head using the SPLC as a source of &#8216;true facts,&rsquo; what you are really witnessing is s propaganda mill getting their marching orders from the commissar. They call it infotainment&hellip;opinion masquerading as news. And they say communism died with the fall of the USSR..?</p>
<p>Bring back The Fairness Doctrine so that men of honor can rebut the Ministry&rsquo;s lies.</p>

		<p>It is dangerous to underestimate an adversary or overestimate<br>
ourselves. I am not at all persuaded that the only research done by SPLC is to scan the Net.  It is not unreasonable to suspect a lot of exchange of information between SPLC and &#8220;law&#8221; enforcement agencies, including feds.  It is not unreasonable to suspect the<br>
collection of a lot of personal information at the level of what otherwise would seem invasion of personal privacy.  This organization, at least at a covert level, has likely woven into its information assets a lot of sources.  It is very effective with the broad population  &mdash;  far moreso than any of our efforts.<br>

		<p>Again, one of the very clever (and effective ) programs of<br>
SPLC is TEACHING TOLERANCE.  It would be much more effective if<br>
based on hard science.  It could turn out to be a beachhead provided us by SPLC, most unintentionally, of course.</p>
