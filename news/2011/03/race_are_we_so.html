	<p>June 18, 2011  &mdash;  January 1, 2012 <br>
Museum: Natural History Museum</p>
<p>This traveling exhibition looks at race and racism in the United States through biological, cultural, and historical points of view. It explores the history of the idea of race and how race is viewed today, and discusses the role of science, particularly the findings of contemporary science that are overturning beliefs about race.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Race, are we so different&#8221;???</p>
<p>If they are asking if we all put our pants on one leg at a time then the answer is no. But if they start checking to see if we pull them all the way up the answer is yes. </p>
<p>If you ask the right questions in the right way you will always get the answers you want. </p>

		<p>Due to a series of unfortunate typographical errors, the last sentence reading:</p>
<p>&#8220;It explores the history of the idea of race and how race is viewed today, and discusses the role of science, particularly the findings of contemporary science that are overturning beliefs about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Should be read as:</p>
<p>&#8220;It explores the history of the idea of race and how race is viewed today, and discusses the role of the left, particularly the opinions of contemporary leftists that are overturning scientific fact by repeating lies nonstop.&#8221;</p>
<p>We at the Smithsonian regret the error.</p>

		<p>So different? No, of course not - indeed, the only difference between say, Norwegians and Nigerians is &#8220;skin-color.&#8221; You can clearly see all the similarities in the cultures and societies of those two nations!!  </p>

		<p>Contemporary science is overturning beliefs about race?!</p>
<p>Sounds more like Pseudo-scientific non-sense to me. This  reminds me of something said by Nobel prize winner James Watson just a few years back. I quote, &ldquo;There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically.&#8221; <br>
Those race-does-not-exist or it&rsquo;s-fuzzy-concept-at-best leftists should go take that quote and smoke it in their pipes. And if  geneticists were to uncover proof that many biologically influenced traits are more or less common in one race when compared with another, would we still have traveling exhibitions to spread that news far and wide?  </p>

<i>Race: Are We So Different?</i></p>
<p>The answer is yes. That&rsquo;s why we talk about &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. If we were the same, there would be no &#8216;diversity&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>yes #3, and if the populations of say, Norway and Haiti were switched, the conditions would follow.</p>

<p>I wish! Because (real science not psuedo-) science is overturning the belief that race is only skin deep. Science has shown that separate races should be regarded as separate species. The reason they are not is liberal ideology, not scientific taxonomy.</p>

		<p>&#8220;There are some ideas so absurd that only an intellectual could believe them.&#8221; <br>
    <br>
 &mdash;  George Orwell<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  <br>
 <br>
One of these ideas is the notion that race is only a social construct. In terms of absurdity this idea vies with the delusions that IQ differences mean nothing, that rapists are not motivated by sexual desire, and that most priestly pedophiles who abuse boys are heterosexuals. <br>
 <br>
The different races, and different sub races within races, differ profoundly in terms of average aptitudes, personality, and character. Those who pretend not to see this do not want to see it, and try to keep us from expressing what we see. <br>
 <br>
Because liberal intellectuals, and liberal intellectual wannabes cannot prove these beliefs scientifically they defend them with invective and the social and economic sanctions of political correctness. <br>

		<p>If the Smithsonian endorses this then everything they say must be true. Let me guess that the majority of the exhibition discusses White racism to all other races?<br>

		<p>Only the young and very inexperienced can be fooled with lies about race.  No matter what the left claims, almost all its members know the truth and know they are lying.<br>
For thousands of years, people knew and acknowledged the truth about racial differences.  Then, during the civil rights revolution, everyone was told that all races have the same abilities and that only white bigotry prevents the full realization of this.  Any opposing view was shut down.  Now, a half century later, even inexperienced people should know better because of the internet and the availability of coldly factual books.  The left sounds more and more like the Flat Earth Society as time goes on.</p>

		<p>At least they do unwittingly acknowledge there are different races and not one single human race although they couldnt get around that fact anyway so they used the singular.<br>
They get tied up in their own knots even with such a stupid rhetorical question.</p>

		<p>Actually, contemporary science is PROVING that racial differences are even greater than previously thought.  The research is being suppressed or ignored because it goes against &#8220;diversity is good&#8221;.</p>
<p>Exhibitions like this do immeasurably more harm than good  &mdash;  and the group suffering the most is, as usual, whites.</p>
