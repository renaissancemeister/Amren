<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Five thugs sent on a £2,000 trip to keep them out of trouble ended up attacking a man during the jaunt.</p>
<p>They were among 19 known troublemakers taken away to avoid clashes with English Defence League marchers near their homes.</p>
<p>Town hall bosses spent more than £2,100 on the day trip, which was supervised by a cop and five council staff, a court heard.</p>
<p>The group, aged 17 to 19, were taken to Blackpool Pleasure Beach amid fears they could become embroiled in the EDL march in Dudley, West Midlands.</p>
<p>But soon after arriving at the Lancashire resort, the Asian yobs began aiming racist chants at dad-of-two Derek Brownhill, 30.</p>
<p>Then Riad Hussain, 19, punched him so hard both his &#8220;feet left the ground&#8221; and he was knocked unconscious, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.</p>
<p>Prosecutor David Swinnerton said Sandwell Council organised the trip to &#8220;distract the 19 from anti-social behaviour&#8221; during the march against plans for a mosque in Dudley. Hussain was locked up for ten months.</p>
<p>Raja Rashid and Fahad Atiq, who were on bail at the time over a separate hammer attack, were given 21 months and 16 months.</p>
<p>Wasim Telhat and Mazahar Taheir received community orders. All five admitted assault.</p>
<p>Last night Race Equality Sandwell boss Derrick Campbell said: &#8220;I would not say the trip had failed. Its purpose was to keep them away from the march.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Keep them out of trouble?  Why?  Are they assuming the EDL marchers would have clobbered them?  No, it was more like the other way around.  If the &#8220;Race Equality Commission&#8221; wants to make life safer for the EDL, who am I to say no?</p>

		<p>Although it was stupid to give these &#8220;British&#8221; youths a free vacation, it did do a lot of help for the EDL.  If they were there and they clashed with the EDL, irrelevant of what the youths did, the EDL would have been call a hate group.  Whites can&rsquo;t do anything right apparently.  </p>
<p>Plus this showed the EDL can have a peaceful protest and who the real trouble makers are.  The Labor Party cannot accuse the EDL of inciting the attackers if they are nowhere around.</p>

		<p>With government spending tightening up in Britain, how much longer can nonsense like this go on?  The U.S. was long criticized for being discriminatory to racial minorities  &mdash;  until Europe got a taste of the problem itself.  The U.S. is still being condemned for its huge prison population.  Europe, take a hint, and start sending criminals to the lockup instead of on outings.  </p>

		<p>There will come a time when such people, regardless of if they were born in the West, will be forcibly repatriated to the nations of their ancestry.</p>
<p>I would make mere membership in a gang in the U.S. grounds for loss of citizenship and expulsion from the nation.</p>

		<p>Britain clearly needs &#8220;concealed carry&#8221; and &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; laws.</p>
<p>A magazine out of a .40 Smith &amp; Wesson as &#8220;walking fuselage hits&#8221; would have ended this problem forever.</p>
<p>Aim at the belt buckle for the first one and keep firing as the recoil draws the muzzle upward.</p>

		<p>This is crazy. it shows no respect for the inoccent people at thier day trip location. they should have been put in protective custody. Jail.<br>
Also if they were not born here they should be deported as standard procedure.<br>

		<p>The trip &#8220;was supervised by a cop and five council staff.&#8221; Yet for some reason, they were unable to stop the thugs from attacking somebody. If the youths were that uncontrollable and dangerous, they shoud have been in some kind of confinement. Sending them on an outing instead only teaches other potentially dangerous youth that they have nothing to fear as a result of being thugs.</p>

<p>A 19 year old is an adult, not a youth.</p>

<p>It kept them away from the march, yet they got into trouble anyway; but &#8216;Racial Equality boss&rsquo; won&rsquo;t admit that this ridiculous plan was a faliure.What can you say? These clowns have an answer for everything.<br>
Wake up England!</p>

<p>True. I live in Texas and say what you  want about the death penalty, but these thugs would be in jail, not on outings. I do think we jail far too many people over minor things like marijuana possesion but Europe, especially the UK, gives too many dangerous or violent people light punishment. If you&rsquo;re a thug, you belong in jail and on a chain gang.</p>
