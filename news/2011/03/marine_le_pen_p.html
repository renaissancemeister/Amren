<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12660329">Marine Le Pen Poll Rating Shock for French Politics</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An opinion poll suggesting far-right leader Marine Le Pen could win the first round of next year&rsquo;s presidential election has caused a shock in France.</p>
<p>The survey for Le Parisien newspaper puts the National Front leader, who took over from her father Jean-Marie in January, ahead of all other candidates.</p>
<p>It gives her 23% of the vote, 2% ahead of both President Nicolas Sarkozy and Socialist leader Martine Aubry.</p>
<p>However, some analysts question the accuracy of the online poll.</p>
<p>Online surveys are arguably less reliable than telephone polling, and Le Parisien&rsquo;s poll assumes Ms Aubry will be chosen as the Socialists&rsquo; candidate, while the party has yet to decide.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie Le Pen was the shock runner-up in the first round of the 2002 election, only to be massively defeated in the second against Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>Unwise to ignore</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for the new far-right leader to be ahead of both President Sarkozy and Ms Aubry is an astonishing result, the BBC&rsquo;s Hugh Schofield reports from Paris.</p>
<p>A story on the website of the left-of-centre daily Liberation says &#8220;politicians are hesitating between prudence and panic after the poll&#8221;.</p>
<p>On the basis of this opinion poll of 1,618 people, Ms Le Pen would automatically qualify for the second round run-off with one or other of the two mainstream party leaders.</p>
<p>In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen achieved second place, not first, in the first round, and his poll ratings were never as high as his daughter&rsquo;s are now, our correspondent notes.</p>
<p>Marine Le Pen, 42, has proved a canny successor to her father.</p>
<p>Where he was a brash provocateur with a devoted but clearly circumscribed following, her trump card is a kind of woman-on-the-street ordinariness which potentially has an even wider appeal among working and middle class voters, our correspondent says.</p>
<p>She has been at pains to junk some of the more overtly offensive aspects of the National Front&rsquo;s programme.</p>
<p>She is riding high on the sense of dissatisfaction that is not so much a wave as a permanent condition in France, our correspondent says.</p>
<p>As this poll suggests, there is in the country an entrenched appetite for anti-establishment, curse-on-all-your-houses populism - which the mainstream parties would be most unwise to ignore.<br>

<p>It&rsquo;s only &#8220;shocking&#8221; to the Usual Suspects, who will now have to ramp up the media propaganda to make certain too many Frenchmen and women don&rsquo;t start getting any Unapproved &#8220;far-right&#8221; ideas.</p>

<p>And those would be&hellip;?  Or is the hapless reader simply expected to conjure up his own visions of jackbooted stormtroopers scouring the streets of Paris?</p>
<p>Oh well, I expected nothing better of the BBC.<br>

		<p>If these numbers hold, then it&rsquo;s a big turnaround from 2007.  However, they&rsquo;re about on par with what happened in 2002, substitute father LePen for daughter, Jacques Chirac for Sarkozy.  Obviously, the left-right establishment circled the wagons in the runoffs, and leftists/socialists bit the bullet and voted Chirac.  What we have to hope this time around is that, compared to 2002, Marine LePen has made inroads or gained sympathy among the kind of voters who won&rsquo;t vote for her in the first round.  So that she has a chance to win the runoff.</p>

<p>Maybe the reason the French people have such an &#8220;entrenched appetite for anti-establishment&#8221; is that the establishment has such such an entrenched appetite for being against the French people?</p>

		<p>I have looked extensively at the Front National and GRECE websites linked to thinkers like Alain de Benoist. What we are seeing here is a valuable example for the Anglo Saxon UK/USA. Marine Le Pen also benefits from some very capable colleagues/operators around her and &#8216;Marianne Le Pen&rsquo; is one of those drop dead chic French lookers that can &#8216;sell&rsquo; our ticket in the future. I am cautiously optimistic&hellip;   </p>

		<p>This is good news, but let&rsquo;s hope that the French don&rsquo;t fall for the inevitable &#8220;I&rsquo;m tough on immigration&#8221; campaign from Sarkozy. Because that&rsquo;s what screwed Le Pen over in 2007, and might derail Marine&rsquo;s campaign in 2012.</p>

		<p>An opinion poll suggesting far-right leader Marine Le Pen could win the first round of next year&rsquo;s presidential election has caused a shock in France.</p>
<p>Just who exactly is shocked?  The article should have started like this:</p>
<p>Liberal socialist elites are shocked that the average native French citizen has caught on to their plan and are starting to wake up.</p>

		<p>If things don&rsquo;t start improving for Sarkozy and start improving fast, it is not at all unrealistic to expect the second round of the presidential election to be a LePen versus (socailist) Aubrey contest. But unlike in 2002 when LePen the father faced off against &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; right winger Chirac, but this time the more electable LePen daughter would be going up against the socialists, and those two factors will surely improve the odds of a win this time around. </p>

		<p>Newsweek has an almost-objective article on Marine Le Pen.  She is pro-choice and pro-social welfare state.  She is effectively expanding the FN&rsquo;s base into former socialist and communist strongholds of the north.  She appeals to the &#8216;early risers&rsquo; who make France work.  These are the same people infamously criticized as FN voters in the 1995 movie &#8216;La Haine&rsquo;.   </p>
<p>While she may not win the Presidency she will increase turnout for other FN candidates and help restore FN funding.</p>

		<p>As long as she doesn&rsquo;t start trying to change the FN as far as racial attitudes go in a pathetic attempt to gain popularity then I have no problem with her.</p>

		<p>Maybe the French are quietly getting sick and tired of seeing hundreds, maybe thousands, of male rear ends being stuck up in the air on Fridays as the muzzein shrieks out his raucous call.  Perhaps they want their country back   &mdash;   and they only way that&rsquo;ll happen is to elect a CONSERVATIVE government that is willing to kick some butt   &mdash;   but, sacre bleu, that may be going too far for the French; they&rsquo;ve forgotten, after all, that if it wasn&rsquo;t for us they&rsquo;d be speaking German and eating bratwurst instead of escargot.  So it does remain to be seen.  But like another poster here, I am cautiously optimistic. </p>
