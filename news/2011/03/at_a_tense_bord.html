<h1>At a Tense Border Crossing, A Systematic Effort to Keep Black Africans Out</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Doug Saunders, Globe and Mail (Toronto), March 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Two young men named Oboun Maabi and K.K. Ezekiel, friends and fellow construction workers from Ghana, may have been the only black men to escape from western Libya Tuesday. Their journey was neither safe nor easy.</p>
<p>They had slept in the freezing air for two nights as Tunisians blocked their passage. Waking before dawn Tuesday, they walked far into the Sahara to begin a six-hour hike through the desert. There they were picked up on the road, arrested, and finally deposited in a Tunisian refugee camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a really hard thing to do, but what we were facing there was deadly,&#8221; Mr. Maabi, 32, said as he searched for a phone to call his wife in Ghana.</p>
<p>What they escaped was a double threat. First, a Libyan population suspicious of anyone with dark skin after dictator Moammar Gadhafi hired thousands of sub-Saharan Africans as mercenaries. And second, a Tunisian border authority that has been preventing thousands of people, especially black Africans, from crossing.</p>
<p>This created a dangerous situation for the Ghanaians, Malians, Nigerians, Sudanese, Congolese and other African workers who rushed to flee Libya this week, only to find their way blocked by Tunisian gangs and soldiers who are controlling the flow of people across the border, often using violence.</p>
<p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees warned on Tuesday that Libya&rsquo;s western border, whose main road has seen 90,000 fleeing foreign workers in the past week, is becoming a &#8220;humanitarian disaster,&#8221; and specifically warned about the plight of black Africans. &#8220;We are very concerned that a large number of sub-Saharan Africans are not being allowed entry into Tunisia at this point,&#8221; said a spokeswoman for the UNHCR.</p>
<p>Indeed, hundreds of black Africans were penned in behind a wall Tuesday, far from the Tunisian entry point. Tunisian volunteers attempted to beat back reporters who spoke to them, but they said they had been held there for two days with little food or shelter. They were part of a group of several thousand foreign workers who were prevented from leaving.</p>
<p>The crush at the border turned menacing on Tuesday, as stick-wielding volunteers from the nearby town of Ben Gardane beat anyone  &mdash;  most were Egyptians  &mdash;  who tried to get through, and left thousands in a crush against a gate. Scores of overheated and dehydrated people were dragged over the wall, some unconscious.</p>
<p>Some Tunisians are angry at the more than 10,000 refugees who are encamped in their small town, believing the men are taking their jobs. Other people from the democracy movements in neighbouring towns are helping the refugees, providing food and volunteering at refugee camps.</p>
<p>But officials from the UNHCR confirmed that sub-Saharan Africans are being singled out for exclusion from the border, and kept in dangerous conditions in the no-man&rsquo;s-land between Libya and Tunisia. A few hundred Malians were allowed through over the weekend, but no black faces were visible Tuesday among the more than 10,000 people who did get through.</p>
<p>Tunisian officials say they are keeping the crowds corralled away from the entry point in order to limit the flow of refugees into camps along the border, which currently hold 9,000 people. Some 5,000 people leave for their home countries each day, but their places are quickly taken by those coming in. On Tuesday night, the UNHCR erected another 1,000 tents, each capable of holding eight to 10 people.</p>
<p>Tunisian officers ordered the volunteers out of the border area, provoking fistfights between soldiers and townspeople, watched with amazement by the thousands crushed against the border gate.</p>
<p>Officials said the sub-Saharan Africans were being kept back because of a policy of allowing national groups through one at a time. Many Bangladeshis and Chinese crossed over the weekend. But aid organizations said there appeared to be a systematic restriction of black Africans.</p>
<p>&#8220;They call out country by country  &mdash;  Bangladesh, Egypt, China  &mdash;  but they don&rsquo;t call out any African country,&#8221; Mr. Maabi said. &#8220;They tell us they do not want any blacks to come in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Malian government has been quick to fly its nationals back home, while other countries, notably Egypt, have been slower to respond. Egypt finally sent several ships to Tunisian ports on Tuesday, collecting several thousand workers, with more ships to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had any troubles as an African in Libya when I was working there,&#8221; says Mr. Maabi, who worked in the town of Zawiya, now fully under the bcontrol of anti-Gadhafi forces. &#8220;It is only this conflict. It has suddenly turned skin colour into something people fight about.&#8221;<br>

		<p>An &#8216;Arab brother&rsquo; who resembles a Tunisian in name and features will be more welcome than blacks.  Chinese and Filipinos get a pass because there is no dispute about them leaving for Asia.</p>
<p>There is a lesson which we saw in Hurricane Katrina: in a breakdown of order, racial extended family determines who one will ally with.</p>

		<p>Notice the assumption of innocence by the article.</p>
<p>The truth is that these blacks are re-locating either to work as murderers, rapists and worse, for these sick governments or fleeing the righteous anger of the populations they butchered.</p>
<p>Knowing what they did/are doing/want to do, changes the meaning of the article substantially.</p>

		<p> Pardon me if I don&rsquo;t burst into tears at the &#8220;plight&#8221; of the poor, poor sub-Saharan Africans. We&rsquo;ve all heard the words &#8220;plight&#8221; and &#8220;blacks&#8221; or &#8220;Africans&#8221; used together so many times that they&rsquo;ve lost all power to move us to anything but cynicism.</p>
<p> Looks like the Tunisians either have wised up as part of their revolution, or they were smarter than they were given credit for before. Why make excuses, though? Just say, &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want these blacks coming into our country!&#8221; See? The sky didn&rsquo;t fall, now did it?</p>

		<p>Why are they going to Tunisia instead of south and heading for the Chad and Niger borders unless they intend to catch a boat to Italy and then all points north?  I was watching a travel show some years ago and I&rsquo;m surprised how much European DNA seems to be present in the Tunisian population.  Many of them don&rsquo;t look Arabic/Berber at all.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Many Bangladeshis and Chinese crossed over the weekend.&#8221;  Sickening.  Apparently taking Tunisians&rsquo; jobs or resources only applies to black Africans, for every other group it&rsquo;s a-ok.  The East Asian exception always pops up which is why white people will continue to slide into oblivion because it&rsquo;s not about white survival it&rsquo;s about the survival of certain personality traits like not participating in petty crime and staying quiet.</p>

		<p>I worked in the Oil &amp; Gas Industry in Libya in 2009 and 2010. There are hundreds of thousands of foreign workers working in the Oil Patch there. </p>
<p>A lot of the skilled and semi-skilled labor coming mainly from naighboring Arab countries, IE: Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Jordan, Syria. You do see some Arabs in the more technical fields as well, several of the Engineers I worked with for example, even some in management. </p>
<p>The Supervisory and higher tech stuff is usually handled by European, Canadian, American and Australian ex-pats. Not just Office guys and techno-geeks, but the Driller or the Toolpusher (Drilling Foreman) on the rig crew is usually in this category. </p>
<p>The Sub-Saharan Africans are at the bottom of the totem pole in Libya. The Arabs don&rsquo;t like them, consider them to be beneath them. </p>
<p>Case in point, one day when I first got there I was going to the Client&rsquo;s office, when we went under an over-pass there were hundreds of Africans sitting around. I asked the driver who these guys were. He replied that there were day labor, waiting for work. He said &#8220;You know how you have all those Mexicans hanging around Home Depot in America?&#8221;, I said that I did, he replied &#8220;Same deal, they&rsquo;re our Mexicans&#8221;. </p>
<p>The camp I lived in in Tripoli had a bunch of Ghanans working in the restaurant, really nice bunch of guys too, I liked them. When the underwear bomber incident happened one of them told me &#8220;Damn Nigerians, they make trouble everywhere they go, now people will look at me and think I am a terrorist because I am African&#8221;.</p>
<p>Several of the foreign mercenaries are Nigerians, I hope that those boys who worked at the Camp are all OK. </p>

		<p>So Messrs. Maabi and Ezekiel went all the way to Libya, because they could not find work in Ghana. They couldn&rsquo;t get jobs as garbage collectors in the capital Accra? Tough! They were probably attracted by Qaddafi&rsquo;s socialist ideology, only to discover it was a mirage. </p>
<p>Tunisia has EVERY RIGHT to protect its borders and its subjects, whether the United Nations likes it or not. The country is going through its own upheaval, and the LAST THING they need is thousands of Bantus holding out their hands for gifts.</p>
<p>I just KNEW that stuff like this was going to happen, when Qaddafi brought in those Bantu mercenaries to kill Libyans. What did they expect, to be welcomed with open arms?</p>
<p>Ironic, isn&rsquo;t it? Arabs brought millions of slaves from Bantu Africa to the northern part of the continent and the Middle East. The descendants of the Bantus go to work for the descendants of the slave masters, while raging against European colonialization and the old South Africa.</p>

<p>Just  nonsense.  Blacks  have  always  lived  all  over  Africa  &mdash;  including  North  Africa.  I mean,  what  else  do  you expect?  It&rsquo;s  the  settlers  of  all  kinds  of  origins  that have  distorted  the  gene  pool  of  North  Africa.  North  Africa  has  been  a  playpen  for  all  kinds  of  border busters  of  dubious  origins  from  Roman times  onwards: Romans, Arabs, Turks,  French, Italians(who  practiced  genocide in what  is  now  Libya), British, etc.  Yet  they  all  think  they  can  hide  their  hodge-podge  origins  under  the  cloak  of  &#8220;Arabism&#8221;.</p>
<p>But  these  people  who  live  mainly  on  the  North  African coast  are  just  delusional  if  they  think  that  they  are  not living  and  surviving  on  the  African continent.  Gaddafi  recognised  that  fact when he stated  a  few  years  ago that  Libya  was  30%  black.  And the  rest?  I  have  seen  them  in West  Africa when  Gaddafi  chose  to  visit  with  his  usual  big  entourage.  No  mistake  about  it:  they  are  just  like  the  people  you  would  find  in  places  like  Puerto Rico, Panama,  Tropical  Brazil, Cuba, etc.  Nothing  special  there.</p>

<p>&#8221; I&rsquo;m surprised how much European DNA seems to be present in the Tunisian population. Many of them don&rsquo;t look Arabic/Berber at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrote some time ago about some &#8220;Tunisians&#8221; who attended my (Catholic) grammar school in the 1960s.  A family of four girls, all very pretty.  They were called French, spoke French, had Italian last names, but were born in Tunisia.  Only much later did I find out that there were very large populations of Sicilians (and French) who had been in Tunisia for centuries, but fled in the 1960s due to political upheavals.  I have actually met Tunisian-born American residents (with Arabic names) who have blue eyes.  So your observation is based in fact.</p>
<p>I believe - and maybe someone with more knowledge can confirm - that the majority of the population of North Africa from pre-Christian times (the Punic Wars, etc.) until the Islamic conquest were, in fact, European.  AND, well over a million Europeans were taken as slaves by the muslims, and brought into the Near and Mid -East, and thus, would have impacted the gene pool.</p>

<p>Based  on  haplogroup  analysis  &mdash;  which  stretches back thousands  of years  &mdash;  the  majority[ more than 50%] do  not  belong  to  European  haplogroups.  The  majority  haplotype  in  North  Africa  is  the  African  E1ab1b. On the  female  side there are  lots  of  South  European  haplogroups  &mdash;  supporting  the thesis  about  kidnapped  European  women for  the  harems  and slave  farms of  North  Africa, West  Asia and  Turkey.</p>

<p>First of all, the word Soprano Fan used was Bantu - not black. Nilotics may have dwelled in parts of North Africa, and Pygmies in Southern Africa, but Bantus were restricted to Western Africa until fairly recently.</p>
<p>Native North Africans are Berbers and look like Zinedine Zidane and the Coptic Egyptians, now dispossesed by Arabs. Most Bantu blood is a result of slavery, as it is in Arabia, Iran and the Americas. Implying that the Arab-Berber mix has been whitened by the British is plainly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Gaddafi has changed tack with blacks so often its not worth believing a word he says either.</p>

<p>I  have  been  to  Morocco  and  have  a  good  picture  of  what  North  Africans  look  like.  No, they  do  not  lool  like  Zedane.  In  fact  it&rsquo;s  quite  possible  that  he&rsquo;s  not  of  indigenous  North  African ancestry.  After  all,  North  Africa was  colonised  by  Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Turks, Italians, French  and  British.  So  who  knows where  Zedane&rsquo;s family  tree  originated.</p>
<p>Again  West  Africa  proper  has  never  been  home  to  Bantu  speakers.  The  Bantu  expansion  began  in  Central  Africa(the  Cameroon)  and  spread  to  all  of  Southern Africa  &mdash;  not  West  Africa  proper.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read a few articles about subsaharans complaining about how racist North Africans are to them and saying that these North Africans think they&rsquo;re living in Europe instead of Africa and it&rsquo;s accompanied by all sorts of pictures of people sitting in outdoor cafes. The scenes looked like something straight out of a Paris tourism ad instead of Lawrence of Arabia.  Of course, they could have been tourists or expats at a European owned establishment. </p>
