<h1>Museum&rsquo;s &#8216;Race&rsquo; Scores With Businesses</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Stodghill, Charlotte Observer, March 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Discovery Place opened the &#8220;Race: Are We So Different?&#8221; exhibit last month, it wasn&rsquo;t hard to imagine the display inspiring a science-based kumbaya moment.</p>
<p>Over the past six weeks, museum attendance has hit 48,000, a 40 percent increase over the same period last year, driven largely by the popularity of its exhibit.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more intriguing, though, is that museum officials say the spike in attendance is based largely on the exhibit&rsquo;s popularity among corporate groups. Companies are using the exhibit, and an ancillary program dubbed &#8220;Race Exchange,&#8221; to hold what may as well be off-site diversity seminars.</p>
<p>Some 90 business groups are booked for the exhibit, which ends in early May. As part of the program, the groups, which average some 20 participants, air their thoughts on issues ranging from racial stereotypes that hurt upward mobility to the pride people should take in their racial heritage.</p>
<p>The exhibit&rsquo;s timing has proven fortuitous, says Logan Stewart, a marketing manager for Discovery Place, noting that &#8220;Race&#8221; opened amid the brouhaha of plans by the white nationalist organization American Renaissance to host its annual convention in Charlotte. After protests the group, labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, ended up canceling.</p>
<p>Add to that planned closings of schools and libraries  &mdash;  many in black neighborhoods  &mdash;  and local NAACP head Rev. Kojo Nantambu dubbing Charlotte a &#8220;racist bastion,&#8221; and there&rsquo;s a whole heap of race baggage to unload.</p>
<p>The exhibit makes a powerful point: that the age-old arguments over race tend to be misguided. It uses plenty of cool photos, artifacts and multimedia activities to underscore that humans are more alike than different; in fact, genetically, we&rsquo;re virtually carbon copies compared to other living species.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, companies themselves contribute to making race the hot-button topic it is. As the economy slowly picks up, for example, most minorities are finding it tougher than whites to climb back into the workplace.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For now, at least, we&rsquo;ll have to take healthy race talk wherever we can get it. <br>

		<p>Exhibits of this sort   &mdash;  - I think its home site is the Smithsonian   &mdash;  - recalls the 2003 PBS series, &#8220;Race: The Power of An Illusion,&#8221; which was admirably critiqued in, of all places, the New York Times. Excerpts of the Alessandra Staley review below: </p>
<p>To make the point that people are all alike under the skin, PBS interviewed not one or two but eight eminent scholars who all agree: under the skin, people are all alike. </p>
<p>Instead of diversity of opinion, PBS&rsquo;s three-part series &#8221;Race: The Power of an Illusion&#8221; offers viewers a racially diverse selection of like-minded experts, ranging from Stephen Jay Gould, the white Harvard paleontologist who died last year, to Evelynn Hammonds, a black female professor of History of Science and Afro-American Studies at Harvard. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The series could more aptly be titled &#8221;PBS: The Power of Self-Delusion,&#8221; a study of how a publicly owned television network with a mandate to challenge the mind can instead put even the most caffeinated brains to sleep. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&#8221;Race is a human invention,&#8221; Ms. Hammonds says. &#8221;Race is a concept we invented to categorize the perceived biological, social and cultural differences between human groups.&#8221; </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There is no discussion, let alone lively debate, about the issues confounding our society, from college affirmative-action admissions policies to racial profiling. Instead, it is a history lesson about economic and social injustice that PBS has told well, many times, and with much of the same source material. Like the character played by Bill Murray in &#8221;Groundhog Day,&#8221; PBS keeps reliving the horrors of slavery, segregation and discrimation without advancing to the more politically and culturally sensitive issues of race relations today. </p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The documentary goes out of its way to avoid conflict. There are some scholars who contest the notion that race is neither genetic nor biological, but they are not interviewed. Instead, the documentary shows a short clip of John Entine, author of &#8221;Taboo: Why Black Athletes Dominate Sports and Why We&rsquo;re Afraid to Talk About It,&#8221; heatedly expressing his views on CNN&rsquo;s &#8221;Talk Back Live,&#8221; a television format that reduces all guests to the level of hollering crackpots. </p>
<p>The famous quote of Justice Harry A. Blackmun of the United States Supreme Court is the film&rsquo;s conclusion: &#8221;In order to get beyond racism we must first take account of race.&#8221; Oddly, however, reliably decent PBS does not trust its own viewers&rsquo; decency enough to take account of an opposing view.</p>

<p>Humans are more alike than different from chimpanzees.  I await the newspaper column explaining how there are no real differences between humans and chimps.</p>
<p>Just more confused nonsense,  no the one hand, there is apparently no such thing as race. On the other, black people should be proud of their racial heritage and get preferential treatment on the basis of their (supposedly unexistent) race.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much reading between the lines to know that this should read &#8220;the pride <i>non-white</i> people should take in their racial heritage&#8221; for, as we all know, white pride is something shameful. </p>
<p>Every race can take pride in their &#8220;racial heritage&#8221; except whites. Why? I dunno. The only thing I can think is that whites are singularly prone to evil and are uniquely likely to use pride in their own racial heritage as a license to oppress others. So much for &#8220;no differences between the races,&#8221; I guess.</p>

<p>In other words, this museum exhibit is not so much &#8220;science&#8221; as propaganda. The article dropped any pretense of balance after this point.</p>

		<p>That whole article is bogus happy-talk double-speak.</p>
<p>First, the writer (who is black) seems so ill-informed that he buys right into the liberal propaganda. Worse, he assumes that the exhibit, with its &#8220;plenty of cool photos,&#8221; is the last word on the subject.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid he might have to read a detailed journal article on race and behavior.</p>
<p>Then he writes: <br>
&#8220;The exhibit makes a powerful point: that the age-old arguments over race tend to be misguided. It uses plenty of cool photos, artifacts and multimedia activities to underscore that humans are more alike than different; in fact, genetically, we&rsquo;re virtually carbon copies compared to other living species.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, he qualifies the statement. Here it is again with CAPS inserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exhibit makes a powerful point: that the age-old arguments over race TEND to be misguided. It uses plenty of cool photos, artifacts and multimedia activities to underscore that humans are MORE ALIKE THAN DIFFERENT; in fact, genetically, we&rsquo;re VIRTUALLY carbon copies compared to other living species.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, what is it? </p>
<p>What it is, in the final analysis, is propaganda. It is mind control. This exhibit does a huge disservice to society by lying to people. Besides, how can one celebrate &#8220;diversity&#8221; if everyone is the same?</p>

		<p>I wonder what is motivating these companies to waste employee time and company money on liberal indoctrination. Another matter is  which employees attend, and whether these employees have any choice. Is this a days outing for useless Diversityites, or is it used to humiliate and degrade white male employees? Or both? Inquiring minds want to know.</p>

<p>The author seems trying to prove our point for us; that diversity, tolerance, and the dialogue on race are really just about &#8216;hating&rsquo; and blaming white people. And about promoting the causes and issues of those who aren&rsquo;t white. And that if whites were to have issues of their own (who knows what AmRen might bring up? - he dismisses AmRen in his article), those issues would be evil too (as whites themselves are). With the author&rsquo;s one sided propaganda, and his &#8216;hateful screed&rsquo;, he more or less makes our point for us. Unfortunately, few will recognize this point, for this kind of one-sided outlook and this anti-white propaganda is the only game in town and the only dialogue on race we&rsquo;re allowed to listen to. </p>

		<p>Draw a timeline.  Use stick-pins and insert &#8216;major events that changed history&rsquo; from the discovery of advanced Achulean toolsets to domesticated animals to irrigation and sea travel to wars which brought groups together or shielded them, genetically.</p>
<p>Now pull out all your stick pins and put them on a world map.  Who has the most, _by continent_?</p>
<p>After about 10KYA, you should see a shift from the near east and central Asia to Europe, accelerating to a point where almost ALL &#8216;modern&rsquo; (last 1,500 years) major cultural, scientific, art, philosophy and engineering events are associable to the Western Tradition.</p>
<p>And then there are the nulls.  Africa, South East Asia, The Americas.  Where either there is nothing or there is something but it was &#8216;a stage&rsquo; that other, Mediterranean and Near Eastern and then European cultures went through FIRST, thousands of years before.</p>
<p>This is how we know we are a common race.  Because there are indeed a lot of symmetries between cultural advancement levels and period &#8216;discoveries&rsquo;: pyramid building, most useless form of architecture known to man and &#8216;we all thought of it&rsquo;, comes to mind.</p>
<p>It is this time differential which should be studied as a clue to how genetics work.  Because the cumulative mutation and gene flip factors will tell you where each &#8216;population group&rsquo; is at.  The obvious conclusion being that, yes, we are the same people but like a set of five siblings, born unto greatness at different moments in our lives, we are on tangential, sequentially divergent, evolutionary routes.</p>
<p>We _cannot_ give up striving for our own folkway as a genepath, solely to bring up the younger brothers and sisters to our level.</p>
<p>This is non-concurrent evolution of separate subspecies that we label &#8216;race&rsquo;, solely because we are uncomfortable with the obvious: it&rsquo;s genes.  It&rsquo;s _always been the genes_.</p>

		<p>So if race really doesn&rsquo;t exist, this means racism can&rsquo;t really exist either.  If &#8220;white&#8221; and &#8220;black&#8221; are just &#8220;perceived,&#8221; then how can affirmative aciton exist?  How can groups like the NAACP continue?  Shouldn&rsquo;t university professors and the media go out of their way to tell &#8220;race&#8221;-specific groups (like La Raza or NAACP) how silly they are, basing group affiliation on perceived differences that are really just superficial?</p>
<p>The problem with liberals and blacks is that they want to have it both ways.  If race doesn&rsquo;t exist (and &#8220;blacks&#8221; are truly equal in ability to &#8220;whites&#8221;) we shouldn&rsquo;t need affirmative action, quotas, &#8220;diversity&#8221; training  &mdash;  as no diversity truly exists. </p>
<p>But if racial differences do exist, we should realistically assess the skills and abilities of each group genetically.  For instance, the superiority of the black athlete in sprinting or basketball is well documented.  Perhaps in other areas of life similar characteristics occur. Maybe the white is smarter than other races in any legitimate measure of intelligence, innovation, and industriousness?  Or maybe we just perceive the Occident to be a better, more-developed world than Africa.</p>
