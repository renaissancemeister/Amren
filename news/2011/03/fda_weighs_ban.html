	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, black smokers are four times more likely to choose menthols than white smokers. (Gardiner quit smoking long ago.) By 2005, half of black smokers smoked Newports, the most popular menthol brand.</p>
<p>Gardiner [Phillip Gardiner], a scientist with the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program at the University of California Office of the President, calls this the &#8220;African-Americanization of menthol cigarette use.&#8221; Once a niche product smoked mainly by women, menthols became the cigarette of choice for black smokers thanks in part to targeted marketing in urban centers and in publications aimed at black readers.</p>
<p>Now the Food and Drug Administration is considering a ban on menthol cigarettes, fueling a debate about how such a move would impact African Americans. {snip} Lorillard, maker of Newports, and R.J. Reynolds, maker of Kools, filed a lawsuit Feb. 25 to block the committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The suit alleges that the committee can&rsquo;t provide fair advice because three members have conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The latest draft chapter, posted Monday in advance of the panel&rsquo;s meeting Thursday and Friday, cites a 2010 report that found African Americans across-the-board  &mdash;  no matter their income, age, sex, marital status, region, education, age they started or length of time smoking  &mdash;  are more likely to smoke menthols than any other racial or ethnic group.</p>
<p>Newports are the lifeblood of Lorillard, the oldest U.S. tobacco company, which has framed the debate as a civil rights issue. One Lorillard ad, with a photo of an African-American woman, bears the headline &#8220;Freedom of Choice for Grown-ups&#8221; and states &#8220;informed grown-ups who decide to smoke should have the freedom to choose menthol cigarettes.&#8221; </p>
<p>In op-ed pieces published on a number of websites over the past few months, Jessie Lee, executive director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, and Malik Aziz, national chair of the National Black Police Association, argue that a menthol cigarette ban would lead to an illegal market.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Research has shown that flavored cigarettes attract young new smokers. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, signed by President Obama in June 2009, authorized the FDA to ban all cigarette flavors except minty menthol, whose brands represent more than a quarter of cigarettes sold in the USA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Banning flavored cigarettes, which mask the harshness of tobacco  &mdash;  something that can deter some first-time smokers, especially children  &mdash;  is a positive move,&#8221; they [seven former HHS or HEW secretaries and one surgeon general in an open letter to Congress] wrote. &#8220;But, by failing to ban menthol, the bill caves to the financial interests of tobacco companies and discriminates against African Americans.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an interview, David Howard, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds, maker of Kools and three other menthol brands, disputed the notion that tobacco companies market menthols more heavily to blacks. &#8220;We market our brands to all adults who chose to smoke, regardless of their ethnic background,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;All of our marketing approaches are to appeal to as broad an audience as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Documents released</b></p>
<p>One need only scan the Internet for images of menthol cigarette ads from the 1960s and 1970s to gain some insight into their popularity among black smokers.</p>
<p>Many feature carefree African-American models or celebrities. Phillip Gardiner says ads featuring Kool spokesman Elston Howard of the Yankess, the first black player to win the American League&rsquo;s Most Valuable Player award, helped woo him in the 1960s.</p>
<p>A 1978 internal Lorillard memo, with the subject &#8220;Black Marketing Research  &mdash;  Findings &amp; Recommended Actions to Date,&#8221;suggests such promotions as calendars depicting black athletes and black women and distribution of free Newport samples at &#8220;Black conventions, expos, etc.&#8221; </p>
<p>That industry document is one of thousands released as a result of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement between tobacco companies and 46 states. They provide an inside look at how the industry forged ties with African-American organizations such as the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and the NAACP. (Despite its name, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, is a totally separate organization.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lorillard provided economic support to the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Congressional Black Caucus and the National Conference of Black Mayors and others, according to the documents. R.J. Reynolds did so with the National Black Police Association, the National Urban League and the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, among others, the documents show.</p>
<p>Neither Jessie Lee of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives nor Malik Aziz of the National Black Police Association replied to USA TODAY&rsquo;s requests for information about their groups&rsquo; current or past relationship with Lorillard. Their recently published op-ed pieces echoed Lorillard&rsquo;s argument that a menthol ban would lead to a contraband market for menthol cigarettes.</p>
<p>Lorillard spokesman Gregg Perry acknowledged that the company hired a public relations firm to pitch the anti-ban op-ed pieces written by leaders of African-American organizations. {snip}</p>
<p>Yerger says she&rsquo;s puzzled black leaders would oppose a ban, since smoking-related diseases disproportionately affect African Americans. &#8220;Do they really get what&rsquo;s going on in terms of the health effects on our people when it comes to smoking in general, menthol use in particular?&#8221;<br>

		<p>Now discrimination is selling blacks a product that they want, and prefer to buy over another product they don&rsquo;t want to buy. </p>
<p><br>
Up next: Regulation, and antidiscimination lawsuits against Church&rsquo;s chicken, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Lee&rsquo;s Chicken, Popeyes, a dozen smaller chains, fruit stands &amp; supermarkets that sell watermelons, beer companies that make malt liquor, makers of fortified wines, distributors of said products, and individual stores that sell menthol cigarettes, fried chicken, watermelon, fortified wine, and malt liquor. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see flavored rolling papers, flavored cigars &amp; cigar wrappers on the chopping block as well. </p>
<p>Sadly, in this case, I feel for the black man. They&rsquo;ve been getting the shaft on this since they banned the 40oz bottle in most areas. Now they sell them 24oz cans, and 32oz cans for more than what a 40 oz resealable bottle used to go for. The virtual ban (through excessive taxation) on roll your own cigarettes pretty much forced blacks to Kool, and Newports as the alternative.  It seems like every time the legislature gets involved it ends up costing them more money to get their drink on, get their smoke on, and eat foods high in saturated fats. (Okay, I&rsquo;ve yet to see watermelon come under attack yet, but its only a matter of time!)</p>

		<p>THEY smoke more and it is harder for THEM to stop.</p>
<p>Menthol is a big reason for THEIR inability to stop? I am not sure.</p>
<p>Father Pfleger in Chi was dead set against all the cig ads and specifically so the menthol ads. And if Father Pfleger said it was bad it MUST be bad.</p>

Blacks have long held that there is a conspiracy to push menthol cigarettes in the black community; that menthol cigarettes are specifically targeted to blacks.</p>
<p>Newports and Kool are certainly popular with blacks, so much so, they&rsquo;re seen as a stereotype brand.</p>
<p>Of course, black magazines like Ebony and Jet have certainly benefited from menthol cigarette ads. They certainly didn&rsquo;t refuse these ads.<br>

		<p><i>Once a niche product smoked mainly by women, menthols became the cigarette of choice for black smokers thanks in part to targeted marketing in urban centers and in publications aimed at black readers.</i></p>
<p>Funny, I started smoking clove cigarettes without any influence from advertising (because there wasn&rsquo;t any), and then I had to switch to clove filtered &#8220;cigars&#8221; since the cigarettes had been banned. It wasn&rsquo;t advertising that kept me smoking them, it was half my addiction to them and half my preference for clove smokes.</p>
<p>Thinking back, I once smoked menthols, but I guess I outgrew them. Perhaps they were/are marketed to new smokers, but after a while I didn&rsquo;t like them anymore. They give me a headache now.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that adults should be able to make decisions without the nanny state involved, especially with things such state deems &#8220;dangerous&#8221;. The premise of this nanny state regulation is that we, whether black or white or whatever, are not smart enough to chose for ourselves.</p>

		<p>This is the predatory marketing argument.</p>
<p>The argument supposes that blacks are victims of predatory marketers to take advantage of poor black folk. </p>
<p>This is the same argument that was used to explain (excuse?) the high number of non-Whites who lost their homes due to foreclosure. </p>
<p>In that instance, you will recall, blacks earlier complained they were being left out of the housing market due to racist lending companies who preferred Whites over blacks. After the gov&rsquo;t pressured mortgage companies to racially equalize their mortgage portfolios, many blacks complained they were victims of predatory lending. </p>
<p>You can win. Many blacks will always find a racist angle to excuse their failures. </p>

		<p>Anyone who has travelled extensively throughout black Africa, especially Nigeria, Kenya and RSA, will confirm the proliferation of huge roadside advertising boards extolling the virtues of menthol cigarettes, especially Kools. These cannot be targetting the very few non-blacks there so one can only conclude this menthol thing is definitely a racially black &#8216;cultural&rsquo; phenomena. I have no idea how much these things cost in black Africa but since we in UK are constantly bombarded by appeals to feed starving kids, build schools, drill water wells etc etc, I can only conclude that if they can afford to smoke, they don&rsquo;t need our aid. I suppose the same applies to any blacks collecting welfare in USA, if they are going to burn it, they shouldn&rsquo;t get it.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, when I smoked, it was usually Marlboro for most whites and almost always Kool for the blacks.  My impression was that blacks smoked Kools simply because whites didn&rsquo;t.  As I recall, Kools were extremely strong in the menthol department, and overall a pretty rough smoke.  I never remember blacks (or anyone for that matter) smoking Newport.  Maybe it was a regional thing.</p>
<p>In any case, banning menthol cigarettes will not help the &#8220;black community&#8221; rise above their indigenous problems.  And with the price of cigarettes these days, who can afford them?  Dope is probably cheaper.</p>

		<p>With much of the black community, you&rsquo;re damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t.  The abortion controversy is another good example.  Planned Parenthood provides abortion access in many ghetto areas, presumably because poor women have problems paying for the procedure.  Some blacks complain that whitey is trying to commit genocide  &mdash;  since half of all black women&rsquo;s pregnancies are aborted  &mdash;  but, if abortion clinics disappeared from the ghettos, then blacks would complain that they&rsquo;re being denied their rights.  <br>
To many blacks, society will never do right by them.  Moreover, they insist that companies like Church&rsquo;s Chicken are trying to sterilize or kill them, and yet plenty of such products are still selling in the ghettos.  The time is way past to simply start ignoring such whining and accusations of racism. </p>

		<p>As usual, there is no mention of personal responsibility&hellip;As the media would have it, blacks are just magically afflicted with their myriad problems instead of being responsible for their own actions and their own health.  Yes, obesity, diabetes, and cigarette smoking are just syndromes that are racist and automatically attach themselves to blacks.  The only good thing about this country going bankrupt is that maybe we won&rsquo;t be able to pay for all of their self-induced problems anymore.  As someone who is entering health care, I find it very difficult to respect people who consistently won&rsquo;t respect their own bodies and health.</p>

		<p>I agree- it is a case of damned if you do and damned if you don&rsquo;t with the black community. Obviously someone is smoking these if they are still for sale and having worked at various grocery and convenience outlets I can tell you that menthol smokers tend to be blacks or women. I don&rsquo;t think that I ever saw a male of any other race but black buying menthols. </p>

<p>So the FDA   &mdash;   which, as a federal entity, is supposedly sworn to serve the health needs ALL Americans, equally and without discrimination   &mdash;   now clearly regards the health of ONE ethnicity to be of special importance and attention. </p>
<p>In much the same way that Eric Holder&rsquo;s Department of Justice   &mdash;   also supposedly sworn to serve all Americans&rsquo; equally   &mdash;   now clearly regards ONE ethnicity&rsquo;s civil rights to be worthy of special protection.</p>
<p>If white liberals wish to bestow special privileges and extra rights to blacks, well, at this pint we white non-liberals may not be able to stop them. But something we CAN do is make them stop claiming that they&rsquo;re doing it in the holy name of &#8220;racial equality&#8221;. Because as I showed above, &#8220;racial equality&#8221; is NOT what we&rsquo;re getting. There is STILL racial inequality in America   &mdash;   the only difference is that now the inequality flows in the opposite direction. No meaningful equality has been achieved. All they&rsquo;ve succeeded in doing is reversing the &#8220;victimized&#8221; and &#8220;privileged&#8221; groups. </p>

<p>Nonsense!  Otherwise, let them pay their own medical bills when they come down with cancer, emphysema, etc.  It most certainly IS society&rsquo;s  business when your &#8220;nanny state&#8221; winds up paying the  (enormous) bills for their lives of dissipation and bad judgement. The premise of the &#8220;nanny state&#8221;,  that many people are not smart enough to make informed decisions, is quite right in this case!  They really aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Yes, many whites do make poor lifestyle choices, but blacks do so far more commonly. Blacks are impulsive creatures of the moment who   give little thought  to the future. And they are notorious for following unhealthy llifestyles. Eventually, they face the consequences when Mother Nature ultimately presents the hefty bill. Why should your &#8220;nanny state&#8221;  (meaning us) have to pay it and look after them?  </p>
<p>My father, long dead, was a heavy smoker.  But that was way back when smoking, as presented in every Hollywood movie, was considered sophisticated and &#8220;the thing to do&#8221;.  Now we know better.  </p>
<p>Smoking today is for self-destructive jerks. Personally, I would rather light up a dollar bill than a cigarette.  What&rsquo;s the difference?   It&rsquo;s just another way of throwing away good money&hellip; except the tobacco will kill you, the paper won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The key words in the article (very cleverly used)  are <i> &#8220;informed adults&#8221;</i>; but most blacks are neither (no matter what their age).  Children need to be guided and controlled, for their own good   &mdash;   and for ours.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re the bill payer, it IS your business.<br>

		<p>Speaking as a former street cop, here is something that you can take to the bank:</p>
<p>If you find a white girl with Newports, she has a black boyfriend/baby daddy/whatever. </p>
<p>That has been a 100% correlation in my experience.</p>
