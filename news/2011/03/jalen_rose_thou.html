<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jalen Rose played on the Fab Five teams at Michigan.</p>
<p>Now he&rsquo;s helped produce a documentary about the college basketball program that created a culture shift in basketball with black socks and baggy pants. The Times hated the Blue Devils.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, Duke was personal. I hated Duke and I hated everything I felt Duke stood for,&#8221; Rose says in the film. &#8220;Schools like Duke didn&rsquo;t recruit players like me. I felt like they only recruited black players that were Uncle Toms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The faces of Duke, I didn&rsquo;t like them,&#8221; Jimmy King said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hated Duke. I hated Duke,&#8221; Ray Jackson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coach K, you have Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill, yeah, they winning and keep in mind they won a championship the year before,&#8221; Juwan Howard said. &#8220;I respect that but we are talented, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was jealous of Grant Hill. He came from a great black family, congratulations,&#8221; Rose said. &#8220;Your mom went to college and was roommates with Hillary Clinton. Your dad played in the NFL, is a very well-spoken and successful man. I was upset and bitter that my mom had to bust her hump for 20-plus years. I was bitter that I had a professional athlete that was my father that I didn&rsquo;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of the hate was directed toward Laettner, who was considered the best player on the Duke team and was often the catalyst when people pointed out what they didn&rsquo;t like about Duke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duke was like America&rsquo;s team and Christian Laettner was like God and I didn&rsquo;t like him,&#8221; Howard said. </p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Christian Laettner was soft,&#8221; King said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overrated,&#8221; Jackson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty boy,&#8221; Howard said.</p>
<p>Others had more disparaging words for the former Duke standout not suitable for using here.</p>

		<p>After the Duke lacrosse debacle, I thought I would never defend that school again.  Oh well.</p>
<p>What Jalen Rose is talking about here is that Duke&rsquo;s basketball program doesn&rsquo;t recruit blacks, especially not ghetto blacks, for the sake of having blacks on the team.  For the most part, (with a few historical exceptions, i.e. Corey Magette, Elton Brand), the kind of player that gets a scholarship to Duke for basketball (black or otherwise) would be able to get into Duke based on academics anyway even if he would have never played basketball.</p>
<p>But what Mr. Rose is going is implicating his own school in academic fraud.  Michigan is supposed to be one of the best public schools in the country.  Obviously, ceteris paribus, it&rsquo;s harder to get into Duke than Michigan, but by the same token, it&rsquo;s not easy to get into Michigan either.  Jalen Rose and most of his &#8220;fab five&#8221; cohorts shouldn&rsquo;t have gotten into Michigan any sooner than they should have gotten into Duke.  But Michigan did recruit them and admit them, proving that they, unlike Duke, lowered their standards for the sake of the hoops program.</p>

		<p>These statements are but more examples of rampant black racism directed at white athletes. A white dominated Duke team defeated the &#8220;fab five&#8221; from Michigan in the 1992 NCAA championship game. Christian Laettner scored 19 points in that memorable game. </p>

		<p> The Fab Five &#8220;hated&#8221; Christian Laettner.</p>
<p> Oh, wait, that must have been a typo. Black, liberal people are incapable of &#8220;hatred.&#8221; That&rsquo;s the province of racist, right-wing redneck White people.</p>
<p> It must have been that they &#8220;hatted&#8221; him. Yeah, that&rsquo;s it; they got together and bought him a hat.</p>
<p> No, no, that&rsquo;s not right. Oh, I know, they &#8220;rated&#8221; him   &mdash;   highly, for a White boy, that is, but soft. Whatever that means.</p>
<p> Or, or   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ve got it: They &#8220;sated&#8221; him! They bought him dinner, and insisted that he eat until he was stuffed like a Christmas Uncle Tom turkey!</p>
<p> OK, enough of the comedy. The Fab Five have proved that they are just as annoying and obnoxious now as they were 20 years ago. They hated Duke because Duke was mostly White, and Duke&rsquo;s players proved that, Yes, Virginia, White boys CAN play basketball, despite what all the clever Left-wing sports columnists and late-night comedians have been telling you for years.</p>
<p> And by the way: I&rsquo;ll bet the only way Jalen Rose&rsquo;s momma busted her hump was in getting to the post office on the first of the month to get her welfare check.</p>

		<p>But for basketball those guys are nothing. I&rsquo;m tired of this sports culture where ball players are applauded as if they&rsquo;ve really accomplished something great. It&rsquo;s only a game, it&rsquo;s just entertainment. Seeing whites get excited over these big lug, criminal, illiterate, tatted up, ghetto acting dolts is revolting to witness. How many of these basketball players, college and professional, have been implicated in things like rape? Drop the baloney, they&rsquo;re not really students but are there to just throw a ball around. My advice is to turn the television off and get out there and engage in some sport yourself, at whatever level you&rsquo;re at; lose that beer-gut, put some pep into your step. Clean, wholesome sports viewing is fine. Tune out the profane ghetto garbage, it&rsquo;s a cancer of the eyes and brain.  </p>

		<p>And how many NCAA championships did they win?  Oh, that&rsquo;s right, they didn&rsquo;t.  Much of their history there has been expunged, because they were a bunch of dishonest thugs.  I remember because I used to be a NCAA basketball fan then.  Used to be a boxing fan too, until Mike Tyson came along.</p>

		<p>Well said - Chicagoan ! I am sick and tired of Americans obssessing on something as worthless as sports. Lets face it, what REAL difference does it make to your life or my life if team X or Y wins the superbowl ? Nothing ! Neither of us earn a dime. Instead, we should switch off the idiot box (TV) and focus hard of things that really matter - education, research, careers and creative activities. Ironically, the present generation of American idiots are being surpassed &amp; outdone by foreigners who come from very impoverished third world backgrounds ( Asia). I make it a point to let my two beautiful but impressionable blonde blue eyed daughters know that certain things are unacceptable. This means Homework and good grades over music and mobile phone / TV/ Ghetto Sports Thugs &amp; Facebook nonsense. Ofcourse, in these days of media / peer pressure, people like me are seen as the bad guys for simply acting like good responsible parents. The liberals from the 60&rsquo;s have done a &#8220;fine&#8221; job screwing the west and American society in general. I seriously believe that we are our worst enemies. I dread the retarded popular culture we are following even more than some terrorist on a random plane to NY.</p>

		<p>I remember watching this one on one pick up game, waiting my turn to play, with others.  One on one, winner&rsquo;s out, half court, ten baskets wins.  One player was an athletic black guy, graceful to watch.  The other was a dumpy, balding white guy.  The athletic black guy had six inches on the dumpy white guy.  The game progressed according to Hoyle, except that the dumpy white guy gracelessly made his shots about as much as the athletic black guy.  This was a close game, amazing to watch.  With both players close to ten baskets, the dumpy white guy scored.  He went to half court, and began dribbling the ball.  The athletic black guy then called a walking violation and demanded the ball.  The dumpy white guy surrendered the ball, and shortly thereafter, lost the game.</p>
<p>There was no ref.  There was no walking violation that I saw.  Anyway, those of you who have played pick up basketball know that walking violations are rarely called.  Anyway, in this game, the athletic black guy palmed the ball most of the time.</p>
<p>When I saw this, I had to turn away.  &#8220;How black,&#8221; I said to myself. </p>

		<p>Duke basketball continues to be a mostly white team year-in and year-out. The fact is, lots of the big-time programs (Georgetown, UConn, Memphis State, most of the SEC schools) often have all-black teams or maybe one white substitute. They obviously only recruit blacks and believe that blacks are better athletes.</p>
<p>Top-level white basketball players have fewer options so when you have schools like Duke, Notre Dame, Wisconsin, Butler, Stanford &hellip;etc that are open to white kids they tend to get better players.</p>

		<p>When we say we &#8220;hate&#8221; you, don&rsquo;t take it too literally. Is that what this is? I cannot say. Jealousy of a perverse nature. What do they know of those whitey players. NOT one kind word at all? As they say, if you can&rsquo;t say something nice about someone &hellip;!</p>

<p>Very illuminating!</p>
<p>So &#8216;America&rsquo; is bad and &#8216;God&rsquo; is bad.</p>
<p>How much clearer can it be that these leftist &#8216;multiculturalists&rsquo; actively hate America? They are openly stating it for all to see.</p>

		<p>Can&rsquo;t say much about college basketball, however blacks are well represented in that thug environment known as college football.  Yesterday, four national champion Auburn players were booted after being arrested for armed burglary. Out of the four, three were black.  I guess the NCAA will be accused of racism, now.  And moronic white Auburn SEC supporters will view this as a some sort of natural tragedy along the lines of the Japanese earthquake.  Unless they are Alabama fans, in which case they will be happy.  <br>
What would whites do without black sports?  Pathetic.</p>

		<p>Very nice to see supposed Black superiority in basketball, football and boxing shot down.</p>
<p>My racial awakening came when I rooted for the White Russian Soviets against the all Black John Thompson coached &#8220;US&#8221; olympic basketball team and I also rooted for the White Russian Soviet army in their invasion of Afghanistan in the late 1970s, fighting the same brutal NW Muslim moutain throat cutters the US is fighting now.</p>
<p>Is everyone here familiar with the great website caste football?</p>
<p>Despite strong discriminiation against White athletes, our White boys are doing great in boxing, football and in some spots basketball. And it&rsquo;s OK to root for your own people, just be fair to others and in fairness there are certainly many very good Black athletes, some are even show good sportsmanship</p>

<p>Knowing what I know now, I wish we wouldn&rsquo;t have helped the Afghans resist the Soviet invasion.  We should have stayed neutral, or maybe even helped the Soviets along.  We now know from 20/20 hindsight that our helping the Afghans essentially created OBL and AQ, which came back to bite us more than 20 years later.  </p>
<p>Of course, you can say the same thing in Central America   &mdash;   Our helping Central Americans resist Soviet influence created MS-13, Mara 18, etc., which has come back to bite us.</p>
<p>Point is, our fear of Soviet style communism was (A) irrational, and (B) counterproductive.  My personal rule of foreign policy is never to side with a non-white country, power, principality or potentate over a white country, no matter how abhorrent I find the public policies of the other white country.</p>

		<p> Question Diversity-In your first comment you state that Duke doesn&rsquo;t recruit basketball players, black or white, that couldn&rsquo;t get into Duke purely on academic credentials. Surely you don&rsquo;t believe that-there aren&rsquo;t enough male blacks that make over 1450 on the old SAT to field a basketball team in the entire nation. And I imagine they cut talented white athletes some slack academically as well-don&rsquo;t be naive.</p>

<p>I was trying to point this out to a number of people as far back as the Vietnam War.  After 1975, many Vietnamese refugees formed gangs in LA. This was the start of the new rise in gang culture.  Everything you wrote here is true.  I constantly got called a &#8220;Commie&#8221; for pointing the likely results out.  (If they had just done a little homework, our fearless leaders would have realized that the Vietnamese hated the Chinese or anyone else who might try to take over their country.  They defeated China&rsquo;s bid to take over after we left).  The Soviet Union was a threat, but our responses were over-reactive and created more harm than good.  The late historian Carrol Quigley pointed out in his epic 20th century history, &#8220;Tragedy and Hope,&#8221; that during the McCarthy trials the Soviet Union was probably at its least dangerous state as Stalin was aging and going after his own people.  Still, we created and did tremendous harm to ourselves and actually created our own homegrown enemies and actually directly gave rise to the social mess of the 1960s that still punishes us today.  And this was, by the way, all the doings of that so called, &#8220;Greatest Generation.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can thank a Polish joke named Zbigniew Brzezinski, for the situation in Afghanistan. He was Carter&rsquo;s national security adviser, and thought that Al Qaeda was preferable to the Soviets in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>To  Jack in Chicago:</p>
<p>I watched one boxing match from the Beijing Olympics, and was rooting for an Italian boxer v. an American black. Over and over, the announcers kept talking about how the black had an autistic daughter, and he was a truck driver supporting her. The black wound up losing on decision. I felt good, as I did not consider him an American, but an African on American soil.<br>

		<p>17 Soprano Fan:  I don&rsquo;t think AQ existed in &#8216;79.  All the eventual players did, but AQ really didn&rsquo;t materialize until the early 80s.  Still, I am hardly a Ziggy Brzezinski fan.  And if he made any statements that implied that fundamentalist Muslims of either Arab or non-Arab variety were preferable to white people, even extreme left-wing white people, then he was worse than worthless.</p>
<p>16 Whiteplight:  Another example of my point:  Vietnamese.  Just about every one of them in the United States now is a direct consequence of our being involved in Vietnam to &#8220;fight communism.&#8221;  And while one can do a lot worse when it comes to racial minorities, still, it contributes to (cutting royalty check to Jupiter) the dispossession of native born white Americans in their own country.</p>
<p>I too read &#8220;Tragedy and Hope.&#8221;  The USSR was many bad things, but at least it was a known quantity.  And white.  Actually, the most profound thing I took away from that book is that Western Civilization should be thought of as something different and separate, albeit related, to Greco-Roman civilization and Slavic civilization.  Most intellectuals consider them all samey-same.  </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you feel this way, but I personally don&rsquo;t give Reagan as much credit for the fall of the Soviet Union and its protectorate quasi-empire that most do.  Part of it was inevitability, and I certainly don&rsquo;t give Margaret Thatcher any credit   &mdash;   We found out later she vehemently resisted the German reunification (which was technically the Federal Republic of Germany (&#8220;West Germany&#8221;) annexing the former German Democratic Republican (&#8220;East Germany&#8221;))  Because she didn&rsquo;t get her way, this emboldened those in non-Russian SSRs within the USSR.  I guess, in spite of all her mouthing off about the &#8220;evils of communism,&#8221; she hated Germans more than the Soviets.</p>

		<p>On this topic, Oregon State didn&rsquo;t make the tournament, again.  For the third time in a row.  So, for the last three tourneys, Craig Robinson has been the head coach and his brother-in-law has been President of the United States.  And nothing to show for either.</p>
<p>Funny, you would have thought all these blue chip black high school basketball players would have been beating down the door to play their college ball in Corvallis, Oregon, as an offshoot of the Obama Effect, i.e. black children were all supposed to do better in school.</p>
<p>Some time this week, we&rsquo;ll get the de rigueur story about the poor graduation rates among hoopsters in the 68 teams that comprise this year&rsquo;s tournament, and the racial differences therein.  Quoting Richard Lapchick and his Institute for Diversity and Ethics (not to mention oxymorons) in Sports.  The other groundhog day time of a year for this happening is in mid-December or so, when the BCS college football teams are announced.</p>

		<p>The only thing the blacks have is what the white man has given them.  If they are so great, if they are the bone of civilization, how come they have built nothing on their own apart from pain, misery, miscreants, why don&rsquo;t they have something we want to be part of? we demand to be allowed in? they have nothing.</p>
<p>Chris Rock said it, &#8220;I&rsquo;m rich and yet no white man would want to be me&#8221;.  </p>
<p>We have given and given because they are needy and unqualified to get it on their own.  For the blacks who can&hellip;God bless you and your family, welcome to shared misery by the others.</p>

		<p>I have followed the Duke basketball team since I could walk.  What intrigues me the most, is that in the last 31 years there have only been about 40 players that went to the NBA.  That means the majority of the players on the team actually get jobs.  Also, almost every player in the last several years have come from a good prep school and not from a slum or ghetto.</p>
<p>Lastly, what I like so much about Duke, is that they play team basketball (also known as &#8220;white ball&#8221;).  It is far different than &#8220;black basketball&#8221; which consists of 8 people standing around while 2 players play one on one.</p>

		<p>I saw two of the players on ESPN this morning &#8220;live&#8221; still talking about their hate for Duke&hellip;and it being because they felt Duke was soft and suburban. Can you imagine Duke players 20 years later saying they hated the ghetto and ethnic makeup of the Fab 5. I think most blacks cry racism to project their own racist attitudes. Same way a man that cheats on his wife always suspects his wife is cheating.</p>
