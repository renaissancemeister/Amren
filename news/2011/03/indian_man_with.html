			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Telegraph (London), February 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>They all live in a four storied building with 100 rooms in a mountainous village in Mizoram state, sharing borders with Burma and Bangladesh, according to reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;I once married 10 women in one year,&#8221; Ziona Chana said.</p>
<p>His wives share a dormitory near Ziona&rsquo;s private bedroom and locals said he likes to have seven or eight of them by his side at all times.</p>
<p>The sons and their wives, and all their children, live in different rooms in the same building, but share a common kitchen.</p>
<p>The wives take turns cooking, while his daughters clean the house and do washing. The men do outdoor jobs like farming and taking care of livestock.</p>
<p>The family, all 167 of them, consumes around 200lb of rice and more than 130lb of potatoes a day. They are supported by their own resources and occasional donations from followers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even today, I am ready to expand my family and willing to go to any extent to marry,&#8221; Ziona said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have so many people to care (for) and look after, and I consider myself a lucky man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr Chana met his oldest wife, who is three years older than he is, when he was 17.</p>
<p>He heads a local Christian religious sect, called the &#8220;Chana&#8221;, which allows polygamy. Formed in June 1942, the sect believes it will soon be ruling the world with Christ and has a membership of around 400 families.</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s not in our country.  He stays in his own.  They provide for themselves, no welfare or handouts.  As long as the way they provide for themselves is not some Roma system of fraud, theft and extortion, I have no problem with this guy or his Christian cult - IF they stay where they are and NOT come to a country which has laws against polygamy.<br>
That bozo could bankrupt a city through welfare payments just to his &#8220;family&#8221; members.</p>

Mormon plural marriage is &#8220;known&#8221; in the larger American society by its troubling exceptions rather than by its quiet successes  &mdash;  <br>
i.e., by &#8220;Man Bits Dog&#8221; sensationalism.  I hazard the speculation  &mdash;  no apology intended  &mdash;  that IF Jeffs was involved with underage women, it might have been a misguided effort to initiate and emotionally bond them into some ceremonial and religious-value framework to help prevent their being randomly deflowered in ways conventional to our larger lust-enveloped  society ?? The El Dorado, Texas(Jeffs ) raid revealed rather little disaffection among the &#8220;traditional&#8221; Mormom women there.<br>

I have, a family of hindi-speaking north indians that considered themselves &#8220;whiter&#8221; than southern indians. the younger woman of the family did not like me, likely because I am blonde, blue-eyed, and while she had to work cleaning motel rooms, I am a housewife; with a husband who provides more than hers.<br>
they were &#8220;from&#8221; Texas, and did not expect French speaking Cajuns,in addition to the English and Spanish. (they greatly disliked blacks)</p>

		<p>I wonder how &#8216;Indian&rsquo; this man really is: he&rsquo;s from Eastern India, and as the pictures can show you, the people from this region are ethnically, genetically, and linguistically similar to Thais and Burmese.  It would be a bit like a Chinese doing something horrid in the US, and them saying an &#8216;American&rsquo; man passed secrets to the PRC.</p>

		<p>Polygamy should be only for the best of men, those men being the ones who expand their nation through some great deeds, as most men should get all the children they want with one wife.</p>
<p>Incest in a eugenic perspective may be desirable among certain families; afterall, who would not like their family to look like them even after a considerable number of generations have passed. A viable pairing could be considered between every third cousin. I&rsquo;ll explain, you could marry your great-great uncle&rsquo;s great-great grandchild and you would have a child much more similar to yourself, yet the total variable genetic stock to choose from among the parents is not so dangerously small that hereditary diseases etcetera could not be flushed out through the sea of the vigorous national population. Every family is like a river flowing into the national people.</p>
<p>Overpopulation as easily observed among the pet dog populations of large metropolitan areas allows the now vast amount of weaker dogs to breed which continues washing the population through a torrent of malign diseases. Humans are not free from such phenomenon of nature.</p>

<p>The Northeast part of India is geographically easily distinguishable from the rest of the India.  It is connected to the rest of the India by a thin sliver of territory called the Chicken&rsquo;s Neck.<br>

The social and economic security most women instinctively &#8220;factor in&#8221; to their reproductive choices seems to shape most quiet and successful polygamy.  When it was practiced without legal proscription in Utah, most people remained monogamous.  On balance, it appears to have been very eugenic and only occasionally dysgenic.</p>

		<p>Big Tribe Effect.</p>
<p>You rule the resource allocations by buying in lots (or bullying that way) and suddenly you are a local power, simply because you are unified group whose resource sharing is efficiency driven through maximized labor production and minimalist individualism.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this nation is headed towards if the blacks ever stay out of jail long enough of or the mestizos ever get past 35% of the nation.</p>
<p>Asians do it smarter.  But the psychology is the same.</p>
<p>ONLY in Europe, where snows and cold meant one man and his family were better off with a lot of land and little competition, did we learn to improvise a loosely interconnected society based on social altruism: &#8216;have a skill, trade a wife, keep the genes clean!&rsquo;.</p>
<p>No race anywhere else has managed this and India is the prime example of why it&rsquo;s dumb to import the problem.</p>

		<p>It is indeed difficult to imagine pre-historic human evolution in which today&rsquo;s conventional Western monogamy was prevalent among the leaders of the groups that surmounted evolution&rsquo;s challenges.<br>
Today, sexual fidelity to just one woman is probably more the exception than the rule among men at a level of social and financial success at which the choice becomes clear.</p>

<p>You are wrong. The article is not pointless. It is a refelection of the rate at which third worlders are breeding, during a time when whites are suffering demographic decline. Some of that man&rsquo;s children may end up in America on H1B visas, or through the green card lottery system.</p>
<p>We have to confront the fact that the white population is shrinking, in both America and Europe. In a 2008 article, Pat Buchanan revealed that the global white population will shrink by 200 million, by the year 2060. https://www.vdare.com/buchanan/080501_population.htm</p>
<p>America and Europe are soon going to experience a severe labor shortage, because of their shrinking populations. Do you think that the capitalists who control America and Europe will allow their profits to fall, when there are millions of young workers in the third world?</p>
<p>The people mentioned in the above article are the future citizens of the United States and Europe, who will be the majority in those countries whose people are shrinking, because of their failure to reproduce themselves.</p>

		<p>Just curious, BJohnson : If the population of whites are shrinking&hellip;.who is to blame for our demise ? Indians ? Other non white groups ? Jews ? Nope. The fault lies with our own stupidity. Our lifestyle speaks volumes. Ironically, most whites in the west do not emulate the typical Christian or Mormon family values so prevalent in the mid-west, south and mountain region of the United States. What you sow, so shall ye reap! In my humble opinion, this Indian man is a real success in terms of evolution. The point of this article is an ironic twist on our stupidity where crass materialism, instant gratification and our overwhelming sense of entitlement has made us see days like these and even much worse in the future. God help us!</p>
