<h1>Black Community&rsquo;s Reaction to Hartsfield Charges Mixed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Hewlett, Winston-Salem Journal, March 22, 2011  </i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If the allegations that Forsyth District Judge Denise Hartsfield fixed traffic tickets and lied to investigators are true, she should be held accountable, some residents said Monday.</p>
<p>But some in the black community said they think Hartsfield, who is black, was targeted by someone and is being railroaded by a criminal-justice system that is unfair to minorities.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Mendez, pastor of Emmanuel Baptist Church and a local community activist who is black, said he thinks Hartsfield was targeted by someone who wanted to get her in trouble. He said it could have been for political reasons, such as thinking she&rsquo;s soft on crime. He said he could not rule out race as a motivation because he sees a national climate that is hostile to black politicians, from the White House to judges.</p>
<p>He said he thinks Hartsfield is no more unethical than other district court judges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other judges may be doing it, but nobody leaked it on them,&#8221; Mendez said.</p>
<p>Hartsfield is getting strong support from her church, St. Paul United Methodist Church. When the Rev. Donald Jenkins, the church&rsquo;s pastor, talked Sunday about how proud he is of Hartsfield, church members stood up and clapped.</p>
<p>Jenkins told the congregation that satanic elements must be working against people like Hartsfield who care about others, or they wouldn&rsquo;t find themselves in a &#8220;certain newspaper,&#8221; apparently referring to the Winston-Salem Journal.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Journal reported Friday that the N.C. Judicial Standards Commission filed a statement of charges against Hartsfield on March 1, alleging that she had engaged in a &#8220;continuing pattern of conduct in which she entered beneficial judgments for certain defendants.&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement cited 22 cases in which Hartsfield is alleged to &#8220;have allowed social and other relationships to influence her judicial conduct or judgment,&#8221; leading her to fix traffic tickets so that the defendants didn&rsquo;t pay fines.</p>
<p>She also fixed tickets for defendants added to her docket by court staff, with the understanding that she would enter favorable judgments, according to the statement. She entered the judgments without the defendant, or the defendant&rsquo;s attorney, appearing in court in cases where that is not allowed, according to the allegations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Walter Marshall, a Forsyth County commissioner who is black, said Monday that he believes Hartsfield was targeted, though he does not know whether that has anything to do with her race. He thinks other judges do the same things that Hartsfield is accused of doing. He said the entire criminal-justice system is unfair and has punished blacks more harshly than whites.</p>
<p>Mendez agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ve seen white kids commit crimes similar to black kids, but if they&rsquo;re not of a certain economic status or from a privileged (background), the poor black kids will be prosecuted and the white kids will be released,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&rsquo;re not talking about a fair system down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others said Monday that if Hartsfield is guilty, she should be held accountable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law is the law is the law,&#8221; said Valerie Barnes, who is black. &#8220;She has a reasonable amount of intelligence or she wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten as far as she did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ben Jones, who is black, said black politicians are more scrutinized than others, and Hartsfield should have been aware of that.</p>
<p>He said racial prejudice still exists, but Hartsfield is also considered innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish the truth would come out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would put a lot of things to rest.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thomas Jefferson is quoted as having said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people [blacks] are to be free. Nor is it less certain that the two races, equally free, cannot live in the same government. Nature, habit, opinion has drawn indelible lines of distinction between them.&#8221; Thomas Jefferson: </p>
<p>He was right.</p>

<p>Wow, what high aspirations blacks seem to have for their kind.</p>
<p>And of course, the truth is that black officials are most certainly more corrupt than their white counterparts.  They feel entitled, you see.  They are there to take, not to contribute.<br>

		<p>If she wasn&rsquo;t fixing tickets then there wouldn&rsquo;t be a case. Blacks in public life are held to a lower, not higher, standard and glide by although they&rsquo;re generally more corrupt and mediocre on average. They always say others are doing it too, therefore things are unfair. That&rsquo;s like saying I should be let go after getting caught for bank robbery because there are others out there who have gotten away with it.</p>

<p>So, it wasn&rsquo;t her favoritism that was the problem, according to Rev. Cracker Jack Box here.  She wasn&rsquo;t doing anything wrong, it&rsquo;s just that &#8220;someone&#8221; just out of the blue &#8220;wanted to get her in trouble.&#8221;  So she didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong in as much as the authorities wanted to punish her for doing something wrong.</p>
<p>That vast nefarious conspiracy would have all been thwarted if Ms. Hartsfield would have never done anything wrong.</p>

		<p>Many Blacks think their bruthers and sisters are put in jail just because they are Black added to that thought,there are too many Blacks in jailSo anything, anything they can do to keep one more Black from paying a ticket or going to jail she is all for it.If her superiors are smart they will investigate previous cases.She looks like she has a mouth on her and could be loud and imperious.</p>

		<p>Most black Americans do not support corrupt black politicians, because it is black Americans who pay the price for the antics of these self-absorbs manipulators, who belong to a larger group of white and hispanic corrupt political manipulators who hide behind their respective ethnic groups when they get caught. </p>
<p>I would expect that this woman&rsquo;s church would support her in some way, but that does not mean that the average African American reading about her situation would automatically gloss over her alleged unethical behavior. </p>

<p>Ha Ha Ha.  </p>
<p>This is where we need to laugh in their faces!  (Alinsky&rsquo;s Rule #5:   &#8220;Ridicule is man&rsquo;s most potent weapon!&#8221;)</p>
<p>If the journalist were doing his job:</p>
<p>He would bring up the Duke &#8220;rape&#8221; case or the blatant Voter Intimidation case in Philly, reminding the black community  as to how it is WHITES who being railroaded by a criminal-justice system that is unfair to them.</p>
<p>(DO NOT USE THE WORD &#8220;MINORITY&#8221; TO REFER TO NON-WHITES !!) because in many parts of the country WHITES are the minority.</p>
<p>This also deserves laugh-in-your-face ridicule:</p>
<p><i>He said he could not rule out race as a motivation because he sees a national climate that is hostile to black politicians, from the White House to judges.</i></p>
<p>If the journalist were doing his job:</p>
<p>He would mention as to how the &#8220;messiah&#8221; Obama receives pass after pass after pass from a fawning media (afforded to NO WHITE politician) as he vacations in Rio, endlessly golfs away his time, and wrings his hands over hugely important issues such as &#8220;bullying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Walter Marshall said he believes Hartsfield was targeted.. He thinks other judges do the same things that Hartsfield is accused of doing. He said the entire criminal-justice system is unfair and has punished blacks more harshly than white.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the journalist were doing his proper job:</p>
<p>He would issue an immediate challenge to Marshall to present his proof of &#8220;other judges doing the same thing.&#8221;  And ask if he thought the Duke case were handled fairly, ask if the rape accuser, Crystal Gail Magnum, should have been let off as she was instead of facing harsh charges, as she should have, for lying to the point of ruining several lives. Ask if the Black Panthers should have been punished for intimidating whites with clubs at a polling venue.  Ask black &#8220;leaders&#8221; and &#8220;reverends&#8221; as to whether those constitute  double-standards or not.</p>
<p>If the journalist were doing his job:</p>
<p>He would immediately call out any blacks who make unfounded, hypocritical pronouncements such as: &#8220;the criminal system is racist&#8221;, &#8220;only targeted because of race&#8221; or &#8220;others are doing the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just as he would call out any white politician for denouncement and ridicule who aired such things as black on white crime figures, black failure or black hypocrisy. <br>

		<p> The reporter was like a butcher with his thumb on the scale: He interviewed only blacks, all but inviting them to say, &#8220;She was targeted because she&rsquo;s black.&#8221; Wouldn&rsquo;t it have been more fair to interview a cross-section of the community of all races?  But then, that probably wouldn&rsquo;t have produced the story that the reporter wanted.</p>
<p> Also note that the comments section has been shut down and the comments hidden, on the original story. That&rsquo;s a sure sign that many posters were outraged with both the judge and the blacks who engaged in knee-jerk defense of her.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of former Judge Herman Thomas in Mobile, Alabama, who was having sex with black male inmates in exchange for amending their sentences. The black population stood/stands behind him. Although, in the black cummunity, rape and sex for services is not looked at as victimization. It is an accepted form of currency. </p>
