<h1>GOP Eyes Black Vote in 2012</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Risen, Florida Courier, March 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With two Black Republicans among the Republican freshman class, the GOP is looking into ways it can expand support from the Black community in 2012.</p>
<p>It will be tough: the party has to sell its efforts to repeal health care reform and limit unemployment benefits to a population wracked by joblessness and with a history of supporting such programs. </p>
<p>But Rep. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Rep. Allen West (R.-FL) expect disenchantment with the economy coupled with support for socially conservative issues can build a foundation for the GOP in the African-American community for 2012, and beyond. Speaking before the Conservative Political Action Conference on last month, West denounced perceptions that the GOP is racist as part of the &#8220;politics of character assassination.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Scott also believed the GOP can claim diversity and seek a more multicultural voter base, thanks to a recent crop of minority Republican politicians. Yet, Scott also recognized that the Democratic Party&rsquo;s ties to the Black community will be difficult to dislodge while the Republican Party is pitching a return to limited government. Since the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 Black voters have often and overwhelmingly voted in favor of Democratic candidates. </p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;ll have to spend a lot of money and we&rsquo;ll need a good communications strategy against an Obama campaign that will attract a lot of young people and minorities,&#8221; said Scott. &#8220;But if the Black vote remains locked at more than 90 percent for Democrats in 2012, people will think the Black vote is not in play, which will weaken its impact on American politics.&#8221; </p>
<p>While West joined the Democratic-leaning Congressional Black Caucus at the start of the 112th Congress, Scott declined. Scott explained to NNPA that while he hoped to work with the Caucus on economic development and education, he did not expect the Congressional group to shift party allegiances in the near future, despite socially conservative leanings among Black voters.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Black people vote their issues, they will vote Republican more often than not, but it&rsquo;s very difficult to overcome the emotional connection to something, even if the facts of their decision don&rsquo;t line up with the intent,&#8221; said Scott. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The February jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor indicated Black unemployment is at 15.3 percent, which is the highest of any demographic in the country. With the Black community struggling to find working-class jobs, West has advocated stricter immigration enforcement as a chief plank for the 2012 campaign. </p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at immigration it is a multi-headed hydra. It is an economic issue, it is an education issue, a national security issue, it&rsquo;s a health care issue and it&rsquo;s a local criminality issue,&#8221; West told NNPA. &#8220;We have to start looking at it that way, and not allowing people to pigeonhole us into thinking that we&rsquo;re xenophobic, because that&rsquo;s not the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Affordable Health Care Act is also in the crosshairs for spending cuts sought by Scott and West. Alice Rivlin, a senior economist with the Brookings Institute, said GOP efforts to cut or repeal the law would &#8220;make gaining the Black vote difficult&#8221; for the GOP in 2012 because more than 30 million low-income voters in the Black and Latino community have benefited from its coverage.</p>

		<p>Every election cycle is supposedly the one in which the black vote will be in play for the GOP.  Inevitably, pandering to black issues turns out to be a completely useless expenditure of political capital.  Blacks are not a swing vote.  The 5% of blacks that do hold sensible political views didn&rsquo;t arrive at them because of  racial pandering.  Forget blacks, focus on the much larger proportion of browns that are reachable, focus on winning more white women, stop alienating white non-religious and pro-civil liberties voters, and the GOP could be a majority party.</p>

		<p>As usual, the GOP is tilting at windmills, doing double somersaults in search of a small uptick in black support and resulting self-flattery.  How about instead going the extra mile for the vote that dares not speak its name, especially in Washington, D.C.   &mdash;   the white vote!</p>

		<p>The fact is, the vast majority of blacks are poorly educated - so they are going to go to the party they think will give them the most benefits for free.  That, obviously, would be the Democrats.  The Dems gave them free welfare 40 years ago, and the blacks have not forgotten that.  They look to the Dems as they once looked to Massa - with their hands stretched out, palms up, in front of them.  As that one obviously ignorant black lady said about Obama, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t care where the money come from - Obama goan&rsquo; give me money!!&#8221;  And that about sums it up.  Republicans aren&rsquo;t going to get very far with people like that.</p>

		<p>The only character assassination going on here is that of the Republicans towards themselves.</p>
<p>Political victory by statistical inclusion/exclusionism is the equivalent of pawn warfare in chess.  Gain one of their&rsquo;s and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you knock off one of yours because &#8220;The road is clear!&#8221; for the advancement to victory.</p>
<p>Which is to say that victory without political determinism as a consciousness of personal, racial and social ethics is an empty achievement at best.  If you cannot find it in yourself to give unto those what you promised you should not make &#8216;political compromises&rsquo; which gain their support at the cost of trust and respect among your own.</p>
<p>Because not only will you have both parties hating you but you build distrust in the system itself.</p>
<p>This is why I look at politics the same way I look at women: as social accomodators who achieve &#8216;victory&rsquo; as fulfillment of genetic driven survival psychology, by being willing to support the underdogs who represent an outside skill set or resource.</p>
<p>The problem is that women are driven to this &#8216;victims ally with victims&rsquo; nonsense by physical, mental and reproductive specific traits of their gender.  They are the ones who get to choose which genes flow into our collective future.  And so keeping the lines open and fresh is a necessary evil.</p>
<p>Politicians have no such excuse.  They do not improve the quality of the social body by inviting weakness in and sponsoring it to strengths beyon that of the indigene population.  They merely gain short term allegiances which spoil the ultimate future survival odds of their parent groups.</p>
<p>We have got to stop treating democracy as an LCD attempt to buy in the greatest number of trusting fools as a majority.  That is it&rsquo;s inherent flaw: idiots that reach across boundaries (screwing their own to exploit others) magnify weakness by seeking to reduce all points of view to a plurality of minorities as the definition of constrictionist wisdom.</p>
<p>It is _not_.</p>
<p>Wisdom simply exists.  Some groups have more.  And by letting those groups achieve and sustain the dominance they have earned _as a racially heritable edge_ the also-rans get a free ride.</p>
<p>Forget this need for loyalty to a dominant, productive, group and you can kiss organized, participative, society goodbye.</p>

		<p>Haven&rsquo;t we heard this refrain from Republicans before?  I can never figure out if they are stupid enough to REALLY believe they can get more than 10% of the black vote, or if they are using these arguments in order to reassure &#8220;moderate&#8221; white voters who are black sympathizers.  So which is it?  Either way, Republicans are useless.</p>

		<p>You can only get so much of the black vote before you have to start giving the shaft to whites in order to get some more votes.  Blacks hate whites and like to see them get screwed for being white.    The democrats are already masters of that game.  Why does the GOP think they can mine that depleted vein any better? </p>

		<p>While there are a few sensible conservative blacks, let&rsquo;s face it, they are always going to be a small minority of blacks.  Most blacks believe that the purpose of government is to take stuff from whites and give it to blacks.  That is in line with the Democratic philosophy.  Jesse Jackson Jr.&rsquo;s recent speech on the House floor exemplifies that philosophy.  He&rsquo;ll get a lot more black votes than Allen West ever will.<br>

		<p>The GOP never tires of this ridiculous game. Every one of these &#8216;outreach&rsquo; attempts always turns into an inevitable failure and embarrassment. </p>
<p>We are constantly told that black community is &#8216;really conservative&rsquo; and that  they have been &#8216;fooled&rsquo; by the liberals.</p>
<p>Exactly what issue are they conservative on? They have the highest percentage on government welfare programs, highest incarceration rate, abortion rate, out of wedlock birthrate, etc. etc.  </p>

		<p>Let me make sure I understand this, &#8220;by acting more like sheila jackson lee&#8221; the gop expects to get black votes?  Does character count anymore?  By taking a lunch with race baiters like sharpton or jackson votes are expected to be bought?  </p>
<p>Does anyone have core values that can never be violated?  Can truth stand on it&rsquo;s own&hellip;allow the truth to stand even if this corrupt and nilistic government and people disappear.</p>

<p>Yeah, right, lets bring in more browns, so that 70% of them can reliably vote for Democrats every elecion. Hispandering never works. It&rsquo;s like trying to make up for a loss by increasing the volume. It&rsquo;ll only hasten our demise.</p>

		<p>Though I&rsquo;ve never seen a study or survey supporting this, I strongly suspect that low IQ people, whatever their race, vote overwhelmingly Democratic.  American blacks, with a mean IQ of 85, will always vote for the Democrats.  It&rsquo;s futile for Republican pols to waste their time and resources trying to attract black voters; there&rsquo;s simply no significant return on that investment.  And those accomplished blacks out there, and there are a good many of them, are already Republicans.</p>
<p>Politics, sad to say, is mainly a game of percentages.</p>

		<p>I guess the Republicans really are that stupid to think they can siphon off a substantial portion of black voters from Obama. Conservatives and Republicans tell us all the time that race doesn&rsquo;t matter yet they will be making overt racial appeals to attract black voters.</p>
<p>Their efforts will end in failure as Obama will garner no less than 92% of the black vote regardless of how much ebonics the white Republicans speak in their vain attempts to win the hearts and minds of a very anti-white black America. </p>

		<p>The Stupid Party will either become the party of white self-interest or be doomed to lose it&rsquo;s base of white support the same way the Democrats did. Libertarian candidates (that support closed borders) could gain seats via white support by promoting legislation that guts the welfare state and disparate impact bills benefiting non-whites at our expense.  </p>
