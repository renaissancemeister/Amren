<h1>Senate Rejects Bill to End Immigrant Licenses</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barry Massey, Santa Fe New Mexican, March 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In a political setback for Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, the Senate rejected a politically charged proposal Wednesday night to stop New Mexico from issuing driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 24-17 against a proposal by Republican Sen. John Ryan of Albuquerque that would have ended the practice of granting licenses to foreign nationals without a Social Security number.</p>
<p>Two Democrats  &mdash;  John Arthur Smith of Deming and Tim Eichenberg of Albuquerque  &mdash;  broke party ranks and joined Republicans in backing the proposal.</p>
<p>The governor, who took office in January, vowed during her gubernatorial campaign to end the state&rsquo;s licensing policy enacted during former Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Democrats said the move to end immigrant licenses was politically motivated and targeted Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is basically a bill that is very biased against Mexican nationals,&#8221; said Sen. Richard Martinez, D-Española. &#8220;Actually, I think the bill is a political key for our governor to run for something else or to run for election.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats said New Mexico&rsquo;s licensing law has improved public safety by requiring immigrants to get insurance for their vehicles and placing information about immigrant drivers in a governmental database, which is available to authorities if they need to serve arrest warrants. The license policy also has lessened immigrant fears of reporting crimes and cooperating with police, supporters said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Immigrant applicants for a driver&rsquo;s license don&rsquo;t need a Social Security number as part of their identification. Instead, they can submit a taxpayer identification number issued by the federal government along with other identification, such as a passport and a Matricula Consular card issued by a Mexican consulate.</p>
<p>Three states  &mdash;  New Mexico, Washington and Utah  &mdash;  allow illegal immigrants to get licenses because their laws do not require proof of citizenship. {snip}<br>

		<p>Well, good then.  Let all states refuse to recognize NM driver licenses, but at the same time publicize that those three states do not require citizenship.  Then those states without such a law, pass a law stating that you MUST be a LEGAL citizen to get a state license.  One more reason for all the illegals to flee OUR states and flood those three states.  Let  THOSE three states drown in the brown flood they welcome, and let US stay free from illegals.  Reciprocal recognition of state driver licenses is a courtesy.  Not a requirement.  Not a lawyer, but that&rsquo;s what I believe.  If all states refuse to recognize NM licenses, just as some states refuse to recognize concealed carry licenses of some other states due to not being strict enough in requirements, then maybe NM will have a &#8220;come to Jesus&#8221; moment.  Or not.  Either way, we win.<br>

		<p>I wonder if the atates that give driver&rsquo;s licenses to illegal ever read the many accounts of innocent people killed by illegal aliens driving drunk? Sadly, we seem to have lost a sense of right and wrong in this country, or perhaps it&rsquo;s our sense of patriotism. This is clearly aiding and abetting the criminals who slither across our border. Once they present any sort of false/stolen documents to work, they have committed a felony. So, I&rsquo;m sure even illegals are asked for some sort of ID to purchase a car (surely not what Americans must produce), then the seller of a car or those who supply licenses are bargaining with known felons. Is this really the kind of country we live in now? I guess I can answer my own question.</p>

		<p>Illegals are not immigrants, they are alien criminals.  If they were blocked at the border as they should be or otherwise deported upon identification, the issue of drivers licenses or other services for illegals would not be a concern&hellip; and our politicians could actually do work on behalf of the citizens of the nation instead of taking non-action and thus ensuring our national destruction.  Governor Martinez has it partly correct, in that the bill is biased against -ILLEGAL- MEXICAN NATIONALS.  Actually, it is biased against ALL NON-LEGAL persons and biased in favor of those LEGALLY IN THE U.S., which is how it should be. That the bill didn&rsquo;t pass is not a surprise.</p>

		<p>Democrats support giving drivers licenses to illegals because of motor voter laws.  When these people get a drivers license, they simply have to check a box and they&rsquo;re automatically registered to vote.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder why Democrats support motor voter laws, allowing people to vote without showing an ID, ACORN, and forcing workers to join unions and pay monthly union dues?  Take these four things away and Democrats would never again be the majority party in Congress, nor would they ever win the presidency.  They require manipulation and corruption just to compete.</p>

<p>Using similar logic we should hand out CCW Permits to all Mexican criminals carrying guns. I am sure it would make streets safer.</p>

<p>I live in Washington State, and let me tell you, we are ALREADY drowning in illegals! Nobody will publicize the numbers, because of our panty-waist Ms. Governor and senators and congresswomen  &mdash;  hellbent flaming liberal feminists every one of them  &mdash;  but MANY eastern Washington counties are at or past the 50% mark of illegal invaders, most of whom are some type of Hispanics. The majority of them are Mexicans, but there is a goodly number of  those from various South American countries as well. </p>

		<p>The liberal Dems are just trying to keep their power by making their voters happy. What they fail to understand is once Hispanics become a majority they will turn on them. Once in power they will promote their agenda at the expense of the foolish whites who helped them gain everything. </p>
