			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matthew Balan, Media Research Center, March 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Mark Potok of the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center claimed on Monday&rsquo;s Newsroom on CNN that radical Islam wasn&rsquo;t &#8220;our biggest domestic terror threat,&#8221; that instead, &#8220;that pretty clearly comes from the radical right in this country.&#8221; Anchor Suzanne Malveaux touted Potok as &#8220;expert on extremism&#8221; from &#8220;one of the most highly regarded non-governmental operations that are monitoring hate groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malveaux brought on the SPLC spokesman at the bottom of the 12 noon Eastern hour to discuss the upcoming hearings by the House Homeland Security Committee on the radicalization of American Muslims. The anchor first asked him, &#8220;From your study of tracking radical groups, potentially hate groups, what do you think of this hearing? Is al Qaeda radicalizing Muslims? Is that our biggest homegrown terrorism threat right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>POTOK: Well, I think it&rsquo;s not our biggest domestic terror threat. I think that pretty clearly comes from the radical right in this country, although I would certainly not minimize the threat of jihadist terrorism in this country. Obviously, we have seen a fair amount of it. But what is completely false is, first of all, the idea that Peter King has repeatedly said, that most Muslims are good Americans and so on. You know, in fact what he has said is that 85 percent or 90 percent of the imams running mosques in this country are radical. They&rsquo;re jihadists, and everything suggests that what he says is false. He has also suggested that Muslims are not cooperating with law enforcement, and, you know, we work very closely at the Southern Poverty Law Center with law enforcement officials, and that is absolutely not what they&rsquo;re saying. They&rsquo;re saying they&rsquo;re getting a great deal of cooperation, and in fact, something close to half of the jihadist terror attempts that is have occurred in this country since 9/11 were found out, in fact, because of Muslim informants.</p>
<p>{snip} Potok went on to specify which of these groups or movements concerned him the most:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>POTOK: Sure. Let me say I do think [terrorism is] a significant threat. I don&rsquo;t mean to minimize it, but there are even larger threats out there. An example, to respond to your question, is within the so-called anti-government patriot movement, what we used to think of as the militia movement back in the 1990s. <a href="/news/2007/06/report_says_kkk.html#splc" target="potok" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"><b>There is a whole and rapidly-growing kind of sub movement</a> called the &#8216;sovereign citizens&rsquo; movement.&rsquo;</a> These are people who believe the government has no right to control them in any way, to pass laws that affect them, to require them to pay taxes, even to require things like driver&rsquo;s licenses and auto registrations. Well, you know, on May 20 of last year, a father and son team of these &#8216;sovereign citizens,&rsquo; in fact, murdered two officers, police officers, in West Memphis, Arkansas, and badly wounded two others before being killed themselves. You know, this was at an ordinary traffic stop-</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So, CNN&rsquo;s &#8220;expert&#8221; thinks a movement associated with his one cited incident is somehow a more substantial threat than the Islamism, which has inspired multiple plots and terrorist attacks in this country in recent years.</p>

		<p> More sanctified bilge from the Southern Poverty Lie Center. How many more times do these characters have to be &#8220;caught out&#8221; before even the mainstream media won&rsquo;t have the stomach to give them these forums to spout their hatred of conservatives and race realists?</p>
<p> As I&rsquo;ve said on here before, a good dose of legal action against the SPLC would be the best cure for their self-appointed role as &#8220;hate group designator laureate.&#8221; Won&rsquo;t someone out there please sock it to &#8216;em?</p>

<p>Potok is talking about the Kane family, a bunch of far-left anarchists who went about the country essentially giving seminars to minorities and loser whites about how to defraud banks by means of mortgage fraud, based on the far-leftist notion that big banks and only big banks (FTR:  I assign responsibility evenly between the private financial system and government) are solely and wholly responsible for the financial system collapse in 2008.  Some in the neo-Nazi crowd kinda latched onto the Kanes&rsquo; schemes, because their interest in blaming the banks had to do with also blaming a certain ethnicity that is reputed to be heavily involved in the banking and financial services industry.  But the neo-Nazis were buying into the Kanes&rsquo; screwball schemes, not the other way around.  However, that was the tiny hook that the SPLC used to turn the Kanes into &#8220;right wingers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The occasion of Potok&rsquo;s rant is Peter King&rsquo;s radical Islam hearings.  There are a lot of people protesting them, including Al Sharpton, Keith Ellison and Russell Simmons.  What are all these people afraid of?  What do they have to hide?  Are they afraid (IMHO) that King will pry open their books, put some forensic accountants on the case and discover the money trail that extends back to Saudi Arabia?  Peter King defended his hearings by correctly pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings on the militia movement in late 1995.  The main difference there is that they weren&rsquo;t protesting the very existence of those hearings   &mdash;   Most of them wanted to go, and those that weren&rsquo;t called up to testify were upset.  I remember one of those that did (might have been Mark Korenke) handed Arlen Specter his own business on a platter when he bought up the name Ira Einhorn.  At the time of those hearings, Einhorn was still on the lam, in Europe.  It wasn&rsquo;t until a few years later that the French gendarmes caught up with him.</p>

		<p>Are the sovereign citizens really that big of a concern?  I don&rsquo;t think so.  Did Gordon Kahl and the Kehoe brothers add to their popularity? Again, I don&rsquo;t think so. You have to be a little unstable to begin with to buy into &#8220;redemption theory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is this another way to put a white face on the &#8220;most maligned&#8221; list?  You bet it is.</p>

		<p>OK, Muslims kill 4,000 Americans on 9/11 and plunge the USA into economic crisis, yet the &#8220;radical right&#8221; is a greater threat?</p>
<p>There are small lies and there are big lies, but no one can match Mark Potok and the SPLC, when it comes to lies.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve (tried)to condition most of white America into not being<br>
racist,homophobic,bigoted,anti-Semitic,or xenophobic. They&rsquo;ve imposed white guilt on nearly every ill the world has ever suffered. I think whats really happening is this: dis arm white America, flood our shores with immigrants from the third world, let Jewish bankers and Wall Street Financiers impoverish us, let Washington bureaucrats disenfranchise us, and let the Jihadists  move in to finish off what is left.     </p>

<p>My only problem with Peter King&rsquo;s hearings is that they should have been held nine years ago!  </p>

		<p>There is a reason the radical left fear those that they consider to be the radical right. </p>
<p>Those that they consider to be the radical right may actually have the support of the majority of Americans if the truth is ever known. Western man has always been more or less conservative. The left has had to take power by deceitful methods just like the did in Russia. When in power they eleminate their opposition by any means. </p>

<p>This is true but the SPLC and the hard-left cabal are just front men.  Find out who funds them and leads them.  They are the one&rsquo;s that fear the &#8220;radical right&#8221;, otherwise known as real Americans.</p>

		<p>One problem with stories like these is that the non-SPLC mainstream leftist media have been using the words &#8220;domestic terrorism&#8221; and &#8220;domestic extremism&#8221; or &#8220;homegrown terrorism&#8221; in a confusing way in the last ten years.  Usually, they use these words to refer to American-born non-white Muslims, but on occasion, they also use them to refer to the occasional white right-winger who goes bonkers.  Seems to me there&rsquo;s a deliberate effort to confound the language here.</p>
