<h1>Woodinville Man Pleads Guilty to Attempted Sale of Banned Technology to China</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mike Carter, Seattle Times, March 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 47-year-old Woodinville man pleaded guilty Thursday to conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act by trying to sell sensitive &#8220;radiation-hardened&#8221; military and aerospace technology to China.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said Lian Yang tried to export 300 semiconductors the U.S. government has said have no purpose outside military or aerospace use. They suspect the parts were for use in China&rsquo;s &#8220;next-Gen spaceship program.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yang was arrested in December after he offered to purchase the radiation-hardened semiconductors used by the military in satellites for $700,000 from undercover FBI agents.</p>
<p>Yang and unnamed &#8220;co-conspirators&#8221; deposited a $60,000 down payment in an account set up by the agents, the complaint says.</p>
<p>He was arrested in a sting operation as he was dropping off a $20,000 payment.</p>
<p>Yang came to the FBI&rsquo;s attention when a businessman approached the agency last March after being introduced to Yang by a mutual friend. The businessman, who went on to work as a confidential source, told agents Yang had said he had &#8220;old school friends&#8221; in China who make money importing electronic components from the United States, the complaint says.</p>
<p>The charges say Yang was employed as a consultant at Microsoft and sometimes traveled to China as a recruiter.</p>

		<p>How many does this make so far, covering just the last few years?</p>
<p>By that I mean how many Chinese are helping their countrymen.  I can remember three others in recent times.  </p>
<p>And what about the mestizos on the Border Patrol?  How many of them have held the back door open, so their tribesmnen can get in illegally?</p>
<p>And how many others in the general mestizo poulation actively promote allowing illegals entry no matter how many there are and amnesty for those already here?</p>
<p>Then we have all the Muslim talking heads on T.V. advocating for Jihadists, plus nearly 100% of blacks advocating black causes and interests and ONLY black interests and causes.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s stealing US secrets to give to their homeland, or supporting a program to increase their tribal numbers&hellip;all this in spite of causing a possible collapse of the country&hellip;.huge percentages of every rag tag group that flees to this nation all are guilty of working against the interests of the US.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s their way of showing gratitude for being allowed in.  </p>

		<p>I suspect that this fellow is only noteworthy because he was caught.  The FBI probably make arrests for espionage at the same rate as your local cops do for auto theft.  </p>

		<p>#4,</p>
<p>You got it backwards, what&rsquo;s the penalty for intellectual property theft in China?</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Capital punishment in China can be imposed on crimes against national symbols and treasures, such as theft of cultural relics and (before 1997) the killing of pandas.[7] Corruption, property crimes such as theft, and smuggling gold, silver or other precious metals are also amongst the 68 crimes that are eligible for the death penalty in China.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/SDoyN</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noticing that the Chinese also have capital punishment for recidivist criminals who make the same mistake, twice.  And that they have a very much streamlined system of trial/appeal 1/appeal 2 to go with a &#8216;probationary period&rsquo; optional carrying out of sentence.</p>
<p>With a billion people in their population, they execute 1,700 officially and probably closer to 5-6,000 total, each year.</p>
<p>Since it -should- be possible to moat all sensitive servers (physically remove all networking connections) I&rsquo;m betting that these folks on the ground are used to exploit things like EML addresses of employees etc., after which the job either goes inside via employee (or employee blackmail) or a &#8216;contract offer of interest&rsquo; is made which allows sensitive access to data that is then exploited.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Even though it&rsquo;s not always possible to trace the source of attacks because of IP address spoofing and other techniques, respondents considered China, Russia and Pakistan as the least-safe countries to do business with, according to the survey. The United States, United Kingdom and Germany were considered the safest.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/oOZMo</p>
<p>So once again, nations which built their economies on fair trade and an honor system of contractual agreements are being sucker punched by the &#8216;Rising East&rsquo; because they are too stupid to realize that Asia will _never_ be European in our understanding of social cohesion (integrity) as a way to advance our culture.</p>
<p>Pakistan, China and Russia are the top three offenders when it comes to IT crimes, nobody wants to do business with them.</p>

		<p>Too bad Whites have forgotten what our ancestors knew for centuries. That OUR White blood is thicker than water. Anyway it is suppose to be. Now far too many Whites have &#8220;yellow&#8221; running through their veins.</p>
