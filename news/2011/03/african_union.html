<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The African Union (abbreviated AU in English, and UA in its other official languages) is a union consisting of 53 African states. The only all-African state not in the AU is Morocco (some partly-African European states, such as France and Spain, are not in the AU). Established on 9 July 2002,[4] the AU was formed as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The most important decisions of the AU are made by the Assembly of the African Union, a semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states. The AU&rsquo;s secretariat, the African Union Commission, is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>

		<p>Only two weeks ago I was writing an article about such a lie in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Someone had written on Wikipedia that the western countries are getting more money from Africa because of high interest of banks than they give Africa in aid.</p>
<p>Actually at the same moment I wrote the article, some smarter guy changed it on Wikipedia claiming there would be no statistics for that and most official statistics say the opposite, that because Africa hardly pays back anything. </p>

		<p>This is how encroachment works.  </p>
<p>First comes mass immigration, and then they move the African border north.</p>
<p>This is not unlike how Albanians created &#8216;Kosovo&rsquo;, how China is resettling Han Chinese to overwhelm Tibetans, or how Mexicans are implementing their &#8216;reconquista&rsquo; of the Southern United States.</p>
<p>The doctrine of &#8216;conquest by incremental encroachment&rsquo; relies on the victim not realizing their moral right to resist, and not having the stomach to go to war to reclaim lost territory.</p>

		<p>I can only assume this refers to the African holdings of Spain.  I was unaware that France still had any.</p>
<p>Ironically if current immigration trends continue then France will be part of Africa regardless of its location, if you know what I mean.</p>

		<p>I would say no need to worry: this claim that France is somehow part of Africa is so ridiculous that no one could possibly believe it. Unfortunately, whites have proven themselves capable of pretending to believe things that are so utterly absurd that we have cause for real alarm here!</p>

		<p>Spain has at least two territories in Morocco.  They have built some impressive fences separating them from Morocco which get stormed from time to time.</p>
<p>France has several islands around Madagascar.</p>

		<p>While wikipedia can be reliable, many times it is extremely biased.</p>
<p>I was reading the wikipedia page on Islamic slavery the other day. The editors engaged in significant whitewashing in order to downplay this horrific historical ordeal. The site can be found here: <a href="http://goo.gl/JFQzA" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/JFQzA</a></p>
<p>Here is an example of the wikipedia editors attempting to downplay Islamic slavery: &#8220;Islam, by sanctioning slavery - however mild a form it generally took - also extended legitimacy to the nefarious traffic in slaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adding &#8220;however mild a form it generally took&#8221; was not intended to be a mere syntax redundancy. Calling Islamic slavery &#8220;mild&#8221; is odious whitewashing. Then going on to say that the so-called mild slavery happened &#8220;generally&#8221; is further whitewashing.</p>
<p>Despite the entire page downplaying Islamic slavery, what it doesn&rsquo;t tell you is about how horrific slaves suffered in Islamic captivity. Jared Taylor, however, is not afraid to tell you the truth. He has written a book review about the shocking ordeal 1.25 million Europeans faced while being slaves to the Muslims: <a href="http://goo.gl/e2gQG" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/e2gQG</a></p>
<p>An AmRen article about bias at wikipedia can be read here: http://goo.gl/nFy63</p>

		<p>Anyone that saw the 2006 World Cup may even agree that France is a partly African European state. The game was France vs Italy and it looked like Nigeria vs Italy. If France doesn&rsquo;t stop this out of control African immigration, they will be the first to be sacrificed at the multiculturalism alter.</p>
<p>You have two choices Europe (and the United States), you can either:<br>
1) Keep your First World standard of living (low unemployment, low crime, high median income, high literacy rate, etc) and reject African/Muslim/Hispanic immigrants.<br>
-or-<br>
2) Embrace multiculturalism, and these 3rd world immigrants, and watch all forms of advanced civilization in your country disappear faster than you can say &#8220;Welcome to Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure the Chinese would love Europe and America to so nobly choose the latter.</p>

		<p>Well, if you think about it, they are partly African, considering the masses of Africans living there. African-European? I think not. <br>
Are people surprised that when you fill a nation with non-Europeans it becomes less European? I am not. If things continue on their current path this nations would easily fit in an African Union.  <br>
I try not to think about it often, but knowing that our great cities like Paris are filled with Africans often makes me ill. What makes me often giggle is that these &ldquo;African-Europeans&rdquo; think they are European! <br>

		<p>Well, if you want to get technical about it both countries control territory on the African continent. Spain controls the cities of Melilla and Ceuta while France controls several minor islands near Madagascar. This is most likely just a case of an overly meticulous editor.</p>

		<p>I think the article is referring to French and Spanish holdings in Morrocco and off the coast of east Africa but it was poorly worded.  I would say that technically these places are European territory but someone could point out that the baneliues around Paris are Middle Eastern territory.</p>

		<p>Spain and France have residual colonial toeholds in Africa, just like France owns the islands of St Pierre and Miquelon ten kilometers off the coast of Canada.</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s tiny islands within Canada&rsquo;s 200 mile territorial limit don&rsquo;t make France a part of North America. </p>
<p>The wording here describes France and Spain as &#8220;partly African European States&#8221;, so, it doesn&rsquo;t appear to be referring to colonial possessions. It is referring to France and Spain proper.</p>

<p>Sounds like sound overenthusiastic &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; One Worlder at Wiki, in his his/her zeal to erase national borders, is getting ahead of themselves. Someone should inform him/her that so far the European Union is still working on the Eurabia project:  inducting first Turkey then the entire Maghreb into the EU, thereby flooding the Continent with tens of millions of unskilled, culturally-incompatible Muslim grunt-workers, welfare-consumers, and Islamic agitators. </p>
<p>Only AFTER the Eurabia project has been successfully completed can the Eurafrica project begin. </p>
<p>So please, Wiki editors, get your timeline straight before you post. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t rely on anything put out by Wikipedia. Wikipedia is run by blatantly leftist administrators. I and numerous others have tried on many occasions to edit pages to correct &#8216;facts&rsquo; that were simply wrong, only to have edits deleted, the facts going down the deep dark memory hole where all things inconvenient to leftist ideology go. You go to the discussion pages or the edits page to find that they were deleted for not having a source. Okay, not a problem. Put in the source. Now they will erase it claiming that they disagree with the source, or the source is not a reliable one, or even that the source is racist. In the event that they cannot make up a convenient nonsense reason to disagree, such as when I used for a source a quote from a liberal professor at a top university that disputed one of their convenient fictions, they simply erased it anyway. These guys are into moral relativism, leftist utopian fantasy and race-based preferences whole hog. You read their discussion pages, you find nuts talking about calling Beethoven a &#8216;world citizen&rsquo; instead of a German because he would have preferred to been labeled that way. </p>
<p>At best, only use Wikipedia for gaining access to some convenient links at the bottom of the page, for further reading to make up your own mind on topics.</p>

		<p>I found it interesting that Morocco wasn&rsquo;t included in the AU but then I learned that the country submitted an application for admission into the European Union some years ago! Luckily it was rejected by some leaders with a little common sense but who knows about the future. If they admit Turkey there would be no legitimate reason to deny them.  </p>
