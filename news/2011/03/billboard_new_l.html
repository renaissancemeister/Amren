<h1>Billboard, New Law, Highlight Racial Turn for Abortion Debate</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Zachary Roth, Yahoo! News, March 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As if America&rsquo;s debate over abortion weren&rsquo;t contentious enough, it&rsquo;s lately been stirred by the addition of another hot-button issue: race.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Arizona became the first state in the nation to outlaw abortions performed on the basis of the race or gender of the fetus. And an anti-abortion billboard that uses an image of President Obama to target Chicago&rsquo;s black community has sparked a furor.</p>
<p>The Arizona bill, signed into law on Tuesday by Governor Jan Brewer, a Republican, makes it a felony for doctors or other medical professionals to perform an abortion in order to help parents choose their offspring on the basis of race or gender. The law does not punish the woman having the abortion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor Brewer believes society has a responsibility to protect its most vulnerable  &mdash;  the unborn  &mdash;  and this legislation is consistent with her strong pro-life track record,&#8221; a spokesman for Brewer told Reuters.</p>
<p>But opponents of the unusual measure contend there&rsquo;s little evidence that fetuses in Arizona are being aborted on the basis of gender or race. And they say the law could lead doctors to ask women about their reasons for having an abortion  &mdash;  something supporters of abortion rights view as a private decision.</p>

		<p>If it&rsquo;s legal to murder a baby inside a woman on the woman&rsquo;s whim, why should it be illegal to do this because of race or anything else? Isn&rsquo;t that like saying &#8220;it&rsquo;s illegal to get an abortion if you wear a blue shirt on Tuesdays.&#8221;</p>
<p>The worldwide left is not only anti-white, but also anti-reason.</p>

		<p>This is interesting because if the diversitoids were to ever support abortion it would be to abort fetuses determined to be white and male. This wont be called &#8216;racial&rsquo; however, it will be given the name &#8216;tolerance&rsquo; or positive-action or something. It&rsquo;s the compassionate thing to do. </p>

		<p>As Savage says, what&rsquo;s good for the goose is good for the gander.</p>
<p>For years the left has been using ridiculous racial statements in their push for inane legislation.  Because abortion is the holy grail of the American left, only an appeal to &#8220;racial justice&#8221; will allow the bill to pass&hellip;and even then critics are everywhere.</p>
<p>Abortion is wrong, plain and simple.  Any call by race realists for forced or widespread abortions of blacks and other minorities will alienate mainstream conservatives more likely to be sympathetic to our cause.  Tread lightly, Amreners.</p>

		<p>American nonsense on &#8216;equality&rsquo; apparently has no bounds.<br>
So it is lawful, right and proper to terminate a preganancy on the grounds of poverty for instance (I assume the foetus is deemed to have &#8216;rights&rsquo; in this law), but a termination which is done explicitly for reasons of &#8216;race&rsquo; or &#8216;gender&rsquo; is unlawful.<br>
   - Therefore children who merely have the misfortune to be born into povert are deemed unworthy with no rights or government protection and deserving of death because of that fact.Those having the protected characteristics are guaranteed the full force and protection of the law.<br>
  What does that tell you about modern America?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to have a child of a certain race, don&rsquo;t have sex with people of that race.  </p>

		<p>This is crazy. If people don&rsquo;t want to have a baby because the father is black, they shouldn&rsquo;t be forced to. I thought Arizona understood issues like this. Next they will make it a crime to choose not to have sex with black people.</p>
<p>The gender thing makes sense, because there needs to be a 50/50 gender balance. But that obviously doesn&rsquo;t apply to race.</p>

<p>There is no 50/50 balance when it comes to abortion for gender. The man has no say whether or not the child gets aborted even though he contributes %50 of the chromosomes. It is inconsistent to Feminist who arrogantly, due so a moral superiority complex,  claim to argue on basis equality of outcome, but advocate privilege of merit when it suits them.</p>

		<p>Abortion is murder, plain and simple, and I&rsquo;m against it.  The issue isn&rsquo;t choice, the issue is life.</p>
<p>If we, say, give blacks the okay to abort (because we know what a strain on the economy they tend to be), then it follows that we shouldn&rsquo;t arrest any of them for turning their children into &#8220;ghetto lobster.&#8221;  And taking it even further, black-on-black crime shouldn&rsquo;t be prosecuted.  For me, it&rsquo;s about consistency.</p>
<p>This is why we need for them to be in Africa (along with any whites or anyone of any other race who have children with them).  They can do what they want over there, and we can have a civilized society over here.  Not to mention that their culture has no place in a civilized society.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sick of this stuff from liberals and nonwhites.  It&rsquo;s more the white liberals and neocons that annoy me, because they are the ones pushing this and letting them get away with it.  If you don&rsquo;t want to get pregnant period  &mdash;  regardless of your race  &mdash;  here&rsquo;s are some suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Don&rsquo;t have sex.</p>
<p>2.  Have protected sex.</p>
<p>3. Wait until you&rsquo;re married and can financially afford kids.</p>
<p>4. Give the baby up for adoption.</p>
<p>5. If you don&rsquo;t want to deal with the &#8216;stigma&rsquo; of having a mixed race baby, then don&rsquo;t have unprotected sex with someone of a different race.</p>
<p>6. If you are hurt by whites&rsquo; looks when you are dating a black or hispanic man, then don&rsquo;t date a black or hispanic man.  Problem solved.</p>

		<p>This is a silly, waste of time law.  As it stands, abortion is legal- a person doesn&rsquo;t have to state WHY they are having the abortion in order to get it. They do not have to argue their case in front of any authority, at this time, anyway. Also, it is not legal past a point where where one can determine the sex (although there may be exceptions, but I believe that goes state by sate- not sure).</p>
<p>This brings up a conundrum of the right.  If conservatives don&rsquo;t want welfare and entitlements paid to people for having babies they can&rsquo;t support, then what is the plan for all these babies?</p>
<p>Of course, the obvious answer is that people should not be making babies they can&rsquo;t support and don&rsquo;t want- but it&rsquo;s quite obvious that what SHOULD be, isn&rsquo;t going to be.  It is obvious that the not-too-bright or able will not control their breeding habits.  So what to do?  The care and feeding of the exponentially expanding underclass will forever, and increasingly, get dumped on the middle class.  What&rsquo;s the plan, here?</p>
<p>I really think the anti-abortion conservative faction would have a much more powerful voice if they addressed this obvious dilemma.  I, for one, would love to know the stance on that.</p>

		<p>If my daughter was raped, and her &#8220;doctor&#8221; wanted to know why she wanted an abortion, I can think of plenty of places where that doctor would disappear.</p>
<p>Weighted down really well, off the continental shelf would be my first choice, just as deep as the rapist.</p>

Not quite.<br>
Blondie is asked out by a black man. If she declines, he asks &#8220;Whazz da matta  &mdash;  you raciss or sumptin&rsquo;?&#8221; <br>
No. She&rsquo;s a 17 year old who has never been taught how to answer that question. <br>
Three hours later she&rsquo;s a victim of &#8220;date rape&#8221;.<br>
Three weeks later a home pregnancy test shows up positive.<br>
It happens more often than you&rsquo;d think.<br>
Sure, she shouldn&rsquo;t have been dating a black.  Nice pat answer.</p>
