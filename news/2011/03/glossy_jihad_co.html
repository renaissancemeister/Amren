			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 13, 2001</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Al-Qaeda has launched a women&rsquo;s magazine that mixes beauty and fashion tips with advice on suicide bombings.</p>
<p>Dubbed &#8216;Jihad Cosmo&rsquo;, the glossy magazine&rsquo;s front cover features the barrel of a sub-machine gun next to a picture a woman in a veil.</p>
<p>There are exclusive interviews with martyrs&rsquo; wives, who praise their husbands&rsquo; decisions to die in suicide attacks.</p>
<p>The slick, 31-page Al-Shamikha magazine  &mdash;  meaning The Majestic Woman  &mdash;  has advice for singletons on &#8216;marrying a mujahideen&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Readers are told it is their duty to raise children to be mujahideen ready for jihad.</p>
<p>And the &#8216;beauty column&rsquo; instructs women to stay indoors with their faces covered to keep a &#8216;clear complexion&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They should &#8216;not go out except when necessary&rsquo; and wear a niqab for &#8216;rewards by complying with the command of Allah Almighty&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A woman called Umm Muhanad hails her husband for his bravery after his suicide bombing in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And another article urges readers to give their lives for the Islamist cause.</p>
<p>It advises: &#8216;From martyrdom, the believer will gain security, safety and happiness.&rsquo; </p>
<p>More traditional content for a women&rsquo;s magazine includes features on the merits of honey facemasks, etiquette, first aid and why readers should avoid &#8216;towelling too forcibly&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A trailer for the next issue promises tips on skin care  &mdash;  and how to wage electronic jihad.</p>
<p>The first issue&rsquo;s editorial explains that the magazine&rsquo;s goal is to educate women and involve them in the war against the enemies of Islam.</p>
<p>It says: Because women constitute half of the population  &mdash;  and one might even say that they are the population since they give birth to the next generation  &mdash;  the enemies of Islam are bent on preventing the Muslim woman from knowing the truth about her religion and her role, since they know all too well what would happen if women entered the field of jihad.</p>
<p>&#8216;The nation of Islam needs women who know the truth about their religion and about the battle and its dimensions and know what is expected of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The publication is being distributed online by the same Al-Qaeda media wing behind Inspire, a similarly slick magazine that encourages young Muslims in the West to commit terrorist atrocities.</p>
<p>JJames Brandon at anti-extremism think tank Quilliam, said: &#8216;Al-Qaeda see how effective magazines are at pushing the ideals of western culture and want to try the same thing.</p>
<p>&#8216;As a result they have come up with a jihadist&rsquo;s version of Cosmopolitan magazine.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The Islamic status quo is perceived as modern by young whites because multiculturalism is accepted and they have no choice but to move or live in varying degrees of fear.</p>
<p>Some English old-timers would argue over any suggestion that the royal family could be involved.</p>
<p>Surely if Ms. Tudor did not approve of multiculturalism, Parliament would not accept it.</p>
<p>And iif Parliament  did not accept multiculturalism, then whites would not be so naieve to follow the whims of Parliament.</p>

		<p>Where is the magazine telling white women to support white western peoples?</p>
<p>This is what depresses me to no end.  Muslims, blacks, Indians, Hispanics, Orientals all have group cohesion.  They support each other against outsiders.  We do not.  They defend themselves.  Death threats against that UCLA girl are merely deplorable, &ldquo;just like her comments&rdquo;.  Why aren&rsquo;t the police looking for the perpetrators of terrorist threats (in NJ you can go to jail for that)?  Even commenter&rsquo;s here criticize this silly girl over nothing quite frankly.   The public outrage of some kid saying &ldquo;all blacks leave the store&rdquo; (Wal-Mart) but the press ignores the Knoxville horror.  Two young men having criminal records for life for littering with cotton balls but 137 white women are raped every day by blacks.  Not to mention the Johns Hopkins student who was murdered last year while his mother listened to the murder over his cell phone. The genocide of Afrikaners goes unreported and unlamented.  Our troops are sentenced to life imprisonment for doing their jobs in Afghanistan.  Why are we even there?  I could go on and on over how whites do not report on the horrors inflicted on other whites, do not support those white victims yet will beat their chests over some slight, real or perceived, directed against a majority.  Yes, I said majority.  <b>WE ARE THE MINORITY</b> you nit wits, <b>not them</b>.  We have a right to life and liberty.  We have a right to our homelands.  We built the modern world.  Not the Japanese or the blacks or the Latinos, we did!</p>
<p>What will it take for us to defend ourselves?  I really think we are doomed.  We have what is worse than no group cohesion, we have self-hatred.  Once we are minorities in every corner of the world it is off to the gallows with us.  But then, maybe the whites will go to the rope willingly.  Except for a few of us the Chinese put in a zoo for the novelty of blond and red hair and green and blue eyes.</p>

<p><i>And the &lsquo;beauty column&rsquo; instructs women to stay indoors with their faces covered to keep a &lsquo;clear complexion&rsquo;.</i></p>
<p><br>
A clear complexion that will be seen by nobody. </p>
<p>This mag&rsquo;s health-and-beauty advisor forgot to mention to readers that staying completely covered up and never letting sunlight touch your skin is also helpful in developing a Vitamin D deficiency and other related health problems   &mdash;   like Rickets. </p>
<p>Allah might prefer that women spend their entire lives shrouded in a 7th Century version of a HazMat suit, but Mother Nature has a dissenting opinion on the matter. </p>
