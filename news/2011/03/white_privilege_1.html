	<p>March 30-31 at Augustana College, Rock Island</p>
<p>White Privilege Summit 2011 is a community event to discuss race, privilege, inequality and the fight for social justice. We need your voice at this important summit. Free and open to the public.</p>
<p>What is white privilege?</p>
<p>Do whites benefit from racial inequality? The idea of white privilege suggests that being white in a racialized society such as ours is actually a position of advantage. If people of color face barriers and discrimination in their daily lives, what is the effect for whites? Are whites unaffected by race, or are they privileged by race? Peggy McIntosh, an anti-racist activist and scholar, describes white privilege:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets that I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was &#8216;meant&rsquo; to remain oblivious. White privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>About the summit</p>
<p>The White Privilege Summit provides an opportunity for critical discussions about diversity, multicultural education and leadership, social justice, race, gender, class, sexual orientation, environment, health, religion and systems of privilege/oppression.</p>
<p>The summit serves as an opportunity to examine and explore difficult issues related to white privilege, white supremacy and oppression. This summit is not about making white people feel guilty. The summit is about critically examining the society in which we live and working to dismantle systems of power, prejudice and inequality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Featured speaker Morris Dees: &#8216;Whose America?&rsquo;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>In 1994, Morris Dees warned the U.S. attorney general that radical militias were planning domestic terrorist strikes. Six months later, the Oklahoma City Bombing was tied to one such group.</p>
<p>As founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Dees uses the law in his battle against prejudice and hatred. In the 1980s and 90s, he worked against the KKK and neo-Nazi groups with a series of historic lawsuits. Today, Dees focuses his attention on anti-government militias. In his expose, Gathering Storm: America&rsquo;s Militia Threat, Dees explains the dangers these groups represent. He is also author of A Lawyer&rsquo;s Journey, an autobiography, and Hate on Trial: The Case Against America&rsquo;s Most Dangerous Neo-Nazi. Dees also was the The subject of the television movie Line of Fire and portrayed in the feature film Ghosts of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>His appearance is sponsored by the Office of Student Activities in conjunction with the White Privilege Summit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Tracy Davis: Masculinities (Re)considered: Complicating Privilege to Better Promote Learning and Social Justice with College Men<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Contemporary discourses regarding men and masculinities are stagnated by an overly simplistic view of privilege and oppression, as well as &#8220;essentialized&#8221; notions of identity. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Marsha Smith and Dr. Araceli Masterson-Algar: &#8220;Privilege in a Global Perspective&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Although prevalent, privilege is not a purely American concept, nor is it a purely white privilege concept within a global perspective. This program is designed to take a different look on privilege as it relates to the world, specifically China and Spain.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Nadia Brown: &#8220;The Impact of Identity on Legislative Decision Making&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Brown&rsquo;s {snip} talk will explore the complexities of representing race, gender, and class in policy deliberations by investigating how black female officeholders legislate &#8216;intersectional issues&rsquo; that are pertinent to members of marginally disadvantaged subgroups.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Lisa Killinger and Dr. Cyrus Zargar: &#8220;Muslim Identity and White Privilege&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>This panel will offer a personal glimpse into Muslim-American life in the context of white privilege. A 2006 study suggests that 39 percent of Americans express feeling intolerant toward Muslims; {snip}.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Valerie S. Garr: &#8220;White Privilege: Lessons Learned From Both Sides of the Ocean&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>This interactive session will use a variety of visual mediums to demonstrate how white privilege has presence in both domestic and global arenas. {snip}</p>
<p>Augie Debate<br>
Ben Fischer, Andrew Heidtke, Jamila Washington<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The participants will begin with a discussion of three distinct issues of white privilege related to the immigration system: biometric identification used at entry and exit points at the border; the question of critical race theory with regards to the crafting of immigration law; and the public&rsquo;s response to immigration reforms in terms of media coverage, public dialogue and the question of nativism. {snip}</p>
<p>We are members of the Augustana Debate Union. {snip} This year&rsquo;s topic is Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one or more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Featured Session for College Staff (All are Welcome to Attend)</p>
<p>Alfred Ramirez and Greg Aguilar: &#8220;Creating a Welcoming &amp; Inclusive Campus Community: What Does It Take?&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>This interactive workshop will provides tools and strategies to develop cultural awareness, cross-generational interaction, inclusive environments and diverse leadership.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Kate Parks: &#8220;White Privilege and Hurricane Katrina&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Are so-called natural disasters color-blind? This session will examine how white privilege impacted evacuation and recovery during and after Hurricane Katrina. {snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Elfline: &#8220;The Sound of Blackness: Motown, Southern Soul and the Question of Authenticity&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Can one record be &#8220;blacker&#8221; than another? If so, what sounds create this difference? Does a &#8220;blacker&#8221; sound mean a better sound? In the years following the &#8220;British Invasion&#8221; of 1964, many American record labels were banking on specific answers to these questions in the search for a more authentic popular music. This presentation seeks to identify how race was heard in the mid-60s and how this perception affects the reception of a record label&rsquo;s entire catalog.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Khara Coleman Washington and Tionn Fambro: &#8220;Justice, Equality and White Privilege&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>This program addresses the effect of white privilege on the opportunities of people of color in the legal profession. It also examines whether or not white privilege has a perceptible or demonstrable effect on the administration of justice.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Marme: &#8220;Leveling the Playing Field and Historical Lock-ins&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>At the introductory level of economics, one can easily explain the loss to efficiency created by discrimination and therefore argue that discrimination is economically irrational and that a level playing field is best. {snip}<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Pat Shea, Dr. Michael Schroeder, Dr. Sohyun An: &#8220;Poverty, Race, and Privilege&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>The audience will participate in activities that would immerse them into the &#8220;hidden class rules&#8221; which influence the lives of citizens living in poverty as well as the middle class. Then, they will make the connection between race and poverty, via a full audience activity, which illustrates how people of different races and ethnicities are perceived by others, and the profound influences that these different perceptions have on their lives. The session will end with an exploration of these dual questions: What then IS white privilege? And how can those with &#8220;privilege&#8221; use it to work for social justice?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Featured Session  &mdash;  Stone Lecture Series</p>
<p>Dr. Jose Ruben Parra-Cardona: &#8220;Learning from Their Voices: Developing Community Based Programs of Research with Underserved Latino Populations&#8221;</p>
<p>Latinos in the US, and particularly Latino immigrants, are often times depicted as one of the main sources of problems for the US society and economy. This presentation will briefly review the historical roots of Latino migration into the US, as well as research findings from studies highlighting the life experiences of US and foreign born Latinos in the US. {snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Salisbury: &#8220;Diverse Backgrounds, Diverse Experiences: The Case of Study Abroad&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Study abroad is widely touted as a fundamentally transformative experience for college students. Despite broad efforts to promote and diversify access to study abroad, participation patterns have remained disproportionately white and female. {snip}</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Kivisto, Dr. Molly Todd: &#8220;Social Justice for Immigrants&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>This session examines some of the most pressing issues facing immigrants in the U.S. {snip}</p>
<p>Eric Rowell and Dr. Darrin Good: &#8220;Careers and the Privileged&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>This program will focus on professional careers that tend to be dominated by whites, particularly white males, as well as on academia as it relates to jobs and tenure positions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Anti-Racism Task Force of the Southeastern Iowa Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America &#8220;White Privilege, the Church, and the Onus of Systems and Institutions&#8221;<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Racism is more than just individual prejudice. It is prejudice plus the power of systems and institutions to act on that prejudice. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Reflection Session 5:15 pm<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>Reflective sessions are an opportunity to think about and discuss experiences throughout the summit. Participants will be divided into groups and conversations will be led by student and faculty facilitators.</p>

		<p>I am a beneficiary of white privilege.  I have been privileged that my parents saw that I was raised properly, educated, and prepared to work and make a successful life.  They had the same privilege.  So did their parents, and theirs, and theirs.  So will my children and grandchildren.  Inter-generational success.  White privilege.</p>

		<p>I need to make a slight apology to AR regulars.  Several weeks ago, I called for the elimination of virtually all tax exemption statuses for foundations, trusts, 501s, religious institutions, and what not.  </p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not backing off that stance.  Indeed, this article actually endorses it, with the ELCA being heavily involved in this hate fest.  </p>
<p>The reason I&rsquo;m apologizing is that I forgot to include colleges and universities in the list of institutions whose tax exempt status should be revoked.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Morris Dees doesn&rsquo;t believe a word of what he preaches. He is, however, making a very nice living doing this, so expect him to continue until the gravy train runs out. </p>
<p>Does he even live in a diverse neighborhood? </p>

		<p>Privilege is granted by men, Talent is granted by a higher power. Privilege is affirmative action, hate crimes laws, and the special legal protections provided by the United States Department of Justice to Eric Holder&rsquo;s &lsquo;people&rsquo;. Privilege is the expectation to not be offended.</p>
<p>Black Privilege is not responsible for their success on the basketball court any more than White Privilege is responsible for the group wealth we have historically created through innate intelligence, creativity, and hard work. Group differences in Talents account for group differences in outcomes.</p>
<p>A paper titled The Natural Aristocracy of Man from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams is linked to below. Jefferson argues that in the age of gunpowder, human outcomes naturally derive from Talent, and Virtue. &lsquo;All Men Are Created Equal&rsquo; was not a protest against Natural Law, but instead against Artificial Law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greatbooks.org/index.php?id=301" rel="nofollow">https://www.greatbooks.org/index.php?id=301</a></p>
<p>In Jefferson&rsquo;s day, Artificial &#8216;Privilege&rsquo; was embodied by European Royalty. Today it is something completely different.<br>

<p>I have come to see that so-called &#8216;white privilege&rsquo; is something I and other whites earn through self-respect, respect for others, and respect for the community I live. Anyone who respects themselves enough to take advantage of a largely free education system, respects others by not victimizing them, and respects their community by maintaining high community standards is as <b>RIGHTLY PRIVILEGED</b> as are those around them who do the same.</p>
<p>Do blacks respect themselves, their neighbors, their communities? Hardly. Ghettos don&rsquo;t just appear out of thin air. They are built, maintained, and perpetuated by the people who inhabit them.</p>
<p>If anyone attends this summit, please ask the following questions. Do blacks in majority black nations and neighborhoods experience black privilege? Shouldn&rsquo;t majority black nations and neighborhoods produce the same privileges for blacks? <br>

		<p> By all means, if you&rsquo;re in the area, and you&rsquo;re White, drop in. And be prepared to argue with these self-hating Whites until the cows come home, about their so-called &#8220;White Privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p> In fact, if you have like-minded White friends who find this as ridiculous as I&rsquo;m sure all of us regular AmRen posters do, take them along. Disrupt the conference if at all possible. Find fault with every smug assumption that these race traitors (and the blacks and other non-Whites they&rsquo;re trying to impress) hold so dear.</p>
<p> In short, do the same thing to them that so many Leftist groups have done to conservative or race realism speakers on college campuses the last few years. Let these people see how it feels to fall victim to the &#8220;thug&rsquo;s veto.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let me explain this:<br>
So even if whites don&rsquo;t have a real privilege, but none-whites do bad let&rsquo;s say in school, whites are accused of having a privilege?<br>
Or in other words:<br>
If one kid learns much more for school or is talented and the other is not, than the first kid has to suffer because of the stupidity of the second kid? This is pure and simple Socialism. Everyone has to be the same, and if the theory doesn&rsquo;t fit with the reality than the better ones must be held down by law.</p>

I can tell the readers from personal experience that Canada is EVEN further down this multi-culti nightmare than our American neighbours. Pushing this PC rot down the throats of every impressionable youngster. At my uni it is the white liberal people who rejoice in multiculturalism and panel discussions into how to better accomodate &#8220;minorities&#8221;, whilst &#8220;minorities&#8221; self-segregate and enjoy the benefits of &#8220;their&#8221; skin colour. The twisted irony of course is every building at my Uni is named after a &#8220;dead white male&#8221; and yet we are discriminated in this present day-and-age. The true enemies of white people are misguided white liberal&rsquo;s!</p>

		<p>What worries me is how this impression of privilege as being granted to members of a group who have been stereotyped as having never earned it nor are deserving of it. Therefore they must either give it all up  &mdash;  these invisible privileges that they are so deserving of  &mdash;  or have it taken from them a la the Afrikaaners in South Africa.</p>
<p>I think most of the people who preach this stuff are talking about their own personal privileges, as well as their friends. They need to take a look at the demographic breakdown of poverty in the U.S. and discover that 40% of individuals living below the poverty line do not fit into the groundbreaking epiphanies of Morris Dees.</p>

		<p>If being white is such a privilege, why does virtually every white   &mdash;  on the irrefutable evidence of where they choose to live when they can afford it   &mdash;   wish that there were far fewer non-whites around? If there were no non-whites around, there would be nobody to extract that mystical white privilege from. </p>
<p>Is it that we&rsquo;re all too dumb to realize how blacks and Mexicans are really doing us a favor? Can&rsquo;t we all just understand that increased crime and violence and decreased wealth and social cohesion are a small price to pay for the feeling of superiority that comes from looking down at all the pitiful people of color?</p>

		<p>I live one hour from Rock Island, IL and I&rsquo;m considering attending this summit to counter, if opportunity permits, any racist comments toward whites and/or any promotion of diversity in America.  At the very least to video tape the event for any signs of animus towards whites (LOL). If anyone is interested in attending, I can provide logistical support including local airport, hotel, meal and transportation details for the area. </p>

		<p>Does he [Morris Dees] even live in a diverse neighborhood?    &mdash;  -D.B. Cooper wrote at 6:49 PM on March 23<p>Ah, ha ha ha ha! Friend, need you even ask?<p>Dees lives in the Old Cloverdale neighborhood of Montgomery, AL.  Here&rsquo;s a Google satellite view of his palatial home and tony neighborhood: https://tinyurl.com/4h6sskl. <p>The Old Cloverdale neighborhood association bills its neighborhood as &#8220;one of Montgomery&rsquo;s choice residential areas since the turn of the century. It is one of Montgomery&rsquo;s earliest suburbs and is the oldest landscape garden designed residential area in Alabama&hellip;&#8221; <p>Look at the Old Cloverdale picture gallery here: https://tinyurl.com/4q8ufjm - count all the &#8220;minorities&#8221; (or, let&rsquo;s say, signs of any) you can discern, and then get an impression how well Mr. Dees practices what he preaches for his less wealthy fellow whites. &#8220;White privilege,&#8221; indeed!</p></p></p></p></p>

		<p>I associated with Blacks for many years in schools, work, gyms, and dojos Sometimes they expressed attitudes that were foolish, ignorant, or self destructive. Never did I hear anything close the level of dementia and degeneracy of the whites in the above article.</p>
<p>When Blacks have a privilege, they brag about it. They fight  anyone whom they feel is trying to deprive them of the privilege. They don&rsquo;t apologize for having it. In other words they act like normal humanity. </p>
<p>When Blacks are successful, they brag about, and fight to retain their position. They don&rsquo;t agonize over any injustice of their success.</p>
<p>If nothing else, Morris Dees and associates make me wonder whether whites use what mental capacity they have, more effectively than blacks. Certainly, the white participants the &#8220;summit&#8221; don&rsquo;t.<br>

&#8216;An invisible, weightless knapsack?&rsquo; Is this funny lady on drugs Daddy?</p>
<p>Does white privilege refer to these over-paid useless-university people? Or for some strange reason does it apply to workers such as myself that get up early in the morning to don the high-visibility gear for a minimum-wage? Well? They ARE trying to make us feel guilty!<br>

		<p>Even though they&rsquo;d like to see us dead, I geniunely feel sorry for these people. Theyre situation is tragic.</p>
<p>Its so sad that academics have spent careers filling books, journals,and lecture halls with always more convoluted excuses for minority underachievement instead of considering the simple alternative of genetics. Professors are just too addicted to marxism to give up now. <br>
 <br>
They don&rsquo;t even look for evidence anymore. Example: White privilege is like an &#8216;invisible knapsack&rsquo;. What does it mean when they use words like &#8216;invisible&rsquo;, &#8216;hidden&rsquo;, or &#8216;institutional&rsquo;?: The circumstances that hold blacks and other disadvantaged groups back aren&rsquo;t detectable by your eyes. You wont find specific instances of racism if you look around when you leave the house. At least not enough to explain their disadvantaged status. Instead you have to go to their theories to really see whats going on. Want proof. All the other professors in the field believe the same things. That should be enough. Take it on faith.</p>
<p>If you are ever confused by any of this leftwing academic stuff just remember this: <br>
In the end, it is all designed to do one thing: prove that differences between black and whites, rich and poor, men and women, cats and dogs, etc. exist because of our culture, the way we have been taught to think, not because of our nature. (In fact we don&rsquo;t have a permanent, God given nature. Or to put it in their terms, &#8221;essentialised&rsquo; notions of identity&rsquo;.) When our identities are abolished, we can create the rainbow utopia.</p>

I&rsquo;ve already done it. It&rsquo;s the most fun a person can have (excluding sex of course). You don&rsquo;t needs to be &#8216;thugish&rsquo;, just ask them embarasing questions like when they say race is a social construct ask them why there are genetic markers that indicate a person&rsquo;s race. Why nonwhites are risking their lives to sneak into white countries but whites aren&rsquo;t risking their lives to sneak into nonwhite countries. Ask them why in 2005, according to The Department of Justice, 37,460 white women were raped by black men and 0 black women were raped by white men. Etc.<br>

<p>It seems like Mr. Dees and his fellow shakedown and fearmonger artists have done extremely well for themselves. I know enough about the demographics of the U.S.A to be able to say with some certainty that his neighbourhood is probably not in the black areas of Montgomery!</p>

		<p>I am an alumnus of this school.  Two decades ago they were pushing this anti-white garbage but never so over the top like this conference.  I can gladly report that the vast majority of students I knew did not get brainwashed with the multicult doctrines.  They knew first hand how much their families struggled to put their kids through college.  They also were offended that the school gave out scholarships to students simply for being a minority.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s my privilege to pay outlandish property taxes to support a school system shot through with Mexicans, Somalis, and God only knows who else has flocked to this city for the generous handouts and benefits.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my privilege to pay a nine percent sales tax so the water park,free daycare and free lunches for kids up to 17 years old can go on all summer at the community center.  Funny these things were supposed to keep the out-of-control Mexican and Somali broods off the streets so the police wouldn&rsquo;t be chasing them through my yard all summer long.  Oops failed again liberals.  Looking forward for the sirens and helicopters at 2am to start up again once school lets out and the weather improves.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my privilege to stand in line at the grocery store behind the Mexican family in designer clothes, driving a Yukon on 24s, paying for their groceries with WIC.  I&rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut until it&rsquo;s my turn to pay cash and load my groceries into my 20-year-old Ford.  The burden of privilege I suppose.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s my privilege to work a job I don&rsquo;t much care for just to keep my health insurance.  I&rsquo;m a prideful man and when my beautiful white son was born in November there&rsquo;s no way I was going to look the hospital billing staff in the eye and say &#8220;DSHS.&#8221;  You know that&rsquo;s what the white girl across the hall with the premature three-pound black baby said.  I&rsquo;m sure the father didn&rsquo;t because I never saw him.</p>
<p>What we should do for the bleeding-heart champions of the &#8220;historically disadvantaged,&#8221; who produce nothing and live at the pleasure of our tax remittances, is show up at their conference and tell them how much of a burden this &#8220;white privilege&#8221; really is.  Frankly I don&rsquo;t much want it anymore, they can have it and I&rsquo;ll sit back and reap the fruits of their labor for a change.</p>

		<p>The concept of &#8220;white privilege&#8221; is a basic building block that the modern &#8220;anti-racist&#8221; movement uses to build their entire legislative and cultural agenda. We can mock it (and we should!) but we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate how important the concept is.</p>
<p>We need to take the concept head on and tear it down. I really wish more of our best thinkers were on the case here.</p>
<p>Personally, I have gone through Peggy McIntosh&rsquo;s backpack &#8220;checklist&#8221; and the truth is that many of the privileges she lists there no longer hold (she came up with the list in 70s or 80s - a long time ago) and many of them are in grey area where if you look at the statistics it is not at all clear that white males, for example, are perched on the top of the heap as the anti-racist stereotype maintains. And we also have to be honest acknowledge that a few privileges still hold, if they do. Nothing to be gained by not being honest. </p>
<p>But overall the concept is pernicious and it remains unquestioned. I think it&rsquo;s ripe for a take down.</p>

		<p>This &#8220;knapsack of privilege&#8221; business is what the Greeks called &#8220;gnosticism&#8221;, secret knowledge accessible only to the special few.  It has an appeal to many people and has for millennia.  Like kids who follow the newest, hippest bands, and drop them when their records go platinum.  Like Pokemon cards or Hello Kitty gear, very cool for young teens, until the 12 year olds caught the fad.  This is just a bunch of sick old freaks luring wannabe philosophers into a cult of self-abasement.  Say the incantations and be wise like us, cast aspersions on fools who doubt.  It&rsquo;s very attractive to a large set of bright losers.  They should have stuck to memorizing all 156 different Pokemon characters, it&rsquo;s silly but harmless.</p>

		<p>What non-whites call &#8220;White priviledge&#8221;, whites simply call HARD WORK. While these other races were sitting around doing absolutely nothing for centuries, or in the case of India and China, millenia, whites were HARD AT WORK discovering and developing the new world. The white genius has spent 5 centuries building modern civilization while the other races sat around doing zip. In the late 90s the triumph of capitalism and and the booming America economy proved once and for all that the white man&rsquo;s way is better. To protect themselves, foreign governments had to blame whitey for their problems rather than admit they made a mistake and followed communism for 20 years. Now it&rsquo;s 20 years later and those brainwashed kids are now young adults. And they really DO think their problems are caused by whites. Every good thing that the world enjoys today has come from the white race and white America in particular. Just wait and watch what the world becomes once they get rid of us all and sideline us. We will see the world devolve into a mess of squabling nationalities very quickly and probably another world war. Just wait and see&hellip;</p>

		<p>Peggy McIntosh, marxist, man-hating, egalitarian, femi-nazi, anti-White, describes White privilege:</p>
<p><i>I have come to see white privilege as an invisible package of unearned assets!</i> </p>
<p>Oh, hell, are Peggy and her &#8220;backpack&#8221; still around?  I thought (and hoped) she was locked up somewhere in an asylum, her ideas burned in an incinerator at 451 degrees . I haven&rsquo;t heard her name in years, but I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see her and her ugly ideas resurrected to rise up out of the slime.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had to sit through many excruciatingly torturous teachers&rsquo; PD developments featuring Peggy and her Backpack.  I swear I&rsquo;ll go postal if I have to sit through one more&hellip;. Peggy represents all that is wrong with the educational system as she strives to tear down Western Civilization and the White Males that created it via old, discredited 60s psycho-babble, touchy-feely theories.</p>
<p>Peggy decries <i>a culture that assigns a deficit identity to many people except young, preferably blond, white males&hellip;This culture, she said, &#8216;has made a few, especially our young, white males, dangerous to themselves and the rest of us, especially in a nuclear age.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Geez, Peggy, Gimme a Break!</p>
<p><i>It&rsquo;s not their fault,</i> Peggy McIntosh once observed of white males. <i>They didn&rsquo;t ask to be born white males.</i></p>
<p>Peggy and her Backpack have done more to destroy the American educational system than any other singular person I can think of, including Bill Ayers and Paulo Freire:</p>
<p><i>Drawing upon feminist and multiculturalist theories, SEED programs aim to sensitize teachers to the perceived perils of &#8216;male privilege&rsquo; and &#8216;white privilege.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Are you GAGGING yet?   If not, stay tuned, there&rsquo;s plenty more!</p>
<p>To continue:</p>
<p><i>She strives to encourage teachers to put more emphasis on cooperation among pupils, and less on competition between them&hellip;to advocate fundamental changes in what students learn; history, for example, should be &#8216;the history of inclusion&rsquo; - a history that heralds the doings of ordinary people (often women and minorities) doing ordinary, unheralded things.</i></p>
<p>You may be laughing (or screaming) by now but this culture-destroyer is deadly serious and is taken as the utmost authority in how children are educated by the over lords at the highest reaches of the Department of Education.  Her influence is everywhere; textbooks re-written to conform to HER world view, teaching methods twisted to support her notions of a &#8216;male-free&rsquo;, no-competition classroom.</p>
<p><i>she warns that competition in the classrooms can be hurtful, cautions against giving out gold stars, and envisions schools that go &#8216;beyond win/lose.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Exactly what the Old Soviet Bosses preached   &mdash;   and that didn&rsquo;t turn out so well for them, did it?</p>
<p>American education has become totally politicized, feminized, dumbed down and &#8220;therepized&#8221; by the likes of Peggy and her Backpack, and not for the better.</p>
<p>But then I&rsquo;ve always maintained that the American educational system is not about educating children:  It serves a dual purpose, that of a non-White job corps and to produce socialized, mind-numbed drones of the state.</p>

		<p>This is another example of the irrationality of the left. The left takes some aspect of human reality (private property, class, hierarchy, male leadership) and apply a stigma to it and proceed to try to abolish it. When the effort fails and the body count has mounted to the point even they cannot ignore it, they repeat the whole process again with some other aspect of normal life. Talking about &#8220;white privilege&#8221; in a white society makes as much sense as talking about &#8220;black privilege&#8221; in a black society. It is simply a normal aspect of life. </p>
