<h1><a href="http://www.thelocal.se/32624/20110316/">Swedish Court: Naked Muhammad Pics Legal</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Local (Stockholm), March 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Swedish court has ruled that depicting the prophet Muhammad naked together with his nine-year-old wife naked is legal, freeing a local politician on charges of racial agitation.</p>
<p>Malmö district court has ruled that the poster does not fall foul of press freedom legislation and confirmed a not guilty ruling from March 3rd in favour of Carl P Herslow, leader of the Skåne Party (Skånepartiet) who faced charges of agitation against an ethnic group (hets mot folkgrupp).</p>
<p>The poster included the text: &#8216;He is 53 and she is nine. Is this the kind of wedding we want to see in Skåne?&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Herslow admitted producing the poster but contested the charges and argued to the court that the poster was intended to stimulate a debate about Islam, which he argued was incompatible with democracy and equality.</p>
<p>The case had been brought by the Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern - JK) - the country&rsquo;s top legal official and responsible for prosecution of cases involving freedom of speech. </p>
<p>Prosecutor Bo Birgerson, representing JK, said that the distribution of the poster showed disrespect to Muslims.</p>
<p>The poster was seized at a public meeting held by Herslow and the party in 2010.</p>
<p>The Skåne Party is a small right-wing populist, anti-immigration party based in southern Sweden. The party was founded by Carl P Herslow in 1979 and was originally formed to protest the Swedish state radio and television monopoly and to advocate self-government for the province of Skåne. </p>
<p>The party won 17 votes in the general election in 2010, claiming 0.8 percent of the vote in its home municipality of Malmö.</p>
<p>The Local&rsquo;s calls to the Skåne Party for comment on Wednesday have not been returned. <br>

		<p>At least here in the US, one is still free to say what one wants about Islam. That is, unless one works for the government, or for a university, or some other institution besotted with PCness.</p>

		<p>If a cartoonist or an artist makes a picture that is offensive to the Christian faith, Christians will openly complain, but will not do violence against that person.  Many Christians will even pray for that person &#8220;to see the light&#8221; and be converted to their faith.</p>
<p><br>
If a cartoonist or an artist makes a picture that is offensive to the Jewish faith, the Jews and the Anti-Defamation League will complain that person is anti-semitic.  But as long as that person is not a violent neo-nazi, it is doubtful that even the militant Jewish Defense League will go after that person.  In other words, most Jews would not be inclined to do violence against that person, no matter how much it would offend them.</p>
<p>However, whoever made that poster of a naked Mohammed with his nine year old wife, has his or her life in danger!  Islam prohibits any kind depiction of Mohammed as a &#8220;graven image blasphemy&#8221;.  If you do anything to offend Islam, you as an &#8220;infidel&#8221;, have yourself in danger of being killed by angry Muslims!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. Islam is probably the most dangerous thing happening in Europe. It has the potential to be really bad for the US if the PC of Islam spreads to the US. It already has begun. I keep hearing on the news Islamophobia. Which part funny/ironic/sad. Many Liberals are even against Islam for its core faith being anti homosexuality anti freedom anti women, etc. Others still rely on the age old &#8220;judge individuals and not the group&#8221; thing.</p>

		<p>Sahih Muslim 4206:</p>
<p><i>There came to him (the Holy Prophet) a woman from Ghamid and said: Allah&rsquo;s Messenger, I have committed adultery, so purify me. He (the Holy Prophet) turned her away. On the following day she said: Allah&rsquo;s Messenger, Why do you turn me away? Perhaps, you turn me away as you turned away Ma&rsquo;iz. By Allah, I have become pregnant. He said: Well, if you insist upon it, then go away until you give birth to (the child). When she was delivered she came with the child (wrapped) in a rag and said: Here is the child whom I have given birth to. He said: Go away and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she came to him (the Holy Prophet) with the child who was holding a piece of bread in his hand. She said: Allah&rsquo;s Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the child to one of the Muslims and then pronounced punishment. And she was put in a ditch up to her chest and he commanded people and they stoned her. Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her. Allah&rsquo;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) heard his (Khalid&rsquo;s) curse that he had hurled upon her. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made such a repentance that even if a wrongful tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgiven. Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.</i></p>
<p>Khalid, be gentle?  As if.</p>
<p>Looks like Muhammad&rsquo;s approach to an adulterous woman is slightly different than the one Jesus took.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading the Koran right now.  It&rsquo;s disgusting.  It actually claims that Abraham and Moses were Muslims, not Jews.  It claims that the Jewish and Christian scriptures were originally in concordance with the Koran, and that those scriptures were &#8220;corrupted&#8221;.  Muslims continue to believe this in spite of archaeological evidence that proves it isn&rsquo;t so.  Oh, and Jesus is going to come back and kill everyone who believes he was crucified.  But according to the Muslims we &#8220;share&#8221; Jesus and Mary with them, because some 7th century illiterate stole from Jewish and Christian scriptures to try and legitimize a pagan religion.</p>
<p>The multiculturalists want us to pretend that Islam and Christianity have a lot in common, when they in fact do not.  They claim that &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221; results from ignorance of the beauties of Islam.  I think that all Westerners should read the Koran and Muhammad&rsquo;s life story for themselves.  Then they&rsquo;ll really be Islamophobic.</p>
<p>One is not really free in the US to be completely blunt in public about the ridiculous theft of Jewish and Christian scriptures that is the Islamic religion.</p>
