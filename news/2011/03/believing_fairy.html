<p>As I wrote in my previous post, the Justice Department plans on looking at bullying cases in local school districts that violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act. DOJ says it will, &#8220;enforce federal laws that protect students from discrimination and harassment at school because of their race, national origin, disability, religion, and sex, including harassment based on nonconformity with gender stereotypes.&#8221; Those who believe the DOJ is doing nothing wrong, because this law would also include white heterosexual males, are ignoring recent reports from former Justice Department employees who say the Civil Rights Division is not enforcing legislation in a race neutral manner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Steven Hayward at National Review cites two liberal &#8220;stalwarts&#8221; at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1985 who believed &#8220;civil rights laws&#8221; were not meant to &#8220;give civil rights protections to all Americans.&#8221;  In his article he writes:</p>
<blockquote>The view that civil-rights laws should not be color blind was perhaps most explicitly asserted way back in 1985, when Mary Frances Berry and Blandina Ramirez, two longtime leftist stalwarts on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, issued an official statement in their roles as commissioners that said, &#8220;Civil rights laws were not passed to give civil rights protections to all Americans, as a majority of this Commission seems to believe. Instead, they were passed out of a recognition that some Americans already had protection because they belonged to a favored group; and others, including blacks, Hispanics, and women of all races, did not because they belonged to disfavored groups.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>In a piece published today Hans Bader, Senior Attorney at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, correctly points out that Washington is currently &#8220;inventing&#8221; an anti-bullying law today.</p>
<p>However, the administration is on a quest to make it a federal issue, and one must wonder if the Department of Justice will enforce the 1964 Civil Rights Act as race blind as they claim to enforce the Voting Rights Act.</p>
<p>Testimony from two former DOJ attorneys who blew the whistle on the Department about the handling and eventual dismissal of the New Black Panther Party voter intimidation case begs the question not so much if DOJ ever did prosecute what is specifically called a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; against a white heterosexual male, but if the Justice Department truly looks at civil rights legislation for all people in an equal manner.</p>
<p>According to 2009 hate crime statistics over at the Justice Department, the prosecutions of hate crimes against minorities and homosexuals indeed overwhelms the majority of cases, but the question remains as to how many cases against whites and heterosexuals were reported but were deemed as non-hate crimes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The Washington Post&rsquo;s Jennifer Rubin wrote in Commentary Magazine in September of 2010:</p>
<blockquote>Coates&rsquo; bombshell testimony before the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights focused on the Philadelphia black-panther case.  Members of the New Black Panther Party, one of whom was an Obama campaign poll watcher and local democratic official, used a nightstick and racial epithets to intimidate voters in a Philadelphia precinct. But the Obama Administration killed a successful lawsuit against these criminals, dismissing it after career Justice Department lawyers had already obtained victory in the case, as a former Justice Department Lawyer the Philadelphia Bulletin, and a newspaper editorial note.  (The New Black Panther Party, which attacks what it refers to as &#8220;blooduscking Jews,&#8221; is recognized as a racist, antisemitic hate group even by liberal civil-rights groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center.  Its voter intimidation was captured on videotape by a college student).
<p>&#8220;Career lawyers pursued the case for months, including obtaining an affidavit from a prominent 1960s civil rights activist who witnessed the confrontation and described it as &#8216;the most blatant form of voter intimidation&rsquo; that he had seen, even during the voting rights crisis in Mississippi a half-century ago.&#8221; But Obama&rsquo;s political appointees at the Justice Department overruled them, dropping the case after victory was already assured because &#8220;the court had already entered a default judgment against the&#8221; Black Panthers. Thanks to that outrageous decision, the only result of the case was a meaningless injunction telling one of the three defendants not to commit such crimes again (and telling him not to commit such crimes only until 2012, and not barring him from committing such crimes in his home city, but rather barring such crimes only in Philadelphia).</blockquote></p>
<p>If the federal government will be prosecuting bullying cases under civil rights laws going forward, how can all American people be so confident that the cases will be considered fairly, given the history of both the Justice Department in recent years and the point of view about the intention of civil rights laws from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Commission? Believing everyone should get a fair shot under the law is nice to think, but it is not the reality.</p>

		<p>When they decide whites have legitimate rights too they&rsquo;ll just have to call them &#8216;super-duper civil rights laws&rsquo; or &#8216;overdo-laws&rsquo;. I hope they become the most important laws in the land. Then we can say these important rights don&rsquo;t apply to others. A 40 year precidents already been set on these kinds of things. </p>

		<p>Where was there ever a written law stating any color would come first? It&rsquo;s outrageous that we should have to live with hate crimes laws and hate speech. The deck is rigged in everyone else&rsquo;s favor. Wake up America the Philistines are upon us. </p>

<i>&#8220;&hellip;the question remains as to how many cases against whites and heterosexuals were reported but were deemed as non-hate crimes.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Everyone who reads AR knows of at least one black on white attack in their own community that would have been deemed a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo; had it been white on black. Instead, the police dismiss the non-hate crime as merely a case of &#8216;being in the wrong place at the wrong time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just what does it mean to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? Simple, anytime a white man is in the proximity of a black man.</p>

		<p>Bullying seems to be the Obamas&rsquo; new cause celebre.  I wonder how much of the bullying problem is really black or Hispanic on white?  To listen to that crowd, the only kind of bullying that ever takes place is non white on non white or, when a homosexual is the victim.</p>

		<p> &ldquo;Civil rights laws were not passed to give civil rights protections to all Americans, as a majority of this Commission seems to believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Years ago, some radio talk show actually called Immanuel Celler, the Congressman who sat down and wrote the Civil Rights law in 1964. They asked Immanuel who the law was supposed to cover. Immanuel answered without hesitation - -  the law was intended to COVER EVERYONE! Pure, plain and simple.</p>

		<p>I live in a rural area of the deep South and work in a profession that brings me in contact with many local middle/high school students. There is conclusive evidence that our young white males are dropping out of our predominantly black public schools at alarming rates. I hear the same story from these students and their parents: &#8220;I can&rsquo;t get my kid to go back to school. He&rsquo;s tired of being bullied by the black kids.&#8221; The parents do not have the  financial means to send their sons to safer private schools. Our local public schools are run by blacks for blacks and no one seems to care about these young white boys. They are &#8220;home schooled&#8221; for a while, but then drop out of the education system altogether at age 16.  Where is DOJ? Answer: Chasing phantom whites who bully blacks. </p>

		<p>The entire concept of &#8220;hate crime&#8221; is an unnecessary complication of the legal system. If a black family moves into a white neighborhood and someone burns a cross on the front yard of the black family&rsquo;s house it does not matter if the person burning the cross hates blacks or not. He is guilt of vandalism and a violation of private property rights. <br>
 <br>
Also, hate crime legislation can segue into censorship of speech and writing.  </p>

		<p>White Americans made a huge mistake in giving in to Kennedy and Johnson&rsquo;s so-called &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; movement.<br>
  It was sold as somehow &#8216;enshrining racial equality&rsquo;, but as perceptive people at the time said, it&rsquo;s not about that at all, it is purely and simply legally privileging designated &#8216;protected&rsquo; groups so they have more rights than groups that are not protected.<br>
 In this way it can more properly described as a feudal system (incidentally something that George Washington and the founding fathers loathed and reviled), rather than anything free and democratic.Not even the Soviet Union suffered an abomination such as this system that Americans passively accept.</p>

		<p>Bullying has of course been around since we lived in caves, but now the left is trying to characterize it as something done only to homosexuals.  The whole anti-religion, anti-Western, anti-white agenda of the leftists is scripted to bring down Judeo-Christian morality and replace it with what was called &#8220;free love&#8221; in the sixties.  They&rsquo;re so desperate to put down the opposition that they&rsquo;re willing to support fundamentalist Moslems to do it.  I guess they intend to deal with the problem of sharia when it&rsquo;s upon them.</p>

		<p>it has been clear for some time that the best tactic for enforcing the civil rights of whites in the US is simply to demand that the laws designed to project racial or sexual minorities apply to everyone.</p>
<p>this does not entail dismissing or trivializing crimes against racial or sexual minorities.</p>
<p>it simply means demanding that all double double standards be abolished. </p>
<p>the strategy is so simple, so reasonable, so morally irrepproachable, but it cannot fail if it is applied consistently.</p>
<p>the crucial move here is to REFRAME white grievances (against quota hires, black bullying, black crime, etc.) in terms of the civil rights of white people as one minority among others.</p>
<p>framing the issue in terms of universality and equality stands a good chance of abolishing race preferences, which would be a gigantic win for white people.</p>
