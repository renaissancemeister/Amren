<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One year after passing the toughest immigration law in the country, some Republicans are getting tired of the fight. A group of GOP lawmakers in the Senate say the state should focus less on immigration and more on jobs and economic issues like the state budget. That same group now stands in the way of Senate President Russell Pearce and his latest effort to crack down on those illegally living in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s time for a timeout in Arizona on immigration bills,&#8221; Sen. John McComish said last week. &#8220;I think the emphasis on immigration bills in general is distracting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like many Republicans at the Capitol last year, McComish was a supporter of Pearce&rsquo;s tough immigration bill, now simply known as SB1070. But the leader of the Senate may not have the same support as last year, as McComish and other GOP lawmakers are showing signs of fatigue. {snip}</p>
<p>All of this has some GOP lawmakers thinking it&rsquo;s time to hold off on the issue and start working on other areas that need attention, such as the state budget and job creation.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There are several other Republicans in the Senate who share the concerns of both McComish and Reagan, which could make it tough for Pearce to get his immigration agenda through the Legislature year.</p>
<p>Sen. Frank Antenori said last week he&rsquo;s not going to vote for the measure until there&rsquo;s budget deal in place. {snip}</p>
<p>Also last week, Sens. Rich Crandall and Sylvia Allen both voted against Pearce&rsquo;s latest proposal (SB1611) in committee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, there are several other lawmakers who are not saying whether they support the bill, such as Sens. John Nelson, Don Shooter and Steve Yarbrough.</p>
<p>Taken together, Pearce doesn&rsquo;t have the support right now to pass the bill. But Pearce says he&rsquo;ll have the votes once it goes to a vote in the Senate. {snip}<br>

<p>I thought it was the GOP&rsquo;s philosophy that government has two functions: 1) to enforce the laws and 2) to get out of the way of business, which does the <i>real</i>  &#8220;job creation.&#8221; Immigration control falls under the law enforcement category. Since when did the GOP decide that government could &#8220;create jobs?&#8221;</p>

Texas demographer: &#8216;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos&rsquo;<br>
Houston Chronicle Blog<br>
February 24, 2011<br>

<p>HIGHLIGHTS: </p>
<p>Looking at population projections for Texas, demographer Steve Murdock concludes: &#8220;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two of every three Texas children are now non-Anglo and the trend line will become even more pronounced in the future, said Murdock, former U.S. Census Bureau director and now director of the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Texas population can be divided into two groups, he said. One is an old and aging Anglo and the other is young and minority. Between 2000 and 2040, the state&rsquo;s public school enrollment will see a 15 percent decline in Anglo children while Hispanic children will make up a 213 percent increase, he said.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s future looks bleak assuming the current trend line does not change because education and income levels for Hispanics lag considerably behind Anglos, he said.</p>
<p>Unless the trend line changes, 30 percent of the state&rsquo;s labor force will not have even a high school diploma by 2040, he said. And the average household income will be about $6,500 lower than it was in 2000. That figure is not inflation adjusted so it will be worse than what it sounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a terrible situation that you are in. I am worried,&#8221; Murdock said</p>

		<p>Quite frankly, a failure to address this issue will make &#8220;jobs and economic issues&#8221; right now a moot point in 20 or so years as the descendants of the immigrants vote themselves hefty shares of our wealth. Unless mass immigration is cut off, fighting over such things amounts to little more than sound and fury in the long run. And since pretty much all of our economic problems have an immigration dimension, it&rsquo;s hardly irrelevant in the present, either.</p>

<p>How can such bills be &#8220;distracting&#8221; when we still have 20 million plus illegal invader squatting in this country? Get in the fight or get out of the game!</p>

		<p>Pretty much sums up why we have come so far in becoming a Socialist nation led by an unqualified black man, and are now debating allowing Sharia law into our judicial system.<br>
The Soviets knew this about us.  The Islamists know this about us.  The Progressives know this about us.  And the blacks have known this about us.  We Whites are no longer the citizen soldiers who braved harsh winters at Valley Forge and looked down on the sunshine soldier in our desire to be free.  We today ARE the sunshine soldiers.  We don&rsquo;t have the convictions or the manliness to stand tall for the long haul.  So our enemies know if they chip away, chip away, chip away we will tire of the battle.  We are too fat and happy and content to sit and worship our football heroes on television than to care about our soldiers in the field fighting our enemies.  We care more for an extra 5% in our paychecks than we do about the fact union dues are used to enslave us to Progressive masters.  We run and hide when blacks accuse us of being racist when we notice the double standard applied to us.  We are a nation of hedonists, a nation of television numbed idiots, a nation of cowards who are content to let our teens fight our wars while we numb ourselves watching The Biggest Loser or Win it in a Minute.  We scoff at God and our Christian Messiah while shrugging our shoulders as mosques are built in every community.  While blacks murder us, we leave it to black juries to render &#8220;justice&#8221;.  If we don&rsquo;t soon become the men we were at Lexington and Concord, at Normandy and Iwo Jima&hellip;..we will most certainly lose our once great nation to the colored races and be their slaves while they rule over us as they do in every colored run nation on earth - with corruption, violence, and incompetence while exterminating the annoying Whites in their midst.<br>

		<p>Behind the scenes, there is a massive push by capitialists to reverse the recent trend in the GOP towards towards enforcing immigration laws.  We aren&rsquo;t going to win the immigration war until the capitalist system is reformed so that profits cannot come before nation.  </p>

		<p>Whether we&rsquo;re talking about the 25-30 MILLION illegal immigrant parasites or those &#8220;legal&#8221; H1b visa-holding immigrants&hellip; We ARE TIRED of this farce! Depending on which set of official &#8220;lies&#8221; you accept for our unemployment total   &mdash;   we have far too many MILLIONS of unemployed of our own. Unemployed American workers who neither need nor want more competition for what few jobs are offered!</p>
<p>SHUT THE IMMIGRATION DOOR and keep it shut   &mdash;   for thirty years until stabilization is reached again. Until ALL willing American workers have decent paying jobs with a future. We are NOT, repeat NOT obligated to support the third worlders. Offering them free admission, preferential treatment with respect to jobs and educational grants and admissions. Often also perpetual support, courtesy of our taxpayers for the immigrants and their broods.</p>

		<p>If they don&rsquo;t fight illegal immigration eventually there won&rsquo;t be a Republican Party beyond the local level worth speaking of in Arizona. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t believe me? Just look at California.</p>
<p>But hey, it&rsquo;s their choice.</p>
