<h1>Exclusive: Wyclef Reps Blame &#8220;Enemies of Progressive Change&#8221; for Shooting</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Grandmaster Grouchy Greg Watkins, AllHipHop News, March 20, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Organizers of Wyclef&rsquo;s most recent trip to Haiti have spoken out about a recent incident in the country, where the rapper was shot. </p>
<p>Wyclef Jean was shot in the hand in Haiti yesterday evening (March 20th), during a tour of the country to support Presidential candidate Michel Martelly.</p>
<p>Martelly is running against law professor and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, after massive fraud was uncovered in the first round of voting in November. </p>
<p>Jimmy Rosemond helped organize Wyclef&rsquo;s trip to Haiti, and a concert last week encouraging peaceful elections. </p>
<p>Tens-of-thousands of people attended the concert, which featured The Fugees (and Lauryn Hill) Busta Rhymes, Michel Martelly and a host of local artists. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear that enemies of progressive change in Haiti are behind the shooting of Wyclef -those that don&rsquo;t want to accept that a monumental change is inevitable for the betterment of the Haitian people,&#8221; Jimmy Rosemond told AllHipHop.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;This incident will not deter those of us that see the election as crucial to the country&rsquo;s future,&#8221; Jimmy Rosemond continued. &#8220;Today, hundreds of thousands of Haitians are heading to the polls to determine the leader of Haiti.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to sources in Haiti, the elections have already started late, as some polling stations are still waiting for materials and ballots.</p>
<p>So far, the country is calm, as both sides have continuously urged restraint. </p>

<p>Really? Massive fraud? I&rsquo;m surprised.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;This incident will not deter those of us that see the election as crucial to the country&rsquo;s future,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Black rule is black rule. The outcome is irrelevant. Haiti will remain Haiti regardless of the results.</p>

		<p>Another typical black delusion..if you just believe it<br>
then its true. &#8220;Monumental Change&#8221;?..is that like &#8220;Change<br>
You Can Believe In&#8221;&hellip;? more meaningless words.<br>
Just keep rapping and dancing&hellip;until you drop dead from<br>

<p>Are we talking about Haiti or Illinois here&hellip;OH HELL!!! I forgot, the two are one and the same. This also caught my eye &#8220;&ldquo;Today, hundreds of thousands of Haitians are heading to the polls to determine the leader of Haiti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think the above statement would be more correct if it said &#8220;hundreds of thousands of Haitian blacks today are heading for welfare lines in the U.S.</p>

		<p>#2 sbuffalonative is right.  It makes absolutely no difference who wins.  Haiti will continue to be a basket case no matter what.<br>

		<p>The Haitians are still exactly where they were right after the earthquake that hit them OVER a year ago.  Nobody has done thing one to pick up the pieces - LITERALLY.  We sent tons of money and food and clothing and shoes - to no avail.  The Haitians refuse to get off their duffs and help themselves; apparently they think manual labor, like the Brits and Germans engaged in after WWII when their countries were destroyed - is beneath them.  When I was a kid, if I made a mess, I was told I had to pick it up.  I really don&rsquo;t see that this is any different.  Yeah, Mother Nature made a mess.  So PICK IT UP, clean up, build anew and better   &mdash;   and go on with this business of living.  Haitians&rsquo;ll never get it though.  Too much work.</p>

		<p>This is what happens when in 1802 a voodoo cannibal African slave to the French uses her black pig magic to create a revolution that ends up with 100% genocide of the every single white on that part of Santa Domingo island formerly owed by the Spanish.</p>
<p>Whites forget also forget after killing all the whites who were probably cannibalized as juju calls for they spoke French but refuse to call it that opting to call it &#8220;creole&#8221; meaning all as one or something to that effect. </p>
<p>Be glad America didnt have a majority of slaves. </p>
