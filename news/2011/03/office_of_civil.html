<h1>Office of Civil Rights to Examine Discipline of Black Students</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Mary Giunca, Winston-Salem Journal, March 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. Office of Civil Rights will visit six Winston-Salem/Forsyth County schools next month in its review of whether discipline policies, especially for black male students, are in line, school officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The visits to conduct interviews, part of a review that began a year ago, will take place the week of April 4, said Allison Tomberlin, general counsel for the school system.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The school system has come under criticism from the NAACP and a local leadership forum over statistics indicating possible disproportionate punishment of black students. African-American students are suspended more than any other racial group in the district. Black males accounted for 63.8 percent of suspensions in 2009-2010, according to school data, but represent only about 13 percent of all students.</p>
<p>The Office of Civil Rights, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education, plans to visit Mount Tabor and Reynolds high schools, Hanes, Jefferson and Mineral Springs middle schools and Mineral Springs elementary.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In addition, schools are being asked to describe how they handle discipline, at what point discipline matters are turned over to an assistant principal and who enters discipline information into the computer system.</p>
<p>Jim Bradshaw, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education, said {snip} the office is looking at whether the school system discriminates against black students, and in particular black males, by disciplining them more frequently and more harshly than white students in similar circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Specifically, the review focuses on the disproportionality in suspension rates,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The review will also look at whether black students are referred disproportionately to law-enforcement authorities, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Tomberlin said the school system learned of the investigation in May. She said she was told investigations are prompted by survey data, newspaper reports and a pattern of complaints. Between June and February the school system provided the civil-rights office with discipline policies, procedures and statistics.</p>
<p>Theo Helm, a spokesman for the school system, said the civil-rights office has asked for data from 2008-2009 and 2009-2010. During that time, the district has reduced the number of suspensions, reduced the maximum length of out-of-school suspension from 10 to eight days, eliminated suspensions for being tardy or skipping school and added cultural sensitivity training. {snip}</p>
<p>The Rev. Seth Lartey, a member of a local leadership forum that is concerned about school suspensions, said he has not been invited to meet with the federal representatives. He said the school system alone cannot be held responsible for discipline problems. Parents sometimes don&rsquo;t support their children in school, and students don&rsquo;t always come to school ready to learn, he said.</p>

		<p>It is pretty obvious that black males misbehave at a far larger rate than anyone else. It is also a proven fact that blacks will get away with behavior that would get anyone else suspended immediatly or expelled (if kids are even expelled anymore) I know that segregated schools will not come about any time soon (unless blacks demand it) so it is best to get your kid out of public school or even a private school that is more than about 5-7% minority. One of two things will happen- either blacks will get free reign at schools and it will be more chaotic than ever or Whites will be punished for minor infractions to even out the &#8220;disparity&#8221;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine any white who is so foolish as to believe black misconduct is not rampant throughout the entire nation.</p>
<p>They surely deserve to live in the midst of blacks, forced to put up with their crimes and misconduct.</p>

		<p>Yes, they should investigate the discipline of black students.  Discipline, the noun.  Not discipline, the verb.</p>

		<p>Hundreds of thousands of young people cannot be educated and violently interfere with the education of others. These need to be permanently expelled so that teachers can teach and students can learn.<br>
 <br>
What will happen to those young people once they get kicked out of school? The same thing that happens to them anyway. They will end up in prison. The sooner they get there, and the longer they stay, the better it will be for decent people. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Stupid is as stupid does&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Violent is as violent does&#8221;</p>
<p>Bantu youth is just much more violent, prone to use violence more, much quicker to use violence, more physically able to use violence, and much more extreme in the use of that violence when it is used.</p>
<p>A stare, a glance, a perceived stare or glance, a parking spot, an argument over a dime or a cig, all can provoke a violent response of an overpowering nature. And when directed against a whitey, done with malevolence and hate. Even more extreme then as well. That violence against whitey too done with relish and enjoyment.</p>

<p>Many schools now have cameras in the hallways, cafeteria and on the buses.</p>
<p>Put &#8216;em in the classrooms too. Let the NAACP or any other bogus organization that wants to review the tapes.  Maybe then they&rsquo;ll get an idea about how the little monsters act in schools.</p>
<p>But then again, they&rsquo;ll claim the deviant behavior of black children is &#8220;normal.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Discipline in our schools is an absolute joke!  I have taught - the one thing the stats do not show is the number of times a disciplinary referral goes missing or is thrown away by administration.  </p>
<p>The stats also fail to look at the fact that some teachers simply do not write referrals because in most cases it is an absolute waste of time.  </p>
<p>The numbers would be way worse, but the teachers are told through innuendo to play the game.  They are scorned for too many referrals.  Referrals are often time coupled or even tripled or quadrupled together - meaning one punishment for 4 offenses.   </p>
<p>There were a few students at a school I taught at that had over 20 referrals in one school year.  My question is - how does this happen?  I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s 20 small things - at some point that student&rsquo;s school should be over.</p>
<p>We wonder (well not us, but as a nation) why Asian dominated countries are destroying us in the classroom and will eventually own our country - we systematically excuse bad behavior calling it &#8220;self-expression&#8221; or &#8220;a response to an environment.&#8221;  </p>
<p>We lack discipline - that is the heart of the problem.</p>

<p>Does any one of us actually believe that black males might have been suspended for being tardy too many times or skipping school?  Not suspending them would be punishment to a great majority of them because they know they are never going to further their education based on their educational record and intellectual abilities.</p>

		<p>Are they going to post the skew data for violent offenses and multiple offenses and offenses by those who have criminal records?</p>
<p>Oh, and just to show &#8216;it&rsquo;s not all black and white&rsquo;, let&rsquo;s look at the number of offenses by blacks against blacks for which &#8216;protection of the student body&rsquo; _requires_ one or both students to be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>I would also like to see how many parents of various groups show up to contest junior&rsquo;s suspension or are available to help enforce punishment as more than TV and X-Box.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s not a civil rights matter if a student of color shows up unprepared to learn or has poor parental support in getting to school.  And the second that becomes obvious in the statistics, USOOCR should back off.</p>

		<p>&#8220;African-American students are suspended more than any other racial group in the district. Black males accounted for 63.8 percent of suspensions in 2009-2010, according to school data, but represent only about 13 percent of all students.&#8221;  There is a clue perhaps.  Isn&rsquo;t this the same statistic as the African Americans in jail to their percentage in the population?  But if the inquiry is carried out by unbiased people surely the real cause will be found and must be published to all Americans that African American students most likely earn their suspensions.</p>

		<p>It is obvious using the same logic that the district is discriminating against males versus females. Instead of &#8220;The Man&#8221; keeping people down, a strong case can be made that if unequal outcomes are conclusive proof of irrational discrimination it is &#8220;The Woman&#8221; who is keeping our male brothers down. Let&rsquo;s guess when the government will also investigate this blatant sexism in the school district. My guess is it will be right after the government investigates the conspicuous lack of Asian-Americans in the NBA&hellip;</p>

		<p>Young black men are the worst. The reason they are suspended is that they are often violent and stupid, attacking other students and causing hell for teachers trying to educate these children.<br>
Of course, the government won&rsquo;t mind a few rapes or stabbings here, a complete freefall of test scores, and an overall decline in civility as long as the blacks aren&rsquo;t offended.<br>

		<p>A recent study shows that black teachers in a school district near Atlanta punished the black students more frequently than the white teachers did. Are the black teachers engaging in racially-motivated discipline? Or do they simply have the freedom to call out bad behavior when they see it because they know that nobody will call them a racist for doing so?</p>

		<p>I doubt this investigation will go anywhere.  School districts have for about the last twenty years imposed &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policies when it comes to the things for which students get suspended or expelled.  The whole point to these &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policies is that the districts have very effectively covered their behinds by removing any discretion from the staff and imposing a sort of cookbook discipline.  </p>
<p>For this investigation to hit paydirt, the feds would have to identify individual school staffers that are deliberately deviating from their district&rsquo;s written policies, and I am terribly sorry: no staffer who wants to keep his or her job during a recession is going to do this.<br>
