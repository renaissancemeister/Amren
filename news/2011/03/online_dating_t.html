<h1>Online Dating: The Races Differ</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jessica Yadegaran, Philadelphia Inquirer, March 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With a plethora of interracial dating sites on the Web and a black president in office, one might think that we&rsquo;re living in a post-racial era. But, apparently, that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>According to a new University of California-Berkeley study of 1 million online daters, cyberspace is just as segregated as the real world. When it comes to dating online, whites prefer whites, research reveals. More than 80 percent of whites  &mdash;  even the 48 percent of males and 28 percent of females who said they were indifferent to race  &mdash;  sent messages to whites, and just 3 percent contacted blacks.</p>
<p>{snip} Young black men are the most likely to cross racial lines when looking for love online, and blacks, including women, were 10 times as likely to contact a white person as whites were to contact blacks.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t date outside of their race simply because they don&rsquo;t come into contact with people of other races in their communities, where churches, grocery stores, and housing are still quite segregated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mendelsohn says there are three possible reasons for the discrepancy between attitudes about interracial coupling and the actual behavior of online daters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be appearance management,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They think it makes them look better to say that they&rsquo;re open to another race. Also, saying you&rsquo;re open to another race is only stage one of the dating process. Stage two is actually taking the step. Another possibility that can&rsquo;t be discounted is that people are just hypocritical.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A major objective of the study was to gauge how changing attitudes about interracial marriage and an increase in dating opportunities have played out in relationships between blacks and whites. In the last 40 years, the approval rating of black-white intermarriage has gone from 3-1 opposed to 3-1 in favor, Mendelsohn says. But the study found that attitudes and behavior don&rsquo;t match.<br>

		<p>I am somewhat skeptical of this. After all, this is data taken from one website in early 2009. Two years ago.</p>
<p>Secondly, where I live, my eyes and experiences tell me that interracial dating is pretty commonplace.</p>

		<p>Attitudes and behaviors dont always match because though<br>
the person would date a person of another race, he<br>
or she may choose someone of the same race because  <br>
familarity may ease the stress which comes naturally from meeting someone new. So a person of the same race<br>
is chosen. But whoever claims that whites are not <br>
interested in non-whites is overlooking the fact that in<br>
the United Kingdom, 50 percent of black males are in<br>
relationship with white females and 33 percent of black<br>
females are in relationship with white males.<br>
And some famous people who are in a interracial relationship<br>
include Matthew Mcconaughey, Christ North from law and <br>
order . both are dating black females. Others include,<br>
Miss Ireland Emma Waldron dating a Nigerian, Doutzen Kroes<br>
the Dutch supermodel who planned to marry her black boyfriend,<br>
Sunnery James and Jon Jones the recent winner of<br>
the UFC 205lb  championship .</p>

<p>Were people really lying or was the approval rate data fabricated in the first place?  Liberals think if they artificially twist reality through the MSM to match their own ideology that it will somehow force people to accept it and change their own attitudes.    </p>

		<p>If relationships start as a response to mutual values then race as a function of skin color shouldn&rsquo;t be a barrier.  But nature doesn&rsquo;t work that way hence genetic racial differences make interracial couplings problematic and difficult. Why should that change because universities and other liberal institutions declare a societal change?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Cyberspace is just as segregated as the real world?&#8221; What world does he live in? If the net is still a free speech/association zone, it ought be more segregated than elsewhere. The outside world is now subject to political controls on who one must include as employees, students, or patrons. The laws forcing this are the work of hostile whites and minorities, the very same folks most whites wish to avoid.</p>

		<p>I have an argument with friends (especially female ones) who claim that they would date anorther race.(But never do)<br>
I say &#8216;desirability is determined by somethings&rsquo; rarity and beauty, the white race is the rarest( 7% of the world) and clearly the most beautiful. Even where other races seem  beautiful it is nearly always because they are at least half white&rsquo;<br>
I say &#8216;Why would you drive a cheap car when you could drive a Ferrari, why would you wear a rock when you could wear a diamond?&rsquo;<br>
I usually receive blank stares at this stage.</p>
<p>There are some clear facts that I&rsquo;ve noticed in dating.</p>
<p>* White men do not date black women unless the black woman is famous.(which means it&rsquo;s incredibly rare)</p>
<p>* Famous black men date white women exclusively which basically means everyone prefers white women over black women if they can ACTUALLY get one. Back to the ferrari analogy.</p>
<p>* White women do not date Asian men.</p>
<p>* White women are increasingly (But still rare) dating Black men simply because most of them have never seen a bad image of a Black man in their entire lives. Black males are only ever shown as fit, strong, attractive, smart and caring.</p>
<p>* White men Date Asian women often (I believe this is for white men who&rsquo;ve found that feminism has caused white women to be too demanding and they believe Asians are more submissive)</p>
<p>So I find this article perfectly correct. People here who are saying that whites are dating blacks in huge numbers are probably just noticing it more because it stands out.</p>

		<p>What always stuns me about seeing white women with blacks is how the women are leading the men around, they drive in her car, she pays for outings, etc. I don&rsquo;t know why white women are consistently dating beneath their station, but it seems to be very trendy for them to do so.</p>

		<p>I think that quite a lot of girls would have sex with the aliens in the movie &#8220;District 9&#8221; just to prove they are not RACISSSSSSS. Politicians and AG &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder (I like the coined term &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder whomever coined it)would defend the alien in &#8220;Aliens&#8221; right to gestate in a human host and burst the host&rsquo;s rib cage on it&rsquo;s way out!!! especially if said alien is black.</p>

		<p>Some grocery stores are segregated?  Oh, well, leave it to the left to even name this as one of three places that couples meet.  And church is apparently mentioned because it&rsquo;s known as (drumbeat) &#8220;the most segregated place in America&#8221;.  Heaven knows few lefties would be seen there!<br>
A lot of young folks now appear to meet sexual partners in school, at work, or in bars.  I would think that anyone seeking a mate online would be looking for a particular type of person or, even more specifically, one&rsquo;s ideal.  What difference would it make if the seeker welcomes all comers, including all races, when he/she can pick and choose anyway?  </p>

		<p>In the eyes of most liberals, it would be wrong to pressure a homosexual to live as a heterosexual, as they believe that homosexuality is something that some people are born with. However, the same liberals place enormous focus on trying to stop white people from only being attracted to other whites. Most whites were probably born with their preference for white partners.</p>

<p>Most whites avoid blacks not because they see them as strangers, they avoid them because they have had first hand experience with blacks and it left a bitter taste in their mouth.</p>
<p>If blacks moved into a white neighborhood and &#8216;acted white&rsquo; and lived by white community standards, whites wouldn&rsquo;t have any reason to leave.

		<p>As a white woman, it&rsquo;s still shocking to experience the backlash that can occur if and when one declines an advance by a black male. &#8220;No thank you&#8221; should be enough, but it isn&rsquo;t. The response tends to be loud and abrasive, and even abusive as one is declaimed as a racist. </p>
<p>Well, yes. Race is the issue. I don&rsquo;t find black men attractive; not in their actions, not in their appearance.  But evidently in this society, that&rsquo;s becoming an unacceptable decision on my part. </p>
<p>When did the needle move from &#8220;May freely interact with whomever she chooses&#8221; to &#8220;Must socially interact with blacks&#8221;?  </p>
<p>Frankly, when I see girls with black males, it strikes me that the girl has self-esteem issues and feels inferior. She seems to be drawn to someone who won&rsquo;t reject her.  Thoughts on that?</p>

		<p>Definitely true, Jean. It seems to be either insecurity (African Queen situation), or a desire to defy her father (look at I&rsquo;m doing now). Those women who get involved with black notables are of course, making a purely economic decision. I doubt that many of these relationships end well. The few women I&rsquo;ve known personally who have entered relationships like this have ended up with, at best, a trashed credit rating.</p>

<p>Jean: Are you blonde?  My observation is that blondes get way more attention from non-whites than even the most gorgeous brunettes.</p>
<p>Certain kinds of women attract certain kinds of men.  Black men used to hit on me in a very perfunctory way, as though almost from force of habit.  Like a cat chasing a mouse even when it isn&rsquo;t really hungry. I used to wonder if white girls were seduced by blacks simply because the available white guys weren&rsquo;t putting enough effort into it.   Depressing thought, but that&rsquo;s what I observed.</p>

<p><br>
just a couple of things I wanted to add.</p>
<p><i>Famous black men do not date white women.</i>  Yes, there are one or two out of every 100 famous black men who date White women, but majority of any kind of black men still date within their race.  Can you give me three black athletes, who are married to white women on top of your head?  </p>
<p><i>* White men Date Asian women often </i> Yes, less attractive ones. </p>

<p>I know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about. Once I had a strange black man sneak up behind me on the bus and say &#8220;What&rsquo;s your name?&#8221; practically in my ear. I loudly replied &#8220;Leave me alone!&#8221; hoping to get the attention of potential witnesses. The man went away and began loudly denigrating me to a man who appeared to be his father. They got off a couple of stops later, and they stood outside the window in front of me, yelling at me and making vulgar hand gestures as the bus pulled away.</p>
<p>I was too scared to ride that bus again. However, there were a number of express buses which ran directly between downtown and the suburbs via the freeway, and one of them went to my destination. The fare was a bit more expensive, but the bus was faster and I always felt perfectly safe on board. It was also much quieter. Guess what race the other passengers were.   </p>

		<p>Interracial dating has been going full-bore since the mid 90&rsquo;s, I think alot of white women are waking up to the reality that dating black more times than not is a losing proposition. White women are learning that black men 1. will mount anything that cannot outrun them 2. Have 2X the STD rate of white men 3. expect white women to pay for everything and are always borrowing money. 4. last, but not least, ending up alone with a bi-racial baby and no baby daddy in sight.<br>
Black men seem to be unable to be faithful no matter how gorgeous their significant other is, bottom line black men are incorrigible players. I think the main reasons that that white women date black men are 1. being &#8221; rebellious&#8221; (get back at daddy) 2. popular media portrays blacks as cool, whites as nerdy wimps 3. black men don&rsquo;t take no for an answer, using the race/guilt card as needed ( seen it happen).  As for me I want nothing to do with a white woman who has a history of dating blacks. White men out there would be shocked sh*@less at the number of white women who have romped with black men in their late teens early 20&rsquo;s and then reinvent themselves in their late 20&rsquo;s and onward so they can marry white and secure. Hopefully white women will wake up and start showing some racial love and loyalty.<br>

		<p>Why no comments on hispanic interacial dating which is double the black/asian mixes? I am hispanic dark skinned-mestizo and have been approached many numerous times by white females-Ive had sex with and have had the blonde blue eyed chick to the red haired green eyed Irish gal-to the rocker tattooed grung girl. Granted I look semi-white, but I did grow up with racial consciousness in Los Angelos-till moving out to a suburb in the Northwest. I had never before considered a white girl anything but plain before being surrounded by them. I stuck out like a sore thumb with my dark skin dark features and baggy clothes as a teen   &mdash;  yet despite this I was not only pursued but sexually harrassed. I have come to believe that the latin man might just be the desire of every race of woman but no one desires us stronger then white women do! Its a shame to see a white couple and have their white partner checking me out.</p>
