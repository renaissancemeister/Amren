<p class="bookreview"><i>Black Slaveowners: Free Black Slave Masters in South Carolina, 1790-1860,</i> Larry Koger, University of South Carolina Press, 1985, 286 pp., $14.95 (newly released in paperback) </p>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he myth persists that slavery consisted solely of cruel white masters and exploited blacks. This history of oppression is supposedly responsible for all the troubles blacks face today and, for some blacks, it even justifies reparations. Few people realize that black Americans owned slaves, too. In <i>Black Slaveowners,</i> Larry Koger has written a meticulously researched account of the black, slave-owning elite of South Carolina. </p>
<p>Mr. Koger&rsquo;s purpose is not just to describe the black slaveowning class but to refute the majority academic view that blacks purchased other blacks   &mdash;   primarily their own relatives   &mdash;   in order to set them free. Mr. Koger believes that blacks generally bought, owned, and sold other blacks for economic reasons, just as whites did. </p>
<p>Before the War Between the States, black slaveowners could be found in every slave state and at nearly all educational and economic levels. Mr. Koger reports that, according to the 1830 census, black masters in just four states   &mdash;   Louisiana, Maryland, Virginia and South Carolina   &mdash;   owned more than 10,000 slaves. Even the enlightened state of New York was home to eight black slaveowners. In the South, many pro-slavery whites grew to accept these men and women as neighbors and as allies against abolition. </p>

<th>Blacks generally bought, owned, and sold other blacks for economic reasons, just as whites did.</th></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Mr. Koger reports that by 1840, South Carolina boasted 454 Negro masters with 2,357 slaves. Although only about one in five white households in the South owned slaves, approximately 75 percent of the free black heads of household in the state owned slaves. Many former slaves did not regard slavery as a malevolent institution but as an economic opportunity, and had no qualms about buying other blacks once they were able to. </p>
<p>Who were these black slaveowners? Eighty-three percent were mulattoes, even though they accounted for only 49 percent of all free blacks. Ninety percent of their slaves, by comparison, were of unmixed African descent. A few mixed-race masters inherited slaves from a white parent or grandparent, but most worked and saved on their own to acquire their property. </p>
<p>Mulattoes as a group eventually came to shun all dark-skinned blacks, slave and free, whom they viewed as beneath them. According to the 1860 census, nine out of ten mulattoes chose mixed-race spouses. Their dislike for darker blacks was so pronounced that if a free mulatto woman could not find a mixed-race free man to marry, she might marry a mulatto slave rather than a free black. </p>
<p>Mulattoes had advantages that were both social and biological. Between 1800 and 1840, the average earnings of the wealthiest free, dark-skinned blacks was only $1,805 while the mulatto elite&rsquo;s average came to $4,642. To highlight the differences, mixed-race blacks of South Carolina formed the Brown Fellowship Society. Membership was limited to &#8220;free brown men&#8221; (mulattoes) and included a number of slaveowners. </p>
<p>Some free mulattoes kept their distance from blacks for fear of being mistaken for slaves. Others strongly identified with whites and wanted to preserve the right to own slaves. During the War Between the States many mulatto slaveowners wholly supported the Confederacy. One wrote to his white associates: &#8220;in our veins flows the blood of the white race, in some half, in others more than half  &hellip; our attachments are with you, our hopes and safety and protection from you  &hellip; our allegiance is due to South Carolina and in her defense we will offer up our lives, and all that is dear to us.&#8221; </p>
<p>After the war, when the fear of being mistaken for a slave had past, mulattoes continued to see themselves as above pure blacks. According to Mr. Koger, they refused to attend church with them and even tried to set up a caste system based on pre-war social strata. </p>
<p>It may be that relations between Charleston&rsquo;s mulattoes and full-blooded blacks were permanently soured by events that took place between 1818 and 1822. With the help of 4,000 sympathetic slaves, a free black named Denmark Vesey plotted to lead the blacks of Charleston in a violent uprising. Vesey&rsquo;s supporters had located stockpiles of weapons to seize. One slave vowed he had access to &#8220;a keg of Powder and five hundred (500) muskets.&#8221; </p>
<p>The plan was not just to fight for freedom but to kill every white in the city. For blacks who felt hesitant about butchering whites, Vesey invoked Old Testament parallels to God&rsquo;s chosen people exterminating their enemies. A religious eclectic, he also entreated one co-conspirator, an Angolan mystic named Gullah Jack, to produce a magic potion to protect the rebels from harm. He further inspired his followers by recounting how the blacks of Santo Domingo rose up, massacring scores of white families in the name of freedom. </p>
<p>Vesey excluded free blacks from his plan. All of his closest accomplices were, unlike himself, slaves. Vesey, who was born and &#8220;nurtured in the bosom of Africa,&#8221; also kept mulattoes out of the plot because of their ties to whites and the slaveowning class. </p>
<p>The divisions among Charleston blacks were so complete that Vesey was able to keep his plans secret for four years. Ultimately, it was a mulatto slave who betrayed the insurrection just two weeks before it was to start. South Carolina&rsquo;s Governor asked for federal troops to protect the city. Then Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun, dispatched them, and all the rebel leaders were arrested within two weeks. </p>
<p>The plot   &mdash;   and its betrayal   &mdash;   deepened divisions between blacks and browns. Both groups used the event to justify their suspicions of the other and it may have removed the doubts of some free mulattoes about owning human property. </p>
<p><b>The Woodson Thesis</b> </p>
<table class="boxright">

<p>Black slavemasters are an embarrassment to the orthodox, and have generally been justified by means of &#8220;the Woodson thesis.&#8221; In 1924, historian Carter G. Woodson hypothesized that blacks were &#8220;benevolent&#8221; owners who bought spouses and relatives for the purpose of freeing them. Mr. Koger&rsquo;s analysis refutes this claim. He has discovered that 65 percent of purchases of slaves by blacks in the city of Charleston were clearly motivated by profit and only eight percent could be called &#8220;benevolent.&#8221; He could not determine the motive for the remaining 27 percent. </p>
<p>Several benevolent transactions are detailed in the text, including one 1817 purchase by a black man of his wife. Interestingly, for reasons Mr. Koger does not appear to know, the man kept his wife as a slave for two years before freeing her. </p>
<p>From 1820 until the war, the South Carolina legislature began limiting manumission to extraordinary circumstances, such as life-saving heroism. This made it even less likely that free blacks would buy slaves in order to free them, because it became next to impossible to do so. A few, though, did find ways around the new laws by deeding their slaves to friends or sympathizers with a written agreement that the slaves be allowed to live as if they were free. Some of these nominal slaves worked for wages and paid taxes. One, Hannah Gonzales, even bought and sold slaves herself. </p>
<p>&#8220;Benevolent&#8221; ownership was unusual because, as Mr. Koger often points out, black slaveowners felt little pity for slaves. Some historians have been misled by the large number of black slave holders who did purchase relatives. Many, though, bought additional slaves for strictly economic reasons. Mr. Koger surmises that for them, &#8220;slavery was an oppressive institution when it affected a beloved relative or a friend, but beyond that realm, slavery was viewed as a profit-making institution to be exploited.&#8221; </p>
<p>Black slaveowners took an entirely business-like attitude towards their property. They went to court to fight for their ownership interests, and appear to have been no more likely than whites to free slaves in their wills. Like whites, blacks used their slaves as collateral; one slaveowner in Charleston even mortgaged her two children, born as slaves, to secure a debt. </p>
<p>Like all careful students of slavery, Mr. Koger finds that it was not always the harsh existence modern portrayals suggest. Would Alex Haley&rsquo;s fictional character, Kunta Kinte, have dared a dangerous escape to return to his master if he had been captured by the British during the Revolutionary War? Mr. Koger tells of one slave who did. He reports that, contrary to what is usually believed, many former slaves &#8220;harbored no ill feelings toward their former masters and showed no signs of deep hatred for the institution that enslaved them.&#8221; </p>
<p>Blacks, like whites, could nevertheless be cruel masters. It was not uncommon for black slaveowners to throw insubordinate servants in jail or the workhouse for up to thirty days, and flog them severely when they got out. If a recently purchased slave was unruly, the owner would often resell it, using the proceeds to buy more compliant property. </p>

<th>&#8220;The colored masters of Charleston perceived the [Yankee] invasion as apocalyptic destruction rather than salvation.&#8221;</th></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Blacks owned slaves until the fall of the Confederacy. Even in 1864, during the darkest days of the war, half of Charleston&rsquo;s black slaveowners who had owned slaves in 1860 still owned them. In the early 1860s, some blacks felt optimistic enough to purchase slaves for the first time. In the final months of the war, many black slaveowners either tried to sell to whomever would buy or persisted in using their labor until the conquering Union armies forced them to stop. Very few willingly emancipated their property. As Mr. Koger writes, &#8220;the colored masters of Charleston perceived the invasion as apocalyptic destruction rather than salvation.&#8221; He estimates that emancipation cost Charleston&rsquo;s black masters $216,000 in slave-property   &mdash;   a large loss for just one city. </p>
<p><i>Black Slaveowners</i> is a fascinating look at a misunderstood era of American history, but Mr. Koger is sometimes a little too free with his personal opinions, especially about would-be mass-murderer, Denmark Vesey. We learn that Vesey had &#8220;a certain sparkle in [his] eyes&#8221; and was wealthy enough to own slaves had it not been for the &#8220;racial pride [that] ran through his veins.&#8221; After his conviction, he &#8220;fac[ed] the gallows with courage.&#8221; Mr. Koger sums up, with these words, the man who planned the murder of every white man, woman, and child in Charleston: &#8220;Denmark Vesey showed his followers in life how to be a proud black man, urging the slaves to be men and to take their freedom; he also showed them how to die with conviction.&#8221; </p>Nevertheless, Larry Koger&rsquo;s study of black slaveowners and his refutation of the theory of &#8220;benevolent Negro slaveowners&#8221; is as welcome as it is well researched. His investigations may force scholars to revise their assumptions about the peculiar institution and its supporters

          <i>Andrew Durnford: A Black Sugar Planter in the Antebellum South,</i>by David O. Whitten, Transaction Publishers, 1995, 133 pp., $29.95.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="dropcap">W</span>hat was life like for a black slaveowner? In <i>Andrew Durnford,</i>
 David O. Whitten has drawn on the correspondence between a free, 
mulatto master and his lifelong white friend to give us a glimpse into a
 forgotten corner of the American past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Andrew Durnford was said to be the child of a free black woman
 and her wealthy English lover, Thomas Durnford. Thomas gave his son an 
aristocratic education that included French, mathematics, and medicine. 
Although the most that illegitimate mulatto children could usually hope 
for was freedom upon the death of their fathers, Andrew inherited both 
Thomas Durnford&rsquo;s name and a portion of his estate. He subscribed to 
periodicals in both French and English, and valued education enough to 
send his own son to Lafayette College in Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <table class="boxright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="/news/ar/1996/05/slave.gif" alt="" width="190" align="right" height="190" /> </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          John McDonogh had been a close friend and business partner of 
Durnford&rsquo;s father, Thomas. When Thomas Durnford died, owing almost 
$10,000 to McDonogh, McDonogh was granted curatorship over the estate. 
His association with Durnford&rsquo;s son was a crucial advantage to the young
 mulatto. In 1831, McDonogh set up Andrew Durnford as a planter, selling
 to him   &mdash;   on credit   &mdash;   14 slaves and 672 acres of land along the 
Mississippi. McDonogh clearly had an abiding affection for Durnford and 
appears to have treated him as a social equal. He helped Durnford 
acquire yet more property, and by 1835, Durnford owned 77 slaves and 
more than 1600 acres of land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Durnford was not a successful businessman. He was able to 
cover the costs of running his plantation for only two out of 26 years. 
He owned more slaves than he needed and, according to Mr. Whitten, 
&#8220;would have enjoyed greater financial returns had he put his capital out
 at interest and employed himself at salary.&#8221; He lived comfortably, but 
depended on the kindness of his creditor. When he died he still owed 
$13,000 to John McDonogh&rsquo;s survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Whitten writes that Durnford was a kindly master, but he 
appears to have had no illusions about his property. On one occasion he 
wrote of his &#8220;rascally Negroes,&#8221; saying &#8220;I have to threaten them 
severely to get them to do their dutys  &hellip;&#8221; 
When slaves were incapable of a job, he often hired Dutch or German free
 hands. When slaves escaped, Durnford sent his overseer to track them 
down. Of one disobedient slave he wrote, &#8220;I ordered five round [lashes] 
to be given him yesterday  &hellip; He is a wicked fellow.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Though John McDonogh freed 85 of his blacks and set them up 
with jobs in Liberia, Durnford thought it was foolish to free slaves, 
since he thought they could not care for themselves: &#8220;There is not one 
in a hundred that could save money. They have not the moral courage to 
deprive themselves of luxuries.&#8221; During his life he freed only four 
slaves   &mdash;   a laborer in his 50s and three mulatto children. McDonogh freed
 all but a few slaves in his will, but Andrew Durnford freed only one at
 his death   &mdash;   an illegitimate child.
        </p>
          Durnford&rsquo;s legitimate son was not a kind master to the slaves 
he inherited. &#8220;The race relationship between this mulatto and the slaves
 may have been more severe than that found between slaves and white 
owners and overseers,&#8221; writes Mr. Whitten. Slavery was, indeed, a vexing
 question, scarcely illuminated by the clichés with which it is 
invariably addressed.

		<p>Slavery exists in many parts of the world today, particularly in North Africa and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. It exists in Haiti, where slaves are known as &#8220;restavecs.&#8221; Why then do we hear constantly about slavery in a country which abolished it 150 years ago? Because, of course, the slaveowners were all (or mostly, as this article tells us) *white*! If slaveowners in Haiti were white we&rsquo;d hear of little else! And we wouldn&rsquo;t be giving them huge amounts of aid!<br>
When the issue of slavery in the U.S. comes up with people, and it comes up more often than I would like, I now always remind them of the above. I also say that all civilizations have had slavery at one time or another, with the slaves often being white. I further say that the U.S. is the only country which has abolished it in the distant past and yet continues to obsess about it a century and a half later!<br>
It&rsquo;s about time we refused to allow ourselves to be beaten up any more over this long-dead issue.<br>

		<p>What would be the reacton of the general public, from both blacks and whites, if a major filmmaker, like Oliver Stone or Steven Spielberg had the courage to make a mainstream movie about American slavery,  In which the &#8220;Massa&#8221; character himself, would be a free black?</p>
<p>What if this movie would portray black slaveowners, as this article points out, as being just as evil, cruel, and oppressive, as were white slaveowners were portrayed in the 1977 &#8220;Roots&#8221; mini-series?</p>
<p>Oops, I just remembered, Steven Spielberg and Oliver Stone are white!  Would a white filmmaker who made such a historically accurate movie be condemned by the mainstream media as a &#8220;racist&#8221;?</p>
<p>Would a black filmmaker and director have a better chance of getting away with making such a movie?  Or would that black filmmaker be condemned by other blacks as an &#8220;Uncle Tom&#8221;?</p>
<p>One thing is certain, if a mainstream movie about free blacks who owned slaves is ever made, as a white person, I would not go to see it at a multi-plex. I would play it safe by waiting until it came out on DVD!</p>

		<p>Very enjoyable and informative read. Several years ago a black co-worker was complaining how slavery was all the white mans fault, when I remarked that many blacks had plantations and slaves he denied it. When I asked him if he thought that whites got off their ships and went into the interior of Africa and captured blacks? He walked away. Slavery in the US started with blacks capturing blacks in Africa, a fact that most US citizens seem to forget, both blacks and whites.</p>

<p>But as for changing current ideas of slavery as it actually existed, I don&rsquo;t see that. Most people would go stark raving mad if they were confronted with that information today. They&rsquo;re not intellectually equipped to injest it. Which is an interesting thing in itself.</p>

		<p>More importantly, the slave trade itself was an enterprise dependent upon black cooperation. Slaves were at first generally prisoners of West Africa&rsquo;s common intertribal wars, sold by Africans to European traders as an alternative to killing them. Whether or not the frequency of these wars, and slave raids by black tribes on other black tribes, increased as a result of the financial incentives provided by the slave trade, the simple fact is that the slave trade occurred primarily because there were numerous Africans who were perfectly happy to make their living enslaving and selling other Africans. While relatively few Europeans engaged in the slave trade, and many regarded the slave trade with disgust, whole kingdoms in West Africa based their economies on this trade, and cherished it as a source of wealth. This is why so many African rulers opposed the efforts by European powers to ban the trade (under pressure from, of course, white abolitionists).</p>

<p>Remember the triangle of commerce.  Captured slaves from Africa were sent to the New World to help harvest raw materials.  Those raw materials were shipped back to established European manufacturing and distilling concerns to make finished dry goods and rum.  Those dry goods and rum were sent to Africa to pay the victorious black men in those intertribal wars, as their reward for proving them with slaves.</p>
<p>Black men captured and sold out other black men for a bottle of rum.  So much for that solidarity against &#8220;da man.&#8221;</p>

		<p>While relatively few Europeans engaged in the slave trade, and many regarded the slave trade with disgust, whole kingdoms in West Africa based their economies on this trade, and cherished it as a source of wealth. This is why so many African rulers opposed the efforts by European powers to ban the trade (under pressure from, of course, white abolitionists).</p>
<p>Only half true. Many europeans were avid supporters of the slave trade givne the immense profit it yielded. Thus, they only decided to end this practice once they realized that the profit motive for such an exercise no longer existed.</p>

		<p>Living in Hispanic USA it always surprises me and astounds me when Hispanics describe another by skin tone, dark, light, etc.  It is a value based system to them&hellip;</p>
<p>If I did that I would get the death penalty.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t white privilege wonderful? The white elite who are very lite skinned should be confronted with empirical experience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many white men have sold out each other for much less than a bottle of rum. The leadership that exists in almost all white countries, has sold out white people for free. They did not even get paid for it. White leaders in America actually consider it a virtue, to give America away to racial aliens.  </p>

		<p>Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers&rsquo; Project, 1936-1938 contains more than 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery and 500 black-and-white photographs of former slaves. These narratives were collected in the 1930s as part of the Federal Writers&rsquo; Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and assembled and microfilmed in 1941 as the seventeen-volume Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves. This online collection is a joint presentation of the Manuscript and Prints and Photographs Divisions of the Library of Congress and includes more than 200 photographs from the Prints and Photographs Division that are now made available to the public for the first time.<br>

For a long time after the Civil War slavery was often portrayed fictionally as a benign institution. Even Gone With the Wind, which was released in 1939 for a national audience, portrayed it that way. More recently, depictions of slavery in the American South present it as an unmitigated evil. <br>
 <br>
In truth, some slaves were treated cruelly, others kindly. Born in Slavery contains autobiographical accounts of either experience. It deserves to be read, or at least perused by those who wish to gain a nuanced appraisal of this institution that continues to shape what is exceptional about the United States. </p>

		<p>I had not previously been aware of the existence of a free mulatto population in the U.S. which regarded itself as apart from, and superior to, the black population, free or slave.</p>
<p> I should not have been surprised; certainly such a population existed and still exists in Haiti and South Africa. In India there is the Anglo-Indian (Eurasian) population which in Imperial times was desperate to be thought British, but was regarded by the British with (at best) kindly condescenscion and by the Indians with contempt for those who pretended to be what they were not and - worse - had the blood of low-caste women in their veins.</p>
<p>So what happened to these free mulattos post-war? Presumably they disappeared as a separate class, merging into the black population for the most part and into the white population if they were capable of passing as white? </p>

		<p>Servitude, like so many other matters, exists along a continuum<br>
and can be measured or rated.  By 1860, there was a lot of hard<br>
headed discussion in portions of Dixie of how wage workers would be more cost effective than chattel slaves.  Maybe the worst<br>
&#8220;throw away&#8221; disregard of humans was the treatment of Chinese<br>
workers in frontier California.(?)</p>
