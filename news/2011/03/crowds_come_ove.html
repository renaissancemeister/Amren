<p>Ambilikile Mwasapile, a 76-year-old retired pastor in rural Tanzania, has been offering a herbal concoction that he bills as a miracle potion that can cure just about any illness. In the past few weeks, tens of thousands of sick people have scrambled for a sip of his homebrewed drink. Some, apparently, have even flown in by helicopter. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Mwasapile, a former Lutheran preacher, lives in Samunge, a village in the middle of the savannah near the Kenya-Tanzania border. He began administering his miracle potion several months ago, and charges about 30 cents a cup. He says it can cure AIDS, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure  &mdash;  you name it. </p>

<p>However, it was found to be absolutely useless as a cure for stupidity, which somebody suggested was why he sold so much of it. <br>

		<p>Imagine you are a black african and you have flown in by helicopter (bought from aid money) and paid 30 cents for a cup of magic elixir, you would not, in any circumstances whatsoever, admit that it didn&rsquo;t work! Blacks anywhere do not admit they are ever wrong. It&rsquo;s always someone else&rsquo;s fault. Remember the magic &#8216;diesel rock&rsquo; in Zimbabwe? A sangoma named &#8216;Nomatter&rsquo; convinced her glorious leader Mugabe that she could bring forth diesel by hitting a rock with a stick. Uncle Bob awarded her $2.7 million as a gift. When the nearby hidden tanker ran out of diesel, she was arrested but entranced the court with a spell. Mugabe was really miffed by all this as he obviously did all in his power to make Zimbabwe self-sufficient in diesel fuel and claimed &ldquo;Her trickery brought despondency in the nation,&rdquo;.. poor nation, and it was so happy and prosperous under his rule before this spirit medium committed a blatant act of treason and ruined everything by supplying &ldquo;false information to the state&rdquo;.  In a few years time, the magic diesel rock will probably become a top tourist attraction and be named &#8216;Mount Gullible&rsquo;. Perhaps if a cup of this Tanzanian elixir was poured over the rock, the fuel will gush once more, or perhaps not. Tee Hee!!  </p>

		<p>He isn&rsquo;t very ambitious is he? Thirty cents a cup for medicine is NOTHING to the rates these snake-oil purveyors usually charge their desperate but poverty-stricken fellow tribesmen. In some cases hope and a positive mental outlook can go a long way towards helping the body find at least temporary relief from pain, so I suppose it&rsquo;s all good, as long as it&rsquo;s in Kenya, not here. Witchdoctors have been around since the beginning of time.</p>

<p><br>
According to South Africa&rsquo;s President Jacob Zuma, there&rsquo;s no need for a magical elixir from some Tanzanian snake-oil salesman. According to Zuma, all you need to do to stay safe and healthy after knowingly having unprotected sex with an HIV+ partner, is to wash yourself with soap and water in a nice, hot, post-coital shower: </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma_rape_trial" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma_rape_trial</a></p>
<p>The brilliant Pres. Zuma&rsquo;s AIDS cure saves 30 cents   &mdash;   not to mention the price of a helicopter trip to Tanzania!</p>
<p>And Zuma should know   &mdash;   he was, after all, head of SA&rsquo;s National AIDS Council at the time. Are you going to doubt an authority like that? </p>

<p>I should say that that must be some really smart holy water   &mdash;   To believe this story, those water droplets have the ability to tell, just by landing on a person&rsquo;s skin, whether the person is chained to other people, the person&rsquo;s gender, the state of the person&rsquo;s undress.</p>

		<p>In Tanzania, the killing of albinos whose body parts are reportedly used to make charms has caused global consternation.   But even when witchcraft is not making the headlines, it is still a daily issue in Africa. The practitioners and their victims believe in powers that simply do not exist. Sometimes belief in the dark arts is attributed to mass poverty and state failure to &#8216;modernize&rsquo; the outlook especially of people living in the rural areas. It is argued that if people were better educated and had access to adequate health care they would understand that illness is caused by germs and not witchcraft.  But these explanations miss the biggest point. They fail to place witchcraft within the persistent African worldview. Belief in witchcraft is part and parcel of the moral universe as understood in African Traditional Religion. Contrary to popular belief, African Religion is still alive and well.  In African religious thought, the universe created by God ought to be harmonious, balanced and good. But mysterious evil powers exist that disrupt this order. Evil originates not merely from the breaking of taboos and other laws, but from spiritual, mystical powers at work in the universe.  The eminent Tanzanian theologian Fr. Laurent Magesa explains that witchcraft is supernatural. The witch is a person possessing or possessed of, or by, supernatural forces which he or she uses knowingly or unknowingly, selectively or indiscriminately, to harm others often for no apparent reason. Magesa writes that &#8220;evil, in the African perception, is always incarnated; it does not exist except as it exists in the evil person, that is, in the witch.&#8221;  So, how can belief in witchcraft be eradicated? This is hardly possible. According to Fr. Magesa, &#8220;in African Religion, witchcraft must be understood as part of the mystery of the human person&#8221;. Witchcraft is therefore central to the understanding of morality and ethics among Africans. &#8220;In the African mentality, everything wrong or bad in society and in the world, and most particularly various afflictions, originates in witchcraft. There is no kind of illness or hardship at all that may not ultimately be attributed to witchcraft&#8221;.  Belief in witchcraft shall therefore persist as long as African Traditional Religion exerts influence on Africans. </p>

		<p>What amazes me isn&rsquo;t that people will seek out quack medicine. That&rsquo;s been part of the human condition forever. </p>
<p>What amazes me is people will use the products of modern science and engineering to seek out something that is so blatantly pre-modern. </p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s my question: are the flying machines, cars, medicine, and mobile phones the West provides so little understood that these seemingly magical devices actually reinforce belief in magical concoctions? </p>

<p>Some of the most cutting remarks about that phenomenon I&rsquo;ve ever heard were made by another Chinese.  One of my labmates in grad school at UNSW Sydney remarked that once rhinos and big cats are extinct, half of the men in China and southeast Asia will be impotent.</p>

		<p>@Michael Scott: I wonder if part of what drives the Asian interest in endangered animal parts is a desire status. Snorting powdered bear parts might not cure anything, but if you can afford to do it, it validates that one is successful. </p>

No, it would not be cyanide as a simple poison but cyanide as an evil spell. Cyanide is harmless without the spell and the fact that someone wants to do evil. See my post #9. Just how much of this voodoo lingers within the black african populations of UK/USA even after many generations in our civilized countries will remain a deep dark secret as they will certainly not discuss the subject with non-africans. However, on the fringes, there is ample evidence at spiritual revival meetings where the congregation is whipped up into a frenzy of hollering and fainting attacks following &#8216;laying on of hands&rsquo; along with collections of cash &#8216;for the church&rsquo;. No one will ever convince me that the multitude of very young black children who are dragged along to witness such activities remain unaffected.</p>
