<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Immigrants from most Latin American countries sent home substantially more money at the beginning of 2011 than they did a year earlier, signaling the economic recovery in the U.S. and other developed countries has improved prospects for foreign workers.</p>
<p>Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico received between 6% and 16% more revenue from remittances in January than in the same month last year, according to the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The exception was Brazil, which experienced a 3% decline, said the U.N. agency.</p>
<p>Funds remitted to Latin American countries rose 6% and 16% in January, compared to the year-earlier month.</p>
<p>The January figures, coupled with 2010 data to be released Monday by the Inter-American Development Bank, confirms the end of a downward trend in remittance flows, which had tumbled 15% between 2008 and 2009 as the recession took its toll.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The funds channeled home by immigrants are critical to their families and to many developing countries, where remittances exceed foreign direct investment, provide hard currency for government acquisitions and help spur economic growth.</p>
<p>The purchasing power of remittances has weakened, however, for families in countries where local currencies have appreciated against the dollar.</p>
<p>Currencies in Latin America gained 4.4%, on average, against the dollar during 2010, according to the IDB report. In particular, &#8220;the appreciation of the Brazilian real and the peso in Colombia makes a big impact on people receiving remittances from the United States,&#8221; said Robert Meins, a remittance expert at the IFAD.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Mexico, the appreciation of the peso and inflation have also adversely affected recipients of remittances, but to a lesser extent than in Brazil and Colombia.</p>
<p>In January, remittance flows to Mexico jumped 5.8% over the same month in 2010, and the average value of each remittance rose nearly 1% to almost $300 compared to January last year. Once the remittances were converted into pesos and inflation was discounted, their real value shrunk by 3.2% in January relative to the same month last year.</p>

		<p>The headline is wrong:  if they are sending money &#8220;home&#8221;, then they can&rsquo;t be &#8220;migrants&#8221;, because home is still somewhere else.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s revolting how this article spins the issue and purposefully leaves out the important facts.</p>
<p>One is left with an image of poor people from mexico, coming to the US, working hard and sending what they can, back to their families&hellip;&hellip;not even close to reality except for a tiny handful of people.</p>
<p>Most money that mexicans get comes from either, scams to directly steal from welfare in all its very many forms, from the welfare &#8220;mother&#8221; who had no actual kids (and many assumed/stolen identities) to the guy who buys a new house every few days, disappearing with the down payment and leaving it in escrow to all the fast food restaurants the big corporations roll out unlimited funds for (that they will never see again) while demanding millions of dollars underwrite you if you are white.  Mexicas STEAL from us&hellip;.ALOT.</p>
<p>Put that pales in comparison to the actual labor they provide&hellip;.in the form of the drug trade.  All those blacks on multi-generational welfare spend a significant amount of their handouts in return for street drugs that mexicans provide.</p>
<p>That is where the &#8220;remittances&#8221; are coming from.  So where are they going&hellip;.families?  Hahahahahaha.  No.  You may have noticed how very powerful the drug cartels have become&hellip;.cutting off people&rsquo;s heads with impunity, left and right&hellip;..and well, a whole book can be written on the new level of gruesome evil these people are.  And you&rsquo;ll have to read that book to&hellip;..rarely will you see it reported in the news.</p>
<p>So powerful are these people they think they can overthrow the mexican government and a good chunk of the US.</p>
<p>They may be right.</p>
<p>Of course, they could be stopped dead if only the truth were acted on. Robert Meins here knows the truth, of course.  Who does he work for?</p>

<p>Recovery?  </p>
<p>The right leaning WSJ can be as deceptive as the radical leftists.  </p>
<p>They just LOVE that cheap labor to keep their lawns mowed and to enrich themselves by forcing the peons to work for reduced wages.</p>

		<p>I wonder why the Mexican Peso is gaining value against the U.S. dollar?  Hmm, could it be all the influx of U.S. dollars that magically appear in Mexico?  How do they get there?  That and the U.S. constantly printing more dollars.</p>
<p>Western Union refuses to cooperate with the U.S. in figuring out how much money is leaving the country and offering discounts to places south of the border.  Go after them.  Tax them a large sum to send money out of the U.S. to any country.  It would help pay for everything those people destroy. </p>

		<p>Well,, since we are throwing around unsubstantiated theories of why remittances to Latin America have picked up e.g. &#8220;economic recovery&#8221;, I have another theory.  All the illegals who have walked out on their martgages are now living in the same homes for free until a backlogged foreclosure can occur or they have moved into another residence with three other families. Now that they don&rsquo;t have those troublesome house notes to worry about, they can send a few more bucks home.</p>

		<p>Underlying sublimal message Miriam Jordan??  &mdash;  - So I&rsquo;m suppossed to bear yet another white man US citizen&rsquo;s burden for the devastating effects of inflation in my own country (in which as a co-conspirator, I, John Dawg Plebe of course was a major influential player) and consequent currency exchange rates that have adversely (for the remitter) affected the net transfer of wealth from here to Latin America by illegal invaders from Latin America?? Really??</p>

		<p>Cry me a river invaders, because white Americans are getting screwed over thrice because of you. For one, we pay more in taxes because of you, and those taxes that go to welfare for illegals and third world immigrants fuel the drug trade. They will also fuel the coming armed insurrection against us in our own land, along with the terrorism against us underway now. Second that leaves us less money, along with the downward pressure on our incomes because of the cheap labor your ilk are. Thirdly, your ilk makes living more expensive, stressful, crowded, dangerous, unpleasant and alienating for us because of your kind being aided and abetted by our ruling class. So no, you get no sympathy from me, you get hostility and contempt.</p>
