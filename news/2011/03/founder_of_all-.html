<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-africa/20110316/AF.Obit.Boshoff/">Founder of All-White South Africa Community Dies</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jenny Gross, Comcast News, March 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The founder of South Africa&rsquo;s whites-only, separatist town Orania died of cancer Wednesday, says a spokeswoman for the community. He was 83.</p>
<p>Carel Boshoff founded the privately owned town of 900 people, located in South Africa&rsquo;s northern province, in 1991 as South Africa transitioned from a white-ruled apartheid government to a democracy. Orania&rsquo;s goal was to preserve the culture of Afrikaners, one of South Africa&rsquo;s white minority groups. Its residents speak Afrikaans, sing traditional folk songs, attend the Dutch Reformed Church and celebrate Afrikaans holidays.</p>
<p>Although Boshoff championed the exclusive community, he wasn&rsquo;t a typical white separatist. A professor of theology, he worked in Soweto, one of South Africa&rsquo;s largest black townships, and was paid visits by prominent members of South Africa&rsquo;s black majority party. Visitors included South Africa&rsquo;s first black president, Nelson Mandela, current President Jacob Zuma and other political leaders within mostly black South Africa.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The youth league of the African National Congress released a statement Wednesday which said the youth league was &#8220;saddened&#8221; by the news, and that unlike other right-wing forces, Boshoff was &#8220;always willing to engage with other people.&#8221; The statement said Boshoff had &#8220;maximum prospects of understanding and embracing non-racialism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strydom said a lot of people still think the Orania community is racist, &#8220;but it was never founded on that basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are of a very small group in South Africa and when we are spread out all over the country and it&rsquo;s difficult to commemorate what we are and be true to our own identity.&#8221;</p>
<p>[University of Johannesburg&rsquo;s vice chancellor Adam] Habib said Orania&rsquo;s &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; ideology is impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ideas he stood for are ideas that are not compatible with the modern world. If those ideas were allowed to percolate and spread, the world would be a much more destructive place than it already is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Take out the diamond mining industry, the only thing keeping South Africa from becoming a total basket case like Zimbabwe, and Orania would probably be more prosperous than all of black South Africa in the aggregate.</p>

		<p>Afrikaner will be killed or they will flee. There is no other possible outcome.<br>
Afrikaners cannot be left alone..they will arouse the resentment<br>
envy and hatred of blacks..not as a result of Afrikaner success or<br>
pride. Carl Boshoff suppressed that aspect. No, whites will be<br>
hated as  a result of inevitable black failure, which is a spiral that knows no bottom. There can be an attempt at &#8220;separate&#8221; <br>
but their can never be an &#8220;equal&#8221; South Africa simply because whites simply cannot follow<br>
blacks down to their level.</p>

<p>If this is indeed true, then why has S. Africa transitioned from a nearly first world country to a third world, crime ridden, rape capital, economic failure along with the departure of apartheid?  If this professor wants to see destructive places, all he has to do is wait for the remaining western nations to become sufficiently racially balkanized to encourage the white population to take action.  Maybe not though, my short time on this earth has shown me that most whites are cowards and unwilling to discuss uneasy truths.  But, times have also been economically good for us.  And that certainly won&rsquo;t continue.</p>

<p>Self-reliance is a bad thing?  Not murdering and killing others is a bad thing?  Not exploiting others or your own is a bad thing?  Preserving your own culture, people and language is a bad thing?  Sounds like Japan on a small scale.  Sounds like what the Tibetans would like to have (or did I miss something and they joined China voluntarily?).  Or is it only bad when whites preserve themselves. Mr. Habib (doesn&rsquo;t sound too Afrikanns, now does it?).</p>
<p>The Amish practise something similar in this country.  Actually the world would be a better place if we all lived more like Orania.</p>

Interpretation: &#8220;Whiteness is not compatible with the modern world.&#8221;</p>
<p>We agree.  A world that allows White liberal elites to spread hate against their own White grandchildren is a world that doesn&rsquo;t deserve all that Whites have contributed to easing misery and suffering around the globe.   If it weren&rsquo;t for misguide &#8220;compassionate&#8221; Whites, most of the world&rsquo;s population would have a life expectancy of about 30.</p>
<p>Follow the future:</p>
<p>Making White babies is a hate crime against global dignity.</p>
<p>White Humanity is a hate crime against global dignity.</p>
<p>We must eradicate hate crime.</p>
<p>Whites cannot be victims- they are a legitimate target in all circumstances, and those who attack Whites are our global heroes.<br>

		<p>Who is Adam Habib? Nobody in South-Africa has ever even heard of Adam Habib, he seems ignorant. Orania will continue to prosper and grow at there own rate. I will be visiting the town in April for a short holiday and some spiritual tranquillity.</p>

		<p>Afrikaners need to protect themselves.  The ANC menaces their very existence.  There are many Afrikaners who now live in abject poverty.  The have been sold out by the British South Africans, who aren&rsquo;t really Africans. Remember that the British put Many thousands of Afrikaner women and children in concentration camps during the Boer war because they could not defeat Afrikaners on the field of battle. So the &#8220;brave&#8221; khakis imprisoned the families of Afrikaners. Yet they were determined to take over the country because of its mineral wealth.  South Africa was built by Afrikaners, then stolen by the British.<br>
 Perhaps the Afrikaners need to follow the Israeli model.  They need a Haganah, their own homeland and plenty of guns to defend themselves.  The should never trust a Khaki or an American again.</p>

		<p>His views aren&rsquo;t &#8220;compatible with the modern world.&#8221; That&rsquo;s probably true. The modern world seeks to destroy all fruitful and beneficial distinctions, and thereby unite mankind at the lowest common level of envy, greed, and self-indulgence. The modern world must die so that true humanity can live.  </p>

<p>&#8220;The Amish practise something similar in this country.&#8221;<br>
Exactly</p>
<p>All this group of Afrikaners (about 800+) have done is create a town where they are 100% self sufficient and assist one another as and when required.<br>
Through diligence and hard work they have become commercially successful - not rich - but are not a drain on anyone<br>
An additional dimension to their community is rejecting what was &#8220;the traditional South African way of life&#8221; - reliance on &#8220;cheap&#8221; black labour.<br>
In other words they now operate in exactly the same way as a multitude of small farming communities seen is Europe.<br>
Each enterprise is fully mechanised and small enough to be managed by a family, without the need to even employ contract labour<br>
The American &#8220;Mom and Pop&#8221; model springs to mind</p>
<p>If it can be good enough for Lancaster County Pennsylvania  USA why can it not be good enough for Orania RSA?</p>

		<p>It would be an irony indeed if the only place in the world where an intact white community still existed in a century from now were to be in Africa. Yet such is the way of the world that if Orania survives it might well be that place.</p>
<p>That is a big &#8220;if&#8221; -  but a coherent, orderly, self-supporting community like Orania does have a good chance of weathering the storms ahead. Pray that Orania survives and thrives.</p>

		<p>Orania must be the only sane place in South Africa. It is probably the only place where there is virtually no crime and it is the reason why many of these white residents have not left the country as many of their countrymen have. The Black population is and was never ready to control South Africa. They are largely unskilled and uneducated and prone to crime.</p>

		<p>Adam Habib is right, in a sense.  As the rest of black and brown South Africa falls apart while white Orania does nothing but grow and prosper, violence will most certainly happen.</p>
<p>Nothing like greed and envy to kick start a war.  Especially when you outnumber your victims over a thousand to one.<br>
