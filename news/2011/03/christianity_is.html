			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Cristina Odone, Telegraph (London), March 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s official: Britain is no longer a Christian nation. In banning Eunice and Owen Johns, a devout Christian couple, from fostering children, Lord Justice Munby and Mr Justice Beatson declared that we live in a secular state, and that the Johns&rsquo; religious convictions disqualified them from raising citizens of that state. We&rsquo;ve outgrown Christianity, the judges professed. Instead, we have graduated to the status of a multicultural nation, blessed by a plurality of faiths.</p>
<p>Ironically, the justices who have pronounced that Britain is no longer Christian did so in a court where witnesses swear on the Bible and invoke God&rsquo;s help in telling the truth. I do not imagine that these judges leave out the first word in &#8220;God Save the Queen&#8221;  &mdash;  nor would they shun an invitation to the Royal wedding, which is happening not at a registry office but the centrepiece of official Christendom, Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>In taking part in these traditions, the judges  &mdash;  and the rest of us  &mdash;  are no different from past generations. For Christianity is not merely a part of life here, a provider of schools, hospitals and orphanages. It is the backbone of our laws, the impetus for the charity, justice and tolerance that have long been characteristic of this country. Its grand principles have inspired citizens to extraordinary actions, such as William Wilberforce&rsquo;s campaign against slavery, and to ordinary kindnesses, such as reading to hospital patients or delivering meals on wheels. When David Cameron speaks of our moral duty to our Arab brothers, or shares his vision for the Big Society, he taps not into narrow party allegiance, but into our common Christian heritage.</p>
<p>The Christians of an earlier era may not have known about multiculturalism, or predicted that it would be the signature tune of our times. Yet their faith gave them a moral imperative that demanded respect for others: &#8220;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&#8221; Without this moral underpinning, multiculturalism sags into a factionalism of competing demands and conflicting interests. Instead, the Gospel&rsquo;s commandment inspires the Christian majority to accommodate Jewish, Muslim, atheist and Hindu minorities, without losing sight of the basic principle of mutual respect.</p>
<p>This, indeed, is one of the reasons why non-Christian believers are so passionate in wanting to protect Christianity as a presence in public life. Jews, like Muslims, recognise that while Christians  &mdash;  and especially Anglicans  &mdash;  may enjoy a special status, their faith embraces all people as made, and loved, by God. The Act of Succession, which bans us Catholics from the throne, makes me angry; but like all members of a religious minority, I feel safer in a culture that cherishes spiritual values than in one that rubbishes them.</p>
<p>So it is not just Christians that the ruling in the Johns case will alarm and unsettle. As the judges wagged their fingers about the secularist principles that, they claim, define the nation (and which &#8220;ought to be, but seemingly are not, well understood&#8221;), they were not describing the status quo: a strong majority of Britons still consider themselves to be Christian. Instead, they were making clear their desire to steer this country in a direction of their own choosing  &mdash;  one that matches the views of an increasingly strident group that is determined to scrub Christianity from public life.</p>
<p>Its efforts to push the majority faith underground are evident everywhere, from our bus stops to our workplaces. The British Humanist Association is campaigning to discourage &#8220;cultural Christians&#8221; from identifying themselves as believers in the forthcoming census. Jo Johnson, a Tory MP, wants to drop the prayer that traditionally opens Parliamentary sessions. Companies like BA forbid their Christian staff from wearing crosses to work. Schools and offices present Christian holidays as secular breaks. And now devout Christians are to be prevented from becoming foster parents.</p>
<p>According to our learned judges, &#8220;the aphorism that &#8216;Christianity is part of the common law of England&rsquo; is now mere rhetoric&#8221;. How excruciatingly unjust.<br>

		<p>For AmRen readers who are unfamiliar with this case, the Johns are a black Christian couple who wished to be foster parents. Their application was denied because they refused to promise that they would teach children in their care that homosexuality was just as valid a lifestyle as heterosexuality. Does this mean that Muslims, who plan on throwing gays off tall buildings, can&rsquo;t be foster parents? No prizes for the correct answer to this one!<br>
This was the second anti-Christian ruling by British courts in the last few weeks. <br>
In the first, a Christian couple who ran a bed-and-breakfast were targeted by a gay legal group and taken to court for discrimination because they refused to rent a double room to two gay men. They lost their case and were bankrupted from the legal costs. This was in spite of the fact that their policy was actually to refuse to allow any unmarried couples, gay or straight, to share a room!<br>
In a related development, a gay legal group (perhaps the same one) has targeted a female psychotherapist who uses a therapy partly based on Biblical teachings to convert gays to a heterosexual lifestyle. (Good luck with that!) The gay group sent a man in to pretend to request therapy from her and when she explained her approach, told her that this was exactly what he was looking for. He now hopes to testify against her, charging &#8220;discrimination,&#8221; at a meeting of the organization which licenses psychotherapists in Britain. If she loses, she will never be able to work as a therapist again.<br>
We all know that Muslims, who are rabidly anti-gay, will never be harassed by these liberals.<br>
We also know that effective attacks on Christianity are effective attacks on the glue that helps bind Western civilization. </p>

		<p>Sadly, this coming Sunday, most mainstream Christian churches will be struggling just to keep their doors open with mainly white elderly congregations. Some Churches will be preaching tolerance, social justice and even a dialog with Islam. In other words nothing to do with traditional Christian or Western society&rsquo;s values.<br>
Some churches will have the likes of Jesse Jackson in the pulpit preaching an even stranger gospel which I understand includes &#8220;hate whitey&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the local Mosque will be full to overflowing and they will most certainly not be preaching about the accommodation of Christianity or it&rsquo;s values.</p>
<p>Make a small start, attend and support your local mainstream Christian Church. If enough of us start doing this the politicians may take notice of Christian values again.</p>

		<p>As a European-American agnostic gay man, I find this incredibly insane.</p>
<p>To deny someone the right to children because of their religious beliefs is just as bad as denying someone the right to children because of their sexuality. As long as they aren&rsquo;t teaching the children to go about slaughtering everyone then I don&rsquo;t see what the issue is. </p>
<p><br>
It seems they have a very poor understanding of what &ldquo;secular&rdquo; means. Secular nation is a nation that has a time for its religion and another time for politics, both separate from one another. Being secular does not mean discriminating against and attacking religious people.  Then again, this isn&rsquo;t the first time the British took something like equality or secular ideas too far. It is either this or that, with no in-between.</p>
<p><br>
I am a gay agnostic, yet I understand the cultural significance of Christianity and its importance to my ancestors. I find this constant need to cleanse society of any Christian remnants is very similar to the need to wipe paganism out of Europe. <br>
Could you imagine Europe without cathedrals? Without saints? Without the unification, which Christianity brought? Without Christmas, Easter, etc?</p>
<p>No, no, I want no part in this blasphemy!</p>

		<p>If the justices believe that the nation has outgrown Christianity, then why would it be worthy to note that other faiths now inhabit the kingdom?</p>
<p>I must admit that this case is troubling, because the justices did not reject all faiths, which would effectively prevent everyone from being foster parents, but ONLY the Christian faith.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been expecting another front to open up in the battle against Christianity. Christianity opposes homosexuality and abortion, both of which are legal activities. Sometimes we hear about court cases against fervent Christians when there is the threat violence or physical harassment. But I think the courts will go much further and restrict any negative words or teachings against these legal activities. A citizen should be free to go about their daily life without feeling demeaned or being afraid of judgemental Christians. </p>
<p>In the long run I think Christianity will come to accept these activities as being normal. Already many Christians are compromised because they are surrounded by such people every day and yet must deal with them as normal people. I&rsquo;m not sure what will be done about gamblers or porn viewers as these are legal activities as well but I suppose the same argument can be made that they should not be demeaned.</p>

		<p>Like #5, I am also agnostic. But I also recognize and support the importance of Christianity in society. </p>
<p>I believe the radicals want to &#8220;eradicate&#8221; Christianity for the same reason the Communists did   &mdash;   it interferes with their agenda. They want to tear it down and replace it with something else. I&rsquo;m not sure what they want to replace it with. But it can&rsquo;t be good or they wouldn&rsquo;t have to go about doing it this way.</p>

<p>I know you are talking about the UK, but&hellip;</p>
<p>In the 1970&rsquo;s I told people that the Berlin wall would come down when the U.S. became a communist country and not when the Soviet Union became a free country. People laughed at me.</p>
<p>In 1989 when the Berlin wall came down, I told people people that the communist now feel secure that the U.S. will become a communist country. People laughed at me.</p>
<p>Last year a very small amount of people agreed that the U.S. was becoming a communist country, but many people still laugh.</p>
<p>Communism is just like a parasitic Hermit Crab. When it outlives and destroys its old country, it finds a new one. The U.S. is its new shell and feeding ground. The U.K. is just a rest stop.</p>
<p>For those who may believe what I say, I can assure you that this was not the first time communism ruled North America, and it will get much much worse than it is today. The first communism was the Aztec empire. Pure communism. One ruling class that sacrificed the ruled class. I can assure you that in the future the only thing different between the communist empire and the Aztec Empire will be the time, technology to rule the people, and the silly clothing: Your life will be no different. Unfortunately there will be no Spanish Empire to bring a disease that will destroy the Communist Empire.</p>

		<p>I am a non-religious agnostic, who is a member of the Freedom from Religion Foundation.  So I do not believe in Christianity, or practice any other religion.</p>
<p>However, I still think it is wrong and unethical for Lord Justice Munby and Mr. Justice Beatson to ban Eunice and Owen Johns from from fostering children, on account of their being Christians.</p>
<p>If Great Britian really is the secular state these two Justices claim it is, then whatever the church the Johns&rsquo; go to, should not be held against them.</p>
<p>At the same time, our own United States of America, is meant by the First Amendment of our Constitution, to be a secular state.</p>
<p>A true secular state should not ban Mr. and Mrs. John from fostering children, on account of their religion.  Because a true secular state does not interfere in religious matters like the former Soviet Union, the England the Pilgrims fled from, or Saudi Arabia today.</p>
<p>These two Justices claim Great Britain is no longer a Christian nation.  During the Revolutionary War, many of the colonists who served in either colonial Loyalist regimments, or simply joined the British Army itself, were Christians who fought on the Loyalist side of the war.  These Christian Loyalists did so because they believed King George to be God&rsquo;s divinely appointed ruler, that independence for the American colonies was contrary to the will of God, and the spirit of &#8220;anti-Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a patriotic American, I do not want either the Christian Right, the Muslims, or any other religious fanatics to turn my country into any kind of theocracy.  </p>
<p>Discrimination because of what you do, or not believe in, is simply plain wrong.</p>

		<p>Christianity is also being infiltrated by the pagan/liberal element.</p>
<p>Christmas and Easter are NOT Christian holidays and never have been; these came about from pagan customs.  (No, I am not a JW or SDA or Worldwide Church of God member.)</p>
<p>Then you have the &#8220;liberal&#8221; Christians who think that telling gays that homosexuality is a sin is hate.  </p>
<p>Christianity is simply this:  Believing on Christ, that He died to take your sin away.  That&rsquo;s all, no more, no less.  It&rsquo;s not a religion (if you consider a religion to be basically rules and regulations).  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s being eradictated, infiltrated, maligned&hellip;I could go on.</p>

		<p>Anon #5: You miss the point. <i>Secular nation is a nation that has a time for its religion and another time for politics, both separate from one another.</i> Christians have a word that is the antonym of that.  Integrity.</p>
<p>The word religion comes from the Latin <i>religio</i>, to bind. It is the principles that bind one&rsquo;s life into a coherent whole. That&rsquo;s integrity. And that is why Christianity is inseparably bound up with the common law of England.  Because over the centuries, the values of Christianity have informed the political and legal processes of England.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is a lot more to raising children than not teaching them to go around slaughtering people.  Children relate to sexuality in a way that should be obvious to everybody. Furthermore, the children&rsquo;s own sexuality is only one of the challenges they will face, for which they rely for guidance on their parents&rsquo; example. You get my point?</p>

		<p>Ok, here&rsquo;s the thing. I think the article is a bit misleading. Who were they going to adopt or foster? British kids or, let&rsquo;s be honest, African or other kinds of refugee kids. Normally, I&rsquo;d have no problem with this couple unless they are using Christianity as a form of immigration loophole to bring even more people who are not British and probably do not belong in Britain. <br>
I know that some won&rsquo;t like me saying that, but let&rsquo;s be honest, won&rsquo;t the foster kids, if refugees or something, just be another group of people what hates white British and calls them racist for no reason other than wanting to be around their own people? </p>

		<p>The First Amendment makes the U.S. different from other Western nations.  The belief here in freedom of speech and freedom of religion is still strong, and no small group of anti-religion leftists is going to make a dent, regardless of their vast MSM forum.  Many Americans still attend religious services, and among blacks, Hispanics, and Southern whites, churches and church attendance abound.  The Supreme Court just ruled that a tiny fundamentalist Christian church could demonstrate in the general vicinity of funerals.  (The only reason the complaint reached any level of judicial scrutiny was almost certainly because the congregation held up signs declaring that homosexuals are Hell-bound.)  The only Justice who dissented the decision is a conservative Catholic who argued that the church&rsquo;s declarations are fighting words, a position that, to me, seems specious and pulled out of the air just as an excuse to go on record as opposing the Court&rsquo;s judgment.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;In the long run I think Christianity will come to accept these activities as being normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>As one of (if not the ONLY) cleric that writes here, I would say to this statement, as well as the news link that started off this post, that, if Christianity is to accomodate to the world, THEN IT CEASES TO BE Christianity. [Rom. 12:1,2]</p>
<p>Which is what the Gays, the Liberals, the jews, and all thsoe who have a long-standing animus against the Church of God, want us to do.</p>
<p>Well, just as racial awakening is now happening, so, too, is an awakening of virile, no ground ceded Christianity.  Fifty years of infiltration of all the mainline churches have rendered them useless- salt without savor, Our Lord would say. It is not to those churches that people should go, to be blunt. It is to those communions who say, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord,&#8221; and then ACT on that belief. </p>
<p>And, if those of us who are willing to stand for our Faith will eventually become martyrs, so be it. Orthodoxia ki thanatos, as they say. Orthodox belief, or Death.<br>
Anything else, in the arena of belief, is a sham. THAT&rsquo;s why so many European women are becoming Muslim, frankly. They are tired of the faith they helped effeminize, and the pastors that should have heeded St. Paul&rsquo;s words in the first place.</p>

		<p>Germaniac is correct, but: I think that America has been a socialist/fascist nation for quite awhile if you look at the criteria for communist/socialist/fascist such as a progressive income tax, government controlled schools, and government control of industry. Observe how the US industries have to &#8220;get permission&#8221; from the government to operate. Just last night the &#8220;news&#8221; noted that the Executive Branch had issued only one permission slip to drill in the gulf since the BP disaster. Our vehicles have essentially been designed by Washington for a long time, and our toilets have been designed by the EPA. Is that free enterprise?????</p>

		<p>Christianity isn&rsquo;t being &#8220;eradicated,&#8221; it&rsquo;s committing suicide.  Today&rsquo;s Christians (and I use the word loosely) gain status among each other by ostentatiously &#8220;forgiving&#8221; those who hate, abuse or even kill them.  They seem to think that it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s will that they should &#8220;welcome the stranger,&#8221; even when the stranger means sure death to its host society  &mdash;  and to Christianity itself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid that what passes for Christianity these days is little more than watered-down New-Ageism, mixed with feel-good Political Correctness.  And <i>still</i> leftists can&rsquo;t stop gleefully dancing on Christianity&rsquo;s beaten corpse.<br>

		<p>Reply to Germaniac:</p>
<p>It would make more sense for a billionaire like Donald Trump, Warren Buffet, or Bill Gates to become a card-carrying member of the Communist Party, than it would be for a blue-collar working class person.</p>
<p>Communism pretends to be for the working class, but it&rsquo;s real purpose is to establish iron-clad dictatorship of the rich and powerful ruling elite.</p>
<p>In other words, communism is a system that pretends to be Robin Hood, when it is really the Sheriff of Nottingham in disguise!</p>
<p>The leftist activists who are active members of the many communist and socialist parties, do not know that they are acting on behalf of what the establishment they despise, actually wants them to do.  But don&rsquo;t try to tell them the facts, because most, if not all, leftists would never believe you!</p>

		<p>A basic to this discussion is simply how much of what outside<br>
observers see as &#8220;Christianity&#8221; is, in fact, rooted and genuine.<br>
Loss of size, as every dietary consultant to family physicians<br>
knows, is not necessarily a sign of lost vigor.  At root, Christianity is not sanguine or &#8220;misty&#8221; about those who live<br>
outside its Grace and commitment.  Nor should it be.  The war<br>
against Christendom is a war against every group cohension except that enjoyed by most of those who pursue the dissolution<br>
of the &#8220;us/them&#8221; sense among all others except themselves.   </p>

<p>&#8220;I am a gay agnostic, yet I understand the cultural significance of Christianity and its importance to my ancestors. I find this constant need to cleanse society of any Christian remnants is very similar to the need to wipe paganism out of Europe.<br>
Could you imagine Europe without cathedrals? Without saints? Without the unification, which Christianity brought? Without Christmas, Easter, etc?&#8221;</p>
<p>I always find the ignorance of European history amazing among posters here on Amren (but not only).  It was a foreign invader, Christianity that felt the &#8220;urge&#8221; to wipe out paganism in Europe (and everywhere in the world), and they did it with &#8220;fire, dungeon, and sword,&#8221; to put it poetically, and in just one of the many titles of books on the subject.  Cathedrals were built with what are called &#8220;Gothic Arches,&#8221; which is nothing but an architectural term today.  Those Gothic Arches were built that way to resemble the high, curved angle that oak tree groves formed, and were European pagans held their rituals.  They held the oak to be sacred, and connected to the gods by lightning.  But the Christians tore down those sacred groves.  In the most famous case, St. Boniface cut down a sacred oak in Germany, and dared its God to harm him.  Part of the purpose of the cathedral was to both invite with familiar forms and intimidate the simple populations. Arrests, tortures, and horrible executions waited for those who dared to think just a little for themselves, or hold to the old ways, in any form.</p>
<p>Europe was not unified by Christianity at any time, really.  Dominated, yes, but not unified.  The first thousand years saw much bloody conquest of Europe by Christians. &#8220;Where reason fails, the sword must prevail.&#8221;  One good example; After the Swedes became Christianized, they invaded Finland.  After vanquishing their neighbors, they threw the survivors, armor and all, into a nearby lake, for the purpose of mass baptism.  Obviously, many did not survive being &#8220;saved.&#8221;  In the 13th century, we had the famous Albigensian Crusade in Southern France against a small set of &#8220;heretics&#8221; called &#8220;good men&#8221; by the population.  They sinned in denying that anyone needed a central church for salvation.  When Simon de Monfort, the leader of the crusade asked how to best know heretic from Christian, the Pope replied, &#8220;Kill them all.  God will know his own.&#8221;  This crusade saw the establishment of the Dominican Order.  They were the expert torturers who purged all of Europe for centuries.  A book on their reign of terror in Europe can be found called, &#8220;The Holy Terror.&#8221; </p>
<p>Early on, the aristocracies in Europe found political alliance with Christian Rome simply a repeat of old alliances formed during the pre-Christian period.  In this way, monarchy and church worked together to dominate the land and people, many of whom were serfs and peasants, peasants being free, and serfs, slaves.  This amazing suppression was sometimes resisted;  The Peasant Revolt of 1380 is worth a study for those wishing to learn something of actual history for the average person in medieval Europe.  These conditions are the main reason that our Founding Fathers insisted on the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>With relentless force and the murder of thousands, Christianity became the main power in Europe, but warring over its particulars never ended.  The embers of those wars may be seen in Northern Ireland.  Many English and Irish are completely distracted from the real invasion of their nations by non-whites by a deep hatred of one another, deeply ingrained by this Christian argument.  Today, we see Popes that attempt to appear benevolent, but represent every backwards, self-interested motivation form of policy imaginable.  The remnant of corruption in the Catholic Church is seen in the rampant problems of pedophilia.  Those monumental Cathedrals, monasteries, and convents in Europe have walls filled with the skeletons of aborted and newborn babies.  Homosexuals have long found a haven in the monastery.  The Protestant sects are peopled by various groups from nationalists, to socialist fronts for asylum seekers, funded by taxpayer money, but paying none themselves.</p>
<p>I have visited more Cathedrals in Europe than anything else.  They are museums to the past.  But that past is fairly well understood by today&rsquo;s European, which is why so few are very strong Christians, especially in the old sense.  That many Europeans are beginning to realize their right to be European is encouraging, but the reinfection, assertion of Christianity into this new awakening, would be a huge mistake and only foment a future too like the past.  Islam only wishes to repeat in Europe what Christianity did first.  So far, Islam is doing this far less violently than Christianity did.</p>

		<p>Alot of people calling themselves White Nationalists join our enemies in attacking Christianity as a poison that is destroying Western Civilization.  It&rsquo;s an argument that doesn&rsquo;t hold water when you analyze that our civilization was at its strongest and healthiest peak when the vasty majority of people belonged to the church. You can see the effects of a diminishing faith in the ever increasing &#8220;rights&#8221; of homosexuals and feminazis and the moral bankruptcy that is rotting our society from the inside.  I&rsquo;m not saying there aren&rsquo;t some legitimate criticisms of the church but just as our educational system was take over by marxists so have many churches. I&rsquo;ve been to several denominations of churches and I know many of the mainline Protestant churches are pushing the homosexual and feminist agendas.  Some churches are so spiritually dead the clergy spend all their time in the pulpit talking about a piece of real estate the church should buy and even include a sermon that revolves around it.  Some of them use a term such as social justice to thinly disguise their promotion of class warfare.  These things aren&rsquo;t true Christianity and thankfully these churches are slowing dying off.   </p>

<p>As one of (if not the ONLY) cleric that writes here, I would say to this statement, as well as the news link that started off this post, that, if Christianity is to accomodate to the world, THEN IT CEASES TO BE Christianity. [Rom. 12:1,2]</p>
<p>Which is what the Gays, the Liberals, the jews, and all thsoe who have a long-standing animus against the Church of God, want us to do.</p>
<p>Well, just as racial awakening is now happening, so, too, is an awakening of virile, no ground ceded Christianity. Fifty years of infiltration of all the mainline churches have rendered them useless- salt without savor, Our Lord would say. It is not to those churches that people should go, to be blunt. It is to those communions who say, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord,&rdquo; and then ACT on that belief.</p>
<p>And, if those of us who are willing to stand for our Faith will eventually become martyrs, so be it. Orthodoxia ki thanatos, as they say. Orthodox belief, or Death.<br>
Anything else, in the arena of belief, is a sham. THAT&rsquo;s why so many European women are becoming Muslim, frankly. They are tired of the faith they helped effeminize, and the pastors that should have heeded St. Paul&rsquo;s words in the first place.<br>

<p>So true, poster!  The Christian Churches of today has NOTHING in common with true Christianity. That is why I quit going to these mainstream churches a long time ago. They teach nothing except the &#8220;feel good&#8221; message and &#8220;love everybody&#8221; nonsense that the Bible spoke out AGAINST! I go online and read and listen to the few pastors that do preach the ways of the Bible and to our race.  Christianity has become nothing but a watered down religion to accomodate the world and the multiracialists, who want to destroy the White race for a REASON.</p>

<p>I have heard this particular theory that if the Nazis were not extremist anti-semites, accepted German Jews as Germans and encouraged German Jews to join them, then Adolph Hitler would have had Albert Einstein on his staff.</p>
<p>As WW2 was coming to a close, the fading Third Reich was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons.  Therefore, according to this theory, were it not for the Nazis&rsquo; eliminationist anti-semitism, with Einstein on Hitler&rsquo;s staff, Germany would have been able to win WW2.  In other words, with Dr. Albert Einstein, Germany would have had the means to develop the atom bomb in time to win WW2.</p>
<p>I would be very interested to read commments from eveyone reading this post, about this particular theory I have mentioned.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your attention to this theory, everybody.</p>

		<p>Britain has had an infatuation with Totalitarianism for a very long time. George Orwell wrote of it and purposely placed his nightmare society in an English setting. He knew only too well what is repressed in the popular mind:  Elizabeth 1st, the Queen under whom England experienced its Shakespearean glory was a tyrant and the society she ruled was a police state. In fact, well-crafted Tyranny, not Liberty, is England&rsquo;s prime political contribution. Were it not for French excess during the Terror, no one would hold England up as some sort of &#8220;sunlit upland&#8221; as Churchill the Bloody would rhapsodize about.<br>

		<p>Anon #5: You miss the point. Secular nation is a nation that has a time for its religion and another time for politics, both separate from one another. Christians have a word that is the antonym of that. Integrity.<br>
The word religion comes from the Latin religio, to bind. It is the principles that bind one&rsquo;s life into a coherent whole. That&rsquo;s integrity. And that is why Christianity is inseparably bound up with the common law of England. Because over the centuries, the values of Christianity have informed the political and legal processes of England.<br>
Similarly, there is a lot more to raising children than not teaching them to go around slaughtering people. Children relate to sexuality in a way that should be obvious to everybody. Furthermore, the children&rsquo;s own sexuality is only one of the challenges they will face, for which they rely for guidance on their parents&rsquo; example. You get my point<br>

I&rsquo;m aware of the significance Christianity has had on civic life and laws, however, to be fair to non-Christians you cannot enforce Christian beliefs upon others. As I have said before, I appreciate and respect the role Christianity has played in our history, but I am not Christian and I oppose any form of theocracy. <br>
Of course, I was making a point. However, I&rsquo;m not sure what you are getting at, could you explain further? I ask because I don&rsquo;t want to assume. <br>

Though I find your first statement insulting, your post is very interesting.<br>
You assume I am not aware of European history when I am aware of everything you have just posted (except for the fact about gothic arches). I am aware that Christianity is a Semitic religion, but I am also aware that it has been part of western civilization for centuries upon centuries. <br>
Christianity did invade and dominate (at the cost of our ancestors), but I believe it became part of Western culture. That&rsquo;s my two cents. An interesting post nonetheless.<br>

<p>I have to disagree.<br>
I think nation&rsquo;s are healthiest when they have a strong cultural and ethnic identity, but religious devotion? Some of the greatest ages of our ancestors were times when they moved farther from religion, not closer. The renaissance, enlightenment, etc were all golden ages of discovery and advancement. <br>
I believe that social extremists are an issue, but let&rsquo;s not throw the baby out with the bath water. In these times of crisis, let us not throw our rationality away; after all, it is what has made Western civilization so great.<br>
