<h1>Quebec Intellectuals Promote Wave of &#8216;Interculturalism&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Canadian Press, March 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Amid increasingly strident criticisms of multiculturalism, both in Canada and abroad, a group of Quebec intellectuals is proposing an alternative that could save an idea that has become part of the national fabric.</p>
<p>Interculturalism is being branded as a new model for integration and a solution to some of the anti-immigrant backlash that has accompanied the debate in Quebec over the accommodation of minorities.</p>
<p>Interculturalism takes for granted the centrality of francophone culture. From there it works to integrate other minorities into a common public culture, all while respecting their diversity.</p>
<p>Its backers say it can also help multiculturalism weather some of the attacks it has suffered recently.</p>
<p>Those attacks have been most acute in Quebec, where a member of the Opposition Parti Quebecois bluntly declared last month that &#8220;multiculturalism is not a Quebec value.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even a scion of the family most closely associated with multiculturalism in Canada acknowledges interculturalism can make certain ideas about diversity more palatable in Quebec.</p>
<p>&#8220;The word multiculturalism has become synonymous in the mind of many Quebecers as being something that is imposed by English Canada,&#8221; said Liberal MP Justin Trudeau, whose father  &mdash;  former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau  &mdash;  made multiculturalism official government policy in 1971.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me (interculturalism) is more of a word we chose to use in Quebec that is acceptable when multiculturalism is beginning to be less so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trudeau&rsquo;s somewhat ambivalent endorsement speaks to the central problem interculturalism has faced so far: is it any different from multiculturalism?</p>
<p>Interculturalism&rsquo;s leading champion in Quebec argues the two are separate concepts, though he admits they also have some overlap.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism&rsquo;s founding assumption is that there is no dominant culture in Canada, says Gerard Bouchard, a sociologist best known to Quebecers for co-chairing a government commission into the accommodation of minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a non-starter in Quebec because everybody knows there is a majority culture in Quebec,&#8221; he said. &#8220;it is the francophone culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any model to manage diversity in Quebec must take into account this major fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a model, says Bouchard, that can deliver a certain cohesion to a society that feels its identity is perpetually under threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to protect, to shield ourselves from anything that looks like fragmentation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Interculturalism is itself not a new idea. It was bandied about unofficially by Quebec bureaucrats in the 1980s and began appearing in some official documents a decade later.</p>
<p>But in Bouchard it has found a passionate advocate. The brother of former premier Lucien Bouchard, he is perhaps the closest thing Quebec has to an academic celebrity.</p>
<p>Bouchard first argued for interculturalism in the reasonable accommodation commission&rsquo;s final report, which he co-wrote with philosopher Charles Taylor in 2008.</p>
<p>But most of the report&rsquo;s recommendations were ignored by Premier Jean Charest&rsquo;s government.</p>
<p>Concerned that Quebec is still floundering through this high-stakes debate, Bouchard has taken up the charge once again.</p>
<p>An interculturalism manifesto appeared in Quebec newspapers last week penned by Bouchard and other leading Quebec academics.</p>
<p>Bouchard has also been making the rounds of television talk shows. An international symposium on the topic will be held in Montreal in May.</p>
<p>The renewed interest in interculturalism comes at a time when multiculturalism is on the defensive.</p>
<p>Last month, conservative French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared the policy had failed, saying newcomers should &#8220;accept to melt in a single community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar comments have been made by his right-wing counterparts in the European Union, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>In English Canada, multiculturalism has also faced repeated attacks from the right, where it is often equated with moral relativism or, worse, a creation of the federal Liberals aimed at securing the ethnic vote.</p>
<p>In Quebec, it is seen as a way of limiting the political influence of the country&rsquo;s francophones and has never been officially endorsed by the provincial government, in either its federalist or sovereigntist incarnations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know very well why it was put in place,&#8221; the PQ&rsquo;s Louise Beaudoin said during a recent debate in the provincial legislature.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was to dilute the fact, the concept, even the idea of two founding peoples in the .^&Nbsp;.&nbsp;. very foundation of Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multiculturalism&rsquo;s supporters make no quarter for such arguments.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&rsquo;s wrong,&#8221; Trudeau said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m sorry to see so much of the sovereigntist argument predicated on the fear of the English, fear of how vulnerable Quebec was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He adds that the feeling of insecurity felt by many sovereigntists is why they have &#8220;always wanted to build up walls and keep others out.&#8221;</p>
<p>But whereas Trudeau maintains this sense of insecurity is unnecessary, Bouchard says it simply comes with French being a minority language in North America.</p>
<p>It is interculturalism&rsquo;s ability to address that anxiety that Bouchard counts as its key advantage over multiculturalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any model that seeks to manage Quebec&rsquo;s ethno-cultural diversity effectively must take into account the existence of an ethno-cultural majority and the uncertainty that is associated with its future,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Bouchard does not count himself among those who believe multiculturalism has failed in the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes sense on the anglophone side of the country,&#8221; he says, pointing out that less than 30 per cent of Canada&rsquo;s population is of British origin.</p>
<p>But he adds that Canadian multiculturalism is far from a static concept, and has adapted to the criticism that it contributes to the fragmentation of the national identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the last few years it has been changing in a very interesting way,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It is getting closer to interculturalism.&#8221;<br>
