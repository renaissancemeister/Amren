			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Matt Hinton, Feb. 28, 2011, Yahoo! Sports</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Alongside the many absurd feats of size, strength and speed on display at the NFL&rsquo;s combine for incoming draft picks, there are also the annual efforts to bore as deeply as possible into the players&rsquo; skulls. Is this guy smart? Is he a flake? Is he a potential &#8220;cancer&#8221; in the locker room? Is he really committed to sacrificing his body to the sport? The informal method of sniffing out a potential head case involves face-to-face interviews and the sort of ephemeral buzz that dogged this year&rsquo;s resident &#8220;character risk,&#8221; Arkansas quarterback Ryan Mallett, throughout the weekend in Indianapolis. The formal method is the Wonderlic test.</p>
<p>Usually, leaked Wonderlic scores are embarrassingly low. Not so, however, for Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy, who nearly aced the test, scoring a 48 out of a possible 50 according to his hometown Fort Worth Star-Telegram. That score puts him on the high, high end of potential employees in any field, and especially among NFL quarterbacks. A 48 is twice the league average for incoming QBs, and matches the highest score for a quarterback on record, belonging to current Buffalo Bills starter Ryan Fitzpatrick, a Harvard grad. (Here is the most complete database of Wonderlic scores by quarterbacks through 2006. Only one other starter last year, the 49ers&rsquo; Alex Smith, managed a 40 on the test; only one NFL player, former Bengals punter Pat McInally  &mdash;  another Harvard grad  &mdash;  is believed to have scored a perfect 50.)</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, coming as it does as part of the process of poking, prodding, dissecting and otherwise maximizing every conceivable flaw of incoming prospects, McElroy&rsquo;s brainpower still has the potential to be taken as a negative around the league, as explained by Pro Football Talk&rsquo;s Mike Florio:</p>
<blockquote>That said, scoring too high can be as much of a problem as scoring too low. Football coaches want to command the locker room. Being smarter than the individual players makes that easier. Having a guy in the locker room who may be smarter than every member of the coaching staff can be viewed as a problem  &mdash;  or at a minimum as a threat to the egos of the men who hope to be able when necessary to outsmart the players, especially when trying in some way to manipulate them.
<p>So while McElroy, who was unable to work out due to injury, may be really smart, he perhaps would have been wise to tank a few of the answers.</blockquote></p>

		<p>Judging from his comment I can&rsquo;t imagine Mike Florio is a Wonderlic ace.</p>
<p>It must escape him that nearly every brilliant manipulative football coach was once a &#8220;dumb&#8221; manipulated football player.</p>
<p>Is that what he thinks coaching comes down to? </p>
<p>On another note, if Greg McElroy is smart because of his Wonderlic score, what does that say about Vince Young?</p>
<p>Just that he&rsquo;s a victim of &#8220;cultural bias.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The truth is McElroy may or may not succeed as an NFL quarterback. However, he will succeed at anything else he does. He played his senior year as a graduate student completing an MBA. He finished his undergraduate degree during his junior year. </p>
<p>He also narrowly missed receiving a Rhodes Scholarship and almost certainly would have gone to England next year instead of playing in the NFL.</p>
<p>We Tide fans (and there are millions of us) are extremely proud of Greg. Well done young man, well done indeed! </p>

		<p>This can not be true, somebody from Alabama that is 50% smarter than all the nfl players and coaches. We have always been told by the media that we are nothing but ignorant red neck hillbillies and racist on top of that and the only good thing that comes out of Tuscaloosa is the Mercedes m class.</p>

Since the NFL is largely black, it&rsquo;s not a good place to be too smart. You don&rsquo;t want to make your teammates feel inadequate because of their innate cognitive deficiencies. You may damage their fragile self-esteem and set them up as failures in life.</p>
<p>I have found that when I&rsquo;m around blacks (at work), it&rsquo;s always best to keep things simple. Most of them are controlled by their feelings (which can be on a hair trigger) more than their intellect. Don&rsquo;t show them up, it ticks them off. Just nod and agree with what they say.</p>

		<p>There are cheat sheets being pased around which, if studied, can give a mediocre person a higher than average grade.  They consist of probable questions on the Wonderlic.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this quarterback did anything untoward, but there are incidents galore where others have.</p>
<p>If a guy gets a high score on the Wonderlic, but was only a mediocre or less student, chances are he took advantage of some advantages that were available.</p>
<p>There has even been reports of stolen tests offered for sale.</p>

		<p>Note that all four individuals mentioned in this article as getting high Wonderlic scores are white.  Will the DOJ investigate the firm that writes the test for disparate impact?</p>
<p>As for Mr. McElroy, I think the big hangup that NFL coaches have with those with high Wonderlic scores is that NFL coaches are an insecure lot   &mdash;   They&rsquo;re obviously smarter than most of the players they coach, but they&rsquo;re also not as smart as they&rsquo;d like you to think they are, and their job isn&rsquo;t the complicated cerebral science that they&rsquo;d like you to think it is.  On top of that, they&rsquo;re the kind of people who fall sucker to ephemeral fads of offense or defensive strategy (usually offensive), a la teenage girls and Justin Bieber.  They don&rsquo;t like smart players because they fear the smart player could gradually become an alternate de facto coach.  Especially if the smart player is a QB, and QBs obviously have a leadership responsibility   &mdash;   Some even are their teams&rsquo; de facto offensive coordinators.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m lost here. Not being a football fan (or a sports fan, either, for that matter), I have no idea what the Wonderlic is (nor does my spell-checker, apparently). Also, as important as intelligence is in most fields, I don&rsquo;t see why it should be so important in football. Surely brawn and, well, just a talent for football are what really matters? Also, by gushing about how smart this white player is, isn&rsquo;t the writer and others involved in danger of being tarred as &#8220;racist&#8221; for implying that  the black players are not so smart?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some of the rumored Wonderlic questions, and they&rsquo;re not excessively difficult.  In fact, there&rsquo;s really no point in stealing a Wonderlic test, because preparation really doesn&rsquo;t help you get a higher score.  The secret of the Wonderlic is speed   &mdash;   You get 50 questions in 14 (?) minutes.  The point of the Wonderlic is to measure your thinking ability under pressure.</p>

		<p>Although this is my first time being informed of the existence of the &#8220;Wonderlic&#8221; test due to my aversion to mainstream sports, I have researched the scoring system and have calculated that a score of 48 on the test should correspond with an IQ of 156. I find it difficult to believe that a meathead could possibly score so high, and I question the test&rsquo;s relatedness to IQ. Part of it is definitely academic in nature as opposed to the purely logical composition of most IQ tests, and its correlation with IQ should therefore be only slightly greater than that of the ACT and SAT, neither of which are acceptable as entrance scores to most high-IQ societies. </p>
<p>Is his IQ well above average? Definitely. Is it so ridiculously high as a 156? I strongly doubt it. </p>

		<p>I was curious aboout this Wonderlic test and checked out a sample test. I don&rsquo;t consider myself all that smart, but this test looks pretty easy. Below is a few questions,</p>
<p>Paper sells for 21 cents per pad. What will 5 pads cost? </p>
<p>When rope is selling at $.10 a foot, how many feet can you buy for sixty cents? </p>
<p>A boy is 16 years old and his sister is twice as old. When the boy is 22 years old, what will be the age of his sister? </p>

		<p>For those who are wondering, a rough conversion for Wonderlic to IQ is IQ = 2WPT + 60. So a score of 48 would convert to an IQ of approximately 156. That&rsquo;s a very nice score.</p>

		<p>I agree with Ken comment #3 wholeheartedly.On the subject of intelligence and football:Any coach would want a quarterback who is much smarter than the defensive backfield.The best attribute is being able to make split-second decisions,making himself a constant threat.Usually,the men who have strong FATHERLY leadership at a young age are the best at leadership and decisionmaking,and anyone who says he is a threat to the staff or the egos of players is just pandering to the cerebally-challenged blacks.Most players want to win the SuperBowl.G0 Greg McElroy!</p>

		<p>This man is a stellar example of the student athlete, thereby becoming anathema to sports writers and talking heads on sports panels.</p>
<p>Just last night on espn it was mentioned how poorly cam newton did on his wonderlic so without hesitation one talking head began to villify those doing well, and demeaning the high scores.</p>
<p>Do I need to say that talking head was black?  Only blacks (and their politican suckoffs), salute ignorance and overall lack of knowledge.</p>

		<p>In Ancient Greece the ideal of arete (&#8216;excellence&rsquo;) was a major cultural tenent. On one hand Greek Athletes generally embodied an ideal of humanity in their physical abilities and discipline. On the other hand we have Imperial Rome and it&rsquo;s circuses and gladiatorial games in which the &#8216;players&rsquo; were looked upon as little better than beasts.</p>
<p>The latter is prevalent in American culture, most pro athletes come to the major leagues through the filter of college sports, in which &#8216;players&rsquo; are selected based upon how well they serve a team as beasts of burden. No longer are the best athletes selected based upon what their excellence is (a prime example is the ill-disciplined behavior and shoddy physical fitness of paid athletes.) This is in fact contrary to the role these sports served when teams were originally formed.</p>
<p>I wrote an article on this paradigm shift here: <a href="http://www.examiner.com/classical-antiquity-in-pittsburgh/pitt-football-rape-and-violence" rel="nofollow">http://www.examiner.com/classical-antiquity-in-pittsburgh/pitt-football-rape-and-violence</a></p>
<p>Athletes like McElroy are somewhat frightening to people used to the status quo of the last 50 years: idiot athletes who entertain us with their antics and blood. The trend can even be seen in MMA and boxing with people like Chuck Lidell (holds an accounting degree) or Mirko &#8216;Cro Cop&rsquo; (anti-terrorist police officer) or the Klitschko brothers who are well-educated and can hold political office.</p>
<p>We are seeing the tide turn from mindless bread and circuses to people we can actually admire and emulate for more than brutish strength.</p>

<p>That is pretty close to probably accuracy.  Vince Young&rsquo;s initial 6 is pretty close to accurate I&rsquo;d say. That would give him around a 72 IQ which is pretty close to what you would expect from someone who is functionally illiterate (as was evidenced by his nearly incoherent message to his teammates that he wrote when he joined the Titans), has trouble even verbalizing his thoughts and is prone to episodes of antisocial behavior. There were rumors when he got an adjusted 15 that it was because he was given the same exact test and was allowed to complete it in a less stressful environment, which would for all intensive purposes completely nullify the purpose of the test, which is to judge mentally cognition under stress. </p>

<p>You are right about the way the media portrays Alabama and Tuscaloosa. The Mercedes Benz M Class is not the only thing that comes out of here. We have plants that make Michelin Tires, rolled steel, refined petroleum products, Spandex, chemicals, and much, much more. Our mines export millions of tones of some of the world&rsquo;s finest metallurgical coal. The next time you use your GPS system, think of Tuscaloosa. The atomic clocks that synchronize the GPS satellites and set the national time standard are made here. For the first time Mercedes will begin production of the C Class outside of Germany, and they will be made in Tuscaloosa.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, by the way, to give you an idea of the Alabama fan base. Our stadium seats 102,000. On an average game day Saturday, about 150,000 outsiders come into town. Many don&rsquo;t have tickets, so they just come to tailgate and party. The operator of one of our camper parking lots stated that they had vehicles registered from 31 states. And that is one of the smaller lots.</p>

<p>Funny you said that.  When I got in this evening, and turned my idiot box on, it was on the CBS Evening News.  Therefore, I doubled Katie Couric&rsquo;s ratings.  (Cha ching.)  Anyway, at the time I turned it on, she was starting in on a joint CBS/Sports Illustrated report about college football players with rap sheets.  The study found that Pitt has the most players with &#8216;sheets.  Texas Christian University (TCU) had none, and they showed a faded out picture of TCU celebrating its Rose Bowl win from January.  I&rsquo;ll be darned   &mdash;   all of the players in the picture were white.  (I do know TCU&rsquo;s team had some blacks).  Coincidence, not.</p>
<p>Part of the interview featured that Lapcheck character from that Diversity in Sports institute in Florida.  The irony of that is delicious, because it&rsquo;s his demands for more &#8220;diversity&#8221; (read: blacks) in sports that&rsquo;s leading to more and more people with rap sheets on the roster. </p>
<p>The first athlete featured was a Polynesian-American defensive player from Utah.  The new fad in football is to get all these Samoans and Tongans.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve taken a sample Wonderlic and agree that they&rsquo;re not difficult  &mdash;    &mdash;  I missed two out of twenty in five minutes time  &mdash;    &mdash;   and, yes, they do test for speed in answering, but if the basic knowledge isn&rsquo;t there speed will do no good, so preparation has got to be important.  Taking tests that are designed similarly offer a bit of practise, especially if a person hasn&rsquo;t taken a Wonderlic type of test before.   <br>
 <br>
Too, there are only so many Wonderlics.  By that I mean these tests are bandied around from one group to another over a period of time and the liklihood of the same tests being taken by several NFL teams is a possibility, which means that if a black player who is pitifully inadequate in math and in solving abstract or spatial problems and he gets a high score, you can bet he&rsquo;s had a copy of the test before in his posession.</p>
<p>Some of the best scam artists at duping the system are blacks.  In my experience they&rsquo;ve honed the practise to a fine art.  It seems to come natural to some of them.<br>

<p>I disagree.  The purpose of the Wonderlic is not narrowly focused to determine mental speed, although that is one of it&rsquo;s aims.  It is a test that is designed to determine problem solving abilities, but if the person being tested has never grasped the fundementals of education, like fractions, percentages and ratios, to say nothing of reading comprehension, he/she is not going to get a score much greater than what would be considered mental retardation and/or illiteracy no matter how fast his/her brain might be working.</p>
<p>So, you&rsquo;re not accurate either when you declare prepatory work won&rsquo;t help.  Preparation assists even the best and brightest on every test available in recent times, even I.Q. tests to some extent.</p>
