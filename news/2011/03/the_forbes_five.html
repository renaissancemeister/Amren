<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Shawn &#8220;Jay-Z&#8221; Carter has had quite a career thus far. Since debuting in 1996 with hip-hop classic Reasonable Doubt, he has sold over 50 million records worldwide. He&rsquo;s parlayed his musical success into lucrative businesses in the realms of fashion, cuisine and advertising (for more, check out my new Jay-Z book, which hits stores next week). Last year he earned $63 million, tops among hip-hop artists for the third time in four years.</p>
<p>But when it comes to net worth, Jay-Z is number two. The top spot goes to Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs, who tops our accounting of rap&rsquo;s richest with a fortune of $475 million, fueled by his interests in Sean John clothing, Bad Boy Worldwide record label and, most significantly, his Diageo joint-venture vodka brand Ciroc. Jay-Z ranks a close second, with $450 million.</p>
<p>Superproducer/rapper Dr. Dre ranks third with $125 million, fueled by past earnings generated from his own career and by helping to launch those of Snoop Dogg and Eminem. Curtis &#8220;50 Cent&#8221; Jackson, a onetime Dr. Dre protege who reaped a nine-figure payday from the sale of Vitamin Water to Coca-Cola, rounds out the top five in a tie with Cash Money Records cofounder Bryan &#8220;Birdman&#8221; Williams at $100 million.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the dirty little secret behind most of these hip hop fortunes:  The seed money (*) came from dealing illegal drugs.  Jay-Z even admits it publicly, and he narrowly avoided long prison stints on several occasions:</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/46m2f4n</p>
<p>Question:  Since they admit, either loudly or quietly, that their fortunes should have never been made because the foundation was illegal drug dealing, where are all the asset forfeiture loudmouths wanting to take away these rap moguls&rsquo; and artists&rsquo; hundreds of millions?</p>
<p>*   &mdash;   For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar, you need to raise a nice little chunk of money in order to begin a serious career as a major label artist.  Mainly for the physical plant (instruments, electronics), personnel (background chorus musicians, dancers if applicable, instrument players, business managers, etc), and most expensive of all, studio time to record your first (and all your) recordings intended for commercial release and sales.  If you don&rsquo;t have some sort of sugar daddy, you&rsquo;ve got to earn the money somehow.  For most of these rap fortunes, that &#8220;seed money&#8221; came from drug dealing.  And once those rappers got rich, they &#8220;seeded&#8221; newer rappers.  But sans the drug dealing, neither the existing rappers nor their proteges would have amounted to anything.</p>

		<p>I wonder how much of their fortunes do they donate to charitys? How much do they put back into their communities or help the needy in their &#8220;hoods&#8221;. My guess would be close to zero.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll admit that as a teenager in the 90s I did listen to rap, for basically the same reason that Jared Taylor said most people accept the prevailing orthodoxy of their time: moral inertia. It wasn&rsquo;t until my time in the Army when I was constantly surrounded by blacks that I began to crave ANYTHING besides rap when I listened to music. I had to endure black pathology day-in and day out, so music became a soothing escape from them.</p>
<p>The fact is that whites have much in-house cleaning to do on this subject. The majority of purchasers and downloaders of rap are white. Proportionately this might not be the case, but the raw numbers highlight a problem. Daily I see young white males with backwards hats riding in their parents&rsquo; cars listening to this stuff, fantasizing that they are hyper-masculine black thugs, and I truly wish that they would drink from a deeper and better well. But what is the solution?</p>
<p>If their parents forbid them from listening to this stuff, they make it more appealing, and buying a rap album becomes an act of rebellion. If they leave the kids to make their own choices, rap prevails in sporting arenas, in movies, in pretty much all dominant culture outside of Nascar (a Jay-Z song was featured at the beginning of the new &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221; movie to show how pervasive this has become).</p>

		<p>I was just reading yesterday how 50 Cent, Beyonce (Mrs. Jay-Z), Usher, Mariah Carey and Nelly Furtado, due to recent events have all donated their pay checks from playing for Moammar Gaddafi&rsquo;s people to charity.<br/>
<a href="http://goo.gl/Qy88X" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/Qy88X</a> </p>
<p>Last year, human rights campaigner and environmental activist Sting (who&rsquo;s worth about $400 million) was caught doing a private show for Uzbek dictator President Islam Karimov&rsquo;s daughter for multimillion dollar payout.<br/>
<a href="http://goo.gl/uK6mb" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/uK6mb</a> <br/>

Also last year we had Naomi Campbell getting caught receiving &#8216;blood diamonds&rsquo; from Liberian dictator Charles Taylor. <br/>
<a href="http://goo.gl/DNJn" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/DNJn</a></p>
<p>Then only last week Sean Penn was meeting up again with his good buddy, socialist dictator Hugo Chavez. Who has also privately received other Hollywood comrades such as Danny Glover and Kevin Spacey. <br/>
<a href="http://goo.gl/QKBpP" rel="nofollow">http://goo.gl/QKBpP</a> </p>
<p>Of course we also have Bono of U2, throwing his support out to Jacob Zuma of the communist ANC and the &#8220;kill the Boer&rsquo; song.<br/>

		<p>Nobody ever said junk does not sell in America.</p>
<p>All anyone has to do is listen to a few minutes of any of the faux artists recordings to realize what they are hearing is beyond perverted.</p>
<p>Filthy talk and descriptions of women, offensive remarks about law enforcement, putting drugging and thugging as behaviours to be admired.</p>
<p>I was a Big Elvis Fan but I can remember Southern Preachers saying he would swing the doors wide open for blacks and the destruction could never be healed. I laughed but looking back I was a fool.</p>
<p>Eventually someone would have done it but it is pretty easy to see the downhill slide of music since the late 50&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>What these blacks are selling is not music or entertainment it is a pathway to the road to destruction and failure.</p>

		<p>    My first brush with Rap was probably in the early eighties . I was working a downtown route and a car stopped at a traffic light was booming and chanting . The bridge on the song (if you can call it a song) sounded just like the theme song from &#8220;Gilligan&rsquo;s Island.&#8221; I laughed and said, &#8220;this will never go over.&#8221; Boy, was I wrong . Wish now I had beat Vanilla Ice to the punch . The extra pocket change would be nice, real nice . I am astounded there are those willing to pay good money for such tripe .</p>

Blacks used to complain that alcohol firms targeted black communities with billboards which was why blacks communities had problems with alcohol.</p>
<p>Black rappers are now paid to include brand name liquors in their raps. Black rappers are now the ones selling out their own communities for a buck and no one complains.</p>

		<p>I listen to rap music often, I enjoy it. I don&rsquo;t see a problem with that. Music is one of the only things blacks can excel at because it does not need the two intellectual powers the black brain was never required to evolve: impulse control and strategic thinking. If you look at the richest blacks they are nearly all in sports, entertainment and music. Those are the only places they can thrive, and perhaps even exceed whites and asians, because it requires short term reactive thinking only.</p>

Rock music is a factor in virtually every crime imaginable.<br/>
Rock stars admit that its main theme is to get people involved in sex and drugs and acts of violence.</p>
<p>Rock is so pervasive that even country music and kid&rsquo;s music have incorporated rock music into their names.</p>
<p>Although most young people will listen to some type of rock music to get by, Americans have to acknowledge that rocks message is to blasphemy American values.</p>
<p>Rap like every modern genre of music falls under the category of rock n&rsquo; roll.</p>
<p>Although knowledge is power when educating ourselves about rock music, fighting it with an eye for an eye approach is moral since the desructiveness of rock and roll is a daily experience.</p>
<p>One documentary entitled: They Sold their Souls to Rock n&rsquo; Roll and a second called Blk Masonic 1-3 are a must see.<br/>
They can be seen on YouTube.</p>

		<p>It always amazes me that rap constantly uses the &#8220;N&#8221; word over and over in the lyrics. Rappers refer to themselves by that word repeatedly, yet they do not feel that it degrades their race. I will never forget the time I was riding public transportation some years ago and two black men entered and turned up their boom box and loud and proud sang &#8220;I&rsquo;m a n***** in the ghetto&hellip;&#8221;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m 22 and agree with your analysis about young white males and rap.  How many, popular athletes, musicians, movie stars, or military heroes do you see that are masculine white men?  Only in Hollywood are the white male actors masculine heroes, and this is only in movies.  Off-camera they are drug using, liberal, environmentist-wacko, Obama-supporting losers.  </p>
<p>White popular musicians are normally either too sensative (John Mayer, Michael Buble) or members of grungy rock bands with predictable liberal tendencies.  </p>
<p>No where else is this prevalent than in popular sports.  The NBA is 85% black, and the whites are &#8220;role-players,&#8221; not jersey-sellers.  Baseball is being Latinized, and losing influence due to Americans fast-paced ADD mindset.  Football, however, is different.  Although 70% black, a majority of (and all the good) quarterbacks are white.  And the game couldn&rsquo;t be more popular.  It is the last refuge of white superiority in popular culture.  </p>
<p>This country sorely needs a John Wayne.  What the man would say if he were alive today&hellip;</p>

		<p>I have way too much to say on this topic than I could ever type today.  Just a few points:</p>
<p>Understand that the mentality and maturity level of rap and hip-hop peaks at that of about a 17 year old.  Anybody Black or White listening to it beyond that age is proving their mentality.  Thrash metal, pop music, and club music are about the same.  Who are the biggest consumers?  Who is the biggest demographic?  Kids. 12 to 18 year old kids.  It has to speak to them to sell.  Above 18 a normal brain will see beyond the music&rsquo;s immaturity and see it for what it is.  Adolescent noise.  Normal adults have concerns much larger than the ridiculous topics covered in popular music.  I was in high school in the 90&rsquo;s, possibly the WORST decade for music: Grunge and Gansta Rap.  I had to learn at a young age to seek out forms other than the popular garbage at the time.</p>
<p>Point two:  Anybody who tries to convince you that Rap is anything deeper than what we know it is on the surface is delusional.  It is not poetry.  The &#8220;arrangements&#8221; are not brilliant.  The &#8220;production value&#8221; is not genius.  Without their so called &#8220;sampling&#8221; from established past hits from other genres none of thier songs would have any structure at all.  And any &#8220;bassline&#8221; of thumps that morons nod their head to can be duplicated by any 10 year old stabbing a keyboard, hit record, then repeat.  To say that rap is anything more than that is nonsense.</p>
<p>Point three:  Send me to Rap Camp for a month and I WILL duplicate the rap genre to a TEE.  Allow me to practice guitar for decades and I will NEVER be able to duplicate the abilities of Eric Clapton, Duane Allman, Jerry Reed, Chet Atkins, etc&hellip;    </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll plead guilty to being a fan of this genre once upon a time.  But I gave up on it in the late 1990s after it lost what little shred of musical value it had and become malodorous noise with ripped off beats and a heavy bassline.  Ironically, I gave up &#8220;country&#8221; music (at least the &#8220;new&#8221;) stuff at just about the same time, because then it started becoming nothing more than warmed over pop recorded in Nashville, and some of the newer artists were all into flaunting their liberalism (Garth Brooks, Dixie Chicks), and some even used blacks in their choruses.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: Most people who listen to rap really don&rsquo;t enjoy it that much themselves. It&rsquo;s the obnoxiousness value that they enjoy. I&rsquo;d guess the appeal of thug culture is similar to the &rsquo;50s phenomenon of Teddy Boys in England and Greasers in America. Today&rsquo;s &#8220;Bad Boys&#8221; are blacks, or black wannabes.</p>

		<p>If you listen closely, the best comparison to rap &#8216;music&rsquo; is children&rsquo;s music. They are both very simple and have a chorus that repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats. The songs both consist of a bass beat and some jingling with very simple lyrics. The big difference is that one listener is an immature human that needs constant attention and assistance to make it through their day in even the simplest tasks, while the other listener is a baby.</p>
