<h1><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/08/us-chipotle-idUSTRE72752P20110308">Chipotle Workers Quit Ahead of Immigration Audits</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lisa Baertlein, Reuters, March 8 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Workers have been leaving Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc in the nation&rsquo;s capital and Virginia since getting notice that U.S. immigration officials are auditing restaurants in the area.</p>
<p>A survey of help-wanted websites, including Chipotle&rsquo;s own, shows a higher level of hiring in those markets than in others like Ohio, where the company has twice as many units.</p>
<p>Chipotle co-Chief Executive Monty Moran called the departures &#8220;very limited&#8221; and said they came after he told workers that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was reviewing worker eligibility documents at the chain&rsquo;s roughly 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Just a few months earlier, a similar audit resulted in the firing of 450 undocumented workers at the chain&rsquo;s Minnesota restaurants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people in those restaurants  &mdash;  although it was very, very few  &mdash;  decided to sort of opt out at that point or go look for another job. I guess I would suspect that their documents were probably ones that would be suspect,&#8221; Moran said on a webcast from the Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference in Orlando on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chipotle is a Wall Street darling, in part because its labor costs are lower than most of its peers&rsquo;. {snip}</p>
<p>The burrito chain, whose motto &#8220;Food with Integrity&#8221; is based on serving naturally raised meats and other premium food, is on a hiring spree in Washington, D.C., and Virginia.</p>

		<p>This will help the high school and college kids who need an after school or summer job to make ends meet. I feel bad for anyone who is white (or black for that matter) who has to work with a majority of Mexicans or other Hispanics. It is worse if you have a Hispanic boss- you will be treated poorly and they will try to make you leave so that they can bring more Hispanics (more than likely illegal) to work. </p>

		<p>If only ICE would do a sweep of all businesses in the Baltimore/DC/NOVA metro area&hellip; they would find that just about everyone that works &#8220;in the back&#8221; at all major restaurants in the area is illegal. Oh, and in the malls, the illegals aren&rsquo;t just restricted to the kitchen area anymore. There are illegals working in plain sight at the pretzel shops, at the cash registers, etc. It&rsquo;s truly alarming and disgusting to see this everywhere you go in the state of Maryland (it&rsquo;s the same, if not worse in VA). Ten years ago, you&rsquo;d see a few illegals here and there and now you&rsquo;ll see a couple dozen a day depending on where you go. Even the blacks in Baltimore City are being pushed out in some neighborhoods&hellip; the local hospital has been flooded with Mexican women ready to drop baby #3, #4, #5&hellip;. I guess what I&rsquo;m getting at is that even though these immigration audits are a good thing, they&rsquo;re only going to have a very small impact on a very big problem.</p>

		<p>Somebody should set up a website which lists those articles such as this, and articles exposing other corporations and restaurant chains hiring illegals in a collective and coherent way with the aim toward notifying all Americans to boycott forever those businesses.  Beginning with Chipolte.  I will never eat a that restaurant and never have.  Now I will be sure to never eat there.  In fact, I no longer eat at ANY mexican restaurant as I know they are staffed by illegals.   Boycott Dennys also.  The Dennys in our town is COMPLETELY staffed by Mexicans now, most of them illegal.  From manager down to the bus boys and greeters.</p>

<p>And so we see why illegal immigration is never faced up to by the authorities. This years stock price and this years big business campaign donations matter more than the nations interests.</p>
<p>Ever heard the expression &#8216;sold down the river&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>While I was night manager of a restraunt and bar the vice squad came in one night. While they were coming in the front, the kitchen staff was going out the back. After the screen door banged shut for the third time a  customer asked, &#8220;What`s that all about, Tim? They don`t have health cards?!?&#8221;  &#8220;No&#8221;, I replied. &#8220;They don`t have green cards&hellip;.&#8221; I wonder if the customer ever thinks about that like I do.</p>

		<p>Poster #1 mentioned something that I think about all the time for my own kids, who will come of working age soon.</p>
<p>Around here, you NEVER see any white teenagers in any place of employment, from fast food restaurants, lawn care or big box stores.  NEVER.</p>
<p>Time was when you turned 16 or 17 you would go get some entry level job to get some experience and move up from there.  Now every position is filled with a latino.  I mean EVERY position for miles and miles around.  (A lot of American small and large businessmen are treasonous in what they are doing to the nation!)</p>
<p>Where are my kids going to get their first job?  And let&rsquo;s assume they get hired in some place.  Do I want my intelligent, well mannered and reasonably moral kid to be - on the line, in the storeroom, on the sales floor, - with an illegal immigrant or &#8216;african&rsquo; american - both of which cuss and curse NON-STOP and who do nothing but make sex jokes.</p>
<p>I am not exxagerating with the behavior.  I know Spanish, and I work around latino and black teenagers every day.  Shucking, jiving, curse words, sexual references and solicitations - it DOES NOT STOP.  IT DOES NOT STOP!</p>
<p>When I think about my own slow rise through the job ranks, and I realize my children will not have that experience because of illegal immigration, it sickens me.</p>

		<p>I have long wondered about the hiring practices of this chain. Every single &#8216;Chih-Pottle&rsquo; I have gone to, from Virginia to Minnesota, has had hispanic/Latino servers, most of whom cannot (or will not!) speak English.</p>
<p>If it is found that &#8216;Chih-pottle&rsquo; has been ENGAGING in such practices, I think a nation-wide BOYCOTT and demonstrations in front of these eateries would only be &#8216;fair.&rsquo;<br>
After all, &#8216;they&rsquo;re taking the jobs&rsquo; Americans might want,&rsquo; right?</p>
<p>right.</p>
