<h1><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/08/AR2011030806198.html">More Than Half of California Children Latino, Census Shows</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol Morello and Dan Balz, Washington Post, March 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>More than half the children in California are Latinos, according to new census statistics that show the nation&rsquo;s most populous state rapidly approaching the day when Hispanics overtake whites as the largest minority.</p>
<p>Barely one in four Californians under age 18 are non-Hispanic whites, who declined in number along with black children as the number of Asian American and Hispanic children soared. Because of differing birth rates and migration patterns, the total number of children remained relatively stagnant.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Among Californians of all ages, the 38 percent who are Hispanic almost equal the 40 percent who are white, a drop of 5 percent. Even in Orange County, where the airport is named after John Wayne, whites are now a minority and Hispanics make up the largest block of school-age children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hispanics are the future of California,&#8221; said William Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution. {snip}</p>
<p>The census statistics released Tuesday suggest the Golden State is losing its luster as growth has slowed and many of its residents have decamped for states where housing is cheaper. But it remains a harbinger of trends that have broad implications across the nation.</p>

		<p>One of the interesting things about the &#8220;demographics is destiny&#8221; people is the extent to which they are unwilling to look deeper into the issue of provision.</p>
<p>Although it is true that a handful of Mexicans actually work in food production, the vast majority, when they bother to labor at all, work in the production and distribution of drugs&hellip;.and related services (ie prostitution).</p>
<p>My point is that, when you look at collective effort toward survival (building homes, providing food, clothing medicine, etc. maintaining civilization), whites provide almost all that effort while non-whites are GIVEN the fruits of that labor.  And here is the important part..that is unlikely to change.  Few want to but the real issue is far fewer ARE ABLE TO.  There will never be a time, say, when California is 80%+ Mexican and all the effort of maintaining a first world existence is done by them.  They simply aren&rsquo;t equal to us.  They are dependent on us.  </p>
<p>There are limits to this phenomena.  In other words, we can only spend so much on welfare, that is then used to buy drugs, allowing the drug producers to buy all the things people need to live a normal life, before the system collapses.  And who can doubt that the last 5 years are evidence that we have reached that point?</p>

		<p>&#8220;and many of its residents have decamped for states where housing is cheaper.&#8221;: He must be kidding&hellip; what, are all those Hispanics who have come to America so rich they&rsquo;re pushing out all the poor Whites?  My take is that 1) The Asians live separately from everyone else, 2) The Blacks have been murdered out by the Hispanic gangs and, 3) Whites have had it with multiculturalism and are taking what money they have and are moving elsewhere.  The death blow to American came with the 1965 immigration act, but since a large nation such as America will take decades to die, what we are seeing now is the end of the beginning.  The beginning started in 1965 and is coming to an end with Hispanics moving into the majority in multiple states; the beginning phase is basically complete. Next comes the middle phase where the future ethnocentric nations begin to coalesce, Whites moving North, Blacks moving South(east), Asians holding various enclaves around the continent, and the people within each area starting to see themselves as separate from the other groups.  The end of the second phase and the beginning of the final phase comes with the battles of civil conflict and  political maneuver that will decide the dividing lines of our future ethnocentric nations.  In my view, the enemies of America have won.  I only hope we can get the national consitution a little &#8220;more perfect&#8221; when we start out in our future union.</p>

		<p>Look at what the present is like, just imagine how horrible the future will be in California.  Bob Dornan used to be a congressman but lost to a Mexican woman.  He was a supporter of massive immigration but when he lost he started complaining of voter fraud.  Couldn&rsquo;t have happened to a nicer guy.  </p>

		<p>Hmmmmm&hellip; I wonder if this has any correlation with the chronic fiscal crisis in California (by far the worst in America). I live in Silicon Valley and every successful software/hardware company is staffed by whites and foreigners from the east (primarily Chinese and Indian). Next door, San Jose is where all the Hispanics live. The ones that are employed typically do unskilled labor. I personally have nothing against Hispanics, even though they commit crimes at a higher rate but the dilemma is this: (and it&rsquo;s simply an economic one)</p>
<p>Economics is all about trade. I work hard to provide a good or service, and I&rsquo;m compensated via customers who purchase this good or service. With this money, I purchase goods and services, of my choosing, from others who work hard to provide them. Money is merely a representation of goods and services that are traded amongst individuals. Now, in California, the trade is becoming unfair and unequal. One group of people (whites and east Asians) are working to provide computers, software, electronics, cars, machines, and all the advanced devices necessary for a person to have a very high standard of living. The other group (Hispanics) are working to provide tomatoes, lettuce, tequila, clean toilets, etc. </p>
<p>Ask yourself: Where is the trade here? You&rsquo;re going to have to pick a whole lot of lettuce if you want to trade it for an iphone. Obviously there is no reasonable trade here so typically these people, if in small numbers, becomes the permanent underclass (working poor). But if these people start making up the majority, things turn bad fast. The new minority (whites and east Asians), either relocate (white flight) to an area where fair/equal trading of goods and services can take place (where other whites live) or they export most of there goods and live in gated (guarded) communities on the outskirts of town (on the hills). This theory neglects all the social factors (crime, culture, incompatibility, etc) that contributes to white flight, de facto segregation, and income disparities between the races, and purely puts it into an economic context.</p>
<p>What do you think? Feedback is always welcomed.</p>

<p>Meaning California has NO future, only a very dark and foreboding one. All the States in America are on the same path. But to listen to these &#8220;conservative&#8221; talk show hosts nothing seems to be wrong with them taking over our state.  Are they stupid or are they just more than willing to sell Whites down the river? Why is it that not ONE White man or woman in the media ever speaks out and defends their own race for heaven&rsquo;s sake? Why don&rsquo;t they INFORM and WARN their White audiences about the horrible future for their White children?  WHO owns these media jerks anyway? </p>

		<p>The immigration act of 1965 and the federal governments refusal to sheild California from the illegal invasion from the south are to blame for why this once great state is where it is today. During the past twenty years, a mere blip in time, the state&rsquo;s white population has declined by more than two million people. In the mean time, 2 to 3 million invaders and their offspring have decided to occupy the state. And this crisis continues unabated, month after month, year after year, what was once America&rsquo;s premier state, a land blessed with a spectacular climate and unsurpassed natural beauty, continues its decline to third world status. </p>

		<p>I agree with this article that the future of California is to become a Latin state, or at least ran by Hispanics. Who knows what the percentage will eventually become, but remember, there&rsquo;s a lot of different people from all over the world coming here. I would say in the years to come, many &gt;90% Hispanic areas will be recycled and Asians, Arabs and others will build exclusive areas for their own people. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not stopping at the border states. They are in all the states, even Idaho, Colorado, and Utah will become more latinized eventually as they continue to make inroads further north. </p>
<p>You have to remember that the federal government is on &#8220;their&#8221; side and there&rsquo;s not much that can be done about it.</p>
<p>My guess is that it will start slowing down as our standard of living really starts to drop.</p>

		<p>Well if these kids who drop out of school before graduating, can barely read or write Spanish and their knowledge of the English language is a sick joke, are the future of California I&rsquo;d say homes will be getting a lot more reasonable very soon. You can only make so much picking lettuce.<br>
Many of these Mexicans are hard workers but now that they are here they will want California to become Mexico North and they just might get it?</p>

		<p>I fully expected Schwarzenegger to be the last white governor of Kalifornia, but there weren&rsquo;t enough stupid people to vote for the obviously corrupt Calderon stooge, currently pretending to be may or El Lay, Villagairosa.  Also not enough just plain crazy folks to elect SF mayor Newsom.  So it was the perfect opportunity for the Ultimate Tooth Fairy Liberal to make his encore.  Whenever he is done wrecking the state his way the next governor of this state will undoubtedly be a Mexican(pretend hyphen)American, and the unbridled looting and corruption for which Mestizos are known will commence.  </p>
<p>In a few years, the Not-so-golden State will actually be a state of two countries simultaneously.  The money will flow in from the USA to prop up the failed 3rd world state, and most of it will then flow into Old Mexico.</p>

		<p>RE In my view, the enemies of America have won<br>
Well, ask yourself if America is actually all of us all the time or actually only some of us some of the time. That is, is &#8220;America&#8221; something you transport with you, in your thinking and actions or is it a big mass of land between the oceans?<br>
Of course it is the people; and if those special people wish to move and coalesce somewhere else sometime in the future they can and will. So, &#8220;America&#8221; won&rsquo;t really be lost if real Americans with real potential to thrive in the future move out of California, or anywhere, to the land where they can live. I am not denying the importance of physical land to express culture but if it were the only thing cities couldn&rsquo;t fall apart without the people doing so as well, and we all know that isn&rsquo;t true. The value of an educated brain is incalculable. </p>

		<p>This massive influx of hispanics is part is of the plan to merge mexico, Canada, and US into one.  Mexico for the cheap labor, Canada for the natural resources, US to buy the cheap goods manufactured in China, etc.  Barry&rsquo;s talk of creating jobs by putting more billions into building highways, etc is part of this plan.  Those roadways are to transport the cheap goods around in this country and Mexico.  What has actually happened, the drug cartel has taken over those Mexican roadways paid for by US tax money to transport drugs.  The US decreasing middle class has less money to spend.  In the meanwhile, a huge hispanic underclass is forming which will create a tremendous economic burden on this country.  This is further compounded by a decreasing a white population.  This country is well on its way to be a third world country.  To have come from such a glorious beginning and then to throw it all away.  Having a black man in the White House is a sign of the lost identity of this country, sold as a proud symbol of diversity and tolerance.  Another sign of lost identity and control is the allowance of it&rsquo;s religious symbols to be suppressed but yet allowing other foreign ones to be on public display.  All this occurred due to the insidious brainwashing of the white population.        </p>

		<p>Most likely 100 years from now California will be a spanish speaking state. Government meetings, business and documents will be in the language of the land. Schools, colleges and most TV, radio, advertising and internet news will be spanish. Of course this is already happening. Hollywood will make movies with English subtitles. That is the future of California.</p>

		<p>As recently as 1970 California was 80% White. In the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s California was renowned for its great hordes of youthful whites, as strange as that may sound now. Check out all those &#8220;Gidget&#8221; and Frankie Avalon movies to see what has been lost. I just recently saw again Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s classic film Vertigo, set in San Francisco in the very late 1950&rsquo;s. I watched it carefully and saw only two non-Whites (both Orientals) in the whole film which had countless shots of pedestrians and traffic all over the city. </p>

		<p>Great Britain is at exactly the same point, demographically speaking, that California was in 1975 with regards to the non-White portion of the population, and relative growth rates.</p>
<p>     As in California of 1975, this inexorable fact is just brushed aside with indifference at best and active encouragement (eg the Labour Party&rsquo;s lunatic &#8216;open-door&rsquo; immigration &#8216;policy&rsquo;) at worst.</p>
<p>  In 36 years&rsquo; time the Whites of Britain with their heads firmly stuck in the sand, will one day wake up and find themselves &#8216;inexplicably&rsquo; dispossessed of the land of their ancestors.</p>

		<p>Another question, what portion of the 40% of Californians who are described as &#8216;White&rsquo; are actually of pure European extraction?<br>
Also, what exactly is the age profile of the Whites?, is it skewed heavily towards the elderly end of the spectrum?</p>

		<p>It was the Reagan Amnesty of 1986 that delivered the final coup-de-grace to White California - and indeed to White America.</p>
<p>Remember all the lies, spin and propaganda that were used to sell that disastrous policy? - &#8216;It will stop further immigration, &#8216;it&rsquo;s humanitarian&rsquo;, &#8216;they&rsquo;re all hard working, good, decent, family oriented people, only seeking to make a better life&rsquo; etc etc.</p>
<p>  It was that so-called &#8216;great conservative&rsquo; Reagan who bulldozed this legislative atrocity through congress.Why Reagan is remembered affectionately, I do not know - it can be said with justice, that he personally murdered California and the USA for that matter.</p>
<p> As low as many have an opinion of the Democrat Party vis-a-vis immigration and privileging &#8216;minorities&rsquo;, the Republicans have been scarcely better.</p>
<p>     Please remember that, dear reader.</p>

		<p>What I find fitting about this story is that the demographer finishes with an obvious truism:</p>
<p>Demographics is destiny.</p>
<p>Yet whites will not defend a strict immigration policy (even most conservatives say they have &#8220;nothing against&#8221; or are even &#8220;proud of&#8221; legal immigrants) because this would be construed as &#8220;racist.&#8221;  So whites can either:</p>
<p>a) realize high amounts of non-Americans are changing the landscape of Americana and do something</p>
<p>b) ignore this dilemma because to do something about it would be racist</p>
<p>Demographics is destiny because no matter how well-reasoned and logical the arguments of the Tea Party, social conservatives, or the GOP is, non-English speaking minority immigrants will vote for/support the politician that is giving them a handout.  It&rsquo;s as easy as crying &#8220;racist&#8221; and no one will say boo.</p>

		<p>4-Anon: Since you asked, I&rsquo;ll give a response: What we are living in is a human ponzi scheme, where excess labor works for low pay in the service industry while those in &#8220;computers, software, electronics&#8221;, etc. work at higher pay scales at thus live at a higher standard. This gives us a classed society with some people at the top (those living in gated communities) and some living at the very bottom (the poor service workers), eith fewer and fewer in the middle. Eventually, such a situation leads to a revolt of the underclass and the destruction of society. This process though, continues as long as the wealthy can get away with paying less and less for the services they desire.  If, for example, we didn&rsquo;t have an excess of people - that the entire world population consisted of a small island with a homogenous population, the situation would be very different. Those working the service jobs could demand a higher level of pay and possibly unionize, or simply not do the work, even if they might starve.  Usually though, a balance is reached where instead of the few very rich and many poor, you have very few rich, few poor, and a strong, stable, majority middle class population.  Those in the engineering group would earn less, and those working in the service industry earn more on a percentage basis, but the bottom level (welfare/charity cases) is reduced to a level that allows society to prosper and advance.  As it is, our nation has become ever more focused on growth and profit as compared to ensuring stability factors such as a common language, religion and ethnicity, and as such, we continue on a path towards national disolution.  I know is this only stated in general terms, but you had asked for thoughts from others&hellip; And yes, the importation of millions of poor directly leads to a financial crisis. This occurs when society has set in place a generous welfare system in conjunction with basically unrestricted immigration. Any society can provide such welfare within a certain boundary and still provide for research and technological advancement, but beyond a certain point, you have massive debt, failed efforts to maintain the stable middle class, a loss of technolgical investment, and the collapse of a first world society.  Welcome to America in the 21st century. My thanks to anyone who has read this post.</p>

<p>Where I&rsquo;m at now, the latino high school &#8216;students&rsquo;, even if they have been here since birth, barely speak any semblance of proper english above GRADE ONE level.

I am sure our ancestors of the past would never settle for &#8220;there&rsquo;s not much that can be done about it&#8221;&hellip;.when did we become a bunch of neutered wimps and defeatists? If we are then we deserve to die off as a race. If we keep falling for the LIE, then just go jump off that proverbial cliff.</p>
<p>Do we not even love our own children enough to ensure their survival in a WHITE nation that we and our ancestors fought and died for? Yes, a WHITE nation, not a multiracial one!   Seems the enemies of our race has won through their constant brainwashing and dumbing down of our own race, right?  Well, they haven&rsquo;t dumbed me down!</p>

		<p>Of course they would be the dominant ethnic group in California (and eventually throughout the United States). They get to enter our country illegally, take jobs from American citizens, apply for and receive social welfare benefits, and reproduce at higher rates than native-born Americans. All this with the federal and state governments&rsquo; approval. Sounds like brown skin privilege to me!</p>

		<p> There is absolutely no doubt that the Federal Government is against the white race. The government enforces affirmative action, refuses to prosecute voter intimidation of whites, requires set asides, qoutas, preferential college admissions and flat out refuses to label any crime by blacks against white as a hate crime.<br>
 These and millions of other instances against whites lead to the only logical conclusion that the Federal Government is determined to destroy the white race.<br>
 The elite whites that think they are above all of these &#8220;minor problems&#8221; may one day wake up and realise that the other races have no further use for them.  At that point their life will be over.</p>

<p>You are right about Great Britain. I would mention though, that Britain is an island with no borders. It doesn&rsquo;t share a porous and vulnerable border with a third world country. It SHOULDN&rsquo;T have any immigration problem at all. But If the British people are stupid enough to vote for the Labour party then well&hellip;.</p>

<p>Agree completely that &#8220;great conservative&#8221; Ronald Reagan has a great deal to answer for. His 1986 amnesty was a disastrous mistake and set a terrible precedent. It was sold by lies and misinformation. Reagan was not a good president and he didn&rsquo;t &#8220;win&#8221; the cold war. (The USSR lost by default, collapsing from ethnic divisions.) The same thing COULD happen here.  </p>

<p>You are absolutely right. Previous generations of whites didn&rsquo;t trouble themselves for a second worrying about whether or not somebody would call them &#8220;racist&#8221;. They just took care of matters that affected their communities. Somewhere, sometime, somehow in the twentieth century the white race (especially in English-speaking countries) lost their nerve and took leave of their senses.</p>

		<p>There is very little doubt that the increasing economic decay of California is a direct consequence of its demographic change from white to brown. So sad and so needless.</p>
<p>I find a certain parallel between California and Kosovo. In 1900 there were extremely few Albanians in Kosovo just as there were only a minute number of Latinos in California. To any casual observer at the time it would have looked like both places would be part of Serbia and America forever. In the case of Kosovo, Albanians began moving in, largely illegaly, and their ethnic-religious leaders encouraged them to multiply. Albanians in Kosovo supported the Axis in WW2 and took advantage of the opportunity to kill many Serbs and drive out others. All the while they maintained high birthrates. This has a bit of a match in the general indifference to the Axis shown by Latinos in America and perhaps the Zoot suit riots. And nothing needs to be said about Mexican birthrates. Bit by bit Albanians took over Kosovo. They were aided in this by Tito who, was a Croat, and wanted to water down Serb nationalism into a bland multi-ethnic political Yugoslavian federalism (which he naturally controlled). This also has its comparisons in the U.S. globalists in Washington and its egalitarian fellow-travellers. In both cases a variety of factors, some external, some internal, came to undermine the dominant ethnic community in both places. Both actions took place GRADUALLY, much like the metaphor of the frog in the pan of water slowly being heated up. </p>
<p>Here though the comparisons effectively end. In the 1990&rsquo;s the Serbs fought to keep their lands and for their troubles were bombed for 78 days by Americans who had no interest or cause or rights in the matter at all. America now celebrates its &#8220;victory&#8221; that created the &#8220;state&#8221; of Kosovo - the most corrupt country in Europe; a narco, human trafficking, Mafia-like, muslim state.</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t cry foul America when in future decades you lose the southwest and perhaps China bombs you for trying to assert your sovereignty. I could also mention that America only acquired California in 1848. Serbs commemorate the battle of Kosovo in 1389 - a full 103 years before Columbus even set sail. </p>

<p>Read that sentence three times over.  Remember, California has long been and will continue to be the future of America.  When they say that whites will soon be a minority they don&rsquo;t mean that we will be 49% of the population.  They mean that we will be less than 25%.

<p>In 1970 you could have said that black people will be the future of Detroit, and you would have been right.  And we can see every day just what that sort of future means.

My reference was in reply to the post from 4-Anon, so I used his terminology.</p>
<p>27-StevieB: Not so sure I agree here. Desegregation is something which, I believe, could be reversed in a peaceful manner, or maybe with minimal conflict.  The consequences of the 1965 immigration act will more than likely include the loss of physical territory, far greater White displacement and impoverishment, and a far greater amount of bloodshed.  I just don&rsquo;t think they are on quite the same level of overall effect.</p>

But what do you think is the Mexican invader&rsquo;s collective plan exactly? </p>
<p>Is this part of the whole Reconquista of the &lsquo;nation of Aztlan&rsquo; fantasy where they overwhelm various Southern states to eventually gain a voting majority, as to then succeed, break away from the United States as to join the country of Mexico?</p>
<p>Or are they just depositing themselves within the United States, as to claim all the rights, privileges and benefits of US citizenship. <br>
Justified and righteous due to their misled feelings of historical entitlement. While also trying to &lsquo;have their cake and eat it too&rsquo;, in that they get to live in a de facto Mexico, but with all essential services paid for by the US tax payer? <br>
While remaining oblivious to the fact that their presence contributes very little to the overall economy and that they&rsquo;re actually draining/breaking the very system that supports them, thanks to their unsustainable behavior.</p>
<p>Or am I giving them too much credit in terms of having &lsquo;a plan&rsquo;, is it more like the single cell organism in the Petri dish, that simply instinctively moves towards the energy that light and heat emits, as to feed?<br>

		<p>There are also large percentages of hispanics in the Deep South.  Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina have latino populations over 8 percent which is what California&rsquo;s percentage was in 1970.  It&rsquo;s very possible that the heart of Dixie might have latino populations that make up a quarter of these states in 30 years if nothing is done about it and that combined with the black population will make Whites a minority in the region.  Whites in California make up nearly 2/3 of the state&rsquo;s voters because so much of the population is illegal (hispanics and asians too) or legal but non-citizen.  There&rsquo;s still hope but as these people&rsquo;s American born children grow up that hope diminishes.  I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that Whites in California are enjoying diversity as much as they say they are.  It&rsquo;s obviously destroying the state and the economic prospects for them and they either need to rise up and do something about it or their new brown overlords won&rsquo;t be anywhere near as generous as they&rsquo;ve been to them.</p>

The metamorphosis of California shows that Socialism divides whites between eachother allowing the states cataclysmic transition to be low key but swift.</p>
<p>White Californian&rsquo;s were incapable of being real American&rsquo;s because they were less educated and lacked even the contrarian knowledge to racially identify the differences between a Mexican and a Costa Rican.</p>
<p>So as they became Socialists, they accepted all non-whites as long as they received their fill of material desire.  </p>
<p>If white Californian&rsquo;s are incapable of defending their state because they are Communized, will the people of your state be just as misguided?</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s white population sold America&rsquo;s most beautiful state for a higher education and received nothing in return but an illusion.</p>
<p>Yet states in the East are welcoming illegal Mexican&rsquo;s under the table with manual labor that local mayors and citizens are ignoring.<br>

But what do you think is the Mexican invader&rsquo;s collective plan exactly?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexico right now is and has always been a mess, despite the fact that Mexico has ten percent of the world&rsquo;s natural resources and is I believe the 15th wealthiest nation in the world. However, the wealth is concentrated in the hands of few rich elites in business  as well as the Mexican government, which does nothing for its&rsquo; people. As far as the Mexican&rsquo;s plan, it is to come and use America financially and get money. They don&rsquo;t care anything about America, Mexicans are very nationalistic and ethnocentric. Once they get here, they can get work and then free medical care at our hospitals, apply for welfare for their kids and themselves and get it. Mexico is very corrupt and Mexicans frequently use false documents to get all kinds of welfare. Once in large enough numbers, Mexicans start making all kinds of demands in their favor. However, I blame America just as much. Greedy American traitors in business hire them for cheap labor. Our left wing politicians want them here for the votes and our conservative politicans are in with big business and want the cheap labor. The politically correct among us, and their are many, scream &#8220;racism&#8221; if you don&rsquo;t allow non-Whites in illegally. So there is plenty of blame to go around.</p>

		<p>33-GenX ANZAC: In answer, I would say &#8220;All of the above&#8221;.  The few (or more) with the passionate desire to retake land from America are using the benefit seekers as willing accomplices. I would say this is no different than what European settelers did in America in relation to the American Indians.  As long as they let Europeans in, the Europeans came.  Those Indians who finally decided to fight were by then so outnumbered and out-gunned that they eventually had to surrender and agree to live on resevations.  Had the Indians been able to join forces early on, they may have been able to continue their civilizations for a while longer.  I see no historical precedent where such a mixing of disparate peoples ends in peace and prosperity, except where a genocide (displacement or conflict) eventually takes place and where the multiculture becomes once again a monoculture.  As we in the West no longer have the will to fight the invaders, I hope the Muslims in Europe, the Hispanics in America and the Asians in Australia will be kind and give us white folks some nice reservations.</p>

		<p>Some Democrats think that if whites become a minority in the United States, the Democrat Party will be assured of majority status. The only thing we can be fairly confident of is that if whites are in the minority the vast majority of them will vote Republican. East Asians, and immigrants from India do well in this country without anti poverty programs and affirmative action programs. A majority of them may begin to vote Republican. Hispanics and blacks often hate each other. A political party dependent on the support of both groups would be unstable. <br>

By most measures, Harley-Davidson has been having a rough ride. Motorcycle sales are falling in 2010, as they have for each of the last three years. The company does not expect a turnaround anytime soon.</p>
<p>But despite that drought, Harley&rsquo;s profits are rising  &mdash;  soaring, in fact. <br>
 <br>
This seeming contradiction  &mdash;  falling sales and rising profits  &mdash;  is one reason the mood on Wall Street is so much more buoyant than in households, where pessimism runs deep and joblessness shows few signs of easing.</p>
<p>Many companies are focusing on cost-cutting to keep profits growing, but the benefits are mostly going to shareholders instead of the broader economy, as management conserves cash rather than bolstering hiring and production. <br>

The strongest issue for the Democrat Party is the growing income gap. The growth in inequality has been happening since the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Until the presidency of George W. Bush, most whites advanced somewhat in income. Since Bill Clinton left office, most white pay checks buy less every year, while the keep getting richer. <br>
 <br>
In order to address this the Democrats need the support of white blue collar workers. In order to get that support, the Democratic Party needs to support tighter restrictions on immigration, especially third world immigration.  <br>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. Native Born White Americans have foolishly put their fate in the hands of millions of high fertility Meican invaders and their children. Without a doubt we are entering very dangerous times. This is the kind of stuff that causes civil wars, and in the case of the US, a race war. But the reality of th situation is this:The millions of conservative Native Born White Americans who voted for the Republican party-especially in California-voted for this..whether they knew it or not.</p>
<p>It is really shocking when you think about it. California-and America as a whole-was a relative paradise. Now we are looking at the break-up of America into separate race-based nation states. Millions of Native Born White Americans should have seen this commming&hellip;.no excuses. Peter Brimelow is right:It will all end in tears. There will be no point in celebrating July 4th anymore.</p>

John Adams&rsquo; prediction is nearly two centuries old. It has not been borne out. The only time a democracy has failed is when it has not sunk historical roots in a country. After a democracy lasts for two or three generations it is the most stable form of government in history. This is because the majority of the voters will not make 180 degree ideological changes.<br>
 <br>
In 1932 most who had voted for Herbert Hoover in 1928 were disappointed with his handling of the Great Depression, but they still voted for him.<br>
 <br>
In 1980 most who had voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976 felt the same way about Jimmy Carter, but they voted for him anyway.<br>
 <br>
Politics in a democracy resembles Judo. The contestants are evenly matched in size and strength. They try to maneuver their opponents to a position where they are off balance. Then they throw them. <br>
 <br>
Politics under a dictatorship or absolute monarchy resembles Sumo wrestling. As long as the dictator or absolute monarch is stronger than his opponents he stays in power. If he weakens, someone else throws him out. <br>
 <br>
Under a dictatorship or an absolute monarchy a country can go from Czar Nicholas II to Vladimir Lenin, or from the Shah of Iran to the Ayatollah Khomeini in a few months. Changes of that magnitude do not happen in a democracy.  </p>

		<p>I graduated from a minority-white public high school in San Diego in 2001 and I can say that my high school friends are much more racially aware than many of their parents.  San Diego, and California as a whole, is largely a transplant culture where my generation&rsquo;s parents immigrated.  I imagine the first time my parents met a Mexican when they moved here in the 80s, was when they paid some to move them in our home.</p>

		<p>As a &#8220;good ol&rsquo; Southern boy&#8221;, my awakening began in the late &#8216;90&rsquo;s as a travelling film technician.  I was working on a film being shot at Hollywood Elementary School in 1998, just blocks from the former Desilu Studios, among others.  For one scene they arranged to shoot at recess, so that there would be lots of children in the background.  In the hundreds of children running around playing, there was scarcely a white OR black face amongst them.  I remember pointing it out to the other white film crew members (almost everyone on the crew, then) and being met with shoulder shrugs and &#8220;so what?&#8221; </p>

		<p>#51 John Adams is pretty spot on IMHO, if you look at the history of democracy voting was restricted to wealthy men only. Women didnt gain the right to vote until 1920 in the US and later in other locations. Thats less than 100 years ago. The downfall of democracy is that it is an inherently flawed system. Its the tragedy of the commons implemented on a large scale - a democracy will eventually, always, end up being a grazing field for insatiable special interests. This has been known since the antique.  </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</a></p>
<p><br>
John Adams thus merely stated what was common knowledge for anyone with an education at the time. Students arent supposed to learn about history before the 18th century nowadays so I am not surprised that this is not well known. </p>
<p>Any system that aspires to be a long term workable political system have to be set up so that it ensures that people with good judgement abilities (and full mental facilities) make it into the leadership and that people with mediocre or poor judgement abilities does not have any influence at all (because they cant, by their nature, contribute anything positive). Autocratic systems doesnt necessarily pass this test but they avoid the problem with the tragedy of the commons so they are more long term robust. That is why such systems have been the most long lived and common means of government trough out human history. </p>
<p>As for your examples of unworkable systems, both Iran and Russia underwent revolutions and such events are external events in any political system. The dissolution of the democratic united states in civil war will be a logical conclusion of the democratic period in the united states. The end result of the civil wars will likely be a number of fascist states across the former north America. The federal American state is itself turning into a fascist state today just as the ancients of the antique knew it would do - because in their experience, democracy always ends in dictatorship. </p>

		<p><i>Peter Brimelow is right:It will all end in tears. There will be no point in celebrating July 4th anymore.</i></p>
<p>Brimelow is wrong.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t end in tears. It will end with White genocide.  When our numbers fall low enough, we will be declared excess population living on stolen land and slated for elimination.  </p>
<p>Ask White South Africans about the new &#8220;rainbow&#8221; government demanding that their land be turned over to blacks and the hackings, slashings, torture-murders that are being systematically carried out against them while the truly evil western press yawns, more concerned with American taxpayers coughing up more money for &#8220;starving, AIDS-infested Africans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Non-Whites are already being primed to eliminate us Whites as we  are being dehumanized by K-12 textbooks and media such as movies and TV.</p>
<p>Whites are a minority in California.  I receive hate stares daily from non-Whites who I believe will kill me and steal everything I have once they get the chance.  After all, to them I am living on &#8220;their&#8221; land that was stolen from them by evil White colonists and interlopers.  This is what they learn in school as soon as they cross the border.</p>
<p>There will be no tears.  We are fighting for our survival, there will be no place for tears, and eventually no where to run, only kill or be killed.  </p>
<p>It <b>will</b> come down to that.</p>

		<p><i>Really? This thinking is the real problem of far too many White Americans.</i></p>
<p>You are correct that wimpy Whites are part of the problem.  With that stated:</p>
<p>What would you suggest we do, Anon #21?   Every time we Whites try to organize to promote our own rights, the government stomps us down.  Better to keep us atomized and disorganized, easier to eliminate us.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m open to suggestions.  And debate, as long as it remains civil.  The last thing we need  is internecine warfare, there&rsquo;s enough of that already.</p>
<p><i>I don&rsquo;t believe for a second that Whites in California are enjoying diversity as much as they say they are.</i></p>
<p>I live in California and I have never heard a single White claim he enjoys diversity (as we&rsquo;re ethnically cleansed out of our neighborhoods and cities and forced to pay satanic taxes to cover the living expenses of foreign colonists).  </p>
<p><i>But what do you think is the Mexican invader&rsquo;s collective plan exactly?</i></p>
<p>Oz, you and others on this board are looking at this completely upside down. Mexicans are only doing what the US government allows them to do   &mdash;   BOTH DEMS AND REPUBS   &mdash;   against the wishes of Native Born White Americans:  Pour over the border to better their lifestyle by leeching off of White taxpayers.</p>
<p><b>The ultimate goal of the hostile elite that run &#8220;our&#8221; government is to destroy Whites and Western Civilization.</b></p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s working.  We are in a fight for our survival, I give it a 50-50 chance as to whether we&rsquo;ll survive.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to read this tonight: </p>
<p><i>President Barack Obama is calling for more stringent enforcement of existing gun laws, citing the &#8216;awful consequences&rsquo; of gun violence in American society.<i> </i></i></p>
<p>This is another plan of attack in the War on Whites, disarming us and as our numbers fade, it will happen.</p>
<p>All Whites should consider the media, academia, the DOJ, and the majority of both major political parties and, especially the current government mortal enemies of Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>If this is pessimistic, it is only because this is how I see things now from my (dis)advantage point in California, the leading edge of discordance and mayhem that is spreading everywhere:  if you disagree and believe things are optimistic and I&rsquo;m wrong, present proof of how things are getting better for Native Born White Americans</p>

<p>Your rosy depiction of the function of our &#8220;democracy&#8221; is cute.  We are ruled by one party that has two slightly different faces, and this has been the case for about 100 years.  There is no real opposition.  The &#8220;opposing&#8221; parties agree on 90 percent of issues or more. </p>
<p>John Adams&rsquo; prediction came true in 1860.  The original American governing structure died in the War Between The States.  It happened again when the United States went bankrupt in the 1930s and FDR implemented a program of central economic planning ripped straight from Mussolini&rsquo;s playbook that still exists today in many areas.  </p>
<p>The US is a socialist-fascist police state ruled from the judicial bench and through its massive bureaucratic structure.  The appearance of any sort of democracy in this land today is an illusion.  Apparently there are still some living happily in that illusion.</p>
<p>Never forget that it&rsquo;s our so-called &#8220;democracy&#8221; that&rsquo;s brought us where we are today.  I for one don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth celebrating the results of uninformed mob rule.  My vote is cancelled out by the bum at the bus stop exposing himself to old ladies.  How anyone can think this is an agreeable state of affairs, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
