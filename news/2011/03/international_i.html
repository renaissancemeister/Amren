			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sean Parnell, Australian (Sydney), March 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As NSW voters prepare to go to the polls, and the Gillard government works on a sustainable growth strategy, researchers have found immigrants are largely responsible for Sydney&rsquo;s continued population growth.</p>
<p>Graeme Hugo and Kevin Harris from the University of Adelaide, in a draft report of their study for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, have highlighted how immigrants filled the vacuum left by 121,000 people moving out of Sydney between 2001 and 2006  &mdash;  the largest exodus in the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that Sydney, and several other capital cities, are recording net losses due to internal migration is little recognised in public discourse in Australia, where the common opinion is that the largest cities are draining population from the rest of the states,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, the pattern is a longstanding one and in the capitals, especially Sydney, &#8220;the primary driver of population growth is not net internal migration but net international migration.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immigrants have been responsible for more than half Sydney&rsquo;s growth, or two-thirds if the children born to migrants are taken into account, since World War II.</p>
<p>Yet the city is still recording &#8220;huge net internal migration loss&#8221; and even recent immigrants and prospective settlers are looking elsewhere. &#8220;It would seem that aspects of Sydney&rsquo;s environment  &mdash;  be it economic or social  &mdash;  have a negative impact in terms of both attracting and keeping people,&#8221; the researchers write.</p>
<p>Professor Hugo told The Australian yesterday he believed the contributing factors for people leaving Sydney were &#8220;overwhelmingly lifestyle issues and housing costs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Young families, the semi-retired and retired were simply looking for a better, and cheaper, quality of life elsewhere, he said.</p>
<p>Professor Hugo said net internal migration loss had been high for a decade and, although its correlation with immigration was hard to predict, immigrants generally did not settle in the areas Australian-born residents were departing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;white flight&rsquo; argument obviously applies to individuals here and there, but there really isn&rsquo;t any evidence &hellip; to suggest that it has been a major factor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In their draft report, obtained by The Australian under Freedom of Information laws, the researchers suggest governments should support the continued migration of city residents and immigrants to the regions to better distribute the nation&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>Such a strategy would invariably require more funding and infrastructure for the regions and the final report will examine those policy options in more detail.</p>
<p>The researchers also question whether a policy response is needed to deal with recent immigrants in Sydney having twice the normal unemployment rate.<br>

		<p>&#8216;International immigration&rsquo; policies are syncronized among Western governments from Stockholm to Sydney.  Regardless of the stress on water supplies, food, energy, security and identity, mass migration forges on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about growth of the global money supply.  Western governments are puppets to the global financiers.</p>

		<p>This is odd.  For a thousand years, European cities were filled with &hellip; Europeans.  Yet, in the last 50 years, European people have been fleeing their cities, all over the world, and now, even in Australia.  Something must have changed.  What could have caused European-derived people to suddenly want to leave their beloved cities?  The cities that they built   &mdash;   The cities filled with their great buildings, museums, and monuments   &mdash;   storehouses of the great European culture and history.  What has changed?  Why are the cities no longer good places to live?   &mdash;   to raise a family?  </p>

		<p>Sydney is among the world&rsquo;s leaders for the rate of real estate appreciation in the last several years, and is also said to be the world&rsquo;s most overvalued residential real estate market.  The answer to the riddle is that well to do immigrants and bidding Sydney&rsquo;s housing values way up, dispossessing native born white Australians from their own country&rsquo;s most important city.  (Melbourne, yadda yadda, I know, I&rsquo;ve heard the arguments.)</p>

		<p>Is this a current article from Australia or an article from any major city from the U.S. forty years ago?  </p>
<p>Seriously Australia, this is NO surprise to anyone from the USA.  You may not like the fact that this is what 3rd world immigrants do to cities, but that does not change the fact that it is just that.</p>

		<p>So what else is new?  Almost every large city in the U.S. has had whites move out of the downtown area to the suburbs, and blacks and various international minorities take their places.  What is so amazing about this happening in Sydney?  I believe it&rsquo;s a common phenomenon in most white countries.  Maybe because Australia is a younger country than most of the others is why it&rsquo;s noteworthy, I dunno.  Seems par for the course to me.</p>

		<p>I was born, raised and still live in Sydney.  It has become an ethnic hell hole.  The streets and trains are very dangerous places due to such &#8216;wonders of diversity&rsquo; as Pacific Islanders and Lebanese Muslims.  And, of course, Somali and Sudanese misfits deserve a mention here - thanks guys for adding to the &#8216;joys of diversity&rsquo;.<br>
  <br>
These lawless thugs (apart from the Africans) are predominantly first and second generation migrants and the police appear to live in fear of them.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how all this is going to pan out.  The Asianisation of Australia is a serious issue, mixed with these other thugs - it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a rosy future for us whites here.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the average Aussie seems too obsessed with a greedy/materialistic lifestyle to be concerned about all this.  Add to this the left-leaning clowns and MSM that seem to have infiltrated society and we&rsquo;ve got a lot to be worried about.  Are there any places in the US a white would feel comfortable in?     </p>

		<p>Whatever happened to WHITE gangs? Whites have become too nice.</p>
<p>We need a new white underclass to battle these non-white hordes. This will require whites to boost their birth rates dramatically. Whites must stop expecting that every one of their children will be a &#8220;preppie.&#8221; We need numbers and warriors!</p>

		<p>I live in Sydey. A lot of this article is news to me! Yes a lot of retirees do leave the city for a piece of rural or coastal paradise but they usually return (if they can afford to) as soon as they start to have age related health problems. Yes we do have far too many undesireable 3rd world and Islamic migrants here, but fortunately they can not afford to live in good white residential areas and tend to congregate in their own ghettos out in some the city&rsquo;s awful western suburbs. But they do want to live in Sydney just like I do because it is a great place to live.</p>
<p>We have a lot of White &#8220;escapees&#8221; from South Africa here in Sydney, most that I have got to know feel most welcome here.</p>
<p>Yes, we do have politicians here (like most of them) who will not listen to the Australian Public&rsquo;s concern about Afro, Asian &amp; Islamic Immigration.</p>

		<p>How much of this flight is the result of overpriced cities due to public worker Unions?  The cities need stooges to pay high rents and work in fast food restaurants.</p>

		<p>I left Sydney in the late 1990&rsquo;s.  It is very sad and awful how far it has degenerated since changing its demographics so radically in a short period of time.  Sydney is a beautiful city, one of the nicest Ive visited.  Pity it was over run by the damn muslims and other riff raff.</p>
