			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Haya El Nasser, USA Today, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Hispanic population grew more dramatically than expected in states with smaller and newer immigrant populations, according to an analysis of Census data out today.</p>
<p>The 2010 Census counted almost 600,000 more Hispanics than the Census Bureau had estimated in the 33 states for which data have been released so far, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Twenty-eight states had more Hispanics than expected.</p>
<p>The Census count of 38.7 million Hispanics is 1.5% higher than the bureau&rsquo;s estimates.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The underestimates show that immigrants continue to spread into the South and the Midwest from traditional gateways, such as California and New York.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Arizona, the opposite happened: The Census counted almost 1.9 million Hispanics, 8.7% or 180,000 fewer than estimated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The recession was expected to encourage immigrants to return to their countries of origin, but it does not seem to have had a significant impact.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2000, the estimate of 274.5 million was about 7 million short of the Census count. Much of the gap was due to a low estimate of Hispanics  &mdash;  mostly illegal immigrants.</p>

		<p>That&rsquo;s why all of us around here already understood some time ago that the predicted date of whites becoming a minority in their own nation (2050) is about 30 years too late.</p>
<p>In fifteen years we WILL be a minority, especially since our government counts the millions of arabs, turks, central asians, afghanis, persians and on and on, who live here - as whites!</p>

		<p>People say build a wall, but anyone that knows anything about the Mexican drug cartel (or anyone from California, like me) knows that they&rsquo;ve already built several tunnels! The only way to stop this slow white genocide is to create (and ENFORCE) a law that simply says &#8220;If you come here illegaly YOU GET NOTHING!!&#8221; No work, no welfare, no food, no shelter, no education for your kids, no medical care, and by God no citizenship!! </p>
<p>It pains me to be so uncompassionate but these invaders are coming here in swarms for their economic gain and they&rsquo;re willing to break the law to do it. I cannot stress this fact enough, EVERY adult illegal alien is a criminal and should be treated as such and given no rights. It&rsquo;s unfortunate, but when you deal with primitive people, they only understand harsh treatment&hellip; if you&rsquo;re kind and compassionate and tolerant, they will take advantage. These demographic numbers are proof that they&rsquo;re taking FULL advantage of white tolerance.</p>

		<p>Out of curiosity, why does the USA remain the world&rsquo;s biggest and most powerful economy?  It seems odd considering how much diversity poisoning the USA has received.  Can anyone explain this, taking into consideration the racial demographic?</p>

		<p>#3  &mdash;  I&rsquo;m pretty sure the status of The U.S. as an economic powerhouse is eroding and we will soon have a pretty mediocre economy. You can sort of see it happening before your eyes.</p>
<p>Maybe the only reason it has some tenacity is because we have such a large pool of consumers and a large workforce? We&rsquo;re coasting on past achievements.</p>

		<p>to anonymous #2:</p>
<p>It used to pain me being insensitive and having harsh opinions about illegals, but remember they hate us, have no desire to assimilate, and use our tax dollars to fund their agenda against us.  They take advantage of our generosity.  Everytime you feel sorry for them, just remember that they are taking jobs from Americans who have to pay their own bills (and support their own kids), they are bankrupting our country more, they are more of a danger to others because they can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t/won&rsquo;t speak English.  </p>

		<p>3-Anon: I&rsquo;ll attempt an explanation. I do not know the exact year the U.S. became the world&rsquo;s largest economy, but I believe as recently as the late 1960&rsquo;s America was producing around 65% of the world&rsquo;s GDP.  While America has remained an economic power, the rest of the world has be &#8220;catching up&#8221; so to speak. It just takes a while to see changes in world economic standing when considering the large nations. As it is, it seems fairly certain that China, now more capitalist than communist, and with the world&rsquo;s largest population, will at some point surpass the U.S.  But this isn&rsquo;t the main concern which drives a site such as AMREN.  Our main point is that we do not wish to be race-replaced by any other group, whether by those who have lower academic/economic production or by those who have a higher academic/economic production.  In all cases of an infusion of non-Whites, we lose. Thus we have many of the complaints and concerns you see here on this site.  Specifically regarding America&rsquo;s economy, well, we have vast amounts of agricultural land (850M acres last time I checked), many other resources(coal, lumber), and have been at the top of the finance world (reserve currency, etc.) and business capital world for some time.  We will stay at or near the top for some time into the future no matter what kind of immigration we have&hellip; unless we fall apart due to racial, ethnic and/or religious termoil. This is our concern.  Not that we fear any given race, but that we fear for our ethnic future given our immigration policy and the constant anti-White influence of our current (post-1965) leadership.  I am convinced, based upon my understanding of world history concerning the movement of peoples, that the U.S. is setting itself up for an enthocentric breakup.  With that, we will all be poorer, but from our (White race-realist) perspective of maintaining a White ethnic population, even if in a smaller nation, we will at least be able to survive.  I believe your question, as it relates to the complaints here on AMREM, crossed over between America&rsquo;s economic prowess and the racialistic viewpoint of those who post.  In other words, you posted a question outside the bounds of our main concern.  Again, this is my attempt to come up with a reply to your question. As I have no other context to your post, I hope it helps in providing an answer.</p>

		<p>One of the object lessons here is to take Census Bureau estimates with a grain of salt.  This same CB &#8220;estimated&#8221; St. Louis City&rsquo;s population at 355,000 for 2010 (largely under pressure from well placed friends of the Mayor of St. Louis, in order to portray the notion that the City was gaining population), when it reality, it was 319,000, and therefore still losing population.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Its easy to explain: the dollar and world war 2. </p>
<p>World war 2: the USA ended up as holder as the bulk of the worlds gold from arms sales to desperate allies. That gold backed tons of dollars that were spent everywhere building the american empire. In those days gold was money and vice versa. It also helped that the USA was the last industrial state of significant size on the planet that was still standing. The gold dollar lasted until 1972 (IIRC) when it was replaced with the oil dollar and the dollar expansion continued unabated.</p>
<p><br>
The dollar is the worlds default trading currency. When the american banks inflate the amount of dollars in circulation the price of stuff measured in dollars increase. The only way for the rest of the world to get more dollars to pay for their increased oil bills or food bills or whatever is to sell goods and services to USA. In short, paper goes out, tangible wares and services comes in. In &#8220;normal&#8221; nations, you have to export stuff if you want to import. The USA can just print and buy. In normal nations, a declining currency means a smaller trade deficit as people buy domestic or go without. In USA, a declining currency means a larger trade deficit. Today, the federal reserve is outright printing dollars trough the &#8220;Quantitative easing&#8221; programs. This has led to rising prices  world wide, in a normal nation it would just lead to rising prices locally like it just did in Zimbawbe.  </p>
<p>Americans have this idea that USA is different than other nations - I believe they call it &#8220;manifest destiny&#8221; or &#8220;gods chosen nation&#8221; something like that. The truth is more sordid. Its about the dollar and its unique position. That is how a nation that is as dysfunctional and turned from reality as the USA can own an empire and be first world. </p>
<p>Take away the dollar and america is exposed as an underdeveloped economy based mostly on services and raw materials with little industrial activity (and much of it is from the military industrial complex). So, if the dollar goes, then the american empire with its 800 bases world wide (and support organizations like the IMF, world bank and all the &#8220;N&#8221;GOs) soon implodes together with the average american&rsquo;s lifestyle. The biggest threat? China. </p>

		<p>The number of Hispanics has increased very much so here in white Indiana.<br>
Small towns and villages especially, where younger people have left, young and pushy Latinos are pushing out the old whites and turning once charming Italianate buildings and Queen Anne houses into favelas. They are destroying these villages yet many claim they are spurring &ldquo;economic growth&rdquo;.<br>
In my home village of less than a thousand, Hispanics are popping up and causing havoc upon the quiet white population. <br>
How long will we tolerate these barbarian invaders? How long will we tolerate the violence of blacks? Is ANYONE thinking with their brains?<br>
