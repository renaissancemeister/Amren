<h1><a href="https://www.comcast.net/articles/sports-nfl/20110315/Peterson-NFL-Modern-Day-Slavery/">Peterson: NFL Is Like &#8216;Modern-Day Slavery&rsquo;</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Adam Caplan, Comcast News, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The NFL labor situation is &#8220;modern-day slavery,&#8221; according to Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson.</p>
<p>The running back&rsquo;s explosive comments were quoted in a Yahoo! Sports story last Friday, the same day the NFL Players Association decertified and the NFL owners subsequently locked out the players.</p>
<p>Peterson vented his anger about the owners refusing to open their financial books.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Peterson didn&rsquo;t stop there. Many NFL players feel that they aren&rsquo;t being treated as business partners, but Peterson chose a different term for the treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s modern-day slavery, you know?&#8221; Peterson said. &#8220;People kind of laugh at that, but there are people working at regular jobs who get treated the same way, too. With all the money .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the owners are trying to get a different percentage, and bring in more money.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Modern day slavery is this, whites paying for prisons and housing men like your counterfeiting father (or is he out?).  Whites have paid one trillion for affirmative action and cultural diversity for what? so you could complain about being a high paid jock?  if you didn&rsquo;t play football probably you would be in jail.</p>
<p>Best wishes, I wouldn&rsquo;t waste one minute of time or money watching a sport dominated by fools.<br>

		<p>Well, Adrian does have to work six months out of the year. And there is a 78% chance that he will be bankrupt within two years of retirement from the NFL. Actually, Adrian&rsquo;s odds of future financial problems surely exceed the League average.</p>

		<p>And even after all rights of whites were taken away, and whites are only there to work for blacks via taxes and welfare not being allowed or enabled to make kids or defend themselves against genocide, still multi-millionaire blacks see themselves as slaves.</p>
<p>If I would be a liberal, this would be the point were I would have to see, that no matter what happens, the race problems are a never ending story.<br>
The only chance to get over them is to avoid them like Japan did by not letting in anybody. </p>

This article and the one posted yesterday suggesting blacks perform farm labor go to show blacks believe <b>WORK IS SLAVERY.</b></p>
<p>In an unrelated note, I caught a glimpse of the Viking logo. Funny how no white people consider this cartoon image a stereotype, offensive, or derogatory. I guess white people have tougher skin and more sense.</p>

		<p>There was a time not long ago when $1 million a year was considered a king&rsquo;s ransom for an NFL player.  Now $10.72 million a year amounts to &#8220;slavery.&#8221;  Well, our friend Adrian Peterson always has the option of finding himself a new profession.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m calling on the Minnesota Vikings to release him from bondage.</p>
<p>A buddy and I were having a discussion about this sort of thing a few years ago.  He made a very good point   &mdash;   150 years ago, virtually all of the sorts of young, physically talented men who make big money playing pro sports today would back then be qualified for nothing more than farm labor.  And that goes for the whites as well.</p>
<p>Really, I can&rsquo;t imagine the Brett Favre of 150 years ago being anywhere close to a multi-millionaire.  What good would his &#8220;skills&#8221; throwing an oblong ball been to America in 1850?  What good would Adrian Peterson&rsquo;s &#8220;skills&#8221; of running that same kind of ball on the ground have been in 1850?  Favre would have been a farm or ranch foreman at best, and Peterson would have made an excellent cotton picker.  But cotton pickers, even the best ones, made nowhere near the 1850 monetary equivalent of $10 million a year.</p>

		<p>Curt Flood said the same thing over forty years ago. Ended a career of a ball player that was one of the best of all time. Well, too bad. MOST NFL players last only three to four years at that. Ten million a year for three to four years plus pension for life if they make if five [?] years? NOT &#8220;chump&#8221; change. CHUMP! They like to use that word.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t take Peterson&rsquo;s bloviations seriously. I heard this kind of labor-management negotiation whining many times(not recently). Back in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, workers making good money and getting great benefits complained as if they were slaving under sweatshop conditions. Management of firms making excellent profits screeched about the destruction of the capitalist system by pinko labor unions. </p>

		<p>I say fire this guy and blacklist him from the NFL. It won&rsquo;t be hard to find another black guy who runs fast with a ball to replace him. Then he can go back to living on government checks. He&rsquo;ll be much happier that way. To the blacks, WORK = SLAVERY, no matter how much you get paid. Sad.</p>

		<p>Most aspiring athletes of all races would find a $10 million seasonal job to be a welcomed form of servitude. The indignity of it all, having to work for an actual owner of an actual company with a few rulles and requirements of its employees. Most of the players will have careers of five or six years. Adrian, if you pout and sit out, you might lose seveveral million dollars, or is that chump change that Massa doles out to the house slaves? </p>

		<p>Considering slavery has, at least in the West, risen to the hallowed levels of the N-word, I&rsquo;m a little surprised there is minimal backlash against Peterson (or other NFL personnel who have made this exact observation - there have been quite a few) about trivializing slavery.</p>

		<p>Jedderman (#8) said: <i>Curt Flood said the same thing over forty years ago.</i></p>
<p>In that instance he was right. The old &#8220;reserve clause&#8221; allowed teams to unilaterally extend player&rsquo;s contracts at will. In effect, it bound a player to a team forever, unless he was traded or released. Like it or not, prohibiting people from seeking new employment once their contracts have expires <i>is</i> a form of slavery. The fact that all sports leagues now have free agency makes Peterson&rsquo;s whine all the more ludicrous.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the US Army has its own &#8220;reserve clause&#8221; separate from the traditional stop-loss program. A soldier who re-enlists after 10 years does so without a discharge date, meaning the Army can forcibly retain him for life if it wants to. The only sure way out is to fall under the &#8220;up or out&#8221; criteria by not getting promoted. I found this notion unbelievable when I first heard about it in 2002, but the local recruiter confirmed it. <br>

<p>As with the n-word, it all depends on who is using it. Blacks have impunity to say and repeat any ridiculous claim and be applauded for saying it. The old double-standard.</p>

		<p>So, it&rsquo;s obvious that blacks in US of A will gladly pay to watch a black slave toiling under the hot spotlights. Will they continue to pay once his fame and money are gone, or is that just a little too much to bear, an ex-slave without money or a future, and only himself to blame!</p>

		<p>When I retired two years ago, I was earning 75K per year. I worked 45 years. By no means was I earning 75K all those years - my first job paid 6,500 a year, but let that pass. Still, at 75K per annum for 45 years, my lifetime earnings were a little over a third what he&rsquo;s set to make in one year. If he&rsquo;s a slave, what was I?</p>
