<h1>Census Finds Black, Hispanic Diversity Rising in Metro Area</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tom Troy, Toledo Blade, March 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Toledo and its suburban neighbors became more ethnically diverse as the numbers of Hispanics and African-Americans increased and the white population declined, a review of new numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau shows.</p>
<p>Toledo&rsquo;s white population fell by 36,190 people between 2000 and 2010, or 17 percent, while the black population grew by 3,686, or 5 percent, and the Hispanic population grew by 4,090, or 23.9 percent. Toledo&rsquo;s official census fell from 313,619 in 2000 to 287,208 in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s that old white flight still going on,&#8221; said Neil Reid, director of the Urban Affairs Center at the University of Toledo. &#8220;I suspect it&rsquo;s the old story of people who can get out are getting out, and there&rsquo;s a race component to that with the white people leaving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virtually all the municipalities and townships in the area became slightly more racially balanced during the decade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ohio&rsquo;s white population fell 2 percent, from 84 percent to 81.1 percent, not including Hispanics. The population of blacks increased 8 percent and Hispanics increased 63 percent. The Asian population grew by 45 percent and the American Indian population declined by 2 percent.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As to the trend toward fewer whites and more African-Americans and Hispanics, he [Rob Ludeman, a longtime city councilman and area real estate agent] said, &#8220;I think that&rsquo;s predictable. African-Americans and Hispanic families might have more children. I don&rsquo;t want to stereotype but that might be a possibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>The white population of all Ohio cities with more than 50,000 people dropped 12.8 percent, from 1,758,028 to 1,532,894. The black population held virtually steady, dropping less than 1 percent, from 851,488 to 845,770. The Hispanic populations in those cities increased 52.4 percent, from 105,556 in 2000 to 160,844 in 2010.</p>

		<p>When I was younger I thought white flight was due to irrational color prejudice. Now I know it is because when blacks move into a white working class neighborhood the crime rate goes up, way up. It should not be dangerous to say that in public. It is. That is why I am on the lam from the Thought Police. </p>

		<p>Native Born White Americans will always vote with their feet against &#8220;the blessings of diversity&#8221;-so do Liberal Immigration Enthusiasts. It is the job-mission of those of us in the Native Born White American Patriot Movement to explain to our fellow Native Born White Americans that they are running out of places to run to and 2) just what exactly are they willing to give up to accomodate a very rapidy growing population of high fetility post-1965 nonwhites. In fact one of the first things that we should be asking our fellow Native Born White Americans is this:do you want to be a racial minority in an &#8220;America&#8221; with a billion- people mostly nonwhite-with massive population growth with no end in sight&hellip;is the future you want for children and grandchildren..what responsible Native Born White American Adult would want this for their children and grandchilden? </p>
<p>Frame the issue the right way so as to induce a very sick-nervous feeling in the stomach of our fellow Native Born White Americans for this is the  prequisite mental state for revolting againt race-replacement&hellip;or we continue  on the highway to a hellish dystopia&hellip;and it will all end in tears.</p>

<p>There you have it folks. What we&rsquo;ve been saying all along. &#8220;Diversity&#8221; means ethnic cleansing of whites. And remember, &#8220;diversity&#8221; is the noblest of all goals.</p>

		<p>Look, I know that latinos are growing as a percentage of the population in every city, small town and suburb in every corner of this nation.  Their rate of growth is SO STAGGERING in its speed and sheer numbers.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I drive around and see so many latino faces - for miles and miles around in every direction of travel in this once great major city - I am left wondering: are there THAT many people in Mexico or the Dominican Republic that they have MILLIONS of excess population to throw at us EVERY YEAR?  </p>
<p>Really now in 20 years we now have more latinos than many latin american countries, and they keep coming in by the millions each year?</p>
<p>Breathtaking in its scope, don&rsquo;t you agree?</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a potential disaster in the making for blacks and Hispanics in the urban areas where they appear to be migrating.</p>
<p>If economic meltdown is not a likely possibility, then inter-tribal warfare is, plus a half dozen other calamities.</p>
<p>The urban areas will be islands of disaster during any kind of chaos that might occur.</p>
<p>The country could well be a giant Katrina situation. </p>

		<p>I believe this puzzling phenomenon has been called &#8220;white flight.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s truly baffling about this trend is the motivation of whites in trying to reject the clear benefits of multiculturalism.</p>

		<p>In Europe, many of the latest generation of Muslim immigrants are showing lower birth rates.  Hopefully, a similar pattern will manifest in the US with the Latino population.</p>

<p>I thought the same in my youth. My parents knew better. TV and public education were able to convince me my parents were wrong. I&rsquo;d like to add that it is just not the crime rate that goes up. The general level of civility goes way down. </p>

		<p>When a relative lived in Toledo area in the early &#8216;90&rsquo;s, I visited a very nice, all white enclave, and only saw non-whites in the &#8216;inner city.&rsquo; Fast forward twenty years.</p>
<p>This summer, I had to drive across country, and stopped at a Hotel 6/8 chain, which is rather far south, near the interstate, from that earlier &#8216;inner city&rsquo;- the clientele (as well as the staff) made me feel I was either in South Africa, or New Dehli. I feared for my safety, as well as the possessions in my car. And I am over six feet tall.</p>
<p>My relative is now long dead, and I will not be stopping in Toledo anymore, just as I now avoid going through Detroit, for similar reasons. Tourism dollars won&rsquo;t go, where American Whites won&rsquo;t. You think the CoC in cities such as Toledo would &#8216;get a clue.&rsquo; Nope. Multicultural mania is now their operational credo.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s going to get to the point that, in order to list and sell your house prior to moving away from black criminality and blight, you will be required to PROVE that you are NOT moving due to &#8220;racism&#8221;.  Some city is going to enact a measure dictating just that.  You heard it here first.  Why?  Because cities realize that blacks don&rsquo;t pay taxes, thus civil services and schools go unfunded when whites leave the city.  They will come up with some way to tax whites heavily prior to leaving, or to prohibit white flight resulting from &#8220;racism&#8221;.  You can take that to the bank.  </p>

<p>Bill if it ever came down to such laws being passed you can bet on it that lots of people, including myself, will abandon their houses and let the bank repossess it.  Cities can either allow us to put these homes on the market and attempt to sell them or face another devastating mortgage meltdown.</p>
