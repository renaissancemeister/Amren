<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">It is fitting to begin our interviews
with Jared Taylor, the founder and chief editor of <i style="">American Renaissance </i>magazine. For Taylor, more than any other
figure over the past decade and a half, has succeeded through his magazine and
his periodic national conferences in creating an intellectual forum in which
white rights advocacy, white nationalism, and white ethnic assertiveness could
be shifted from the redneck margins of society to a position, if not of
mainstream respectability, at least of cultured urbanity and general
intellectual seriousness. Taylor is in many ways a most unlikely figure to have
carried out this project. Raised in Japan by Christian missionary parents,
Taylor attended Japanese schools throughout his childhood and adolescence where
he learned to speak fluent Japanese. He went on to attend Yale University and
later worked and traveled extensively in West Africa. He also studied in
France, where he received a graduate degree in international economics from the
Paris Institute of Political Studies. His cosmopolitan and peripatetic background,
however, did not prevent him from moving gradually in the early 1980s to adopt
a white-centered view of American nationality and to develop the conviction
that cosmopolitan and multiethnic societies are much less successful than those
consisting of a single dominant ethnic group. While viewed by many as a
highbrow racist, Taylor himself strenuously rejects the racist label and claims
that his views on race and nationality are moderate, commonsensical, and fully
consistent with the views of most of the great statesmen and presidents of
America&rsquo;s past. All human beings are by nature tribal, Taylor contends, tribal
in the sense that they all have a special affinity for  &mdash;  and a natural loyalty
toward  &mdash;  the members of their own race. White people, he says, have their own
legitimate racial interests, just as the members of all other racial and ethnic
groups do, though white people, he adds, have been slow to realize this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The interview of Jared Taylor on
December 21, 1999, by Russell K. Nieli is printed with kind permission of the
interviewee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">White people have allowed other groups
to organize and defend their racial interests while doing nothing to defend
their own. This situation, Taylor believes, is akin to unilateral disarmament.
Like many of the other interviewees in this volume, Taylor believes that the
high incidence of various social pathologies among non-Asian minorities in
America is at least partially the result of differing genetic endowments,
though he also believes that bad social policies and the reigning liberal
agenda on race have made these problems much worse. Taylor offers no concrete
vision for the future racial landscape of America, though it is clear from his
remarks here that he vigorously opposes affirmative action policies that
preference racial minorities, antidiscrimination laws that restrict private
associational rights, and immigration policies that are shifting the racial
demographics of America away from the previous white majority.</span></p>

<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Interview:
</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Could you explain the nature of <i style="">American Renaissance</i> magazine? What is
its underlying philosophy, its stated mission, and the sorts of people who
write for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The purpose of <i style="">American Renaissance </i>is to discuss issues that are of interest to
whites. After all, every other racial group in the country has groups and media
organs that speak for them, and the purpose of <i style="">American Renaissance </i>is to speak for whites. Its subsidiary purpose
is to convince a larger number of whites that it is legitimate for an organization
or for a publication to in fact speak for them. Most whites are not convinced
that they have legitimate group interests, so another purpose of <i style="">American Renaissance </i>is to convince a
larger number of whites that it&rsquo;s entirely legitimate for them to have group
interests that may sometimes be in conflict with the interests of other groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">As far as <i style="">American Renaissance</i>&rsquo;s philosophy is concerned, that&rsquo;s a very long
subject, and I think we might have to go about that in a somewhat more
piecemeal manner. I think perhaps you could summarize it in the most economical
terms by saying that the position of <i style="">American</i>
<i style="">Renaissance </i>is that race is not a
trivial matter of either individual or group identity, and that it is a mistake
to try to build a society  &mdash;  as the United States has been trying for perhaps the
last forty or fifty years   &mdash;  to build a society in which race can be made not to
matter. I think that the architects of the civil rights movement, both white
and black, those who were most enthusiastic about it in the 1950s and 1960s,
would never have anticipated the end of the century in which race is still an
extremely salient characteristic in the social life of the United States. I
think they would be surprised because at that time they misread human nature. They
seemed to be working on the assumption that race was in fact something that was
ultimately trivial. The stylish way to look at it these days, of course, is to
say that race is not biological, that it is merely a social construct. I don&rsquo;t
know anyone who was putting it in those terms at that time, but that was the
thinking. What we find today is that people still do sort themselves out quite
reliably on the basis of race. In elections, they very frequently vote for
candidates of the same race. The United States is scarcely more integrated
racially today than it was in the 1950s and the 1960s, and I think that&rsquo;s
because once again race is a salient and significant biological and social
fact. I suppose you could say that that is the major assumption that underlies
the positions <i style="">American Renaissance </i>takes  &mdash;  that
race is important and race matters, and it&rsquo;s folly to try to build a society on
the assumption that it can be made not to matter.</span></p>

<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Interview:
</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">And the magazine is specifically geared towards
white people and towards the interests of white people?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">It&rsquo;s not geared towards white people in
that sense. We have a surprisingly large number of black subscribers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Interview: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">What would
interest a black subscriber in your magazine?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I think there are many black
subscribers who share our view that race is a significant matter. In fact, when
I talk to Americans about racial consciousness and about the legitimacy of
racial consciousness, blacks understand this much more readily than whites
because they themselves <i style="">have </i>racial
consciousness, and they have group interests that they make no bones about
expressing and advancing. It&rsquo;s whites for whom the idea of racial consciousness
has been turned into something that is, if not irrelevant, then even loathsome.
Because blacks understand their own racial interests, they find it much more
straightforward to imagine that whites can have racial interests, and I think
that gives them an interest in what racially conscious whites may be thinking.
For my own part, I find it interesting to read the black press  &mdash;  for example, <i style="">The Final Call</i>, Louis Farrakhan&rsquo;s
magazine, or the <i style="">Amsterdam News.</i></span></p>
<p><i style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">The black press expresses black
interests more explicitly than any other press, which is exactly what you would
expect, and I think for anyone who has a consciousness of race and is conscious
of the kinds of group conflicts that race can give rise to, it&rsquo;s very
interesting to see how other groups in their organs that are directed to their
own group approach these same questions. And I think for that reason blacks
would be interested in <i style="">American
Renaissance</i>.</span></p>

</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Besides your black readership, which, one would
imagine, is only a small portion of the total readership, could you tell us
something about your readership in terms of demographic categories. What sorts
of people are attracted to the magazine and what are their reasons for wanting
to read it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">We did a reader survey some years ago.
My recollection is that, oh, something on the order of about 75 percent of the
readers or subscribers were men, they tended to be of an average age of about
forty to forty-five, they are overwhelmingly college educated, and they have
above-average household income. Also, they tend to be conservative in their
political views, and my recollection is that about half of them pronounce
themselves to be Christians. The other half expressed no particular religious
orientation.</span></p>

any strategies for increasing your circulation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Do you advertise, for instance, in
like-minded magazines, in college newspapers, or over the Internet?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">We have a web page on the Internet that
sometimes brings in new readers. There are two primary ways we increase
readership. One is through radio and television appearances by myself.
Sometimes they bring in quite large numbers of new subscribers. The other is
through direct mail, the way every publication tends to increase readership. I
don&rsquo;t doubt that you get solicitations in the mail all the time for various
kinds of publications. We do the same thing. We rent mailing lists and we send
pitch letters out to people who read other magazines that we think would
suggest that they have a view of the world that would be compatible with ours.</span></p>

tell you that he&rsquo;s been successful &hellip; never sufficiently successful &hellip;
but sure, it&rsquo;s growing all the time. This is about our tenth year of publication,

<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Interview:
</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">How would you characterize the current state of
race relations in America?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I think race relations are essentially
unchanged for the last forty or fifty years. I think that the greatest set of
problems having to do with race is simply inherent to multiracialism. There has
never been a multiracial society on the face of the earth in which there was <i style="">not </i>racial friction, and in fact the
most stable multiethnic or multiethnic societies that I can think of have been
ones in which there was some kind of quite firm hierarchy of different groups,
whether it be in the United States  &mdash;  if you&rsquo;re just speaking of blacks and
whites, for example  &mdash;  or South Africa. Whatever one may think of apartheid, it
was a stable situation, as was slavery, if you will. These things can continue
for years whether one considers them just or unjust. In the past also, say in
the Austro-Hungarian Empire, generally there was a group that was considered
dominant &hellip; when you have multiethnic groups, you have a kind of overclass
and an underclass. You&rsquo;ll find the same thing elsewhere. The Tutsis tended to
be the aristocratic class and dominated the Hutu in Rwanda and Burundi. The
Sinhalese and the Tamils in what is now Sri Lanka, they were in a hierarchical
relationship at one time, too, but now once that hierarchical relationship
disappears, you find them in conflict. This is a fairly reliable pattern that
you see around the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Race, of course, isn&rsquo;t the only source
of group conflict. Probably language may be the most fertile source of conflict
after that, but any kind of group identification, be it religion, language,
race, culture, tribe, all of these things are sources of friction  &mdash;  far from
being the kind of source of strength that we have been encouraged to take them
to be. But as far as the United States is concerned, I think, well, there are
many, many subsidiary aspects of this problem, but, as I say, the great
source  &mdash;  the original problem, the original sin, if you will  &mdash;  is the attempt to
try to construct a society of such disparate racial elements. Any society that
attempts this will encounter the very problems we have always been wrestling
with, and I think for that reason, race relations have always been America&rsquo;s
greatest challenge. And, in fact, you can describe them as America&rsquo;s greatest
failure, but I think that they are inevitably a failure, given the way human
nature is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">If you want to be more specific about
race problems and what causes them, that was an aspect that I think I explored
pretty thoroughly in my book <i style="">Paved with
Good Intentions</i>. At the heart of our race problems is the assumption in the
United States today that when nonwhite groups  &mdash;  specifically blacks but also
including Hispanics  &mdash;  when nonwhite groups are less successful in America, their
differences in achievement when compared to whites must be attributed to white
racism and white wickedness. I think that, by and large, this is a mistake. I
think that the different racial groups are different biologically, and they
differ on average in their intelligence, and that&rsquo;s, of course, why we never
have this problem with Asians. Wherever you look, Asians outperform whites
academically and financially, and so you would suspect that this nonwhite group
that is doing better than whites would somehow cause a little bit more
widespread skepticism about the white-racism-as-the-cause-of-nonwhite-failure
theory. We don&rsquo;t find that this Asian anomaly is much of a reason to doubt the
prevailing view that all the problems of nonwhites can be attributed to whites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">In any case, in my view the differences
in achievement are largely due to differences in inherent ability, and it is the
unwillingness of America at large to recognize these differences in ability
that I think are the cause of a certain very specific set of problems you see
in the United States today. I think that most people, for example, accept the
fact that blacks are, for biological reasons, the better athletes, certainly in
many sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">And no one therefore assumes that the
fact that the National Basketball Association is 80 percent black is a result
of some kind of systematic antiwhite or anti-Asian or anti-Hispanic racism. On
the other hand, if we discover that most of the mathematicians and physicists
and research scientists in the United States are white or, in fact, Asian, then
we insist on assuming that some kind of institutional racism is throwing up
vicious barriers to advancement for blacks and Hispanics. I think the analogy
is, whether one likes it or not, an almost perfect one, between basketball and,
for example, nuclear physics. People who do nuclear physics do it because they&rsquo;re
good at it, and people who play professional basketball likewise do it because
they&rsquo;re good at it. To assume that we have to have some kind of perfect,
mathematical-geometrical equality of representation in all these fields I think
is to overlook the significance of race and the biological aspects of race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Another aspect of this problem is that
by constantly blaming whites for the failures and shortcomings of nonwhites,
our society is, despite I think the best intentions, teaching nonwhites to hate
whites. After all, we are constantly telling blacks that it&rsquo;s those racist
bankers who won&rsquo;t give you loans, it&rsquo;s those racist policemen who arrest you
despite your innocence, it&rsquo;s those racist teachers who expect you to fail, it&rsquo;s
those racist television producers who portray you in a bad light  &mdash;  racist this,
racist that, white society is just seething with racists. How can blacks help
but grow up disliking or even hating whites? I think that if we have a real
problem of outright, visceral racial hatred in this country today, it&rsquo;s not a
problem of whites hating blacks, it&rsquo;s more a problem of blacks hating whites.
And you find this in the overwhelmingly lop-sided crime statistics when it
comes to the different races committing crimes against other races. You also
find it, I think, in the kinds of statements that you see publicly made by
blacks about whites, the equivalent of which would be very, very difficult to
find in any kind of public figure &hellip; public white figure speaking about
blacks. So this notion that the failure of blacks specifically  &mdash;  and now
Hispanics have been brought into this game to a large degree  &mdash;  this idea that the
failures of blacks and Hispanics can be attributed directly to white racism,
past or present, is first of all wrong. Second of all, it creates hostility
toward whites in the minds of blacks and Hispanics, and I think it creates a
whole set of unnecessary guilt-related problems for whites. So aside from the
great racial problem that inevitably arises simply from having different races
in the same territory, I would put this first and foremost in characterizing
America&rsquo;s current racial problem, namely, this assumption that the failures of
blacks and Hispanics can be attributed to white maliciousness or white
wickedness.</span></p>

<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Interview:
</span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">It seems as if your views on some of the underlying
causes of racial problems have changed in recent years. Today you stress innate
biological differences, but in your book, <i style="">Paved
with Good Intentions</i>  &mdash;  which was published in 1992  &mdash;  the main message seems to
be that the real problem with blacks is that they don&rsquo;t act enough like Asians,
and that if they did, they would be able to integrate successfully into
American society. Clearly, you want to suggest in your book that blacks need to
become more responsible parents, that they have to stop blaming whites for all
their problems, that they have to learn to work hard and save money, and it
would seem as if your message is a hopeful one that looks forward to some kind
of future integration of African Americans into American society. Yet now, in
your more recent writings, you seem to have abandoned the integrationist vision
for some kind of not-too-well-defined separationist one, and see black problems
rooted not in bad habits which are correctable, but in bad genes which cannot
be changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Could you
explain the transition of your thinking on these matters?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I have completely
abandoned one point of view and adopted another. In <i style="">Paved with Good Intentions</i>, I simply made no attempt to expound on
the biological point of view. I think it is certainly the case that blacks are
likely to be psychologically handi-capped to some degree by the conviction that
they live in a racist society full of racist white people. I think that if I
were a racial minority in some other country and I were convinced that the
majority was constantly sharpening its knives trying to think of new and exotic
ways to skin me alive, if I were convinced that at every turn, there were
racist people trying to block my progress, I think that I would find that very
dispiriting and discouraging. I think that to the extent that blacks do believe
that, I think that it can be a psychological obstacle for them. I think that
blacks, instead of constantly blaming whites for their shortcomings, if they
did try to take more individual responsibility for their success and their
failure, I think there could be a not insignificant improvement in the
circumstances of blacks. I think one of the most telling social statistics in
the United States today is the fact that approximately 70 percent of black
children are illegitimate. It is very, very difficult to argue that somehow
white people are responsible for this, although many blacks and a number of
whites have come up with Rube Goldberg-type explanations to try to pin this on
racism. But just that one statistic alone, I think, is symptomatic of a whole
terrible set of obstacles that blacks are setting up for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Now, this said, I think that the kind
of improvement that dismantling psychological barriers would result in is
nevertheless limited by differences in average intelligence. Ever since the
First World War, we have this very, very well-established difference in average
IQ of one standard deviation, and no one, <i style="">no
one </i>has come up with some kind of environmental intervention that will
narrow that gap. At the same time, we have a considerably less than one
standard deviation difference between Asian IQ  &mdash;  North Asian IQ  &mdash;  and white IQ. I
think that, too, is a result of genetics, and I think that that is what
explains the dominance of Asians in certain fields, and their lower rates of
illegitimacy compared to whites, their lower crime rates, their better
achievement in school, their higher average incomes. I think that we are living
in a time that has willfully blinded itself to biological differences that
every previous generation took for granted. The differences between men and
women, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! Now it has become somewhat more possible to talk
about the differences in the natures of men and women, but there was certainly
a time a great many people would have agreed with the proposition that, for
example, the sexual appetites of men and women were inherently no different
from each other, and they would have explained the fact that there is a great
deal of female prostitution and very little male prostitution as simply a
result of social training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Well, I think now most people would
concede that these are the result of inherent biological differences. And so I
see a certain amount of progress in recognizing biology in that respect, but
the resistance to recognizing the reality of biology as far as race is
concerned is still tremendous, and I think that this unwillingness to recognize
it is going to hamper any kind of attempt to try to minimize differences,
which, although attributed to environment, I believe are caused by genetics.</span></p>

this also a view that you held when you wrote <i style="">Paved with Good Intentions</i>, but for whatever reason, didn&rsquo;t
emphasize or mention at the time of writing it?</span></p>

Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">My views were similar to those I hold
today, but they weren&rsquo;t as well elaborated. I wasn&rsquo;t as well informed about the
research on IQ as I am today, but generally I had those same views. One of the
reasons I didn&rsquo;t write about IQ differences in <i style="">Paved With Good Intentions </i>is because it probably would have been
impossible to get the book published if it had made a point of trying to
explain these racial differences in terms of inherent abilities. It&rsquo;s still
very much a radioactive subject and was probably, if anything, even more
radioactive then than it is now. I thought I had a great many things to say
about race that were worth considering aside from that, and if I had to, if I
had to keep that in the background, or suggest it only by implication in order
for these other ideas to be considered &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t like doing it, but there
was kind of a compromise there.</span></p>

a book that&rsquo;s only eight chapters long, this is a considerable emphasis. Could

<p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Jared
Taylor: </span></b><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Not a great deal. Of course, preference
policies are based on this assumption that it&rsquo;s white racism that keeps blacks
and Hispanics from achieving at the white level. The idea seems to be that, oh,
evaluation methods for job applicants, for applicants for university places,
all of these are somehow biased. By weighting the scales in favor of these
disadvantaged groups, we can somehow get them into environments where their
real abilities will flower and that they will eventually find themselves
achieving at the levels of whites, and perhaps of Asians. I think it&rsquo;s a
well-intentioned policy, but it results in the kind of discrimination which, if
practiced to the benefit of whites and to the detriment of blacks, would be
instantly denounced as unconscionable racism. I think affirmative action racial
policies of this kind are an inevitable outgrowth of this will to universal
equality, be it the male  &mdash;  female, be it racial, be it social classes, this
tremendous desire that everything and everyone be equal, coupled with a willful
blindness towards the biological effects of race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">In a way, although I would never have
guessed it at the time, I think that racial preference policies are an
inevitable result once you pass a law like the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That
law forbids racial discrimination in employment, for example, and in a number
of other things as well, but the only way that you can demonstrate lack of
discrimination satisfactorily to those who will suspect you of it is to show
that you have people of all different races equally represented in every level
in every function. In order to achieve this, you&rsquo;re going to have to have
racial preference policies. In other words, you have to engage in racial
discrimination in order to convince a suspicious third party that you are <i style="">not </i>engaging in racial discrimination.
We have an absolutely absurd situation in the United States, and anyway things
are changing now, and I foresee the eventual demise of official racial
preferences of this kind, but for the past couple of decades, we had a
situation in which whites who were opposed to racial discrimination directed at
themselves were, of course, accused of racism. It&rsquo;s really a topsy-turvy,
Alice-in-Wonderland state of affairs, but once again, I think it derives almost
inevitably from this overwhelming desire for equality of outcome, coupled with
an absolute unwillingness to investigate biology. But if you&rsquo;re asking whether
I was ever a victim of racial preferences of this kind and that this somehow
fueled my interest in this, the answer is no. I may have been a victim of some
kind, but I&rsquo;ve never been particularly conscious of it.</span></p>

number of years ago you wrote a book about Japanese culture but didn&rsquo;t indicate
at that time that you had any special interest in American racial issues. How
did your interest in this area come about?</span></p>

have a satisfactory answer for it. I was born in Japan. I lived there until I
was sixteen years old. I was for that reason a racial minority, I suppose. I
attended all-Japanese schools, and children are very conscious of differences.
To some degree, I was picked on because I was different, but, believe it or
not  &mdash;  and most people refuse to believe this  &mdash;  I say it with as much conviction as
I can muster, I don&rsquo;t think that experience had any effect whatsoever on my
current racial views. When I left Japan at age sixteen to come to the United
States to go to college, I was very much a conventional liberal as far as race
is concerned. My views on race didn&rsquo;t change &hellip; well, they certainly didn&rsquo;t
change while I was in college, and it was only gradually as I studied history
and as I did a fair amount of traveling  &mdash;  I spent several years in West Africa  &mdash;  it
was a process of time and various experiences. There are very few particular
discrete events that I can point to. I realize that may seem unsatisfactory to
you, but I just don&rsquo;t have a good answer for that question.</span></p>

right. That was a huge, huge, huge media hullabaloo, and I remember thinking,
well, wait a minute, wait a minute, if America is this horrible racist country,
this sort of thing should be happening all the time. Why is this such an
enormous media event? Why are we wringing our hands so dismally over this
particular crime? I remember that that was one that struck me as very strange,
whereas you would read about killings of whites by blacks with no particular
investigation into their racial motives, and even if racial motives were
uncovered, there was no national hand-wringing that went along with it &hellip;
that&rsquo;s a double standard many people are aware of, and it&rsquo;s one that probably
nudged me in the directions I was already moving in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">I think perhaps living in Africa made
me more open to the possibility of biological differences between the races.
There you see Africans in Africa, and you encounter a certain inertness of mind
and spirit among many Africans. It&rsquo;s not universal, of course, and partly it
has to do with endemic diseases, but I think that that began to open my mind to
the possibility of there being biological differences that were mental as well
as physical. Of course, as soon as you start looking into at least the race and
IQ question, there&rsquo;s just a tremendous amount of literature out there, and I
ended up finding it quite convincing. The attempts to refute the geneticist
point of view on these differences, although they get a lot of popular
acclaim  &mdash;  books like <i style="">The Mismeasure of Man </i>by
Stephen J. Gould, for example  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re not even very honest, but they&rsquo;re just
not convincing. I think science and the facts all line up in a very, very persuasive
way to support the view that there are these biological differences.</span></p>

pronouncements diverge so sharply from private opinions as in the area of race.
Do white people, in your experience, say things in private about race that they

white people that I move in, it tends to be somewhat unusual in this respect.
They say in private the very things they say in public, but I think that&rsquo;s
unusual. Well, let me just give you an example. I think actions, after all,
speak louder than words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Take our beloved &#8220;Great White Father&#8221;
William Clinton. He has been praising racial diversity for a long time, and he
looks forward to the day when differential birthrates and increasing nonwhite
immigration will reduce whites to a minority, and yet I suspect he couldn&rsquo;t
name a single, nonwhite neighborhood that he&rsquo;d like to live in. I think that
there&rsquo;s a tremendous hypocrisy about this. If I&rsquo;m feeling mean, I&rsquo;ll sometimes
ask a racial liberal, I&rsquo;ll ask him is integration something worth striving for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New  Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Is it important for blacks and whites
or Hispanics, people of different races, to be together more often than they
are? And almost invariably they&rsquo;ll say that it is important, and yet I know of
no one who has for that reason decided to buy a house in a Mexican
neighborhood, or a Haitian neighborhood. Here is a profoundly significant and
important act of integration that each one of us could perform. I know of no
one who has done that, and I think that in that sense, people&rsquo;s actions do
speak quite loudly. Whites don&rsquo;t want to live among large numbers of nonwhites.
They don&rsquo;t like it, and although very few of them will say so, they certainly
act upon those impulses when their neighborhood or their school or their church
becomes nonwhite. I think that it&rsquo;s pure hypocrisy to pretend otherwise. I
forgot what your question was.</span></p>

Foundation, of which I am president, just conducted a poll. We hired one of
these polling firms to do this, and we asked the question two different ways.
One of the questions was: Would you prefer to live in a neighborhood where your
race is the majority or your race is a minority? We offered three different
replies. One was, I prefer that it be the majority, the other is that I prefer
it to be a minority, and the other is that it makes no difference.</span></p>

that part of the problem in the United States has to do with an unwillingness
to tell people that it is their own fault. Blaming the victim is almost a
cliché phrase these days, but I think there is a real hesitancy among any kind
of public person, certainly a politician or journalist, to say, &#8220;Well, yes,
these people are poor because they&rsquo;re lazy,&#8221; or, &#8220;These people are in jail
because they&rsquo;re just bad.&#8221; And I&rsquo;m not restricting these observations to any
particular racial group. I think there are plenty of whites who are a very bad
lot, and they deserve to be in jail, and they deserve to be poor. Now that may
sound like a very heartless thing; on the other hand, I think that charity  &mdash;  and
I make this case pretty strongly in <i style="">Paved</i>

should be voluntary, and not engineered by the government, but that&rsquo;s more a
principled classic libertarian position than one that has anything to do with

libertarian view of social or economic differences.</span></p>

of increasing racial tension is our immigration policy. Up until 1965, we had
an immigration policy that was designed, I think, to keep the country white. I
see absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, I think that&rsquo;s a healthy,
normal, and natural position for a country to take. I think Japan should stay
Japanese. I think Mexico should stay Mexican. Some think somehow that it&rsquo;s
virtuous of the United States, after having been founded and built by
Europeans, according to European institutions, to reinvent itself or transform
itself into a nonwhite country with a Third World population. I think that&rsquo;s a
kind of cultural and racial national suicide.</span></p>

jails in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and certainly lots in many parts of Texas and
California, that are sometimes in a virtually constant state of lockdown
because Hispanic and black prisoners will be at each others&rsquo; throats if you let
them mingle in the day rooms. Or when prisoners riot, one of their first
demands is almost invariably that they be separated by race. They don&rsquo;t like to
be mixed up together, and, after all, prison is a kind of forced intimacy with
strangers that many of us can&rsquo;t even imagine, and to share that forced intimacy
with people who are of different races and who often have quite a strong racial
consciousness, this is an extremely disagreeable experience. But, once again,
this kind of experience, which has become increasingly common, of having to
deal with some kind of racial tensions or racial barrier, this problem has been
terribly exacerbated by our immigration policies. We now have, oh, groups of Haitians

		<p><i>My views on race didn&rsquo;t change &hellip; well, they certainly didn&rsquo;t change while I was in college, and it was only gradually as I studied history and as I did a fair amount of traveling &mdash; I spent several years in West Africa &mdash; it was a process of time and various experiences. There are very few particular discrete events that I can point to. I realize that may seem unsatisfactory to you, but I just don&rsquo;t have a good answer for that question.</i> </p>
<p>I believe I also recall hearing Mr. Taylor  &mdash;  perhaps in a YouTube video  &mdash;  telling the story of when he was in Africa and he crossed the border from one country to another. In the first country the roads were decent but in the second they were a shambles. When he arrived at university, he asked someone about it. &#8220;That&rsquo;s obvious! The man replied. The other country had the benefits of colonization!</p>
<p>My own &#8220;awakening&#8221; was when I read a Reader&rsquo;s Digest article on the sorry state of Africa, and I decided to type in the query into a search engine &#8220;Why is Africa Poor?&rsquo; or some such and was led directly to American Renaissance. I became fascinated by the subject and ended up reading every back issue in the archive, and I&rsquo;ve been &#8220;hooked&#8221; ever since. </p>
<p>The truth was always in the back of my mind, having grown up in Gary, Indiana and seeing firsthand what happens when a city goes from white to black, but it was like a breath of fresh air to be able to articulate what I could never quite put into words or even feel morally justified in thinking. I&rsquo;ve been hooked ever since.</p>

		<p>Taylor has global overview outside of USA. He has intellectual observations and honesty that few among US are willing to speak.<br>
I first noticed the Continents and the cities/neighborhoods of different racial interests. I asked myself why living standards were less. I know colonialism and poverty is not real story.  I observed Patterson, NJ and Washington DC after riots. The deserted homes occupied by invaders became ghettos within a few years.  This made me aware of differences denied in public schools I attended.  Later I worked with different racial ethnic groups and it bacame most obvious their racial interests came before the universalism I was taught to believe. Race is the biggest elephant in the room! Most black countries have dictators and prefer group communism. The USA was made to legislate away its private sector to please racist groups. <br>
 No one grants US credit for the goodness we share with others.  Race is divisive. Tribalism is human nature.<br>
I think most race games are robbery. I have to give up who I am &amp; what I have earned to please a legislated group think.  V</p>

		<p>Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s story about the poll of Americans&rsquo; preference of the race of their neighbors is a great example of how race is looked at by even mainstream conservatives.  White Americans have a naive mindset about race, diversity, and the future of their ancestors.  Whenever a typical white American is inclined to feel uncomfortable around foreigners, blacks, or Hispanics, he tells himself some lie  &mdash;  ignoring his baser instincts and sense of survival.</p>
<p>As a conservative, I used to lie to myself, saying the same thing you hear a Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh say.  I used to truly believe (despite evidence to the contrary) that race didn&rsquo;t matter and if only immigrants assimilated all would be well.  Of course, this is hogwash.</p>
<p>Culture is created by people, and people are highly prone toward genetic limitations and benefits.  White ethnics who have been in the US a much shorter time than blacks have assimilated much quicker, in fact within the second generation.  Asians also do a good job of assimilating and finding productive niches.  Hispanics, due to a language barrier and close proximity to their homeland, do poorly, however eventually are more assimilated to traditional American values than blacks.</p>
<p>These facts scream a genetic explanation.  As an educated, intelligent, thinking American, I knew this all along  &mdash;  but even I was blinded by a wishful, naive, colorblind answer to the problem of racial differences in the US.  If thoughts of anti-immigration or anti-black culture crept into my mind, I replaced them with a distractive thought, either by blaming political liberals or Hollywood values for &#8220;destroying the black family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Taylor, I feel blacks can do better.  Genetics aren&rsquo;t the only determinant of one&rsquo;s future, individual choices are.  Blacks (and whites) are much more likely to cause problems when they are raised in single-parent households.  A reversal of this disturbing trend won&rsquo;t make blacks indistinguishable culturally from most whites, but it will reduce crime, improve race relations, and benfit society.</p>
<p>I truly thank free-thinkers like Taylor who can see past the post-modern, inane dogma of modern culture and point out the obvious.  After all, people are still highly segregated, and happiest in this lifestyle.  Until Americans can acknowledge differences exist among races (and shouldn&rsquo;t lead to moral indignation), we will indubitably fail.  Because when genetics trumps our myopic views of a &#8220;raceless&#8221; culture, we will be searching for answers within a confined box that grants as the premise all groups are inately equal.</p>

		<p>Wherever you look, Asians outperform whites academically and financially, and so you would suspect that this nonwhite group that is doing better than whites would somehow cause a little bit more widespread skepticism about the white-racism-as-the-cause-of-nonwhite-failure theory. We don&rsquo;t find that this Asian anomaly is much of a reason to doubt the prevailing view that all the problems of nonwhites can be attributed to whites.</p>
<p>In any case, in my view the differences in achievement are largely due to differences in inherent ability.<br>

		<p>&#8220;There has never been a multiracial society on the face of the earth in which there was not racial friction, and in fact the most stable multiethnic or multiethnic societies that I can think of have been ones in which there was some kind of quite firm hierarchy of different groups, whether it be in the United States &mdash; if you&rsquo;re just speaking of blacks and whites, for example &mdash; or South Africa.&#8221;</p>
<p>True- down here in South Africa where I live- the white people are the minority and &#8216;underclass&rsquo; who are being labeled and called &#8216;racists&rsquo; by the rulers and future rulers like Julius Malema an Jimmy Manyi, who freely sing their own racial hate and genocidal songs of &#8216;Kill the Boer&rsquo;- and reflected in the black -on-white murder rate. For myself- I only pray for the safekeeping of my wife and children and KNOW that the Almighty today is the same as in 1836 when my forefathers were miraculously saved at the Battle of Bloodriver. </p>

		<p>Having grown up and come of age in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s I always heard that the main reason European immigrants came to succeed was that once they and their children learned to speak English without an accent they were home free because of so called White Skin Privilege. This was not available or possible for blacks or Hispanics, that is why they are so down trodden. I believe this lie has been put to rest by the sight of so many non White non English speaking people leaving blacks and Hispanics in the dust in just about every category you could think of, and also for the vicious hatred of them. Just to name a few off the top, economics, education, criminal behavior, self reliance, and rates of marriage. For me that is case closed. </p>

You lost too many brave patriotic young men in the Civil War &amp; WW1&2 who didnt procreate or diffuse their values plus the multiculty nature of Western Christianity hastened the current state of affairs.</p>

		<p>Ref. Post #04 &#8220;differences of achievement are largely due to differences in inherent ability&#8221;</p>
<p>Relative high mental ability seems to permit university students these days to have a leftist inspired  &#8220;improvised morality&rsquo; and especially so regarding feverish sexuality.   The sexual licentiousness  of the campus seeps  on down to the rural villages and the urban ghettos with conspicuously sad and tragic consequences.  Much of the social-personal failure at the base of the social pyramid is a result of the destruction of traditional constaints rather than being a direct result of low intelligence.  In seeking to break the chains of the poor, the left does a very impressive job of breaking their lives.    </p>

<p>I do not recall any reports of looting after the Minneapolis bridge collapse in 07.  They did have one problem however, an excess of volunteers to help after the disaster. Maybe the response could have been more &#8220;American&#8221; if they had acquired more Somalis.  They are just too lily white.</p>

		<p>Thank God for men such as Jared Taylor and Lawrence Auster. Not too long ago I used to think that race could be divorced from culture, and that a conservative emphasis on renewing a national primary culture could effectively combat multiculturalism. Even then I had to modify that position by saying that only blacks above one standard deviation could be intelligent enough to support and/or contribute to such culture, while the rest would have to be dragged along more or less unwillingly, and would relegate themselves to self-segregation. </p>
<p>However, I now see where I was wrong.  As always, it took a while for me to comprehend, and when I did so, it was because a significant phrase finally coalesced in my mind (such is the way my mind works):</p>
<p>Racial identification is most often the precursor to cultural identification.</p>
<p>I now see this is a fact of life.  It is reality unencumbered by theory. And the inevitable conclusion?&hellip;  Unless whites have a solid majority of the population in some geopolitical entity, they will never be able to impose their culture, i.e., the American culture, on other non-white immigrants, who identify too closely with their own originating cultures because of race.</p>
