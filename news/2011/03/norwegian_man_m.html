<h1>Norwegian Man Moves out of &#8220;Norwegian&#8221; Town</h1>
  
<p>Andreas Slettholm, Aftenposten (Oslo), March 23, 2011</p>

</div> 


<p>[Translation by Google Translate]</p>
<p>Patrick Åserud has had enough of the pressure, salami-free lunches, blonde safety and poor language environments.</p>
<p>- I will not let my children grow up here. That I do not take a chance on.</p>
<p>He has decided. After a lifetime of Differences in Oslo, has in recent years&rsquo; Patrick Åserud scared away. This summer he moves with his wife and daughter from kindergarten Furuset and out of town.</p>
<p>He moves from a local community he believes is about to crack under the weight of failed integration. Disturbing stories</p>
<p>- It&rsquo;s been hard to be ethnic Norwegian in Groruddalen. It&rsquo;s about massive language problems, as well as a pressure to adapt to the norms that feels totally alien to us who have a Western way of life and thinking.</p>
<p>- There are nursery schools where almost no children or parents speaking Norwegian, and schools where children are being threatened with a beating to bring a packed lunch of salami.</p>
<p>- Girls are bullied for being blonde, dark hair and colors to fit into. It is not okay to be gay at school, not an atheist and certainly not a Jew. Especially the last three years have been frightening to see and hear about what&rsquo;s happening, &#8220;said Åserud. A majority of parents need an interpreter</p>
<p>He said the day care job. It is not at least 15 years as an educator in schools and kindergartens that he marks an increasingly inequitable distribution of ethnic Norwegians and minorities on the body.</p>
<p>- We had to have an interpreter in 10 of 18 parents conversations. What kind of opportunities do you really create good environments and providing a good working relationship with the home, then, asks rhetorically Åserud. Thousands have gone from the valley</p>
<p>He feels that it is he and his family who must be integrated as a minority in their own country.</p>
<p>- I have been positive and optimistic in the past. But there is a limit when it gets a majority who do not speak Norwegian well. We are many who feel this strongly, regardless of skin color. An Indian family knows I expected to live as Muslims because they are brown in the skin.</p>
<p>- Many people will probably think that you are sensitive and out of step with the new Norway?</p>
<p>- If so, there are very many who are sensitive. Ranking is that people move here. They do so because of the concrete experiences they have had, &#8220;Åserud.</p>
<p>Figures from Statistics Norway support the claim. There are now 3000 fewer ethnic Norwegians Groruddalen than just two years ago. Depopulation occurs faster than before, but over time the figures speak clearly: Groruddalen has lost 20,000 ethnic Norwegians in the last 15 years, despite population growth. Ethnic Norwegian-share has dropped from 82 to 56 percent in 15 years. Fears Malmo-states</p>
<p>And this year is Åserud part of the statistics. He takes the family to Hamar.</p>
<p>- We have no connection there, but we could not afford the house on Høybråten, Røa or other places where we do not feel strange at nærsenteret says Åserud.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not a good recipe on how development can be reversed.</p>
<p>- It&rsquo;s hard to say. I fear Rosengård-states (charged to the suburbs in Malmo, journ.anm). There fired shots in the street on average once every week. I want the best for the city, but I do not feel I can carry the integration on my shoulders, &#8220;said Åserud. Facts: This is the case</p>
<p>Last week, told Aftenposten that 4 in 10 parents seeking skolebytte for their children in some minority schools.</p>
<p>Headmasters confirms that the minority share is given as the reason for their flight. School researcher Ivar Morken believes that schools are &#8220;society&rsquo;s dustbin,&#8221; because they are thrown into the demographic problems that can not be solved by the schools themselves.</p>
