			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pete Kasperowicz, The Hill, Feb. 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black lawmakers on Monday said GOP-proposed budget cuts would move the country in the opposite direction of the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>The lawmakers, all members of the Congressional Black Caucus, used the last day of Black History Month to argue the GOP-backed cuts would fall hardest on black Americans. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s really especially poignant that this year during Black History Month, the Republican leadership has proposed a budget for fiscal year 2011 that will fall most heavily, mind you, on the backs of the most vulnerable in our society: African Americans, Latinos, and poor, those who have been shut of the American dream,&#8221; said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who described the cuts as ill-timed and destructive. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>H.R. 1 would cut more than $61 billion from current funding levels, but is not expected to move forward in the Democratic Senate. However, the House on Tuesday is expected to approve a two-week spending bill that cuts $4 billion from current spending levels. The $4 billion in spending reductions would include hundreds of millions of cuts in education, health, housing, energy and water programs.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Del. Donna Christensen (D-Virgin Islands), who led the debate, said the GOP cuts threaten to bring the U.S. back to a time when &#8220;America was not in her finest hour, a time when the poor, the rural and people of color were denied equal opportunities to education, healthcare, jobs with decent wages and protections, and the possibility of homeownership. We cannot and must not go back there.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Hopefully barf bags were issued before these clowns began speaking. Talk about &#8220;special pleading&#8221;!</p>
<p> Imagine if several White Republican congressmen had gotten up to plead for smaller cuts than those proposed by Democrats because they would &#8220;hurt White people disproportionately.&#8221; The Leftist media would have a collective cow, Jesse and Al would be foaming at the mouth, and the Southern Poverty Law Center would brand the GOP a &#8220;hate group.&#8221; As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m amazed the SPLC hasn&rsquo;t done so already.</p>
<p> Black politicians in general (with a few exceptions) could win a special award for public statements that tend to be (a) emotional; (b) non-sensical; and (c) self-serving. Those quoted in this article from The Hill are perfect examples. I rest my case.</p>

		<p>Of course if you ask these people where else we should cut the budget, it would just affect another group of whiners. They complain and moan about it, being totally out of touch with the fact that the money is just not there and borrowing more to float the downtrodden of society is no longer an option if the government wants to address out of control spending and deficits.</p>

<p>Ah yes, we must not go back to those &#8220;bad ol days&#8221; of balanced\surplus budgets, accountability, law and order and being TRUELY respected\admired all over the world.<br>
Does  this idiot ( Donna Christensen D-Virgin Islands ) REALLY believe that THIS is Americas finest hour!</p>
<p>Lets break this down - <br>
*denied equal opportunities to education - they now have preference over Whites in ed. and black schools get MORE money than White schools. They&rsquo;re failing more now than in the bad ol days.<br>
*healthcare - because of the over use of jobless &#8220;people of color&#8221; our healthcare system has become much more expensive for White working people and is on the verge of collapse.<br>
*jobs with decent wages and protections - they now have AA jobs that they haven&rsquo;t earned and those jobs are protected by counless &#8220;civil rights&#8221; groups.<br>
*and the possibility of homeownership - giving them their &#8220;possibility of homeownership&#8221; caused the current financial crisis.<br>

		<p>I should hope that most Americans would approve of pulling back our current system of racial spoils and racial privilege, a system, incidentally, that only blacks, among all our various racial and ethnic groups, seem to require. Whatever their potential may be, it will never be achieved by allowing them to operate under a different set of social, occupational, and behavioral standards than all the rest of us.</p>

Top it all off with their idol Ronald Reagan, who when he opened his presidental campaign, did so in Philadelphia, Mississippi, with a pledge to put Black people back into their place.  With his so called war on drugs, he made it legal to discriminate, and since it was and is illegal for aconvicted felon to vote, this stripped people whose only crime was addiction, of their right to vote.   </p>

		<p>No one has &#8220;shut them out&#8221; of the American dream.  They have done it to themselves due to their dependency on government hand-outs, lack of ambition, sheer laziness, and genetic inferiority.  I am Native American - no one handed me anything.  Retired from the U.S. Air Force, earned a graduate degree in special education, contributed to society by teaching with the Department of Juvenile Justice.  I did it ALL without expecting a hand-outs from anyone.  You can&rsquo;t help someone who doesn&rsquo;t want to help themselves.</p>

		<p>Can you even possibly imagine in your worst nightmare the phenomenal bitching and whining that will ensue when the mutt messiah is turned out in 2012? This is nothing. <br>
There will be riots everything and cities will go up in flames. They will be calling it rigged and who know who it will all shake out since you are dealing with inferior brains who while genetically inferior still will lie cheat and steal plus murder rape and assault whites at will 24/7/365.</p>
<p>We know the old party of Lincoln will do their best to get a blueblood to run against the mutt and will not stand for a Palin or even a Trump.</p>
<p>We know that if Palin or Trump or both since Palin would be a good TParty VP with Trump as TP GOP ticket but in that case the oldhead lib Bush elite Lincolnite GOP would vote for mutt or stay home. </p>
<p>The TP needs to also call themselves TP-GOP or just TP to erase themselves from the stigma of the Lincolnite scourge name and association in order to better ID who they are. </p>
<p>Clearly the DNC is planning on the 2 factions of the GOP shooting themselves in the foot to kepp their mutt in the WH another 4 yrs. </p>
<p>Undoubedtly if a Trump-Palin ticket prevailed the Bush types would all vote for their mutt hero Obama. </p>

		<p>Then the black lawmakers should speak up like the rest of us. No one mentions the fact that ALL Americans will take a back seat to the real &#8220;entitlements,&#8221; which are the handouts to foreign countries and the upkeep of illegal aliens. Why are these little items never mentioned? Can you imagine the billions of dollars we send to countries all over the world? Why? Are we buying friendship? And the billions spent on people who laugh at our laws, and commit crimes that would not have happened had they not been here. The drain on our social and natural resources are a serious factor. The courage to send these people home must be found the next time we elect a leader. He/she has got to see what unlimited, mass illegal/legal immigration is doing to this country and demand that we take care of our own and let the rest of the world do the same.<br>

		<p>Wait, my fellow liberal whites and black bigots.  I thought the whole &#8216;Civil Rights&rsquo; thing was about not being discriminated when it came to employment, housing, education, and not getting lynched at random (like that really happened as often as they claimed.)  Where in the &#8216;Civil Rights Act of 1964&rsquo; does it say blacks and other non-whites are entitled to money?  Where does it say they are entitled to money and not subject to penalities for not paying it back?</p>

		<p>Afro Economics is truly fascinating. There is no emphasis on production, sacrifice today for tomorrow i.e. delayed gratification, no rule of law, property rights, a valid legal system. It is all the Politics and Economics of Resentment and focusing on what the Other (Whitey) has and scheming to take it. </p>

		<p>16 Standing Bear:</p>
<p><i>No one should be surprised, the GOP has demonstrated it&rsquo;s disdain for every component of the Civil Rights Act over the years</i></p>
<p>After having voted for it at a greater percentage of its Congressional representation than Democrats.  Other than that, Republicans spent all their time trying to undo the very law they voted for.  Likely story.</p>
<p><i>Starting from the day they welcomed the Dixiecrats into their ranks.</i></p>
<p>You might want to get a clearer understanding of the Southern Strategy.  The purpose was to trick Southern whites into voting Republican with campaign rhetoric and nothing more.</p>
<p><i>Top it all off with their idol Ronald Reagan, who when he opened his presidental campaign, did so in Philadelphia, Mississippi, with a pledge to put Black people back into their place.</i></p>
<p>That speech in that place is so wildly misinterpreted.  PJB admitted later that the purpose of that speech was like I said above, part of the &#8220;trick southern whites into voting Republican&#8221; strategy.  There was nothing Wallace-esque about that speech at all.</p>
<p><i>With his so called war on drugs, he made it legal to discriminate, and since it was and is illegal for a convicted felon to vote, this stripped people whose only crime was addiction, of their right to vote.</i></p>
<p>Except convicted felons can vote in most states.  Only in FL and KY are they not allowed to vote at all after the felony conviction.  The catch is this   &mdash;   In most states where ex-cons can get voting rights back, it&rsquo;s not until after they are out of prison and complete with probation.  The rub is that so many black men can&rsquo;t stay out of trouble long enough to get off probation.  (&#8220;Doing life on the installment plan.&#8221;)  And there are exceedingly few convicted felons whose only crimes are drug possession   &mdash;   MOST of those &#8220;drug criminals&#8221; who are both convicted felons and have never dealt drugs (dealing is punished way more severely), have committed other felonies, such as burglary, robbery, etc. as a direct consequence of their having a drug habit.  Either those other crimes appear on their rap sheets, or they&rsquo;re plea bargained out in exchange for a guilty plea on the drug possession charge.  In which case they don&rsquo;t appear on the rap sheet, so it only appears that such a person is being punished so harshly just for having some crack or weed.</p>
<p>Too, the crack-powder disparity that you probably whine about?  Black civil rights leaders WANTED it in the 1980s, and they demanded that crack be treated so much more harshly than powder cocaine, because of the damage that crack was doing to black neighborhoods.  Even though a substance by itself can&rsquo;t do damage to anything, you have to have some people doing something with it to do damage.<br>

<p>Memphis whites have been doing this for years, and the only thing it accomplishes is driving away the supportive revenue base provided by a host population and forcing the dependent group to contrive means to get at their funds via annexation and consolidation, forced or otherwise. The black population will not be happy until it drives away enough whites that Shelby County becomes a ward of the state, requiring a draining revenue from the coffers from the productive 2/3 of the state of Tennessee to subsidize an increasingly shiftless and violent populace.        </p>

		<p>None of this will matter once the money runs out.  And trust me&hellip;it WILL run out.  Because the Fed is trapped by political paralysis in D.C., the only thing it can do is print money.  This is going to create a raging inflation which will eventually spiral out of control: hyperinflation.  At that point, there will be no government.  What then, libs?</p>

		<p>This brings up a point: what this is saying is that blacks are dependent on the government for their standard of living. The Congressional Black Caucus is, in effect, stating that blacks have been unable to set up their own economic infrastructure and become independent, this despite decades of government programs. Of course, it could be blacks are dependent <i>because</i>  of government programs, that they have become a constituency group funded by the taxpayer. Perhaps what the Congressional Black Caucus fears is that blacks might actually become independent and thus no longer need the feds to prop them up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;With his so called war on drugs, he made it legal to discriminate, and since it was and is illegal for aconvicted felon to vote, this stripped people whose only crime was addiction, of their right to vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, because nothing screams &#8220;responsible voter&#8221; like a physical dependence on crack cocaine. And it&rsquo;s not like drug addiction that &#8220;just happens&#8221;. It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s generally the result of a series of bad decisions, combined with poor impulse control (which is probably why so many of the drug addicts are black men).<br>
In any case, most states allow convicted felons to vote once they&rsquo;re done with their sentences.</p>
