<h1>Yoss Law Firm Going out of Business</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James H. Burnett III, Miami Herald, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The firm once known as Adorno &amp; Yoss issued a statement Monday confirming that it &#8220;will continue to provide legal services to its clients and will continue to conduct its regular business through March 31, 2011,&#8221; in its Miami and Fort Lauderdale offices, but after that would go out of business permanently.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Then known as Adorno &amp; Yoss, the firm made national headlines in the early 2000s, when it was revealed that it stood to collect a $2 million fee for representing the so-called &#8220;Lucky Seven&#8221; residents who had successfully sued the city of Miami over $90 million in illegal fire fees. </p>
<p>While the fees were determined to be illegal for upwards of 80,000 people, only the seven represented by Adorno &amp; Yoss shared in the $7 million the firm negotiated with the city.</p>
<p>The Lucky Seven had collectively paid less than $100,000 in illegal fire fees.</p>
<p>Driven by public outrage, the city sued Adorno &amp; Yoss and recovered the money awarded to the Lucky Seven. In 2008, Adorno &amp; Yoss agreed to pay $1.6 million, as part of a $17.1 million settlement with taxpayers in Miami, to put the matter to rest. When the dust settled, the law firm was awarded $400,000 in fees.</p>
<p>Last October, the Florida Supreme Court suspended the firm&rsquo;s co-founder and former namesake Henry &#8220;Hank&#8221; Adorno for orchestrating the lopsided fire fee payouts to the Lucky Seven and the law firm. </p>

								<h2><a href="https://www.jdjournal.com/2011/03/15/29255/">Yoss LLP To Dissolve At Month&rsquo;s End</a></h2>
						<p>The largest minority-owned law firm in the United States will dissolve at the end of the month.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After Adorno&rsquo;s suspension, the firm dropped his name from their title, but the firm has been hit with partner departures and layoffs ever since. Since then, they&rsquo;ve lost nearly 75 lawyers. <br>

<p>Please help Drudgereport by sending him submissions of AmRen links with Amren by-line comment.  He&rsquo;s doing a good job of posting hate-Whitey news, which helps our cause immensely.</p>
<p>Prejudice is righteously virulent, because it is written onto our hearts by the finger of God, and anti-White news helps our White brothers and sisters to read what is within them and proclaim their right to live.</p>

<p>What they needed was more diversity. White people to do the actual work, but minorities to get the credit and the money. That is diversity.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The largest minority-owned law firm in the United States&#8221; &hellip;hmmm&hellip; both Adorno and Yoss appear to be white men. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned that makes them members of a minority, but I don&rsquo;t think the law agrees.  So who actually owns this outfit? </p>

		<p>It is well known in the litigation support business that if a &#8220;diversity&#8221; lawyer calls you with a job, you&rsquo;d best get your fee up front. </p>

<p>Actually, the idea is to pair our minority members with far east Asians; then our minority members take credit.<br>

		<p>You know, it took me the longest time (on the web) to find out why the firm got into trouble. It appears that they blocked all but their clients from collecting on the class action suit. The initial punishment was a &#8220;reprimand&#8221;, but their actions were so bad that a suspension was the outcome.</p>

<p>Too many non-whites, too much diversity kills everything from schools to neighborhoods to businesses and on and on.</p>
<p>Yes, not enough productive whites to keep the business running. Spot on.</p>

		<p>This law firm was also involved in handling foreclosures for lenders, in fact allot of the business was generated from handling foreclosures.  And many of the borrowers in foreclosure were hispanic, and or minorities&hellip;  Not sure if they are sited as one of the &#8220;foreclosure mills&#8221;, but obviously there are other issues going on here.  </p>
