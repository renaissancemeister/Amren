<h1>Democracy Dies in Scotland after Labour Hate Campaign</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BNP, March 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The hotel set to host the British National Party&rsquo;s Scottish manifesto launch has cancelled the Party&rsquo;s booking after an anti-democratic hate campaign by a Labour MP.</p>
<p>Eric Joyce, the Labour MP for Falkirk, posted instructions on his blog telling people to email the hotel&rsquo;s general manager to request that he &#8220;refuse bookings from the British National Party&#8221;.</p>
<p>One commenter on Mr Joyce&rsquo;s blog wrote that he had spread his message around on social networking sites, and another boasted of sending a &#8220;threatening email&#8221; to the hotel.</p>
<p>Eric Joyce, who was the first MP to claim more than £1 million cumulatively in parliamentary expenses, commented on the decision to cancel the event as &#8220;awesome&#8221; and &#8220;brilliant&#8221;. He also told one commenter on Twitter who respectfully questioned whether his actions were a sign of &#8220;a healthy democracy&#8221; to &#8220;grow up&#8221;.</p>
<p>British National Party Scotland Press Officer David Orr reported that Paul Bray, general manager of MacDonald Hotels&rsquo; Inchyra Grange hotel in Falkirk, where the manifesto was set to be launched, phoned him just after 5 p.m. yesterday to tell him that the event was cancelled and that the Party would no longer be welcome at the hotel.</p>
<p>Mr Bray had received phone calls threatening him with loss of future business if the conference went ahead, Mr Orr said.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the conference was booked under the name &#8220;BNP Scotland&#8221;, MacDonald Hotels posted on their Twitter page yesterday that &#8220;The hotel was not aware of the true nature of the meeting until today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gary Raikes, the Scotland Organiser for the British National Party, described the decision as &#8220;unbelievable&#8221; and &#8220;fascist&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hotel informed me a few hours earlier that they had received our cheque for rooms booked and all was well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A couple of hours later they cancel the event. Unbelievable! We cannot lie down and be treated like this. Hire cars have been booked, flights booked, rooms booked, tickets sold, a band booked, a photographer booked, manifestoes printed. This event has taken Davie Orr months to organise. The press were due to attend, with many confirming they would today. Will they report this attack on democracy by Eric Joyce the fascist, I wonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>David Orr said it was a clear case of discrimination: &#8220;If this had been a Muslim event or MOBOs or any other gathering of religion or ethnic minorities, this would result in criminal charges being brought on a &#8216;hate crime&rsquo;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The British National Party would like to assure its supporters that this autocratic behaviour by the Labour Party will not affect our Scottish Assembly election campaign. We will never give in to persecution, and we will endeavour to let the people of Scotland hear our democratic message through the hard work of our dedicated activists, in spite of any party that tries to ruthlessly stamp out oppositional views.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s show Eric Joyce and the Labour Party that the only result of their tyranny is more growth for the British National Party. Donate to our Regional Assemblies election campaign fund today, and imagine the look on his face when our donations barometer goes up because of his anti-democratic actions!<br>

		<p>Griffin&rsquo;s past is partially to blame but ultimately the BNP is doing a good job because their E.European counterparts Jobik &amp; ATAKA get at least 10% of the vote even in West-leaning Hungary &amp; Bulgaria, so native British are the real problem, they can handle a Tea Party-type movement not a Nationalist Party.</p>

		<p>If the British media give this story the attention it deserves it should garner significant sympathy and even support for the BNP. If they ignore the story, like the American media ignored the Sheraton&rsquo;s shutdown of the AmRen conference in Charlotte &hellip; well &hellip; if the BNP is worth its salt whatever doesn&rsquo;t destroy it only makes it stronger  &hellip; and the final reckoning all the more &hellip; savory.</p>

		<p>If it   were not such a serious matter, it would be almost funny to witness how these brave custodians of all virtue, decency, and righteousness do not hesitate to stoop to the sneakiest, least principled tactics in order to silence the opposition and achieve their ends&hellip; which apparently they cannot do by fair and open  public debate.</p>

		<p>Sounds familiar.</p>
<p>But in this case the left-wing politicians are entirely up-front about their aim to supress free speech.</p>

<p>Just like what they did to the Amren Conference&hellip;or any White gathering. Always a HATE crime! I sure do pray that more WHITE Brits wake up and join the BNP!.. But just like here in the good ole USA most Whites will stay asleep until it is far too late.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t these groups hire some ex-CIA or MI-5 field agent or analyst to design a &#8220;best practices&#8221; way to get around all detection?  There&rsquo;s got to be something.  I&rsquo;ll try something.  Pick a city, then set up a reservation at a fake location to fool people, then have all attendees fly to the city, then log on all at once at a designated time to get the real location in a neighboring city at a hotel under a fake reservation name (&#8220;The Annual American Midget Hemophiliac Drug Addiction and Recovery Conference&#8221;), then start the conference before the protesters have time to organize.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just throwin&rsquo; it out there.  I&rsquo;m open to any criticism and better ideas.</p>

		<p>Find out where this creep and his cohorts are planning their public events. Then phone the same venues and tell them that it&rsquo;s actually the BNP that intends to be there, and so they ought to cancel the booking or risk action from UAF.</p>

		<p>The labour party in Scotland. That bastion of free expression and equality. Don&rsquo;t forget that there are other political parties who may wish to hold venues in Scotland but obviously if these do not meet with the approval of the MP for Falkirk, he will blacklist these too. Perhaps the LibDemConservative coalition government in Westminster had better beware lest this self-opinionated left-winger bans them too. Scotland depends on the English taxpayer to the merry tune of £1,400 per annum for every scottish man. woman and child to keep that miserable country afloat whilst it gives &#8216;free&rsquo; university places and free medical care to it&rsquo;s inhabitants. They have the highest death rate in Europe from smoking and excessive drinking but the MP for Falkirk would prefer to ignore that and ban the BNP rather than banning booze and fags.   </p>

<p>Well, that at least narrows the options down to something more manageable.  So then that leaves it up to the respective members.  We all seem to be decently intelligent people who can think outside the box or talk to someone who has some experience.  Someone&rsquo;s got to know a friend or family member in the military, the police force, the FBI, a private detective, etc. that has had to deal with these issues who can share some ideas over a beer or cup of coffee.  Gees!  I can&rsquo;t be the only one pushing on this idea.</p>
