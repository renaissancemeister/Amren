<h1>Eight Out of Ten Illegal Aliens Apprehended in 2010 Never Prosecuted, Says Border Congressman</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edwin Mora, CNS News, March 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An illegal alien apprehended by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency during the last fiscal year had an estimated 84 percent chance of never being prosecuted, according to figures compiled by the office of Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas).</p>
<p>Culberson submitted the figures for the record during a hearing Wednesday of the House Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security.</p>
<p>Of 447,731 illegal aliens apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol during fiscal year 2010 (which ended last September), only 73,263 (16.4 percent) were prosecuted, according to the submitted data. That means that 374,468 illegal aliens that were taken into custody (83.6 percent) were never prosecuted.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Describing the situation during the hearing, Culberson said that those who were not prosecuted &#8220;had a chance of being home in time for dinner,&#8221; after being in custody for a few hours.</p>
<p>He asserted that criminal consequences for those involved in illegal cross-border activity was &#8220;the key&#8221; to securing the nation&rsquo;s border with Mexico.</p>
<p>The Texas Republican suggested that Operation Streamline, a program that fast-tracks prosecution and deportations of illegal immigrants crossing the border, should be applied to the entire southwest border.</p>
<p>According to CBP, the operation &#8220;targets illegal immigrants apprehended in specific enforcement zones for immediate prosecution for illegal entry. Violators face punishment of up to 180 days in jail. Additionally, deportation procedures are initiated to formally remove the individual once they complete their jail sentence.&#8221;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the plan.  The plan to destroy us and/or this country.  </p>

<p>I hope I can recognize the people responsible for this so that I can beat the hell out of them for the rest of eternity.</p>

		<p> I think that the goverment sees that the social security system will go broke without an influx of workers to shore up contributions to pay for the retirees. The thing that they are delaying is the fact that the people who today will shore it up are going to be the people who tomorrow will be recieving it. Basically they are in the same position as the inadvertant operator of a ponzi scheme. I can keep this going for awhile longer and avoid prison so I do until finally it collapses under the weight of numbers hopefully after I&rsquo;m safely retired or have fled the country.</p>

<p>And I don&rsquo;t buy the &#8220;we need illegals to shore up Social Security&#8221; bromide at all.  In fact, it&rsquo;ll actually hasten the fall of Social Security.  </p>
<p>I blogged about it quite some time ago.  Warning:  Long and accountant-ish:</p>

		<p>The problem is that ICE cares too much about public opinion than doing its job. When people who are clearly illegal are allowed to fight their deportations and get stays of deportation lasting one year or more as has been the case of many illegal immigrant students after petitions to allow the students to remain have been submitted. ICE to me represents the emperor without clothes as far as immigration is concerned.</p>
