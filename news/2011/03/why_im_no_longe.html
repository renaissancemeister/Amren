<h1>Racial Reality at 12,000 Feet</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gerald Dubose Martin, <font color="red">Special to AR News,</font> March 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s AR News posting, <a href=" /news/2011/03/sierra_club_you.php" target="sierra" style="color: fafaff; text-decoration: none"> &#8220;Sierra Club: Youthful, Diverse, Enthusiastic,&#8221;</b></a> struck a chord with me. First, I&rsquo;m an ex-&#147;Sierran,&#8221; and the pictures in the Sierra Club&rsquo;s Diversity Statement don&rsquo;t look like any Sierra Club function I ever attended. The Sierra Club is one of the least diverse organizations in the United States. It is overwhelmingly white and middle class, ranking high on any list of &#8220;Stuff White People Like.&#8221; I&rsquo;ve gone on hundreds of hikes, backpacking trips, and canoe expeditions over the past 30 years  &mdash;  most with the club  &mdash;  and I&rsquo;ve never seen more than a handful of minorities and they were mostly Asians. I have not seen even a single black in the back country, on the Continental Divide Trail at 12,000 feet, or atop one of the many hills and mountains that Sierra Club members love to climb.</p>
<p>Second, the mission of the Sierra Club, to preserve and protect the environment and especially the wild areas of the United States is Western in ethos. Organizations like the Sierra Club prosper only in the West. The diversity that the club&rsquo;s founder, John Muir, sought to defend, is the diversity in nature itself. This Diversity Statement&rsquo;s clumsy attempt to link the beautiful diversity of America&rsquo;s natural landscape to the transformation of American society into an ugly mish-mash is repugnant to anyone who truly loves the wilderness.</p>
<p>Third, just as the Sierra Club is not &#8220;diverse,&#8221; it is not &#8220;youthful,&#8221; despite the impression the pictures give. In fact, many Sierrans are openly hostile to children and refer to couples with children as &#8220;breeders&#8221; (a derogatory term invented by homosexuals to describe normal people). I once attended a Sierra Club meeting where the main speaker, an older woman, spoke about over-population. Her solution? White, middle-class people should stop having babies. Not a word about the black welfare class; not a word about the Third World.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club, like the West in general, is now suffering from this bad advice. The club&rsquo;s members are aging and are not being replaced with young people. Hence this ridiculous &#8220;outreach&#8221; program to minority youth, in the futile hope that ghetto and barrio children will, after some fun camping trips paid for by the overwhelmingly white membership, embrace the altruistic values that motivate white Sierrans to spend countless unpaid hours maintaining trails, lobbying government, and teaching others to respect the environment. Good luck.</p>
<p>Fourth, as several of the AmRen commenters noted, the Sierra Club is badly infected by political correctness. It has always maintained, correctly, that population growth is the main cause of over-development, pollution, despoliation of the environment, and loss of habitat for wild animals. But the club is no longer willing to state, as it once did, that the main cause of population growth is immigration.</p>
<p>Why? It was reported in 2004 that an open-borders fanatic named David Gelbaum who had given the club $101 million told it he would not give another dime if the Sierra Club opposed immigration. As noted above, in today&rsquo;s Sierra Club, the <em>only</em> accepted way to limit population growth is for whites to stop having children.</p>
<p>The club is so thoroughly infected with PC that it scorns the Boy Scouts, even though they share the club&rsquo;s wilderness protection ethic. This is because the scouts don&rsquo;t allow homosexual members; the club calls its sanctimonious policy &#8220;intolerance of intolerance.&#8221; Where have we heard <em>that</em> before? Anyone on a Sierra Club-sponsored trip must guard his tongue, lest he drop a sexist, racist, or homophobic remark. It will certainly be reported and the guilty party will either be &#8220;corrected&#8221; or banned from future club activities.</p>
<p>The club&rsquo;s unwillingness to talk about immigration greatly weakens its ability to defend the wilderness and the environment. America&rsquo;s population is zooming towards 400 million, with some even predicting one <em>billion</em> by 2100. This means two things that the Sierra Club refuses to face: Over-population will steadily reduce the remaining wilderness areas while Third-World newcomers will swamp the whites who have the values and altruism to defend these lands in the first place.</p>
<p>And that is why I&rsquo;m no longer a member of the Sierra Club.</p>

		<p>Sad to say, but from personal observation, blacks consistently treat the natural environment as a place to throw their litter. </p>
<p>The people who volunteer to help, who clear up, who do the unsung work, who don&rsquo;t make a fuss, they are always, always, without exception, White.</p>

		<p>I too quit the Sierra Club.  Under their &#8220;leadership&#8221; I have witnessed California transformed from paradise with 10 million people to the cancer it is today with nearly 40 million people   &mdash;   A 400% increase in population in my lifetime!</p>
<p>But wait&hellip; . it gets worse.  Due to massive uncontrolled foreign immigration into California, Whites have fled en-mass to the surrounding Western States, such that now From Washington to Montana, down to Arizona and New Mexico, all those once pristine wild areas have been turned into &#8220;miracle-mile-suburbia,&#8221; with endless track homes, fast-food restaurants, big box stores, freeways, asphalt, and chain-link fences with barb-wire.  Thanks Sierra Club   &mdash;   you have ruined the Western USA.</p>

		<p>Immigrants are not just destroying wild areas through the secondary device of adding to the population.  The illegals who cross on foot from Mexico leave copious amounts of garbage in their wake and it is one way the US Border Patrol tracks them.  There is even a hilarious miniature diarama of one of these &#8220;layups&#8221; at the wonderful Border Patrol Museum in El Paso, Texas (complete with tiny tortillas strewn about.)</p>
<p>The illigal Mexican immigrants who grow drugs in our state and national parks are even more destructive.  They set up make-shift irrigation systems to water their marijuana to the detriment of all the local flora which are obviously displaced for this cash crop on public land.  They also leave these trashed-out stinking &#8220;layups&#8221; after camping out to guard their harvest.</p>
<p>Now, regarding minorities and charity in general: we all know this is a total joke.  I have volunteered money and time to many organizations over my life and I usually only see white faces and almost never any black.  I know this to be so true that I can spot a FAKE charity from a mile away.  In my city, the City Council only grants the permit to &#8220;panhandle&#8221; to ONE organization: the firefighters who collect for children with a boot.  So when I see small groups of blacks carrying dingy buckets with some random printoff taped to these buckets begging at traffic light intersections- I call the cops every time.  And you know what?  They&rsquo;ve stopped their little scams at the corners I frequent!  </p>
<p>It makes me sick to see all the silly rubes that give them a dollar.  Is this their first day on this planet?  When else have you seen a black working for a charity that didn&rsquo;t directly benefit THEMSELVES?  Oh, never?  Well what a coincidence that they would all show up to the blatantly suspect corner operation (in ratty unmatching safety vests which one can purchase at a hardware store for $10.)  </p>
<p>I encourage everyone on this site to be aware of these scams when you see them and contact the authorities.</p>

		<p>Almost as bad as The Sierra Club is National Geographic. Neither organization has the courage to report on the destruction wrought upon the environment along the US-Mexcio border by the hordes of invaders.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t pay for Nat Geo anymore after they ran a story about the border fence and blatantly referred to it scores of times as &#8220;The Wall&#8221;. As if it were a shameful national tragedy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile here in Southern California I recently took a hike in my local national forest. Wish I had taken some pictures of all the horrible graffitti on the boulders, the human feces on the trail and all the litter. Political correctness is killing us.</p>

		<p>We always hear people with left-leaning views criticize conservatives as hateful, bigoted and intolerant. But after reading the article, it&rsquo;s so obvious that the Sierra Club is hateful, bigoted and intolerant.</p>
<p>The &#8220;hateful&#8221; things for which conservatives are criticized for are typically grounded in principle. Let&rsquo;s consider the Boy Scout&rsquo;s prohibition of openly gay scout leaders, which was mentioned in the article. I oppose gay scout leaders because statistics show that homosexual men are much more inclined to engage in child molestation than heterosexual men. Recognizing this statistic does not make me hate homosexuals any more than recognizing that black people are more likely to cause crime makes me hate blacks. I obviously know that not all homosexuals molest children and that not all black people cause crime.</p>
<p>The left-leaning world view seems to be grounded in irrational emotions. Lefties lash out on conservatives who recognize certain things that contradict their conception of equality, which they uphold like a religious sacrament. Recognizing that blacks cause more crime than whites violates their venerative view of equality, so they get angry and bitter and lash out against conservatives and call us bigots and haters. And the lefties think we&rsquo;re the intolerant ones.</p>
<p>The article also mentioned the Sierra Club members&rsquo; contemptuous hatred for white, middle class people who reproduce. Well, if these lefties don&rsquo;t want to reproduce, more power to them! I remember reading awhile back about a study; it showed that political views are partly influenced by genetics. So if the Sierra Club members actually want to make less politically like-minded individuals for future generations, that is all well and good!</p>

		<p>There is a valid point to be made here. White liberals have promoted zero population growth (ZPG), respect for the environment, and ecological balance for some decades. And certainly have done so at the expense of their more conservative rivals&rsquo; interests, if we look at such things as pollution control and environmental regulations. Yet all of the environmental agenda is going out the window in order to accommodate multicultistism. </p>
<p>It seems as if environmentalists make very good attack dogs when it comes to taking on conservatives and business, but they roll over and play dead when it comes to illegal aliens and such. Please note how much of the frontier zone between the USA and Mexico has been trashed by illegal immigrants, coyotes, and smugglers of all varieties. </p>
<p>As for ZPG, many of America&rsquo;s cities are being overloaded, especially when it comes to demands for services, schools and infrastructure. </p>
<p>The other side of this is that ZPG would inevitably lead to an aging populace, at least of White people who buy into limiting their numbers. The mass migrations of third world peoples into America becomes just as inevitable, given the way that demographic pressures work, and the need for younger people to do much of the grunt work.</p>
<p>Regardless, this entire episode is one more element of the downward spiral. </p>

		<p>With the exception of certain activities like hunting, fur trapping and fishing, mining and forestry, outdoor recreationists have been politically left of center for a long time.</p>
<p>The natural environment stirs emotion, gives solace and can be kind of spiritual. Because these experiences are emotionally based, it&rsquo;s not difficult to figure out why there&rsquo;s rampant liberalism in organizations like the Sierra Club. People who consider themselves liberals, or sensitive types, think primarily with their feelings as opposed to logic, deductive reasoning or evidence. </p>
<p>I figured this out long ago in the 80&rsquo;s. It has become much worse since. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Who had given the club 101 million&#8221; I don`t get it. What the power this guy has&hellip; He already GAVE the money so why are they worried about getting more? Or more correctly, what leverage to make policy does he have after donating. It`s like those art museums who sell off someones prized collection to get something new they want more. I don`t see why the club doesn`t accept the cash and then do what they want anyway. <br>
  As for the boy scouts, I never was one or wanted to be. But I`ve always been in their cultural corner. Especially after I saw a late 1930`s movie news reel that showed them evacuating 95 year old men in blankets, one scout to a corner. At first I thought a nursing home or something had caught fire. Then I realized that they were the muscle being used to put Gettysburg 75th veterans back in the field for the final roll call. They showed one over 100 yr. old Reb colonel being surrounded by 12 year old scouts and fifty year old town folk. It was so Ike and his paratroops I could spit. Outstanding!!</p>

		<p>I had been a Boy Scout in the 1960s, my sisters  Girl Scouts.  Both my parents were very involved.  We all grew up loving the outdoors, and &#8220;camped out&#8221; every chance we could, with or without Scouting. In the 1980s I received training, and volunteered, for Boy Scout adult leadership for a district that was slowly going from white to black.  (It&rsquo;s mostly black now.)  The district and troop leaders, committee members, were almost all white, as were about half the kids.  We had trouble getting black adults involved, and even the kids lost interest after a year or two.  The white kids and parents were the most involved, and, as the neighborhood demographics changed, the district disappeared.  This is not the same as the Sierra Club, but I relate it because my experience is that it is only whites that truly have interest in, and care about, the outdoors and the environment.  It&rsquo;s pretty sad because the inner-city kids could have gotten something from Scouting that they never would have otherwise from their own families or communities.</p>

		<p>As I stated in a previous post, if you were to ask a Sierra Club White Liberal if they would be gushing with great joy if Native Born White Americans started having large families-like they did in the past-the Sierra Club White Liberal would tell you emphatically no. Sierra Club White Liberals don&rsquo;t like Native Born White American generated popultion growth&hellip;but they are very enthusiastic about post-1965 high fertility nonwhite generated population growth. In other words, Sierra Club White Liberals could give a hoot about protecting wilderness areas,endangered species and ecosystems. What they want is the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority-even if it means the complete destruction of wilderenss areas,endangered species and ecosystems of America.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are being severely punished by Sierra Club Whie Liberals and other phony environmentalists-even though Native Born White Americans did the right thing suposedly for the environment by dropping their fertility level to replacement level starting in 1971. Therefore, what is the incentive, what is the point of doing the right for the environmnet if it means being punished by the phony White Liberal environmentalists? Native Born White Americans should just live it up and the heck with the environment. I could care less about saving the environment for the Asian,Muslim,Hindu,Mexican and African genelines in &#8220;America&#8221;. The point of this line of thought is to highlight the complete insanity of White Liberal Sierra Club members.</p>
<p>One last point, if large numbers of Asians and other post-1965 nonwhites joined the Sierra Club all of sudden it would still be full-speed ahead with the &#8220;argument&#8221; that protection of the environment requires a legal immigration policy that  maximizes racial diversity, and at the same time, reduces the Native Born White Majority to an ever dwindling racial  minority within the borders of America&hellip;and as we now know from the recent incident at UCLA involving a defenseless Native Born White American Teenager..we will be viciously persecuted by the Asian &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; in the nonwhite Sierra Club of the future.</p>

		<p>I used to backpack in California a great deal.  I never joined the Sierra Club because in the 1980s they were becoming elitist snobs, engaged in internal power struggles.  Today, they&rsquo;re merely accepting the inevitable and hoping against hope that non-whites will care about nature the way they did.  Most whites never did care all that much anyway, especially Republicans, who fought every move to conserve national treasures through expanding state parks and the creation of wilderness areas.</p>
<p>ZPG had a good message.  The problem was that only educated whites understood it.  I think that the Japanese understood it as well.  It is too late now anyway.  Whites can survive by trying to out breed the rest of the world and few whites can afford to have any children at all.  I really don&rsquo;t think that any movement other than nature will correct the human population problem. One thing we can count on is that it will, and soon.</p>

		<p>You know, people are criticizing black and brown for not getting involved in the Boy Scouts and the Sierra Club but what about yellow? <br>
Asians have committed appalling atrocities against the environment and right now China is destroying itself with sweat shop pollution. I also needn&rsquo;t remind you of all the barbarous things various Asian groups do to animals for food and for bizarre &#8220;cultural&#8221; woo woo and superstition.</p>
<p>I bet there ain&rsquo;t a whole lot of yellow at the good &#8216;ol Sierra Club. If there isn&rsquo;t a money, food, power or superstition payoff Asians don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p>And not about poor whites or rich whites either.  Only middle class whites should stop reproducing according to this dingbat.</p>

Kingoldby:<br>
You are 1000% correct. A few years ago our city built a beautiful park in the &#8220;minority&#8221; part of our town. This park is perhaps 100 acres in size and has all the typical playground equipment, swimming pool, shelters, etc. However, it has one unique feature, it is bordered on two sides by a huge beaver pond and stunning tupelo gum swamp. Tupelo gum trees grow in deeper water than cypress and have immense trunks up to 8-feet in diameter at the base. They taper upwards like giant Hersey&rsquo;s Kisses. When the park first opened we visited there and observed beavers, an otter family, scores of wild ducks, egrets, cranes and hundreds of other birds.</p>
<p>Sadly that was when the park opened. NOW the beaver pond has become a dump for old tires and household garbage. The city had to barricade access to the pond and swamp because of drug dealing, in fact all areas of the park not observable from the street are now closed so police can get a quick overview as they drive by. I still go out there to birdwatch, but there is almost never a black in sight. If there is, you really should leave or at least roll up your windows and lock the doors.</p>

		<p>Personally I&rsquo;ve always been a huge skeptic of &#8220;overpopulation&#8221; or &#8220;over-consumption&#8221;.  From the beginning of time until recently, each doubling of the population has produced a quadrupling of the GDP, resulting in about twice as much stuff for everybody. (&#8220;stuff&#8221; includings things like national parks and free time). With 7 billion people on the planet, we are better fed than ever. This can be understood from economic theory: Each doubling allows for greater specialization and mass production techniques. A contraction of the world&rsquo;s population would probably lead to technological stagnation and decline. I believe the planet could support trillions of people, and such a world would be &#8220;greener&#8221; than it is now. Granted, we&rsquo;d have to artificially produce our food at food factories powered by fusion reactors.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t that the world is overpopulated but that the wrong people are having the most children. This can be explained by evolutionary theory: Brains consume energy, reproduction consumes energy, therefor people with big brains will reproduce at a slower rate than less gifted ones unless we suppress the sexuality of the least fit. And it will happen much faster then we realize: scientists can change the personality of a breed of rats in just 7 generations of selective breeding.</p>
<p>Group, mean IQ, births per female<br>
Asian, 105    , 1.0 (Hong Kong) to 1.7 (China), mean 1.4<br>
White, 100    , 1.2 (Spain, Italy) to 2.4 (Argentina), mean 1.5<br>
Hispanic,  90 , ~2.4 <br>
Arab,    90,  , 1.9 to 8 (Yemen I believe?) (mean 2.4)<br>

		<p>Sometimes people who favor population reduction try to use the black death &#8216;benefiting&rsquo; Europe as an example of why we should do so. </p>
<p>So, as a afterthought to my previous post, I would like to point out that I don&rsquo;t believe the black death benefited Europe. It was the capitalistic policies implemented in response to the black death that made Europe rich. History is full of disease epidemics and no other instance has ever resulted in society getting richer. If Europe had tried to deal with the black death by saying &#8220;Gee, we need to import 45 million Africans to replace the people who died&#8221; history would have been different.</p>

		<p>I have friends in the Green party and sierra club, or I used to until I became interesed in less immigration. The answer i get from the Green party and sierra club, is the reason they are not going to go against massive immigration is because they blame all the immigration on foreign policy by the USA that causes bad economies in foreign countries which makes them need to come here. <br>
 So massive immigration is to somehow punish those in power in the USA that make foreign policy like NAFTA, etc.</p>
<p>What they can not answer is how is massive hurting the ruling class making foreign policy, from where i sit the ruling class wants more immigration so the sierra club and gree party lefties are just tools.<br>
I hopem everyone in this site is also a member of numbersusa and sees what their weasels in washingtoon immigration voting records are.</p>
<p>Currently, the 2012 candidadte with the best immigration voting record is pawlenty.<br>

		<p>There were court challenges to the policies of the Boy Scouts of America requiring only heterosexuals and professed Christians which failed.</p>
<p>An alternative to BSA was Scouting For All: </p>

<p>Nothing seems to have happened with this gay, atheist, agnostic friendly group. I don&rsquo;t know of any active chapters and I can&rsquo;t find information on membership numbers.</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicions that the organization exists only as a anemic counter to the BSA. I believe they have few, if any, members and is a lifeless entity that maintains a board of trustees just to pretend there is a viable alternative to the scouts.</p>
<p>Really, what heterosexual parents would actively encourage or support their son&rsquo;s participation in a group which promotes and encourages gay men and boys as members? </p>
<p>I doubt even uber-liberal parents would speak proudly of their childrens participation and I doubt heterosexual boys would want to be associated with this group. </p>

		<p>I too left the Sierra Club years ago, shortly after a slate of pro population stabilization, pro immigration reduction candidates for the board of directors were subjected to a smear campaign by the sitting members of the Sierra Club board.  (In that campaign they actually ran Morris Dees as a fake candidate for the board in order to draw votes away from the pro immigration reduction candidates.)</p>
<p>As I recall one of the directors has called the ACLU a &#8220;sister organization&#8221; of the Sierra Club.  That&rsquo;s the same ACLU that sues any state or municipality that tries to enforce immigration law.<br>

<p>In 1990 Gelbaum bought two ranches in Arizona and hypocritically stated: <i> I came to Arizona and I wanted to be good to the land and good to the people.</i></p>
<p>Meanwhile, along the Arizona border,  The Sierra Club has filed suit against a border fence <i>Despite the terrible destruction to habitat and mountains of trash left by illegal alien crossers</i></p>
<p><i>Each illegal immigrant leaves an average of eight pounds of trash   &mdash;   totaling six tons a day. There are an estimated 5,000 backpacks in a ravine along with countless water containers, food wrappers, clothing, feces, thousands of soiled baby diapers, empty sardine cans, discarded clothing and sheets of used toilet paper hang from bushes alongside desert trails.  At the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, once a pristine backcountry, illegal immigrants have trampled, snapped and burned plants and worn wide footpaths in the ground.</i></p>
<p><i>On the Tohono O&rsquo;odham reservation, human waste that contaminated hand-dug wells in one village forced the tribe to truck in water&hellip; diseases most frequently associated with exposure to human waste are hepatitis A and giardiasis, a parasitic intestinal infection.</i></p>

<p><i>&#8216;I cannot support an organization that is anti-immigration. It would dishonor the memory of my grandparents.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>The Sierra Club has morphed from an organization dedicated to protecting and preserving America&rsquo;s natural wonders and limiting population growth into a leftist, eco-marxist globalist religion driven by money.</p>
<p>If that isn&rsquo;t enough to get you drop your membership or stop donating to the Sierra Club, maybe this will:  <i>The Sierra Club has financially supported factually challenged filmmaker Michael Moore in his get-out-the-vote tour of college campuses.</i></p>

		<p> The whites will preserve and protect the environment in America. Go to any campground in the country and you will see all whites just about anywhere. Visiting Yellowstone last summer I saw no Latino visitors, all Asians I heard speaking were foreigners and also many white Europeans were enjoying the natural beauty. In about a week at Yellowstone I saw around twenty blacks at the Park. I thought it was a very interesting demographic to show which race is devoted to preserving nature.</p>

		<p>The Sierra Club is responsible for a lot of the air pollution in this country by stopping the construction of nuclear power plants in the US. Instead the electric power industry built many coal fired plants and caused much acid rain and air pollution. With the crisis in Japan, the world is having a knee jerk reaction of anti nuclear sentiment, but nuclear power is the only viable solution to the ever increasing demand for power in America. Renewable solar and wind power will not meet the demands for power, it just can&rsquo;t happen. Nuclear is the only solution for the energy problem in America and the white liberal anti-nuclear bomb/anti-nuclear power Sierra Club has stopped nuclear power that is needed in much of the US.</p>

		<p>Traditionally, nature conservation has been part of &#8220;Left of centre&#8221; politics. Then back in the 1970s we had the begining of Green politics and associated extreme environmental protection policies.Yes, here in Oz there were some spectacular protests against logging, dam construction and whaling. With a very competent and openly homosexual leader, the far left Green party has become the very authoritive 3rd voice in Australian politics.</p>
<p>But what do the Greens stand for? EVERYTHING THAT IS NOW DESTROYING AMERICA! Including extreme PC, AA &amp; diversity. They would also tax every farm, forest, mine and industry out of existence. They have a totally open door immigration policy, support homosexual marriage and want free welfare for everyone. They would lock up national parks and give them back to the Aboriginals.</p>
<p>As a person who loves the Great Outdoors I can certainly not identify with the Greens. Likewise I can understand the writer&rsquo;s frustration with the Sierra Club. </p>

		<p>If preserving the environment is the prime purpose of the Sierra Club, why don&rsquo;t they rise up, en masse, and denounce the illegals who care nothing for our beautiful land? Perhaps that is the only way we have to fight back against the invaders. Have teachers who have to manage classrooms filled with non-English speaking students who refuse to follow the rules, hospitals who are going broke because of non-payment, unemployed Americans who see jobs going to lawbreakers. There are so many ills brought about by illegal immigration, that a huge, mighty voice is needed from the rest of America, because it certainly isn&rsquo;t coming from Washington.</p>

		<p>Here are a few more things to think about. The Sierra Club is in favor of amnesty. If amnesty is given to millions of post-1965 high fertility nonwhite illegal immigrants, it would set into motion the most rapid increase of a human population in some region of the planet in the history of the human race. Once legalized, these former illegal aliens and their racial kin already in &#8220;America&#8221; would have full control of &#8220;US&#8221; immigration policy&hellip;and as a consequence, it will be open borders-all day and all night. The &#8220;US&#8221; population would explode to one billion in 25 years or less. Not only that, there would be massive demographic momentum built into the population structure of the &#8220;US&#8221; population..thereby, gauranteeing a population size that will exceed China and India. This, of course, will lead to the ecological collapse of &#8220;America&#8221;. The Native Born White American  population will never survive this. Without a  doubt, the Native Born White American population is largely oblivious to the catastrophe that-with high probability-awaits them in the future. As Peter Brimelow has written recently:&#8221;it will all end in tears&#8221;. Secession will not prevent the ecological collpase of &#8220;America&#8221;. </p>
<p>High fertility post-1965 nonwhites are waging a vicious demograpahic war of aggression against the Native Born White Majority..and this vicious demographic war of aggression has the full approval of the White Liberal phony environmentalist over at the Sierra Club and the other major environmental organizations in DC who are on the take from the hedge funds and the mega-corporations. </p>
<p>What I have just written here is exactly what Native Born White American Patriots should be saying to our fellow Native Born White Americans..and don&rsquo;t   forget to mention the  legal Chinese immigrants and how they introduced  the ecologically destabilizing giant snakehead fish from Asian into America&rsquo;s River System.</p>

		<p>Any liberal organization will always tout the party line, regardless of how much it contradicts the objectives of the group.  But, regardless of how non-whites thwart such objectives, they are excused.  Blacks and browns are not expected to uphold environmental or legal standards.  Moslems and fundamentalist black Christians are never criticized for their religiosity.  Basically, the left treats these groups like children who cannot be expected to uphold adult standards of behavior  &mdash;  a most racist and ethnocentric worldview.</p>

		<p>Same in England. For decades, English families have spent many happy days walking and hiking in our National Parks. As teenage boys, we would go weekend camping with a backpack, a pup-tent, map and compass and heating cans of baked beans then cooking sausages and strips of bacon on sticks over an open fire. Then the multi-cults noticed that no black, indians or pakistani people ever took part. These left wing idiots claimed this was obviously because of our White racist attitude!! Leaflets were printed in urdu and other sqiggles extolling the virtues of the countryside and open air exercise. No response, even to organised group activities for these miserable immigrants. Eventually the truth came out. Indians thought it was stupid as they had houses to live in and only refugees used tents. They are so worried about what their high-caste neighbours would think. As to cooking sausages outdoors&hellip;they could not see the fun in this as their parents cooked perfectly good curry at home! Pakistani families were amazed that anyone would walk along country trails unless they were avoiding monsoon floods and asked if White families had cars! Blacks were interested in White teenage girls who belonged to hiking clubs but only wanted to meet them at club premises and demanded loud caribbean drum music and that we provided free beer and chicken jerk indoors. Blacks apparently don&rsquo;t like walking anywhere, paying for anything or going out on sunny days!l As far as I am aware, the idea simply fell apart although hiking trails still have information boards and maps in languages nobody uses.</p>

		<p>In Victor Hanson&rsquo;s article &#8220;Two Californias&#8221; he writes about how the Southwestern portion of California&rsquo;s Fresno County, is inhabited now by virtually all Mexicans. The dumping of trash along roadsides is endemic in this once beautiful area. &#8220;There are mounds of trash, half-empty paint cans, disposable diapers, and moldy food.&#8221; For all intents and purposes the illegals living in this area have created numerous toxic landfills on whichever public or private property they feel like dumping it. The Sierra Club totally ignores these toxic waste lands as do the county health inspectors from the nearby liberal dominated California cities. I have come to the conclusion that groups like the Sierra Club could care less about the environment. Sadly, these organizations have bought into the myth of a multi-cultural environmental utopia, in which whites have no place. As the number of whites decline, so too will the environment.</p>

<p>According to numbersusa.com:</p>
<p>Tim Pawlenty: C+</p>
<p><i>Pawlenty said. &#8216;We celebrate and welcome immigration. &hellip; But the system needs to be legal and reasonable and orderly and that is not what we have now.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Is this what we want?  More immigration?  I don&rsquo;t know about you but I welcome NO immigration legal or otherwise with one single exception:  White South Africans fleeing genocide from their black overlords.</p>
<p>He should have said:  &#8220;As 15-20 million US Citizens are un- or under- employed, I will fight for an immediate end to all immigration and refugee programs, legal and illegal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pawlenty also said this:</p>
<p><i>One of the founding principles of this country is the rule of law.. Deportation should depend on factors such as how long the illegal has been in the country.</i></p>
<p>Trying to play both sides, aren&rsquo;t you Tim?  He should have said:  </p>
<p> &#8220;Illegal entry into the US is a violation of US Law. Any illegal alien caught on US soil will be deported immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>And:  </p>
<p><i> Pawlenty lobbied Congress to increase the number of H-1B visas in 2006 before the recession.</i> <br>
 <br>
And yes, there is some good mixed with the bad:</p>
<p><i>On January 7, 2008, Gov. Pawlenty signed an executive order directing the Minnesota State Police to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and participate in the 287(g) program and he signed an executive order preventing any locality in Minnesota from being a &#8216;sanctuary city.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to ask Pawlenty about the refugees that continue to pour into his state, 59,878 as of 2005, mostly from Somalia, Burundi, Burma, Cambodia,  Ethiopia, Laos.  </p>
<p>How does bringing in dirt-poor, uneducated, violent non-Whites  help the people of your state, Tim?  As a tax-paying citizen I highly resent the refugee industry.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell everyone you know about Pawlenty&rsquo;s record, especially those in Minnesota who deserve to know what their politicians are up to.</p>

and scroll half way down you will find a book review of a fascinating book entitled, The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution, and written by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. The authors contend that the black propensity to litter can be explained in terms of the fact that they more recently emerged from a hunter gatherer existence than whites. <br>
 <br>
Paleolithic hunters were always on the move, so they had little incentive to bury the remains of the animals they killed. Farmers, even neolithic farmers, learned that if they did not dispose of the remains of animals they butchered they might get sick from bacteria attracted to those remains.<br>
 <br>
The 10,000 Year Explosion also explains why blacks have higher rates of crime than whites and East Asians, and lower IQs, and why Australian aborigines have even higher rates of crime and even lower IQs. <br>
 <br>
The 10,000 Year Explosion is a valuable supplement to The Bell Curve. The Bell Curve documents and describes racial differences. The 10,000 Year Explosion explains why they evolved.   </p>

		<p>As much there is a serious environmental problem with overpopulation, I would much rather that there be population explosion of middle-class white people, than blacks, Asians, or even poor whites.</p>
<p>This is because middle-class whites and a number of upper class white people are the best kind of environmentalists.  The white nations of Europe, and even the USA, with a still-majority white population, are far more advanced when it comes to dealing with environmental problems than the Latin America, the black African nations, and most certainly the Asian nations of China, Thailand, etc.</p>

<p>Grim, but true.</p>
<p>We have policies in the Western world which are essentially dysgenic. High-IQ people do not reproduce enough. Low IQ people expand their numbers with mindless reproduction. All this is encouraged by open borders, allowing the exploding third world populaces to move into the first world. And by domestic polices such as affirmative action and the welfare state which push the lower IQ higher up the social ladder at the expense of the more intelligent. Consider the reports of science classes being cut to make room for remedial education. </p>
<p><i>A contraction of the world&rsquo;s population would probably lead to technological stagnation and decline. </i></p>
<p>And this is what we are seeing in the USA. We are importing too much of our technology, and scientists/IT personnel. Infrastructure is disintegrating, industy downsized, education a shambles, well, we all know the drill. </p>
