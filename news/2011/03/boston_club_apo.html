<h1>Boston Club Apologizes for Alleged Racism</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Max de La Bruyere and James Lu, Yale Daily News, Feb. 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Cure Lounge, the Boston nightclub accused by patrons of racism for shutting down a black alumni party the weekend of the Harvard-Yale football game, issued a public apology and agreed to pay a $30,000 fine Friday.</p>
<p>The club will also have its employees undergo annual anti-discrimination training as part of a judgment by the Massachusetts Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, Attorney General Martha Coakley announced Friday. The consent judgment ends lawsuits against the club&rsquo;s owner, Paige Hospitality Inc., alleging the club&rsquo;s actions violated public accommodations and consumer protection laws. Those lawsuits followed claims by the event&rsquo;s organizers, three Harvard graduate students, that the club&rsquo;s management cited concerns about &#8220;local gangbangers&#8221; and the &#8220;wrong crowd&#8221; in closing the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Massachusetts businesses cannot refuse to host events because of racial reasons,&#8221; Coakley said. &#8220;In this case, club staff made harmful and ill-conceived conclusions based on the simple fact that most of the guests were black.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At the event, staff refused to admit guests who did not present Harvard or Yale identification, though party organizers pointed out that most of the 400 guests would be alumni and thus without school IDs, according to an e-mail by party organizer and Harvard Business School student Michael Beal. Fearing disruptive activity, the club then asked those it had already admitted to leave around 11:00 p.m., he added.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Cure Lounge issued a public apology that will remain on its website for 30 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cure Lounge does not tolerate racism,&#8221; the statement reads. &#8220;And will do everything in its power to ensure that the events of November 20 will not be repeated.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The club also apologized for statements made on its behalf by George Regan Jr., the chairman of Boston public relations firm Regan Communications Group, after the event.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a November interview with the News, Regan said the party was shut down because of &#8220;bad people,&#8221; and &#8220;professional wise-guys [who] couldn&rsquo;t spell the words &#8216;Harvard&rsquo; or &#8216;Yale&rsquo; &hellip; who cause trouble,&#8221; and not because of the color of the guests&rsquo; skin.</p>

		<p>If you think of in the grand scheme of things $30K is cheap.<br>
How much would it cost in broken furniture, a harrassed staff and extra security? Then theres the crimes and violence that would have occured to patrons, staff and anyone just walking by this event, how nuch is a life worth these days? $30K sounds cheap to me.</p>

		<p> &ldquo;professional wise-guys [who] couldn&rsquo;t spell the words &lsquo;Harvard&rsquo; or &lsquo;Yale&rsquo;&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>LOL! That&rsquo;s so insightfully on-target.</p>
<p>What really stands out, though, is this mandatory &#8220;annual anti-discrimination training&#8221; nonsense. Who in the world  &mdash;  black or white  &mdash;  could conduct such a session anymore with a straight face?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard enough for me, as an educator, to have to use texts and materials that portray just about every bad guy as a white male and every positive role model or authority figure as a black. My students, and everybody else, KNOW it&rsquo;s 180 degrees opposite reality, yet somehow we all play along.</p>
<p>Instructing business owners on how not to be wary of obvious thugs entering their establishments and ruining things for everybody if not outrightly endangering public safety though&hellip; I think I&rsquo;d just have a meltdown like that Angry Man newscaster in &#8220;Network.&#8221;</p>

Last summer, a downtown bar hosted a party for 200 blacks. 8 people were shot. 4 died. No witnesses.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s basically a $30K black-avoidance tax. </p>
<p>I think it has reached the point where just about everyone knows how bogus the whole thing is. In a way, whites are fighting back in a passive-aggressive manner. It&rsquo;s a start.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, okay, we simply, at this point, do not want your kind. So until things change, we&rsquo;ll just go ahead and pay the fine and say whatever nonsense you want us to say and admit how sorry we are and blah, blah, blah. But guess what, no blacks. </p>

		<p>In most places, the long-term result of this court decision will be a decision by such clubs not to book parties for blacks, even if they are the cream of the crop of black society.  As long as the club doesn&rsquo;t cite a race-related reason, it&rsquo;s not breaking any laws.  </p>

<p>No, Martha, the club staff made sane and well-founded  conclusions based on decades of empirical evidence showing that black gatherings almost always end in rioting or shootings and destruction of property without anyone ever being held accountable.</p>
<p>You are still angry about losing to Scott Brown, aren&rsquo;t you Martha, and you are lashing out at those who &#8220;dissed&#8221; you.  You lost because of your own stupidity  and shrew-like manner.  Your pandering didn&rsquo;t work during the election and it won&rsquo;t here.  </p>

<p>You are absolutely right about that.  </p>
<p>But in this  specific case, there was no pre-judgement involved.  The event was already underway. The guests were asked to leave based on their actual obnoxious behavior. This was not a matter of speculation in advance, but of demonstrated fact. Nobody was pre-judging anybody.</p>

		<p>Exactly right about the word &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; as it means one is judging based on past experiences.  We all &#8216;prejudge&rsquo; and it is not always a negative connotation.  Every time I eat at a certain fast food place and it makes me sick, I am &#8216;prejudice&rsquo; in that I will not eat there again based on past experience, for example.  </p>

		<p>I just HAPPENED to be in Las Vegas the weekend they hosted the NBA All Star game.  I boarded the plane in Detroit for Vegas and I swear I think my wife and I were the only two none blacks on the plane.  I was going to a business convention and no idea the NBA All Start game was going on.  </p>
<p>Well, long story short.  The blacks tore the town down.  One white bar bouncer was shot by &#8220;gang banger&#8221; in the spine and paralyzed for life.  Fist fights at the airport ticket counter, countless acts of violence reported all over the city.  I saw it all on the news and in the Vegas papers.  At the end of the weekend, I read a lengthy story in the papers and the &#8220;gang bangers&#8221; were the root cause of it all&hellip;..according to reports.   The Vegas mayor said they will never host an NBA All Star game again. <br>
