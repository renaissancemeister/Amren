			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Tony Paterson, Independent (London), March 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel&rsquo;s newly appointed Interior Minister has reignited an already-heated immigration debate by insisting that Islam &#8220;does not belong&#8221; in Germany  &mdash;  a country with a resident population of four million Muslims.</p>
<p>Hans-Peter Friedrich took office only last week in a cabinet reshuffle, but his outspoken views have provoked instant condemnation from opposition MPs and a vitriolic response from Islamic groups which have branded them a &#8220;slap in the face for all Muslims&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;To say that Islam belongs in Germany is not a fact supported by history&#8221;, Mr Friedrich said. At the weekend, he underlined his position, insisting that immigrants ought to be aware of their host country&rsquo;s &#8220;Western Christian origins&#8221; and learn German &#8220;first and foremost&#8221;.</p>
<p>His views flatly contradicted those of Germany&rsquo;s conservative President, Christian Wulff, who, in an attempt to defuse an increasingly bitter integration row, proclaimed in a keynote speech last year that Islam &#8220;belongs to Germany&#8221; precisely because of its large Muslim population.</p>
<p>Mr Friedrich, who belongs to the Bavarian wing of Ms Merkel&rsquo;s ruling Christian Democrats, a group known for its opposition to Muslim immigration, insisted in a speech on Saturday that his stance was meant to bring &#8220;society together and not polarise it&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said he looked forward to discussing his position with Germany&rsquo;s predominantly Turkish Muslims at a government-sponsored Islamic conference at the end of the month. The minister was appointed a day after Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, Germany&rsquo;s popular Defence Minister, was forced to resign over a scandal in which he was found to have plagiarised large sections of his university doctorate.</p>
<p>In an attempt to minimise the damage, Chancellor Merkel quickly reshuffled her cabinet, giving Thomas de Maizière, her trusted Interior Minister, the Defence Minister&rsquo;s job and importing Mr Friedrich to take over the Interior Ministry. Although his Bavarian conservatives have already called for a halt to Muslim immigration, few expected the new Interior Minister to spark controversy so quickly.</p>
<p>Lamya Kaddor, the chairman of Germany&rsquo;s liberal Islamic Foundation, described his remarks as a &#8220;slap in the face for all Muslims&#8221;.</p>
<p>Insisting that Mr Friedrich was politically and historically wrong, she said his comments were &#8220;dangerous&#8221; as they threatened to undermine dialogue with Muslim groups.</p>
<p>Mr Friedrich&rsquo;s remarks have been angrily criticised by opposition Social Democrats, Greens and several leading members of Ms Merkel&rsquo;s liberal Free Democrat coalition partners. &#8220;Islam has been a real part of Germany for several generations now; it is unhelpful to deny this fact,&#8221; Hartfrid Wolff, a liberal MP, complained.</p>
<p>The row is the latest episode of a long-running debate about immigration, integration and assimilation, which erupted last autumn following publication of an inflammatory book entitled Deutschland schafft sich ab (&#8220;Germany is doing away with itself&#8221;) by Thilo Sarrazin, a former Federal Bank board member, who resigned his post following the furore his book caused.</p>
<p>Mr Sarrazin argues that Germans will soon be outnumbered by an underclass of semi-criminal Muslim immigrants, who have too many children, speak little or no German and depend on welfare payments to survive. His book has sold some 1.3 million copies, making it one of the biggest-selling titles in post-war Germany.</p>
<p>The debate has provoked headlines for months, yet it has so far been dominated by politicians, with German Muslim representatives taking only a back seat.</p>
<p>Last year, Ms Merkel proclaimed that attempts to build a multicultural society had &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;. Her views were echoed by David Cameron in a speech he made in Germany last month.</p>
<p>Mr Friedrich&rsquo;s remarks were a clear sign that the hardline stance on integration taken by Ms Merkel&rsquo;s conservatives is becoming more strident.</p>

		<p>The real Germans are coming out of the shadows at last.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t remember history, back in the post-war 1920&rsquo;s the Bavarian nationalists with their Freikorps veteran army had to hand the German communist revolutionaries a resounding defeat.</p>
<p>The red Germans under politicians like Merkel have been running Germany too long.  </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a breath of fresh air to see at least a tiny spark of sanity guttering in Germany.  Which will prove stronger, the Germans&rsquo; long-slumbering pride and good sense, or the icy-cold terror of being called Racists?<br>

With all the Muslim nations in the world, there is no reason for a Muslim to move to a non-Muslim nation (unless they have ulterior motives).</p>

<p>Such an assinine statement to make.  Only an airhead leftist radical would believe such tripe.</p>
<p>Germany should respond by having their own day of rage and toss the demagogue out of the country.<br>

Last year, Ms. Merkel proclaimed that attempts to build a multicultural society had &ldquo;utterly failed&rdquo;.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Ahhhh, the key weakness of liberal socialists becomes obvious, do you see it?  To maintain &#8216;dialogue&rsquo; (so that they can later dominate it) they yield ground, trying to keep themselves aligned as closely to the mid-stream of popular zeitgeist as they can.</p>
<p>Yet once they have been caught doing this, they lose forever the grim harridan moral righteousness by which they -insist- that you give ground before their &#8216;more balanced&rsquo; ideas.  Power appeals more than ideals in a politician as opposed to a statesman and once they cede what they never really believed of the latter, the former vanishes as a license to browbeat and intimidate those who merely want to hold onto what is their&rsquo;s to own.</p>
<p>Islam is not a German gestalt.</p>
<p>Islam is the product of a man who was a crazed epileptic.  Islam is the product of genocide of a judeo-christian society in Arabia which continues to this day.  Islam rose to power when a mere man told an envious underclass that it was -good- to pillage, rape and murder those whose only crime was having more than they did.</p>
<p>Provided they gave him -him- a cut.</p>
<p>This was the attitude of a man who failed in every way in life UNTIL he advocated LCD violence to the dumbest of the dumb.  </p>
<p>This was a man very much like Hitler.</p>
<p>Like Hitler this was a man &#8216;in love&rsquo; with much younger women (a pedophile in fact).  A man who adopted the attitudes of the moment as the ways of Christianity until it got him ignored and he changed his spots accordingly.  Like Hitler who advocated revolution until loyalty to the establishment got him real power.</p>
<p>A man who used torture and a hatred of Jews to get what he really wanted: wealth and power (starting a fire on a man&rsquo;s chest to get him to reveal his family treasure&rsquo;s location and then killing him anyway, to have his wife too.).  Like Hitler demonized and then ostracized Jews to nationalize their property within his sole party.</p>
<p>A man whose &#8216;wisdom&rsquo; was accompanied by fits of paranoid delusion that many have labelled a likely indicator of congenital disease.  Like Hitler, whose later delusions were put down to syphillis contracted in his wandering days as a homeless artiste`.</p>
<p>A man who was in fact a total illiterate yet whose &#8216;wisdom&rsquo; was recorded by others exploiting his name, two centuries after he was dead.</p>
<p>This was Mohammed.  In so many ways, this was also Hitler.</p>
<p>Islam does not &#8216;belong&rsquo; IN Germany.  It must not.  Ever.  Your nation has been brutalized enough by rampant evil.  Fight it.  </p>
<p>Fight it hard.</p>

		<p>So Merkel says multiculturalism is a failure.</p>
<p>The Interior Minister says Islam does not belong in Germany.</p>
<p>Hey, I agree with both of you.  But now what?  Are you going to make another edgy statement to the media in three months again or are you going to put words to action and do something about it?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be impressed once you start DOING something about your overt problem.</p>

		<p>A CSU interior minister is going to be amusing.<br>
Formally, the CDU (Christian Democratic Union) of Merkel and the timidly hinted at &#8220;Bavarian wing&#8221; i.e. the CSU (Christian Social Union; though they are anything but socialist) are one party.<br>
However the CSU is the party of the late great F. J. Strauss (usually fondly referred to as &#8220;Ayatollah Franz Josef&#8221;) who ruled Bavaria for decades as if it was independent (and indeed there are still some &#8220;Freistaat&#8221; statutes left).<br>
- CSU voters are the stock Ludwig der Bayer led to break the Second Turkish Siege of Vienna (1683) (contrary to what our children are taught, Jan Sobieski with the Polish cavalry arrived late; and very probably on purpose).</p>
<p>Well, maybe there´s hope :)<br>

		<p>The German minister is correct - Islam DOES NOT belong in Germany, it doesn&rsquo;t belong in France, it doesn&rsquo;t belong in the Netherlands, it doesn&rsquo;t belong in Britain   &mdash;   and it sure as h*** doesn&rsquo;t belong in the U.S.A.!!!  Islam belongs in the Middle East   &mdash;   and ONLY in the Middle East.  Indonesia is sinking so the Muslim problem there will soon be drowned. But Europeans, Aussies, New Zealanders, and us Americans - and the Canadians if they know what&rsquo;s good for them - need to get these pseudo-religious murderers OUT of our countries and back to wherever they came from.  They have no place here and never will.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;ve got to respect the diversity strategy unfolding here. First establish that Turks belong in Germany. Turks are Muslims so that means Islam belongs in Germany. That means African Muslims are welcome. So how can you exclude African Christians? Might as well throw the doors wide open to everybody. </p>

		<p>Finally someone has guts to say it! I will go one step further. Islam does not belong in Western Civilization. Contrary to the popular belief there is no such thing as &#8220;moderate muslims&#8221;. They all must obey koran whose main goal is to make sure other religions/civilizations are eliminated. There is a reason why our ancestors have been fighting islam for the past 1400 years. They were smart enough to understand that survival was at stake. Apparently most politicians don&rsquo;t get it.   </p>

		<p>Muslims and Islam are alien to Western culture and do not belong in Germany or anywhere else besides the Middle East. Muslims do not intend to assimilate or take on the core values and customs of the countries they infiltrate, and never will. Their goal is to attack their host country like a virus and eventually overcome it. Once sharia law is in place, the country becomes just one more stepping stone on the road to total domination.<br>
They must be repulsed at all cost&hellip;</p>

		<p>People do not let yourselves be fooled. This one politico on one certain day saying this or that is meaningless because it is all strategy. The German elections are coming up this year in a number of states and next year for chancellor, this explains the outburst. Fact is the doors are wide open in Germany to all comers with the German industry bosses demanding more foreign labor since German women did not have babies in the past 30 yrs. to fill the factories with eager little wage slaves of German affiliation. The politicians will say anything only to change their judgment at the drop of a hat if party requirements call for it. This minister&rsquo;s bogus pronouncement claiming that Muslims do not belong to Germany is part of this. Today Germany is being overwhelmed by millions of Muslim invaders and the politicians are the ones that made it possible.</p>

		<p>They talk out of both sides of their mouth, as needed.  The response to Thilo Sarazin&rsquo;s book has something to do with this. Pacify those getting a bit restless with the situation, get elected again and then go back to brown nosing the muslims. There are way too many Germans who are upset about this statement, the North is going to bad mouth the Bavarians again, who so far always have had the most sense and the best State. If it ever comes to fighting, it will be awful. The people have no weapons, the Germans are pansies and the Turks use knives. Heaven help us all. </p>
