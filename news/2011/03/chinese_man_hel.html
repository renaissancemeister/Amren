<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>FBI agents Tuesday arrested a Chinese national working for a US technology company for exporting information about sensitive military know-how to China, justice officials said.</p>
<p>Liu Sixing, also know as Steve Liu, was arrested at his home in Deerfield, Illinois and charged with one count of exporting defense-related technical data without a license, the Justice Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Liu, a Chinese national with permanent residency in the United States, worked for the New Jersey-based company from March 2009 until November 2010 as a senior engineer on a team developing precision navigation devices.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were also images of a presentation Liu made to a technology conference which was organized by the Chinese government, the statement said.</p>
<p>Liu was never issued with a company laptop, and did not have the authority to access the company data outside of its New Jersey facility.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m shocked, I tell you!  Who in their wildest dreams could have ever predicted that a Chinese national would have allegiance to, well, China?</p>
<p>I know it never occurred to me, and it obviously never occurred to our government.  The idea that someone would like their own people and homeland more than they would like a foreign country or a foreign race, is simply crazy talk!  Why if this were true, then it would be dangerous to import millions of foreigners into the USA each year.     </p>

		<p>Yes, blood is thicker than water, and ethnic loyalty of a new immigrant to their old country is often stronger than the loyalty they profess to their new country. For some reason, our political class believes that bringing in millions of non-assimilating, and even enemy, aliens and having them recite a pledge of allegiance will automatically make them trustworthy Americans.  We now have millions of such citizens who are far more emotionally attached to their homeland than they are to America.  The type of activity noted in this report is far more common, particularly for the Chinese it seems, than most Americans realize.  Just for reference, I once had an aquaintance who spoke with heartfelt admiration for his country. His people were producing far beyond the world average, and they had built a generally safe, prosperous, and well run democracy.  My acquaitance had lived in the U.S. his entire life, and had worked his way up into a position of authority within the American company at which we worked, and was well paid.  His country though, of which he spoke so highly, was of course, Taiwan.</p>

		<p>Here is another article.</p>
<p>&#8220;US IT contractor could get 20 years for speaking at a conference&#8221;<br>
https://tinyurl.com/66yfzn7<br>
From the referenced article:<br>
&#8220;&hellip;<br>
However there is a little bit of &#8220;not quite right&#8221; about the black and white approach and declaring Liu a spy.</p>
<p>Computerworld said that William Parker, founder of biotechnology company Creative MicroSystems, who spoke at the conference in 2009, regards the event as a legitimate international forum for international researchers, designed to advance understanding of specific aspects of nanotechnology.</p>
<p>While it was unusual to speak without clearance from your company, a lot of the information goes public.</p>
<p>It seems like a jolly odd spying operation that involves you talking at a public event in China and then going back with all the stolen documents in your briefcase.<br>
&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Liu&rsquo;s mistake was to travel abroad, anywhere abroad.</p>
<p>It is a sad fact that once a person of color (in this case Chinese) becomes an Engineer, there is no turning back.  The Engineer faces the life long, self-imposed restriction to remaining within the borders of the continental United States of America.  In addition to being &#8220;land locked&#8221; to America, the Engineer must be very careful whom he chooses for friends.  With very rare exceptions, the Engineer must choose Caucasians for friends.  It is the price to be paid for becoming an Engineer.</p>
<p>The famous author, Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, famously said, &#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;  My own corollary: &#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technologist is indistinguishable from a magician (or a warlock, or a witch).&#8221;</p>
<p>Steve Liu is now caught in the tempest of a witch hunt.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

		<p>Its interesting how in the Article They make it clear (right off the bat) that He is a &#8220;Chinese National&#8221;. Then they say that He is a &#8220;Chinese National with permanent American residency&#8221;. So basically He is living in America and has the Status of<br>
an American Citizen. I might cynically add that if, for example, He<br>
had just won an award then They would be trumpeting that &#8220;He is an American&#8221;. And if You were to say otherwize &#8220;You are a Racist&#8221;. I hear all the time how someone Who just set foot in a Country like the U.S. or Canada or Britain is American, Canadian, or British.</p>

		<p>I wrote in another thread that I live in Las Vegas and I can&rsquo;t walk around without tripping over an Asian. Very few of which I am guessing have very little loyalty to this country. Like almost all recent immigrants to this country, they are simply here because they can have things.</p>

		<p>East Asians are the foremost threat to white survival.  How are white people going to engineer their way out of this East Asian vortex?  East Asians are flooding our colleges and suffocating white society&rsquo;s next generation of innovations, they make so many of the products we use and are holding our debt.  White people of the past were not smart enough to say we can&rsquo;t deal with these people, now white societies are CHAINED to East Asian societies specifically China.  It&rsquo;s going to get more and more difficult for the military to keep secrets as more and more East Asians push out white students from higher learning institutions where the talent pool involves people who work for the other side.  I think the Justice Department only stratched the surface in this case, there are likely more involved.  The Chinese use multiple redundant collection platforms, the same technique the Japanese did to gather information about Pearl Harbor to launch and attack.  It involves multiple people gathering small bits of information then sending it back home unlike Western spying involving a single spy gathering as much information as possible.</p>

		<p>There might be some room in this topic for the vision of<br>
Enoch Powell that the axis of the future would run from London, through D.C., to Bejing.  The Chinese do assimilate rather well with Northern Europeans, and from the mixed race yields I&rsquo;ve seen, the world is better for it.  There will be no renaissance of<br>
America, England, or recent China  &mdash;  for that matter.  If we make the right choices, no contribution to the future dominant axis will be any more prominent than that of our own.  Interesting that<br>
a major concern by the Bejing government now is the extent to which PRC exchange students ( a massive number, BTW) return to<br>
China with all manner of Chinglish expressions.  Great!!</p>

		<p>I personally know of Chinese nationals working in the Naval Research Labs on classified and sensitive systems who have relatives back in China.  They are dual citizenship citizens.  Used to be a time that anybody with such a connection could not even obtain a security clearance, let alone work in Defense industries or federal installations. There are many Chinese nationals working at Lawrence Livermore, and other places doing highly restricted, top level work with relatives who remain back in China (thereby providing pressure by the Chinese government on the relative here in the US).  A LOT of these placements occurred when Clinton was in office.  Folks have probably forgotten that Clinton (both Mr and Mrs) had huge campaign and &#8220;library&#8221; contributions from Chinese nationals and perhaps even the Chinese government.  All swept under the rug by our treasonous MSM.  Stories such as this come out frequently.  And it&rsquo;s probably only the tip of the ice berg.<br>

		<p>As an engineer at Boeing I am amazed at how stupid/naive the management is. At least 30% of engineering staff is foreign. And yes, a lot of them from China. Most are planning on going back to their native countries. Just wondering what information they will be taking back with them.</p>

<p>Does East Asians control the content and direction of american mainstream culture? Does East Asians control the bulk of US banking? Are East Asians the inventors and spreaders of cultural marxism? Do East Asians have the biggest, best connected and best financed ethnic lobby in the USA? I think not. East Asians are merely the replacement high skill serf class slated to replace whites in high skill support positions. </p>

		<p>Asians are very hypocritical. You can&rsquo;t stay in their country for too long but they feel entitled to live in yours and bring in as many of their own family via chain immigration as possible. You can&rsquo;t  become what they are nationality wise but they think they can be American just being here. <br>

		<p>According to this American Military Intellience report &#8216;Joint Operating Environment 2010&rsquo;.</p>
<p><a href="/files/JOE2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.peakoil.net/files/JOE2010.pdf</a><br>
(From page 42 on China.)</p>
<p>&hellip;..&#8221;In the year 2000,the PLA (Peoples Libertion Army) had more students in America&rsquo;s graduate schools than the U.S. military, giving the Chinese a growing understanding of America and its military. As a potential future military competitor, China would<br>
represent a most serious threat to the United States, because the Chinese could understand America and its strengths and weaknesses far better than Americans understand the Chinese&#8221;.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that Amrener&rsquo;s read this report, predicting the next 25 yrs of economic, demographic and political trends.<br>
It is a sobering read.</p>

No one forces us to buy so many Chinese products. <br>

Would we be better if China stopped buying our debt? It is not their fault we refuse to tax ourselves heavily enough to fund spending programs we insist in preserving, including a military that costs nearly as much as the rest of the world spends on defense.<br>
