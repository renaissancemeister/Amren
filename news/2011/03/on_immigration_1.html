<h1><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/06/nation/la-na-illegal-immigration-20110306">On Immigration, Momentum Shifts Away From Arizona</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nicholas Riccardi, Los Angeles Times, March 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A year ago, a revolution on immigration enforcement seemed underway, with legislators in at least 20 states vowing to follow the lead of Arizona&rsquo;s tough new law targeting illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In at least six states, the proposals have been voted down or have simply died. Many of the other proposals have not even made it past one legislative chamber.</p>
<p>The most-discussed provision in the Arizona law requires police to investigate the status of people they legally stop whom they also suspect are illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>But even in Arizona, several tough immigration proposals have been stalled in the Senate, with business leaders and some Republicans arguing that the state does not need more controversy.</p>
<p>The one state whose Legislature has passed an Arizona-style law, Utah, only approved a diluted bill accompanied by another measure that goes in a dramatically different direction.</p>
<p>The Utah Legislature on Friday voted to create ID cards for &#8220;guest workers&#8221; and their families, provided they pay a fine and don&rsquo;t commit serious crimes. {snip}</p>
<p>Utah&rsquo;s measure is essentially a state version of the comprehensive immigration reform that many backers of the Arizona approach deride as amnesty.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The main factor behind the retreat is skittishness about costs, said Ann Morse, who tracks immigration legislation for the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Arizona was sued by the Obama administration, which secured an injunction against most of the law. That ruling is under appeal and expected to reach the Supreme Court, costing millions in legal fees. Arizona was also hit by boycotts and canceled conventions.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the situation in Georgia symbolizes why it has been difficult to pass Arizona-style laws. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, campaigned on bringing such legislation to Georgia, but allies accuse him of equivocating because he hasn&rsquo;t vowed to sign the proposal that passed the state House of Representatives on Thursday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Arizona itself, SB 1070 helped propel Republicans to record margins in both chambers of the Legislature and to a clean sweep of statewide elected offices during the November election. Polls show the measure is very popular in the state and nationwide.</p>
<p>But its author, Senate President Russell Pearce, has been unable to replicate the measure&rsquo;s smooth passage with the latest batch of immigration laws. {snip}</p>
<p>Proposals to require that hospitals check patients&rsquo; immigration status, that teachers and social workers refer suspected illegal immigrants to the federal government and that U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants be denied citizenship have all squeaked through state Senate committees. They have yet to face a vote in the full Senate. It&rsquo;s possible the measures will ultimately pass, but many political observers in the state are surprised there has been Republican opposition to them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics call Utah&rsquo;s guest-worker effort an unconstitutional attempt to create a state-level immigration policy just to send a message to a deadlocked Washington. That was also a central criticism of Arizona&rsquo;s law.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The main factor behind the retreat is skittishness about costs&#8221;: Not quite as expensive as losing your country, but those concerned so much about short-term money rarely view passing a stable nation onto their children and grand-children as being anything worthwhile.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we just hand this country over to Mexico and be done with it. It&rsquo;s going to take the American people, not any of our useless legislators to do anything. The question is, will the American people ever get off their lazy, brainwashed backsides? I want to say yes but I doubt that will happen until things get so bad, they can&rsquo;t take it anymore, but by then, it will be too late.</p>

		<p>This reporter is trying his best to make it appear as if the anti-immigrant sentiment is reversing.</p>
<p>The fact that so many states WILL pass anti-illegal measures is something most of thought would never happen.</p>
<p>And, the states where legislation is lingering?  Just let one outrageous incident occur involving illegals, and see how fast the legislation gets passed.  &#8220;Lingering&#8221; in committe is just another term for &#8220;waiting for the most opportune time.&#8221;</p>

		<p>          As ever in Conservative America, convenience and profit triumph over principle - even among people who profess to believe in those principles. But on the Left, principles determine policy with absolute rigidity. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that their principles are wrong - the very strength of their convictions carry them to victory over the cowardly lions of conservatism. </p>

		<p>Just what we needed - a bunch of wimps who are all talk, but can&rsquo;t see the fight through. Aside from the economy, the invasion and occupation of our country by illegal aliens, primarily from Mexico is our biggest problem. We needed all the help we can get since our President spends his time apologizing for the US standing in the way of the great nation of Mexico doing its thing. Why, they might go to the moon, cure polio or invent the internet. Oh, sorry, we&rsquo;ve already done that. Well, what would they do? Maybe march and demand to be treated like citizens of the US while bringing their corrupt culture to us. So, hand us over, Congress. Guess you don&rsquo;t have grandkids that will reap the harvest. </p>

<p>Whites need to pull the plug on this monstrosity of a &#8220;nation&#8221; and start over somewhere else.</p>

		<p>You mean laws were introduced by politicians on behalf of the people then voted on to see if they are to go into effect?</p>
<p>This is crazy!  Obama better start suing more states or there might be a Democracy emerging in the USSA.</p>
<p>How will the 20% of the Liberals control the other 80% of the people if these laws are introduced, voted on, and passed?</p>

<p>When I read your comment I just had to respond.</p>
<p>If you hate this country, then THOSE PEOPLE are succeeding in their objective. Don&rsquo;t let that happen! America is the greatest country God ever graced this planet with. It&rsquo;s much too good for THOSE PEOPLE. </p>
<p>The U.S. Government, on the other hand, has become nothing but a humongous, vile corruption; ever more an anti-white support mechanism for THOSE PEOPLE; and if you want to hate it rather than the country, I say huzzah! and I&rsquo;m right there with you because it&rsquo;s that government that is our enemy, not the country. </p>
<p>And we should not start over some other place as you mention. When that abomination in DC falls, as it eventually must, we whites will need to fight for our country; but that isn&rsquo;t anything new for us because we and our fathers and our father&rsquo;s fathers all the way back to the beginning have always fought for our land &mdash; because it&rsquo;s worth it. And when the inevitable aftermath of the Fall of DC is dealt with, we whites will finally see that we do not have to share our country with THOSE PEOPLE, nor should we.</p>
<p>Enough is ENOUGH!   <br/>

		<p>11-JBB: I believe you and 7-Russ are arguing from a similar point of view, in that you both comment from a White racialist mindset. The idea to &#8220;start over somewhere else&#8221;, will probably be somewhere in North America, but will most likely not include much of what is now the Southern parts of the U.S.  I just can&rsquo;t see the shrinking, ageing, White racialists of America being strong enough to push out the soon to be numerically superior and younger non-White population.  The other side will also have the liberal and clueless Whites as their allies.  I can see a smaller White nation that we could possibly defend, but I can&rsquo;t see the current land mass of the U.S. ever being an all-White nation.</p>
