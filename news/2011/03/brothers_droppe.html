<h1>Brothers Dropped from Soccer Event  &mdash;  for Their Genes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Goodman, Bakersfield, March 21, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Arie and Nigel Kapoor have an Indian father and Indian friends. They&rsquo;ve participated for years in the local Indian community. But at a soccer tournament last weekend, the brothers weren&rsquo;t quite Indian enough.</p>
<p>Their team, the Bakersfield Lightning, was disqualified and forced to forfeit its game after the opposing squad&rsquo;s coach complained about the Kapoor brothers&rsquo; genes.</p>
<p>The boys&rsquo; father, Sunny, is from India. But their mother is American, and the event&rsquo;s organizer said that was against the rules this year.</p>
<p>Satnum Manku, coordinator of the fourth annual Bakersfield Soccer Cup, said Thursday a rule sheet was sent to participants a month before the invitational tournament. One of the conditions: No half-Indian players allowed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Conflicts of interest</strong></p>
<p>The issue didn&rsquo;t arise until after halftime Saturday, when the game was stopped and the Lightning was told it had violated the eligibility rule.</p>
<p>Julie Kapoor, the boys&rsquo; mother and a longtime Bakersfield resident, said her sons previously had never faced exclusion as a result of their mixed background.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was ridiculous,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&rsquo;s supposed to be fun and recreational.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The organizer argued that the influx of non-Indian talent, which he said has included semi-professional players with fake identification cards, compromises that goal. And so the rule was born.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Similar restrictions, however, are in place for other tournaments in the state, Manku said.</p>
<p>Some of them, for example, allow a certain number of non-Indian players per team. He even knows of at least one such event in California that only permits players who are Punjabi, a subset of the Indian population.</p>
<p>Manku said he and his staff try to determine a disputed player&rsquo;s Indian background by asking for his birth certificate, which shows the names of both parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a good rule,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But the other teams said, &#8216;If you guys don&rsquo;t keep this rule, we won&rsquo;t come to play.&rsquo; So we had to keep the rule.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Right direction?</strong></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Kapoor, manager at the Park Plaza Executive Offices on Oak Street, has been married to Sunny for nearly 25 years and has visited her husband&rsquo;s home country.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The two have raised their children to be &#8220;color-blind,&#8221; Kapoor said, and the boys have embraced their father&rsquo;s heritage.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&rsquo;t know the language, but they know that&rsquo;s their culture,&#8221; Kapoor said. &#8220;And they&rsquo;ve always been comfortable being around Indians&hellip; .   For them to be rejected, it&rsquo;s appalling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It causes pause,&#8221; Nichols said. &#8220;It makes you wonder if we&rsquo;re headed in the right direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is the fate of the half-breed torn between identities. Tne parents should have thought in advance. </p>
<p>I have no problem with this ruling. It means that if they can reject half-Indian players, then we can reject half-American players.  Fair enough.<br>

		<p>Brings the story of Jim Thorpe to mind. So much press and down trodden repetitive stories of poor Jim the Indian. Only he wasn&rsquo;t Indian but half white. His father was the one to help him achieve what he did. It was equally both heritages that brought him to greatness yet the white half was never mentioned. How many people actually know this?</p>

		<p>I guess these East Indian organizers used a loophole in their ability to gain an entrance into a wWhite community event, then went ahead &amp; implemented their own agenda to keep it full blooded Indian. This should be the outcry of all the bleeding heart liberals because they love to see mixed-race relationships. But it wasn&rsquo;t a Caucasian European American who wanted to implement the rule so the libs begrudgingly accepted. No shocker</p>

Is race a genetic reality now? I&rsquo;m confused.</p>
<p>I thought there was so little difference that we&rsquo;re all the same.</p>

<p>I think a better term than &#8220;color-blind&#8221; would be &#8220;white-blind&#8221;.  Like Obama (and so many others), they are blind to their white heritage.  How many half-white/half Indian or half white/ half black people do you know who identify primarily with their white half?  Such people are rarities because it is far more advantageous to be non-white than to be white.  This is because of non-white privilege.</p>

		<p>What the coach of the opposing team did by<br>
Ruling the brothers out was unfair.</p>
<p>Most Indians illegally in America have a small degree of white blood in them which makes up their Caucasoid features.</p>
<p>Indias history, culture, and religion is  adopted from ancient white civilization.</p>
<p>So since Arie and Nigel Kapoor are predominantly black, they are by all respects considered Indian.</p>
<p> Indians have a rough time indentifying the truth in matters of race when <br>
When those truths do not suit them.</p>
<p>The Kapoor brothers deserve a public apology from both their coach and their parents who put them in the position.</p>

		<p>Human biodiversity means some races have different talents to others.   Indians don&rsquo;t appear to be the most athletic, they do well at cricket and such games, however if playing soccer against other Indians it doesn&rsquo;t matter, they can enjoy the competition of roughly equal opponents.   The African-American is well known do well in sprint sports and therefor predominate in Gridiron with its quick team changes.  Europeans can swim very well and while not the greates sprinters (like East Coast Africans) or Long distance runners (like Nth Africans) do very well in mid distances of around 600m.  (A distance not popular in track and field but probably of some evolutionary benefit in European history and quite good for a soccer game).  In Australia it isn&rsquo;t much fun playing Rugby with Pacific Islander&rsquo;s sometimes nearly twice the size of a White child in their teen years.  Hence there should be some room for racial segregation of sports, not only for safety reasons but simply for the sake of the pleasure of a game.</p>

		<p>Since when is it LEGAL to determine eligibility for ANYTHING - be it a sports team, a club, a scout group, a church - by race???  I think this is about as illegal as it can get, and it&rsquo;s also a horrible example to set for the Indian kids.  What would happen if a group of Japanese kids, or Chinese kids, wouldn&rsquo;t let a half-Japanese or half-Chinese kid play on their team?  Or a black kid?  Could you legally have an all-black team - as in &#8220;blacks only?&#8221;  How about a &#8220;whites only&#8221; team?  I am getting very tired of inconsistent rulings on this issue.  Either NOBODY can group together &#8220;by race only,&#8221; OR - EVERYBODY can.  This &#8220;down the middle&#8221; and &#8220;some can, some can&rsquo;t&#8221; garbage needs to be stricken down.  Let&rsquo;s cut the doodoo and get honest.</p>

		<p>Of course if anyone tried to start an all-white sports league (or all-white aything else) all hell would break loose. It doesn&rsquo;t strike me that Indians, the second richest ethnic group in America (after Jews), need a leg up or any other kind of favoritism.</p>
<p>Indians can often seem friendly, but they are quite possibly the most separatist, ethnocentric group in the US. Whenever you see an Indian with a group of friends he is most likely with other Indians. There was a group of Indians who played cricket at a school near my house and the group would get up to as large as 40 or so, counting spectators, and it didn&rsquo;t include a single white (in a town &gt; 80% white and with very few Indians.)</p>
<p>Last summer I attended a wedding at a reception center. There were two other events taking place - an Indian wedding and an Indian graduation party - and even with around 200 guests at the two events there were at most only 3 non-Indian guests.</p>
<p>If in their politics you think they don&rsquo;t consider the best interests of Indians first you&rsquo;re fooling yourself.</p>

		<p>Unless they are using private soccer fields only, the Indian soccer league is in violation of anti-discrimination laws, as are the municipalities permitting them to use the fields.</p>
<p>I am not holding my breath waiting for a civil right suit.</p>
