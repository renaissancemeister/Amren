			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steven Greenhouse, New York Times, March 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An administrative law judge on Friday upheld a $7,000 fine against Wal-Mart Stores that the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration had imposed after a Wal-Mart employee was trampled to death at a Long Island store on Black Friday 2008. </p>
<p>Covette Rooney, the chief administrative law judge of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, upheld the fine in concluding that unruly crowds the day after Thanksgiving were a recognized hazard and that there were feasible means to control that hazard. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>OSHA fined Wal-Mart in response to the death of Jdimytai Damour, a 34-year-old temporary employee, who died from asphyxiation when a stampede of 2,000 shoppers burst through the doors before the store&rsquo;s scheduled opening at 5 a.m., Nov. 28, 2008. </p>

		<p>I am no fan of Wal-Mart and not a Wal-Mart shopper but the actual responsibility for such brutal and uncivilized lies with the black themselves.  Since there was a video of the assault all the people who trampled the door man should have been imprisoned.  The county should have offered a reward to anyone who could positively ID any of the perpetrators.  A little prison time would have been appropriate.  </p>
<p>If Wal-Mart had had too much security they would have gotten in trouble for &#8220;racially profiling&#8221; blacks as potential troublemakers.<br>

		<p>We had our first &#8220;Christmas Free&#8221; holiday season this year. And it was great! After it was all over I asked the other half if she missed the crowds, the useless seasonal items given to those who didn`t rate a &#8220;real&#8221; gift etc. Not a lick! It was liberation from the machine. I even had the realization that the &#8220;Every Kiss begins with Kay&#8221;  jingle was nothing more than an alarm bell meant to incite panic and guilt. You might say I have become Christmas aware&hellip;<br>
  Now let me pontificate on another  related issue. Crowd and fire safety. I was at a disco with a buddy and about 3000 strangers. We were searching for breathing space near the rear.<br>
 Suddenly my friend asked if I knew anything about the volume of a cube. &#8220;Like ice cube?&#8221;, I asked pointing to my Rum and Coke. My friend then asked me, &#8220;If the ceiling caught on fire how long till the fumes came down to our level?&#8221;  I guessed about ten or fifteen minutes&hellip; He then asked &#8220;How long till 3000 drunk people could get out the doors?!?&#8221;  He saw me do the math and realize that there would be at least 500 dead!! So I searched frantically with my eyes until I saw two big double wide panic doors, opening outward (Hat tip Cocoanut Grove). I pointed with relief and gave a  smirk of winning the argument. My buddy slid over to the doors, looked at me and then took a sip and nonchalantly pressed his rear end up against the panic bars. Both doors were locked tighter than a drum!! We finished our drinks near the front and then left quickly there after. Now when ever I go into a public building and see the &#8220;Do Not touch! Alarm will sound!&#8221; I am almost compelled to see if they are locked also&hellip;<br>
 In conclusion I DO think Wal-mart was liable for setting up a stampede&hellip; </p>

<p>And no doubt, to recognise that &#8216;hazard&rsquo; would be considered racist sterotyping and as such, demeaning and offensice, no doubt requiring fines and reparations.</p>

		<p>Frankly, I think Walmart should have been fined way more, enough to actually hurt.<br>
Sure, the individual blacks are responsible, but ultimately Walmart is responsible for training their employees.  The poor guy that died should have been trained as to what to expect once that door was unlocked.  Moreover, Walmart knows how blacks behave on that day.  They know very well.  Odds are, the management itself was black.  Which doesn&rsquo;t mean they were more likely to recognize the danger, but really means they were more likely to be flat incompetent.<br>

		<p>When millions of cash-strapped shoppers enter WalMart, they hear the angels sing. It&rsquo;s the wide selection for one-stop shopping, low prices to save the family budget, and many are open 24 hours per day. The Waltons have given us the place for the lower quartile as well as for &#8220;the rich,&#8221; who can sneak in at odd times in disguise and happily mingle with the commoners. In truth, their wages are on average HIGHER than the Mom and Pop stores they replace. They pay better benefits and have more opportunities for women and minorities than offered at the little boxes. Each new store has thousands of applications for associate positions in good times and bad, like now. They are also the target of a relentless campaign to deconstruct their franchise through class action legal attacks, bad press, and union strategies. Don&rsquo;t believe the myths and go ahead and buy that case of oil and save five bucks with no guilt. So many people want to pay more for the same goods and undermine the darned yahoo capitalists from Arkansas. It seems they are so popular with the underclass, that they storm the doors for a low price, imperiling their fellow shoppers. That is the problem of so many under-socialized consumers, not bad store management. A few people might get trampled in the process because Momma didn&rsquo;t raise them right. It happens. The anti-capitalism nut cases who rage against multinational corporations have adopted WalMart as their economic villain. We the people have voted with our feet&hellip;right through the doors of WalMart, where a smiling handicapped guy welcomes us in. Where would he be without WalMart?</p>

<p>As I understand it, the doors were forced open before the employees were ready to unlock them and admit the customers. As such each and every unauthorized person in that store at the time of the fatal trampling should have been charged with  breaking and entering, then the law would have been able to additionally charge each one with aggravated manslaughter. (Aggravated as in one crime committed during the commission of another.) <br>

		<p>I posted a detailed account of my visit to The east sanfreak sicko bay area walmarts a few years ago. I don&rsquo;t remember any comments on it.<br>
Long story short. At one wally world (Milpitas? Fremont?), I saw not one single white employee. The management was all Vietnamese, Chinese, or Mexican. Not a single one could comprehend, or speak a word of english.</p>
<p>I know, because I demanded a manager to explain to me why thirteen of fifteen exit doors were locked and blocked by massive rows of shopping carts, anchored by very heavy shopping cart pushing machines.</p>
<p>The manager or asissistant not only could not understand me, but clearly didn&rsquo;t care  <br>
what I had to say. I marched a manager out to the doors and plainly said this was a very serious fire code violation, and Wal Mart would be severely fined if a fire officer visited. Mr Asia didn&rsquo;t even understand a word.</p>
<p>I visited a week or two later&hellip;same scene, exactly.</p>
<p>How on EARTH can anyone explain how this could happen in a Wal mart in the USA, even in The east bay area of san fan cisco, CA?<br>
It boggles the mind. But it explains why third worlders die in big piles.</p>

		<p>Wal-Mart knowingly set up a  dangerous situation to increase customer competition in hopes of instilling a sense of urgency to spend and buy. Kind of like making people on The Titanic wait together until the water reached their ankles before putting life-jackets on sale. Yes, the &#8220;customers&#8221; may have been incapable of thinking one step ahead and acting civilized but you can bet Wal-Mart was thinking five steps ahead and realized their clientele would react this way and capitalized on it. That`s their crime&hellip;</p>

		<p>With people now recording such behavior on cell phones and posting it online, all the world can at last observe the problems underclass blacks inflict on society.  Some of these incidents are even making it into the TV MSM, since the videos can be shown without any comment about race.  Such revelations are thinning the liberal argument that racially conscious whites are just being irrationally hateful when they desire segregation from blacks.  <br>
When I worked in a large city, I found that middle-class blacks are as afraid of the ghetto as are whites.  I just wish such people would speak out publicly against the criminal element of their ethnicity and not either say nothing or provide knee-jerk defenses to bad black behavior.  </p>

<p>I live in a predominantly White area.  And I was pretty well shocked at what I was seeing!  People running with carts&hellip;it was wild!</p>
<p>I can only imagine what a majority-Black stampede would be like&hellip;. *shudder*</p>

		<p>My Lord, how simple can it be?  Tramplings at Wal-Mart happen every year on the exact same calander date.  A death occurred in 2008 and more will occur in the future.  Do I have to be a dang psychic to predict this?  No, these deaths are just collateral damage and Wal-Mart considers them nothing more than that.  They had to shovel out a whopping $7,000 to OSHA to compensate for a death?  Doesn&rsquo;t such a pittance empower Wal-Mart to do it all over again?  I think so.  Bottom line, if you think your life is worth the savings on a blue-ray player, by all means step to the front of the line.  If you do, you don&rsquo;t have the right to blame Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart has already been told that potential disasters and tramplings are escentially ok by the law so a smart person will protect themselves by not being there.  If you decide to put yourself there you might as well go for a pleasure cruise in a yacht off the coast of Somalia or take a hike on the Iranian border.  Either way, you&rsquo;d get no sympathy from me.</p>

		<p>There is a legal concept called &#8220;attractive nuisance&#8221;.  The idea is that putting candy in front of children and expecting them to not take it is contrary to all normal experience.  Therefore, you are liable for damages if you have a swimming pool without a fence, and a neighbor child trespasses and drowns.  Clearly, the concept is applicable to this case.  Wal-Mart really ought to have known better.<br>

		<p>Maybe now WalMart will re-configure their aisles in their stores, in predominately black areas, of course, to resemble the chutes and passageways that are used in stockyards, that have only enough width that allows one body/animal? at a time to pass through.  This may also be a way to cut down on shoplifting, a favorite activity of u no hoo.  </p>
<p>I recently learned the WalMart near me is going to do a remodel of their store, and remove the self-checkout stations.  I asked why the removal, and was told it is due to theft  &mdash;  people switching price tags on items, then going to the self-check stations to scan and then pay (less) for said items.  It would be interesting to see who those are doing this price tag switching.</p>

<p>The man who was killed was 6ft 5 about 350 pds.  When the pre opening crowd started banging on the doors the management got all the biggest male employees to the doors to try and control the crowd.  Sounds like they did everything they could.</p>
<p>But if Walmart dares any more effective crowd of blacks they will be fined hundreds of thousands of dollars by the Justice department.  Better to pay $7,000 once in a while.</p>

		<p>Kent   &mdash;   here&rsquo;s the difference. The Who concert was ONE time. Brawls like this are in the news almost weekly these days, always the same people.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get so nostalgic for the 50&rsquo;s-70&rsquo;s. In small towns, you could ride your bike all over and not come home till dark&hellip;and nobody worried. Even in the cities, when changes started coming in the late 60&rsquo;s, they were still basically laid-back. I was in San Diego then, and it didn&rsquo;t start getting bad till the 80&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Which made me wonder about #63&rsquo;s comment&hellip;think I worked at a SD Sears that was turned into an unemployment offfice. Wonder if we&rsquo;re thinking of the same place.<br>
