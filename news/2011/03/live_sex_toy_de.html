<h1>Live Sex Toy Demonstration Held on Northwestern Campus</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jodi Cohen and Lisa Black, Chicago Tribune, March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Northwestern University acknowledged that an unusual demonstration was held on campus last week in which students observed a naked woman being penetrated by a sex toy.</p>
<p>The sex act was performed in front of about 100 students in psychology professor John Michael Bailey&rsquo;s human sexuality class. The demonstration occurred after class, and attendance was optional.</p>
<p>The university will pay several hundred dollars to guest lecturer Ken Melvoin-Berg, co-owner of Weird Chicago Tours. His Feb. 21 discussion of bondage, swinging and other sexual fetishes was arranged by Bailey, who gets extra funding from the university&rsquo;s College of Arts &amp; Sciences for lectures and other activities he routinely holds after class.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After an initial discussion at Ryan Family Auditorium, the class was told that a couple was going to demonstrate the use of a sex toy and female orgasm.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The woman undressed and got on stage with her male partner, who used a device that looks like a machine-powered saw with a phallic object instead of a blade. Melvoin-Berg said the couple are exhibitionists who enjoy having people watch them have sex, and they were not paid for the demonstration.</p>
<p>Jim Marcus said he and his fiancé hadn&rsquo;t planned to show off the sex act at first, but decided to do so after the class watched a video on female orgasm that he thought was unrealistic. They already had brought the equipment to show as part of the discussion.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He said the demonstration with his fiancé, Faith Kroll, was different from a live sex show or pornography.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was more than happy to. We have fun with it,&#8221; Kroll said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m an exhibitionist. I enjoy the attention, being seen by other people. It was entertaining because there were a lot of curious minds, so that was cool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What we did was not designed to titillate people, but to educate people,&#8221; Marcus said. He said the demonstration was accompanied by a discussion about safety and consent, for example.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Melvoin-Berg called it an educational experience for the students, and said it lasted about three minutes. &#8220;We wanted to share not only our lifestyles and talk about it, but demonstrate what we do in our personal lives,&#8221; he said. The students, he said, &#8220;seemed to be incredibly pleased. We had a number of them that got closer and closer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Melvoin-Berg said he typically earns $300 to $500 for an hour-long lecture, and that Northwestern had agreed to pay in that range.</p>

		<p>The whole &#8220;free love, free sex&#8221; movement of the &#8216;60&rsquo;s (of which we still feel the effects today) was not really about the elimination of &#8220;repression&#8221; at all (sexual or otherwise). It was merely about the replacement of one form of &#8220;repression&#8221; with another. </p>
<p>&#8220;Sexual repression&#8221; was replaced by repression of freedom of speech and thought concerning race. In other words, one taboo was simply replaced with another. </p>
<p>To the lefties, it was a good deal. They could have their much coveted &#8220;sexual freedom&#8221; (of course that AIDs thing did get in the way just a bit) and yet they could assuage their guilt by replacing taboos against &#8220;free sex&#8221; with taboos against &#8220;racism&#8221; (free speech), thereby reassuring themselves that they were still good, wonderful and noble people.</p>
<p>Of course the fact that it was all hypocrisy didn&rsquo;t matter; all that mattered was that it was a &#8220;feel good&#8221; movement.</p>

		<p>As a child of the 60&rsquo;s, I am amazed that these kids NEEDED a live demo.  When WE were that age, we had already found out for ourselves about vibrators, orgasms, etc. etc.  Don&rsquo;t these kids have any curiosity and desire to experiment for themselves?</p>

		<p>This is an outrage! The couple deserve to be paid! <br>
   Outside of the issue of university funds being spent, how is this different that what is seen on prime time television? The students were Psychology students. They knew what they were going to see. Next thing you know, they will complain about the dead bodies being cut up by the medical students.</p>

		<p>The above story is simply disgusting. White people on this forum like to complain of the moral degeneracy of black Americans and Hispanics. Why are whites not condemning this disgusting display of open degeneracy by whites?</p>
<p>In the 1950s, when white Americans believed in traditional family values, racial minorities in America were much better behaved. The whites were able to set a firm example on what type of behavior was accepted in America, and what types of behavior were frowned upon. But whites in America have developed a culture in which there are no boundaries and no moral standards. Why should they, then, complain that the more impressionable minorities are behaving badly?</p>
<p>In the last days of the Roman Empire, sexual degeneracy was widespread, and this led to a decline in the civic virtues and honor that was needed to keep the empire functioning. Failing to put boundaries on sexuality affects other aspect of human culture, such as honor, self-sacrifice, civic responsibility, trust, etc. White Americans now have a culture devoted to the pursuit of instant gratification, just like the black culture. Any white person who fails to condemn the degeneracy at Northwestern University, has no right to complain when white women throw themselves at the feet of blacks.   </p>

		<p>I cannot pretend to be sophisticated or ho hum about this incident. It&rsquo;s perverse, disgusting, and speaks to the sewer our society has become. Why hasn&rsquo;t the prof been bounced out of his job? Oh yeah, birds of a feather. And these doofus kids spending good tuition money on a human sexuality course that&rsquo;s just pornography. Have they checked out the job market lately??</p>

		<p>Well, about 5 years ago I worked at a company that sold sex toys. This was after my husband and I had lost our business and had to file bankruptcy. I took orders over the telephone. </p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of experience with the porn industry. Northwestern University can call it want they want, but this is porn, pure and simple. </p>
<p>By the way, I have a degree in Biology, but I&rsquo;ve often thought that the humanities people are a little bit strange. Maybe it&rsquo;s too much &#8220;thinking.&#8221;  <br>

		<p>I only took one course from the college of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences from my university. It was a core class. It must have fit into my schedule. One day in class we watched the video of our instructor&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s birth. There were no close-ups and it wasn&rsquo;t too graphic. The biggest surprise was that a man in a white coat that I thought was a doctor or a hospital employee was actually her husband. She&rsquo;s white. He&rsquo;s black. But, how closed off could she think we were? </p>
<p>In college I went to a sex toy party at a friend&rsquo;s apartment at another college. It was like a tupperware party. I did not buy anything. A shy friend of ours bought some fragranted oils. It was hysterical. No one was there to &#8220;demonstrate what we do in our personal lives&#8221;, probably because in front of a room of 8 college females or an entire body of strangers makes it no longer personal! </p>
<p>Is nothing sacred or personal anymore?!</p>

		<p>At least they got spared the 70&rsquo;s style more hair than a hair band beaver video, with commentary by man-hating lesbian instructor I had during undergrad. Even my beloved got the same experience in graduate school, except they also tacked on a 4 day GBLTGTS workshop, and spent 4 weeks out of the 6 weeks of her class teaching only to those issues. Heterosexual issues barely earned a single night, and only on a shared stage. Never mind that the majority of her clients will be straight, as is the population at large. </p>
<p> Posters 6,7 I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more. Our institutions have been poisoned with this for a long time, as well as our society; we are reaping what has been sown. </p>
