<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Students in schools in the largest U.S. cities, many from low-income households, trail their peers elsewhere in the country in a test of science proficiency, according to a report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Fourth- and eighth-graders in most of the 17 participating urban districts typically scored lower than the national average, the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress Science report showed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results are shouting at us: Whatever we are doing in science education in these big city public schools, it isn&rsquo;t working for the vast majority of our students,&#8221; said Alan Friedman, a member of the National Assessment Governing Board.</p>
<p>The analysis, also known as the Nation&rsquo;s Report Card, Trial Urban District Assessment, tested between 900 and 2,200 students in each grade in school districts from San Diego to New York, including students in Atlanta and Boston public schools and the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Demographics of the participating urban districts vary from both the national average and between districts.</p>
<p>Some districts report that English is not the first language of up to 40 percent of their students. Anywhere from 47 percent to 100 percent of students in the urban areas are from lower-income families, according to the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report card showed that 44 percent of fourth-graders at schools in cities with a population of at least 250,000 fall below the standard for basic proficiency in science, compared to 29 percent nationally.</p>
<p>At the eighth grade level 56 percent of big city public school students fell below the basic standard compared to 38 percent nationally.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the problem?  These kids have a teacher that looks &#8220;just like them&#8221; (see original article).  Wasn&rsquo;t that supposed to fix everything?  Isn&rsquo;t he a &#8216;role model&rsquo;?  </p>

		<p>The reason for the difference in standardized test scores is gravity. You see, there are tall buildings in urban areas, and the mass of these buildings creates a gravitational force that acts to pull the blood of urban students away from their feet, and towards their heads. This phenomenon increases the blood pressure in the minds of these urban students and makes it harder for these urban students to concentrate on their studies, and results in low standardized test scores, for urban students. The answer is new building codes.</p>
<p>It all makes sense, when you think about it.</p>
<p>Now, may I please have my six-figure job at the Department of Education?<br>

<p>That&rsquo;s because science is about facts, truth, and logic. 3 things &#8220;Urban&rsquo;s&#8221; are incapable of.</p>

<p>There are so few blacks who can even begin to understand the basic concepts involved in science it&rsquo;s pitiful to see there are people still pretending to try to understand why blacks can&rsquo;t earn accreditation in the field.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll thrash through the entire litany of remedial methods, and when no progress is made, they&rsquo;ll pretend to be as baffled as they ever were.  </p>
<p>Then some black fool we&rsquo;ll begin screaming about not having enough teachers, enough money, and when he gets all that, but still no progress is made, he&rsquo;ll want smaller classes, outside tutoring and when that too fails, he&rsquo;ll scream to the world how the racist, bigotted white system treats blacks outrageously by denying them the same quality education as whites.</p>
<p>And there will still be no appreceiable number of blacks in the field of science, and those who are there will be AA awardees.</p>

<p>My advise to you, Mr. Friedman, is not to take it so personally.  You&rsquo;re not doing much of anything wrong, save thinking that you can do something right.  The bottleneck is that many of the students in big city public schools are incapable of learning such material.  And it&rsquo;s not like fourth and eighth grade science curricula, especially the type in big city urban public schools, are the most g-loaded and cerebral of material, relative to more advanced science education.</p>

		<p>The basis of Marxism is class conflict. Marx believed that workers were exploited by the factory owners. However, you generally find that workers are loyal; they are not stupid and know that if the factory closes, they lose their jobs.</p>
<p>So Marxists moved on to other conflicts. If men and women have different outcomes in life it means that men exploit women.</p>
<p>And if races differ in outcomes, it means that one race exploits the other.</p>
<p>Darwinian evolution has been used to weaken Christianity, which Marxists like to do. However, Darwinian evolution is rejected when it suggests that populations (races) may differ in abilities &mdash; Marxists don&rsquo;t like that.</p>
<p>Marxists are careful about those sorts of things.<br>

		<p>Why journalists act as though they can&rsquo;t figure this out is absurd.</p>
<p>For one, blacks, by and large, aren&rsquo;t very analytical, the type of reasoning that science requires.  They are strictly direct thinkers, for the most part, meaning that they can regurgitate material in the way told, and in only that way, but ask anything more and a majority of them have major problems comprehending what is asked.  They have difficulty synthesizing information, making something out of information to solve a complex question or task.</p>
<p>The achievement gap will not close.  It never has, why do we think it will now?  Blacks have a lower IQ, and it is completely genetic.  You can&rsquo;t expect most of them to perform at a level at which is above their intelligence.</p>

		<p>They do not do well because they do no work . There is a segment of society which prizes illiteracy and ignorance, packaged with arrogance you have urban school children who  &#8220;don&rsquo;t know up from down.&#8221;<br>
Self empowered by popular propaganda, they goose step through life until the big brick wall of reality gets in the way . They then blame everyone else but themselves.<br>
Math, physics and &#8220;chem&#8221;  do not &#8220;just happen, &#8221; it takes hours of work to be proficient . </p>

<p>They&rsquo;re already ahead of you.  Many high rise public housing projects have been torn down, not only because of their structural problems, but also because Official Progressive Anti-Racist America has come to the conclusion that human beings living in modern civilization just can&rsquo;t lived stacked so many levels high.</p>
<p>I guess they&rsquo;ve never heard of Manhattan condos.  Here&rsquo;s the kicker   &mdash;   The higher you go in the building, the more expensive the condos get.</p>

I&rsquo;m still holding out hope that all the great black universities in all the great black nations of the world will ultimately turn out great scientists who will cure cancer and AIDS, engineer who will design spaceships to travel to Mars and back, and turn sea water into a fuel used in cars.</p>

Yes, many American school districts are awash in liberal stupidity and dumbed-down curricula - but in the vast majority of these articles it is the &#8220;urban&#8221; students that are the issue&hellip;and we ALL know it!

		<p>all of these officials and educators and spokespeople and talking heads are deliberately and consciously LYING:</p>
<p>none of them would expect a white person with an IQ of 75 to excel in math or science, and they all know that disastrously low cognitive ability is the reason why the vast majority of blacks cannot learn a thing.</p>
<p>mystery solved:</p>
<p>they are just plain old LYING because if they tell the truth, they will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>we will continue to go around in circles until it is socially acceptable to discuss race and IQ publicly.</p>
<p>and it is our job to make it acceptable.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t let all this hand-wringing fool you. Administrators, bureaucrats, etc absolutely LOVE the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;. It gives them an excuse to demand more money to close it and to accuse everyone who disagrees with their getting more money of &#8220;racism&#8221;. And since nothing they do is likely to close the &#8220;achievement gap&#8221; it also gives them unlimited opportunity to demand more money and accuse others of &#8220;racism&#8221;. Yep. Administrators and bureaucrats sure do love that &#8220;achievement gap&#8221;. It&rsquo;s a real cash cow.</p>

<p>The orientals, indians, etc. are not intelligent.  Their only ability is taking over what the White Man created.  That&rsquo;s not intelligence, it&rsquo;s theft.</p>
<p>They count on people like you for you are easy to fool.  You actually believe they&rsquo;re as intelligent as White People yet not a one of you asian lovers&rsquo; has ever explained why, since they&rsquo;re sooooooooooooooo intelligent, why, why, why in the 2011, are their Countries STILL Third Worlds?  And WHY do they flock to The West instead of fixing their own Countries?</p>
<p>Actually, you&rsquo;re right.  They are much smarter than White People for White People aren&rsquo;t smart enough to see they are being taken over by the Hordes from the East and even better, White People such as yourself actually praise them.</p>

<p>White children understand science concepts fairly well at the age of eleven.  Science is entirely developmentally appropriate for white students beginning at about the sixth grade.  Blacks, on the other hand, aren&rsquo;t ready for the most part.  I&rsquo;d say that also applies to the &#8220;basics&#8221;.</p>
