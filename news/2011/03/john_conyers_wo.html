			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Darrell Dawsey, Michigan Live, March 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>U.S. Rep. John D. Conyers (D-Detroit) is criticizing a proposed state law to drastically strengthen the powers of emergency financial managers, calling it unconstitutional and saying it implicitly targets minority communities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill  &mdash;  which will give EFMs in troubled municipalities and school districts the power to void collective bargaining agreements, sell off municipal assets and dissolve elected bodies  &mdash;  has been approved by the state House and Senate. Gov. Rick Snyder is expected to sign it into law this week.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Of course, Detroit and majority-black suburbs like Inkster and Ecorse aren&rsquo;t the only municipalities struggling. Allen Park, for instance, is 95 percent white and in the grip of serious fiscal issues. And Hamtramck, with only a 15 percent black population, is on life support.</p>
<p>But Conyers still raises a point worth considering. Over the past 11 years, Michigan governors have declared financial emergencies in seven municipalities, including the largely black cities of Ecorse, Benton Harbor, Highland Park, Pontiac and Flint. Meanwhile, the state has taken over Detroit&rsquo;s public school system twice since 1999, both times with dismal results.</p>
<p>In almost all of these instances, of course, the financial troubles have been dire indeed. But rather than acknowledge the debilitating affects of deindustrialization, white flight and corporate disinvestment on places like Detroit and Flint, too many observers have been content to simply blame changing racial dynamics. Has this then made it easier to target black-run cities in Michigan with legislation like the proposed EFM law? And will the new law be driven by, or exacerbate, these perceptions? </p>

What Rep. Conyers fears is scrutiny and accountability. He doesn&rsquo;t want people nosing around in black folks shell game of distributing money to those most likely to take what isn&rsquo;t theirs.</p>
<p>Oversight would likely help more blacks but then those in control wouldn&rsquo;t get their unfair share.<br>

		<p>Sounds like Conyers is making a statement that would be racist if a white person uttered it.  Implicit in his comment: blacks can&rsquo;t run things competently.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Rather than acknowledge the debilitating affects of (snip) white flight (snip) on places like Detroit and Flint, too many observers have been content to simply blame changing racial dynamics.&#8221;</p>
<p>So &#8216;white flight&rsquo; is different from &#8216;changing racial dynamics&rsquo; now. That&rsquo;s good to know.</p>
<p>I note that the article doesn&rsquo;t question whether the legislation will actually help towns and cities in trouble, it purely addresses what the perception will be. Who cares about collapsing standards, services and employment when there is the possibility that some black people might be made to look bad?</p>

		<p>Hamtramck is majority Arab-Muslim.  By stating it&rsquo;s &#8220;15 percent black,&#8221; this news source is trying to pull a fast one and imply that it&rsquo;s 85% white.</p>

<p>This demagogue only worries about anything that affects the black community and no one else.</p>
<p>Like all the rest of the blacks, they&rsquo;re only for blacks and black causes, and they couldn&rsquo;t care less about other affairs confronting the country.</p>
<p>Most all of them simply adore Cuba, while hating the US.</p>

		<p>I cannot wait for Conyers to be gone.  He is one of the worst politicians in the history of Michigan.  I honestly would trade him for Juan McAmnesty, no joke.  </p>
<p>I love how anything that doesn&rsquo;t help black people by giving them free money, housing, or access to white facilities is racissss.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get it yet Conyers?  You can NEVER please them!  Give them a new car and they&rsquo;ll call you a racisss because it didn&rsquo;t have the &#8220;limited&#8221;  package.  Give them a free house and they&rsquo;ll say you are racisss for not giving them a four bedroom house, or one in a whiter neighborhood.</p>
<p>Solution:  Give them nothing.  They&rsquo;ll appreciate what they have more.</p>
<p>Lastly, Michigan is still the ONLY state to have LIFETIME welfare.  All those blacks from Chicago, Gary, and St. Louis are coming here.  Ya think maybe that is why our (MI) state&rsquo;s budget is almost as bad as California&rsquo;s? </p>

		<p>Not just Michigan but NJ has &#8220;unofficial&#8221; lifetime welfare.  It is called &#8220;the chronically unemployable&#8221;.  After &#8220;intensive&#8221; job coaching if you still can not get or hold a job you become classified as chronically unemployable.  You not only get lifetime welfare benefits you get an extra $150.00 a month on spending cash.<br>

		<p>Of course counties with a substantial black (and other minority and immigrant) population are in bad shape.  Too many tax eaters and not enough taxpayers.  When employed people are paying more for their medical, more for their food, more for their electricity, more for their cell phones, more for their rent or mortgage, then look around and see millions getting all that and more for free&hellip;well, how much can they take?</p>
<p>8-Istvan, or their social workers encourage them to get SSI.  Gov. Christie will never go after the lifetime benefits or their other goodies.  I don&rsquo;t think a real conservative politician would either.  </p>

		<p>Other than self-promoting grand-standing and the obvious race-baiting, why not let these municipalities go it alone?  Quickly enough the private sector would trun away from doing business with them, and the hollow retirement benefits would prove all but fraudulent as the hapless retirees find out the cupboard is bare.  Does he think allowing these towns to go it the same path they have been failing at that things will magically get better?  Or is he hinting to stay away BUT SEND MORE MONEY to perpetuate the sham of government.</p>

<p>No doubt that statement is correct.  But of course Detroit&rsquo;s public schools at all other times have been run by the city, with equally dismal results.  Given the feral students that that school system is stuck with dismal results are all anybody will ever get.</p>

		<p>Yes New Jersey has some loopholes, as do most states for extension.  But Michigan is the only one where you can get on welfare, do nothing, and stay on until you die.  Former Gov. Granholm always promised to end it while campaigning, but never put it into action.  </p>
<p>Long story short, it all needs to be cut down to around 24 months with no exceptions for extensions.  And no &#8220;raises&#8221; for anyone that gives birth while on it.</p>
<p>Lastly, hang in there Jen.  I am in the same boat and as soon as I finish grad school (less than a year) I am gone.  Not sure where, but anywhere but here.  Wish I knew you, I could probably help you get a job.  Hang in there and leave as soon as you can.</p>

		<p>Of course it will target black communities. But it is not unfair. Take Detroit as the largest example. The city, mostly black, where more than 1/3 are on welfare and 1/3 work for the city. Majority of residents produce nothing and the city government is full of criminals. What do you expect? Detroit has been surviving off federal and state hand outs. Guess what? The party is over!</p>
