			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fox News, March 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>An Oregon school bus driver fired after he refused to remove a Confederate battle flag flying from his pickup truck has enlisted the help of a conservative civil liberties group in hopes of getting his job back.</p>
<p>The Rutherford Institute of Charlottesville, Va., sent a letter Wednesday to First Student Bus Transportation Services demanding that Ken Webber of Medford be reinstated. The institute said flying the flag on the pickup truck while it was parked at the bus yard was protected by Webber&rsquo;s First Amendment right to free speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Webber said he was fired Tuesday for gross insubordination after refusing for the second time to take the flag off his CB antenna while parked in the bus yard in Talent, which is owned by the Phoenix-Talent School District.</p>
<p>&#8220;The flag&rsquo;s flying,&#8221; he said from Medford.</p>
<p>Phoenix-Talent schools Superintendent Ben Bergreen had demanded the flag be removed from school property, citing a policy prohibiting symbols that could be offensive to minorities.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Married with four children, Webber has maintained the flag is not a political or racist statement, but an expression of his &#8220;redneck&#8221; identity, also expressed in a tattoo on his left arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re doing the best we can,&#8221; Webber said of the financial hardship the loss of his job means to his family. &#8220;I must say, my 8-year-old makes me proud. She took my picture from the Mail Tribune (newspaper) to school for show and tell. She was telling the kids in her class, &#8216;This is my dad standing up for what he believes in and I&rsquo;m proud of him for that.&#8221;&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The Confederate battle is the flag chosen by Confederate veterans to be displayed on their monuments and graves. The sons of Confederate veterans were given that task. Only this group has the right to determine what this banner stands for. </p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know where &#8220;Ken&#8221; gets the idea that the SCV has sole proprietorship over the Confederate flag. The SCV has often wimped out of Southern heritage fights over fears of being called racist. (I have witnessed this myself Ken. Don&rsquo;t say it never happened.) The SCV treats the Confederate flag as a historic artifact and not a symbol of Southern pride for millions of Southerners who are not history buffs. </p>
<p>The Confederate flag represents a continuum of Southern history and culture, and is not the property of the graveyard caretakers of the SCV or any other organization. The CofCC has done as much or more to defend Southern heritage and honor as the SCV&hellip; and for living Confederates as well as the noble dead ones.  </p>

		<p>Well, I&rsquo;m torn, but not really.  The First Amendment was never intended to be used as a defense in this way.  Notice it begins &#8220;Congress shall make no law&hellip;&#8221;  The school should have the right to fire who they want, it is their perogative.</p>
<p>However, if this were an issue where a lesbian coerced students to learn and support gay marriage, or where a black made whites feel offended by dressing up in Black Panther gear, we would hear about misconstrued civil and constitutional rights from the left.  I feel a society should be allowed to discriminate against ideas and people it doesn&rsquo;t like or accept.  Does this mean sometimes whites wearing the Confederate flag will be fired unfairly?  Yes.  But this will also allow white conservatives to freely prevent unqualified minorities and sexual deviants from acquiring positions of authority as well, because &#8220;discrimination&#8221; can no longer be a factor in sensical hiring/firing decisions made by local offcials.</p>

		<p>The current furor over the Confederate Battle Flag has only been going on for about 20-25 years. I have seen pictures of Southern sports teams who proudly used the flag as well as use in advertising and several state flags using the design. If you look at pictures of K rallies and other groups like this you will see th US flag used far more until fairly recently. In the early 20&rsquo;s during the heyday of the K there were more members in OH and IN than in states in the south. These groups hijacked the flag from historical groups like the sons of Confederate veterans and United Daughters of the Confederacy.</p>

<p>I guess symbols that offend whites are OK. </p>
<p>Hey news for you Ben, <b>minorities are offended by everything!!</b>   </p>
<p>Old Bergreen is your typical mind corrected, scared, brainwashed, overpaid white fool. </p>
<p>The flag incident presented a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; for discussions about a significant chapter in American history and how a group of ordinary citizens took up arms against tyranny. Also the opportunity presented itself for lessons on the first amendment and the real reason for second amendment.  </p>
<p>But,wait,&hellip;.I&rsquo;m sorry, my mistake, this is a school. Forgive me.  </p>
<p>The bus driver began to back away immediately when he said the flag was not a political statement.  I used to be one of the &#8220;heritage not hate&#8221; crowd too, but not anymore.  I fly the battle flag as a symbol of racial solidarity and to make the political statement that at one time whites had guts to stand against tyranny.</p>
<p>Phoenix-Talent school main website shows three individuals on its banner, one black, one Hispanic and one white. The latter is presumably a teacher. The black and the teacher are female.     </p>
<p>Phoenix Oregon is almost 90 percent white.  According to the census there are almost too few blacks to count.  So who would be offended? Where is the white proportional representation on the website?</p>
<p>I noticed that the high school web photo album showed two pictures of young white boys dressed in cheerleader uniforms for the powderpuff football game. Sick, but I guess they are training for the modern Army.</p>
<p>I suggest Ken Webber the bus driver fly the tri-color banner of the NWR instead if he wants to see Bergreen really freak out. </p>

<p>Flag burning is considered &#8220;speech&#8221; by the current regime and a right protected by the First Amendment.  But that is only for American flags.  Displaying the Southern Cross or the Stars and Stripes, and only these two, is banned from from the bus yard, all other flags and stickers are OK, as long as they represent hatred of whites   &mdash;   the rainbow gay rag, the Mexican or Aztlan flag, African flags, or any other power symbol from LaRaza, MenCha or other white-hating organization are OK.</p>
<p>Good Luck Mr. Webber.  I expect you will not win, probably in the name of &#8220;Private Property&#8221; and &#8220;Inciting Hatred.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Force is not with you on this one.</p>

		<p>  Does the school District or Oregon have a policy prohibiting<br>
symbols offensive to whites ?<br>
  If the policy only forbids symbols offensive to minorities then it is on its face discriminitory against whites and would appear to violate many Federal laws.<br>
  Can anyone post a copy of the whole policy ?</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s what bother me more than anything. If there is to be a ban on symbols then ban all such symbols. No African flags and not Mexican flags and no Israel flags. </p>
<p>If there was a rule that no flags or bumper stickers were allowed then I think I could deal with such a rule. But who&rsquo;s to say that one symbol represents any more hate than another? It&rsquo;s really just depends on how a person feels about any symbol. I get offended every time I see a person walk around with their pants hanging down around their knees but I don&rsquo;t make a big stink about it because I think people have a right to live and dress in any way that doesn&rsquo;t harm another person. </p>

		<p>This whole thing about minorities being &#8220;offended&#8221; by flags is now being extended to the American flag. If you remember a few months ago a boy was told to remove his American flag from his bicycle since it &#8220;offended&#8221; the Mexican students at his school! At another school a boy was suspended for removing a Mexican flag and at yet a third school a kid was sent home for wearing a tshirt with an American flag on Cinco de Mayo! </p>

I fly the battle flag as a symbol of racial solidarity and to make the political statement that at one time whites had guts to stand against tyranny.&#8221;  I have started to wear a Bonnie Blue Flag lapel pin from time to time; it&rsquo;s mostly for me, as a reminder of how to live, as few recognize its historical significance.<br>

<p><br>
You&rsquo;re absolutely right.  Political correctness dominated the cultural battlefield during the Clinton era of the 1990&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s when this all began.</p>
<p>Previously, nobody would have dared object to a truly American symbol.  The &#8216;Confederate Flag&rsquo; was everywhere in the 1970&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.  The combative Southern rock band &#8216;Lynard Skynard&rsquo; used to display a huge one at their concerts, in defiant pride.</p>

		<p>I appreciate the posts here and agree wholeheartedly with most. A Latino officer at the state prison that I work at was fired for supplying prisoners with drugs NOT because he had &ldquo;Brown Pride&rdquo; tattooed on his hands and MS-13 gang tattoos on his neck. Those were overlooked.  It will be interesting to see the reaction of the African American supervisors at my facility when I show up one of these sunny days with a fresh new Confederate flag wrapped around my forearm and White Pride tattooed into that. If I&rsquo;m looked at crooked, I&rsquo;ll sue the entire state into another galaxy. What should I name my new prison?</p>

		<p>I belong to the League of the South, and we encourage people to fly the 3rd National Confederate Flag, of which few folks outside of the states of the former Confederacy are even aware of.  Yes, we desire independence for the former Southern Confederacy, as well as ALL our sister states to be free from the American Empire and it&rsquo;s wholesale tyranny!  On another note, the Confederate Battle Flag is known around the world as a symbol of resistance to tyranny.  It was seen at the fall of the Berlin Wall and Sudanese rebel forces battling the communist government have carried it.  </p>
