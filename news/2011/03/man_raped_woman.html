<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A JEALOUS Indian man who tied up and raped a young woman to ruin her for any other man has been jailed for at least five years.</p>
<p>Ajay Pal Singh Thiara, 26, was jailed for six years and eight months in the District Court of South Australia today and will be deported when he finishes his sentence.</p>
<p>Judge David Smith gave him a five year non-parole period because Thiara would face retribution in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;I take into account that there may be more shame and retribution in store for you on your return home to India at the end of your sentence but that is of small solace in comparison to what you have done,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thiara raped the woman in December 2009 because he was angry and jealous when she went off to meet a suitor her family had arranged for her to marry, Judge Smith said.</p>
<p>He got drunk then proclaimed his love for her, abused her, tied her up, indecently assaulted and raped her.</p>
<p>She was a virgin who did not immediately report him to police because she felt ashamed and defiled.</p>
<p>But that changed after he assaulted her again in February 2010, stripping her naked and filming it on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>The judge said Thiara&rsquo;s excuse was that he was in love and did not want to lose the woman, a Sikh who would now find it very difficult to find a husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your intention, you said, was to ruin her so that no other man would want her,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>The rape was violent and protracted, shameful and degrading, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You deliberately defiled this young woman out of abject selfishness and jealousy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have shamed her, her family, yourself and your family.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is apparently a risk of some kind of form of retribution in India and in particular an honour killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thiara came to Australia with his wife and worked as a taxi driver while studying.<br>

		<p>The 3rd World barbarism never ends. A couple of nights ago, a woman was raped on one of the main streets of our city. She went out to buy a pizza and was raped in the front hallway of her own apartment building by some stranger who followed her home. Of course since there is no description of the attacker, everyone knows he is either black or hispanic. </p>
<p>A couple of young women I know were traveling by train late at night in the UK back in the late 1980s. On the train they were surrounded by Pakistani men and feared that they were on the verge of being raped. They managed to escape unharmed when the Pakistani were driven off by a group of skinheads! The story has a somewhat funny side in that both girls were politically liberal and as PC as you could get. I had to inwardly chuckle when they told me their tale of woe.</p>

		<p>I am kind of curious:</p>
<p>When he was raping her, who was minding the Front Desk at the motel?</p>

<p>6 years for a kidnapping and a rape?  And this judge has the gall to carry on about how atrocious the crime was?</p>
<p>If he murdered the woman, I suspect this same legal dreg would hand out a full ten years, with time off for good behavior.</p>
<p>And if a white person came in front of him who burned a Koran or slandered Islam, I suspect he would mete out something like 40 years.</p>
<p>At least that would be the norm in this country.</p>
<p>The West is finished, and thank God for it.  It has spawned too many white egghead types who are absolute fools.</p>

		<p>6 years for two rapes? Does that mean that after 6 years she will no longer suffer emotional damage from those rapes? </p>
<p>What a ridiculously light sentence. And he won&rsquo;t even do all of the six years. </p>
<p>Rapists should be castrated!</p>

		<p>The skinheads should not have wasted their time and effort to help those women. The sort of people that think multiculturalism, diversity and allowing unlimited immigration of undesireable third world rabble are the ones that need a reality check the most, and if they got gang raped by those Pakistanis, if that is what it takes to get them to see the error of their screwed up thinking processes, so be it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d bet those two liberal train riders in UK were more afraid of the skinheads than they were of the Pakistanis.  After all, that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve been taught all their lives.  Imagine their shock when the skinheads drove off the would be rapists.  But did they learn anything?  Probably not.  More and more I am convinced liberals and the PC crowd are the brain dead with heart beats.<br>

<p>You said &#8220;if they got gang raped by those Pakistanis, if that is what it takes to get them to see the error of their screwed up thinking processes, so be it.&#8221; I find that position untenable. Women should be protected. And maybe even liberal women will connect the dots: The diversity was about to rape them, and racially aware white men protected them. Maybe racially aware white men are not evil, and diversity is not a strength. </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the Sharia Law rape case. Some liberal judge might side whith the perp as a way of &#8220;understanding&#8221; third world cultures.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker: once he finishes his jail term (probably will only serve a couple of years), he won&rsquo;t have to go back to India because he will fear persecution and that would undermine his &#8220;civil rights&#8221;. Bingo - refugee status in any of our ridiculous doomed western countries. </p>

		<p>To posters 2 and 8, he wouldn&rsquo;t care if you burned a quran because he is a sikh.  It is a different religion, not islam.  It&rsquo;s just a lot of people from over there, hindu, sikh, whatever, are very low in their values.</p>
