<h1>Asians Aim For &#8216;Ya Es Hora&rsquo;-Style Citizenship Push</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Taxin, San Francisco Chronicle, March 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Inspired by a highly publicized Latino naturalization drive, Asian Americans are fanning out to help immigrants across California  &mdash;  and eventually the country  &mdash;  become U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Asian American advocates say getting more immigrants to naturalize is crucial to flex the political muscle of the state&rsquo;s fastest-growing ethnic group and give the community a louder voice. And it has become even more pressing since the country ramped up immigration enforcement, making citizenship a requirement to get more government contracts and to avoid deportation if convicted of a crime.</p>
<p>The task is daunting. In California  &mdash;  home to a third of the country&rsquo;s Asian population  &mdash;  dozens of languages are spoken, in addition to dozens of dialects, and myriad often-competing Asian-language media outlets reach diverse segments.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The campaign  &mdash;  which starts next week with a workshop in the San Gabriel Valley&rsquo;s sizable Chinese and Vietnamese communities  &mdash;  is modeled after the &#8220;Ya es hora&#8221; citizenship campaign launched by a close-knit partnership between community groups, Spanish-language media giant Univision and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.</p>
<p>That program, which consists of in-person workshops broadcast on television, has helped nearly 40,000 people fill out their naturalization applications and nearly 100,000 get their citizenship questions answered via a bilingual hotline since 2007.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Under the program, Asian-American advocates will host six large-scale workshops across California to offer free assistance in multiple languages filling out naturalization forms. The goal is to initially help several hundred immigrants apply for citizenship, and have local community organizations help hundreds more after getting training from immigration lawyers on how to process the paperwork, said Connie Choi, an attorney with APALC&rsquo;s immigrant rights project.</p>
<p>California is home to about 5 million Asians who account for about 13 percent of the state&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>Advocates hope to eventually expand the effort to other states with large Asian communities such as Texas, Georgia, Nevada and Ohio, said Karen Narasaki, president of the Washington-based Asian American Justice Center, an APALC affiliate.</p>
<p>Asian immigrants are already more likely to naturalize than Latinos and more than 60 percent become U.S. citizens within a decade of getting a green card, according to 2005 statistics from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Janelle Wong, a political science professor at the University of Southern California, said once Asian immigrants naturalize, they are relatively high-propensity voters. They are also more likely to get involved in politics in other ways, for example, by contacting their elected officials.</p>
<p>One of the challenges to getting a naturalization or civic engagement campaign off the ground in the Asian-American community is that immigrants often identify more closely with their distinct ethnic background, and often care about different issues, she said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Asian immigrants have shown a strong interest in learning how to become citizens, though many are skeptical about asking questions of the U.S. government. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons federal authorities rely on community organizations trusted by immigrant communities to help promote naturalization, said Jane Arellano, district director for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is how we reach our ethnic communities,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They trust their leadership.&#8221;<br>

		<p>As I noted in a prior post, in the U.S. the conflict is not between tired old Gringos and brave ambitious hispanics. Rather it involves other groups which are also anxious to get a big slice of American pie. Asians only have 1/3 the population of the hispanics, but there are many more Asians ready and willing to colonize the land of opportunity. Also the Asians are more intelligent, better organized, and better financed than the braggadocio hispanics. </p>

		<p>Every Asian who enters America is one more vote for the race-replacement-street by street,town by town,County by County and State by State-of the Native Born White Majority.</p>
<p>There are no economic,demographic and ecological reasons for importing even one Asian into America.</p>
<p>Since I mentioned that there is no ecological reason for importing legal Asian  immigrants consider this:One legal Asian immigrant introduced one pregnant giant snakehead fish into the Potomac. Now the state of Virginia&rsquo;s river system is being ecologically destabilized&hellip;and hundreds more snakehead fish are being introduced into river systems throughout America by who knows how many Asian legal immigrants.</p>

<p>Well there you have it.  Non-whites are able to publicly proclaim that they should vote as a racial bloc, and are proud of it, and others are expected to accept it.  But whites must never, ever voice the same desire.</p>

		<p>Why didn&rsquo;t they &#8220;flex their political muscle&#8221; when they were in their own countries? I guess imagining their headless body in a ditch pretty well kept the muscle flexing to a minimum &#8216;over there&rsquo;.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it something that they&rsquo;re as quiet a church mouse in their countries but once they come here they suddenly grow a pair and demand &#8220;their rights&#8221;! </p>

		<p>The article says that Asians are afraid to ask questions of government officials. This is what the race replacement programs are about. Whites ask questions and demand an efficient government and non-whites don&rsquo;t. If you part of the elite who would you rather have?</p>

		<p>Asians are the invisible race, and not by accident. Asian abuse the immigration system, they petition their family to the US, then sign them up for welfare, playing the system for every penny.  They are far more accomplished at welfare fraud than blacks, being smarter than blacks, and being under the radar.  Another area where asians excel is tax evasion. Restaurants, nail salons and other popular asian businesses are cash intensive, and owners and employees never report all the cash the business generates. </p>

		<p>East Asians are hoping we don&rsquo;t notice.  Unfortunately, most white people won&rsquo;t notice because they rather focus exclusively on those that commit petty crime and live off welfare instead of those that are swamping our colleges (which then leads to high-paying jobs in turn leading to better mating success and the ability to afford a larger family) and streaming into this country non-stop.  East Asians rather other people do the heavy lifting and eventually they will stroll in and take advantage of the labor and knowledge.  They are piggybacking off of Latinos efforts to break down America&rsquo;s borders like they have piggybacked off America&rsquo;s education system, piggybacked off of European know-how to build the countries they currently have etc.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Asian immigrants are already more likely to naturalize than Latinos and more than 60 percent become U.S. citizens within a decade of getting a green card, according to 2005 statistics from the Department of Homeland Security.&#8221;<br>
This is why Japanese fleeing Japan after the disasters there are concerning, they will not leave.  Another thing the Fukushima nuclear disaster has shown is white people are irreplaceable.  After the diesel generators, which supplied power to the water pumps that cooled the spent fuel rods, at the plant were destroyed by a tsunami, it took the Japanese a week and the intervention of the white man to tell them they need to restore power to the pumps.  If it&rsquo;s not in a manual or hasn&rsquo;t been down a million times before East Asians don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>

		<p>What goes on here in Queens, and in the rest of NYC is unreal.  Elderly immigrants on SSI, not having worked a day in the US.  Younger &#8220;disabled&#8221; on SSI.  Large families using food stamp cards and WIC.  Anytime I&rsquo;m in a doctor&rsquo;s office or at the local hospital EVERYONE has a Medicaid card. That comes with free transportation.  Public housing, and public housing for the elderly.  Cash businesses all over my neighborhood.  Formerly white majority schools majority Asian.  Store after store in Flushing and Bayside with Chinese/Korean signs.  Anchor babies.  I can&rsquo;t take it anymore.  <br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised Asians are scamming the system. They don&rsquo;t have to. <br>
Most are self-reliant. How come I don&rsquo;t see them in the public housing projects? They are complex tho. Some time ago in Houston an incident at a convenience store raised questions in my mind. Some black yutes, doing what comes naturally, stole some beer and ran away. The young male Asian clerk ran after them and caused some injury. The blacks, again predictably, demonstrated and got TV exposure complaining that the Asian over-reacted. This was clear-cut nonsense. However, the Asians humbly apologized. The worthless black mob drove away business and the business closed. This same story has been repeated many times in the convenience store business i.e. blacks murdering Asians. They make good victims seems like.</p>

<p>No NO and NO</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely mixed up!  Asians see the proverbial writing on the wall in California and are demanding THEIR share of the racial spoils from the few remaining whites left in the state.  </p>
<p>APALC =  Asian Pacific American Legal Center.  Only concerned with Asians, not mexicans unless it&rsquo;s to rid California of every last one of them.</p>
<p>Asians know that unless they act NOW they will soon be lorded over by low IQd mowers of lawns and washers of dishes, those who drop out of school so they can live off the largess of those who work for a living.  </p>
<p>Asians, unlike us whites, will have none of it!  They have no intention of supporting blacks and mexicans who breed indiscriminately and demand to be taken care of cradle to grave.  They, unlike us whites, are impervious to accusations of racism and don&rsquo;t fall for the lies of multi-culturalism&hellip; or freedom for that matter</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll take care of the blacks and mexicans first and then us. </p>
<p>These people mean us great harm.</p>
<p>Got it?</p>

		<p>Asian immigrants want to become citizens, but keep their culture and language. If they want to vote and can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t read and speak English, no problem. San Francisco voters ballots come in several Asian languages and of course Spanish. I never understood how a voting American needs a ballot in any language other than English.</p>

		<p>following up on my 9:03 post, here are 2 posts from a chinese women on SFGate&rsquo;s (SF chronicle)comment board, she was complaining about immigrants having to learn english, she has deleted her posts after realizing her faux pax, but I saved them, <br>
here they are:</p>
<p>&#8221; BTW, many Asians choose to come to the US specifically to retire at age 65, where they are guaranteed SSI and Medicare/Medi-Cal. They hide their savings/assets in Chinese bank accounts and it is too hard for the US to read Chinese characters/pinyin and get the names/transliteration/spelling right, so they would never be able to verify foreign accounts in China anyway (everyone is named Lee or Yee or Chiang or Wu/Woo/Ou).They consider the $845 per person monthly SSI as their vacation or &#8220;gambling&#8221; money.&#8221;</p>
<p>and this little gem from the same woman:</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandparents came to the US from Taiwan around age 65 so they could enroll in the SSI program, which pays all elderly California residents $845 a month now, as well as Medicare and Med-Cal. They are both US citizens, now, but how do you expect them to learn English after speaking Taiwanese and Japanese (due to the Japanese occupation in WWII) all their lives? That&rsquo;s a ridiculous requirement at their age.&#8221;</p>
<p>as for the author of the above,  she stated that at age 21 she started collecting SS disability ins, (she is 41 today),  and one of her parents also collects SSDI.</p>
<p>I personally know a vietnamese refugee who owns 2 homes in n.ca, @$750k ea. one paid off, the 2nd almost paid off. meanwhile his mother,(who he petitioned to the US w/his sisters) lives in a $2000/mo condo for free courtesy of the US taxpayers. one sister owns a small business and she under reports her income by a factor of 10, the 2nd sister and husband work under the table and collect welfare/section 8. the 3rd sister is paid by the state of california to take care of the mother.  <br>
 so while this vietnamese man is living the good life with his wife and kids, The US taxpayers are supporting the rest of his family. an educated guess of the total amount? $6000/mo. not including medical costs, as his mother has all kinds of health problems</p>
<p>next time you see that old asian woman driving her BMW,  remember, you are probably making the payments!<br>

		<p>Asians commit violent crimes at about one quarter the white rate&hellip;<br>
 <br>
High arrest and incarceration rates for blacks and Hispanics &mdash; and very low rates for Asians &mdash; reflect differences in crime rates, not police or justice system bias&hellip;<br>
 <br>
In total, blacks had the highest incarceration rate at 7.2 times the white rate, followed by Hispanics, at 2.9 times the white rate&hellip; and Asians at only 22 percent <br>
of the white rate&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Blacks are considerably more likely than any other group to commit crimes of virtually all kinds, while Asians are least likely&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Blacks are about eight times more likely than whites to commit murder, and 25 times more likely than Asians to do so. Blacks are 15 times more likely than whites to go to prison for robbery,<br>
and 50 times more likely than Asians&hellip;<br>

		<p>Modern science shows a three-way pattern of race differences in both physical traits and behavior. On average, Orientals are slower to mature, less fertile, less sexually active, less aggressive, and have larger brains and higher IQ scores&hellip;<br>
 <br>
For the past twenty years I have studied race differences in brain size, intelligence, sexuality, personality, growth rate, life span, crime, and family stability. On all of these traits, Orientals fall at one end of the spectrum, Blacks fall at the other end, and Whites fall in between&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Orientals are a &ldquo;model minority.&rdquo; They have fewer divorces, fewer out-of-wedlock births, and fewer reports of child abuse than Whites. More Orientals graduate from college and fewer go to prison&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Orientals are under-represented in U.S. crime statistics. This has led some to argue that the Asian &ldquo;ghetto&rdquo; has protected members from harmful outside influences. For Blacks, however, the ghetto is said to foster crime, so purely cultural explanations are not enough&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Racial differences in personality and obeying rules also show up in divorce rates, out of wedlock births, child abuse, and delinquency. Orientals are more successful than Whites or Blacks. They have fewer divorces, fewer out of wedlock births, and less child abuse than Whites&hellip;<br>
 <br>
Around the world, Blacks have the highest crime rate, Orientals the least&hellip; Orientals are the most willing to delay gratification.<br>

<p> I do know about how they cheat the system and take all the freebies they can get their hands on!  SSI/SSA and welfare and not reporting their assests that they have hidden. Also about their elderly coming here to suck us dry even more. They are a crafty people just like all the other nonwhite leeches that hate White people and their nations! <br>

I agree with you that MOST Asians in the U.S. are self-interested (as any group should be) and not members of the small, very vocal left that pushes the interests of low-IQ minorities.  Any Asian who does not is no different, in this respect, than whites who do the same.</p>

		<p>The more I see the way Non-Whites are gravy-training onto the system, the more I think Whites need to adapt their own Cloward-Piven before our numbers diminish to the point of it being too late and we are nothing more than an oppressed Helot minority slave rade to the others.  </p>
<p>I am convinced that any White who does not hop on the gravy train RIGHT NOW and try to soak our treacherous government for every penny he can is an idiot.  There is absolutely no reason for US to limit our families and have fewer children so we can then turn around and finance Non-White families through our taxes.  </p>
<p>Anyone White young enough to have children needs to have at least four or more to get that EITC benefit, etc.  We need to take entire chapters out of the Asian playbook ourselves so we can hold our treacherous politicians&rsquo; feet to the fire and made them squeal.</p>

		<p>With so many non-English speaking US citizens already naturalized, I suppose it&rsquo;s too late to make having a good knowledge of English a requirement for US citizenship. In some countries, like Germany, you have to pass a language test in order to become a citizen. If an immigrant doesn&rsquo;t understand the language spoken in his new home, how can he understand the political situation enough to vote? Also, many immigrants want to change their adopted countries. If they&rsquo;re not mostly content with the country the way that it is, they shouldn&rsquo;t move there.    </p>

<p>What is your point? That Native Born White Americans were worse off when Asians weren&rsquo;t in America? Anyone who claims this is telling a bold-face lie.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what the IQ average of Asians is..nor do I care about Mexican average IQ. It is completely irrelevant to the fundamental issue of race-replacement. I have no interests in microscopic genetic arguments for and against nonwhite immigration. It is not that  genes are unimportant. But for the battle against race-replacement, all that it is needed is gut-level racial triblalism&hellip;Native Born White Americans understand this. This is why I would never use a term such as &#8220;Korean American&#8221;..a group that votes for the race-replacement of Native Born Americans at election time-every time&hellip;they are Koreans in &#8220;America&#8221;. I don&rsquo;t recognize the legitimacy of Koreans or any other Asian ethnic group in America.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans managed to put twelve Native Born White Alpha Males-tests pilots of advanced military aircraft with PHDs and masters degrees in engineering-on the moon. And the institution-NASA-responsible for putting these twelve Alpha Native Born White American Males on the moon was demographically 99 percent Native Born White American Male. There is absolutely no national(Native Born White Ameriacan variety) need-economic,technological,demographic and ecological-to import one Asian legal immigrant into America..never was. </p>

<p>What you state (which most of us here already know) doesn&rsquo;t mean we should welcome Asians into our society to race-replace us.</p>
<p>We were doing fine without them, our white American culture advanced and with relatively low crime rates.  How did we ever manage to put men on the moon or create the most advanced technological society ever on the face of the planet without all those &#8220;brilliant&#8221; Asian and Indian scientists?</p>
<p>How about they stay in their own countries and help their own people instead of race-replacing us in our homelands?  Or are you OK with Asians race-replacing white Americans?</p>

		<p>don&rsquo;t get complacent about asians in america, the are the &#8220;model minority&#8221; and under the radar not because of some higher principle, but because they don&rsquo;t want to draw attention to themselves, they want to stay out of the sunshine. The fact is they are more than willing to shamelessly game our welfare system, they are more than willing to shamelessly game our immigration system, and the have shown numerous times that they are more than willing to sell out their white employers and the white country they live in for the benefit of their homeland. Sure they may project an appearance of honor and character, but it is only for their compatriots, when it comes to america and YT, it&rsquo;s screw them and get as much as possible, any way possible. </p>

		<p>One reason it is critical that whites begin to speak out for their interests is that it puts semi-friendly groups such as asians on notice that harm is done to us by various government policies and that they cannot claim to be innocent with support of such policies.  If asians want to support affirmative action then they harm whites.  If they support mass immigration, they harm whites.  If they support massive government social spending, they harm whites, etc.  There is a good chance they don&rsquo;t care but at least there is a price to be paid.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;As I noted in a prior post, in the U.S. the conflict is not between tired old Gringos and brave ambitious hispanics. Rather it involves other groups which are also anxious to get a big slice of American pie. Asians only have 1/3 the population of the hispanics, but there are many more Asians ready and willing to colonize the land of opportunity. Also the Asians are more intelligent, better organized, and better financed than the braggadocio hispanics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Great post.  We&rsquo;re seeing now that Asians are pushing whites out of prestigious universities and high paying jobs.  Because they are more intelligent than blacks and Hispanics, they will be able to take power away from whites in ways that low IQ groups can&rsquo;t.  The elite in America is already very heavily Jewish and will become heavily Asian in the near future.  Whites are not going to keep political control of the country even after becoming a minority as some have suggested.  </p>

		<p>To poster #10 I see the same things everyday.  I feel like I live in Asia now.  I hardly ever, EVER see a white face around here.  For that matter, I don&rsquo;t see latino or black faces that much, though more than white faces.  Asians push out the blacks first.  They keep the latinos at bay and they tolerate us whites as we die off and they scoop up our homes.</p>
<p>To poster 19, I wonder the same thing all the time.</p>

		<p>15 John Engleman: The Black murder rate was 11 times the White rate for decades, and the Hispanic murder rate 5+ times the White rate.  The new rates of 8X and 3X come from counting Hispanic criminals as White.  For an example, check the FBI&rsquo;s hate crime stats.  There are Hispanic victims of hate crimes, but no Hispanic perpetrators.   <br>
     Furthermore, crimes among Chinese are greatly underreported.  The gangs rob their own, and will kill victims who call the cops.  White cops in towns with lots of Chinese know about the gangs, but nobody will ever testify in court.  Their criminals are simply better disciplined than other races&rsquo;.  </p>

		<p>I have a 1/2 Chinese/Vietnamese friend in San Jose, Ca. He tells me about his Vietnamese buddies who bull their way into tech companies, clean them out, and can&rsquo;t do the work. Especially they like to get into management jobs so they can make sure only others of their same race get hired. Indians do the same thing. It&rsquo;s little more than a big organized crime racket and takeover attempt. They infiltrate and clean out our companies and throw the Americans who created the companies out. Then they proceed to rob the company blind. Incompetents are deliberately left in jobs they can&rsquo;t do because they think ol evil whitey owes them for centuries of oppression. Once the company collapses, they move on to the next one. And now we wonder why our own economy has collapsed? It&rsquo;s the immigrants stupid.</p>

Same thing with Fillipino nurses.  In the Fillipines the last year of nurse&rsquo;s training is a stint as manager of a neighborhood health clinic.  So as soon as they graduate they have a year of management experience on their resume.  With that experience and affirmative action they get management jobs.  And within a few years every nurse in the facility is either an extended family member or a graduate of their nursing school back in the Fillipines.</p>
