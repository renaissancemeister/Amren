	<p>First-generation West African immigrants from Nigeria and Ghana transition smoothly into major societal institutions, such as the workplace and the neighborhood, but have not built stable, mutually beneficial friendships and intimate relationships with native-born Americans, said Northeastern University professor Mindelyn Buford II.</p>
<p>Speaking at an interdisciplinary conference, &#8220;American Identity in the Age of Obama,&#8221; held last week at Northeastern, the assistant professor of sociology and African-American studies noted that Nigerian and Ghanaian immigrants &#8220;exhibit patterns of selective acculturation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There&rsquo;s not an easy answer to what aspects of American identity have or have not changed since Obama was elected,&#8221; said political science professor Amilcar Barreto, associate director of the Humanities Center. &#8220;It&rsquo;s possible that any change is slow in terms of accepting members of traditionally marginalized groups in society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buford analyzed the socioeconomic and interpersonal assimilation patterns of 45 Nigerian and Ghanaian immigrants who migrated to Maryland, many of whom sought better jobs and educational opportunities. She is conducting the research for a book on how class and race shape highly educated, foreign-born black immigrants&rsquo; assimilation trajectories in the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The majority of participants, Buford said, enjoyed their experiences in the workplace and in the neighborhood, but seldom developed close relationships with their co-workers or neighbors. More often than not, for example, Nigerian and Ghanaian immigrants developed formal work relationships that &#8220;did not tend to extend outside of the workplace and work hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patterns of integration or isolation among these new immigrants have implications for their self-identity and imposed identification in contemporary U.S. society,&#8221; said Buford.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve &#8220;transitioned smoothly&#8221; into &#8220;the workplace and the neighborhood&#8221; because the big government big business colossus forces us to accept them.  Because they can&rsquo;t force us to be friends and lovers with them, that is why we have not yet become their friends and lovers.  Just wait   &mdash;   That&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>I notice this was based on a study of 45 (yes, count &#8216;em, all of 45) Nigerians and Ghanians in Maryland.  I&rsquo;m guessing Baltimore, and probably they live in the black section of Baltimore.  That said, the &#8220;native born Americans&#8221; there are black, and yet they don&rsquo;t seem to have embraced their &#8220;brothers.&#8221;  If the parts of Maryland they live are not black, then they&rsquo;re almost likely to be surrounded by liberal Democrat-voting whites who say they love diversity, but don&rsquo;t want to be friends with it or bed down with it.</p>

		<p>I deal with Nigerians on a professional basis, and in confidence, they admit that they have little to do with american blacks for the same reasons we do. Crime, ignorance and in their case, jealousy. The issues here are a two way street.  Nigerians, (the smarter ones I have met) look down on american blacks for making nothing of themselves for generations, while the Nigerians dream of getting here to seek a better life. American blacks don&rsquo;t like them either as the Nigerian successes only amplify their own failures. </p>
<p>Also be aware that the Nigerians who land here are the &#8216;cream of the crop&rsquo; in their country, IQ wise.  Given a choice, I&rsquo;d prefer Nigerian neighbors to our own home grown blacks.</p>

		<p>I have a Nigerian native in one of my grad classes.  I will say they are a lot better than their American brothers.  But one thing is for certain, they hate Americans.</p>
<p>They are polite and work harder than American blacks, but make no apology for coming over here and wanting to take over and marry a white girl.  They are trying by going to college and getting a job, not by forming gangs and screaming racism.  But these views are pretty much the same for every minority not born in the U.S.</p>
<p>This is just my experience and I cannot speak for all.  Plus, they HATE American blacks with a passion.  Native Africans believe American blacks are given a paradise and take everything for granted and ruin it for all the other hardworking blacks.</p>
<p>That I will agree on.</p>

		<p>Nigeria has one of the highest birthrates in Africa (therefore one of the highest in the world), especially after their standard of living went up dramatically after the oil boom there.  So much for the standard theory that birthrates drop when people get more education and/or income. It saddens me to see more Africans are allowed to emigrate here.  We still have lots of problems with the original ones! And they sure go for the &#8220;white tail&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I have also known many blacks direct from Africa, and can attest that they are so much more civilized in general.  I do take that with a grain of salt though because you can hardly pass a week without hearing of some horrible atrocity committed in Africa by angry rioters.</p>
<p>What this sloppy study is clearly showing, however, is that a unified American &#8216;mainstream&rsquo; is rapidly passing away into the dustbin of history.  This bodes ill for our nation, as people lead separate lives with little in common other than a nameless, faceless &#8216;government&rsquo; hovering over them to keep them in line.</p>
<p>100 years from now, the Unitied States will be no more.  All of you know it is true - and don&rsquo;t deny it.  This land will be made up of at least a dozen mini-countries that are by and large racially based.  The wars and famine will be terrible.  If only liberals knew what they&rsquo;ve done.</p>
<p>A wise man said never change a system without knowing what will replace it.  Can you believe that those liberals really think that they are building a black/brown paradise that will usher in an Avatar-like era of social justice and prosperity for all?</p>

		<p>It is almost an imposibility to describe the contempt African immigrants have for American born and bred blacks. Every stero-type you white devils believe they believe in spades doubled, redoubled, and vulnerable. The Africans I know send their daughters to Catholic schools and their sons to white prep schools. I hadn`t heard the n word in polite company since my last rap concert, but I heard it plenty when I invited three Africans from Ethiopia to a political fund raiser figh fry.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve had quite a bit of experience with Nigerians. Their educational backgrounds are often fraudulent and they themselves are notorious as scammers and con-artists. Some people think they&rsquo;re charming, especially with their accents, but that&rsquo;s just part of the con. If you&rsquo;re dealing in any way with Nigerians then beware; most are not what they seem to be. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right!  They&rsquo;ll have to be subtle,  b ut I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re working on it right now, searching for a way.  It won&rsquo;t be forced, but there will be subtle inducements:  tax incentives, scholarships, rent and mortgage reductions, promotional advantages, etc. </p>
<p>That will be the next step. It&rsquo;s coming.  We are like the frog in the pot, that is being slowly heated, bit by bit.</p>

<p>When I was studying I have met a lot of Africans too.<br>
What I can say about this elites of Africa is that they try to work hard. But many can&rsquo;t fool their genes. The first thing I noticed at my first day in the city was that they are far louder than any other group of none-whites. </p>
<p>However I didn&rsquo;t forget that they are mostly from the upper class of Africans and mostly their parents are the elite of Africa.</p>

Academic double-speak.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;exhibit patterns of selective acculturation.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Translation: African immigrants, just like their American counterpart, either won&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t be integrated by the choices they make or by their nature.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Patterns of integration or isolation among these new immigrants have implications for their self-identity and imposed identification in contemporary U.S. society,&rdquo; said Buford.</i></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see. They&rsquo;re unlikely to integrate if they stay isolated so they must be integrated. But being integrated means they lose their identity which is VITAL to minorities who need to know who they are &#8216;as a people&rsquo;. So if we integrate them, we have to be sure achieve &#8216;critical mass&rsquo;. Of course, when they have enough people like them around them, they don&rsquo;t have to integrate into the larger society&hellip;and on and on and on.</p>
<p>Bottom line, segregation it seems is both bad and good and this contradiction drives liberals mad. <br>

		<p>Blacks, as a group, tend to be self-hating and prone to the private condemnation of other blacks (though they seldom do so in a public forum).  Most American blacks exhibit extreme disdain for Africans, ascribing savage or even simian traits to them.  Middle-class blacks despise ghetto dwellers worse than they do any other group.  Low-class blacks hate other blacks because the latter is from a different block or another city.  A small dispute between two blacks can instantly erupt into a full-scale riot involving scores of people going for the kill.  Many blacks abuse their children and sexual partners and shoot one another over the merest slight.  <br>
The Somalis who now infest a previously peaceful New England town were all but run out of a Florida city by native-born blacks.  And, as others have noted, the hatred goes both ways.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you just posted Seneca the Younger! However, I would also submit that the Nigerians I have worked with in the muddled east are second only to Somalis as being the nastiest blacks I have worked with (perhaps second also to American blacks)</p>

<p>With characters like that in positions of authority, you have to wonder.</p>
<p>Yes, there&rsquo;s proof right there of the Long March Through the Institutions.  It has been accomplished, it&rsquo;s a fact,  and our major institutions are no longer ours. They have been &#8220;conquered&#8221; and taken from us, right under our noses&hellip; while we were being generous, fair, and non-discriminating.<br>

		<p>Speaking of Nigeria   &mdash;   People keep talking about Nigeria&rsquo;s great future.</p>
<p>I have my doubts, needless to say.  Let me give you a piece of anecdotal evidence relevant to right now.</p>
<p>The organization responsible for the Firefox web browser just released Firefox version 4.0.  It put up a world map ( http://glow.mozilla.org ) showing the download count, of those downloading the program from Mozilla&rsquo;s own servers and upgrading their existing Firefox installations.  The map approximates where people are downloading or upgrading Firefox at the moment you look at the map by plopping a glowing dot where someone is.  Since dozens of people are doing this every second, you&rsquo;ll see a lot of glowing dots appearing and disappearing.  And most of the &#8220;sparks&#8221; are either in the United States or Europe.</p>
<p>The map allows you to drill down to continent, country and sub-country (state/province) level stats.  I did, and at the time I checked yesterday, the whole country of Nigeria and the American state of Arkansas had about the same number of Firefox 4 downloads (just under 80,000).  Nigeria has about 152 million people, Arkansas just under 3 million.  So in those terms, the &#8220;future of the world&#8221; is about on par with the much-maligned &#8220;redneck hillbillies&#8221; of Arkansas (being mindful of the fact that AR is heavily black itself).</p>
