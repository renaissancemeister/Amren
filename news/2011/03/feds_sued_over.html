<h1>Feds Sued over Illegal-Immigrant Documents</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ben Giles, Washington Examiner, March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Prince William Board of County Supervisors sued the Department of Homeland Security for records on the agency&rsquo;s handling of an illegal immigrant who was released by federal officials and later charged with drunken driving in a car crash that killed a nun.</p>
<p>County officials argue that Homeland Security is unlawfully withholding records the Board of Supervisors requested about Carlos Martinelly-Montano, who Prince William County police turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement almost two years ago, according to a complaint filed in U.S. District Court on Tuesday.</p>
<p>ICE released Martinelly-Montano back into the community while he awaited his deportation hearing. He was charged in August 2010 with drunken driving in a fatal crash that killed one nun and left two others injured. He had two previous drunken-driving convictions.</p>
<p>At the time, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano ordered an investigation into the case in to discover why Martinelly-Montano was never deported.</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors filed a Freedom of Information Act request in November 2010 for copies of the investigation report and any other documents concerning the department&rsquo;s contact with him. DHS has failed to hand over the documents or indicate that the records are exempt from the request, according to county officials, and the board grew frustrated after trying for months to cooperate with DHS.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The board also has asked Congress to investigate Homeland Security&rsquo;s handling of all its immigration records. [Chairman Corey] Stewart has met with officials from the U.S. House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees, and said he hopes they will agree to conduct the investigation.</p>

		<p>Not easy to pick just one Fed agency better handled privately than currently the case.<br>
Would recommend Southern border security, ICE, and incarceration of illegal&rsquo;s apprehended be financed by &#8220;for profit&#8221;, privately run, humane, and safe, detention center networks, where daily labor is required until a term is served, at which time prisoners be returned to their country of origin. That country will have the option for non violent offenders be released promptly, but only after necessary fees are paid.</p>

		<p>Little to say since this is not new news.</p>
<p>Career politicians, to me, seem like they just throw random Bills out there so they can claim stupidity later and never &#8220;officially&#8221; put in ink what their goals are or their stances on issues.</p>
<p>Its like that hot-and-cold game you play when you hide something of a friend&rsquo;s as kids.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting warmer.</p>

		<p>I know from personal experience that the INS or whatever they call themselves don&rsquo;t mind taking false documents. No red flags get raised either. I told a lawyer I would report this to the INS and the lawyer said it would it would only result in this person getting citizenship. I&rsquo;m dumbfounded on this. I wish I knew someone who could help on that since so many lawyers are liberal pro legal/ illegal alien on this country. </p>
