<h1>Lawsuit Seeks Dissolution of Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, Johns Creek, Milton, Chattahoochee Hills</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Katie Leslie, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Georgia Legislative Black Caucus filed a lawsuit Monday against the state of Georgia seeking to dissolve the city charters of Dunwoody, Sandy Springs, Johns Creek, Milton and Chattahoochee Hills. Further, the lawmakers, joined by civil rights leader the Rev. Joseph Lowery, aim to dash any hopes of a Milton County.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in a North Georgia U.S. District Court Monday, claims that the state circumvented the normal legislative process and set aside its own criteria when creating the &#8220;super-majority white&#8221; cities within Fulton and DeKalb counties. The result, it argues, is to dilute minority votes in those areas, violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution.</p>
<p>&#8220;This suit is based on the idea that African Americans and other minorities can elect the people of their choice,&#8221; said Democratic State Sen. Vincent Fort.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Lynne Riley, R-Johns Creek, called the lawsuit &#8220;frivolous&#8221; and &#8220;disrespectful to the citizens of these cities who are most satisfied with their government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riley was active in creating Sandy Springs and the subsequent cities while serving as a Fulton County commissioner.</p>
<p>&#8220;These jurisdictions were based on geography and nothing else,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We haven&rsquo;t seen any evidence of any disadvantage based on the creation of new cities. We&rsquo;ve watched the Fulton County budget continue to grow &hellip; to say there was damage done by this creation, there are no facts to support that, and I would reject it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>According to the 2010 census, Fulton County is 44.5 percent white and 44.1 percent black. About 54 percent of DeKalb County residents are black, and 33.3 percent are white.</p>
<p>Sandy Springs, created in 2005, is 65 percent white and 20 percent black. Milton, formed a year later, is 76.6 percent white and 9 percent black. Johns Creek, also formed that year, is 63.5 percent white and 9.2 percent black. Chattahoochee Hills, formed in 2007, is 68.6 percent white and 28 percent black, while Dunwoody, created in 2008, is 69.8 percent white and 12.6 percent black.</p>
<p>Emory University law professor Michael Kang said the case is unique because the Voting Rights Act focuses on redistricting, whereas this lawsuit challenges the legality of cities. Kang, who has not reviewed the case in its entirety, said the plaintiffs will likely have to show evidence of discriminatory purpose to have a strong claim. Kane said the case has interesting implications.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we look at this realistically, there is some white flight going on. The creation of these Sandy Springs-type cities enables white voters to get away from black voters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It does strike me that the Voting Rights Act might have something to say about this, but it&rsquo;s unknown what the courts will say about it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>NOW they&rsquo;re going to the courts and whining that not enough black people live in these cities?  Why don&rsquo;t they get off their snivelly behinds, stop having kids at 14, quit the drugs and alcohol, GET A DECENT EDUCATION, get a career, and become contributing citizens who could AFFORD to buy homes in these areas????  They want something for nothing, as always, so they&rsquo;re hoping the guv&rsquo;m&rsquo;t will give them free housing in these cities.  </p>

		<p>9 percent black is too much.  The only manageable black percentage is 5 percent or lower.  Look at San Francisco crime statistics.  The less than 8 percent blacks commit most of the crime.</p>

		<p>Black demands seem to have gone completely off the rails since Obama&rsquo;s election.  What do these people want  &mdash;  only cities in GA with majority black populations, so that black mayors, etc. will be elected?  Apparently, some black leaders believe they can brazenly demand advantages for blacks that even the most extreme civil rights or Affirmative Action interpretations would not!  Whites cannot be prohibited from living where they want and can afford any more than any other ethnicity, though Eric Holder and his ilk might give that impression.  <br>
Outrageous black behavior is already suffering a backlash, and things are slated to only get worse for this group.  They would do well to shut up.</p>

		<p>My job in Atlanta requires me to drive many miles. I have logged more than 500,000 of them over the past 15 years. I have been to every &#8220;cubby hole&#8221; there is in this city. At the risk of sounding &#8220;smug&#8221; I know Atlanta like the back of my hand! I have been north to Brasselton, south to Stockbridge, east to Conyers, and west to Carrollton - and to a few towns beyond those mentioned! Every where I go it is the same story - where there are Africans - there is Africa! When I go to Sandy Springs and Johns Creek there is relief! The roads are better, the people are friendlier, and the service is better in places of business. <br>
I&rsquo;m almost 60 and I will soon retire. I will retire far away from Atlanta because of the idiocy that is contained in this article. Do you think the people of Johns Creek and Sandy Springs are safe? As I saw in the horror movie Jacobs Ladder - &#8220;DREAM ON!&#8221;</p>

		<p>The best thing to do, if they can, is for the white citizens to move out of the area altogether, so it will wind up looking like Detroit.</p>
<p>Under black residency and rule, it will be no time before dope dealers takeover, the majority of government employees will be on the take and violence and murders will be as common as parking tickets.</p>
<p>There will be so much graft and theft going on by so many black demagogues the governmental structure will become dysfunctional.   </p>

Blacks are consumed by jealousy and hatred for what they can&rsquo;t do for themselves.</p>
<p>Should they succeed, let&rsquo;s hope that when blacks decide they want a &ldquo;super-majority black&rdquo; community, their own precedent will be used against them.</p>

		<p>I have the solution to every &#8220;all white community&#8221; being told they need to be more diverse- instead of giving criminal Blacks vouchers to move there, import SMART, hard working immigrants from China and India- the crime rate will go DOWN and school test score will go WAY UP.</p>
<p>We Indian immigrants are not the problem but the SOLUTION to the diversity dilemma. Even you white nationalists who criticize us have to admit that we are far, far, far more desirable than you-know-who.</p>

		<p>It seems the only part of the U.S. Constitution with any Federal standing IS the 14th Amendment. It overthrew the entire Constitution and not one Senator from a Southern State helped write it. We are following, by force,  an Attainder of Treason. The only problem is, we did not commit Treason. Ever. The Constitution explicitly requires that no Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood or Forfiture except during the lifetime of the person so attained. The Confederate politicians and soldiers are ALL dead. This amendment does not apply to any American now living. The 14th Amendment is obsolete. It has legally expired. The original Constitution of the United States is legally binding again!!! Lets get our money back for the Slaves. </p>

		<p>&#8220;The newly incorporated (districts) constitute a poorly veiled attempt to gerrymander voting districts,&#8221; the lawsuit states. &#8220;The creation of the (districts) within Fulton and DeKalb county effectively carved out super majority political units from majority minority political units.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
In other words, if White people come together in political and geographical unity, we afrovoodoo blacks will use the power of government to break them up, and the time is right for this latest victory over Whitey, because the blacks only Obama-Holder DOJ is on our side and will fight with us against White Humanity&rsquo;s never-ending struggle to form safe, peaceful, and prosperous White Communities, which we all know is just a racist construct based on the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and institutional bias against black advancement and for perpetuation of unearned White privilege.</p>
<p><br>

<p>Civil Rights leader and icon Joseph Lowery, another fake &#8220;Reverend&#8221; race-hustling scam artist, just like &#8220;Messiah&#8221; Rev. MLK: &#8220;&hellip;that the Voting Rights Act is recognized and honored and that we are not seeing a whole lot of all White cities&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lowery was the black whom Obama chose to give the prayer at the &#8220;historic inaguration of our great first African American president.&#8221;  Remember? &#8220;When black will not be asked to get back, when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead, man, and when white will embrace what is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whites forming their own cities is Wrong! in the time of Obama.</p>
<p>He talks about the VR Act the same way all the blacks talk when demanding another Humanitarian Award for Civil Rights leader and icon on Rep. John Lewis, who must constantly be &#8220;recognized and honored&#8221; for his &#8220;courageous march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.&#8221; </p>
<p>If you ever want to send a message to the afrovoodoos that you are committed to the Diversity Treatment&rsquo;s anti-racist agenda, you must hold a memorial service for Rosa Parks, MLK, the Civil Rights martyrs, and get John Lewis to be there to receive a shiny medal and a huge honorarium check. The </p>
<p>Lowery&rsquo;s monkeyshine proves that blacks most hate unified White Humanity. Whites must not be allowed to come together in common cause, because when they do, they are forming unhealthy White identities that permit virulent and toxic racism to run rampant and violate the mandate of global dignity. All White cities aren&rsquo;t &#8220;fully living into the American Creed of Equality and promoting diversity through helping minorities tell their stories with authentic voices that hold Whites accountable for America&rsquo;s original sin. White communities do not surround their White daughters with multicultural understanding and sensitivity, and that prevents our black boys to having easy access to what they want and deserve.  When our black boys can&rsquo;t have their pick of White girls to date, it sends a painful message of inferiority and damages their self-esteem through institutionalized hatred and fear caused by the shameful and exclusionary White communities. We&rsquo;ve come far, but we have much more work to do.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Atlanta: Vibrant, Safe, and Diverse&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a raciss would ask anyone to prove the &#8220;Safe&#8221; part.</p>
<p>Atlanta TV news swarms with black reporters, which pretty much means that black crime is under-reported.  The Whites reporters are outnumbered 3 to 1. </p>
<p>Every black giving you TV news has the job that White had earned, but was denied because they lacked &#8220;enriching, affirming, and much needed diversity.  We don&rsquo;t care. Whites in the media are liberal, and we encourage the Diversity Curse to fully disposses them of all their hopes and dreams.</p>
<p>If you watch TV in Atlanta, you are getting your news and weather from mostly the blacks, and women are high-yella mulattos, and the men are full blooded black Africans. In Atlanta, your mayor is black, your fire chief is black, your police chief is black, your schools superintendant is mulatto. What could go wrong?<br>

		<p>THis one&rsquo;s pretty funny.  First of all, the state of Georgia is BROKE.   Frivolous lawsuits are getting to be mighty unpopular these days in the Peach State.  The &#8220;black caucus&#8221; is still trying to live off the White man.  They still think we all sit around counting the coins in our money bags all day.  Funny thing happened recently.  All the money in the U.S. started to disappear.  These welfare bums just don&rsquo;t get it.  They are ignorant of the laws of economics.  This is getting little attention even here in the Atlanta area as people have a lot more to worry about these days.  Also,  this an effort to divert attention away from their own incompetence.  They are parasites desperate to find a White man to feed off of,  but not likely to happen these days.  A little silver lining around the dark economic cloud.  </p>

		<p>What this actually translates to is that these blacks need white slaves to pay their taxes and take care of them. This is an admission of incompetence on the part of blacks and a great deal of envy as well. They just can&rsquo;t let whites have their own game even though they insist on blacks having their exclusive games. Tell me black leaders, what is it about you that so much needs to be taken care of by whites? Do you have no faith in yourselves? Do you believe that any time whites move out that you will end up with another Detroit? I do. Your actions have shown this to be the case, and your lawsuits are an admission of that fact. What a shame that blacks have so little competence and so little confidence!</p>

		<p>These are the Whites committed the shameful, hateful, extremist, fear-mongering act of White flight when they abandoned the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>Look at the current academic screeds against White flight.  All the problems of formerly White neighborhoods are blamed on the Whites who &#8220;abandoned the community by listening to the voices of intolerance and exclusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>Whites are now told that they must recognized their role in destroying their former neighborhoods by leaving when the blacks started moving in.</p>
<p>This lawsuit is a part of the ongoing and always successful plan to punish Whites for black dysfunction. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you know that all the black caucus members are well steeped in the &#8220;harmful effects of White flight and White privilege&#8221;.  That&rsquo;s what they hear in &#8220;church&#8221; every Sunday from their black &#8220;pastor&#8221;. And it&rsquo;s all they talk about. Have you ever seen two blacks talking together and wondered what they were saying? They were talking about you and your racist White privilege and how they must cure you with the Curse of Diversity Treatment.</p>
<p>Whites just don&rsquo;t comprehend how constantly blacks are talking and plotting to make us miserable.  We think eruptions like this lawsuit are spontaneous after the blacks have been made to endure too much discrimination, but there is nothing spontaneous about it at all. Just like Rosa Parks, they are constantly in training for the next assault on White Humanity, White Community, and White Dignity.</p>
<p>Beware and prepare, because you really do know what&rsquo;s coming next&hellip;</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, here in Seattle, the left is trying to cut up the city into two congressional districts for the explicit purpose of making it easier for minorities to gain political power:</p>
<p>&#8220;As work begins on reshaping Washington&rsquo;s congressional-district boundaries, some local activists want to see the state create a district that  &mdash;  for the first time  &mdash;  would be more than half minority.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>The Win/Win Network, a nonprofit group, drew up the potential &#8220;majority people of color&#8221; district and plans to submit it to the Washington State Redistricting Commission, the bipartisan panel charged with redrawing the state&rsquo;s political map this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intent is really to increase representation for communities of color,&#8221; said George Cheung, director of the liberal-leaning organization.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Just because Atlanta&rsquo;s debutantes look 100% Whites Only, don&rsquo;t expect them to be in Order. They live in the White enclaves, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean much to our cause, other than the hopeful and uplifting image of Whites getting way from Atlanta&rsquo;s swarms of blacks.  These Whites are Not race realists.</p>

These are the kind of college educated Whiteys who have learned how to think, speak, and write correctly about our need to foster diversity and help minorities.  They live as far away from diversity as possible (shameful vestige of Jim Crow segregation), but if they are ever your boss, they will do whatever their diversity and inclusion officer tells them to and then promote a black to the job you&rsquo;ve earned.</p>
<p>They are all out for themselves, have no sense of racial community, and as long as they can be mostly around people like themselves at the country club in a mutual admiration ego fulfillment society, they&rsquo;ll ruin your chances ever to earn enough money to join the same club.</p>
<p>They think the diversity will always treat them with compassion and kindness, even when the diversity is the majority.</p>
<p>These are the Whiteys we&rsquo;ll throw over the barricades so they can get the full diversity treatment from their diversity pets.<br>

Lowery said the goal is to uphold the federal law. </p>
<p>&ldquo;I support the caucus that is making sure the Voting Rights Act is recognized and honored,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and making sure we are not seeing all-white cities that do not reflect the kind of environment the Voting Rights Act seeks.&rdquo; </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Reconstruction II in a nutshell.</p>
<p>There it is folks- the federal government&rsquo;s Voting Rights Act is specifically implemented to prevent our White Humanity from pursuing God-ordained life, liberty, and happiness.</p>
<p>If the blacks don&rsquo;t want you to enjoy being in America, they will use the power of government to make sure you are miserable while you are here.</p>
<p>The lawsuit will fail, but that will help the blacks have another Civil Rights crisis that must be addresses through more teaching tolerance and sensitivity programs in White owned businesses in these White enclaves.  This is a shakedown scam for the diversity industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever Whites gather in large numbers without monitoring by the NAACP, SPLC, ADL Axis of Enforced Tolerance, virulent and toxic racism breaks out and does terrible damage to the feelings of America&rsquo;s most valuable and contributing citizens.</p>
<p>A failed lawsuit will give them more power when they say &#8220;we have much more work to do&#8221;.</p>
<p>When will White children start seeing the truth and demanding that their fathers become men and say No to diversity?<br>

		<p>This lawsuit is frivolous on its face. Georgia law and federal law require Dept. of Justice (HA!) preclearance when property is annexed (or &#8220;municipalized&#8221;) into a city. These cities have already received DOJ clearance. Case closed. </p>

Rep. Lynne Riley, R-Johns Creek, called the lawsuit &ldquo;frivolous&rdquo; and &ldquo;disrespectful to the citizens of these cities who are most satisfied with their government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why are we losing?  Because White politicians don&rsquo;t know how to fight the good fight using the most successful tactics ever deployed in the race contest of Reconstruction II.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t take every opportunity to shame your enemy and demean their morality in the eyes of the public, you are ceding ground to them and don&rsquo;t deserve to keep what is yours.</p>
<p>What rejoicing would have risen up in the awakened hearts of White Atlantans if he had said this instead of the mamby pamby sissy talk that he did?</p>
<p>Rep. Lynne Riley, R-Johns Creek, called the lawsuit &ldquo;frivolous&rdquo; and &ldquo;disrespectful to the citizens of these cities who are most satisfied with their government. I call on Joseph Lowery and the entire Black Caucus to recognize their interference in the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness of my White constituents, and they must acknowledge our pain with a heartfelt and substantive apology. Shame on Joseph Lowery.&rdquo;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the time interval that is the obvious thing-</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
Sandy Springs, created in 2005, is 65 percent white and 20 percent black. Milton, formed a year later, is 76.6 percent white and 9 percent black. Johns Creek, also formed that year, is 63.5 percent white and 9.2 percent black. Chattahoochee Hills, formed in 2007, is 68.6 percent white and 28 percent black, while Dunwoody, created in 2008, is 69.8 percent white and 12.6 percent black.<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>2005: 65 percent white and 20 percent black. <br>
2006: 76.6 percent white and 9 percent black. <br>
2006: 63.5 percent white and 9.2 percent black.<br>
2007: 68.6 percent white and 28 percent black, while Dunwoody, 2008: 69.8 percent white and 12.6 percent black.</p>
<p>While I would be curious to see driving distances from a major urban center like Atlanta and resulting property values for some of these cities, what is clear is that with an overall State population density of 61% blacks, it took less than 5 years to see supposed WSM municipalities become mixed with anywhere from 10-30% black populations when only crossing a 4-5% threshold leads to noticeable rises in criminality and resultant property value dropoffs.</p>
<p>This with the tenth highest teen pregnancy rate and 40% or more failing to graduate high school before &#8216;getting started&rsquo;-</p>

<p>Means that a white person will never get ahead, nor stay there, because other races will out breed you and _create the demand_ for &#8216;added living space&rsquo;.  Where you have considerately saved space and wealth for them.  Right next door to you.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t anything here to save people, there hasn&rsquo;t been in decades.  The South is DEAD.  Move along.  Don&rsquo;t stop driving until you hit a Farm State.</p>

		<p>Some thoughts:</p>
<p>If &#8220;race is just a construct,&#8221; then what difference ought it make what the &#8220;color of skin&#8221; is for a city&rsquo;s residents/voters?</p>
<p>If there are &ldquo;harmful effects of White flight and White privilege&rdquo; then why would blacks want to live in cities containing White people, who presumably would be constantly plotting to discriminate against and otherwise oppress blacks?</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t White liberals move into Atlanta in order to enrich themselves in the city&rsquo;s diversity?</p>
<p>Why on earth can&rsquo;t the black leadership or DoJ tackle real problems in the black community such as crime, illegitimacy, failing education, and so forth? </p>

		<p>&#8220;We Indian immigrants are not the problem but the SOLUTION to the diversity dilemma. Even you white nationalists who criticize us have to admit that we are far, far, far more desirable than you-know-who.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lesser of two evils, is still evil.</p>
<p>What amazes me is that the record of ALL non-white interactions with Europeans historically have demonstrated the UTTER INCOMPATIBILITY of these peoples, with the White Race!</p>
<p>While this poster may have a point (whether or not it is a good one, is another matter) how can Hindoo polytheism, suttee, caste systems, and stealing jobs from educated White Americans (If I have to listen to someone who sounds like Apu from the Simpsons when calling &#8216;customer service&rsquo; one more time&hellip;&hellip;) be IN ANY WAY, &#8216;better&rsquo; for Americans?</p>
<p>&#8220;For US, and for OUR posterity: - the White Founding Fathers of this country made it clear. America for Americans!</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have the solution to every &ldquo;all white community&rdquo; being told they need to be more diverse- instead of giving criminal Blacks vouchers to move there, import SMART, hard working immigrants from China and India- the crime rate will go DOWN and school test score will go WAY UP.&#8221;</p>
<p>I like where you&rsquo;re coming from. Consider this, however: why do &#8220;all white&#8221; communities need a solution? What&rsquo;s the problem? &#8220;All white&#8221; communities are some of the most diverse   &mdash;   in terms of ethnic background and religion   &mdash;   on earth, and as a result are some of the least cohesive. </p>
<p>So cohesive, in fact, that they make only the feeblest attempts to protect themselves from crime, colonization, the sexual exploitation of their children, and exploitative guilt-tripping of all kinds? </p>
<p>Why should this weakness be compounded further, especially when other communities are so much more homogeneous? </p>

<p>Can you deny that if an outsider were to wander into an Indian community, in India, and attack women and children that the community&rsquo;s response would be a great deal more robust than any &#8220;all white&#8221; community in the United States could muster? </p>

		<p>I bet there are ethnic residents who are mortified by this lawsuit. And I bet they vote the same way their white neighbors do   &mdash;   for lowest taxes possible, good school board, etc. But a small vocal angry group wants to barrel in and boss other people around. The solution is for the ethnic residents to speak up   &mdash;   but that takes time, and they likely work long hours like their white neighbors. </p>
<p>People move to nice areas to get away from bad school systems and crime. I don&rsquo;t know anyone personally, never have, who moved because of race. In this country, it&rsquo;s always a balance between   &mdash;   not race   &mdash;   but how much you can buy on your income (the best education for your kids and the most reasonable house possible) and how far you are willing to drive to do it. Living on the poor side of a nice-to-do town is better than living in the &#8220;gentrified area&#8221; of a crime-ridden town. That&rsquo;s how my Mom raised us, in a good school system and we lived in the poorer side of a nice town, and we all worked hard and went to college and have been gainfully employed and have earned our way to promotions and such. And that was because my Mom took the leap and we moved to a nice town like Chapel Hill, NC, and away from crud like Durham, NC. </p>
