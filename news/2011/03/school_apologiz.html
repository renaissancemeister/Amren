<h1>School Apologizes for Elementary &#8216;Slave Auction&rsquo;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>WBNS-TV (Columbus), March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A central Ohio school district was apologizing on Thursday after an elementary school Social Studies lesson turned into a mock slave auction.</p>
<p>Nikko Burton said during an American history lesson at Gahanna&rsquo;s Chapelfield Elementary School, the class was divided into slaves and masters, 10 Investigates&rsquo; Paul Aker reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ended up being a slave,&#8221; said Burton, 10. &#8220;At first I didn&rsquo;t care, but after people were bidding on people it kind of made me a little mad and stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burton said that the students who were playing the part of master were told to feel the students playing slaves to see if they were worth buying.</p>
<p>&#8220;The masters go to touch people and do all sorts of stuff,&#8221; Burton said. &#8220;They got to look in your mouth and feel your legs and stuff and see if you&rsquo;re strong and stuff.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burton&rsquo;s mother said that her son was humiliated.</p>
<p>She complained to Gahanna-Jefferson schools. School officials declined to comment but did issue a statement that said, in part, &#8220;As soon as the concern was brought to our attention, school officials acted promptly to speak with the parent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He felt degraded, he was hurt and the kids picked on him later,&#8221; Aneka Burton said. &#8220;I feel like that was totally inappropriate; it was racist and it was degrading.&#8221;</p>
<p>A district spokeswoman said the slave auction was part of state required curriculum and that it was a one-time lesson.</p>

		<p>No child, black or white, should be asked to take any role in a manipulative, loathsome play like this.  It is a tactic of leftist educators, to assume that teaching the children the historical facts is not enough.  The educational goal is instead to evoke an emotional response and identification with the politically favored group.  </p>
<p>I was put through a couple of these as a child once as a victim and once as bad guy and I remember how used and betrayed I felt.  So I&rsquo;m with the Burtons here although IMO the role assignment wasn&rsquo;t necessarily racist, just education business as usual.</p>

		<p>The hilarious thing about this is that the school was trying to be all politically correct with this and it backfired! What do you want to bet that this &#8220;lesson&#8221; gave students the impression that slavery was something that only America engaged in and it was only ended when blacks demanded their freedom? Maybe the kids will come to believe that the buying and selling of slaves ended in 1963 thanks to Martin Luther King and the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; movement? Maybe in the future, they should make only black students the slave masters and only whites the slaves, and then Americans will forget that slavery was supposedly a &#8220;white thing&#8221; and they can get off the guilt trip over something that they themselves ended over 150 years ago.</p>

		<p>On a related note&hellip;. I just saw a `60`s movie with an image I don`t see anymore. It was a guy in a wheelchair WITH a leg cast. The notion being he had been in  a ski accident. And I got to wondering if there is a &#8220;law&#8221; about showing anyone in a wheel chair onscreen nowadays with a  visual clue to let the audience know it wasn`t permanent. <br>
  Every guy I`ve seen from Ironsides in the early `70`s, on to the guy in Vegas has been portrayed as dealing with a permanent condition. Maybe being able to get up out of it violates some kind of feelings clause or is too close to a Jesus parable? I`m just saying&hellip;</p>

It&rsquo;s odd that blacks like nothing better than to incessantly remind us that they were slaves but they don&rsquo;t like to be reminded they were slaves.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;A district spokeswoman said the slave auction was part of state required curriculum and that it was a one-time lesson.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet this &#8216;one-time lesson&rsquo; was demanded by radical black activists to teach black students black history.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no mention that the teacher who orchestrated this event was black or white. Had the teacher been white, it would have been included in the report.</p>
<p>I wonder if this school will now consider running Janet Elliot&rsquo;s &#8220;Blue Eyes&#8221; experiment. Humiliating white kids generally doesn&rsquo;t incite outrage.</p>

Seriously? Anyone with half a brain has to know this is a STUPID idea. Apparently, in their rush to push more white guilt, they didn&rsquo;t think things through very well.</p>

		<p>Oh, heck. Some of my high school students think slavery was still happening in the US during the Great Depression. One thinks that New York&rsquo;s Harlem was originally settled by blacks, hence the name&hellip; *sigh*<br>
I&rsquo;d probably get into trouble if I had them read the Gregory Kane article about buying and selling slaves in the Sudan.</p>
