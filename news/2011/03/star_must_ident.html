<h1>Star Must Identify Anonymous Posters to Website, Judge Rules</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeff Swiatek, Indianapolis Star, March 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Marion County judge has ruled, for the first time in Indiana, that news media outlets can be ordered by the court to reveal identifying information about posters to their online forums.</p>
<p>In rulings this week and last week, Marion Superior Court Judge S.K. Reid became the first judge in Indiana to rule on whether the state journalism shield law protects media outlets from being forced to disclose names of anonymous posters on their websites or other identifying information about those posters, said Kevin Betz, an attorney for Jeffrey Miller, former chief executive of Junior Achievement of Central Indiana.</p>
<p>The rulings came in a defamation lawsuit Miller filed last year. He is seeking to broaden the list of defendants in his case to include people who criticized him anonymously last year on websites run by The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis Business Journal and WRTV (Channel 6).</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>All three Indianapolis media outlets fought the subpoenas served on them to turn over identifying information about posters to their sites.</p>
<p>The judge ruled that The Star and IBJ must turn over the identifying information, which typically tells a poster&rsquo;s Internet protocol address or Internet provider. Using that, an attorney can subpoena the Internet provider for the poster&rsquo;s real name.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Betz said he doesn&rsquo;t see the judge&rsquo;s recent rulings as weakening the state&rsquo;s shield law, which gives broad protections to news reporters from having to disclose names of sources who provide information used in news stories.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an assault on the shield law,&#8221; Betz said. {snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;All it is is cyberbullying. And these kind of individuals need to understand there is accountability for that kind of behavior.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This is one way that the govenment is controlling the message a blog response is like a vote it needs to be secret. People are far more likely to give thier own real opinions regarding issues and people if they are anonymous. This is more judicial review designed to shut white people and true conservatives up. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it most of us are terrified of the witch hunt mentality of the far left and know they would do anything to ruin someone who they strongly disagree with. </p>

		<p>No doubt a leftist judge. Yes, an attorney can subpoena the ISP to get your real name. Then what? Eric Holder&rsquo;s minions are going to come to your house? Nothing amazes me anymore.</p>
<p>Just make sure you have a Dynamic IP (instead of a Static IP) and keep changing it.</p>

		<p>If I were an attorney I would have a lot of fun with this one  &#8220;So, Mr. Miller, you are suing because you got pown3d by an anonymous, an anonymous comment on a message board on the internet? Just how much damage could being pown3d by anonymous do, when its post 617 out of 985? Oh no, the world will end, some anonymous guy said something about me, and another anonymous person commented&hellip; Bring me my attorney!&#8221; </p>
<p>By the time I was done with him he would have the same reputation as the star wars kid.</p>

<p>Right. This is all about intimidation. The persons that sue want your name to include you in the law suit as you have &#8220;defamed&#8221; them.</p>
<p>These are persons such as Miller, who are in the public domain. Defamation is much more difficult for Miller to prove but he can go after folks to intimidate them by threatening to have their names made public.</p>

		<p>VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT.</p>
<p>First of all, to force the site to reveal names is wrong.  Secondly, it violates the first amendment.</p>
<p>If there are not able to block this on appeal, they should file a bar complaint against Miller&rsquo;s attorney.  Because the comments of Posters, even if negative, and even if defamatory, or not actionable (due to a very long list of reasons) and any suit against them would be a violation of Rule 11 by Miller&rsquo;s attorney, exposing him to sanctions and disciplinary action for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>

<p>Strange all the barking dogs we&rsquo;re not hearing bark from those back yards, isn&rsquo;t it?  That must mean only a few things:  (1) This suspect&rsquo;s internet activity is too embarrassing to certain people in certain high places, NOT to Jared Taylor, (2) That the extent to the suspect&rsquo;s &#8220;links&#8221; to AR was that Google/YouTube&rsquo;s algorithms, for some strange reason, &#8220;suggested&#8221; an AR-themed video (not an official one, AR has no official YT channel) on the page of one of the lunatic&rsquo;s pothead schizophrenic rants.</p>
<p>Example:  I use Twitter a lot.  Twitter always generates a short list of people whom it thinks you might want to follow, and puts it on your Twitter front page.  This morning, Twitter suggested I follow one Visanthe Shiancoe, a Minnesota Vikings tight end, black-Nigerian, by way of Birmingham, England.  Now, why Twitter thought I would want to follow him was beyond me, until I realized that the only plausible hook was that on several occasions, I have voiced my particular (lack of) clothing choice for sleeping, and Mr. Shiancoe was involved in an &#8220;oops&#8221; incident a few years ago when he very briefly appeared on national TV in &#8220;the full monty&#8221; while TV cameras were trolling the Vikings clubhouse live after a game.</p>
<p>Needless to say, computers and their algorithms have some way to go.</p>

<p>My foot.  Of course &#8220;they say&#8221; they have a file on all of us, and of course &#8220;they say&#8221; they know more about you than even you know about you.  &#8220;They&#8221; have an incentive to make you think that, as an intimidation tactic.  In reality, even in the Hoover days, there was just way too much paper information to process, even for the relatively few people the FBI wanted to track.  Now, in the digital age, it&rsquo;s even more overwhelming, exponentially.</p>
<p>Cops and prosecutors love to promulgate the notion that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a perfect crime, that they always catch their man.  They do that to preclude you and me from committing crime.  In reality, cops and prosecutors often don&rsquo;t catch their man.</p>

		<p>When I saw this&hellip;.on TV I thought about my posts on boards like this.  I honestly don&rsquo;t think I say anything that isn&rsquo;t true.  </p>
<p>I came to the conclusion YEARS AGO that I am a racist by all liberal standards.  I believe that Philip Rushton and Charles Murray are completely correct.  I taught in an all black school and grew up in Detroit.  The last thing they want to do is corner a guy like me and try to make me out to be one of the &#8220;nation of cowards&#8221; as Eric Holder put it.  I would come out swinging with facts, figures and dozens of personal stories of friends, family and neighbors who have been brutalized by blacks in Detroit.   </p>
<p>Again, the last thing they want is to put a camera on a guy like me.  And if they do it to others, I will show my support as I have in the past.  </p>
<p>If you go on YouTube, you can find dozens and dozens of black on white crime video.  What is on YouTube is the opposite of what you see in the mainstream media.   <br>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>1) They know more about you because they know more about themselves and project their behavior onto others. Another reason they know more is because they make it up. How can you know about yourself when someone else makes it up.</p>
<p><br>
2) More than often. There are many unsolved murders in Oakland California even though there are cameras everywhere. The only way the Police can solve a problem is if someone else solves it first. </p>

		<p>Word to the wise:  if you use a wireless connection for your computer, like you can get from AT&T; or Sprint and they cost about $69/mo and you plug it into your USB port, your IP address automatically changes every time you use your computer.  This is one way to keep from being traced.  It isn&rsquo;t cheap, but, those of us who used to post kazillions of ads on Craig&rsquo;s List used to use those things for that reason.  Our software changed the IP for every post automatically.  Then Craigs List put in the crazy capchas and that killed that.  But - for the future, everybody consider laptops and wireless connections&hellip;..</p>

		<p>Of course the government has the ability to covertly spy on every Americans phone, email, and internet activity and they do it on a mass scale.  What they want now is to be able to legally and publicly use the information they collect against individuals.  Cases like this are the first step.</p>

		<p>The First Amendment protection of free speech does not include the right to defame public figures.  The Website was ordered to reveal only the identities of those potentially liable for defamation, not everyone who had a negative opinion.  Nothing in this court order is novel or surprising.</p>
<p>This is why I don&rsquo;t commit defamation as an anonymous poster&hellip;</p>
