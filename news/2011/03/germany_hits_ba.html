<h1><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/28/turkish-pm-addresses-immigrants-germany">Germany Hits Back after Turkish PM Tells Immigrants to Resist Assimilation</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helen Pidd, Guardian (London), Feb. 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Germany has hit back at explosive remarks by Turkey&rsquo;s prime minister, who told his compatriots that they should learn Turkish before German and resist assimilation into German society.</p>
<p>During a visit to Germany, Recep Tayyip Erdogan told 10,000 members of Germany&rsquo;s large Turkish community of his &#8220;growing unease&#8221; about the way immigrants are treated in Germany.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must integrate, but I am against assimilation &hellip; no one may ignore the rights of minorities,&#8221; he said, adding that individuals should have the right to practise their own faith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our children must learn German but they must learn Turkish first,&#8221; said Erdogan.<br>
He added: &#8220;I want you to learn German, that your children learn German  &mdash;  they should study, get degrees. I want you to become doctors, professors and politicians in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, promptly hit back, saying that the children of the 3.5-million-strong Turkish community should focus on German to improve their chances in life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children growing up in Germany must learn German first,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The German language is the key to integration for those growing up in Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>The row threatened to overshadow Erdogan&rsquo;s Germany trip. He is due to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who caused controversy in October when she said that multiculturalism in Germany had &#8220;utterly failed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Though his speech reflected Turkey&rsquo;s unease about what many Turks perceive to be Europe&rsquo;s increasing xenophobia, it was also an attempt to drum up votes.</p>
<p>There is a general election in Turkey in June and for the first time Turks abroad will be able to vote at Turkish consulates.</p>
<p>Germany, with almost two million eligible voters, will be the fourth largest constituency after Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir.</p>
<p>Erdogan is offering as part of his manifesto a better deal for Turks abroad  &mdash;  specifically, a new &#8220;blue card&#8221;, which is a kind of dual nationality identity card that would allow Turks with German passports more rights back in Turkey.</p>
<p>It is currently impossible to hold both German and Turkish passports, and Turks who opt for a German one often find life difficult if they return to the country of their birth.</p>
<p>Erdogan&rsquo;s rhetoric seemed to go down well in DÃ¼sseldorf. &#8220;The Germans will never accept us but Erdogan does,&#8221; one man told Der Spiegel.</p>
<p>Another said: &#8220;Finally someone feels responsible for us. For the first time a Turkish prime minister is not forgetting his countrymen abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Saturday, Erdogan made an even sharper criticism of German immigration policy, telling the Rheinische Post newspaper that forced integration requiring immigrants to suppress their culture and language violated international law.</p>
<p>Immigration leapt to the forefront of political debate in 2010 after the central banker Thilo Sarrazin published a bestselling book that argued German culture was at risk from Muslims, who he said were a drain on state coffers.</p>
<p>The debate left raw nerves on both sides. German politicians initially closed ranks to condemn Sarrazin&rsquo;s theories, but later many shifted rightwards in tone as polls showed he enjoyed widespread support. Sarrazin later stepped down.</p>
<p>Erdogan&rsquo;s newspaper comments were published alongside those of a senior German politician who complained of discrimination against Christians in Turkey.</p>
<p>The Conservative parliamentary floor leader, Volker Kauder, told the same paper that land belonging to a Christian monastery in Turkey known as Mor Gabriel was being expropriated, which he said showed that the Muslim country lacked religious freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I urge the EU to not open any more negotiation chapters with Turkey as long as Turkey does not guarantee full freedom of religion,&#8221; Kauder said.</p>
<p>Erdogan&rsquo;s speech came before a meeting with Merkel scheduled for today, where Turkey&rsquo;s bid to join the European Union is likely to be discussed.</p>
<p>The two leaders have a fractious relationship. Last year Merkel made a tense visit to Turkey after Erdogan accused her of harbouring hatred towards Turks.<br>

Germany is home to around 2.7 million people of Turkish heritage who first came in the 1960s to help rebuild the country after the second world war.</p>

<p>I believe this is an erroneous statement.  The United States  supplied most of the funds to rebuild Germany and it was the German people that supplied most, if not all, of the labor.  Germany was already rebuilt by the 1960&rsquo;s.  Turks went to Germany for work but found welfare.<br>

<p>It is a common misconception that Turks helped rebuild Germany. By the time Turks showed up Germany was rebuilt. Italiens and Greeks came first, they were referred to as &#8220;guest workers&#8221;. They started out as sanitation workers, janitors, etc. I ought to know, I was there. </p>

		<p>Strange to say, but I agree with Turkey and disagree with Germany here.  Don&rsquo;t integrate.  Stay Turkish.  Show them good for nothing Germans who won&rsquo;t honor diversity a thing or three   &mdash;   In fact, do them one better   &mdash;   Go back to Turkey and be great in Turkey, with all your other great Turks.</p>
<p>I should say that &#8220;hoping&#8221; that Turks in Germany don&rsquo;t integrate into German society is about as insightful as hoping for water to be wet.  </p>

		<p>Erdogan is absolutely right on this.</p>
<p>Turks living abroad in Germany should have the rights to maintain their Turkish citizenship, creed, language and separate school system.  They should be encouraged to self-segregate as much as possible.</p>
<p>Germany, for its part, should put all foreigners on a limited visa system, restricting and limiting their rights to that of &#8216;temporary resident foreign nationals&rsquo;. </p>

		<p>They should not assimilate or integrate. They are proud to be Turks. However, they also have their own country which is called Turkey to which they should transfer. If they want to be Turks they should do so in Turkey rather than burdening other nationalities with their unwanted racial factionalism. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that 1) The Turks in Germany are Turkish Nationalists and 2) That Erdogan continues to encourage the German-Turks to remain Turkish.  But the worst part of this story is that the strongest response the Germans are making is that the Turks need to learn German, as even if they do, they will still be Turkish Nationalists and remain as a Muslim fifth column within Europe. The Germans need to take the lead in removing all non-Europeans from Europe, and they should start by repatriating the Turks to Turkey.  Granted, I would say that we are doing even worse in regard to Mexicans in America, but we can still run (White flight) and eventually break up the U.S. along ethnocentric lines. The Germans and the other Europeans are packed in already, and they are running out of space.</p>

<p>Read:  I want you to stay Turks, but be successful, so that you may take over Germany and make it an Islamic state sometime in the future. </p>
<p>The fact that he specifically states that he wishes Turks in Germany to become politicians is frightening.  How can you unabashedly tell them NOT to become German, and in the very same speech tell them that you want them to become German politicians.  You shouldn&rsquo;t be a GERMAN politician if you&rsquo;re not even German!</p>

<p>Erdogan displays the very same arrogance and sense of entitlement re other people&rsquo;s countries, that Mexican leaders from Fox to Calderon display re the US. A sense that they have the right to dictate terms to another, infinitely more successful nation, simply because their own nation has exported a lot of their unskilled and uneducated peasants there. </p>
<p>At this rate, it is only a matter of time before some Turco-German activists start spreading some crack-brained irredentist theory that Germany historically &#8220;belongs&#8221; to Turkey; and that Turkey has the &#8220;right&#8221; to &#8220;reclaim&#8221; that territory. </p>
<p>Anybody know the Turkish word for &#8220;Reconquista&#8221;?</p>

		<p>The problem with all of this is that if they DO assimilate, this will create more miscegenation and a lowering of the German racial stock. So integrating with Muslim Turks is not the answer for Germany. Germany would be best off at this point to completely restrict immigration and let the Turks continue to speak Turkish. Then more of them might get the idea to leave Germany and go back to their Muslim homelands.<br>
     For Turkey joining the EU, this is much more than a matter of religious rights. Their history, racial background and culture are all poisonous to the European people. The idea of Turkey joining should be taken off the table - permanently. </p>

		<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that the Turks &#8220;came&#8221; to Germany after WWII, it&rsquo;s that the American military forced those Turks onto Germany (at least the western parts) after WWII as an attempt to &#8220;denasify&#8221; the territory.</p>

Germany carries far less stigma than it did when the main stream media saturated the country with propaganda.<br>
If America does not stand up in defiance of third world immigration at home, Germany will soon be saturated to extinction and America will be in a position where we will have turned our backs on our own principles by nullifying Germanys right to exist.</p>

		<p>The Turkish invasion in what is left of Germany is uncontrolled and is similar in many ways to what has come about in California with the Mexican invasion. The Germans are often a minority in their own cities. Turks themselves loath integration and of all the different immigrant groups now flooding in to Germany the ones least likely to succeed at integration. Why? Partly it is their numbers, more than five (5) million Turks have come and it would appear are planning on a longer stay. Beyond their numbers it is that they do not even try to assimilate, any one that has worked or had to do with Turks in Germany has come to know their propensity toward only speaking their language at all times even at the work place, and their endeavour to remain Turks first and foremost in the Diaspora with all the Turkish features of life in place is much of the problem. This along with the assistance of their (the Turkish) government working openly in the background promoting this activity to the maximum is making the many millions of Turks more like invaders rather than &ldquo;migrants&rdquo; as the German government would have the Germans naively believe.</p>

<p>In light of 800 years of atrocities committed by Turks throughout the Balkans and Middle east, Erdogen has no business lecturing others on the &#8220;rights of minorities&#8221;. More recently, Armenians and Kurds come to mind. Erdogen&rsquo;s latest remarks only show that a leopard doesn&rsquo;t change it&rsquo;s spots. If Turkey is trying to establish a hostile colony then Germany has no obligation to allow them to remain. Most Turks living in Germany have a &#8220;blue card&#8221; and the right to vote in Turkish elections. That is de facto dual citizenship. So Germany would be completely justified in stripping them of German citizenship.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m unsure of any  difference  between assimilation and integration. At any rate, I&rsquo;d much prefer that they do neither. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want them integrated among us in western societies. Let them keep their own ways and remain apart! They should remain separate and distinct   &mdash;   the more separate the better.</p>
<p>Assimilation/integration means miscegenation.  And that in turn means the extinction of the native population&#8221;&rsquo; both genetically and culturally.</p>

<p>___________________________</p>
<p>Agreed.  That is why  (if I HAVE to choose), I would greatly prefer multi-culturalism over assimilation. Multi-culturalism at least keeps them separate and allows the host population to survive intact and undiluted.</p>
<p>Assimilation, however, works both ways,  50/50:  while you assimilate them, they also assimilate YOU.  That is inevitable. A Germany with millions  of &#8220;assimilated&#8221; Turks would no longer be German.</p>
<p>But why have to choose  between either multi-culturalism OR  assimilation? Why either one?  How about neither?  </p>
<p>Why not a Europe for Europeans?   Is that heretical thought so unthinkable in the twenty-first century?  Where is it mandated that all European nations must be destroyed?  And who mandated it?</p>

		<p>Erdogan speaks as though giving up the Turkish culture would present an enormous hardship on people who have left Turkey. Western societies are frequently reminded of what an enrichment migration from the Third World is supposed to be, and some Westerners even adopt some of the ways of these cultures, ie, converting to Islam. What I always wonder about this is, if Third World cultures are so great, why are so many people who come from these countries leaving for the West? One would think that these rich cultures would at least produce livable countries. Erdogan encourages the Turks to become professors, politicians, etc. in Germany, while continuing to embrace their Turkishness. He&rsquo;d be doing far better if he focused on the problems in Turkey which are making so many Turks leave the country, and the reasons why they don&rsquo;t have the opportunities to become well-educated professionals back in Instanbul. If Turkey was a better place to live, they might not need to set up voting booths in Germany. </p>

		<p>Fred, the atrocities you mentioned are just the beginning of the Turks&rsquo; aggression against Europeans. They invaded Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary. Brutal invasions, mass enslavement, and genocide was what these peoples fought back against for centuries. For two hundred years the Ukrainians fought one murderous war after another to expel the Turks. The Cossacks killed Turks and other Muslims as enemies of the Mothlerland, that is Russia. The Poles too had to fight long and hard to expel and kill all Muslims in their lands. Millions of Slavic women and girls were abducted and forced into sexual slavery, that is why you see some Turks with blond and red hair, not to mention fair skin and light colored eyes. Let&rsquo;s not forget the Greeks, who hate Islam and the Turks with a venom that has to be seen to be believed. They were particularly nasty to them, they even blew up many of the historical sites in Greece, including the Parthenon. That is why the U.S. has had troops in Cyprus for over 40 years, to keep the Greeks and Turks apart and from slaughtering each other. All Slavs and the Turks have been hereditary enemies for these reasons, as well as the Turks forced imposition of Islam and the creation of hostile colonies in their midst. That is why I admire Vlad the Impaler, he impaled tens of thousands of Turks and slaughtered entire armies. He was so fearsomely cruel and brutal even the Turkish Sultan Mehmed II was send home packing after seeing a forest of 20,000 impaled, dead and very ripe Turks on stakes in around Vlad&rsquo;s burned out capital city. If it wasn&rsquo;t for him, Germany and perhaps the rest of Europe too might well be Eurabia by now. He was the only one who stood and fought the Muslims while the rest of the Europeans fought among themselves. Erdogen has no right to talk about the rights of minorities, because Europeans are not going to stand for being a persecuted minority in their own land. </p>

		<p>there is an important difference between integration and assimilation, as I can testify for my own experience as the US American who was lived in Germany &amp; the US for 15 years:</p>
<p>I have absolutely NO desire to assimilate - to become a &#8220;German&#8221; - and I feel no pressure to do so.</p>
<p>Americans are well-liked in Germany, and most Germans want me to say American so they can enjoy my Americanness!!</p>
<p>I am well integrated: I speak German fluently, am established professionally, pay taxes and participate fully in cultural and social life here.</p>
<p>most Muslims in Europe are neither integrated or simulated:</p>
<p>they have set up parallel societies, essentially hostile enclaves, many of which are no go zones for the police and military, and all of them are reservoirs of for criminal activity, drugs, gangs, and all are fully dependent economically on welfare handouts.</p>
<p>this is essentially Eurabia, conquered territory that will need to be reconquered block by block, building by building, assuming Europeans grow enough spine soon enough.</p>
<p>the problems Germany faces regarding Muslim immigration are quite serious, but they are almost harmless compared to what France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and some of the Scandinavian countries have to deal with, for the simple reason that there are huge differences between the Turks on the one hand and Arabs and north Africans on the other.</p>
<p>I live in a neighborhood that is heavily Turkish, but would never in a million years live in a neighborhood that was majority and North African!!</p>
<p>Erdogan is arrogant and hypocritical, and should be smacked down hard by German politicians.</p>
<p>but some of what he&rsquo;s saying is quite positive:<br>
encouraging some Turks to return to Turkey left because of political turmoil, encouraging Turks in Germany to educate themselves and their children, learn German, and participate economically.</p>
<p>trade between Turkey and Germany is a win for both countries, but Turkey should no more they visit to the European Union then Botswana or Bolivia.</p>
<p>too many Turkish Germans are illiterate peasants, in this sense much like the Mexicans that are flooding into the US these days.</p>
<p>a sizable majority of Turks are educated and integrated, and some are indeed well assimilated too.</p>
<p>Europe is going to have to start the arduous process of sorting the wheat from the chaff as regards European Muslims - many are wonderful and productive citizens, but the majority are hopeless, and should be deported if possible - even at the cost of gigantic bribes for each reemigrant.<br>

		<p>Erdogan&rsquo;s undisguised arrogance has been made possible by the european elites headlong rush to make Turkey a member state of the EU becoming ever more certain by the day.Europe is being both destroyed from within,and encircled by a hostile crescent from without,as Islamist fanatics replace the old-time tyrants. </p>

		<p>Never mind Assimiation. Deportation is the only answer here. </p>
<p>Most Germans have been hit over the head since childhood to downplay, and even turn against their own Race, due to their loss in World War II. That was the idea when Britain, America, and the Soviet Union went to war with Germany and Italy, in the first place. Just look at Heidi Klum as one disgusting example. </p>
<p>These criminals wanted to end &#8220;Nationalism&#8221;, especially in White Western Countries, and they managed that just fine; all while imposing Marxist Socialism on the defeated people. So after so many generations, this is what they have been force fed to believe. </p>
<p>Somebody should do their homework and rediscover that the U.S. fought &#8220;Racist&#8221; Germany with a Segregated Army, and that no White man of that era would have served with Blacks, or other non-Whites, in the Military. These Marxists beat that out of self-aware White American, too. </p>
<p>When Germans from Germany know that they can talk freely to people, they always preface their conversation with, &#8220;I am not a Nazi but&hellip;&#8221;. </p>
<p>Why the preface at all? What makes wanting to preserve your own Race, Culture, and Country into Nazism, and why aren&rsquo;t the Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese called Nazis for their defense of the same? </p>
<p>If anyone knows even the slightest bit of German, then they know that the word, &#8220;Nazi&#8221; is short for &#8220;Nationalist&#8221; in German. Again, Nationalism and the Culture it wants to defend are under attack. </p>
<p>Just for educational purposes, the people here should buy and read the book called, &#8220;The Insiders&#8221; to better understand what and who are behind this mess. Then have your children read it, and then pass it on to your relatives and friends. </p>

		<p>&ldquo;Germany is home to around 2.7 million people of Turkish heritage who first came in the 1960s to help rebuild the country after the second world war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notice how they phrase it as if the Turks were doing the Germans a favor. In reality, they were guest workers (gastarbeiter), brought in because the German economic recovery (Wirstschafftwunder) had created a severe shortage of low-skill labor, and their wages in Germany were a multiple of the wages they could get at home in Turkey. Of course, the defining feature of an actual guest is that he leaves when he&rsquo;s asked to.<br>
Today they have a much higher rate of unemployment than the native Germans, breed more, and impose more costs on Germany&rsquo;s extensive welfare state. As Thilo Sarrazin pointed out, the number of foreign people in Germany has risen considerably since the 1970s, but the number of foreign workers has risen negligibly.</p>
<p>Incidentally, there is a large parallel between Turkey and Mexico, in terms of their governments&rsquo; policies. Both are ruled by mostly light-skinned, Caucasian-looking elites who use immigration to wealthier countries as a safety valve to get rid of the most potentially troublesome (not surprisingly, the least white) of their people, while giving their government more influence abroad.</p>

		<p>In the last analysis immigration of &#8220;others&#8221; is always going to mean territorial loss to the host country or entity. Simply put, all culture to be considered real must have territory it controls in order to express itself, that is, have people to acknowledge it and practice its tenets. Muslims must have land and control over it to feel valid; and just as Jews learned over centuries the alternative is subjugation even if tradition is energetically kept alive.<br>
I cannot see an alternative to a hollowing out of all European host countries. National humiliation, in short. </p>

		<p>In the last 8 years, Germany has 150% more immigrants, but exactly the same number of immigrants who actually work.</p>
<p>150% more welfare cases. Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful? Before you know it, Germany will look like Detroit! Won&rsquo;t that be great? My mother was born in Detroit, in a lovely little working class neighbourhood. That same neighbourhood is a burnt out  wasteland, where no light skinned person would be caught dead&hellip; wait, caught dead doesn&rsquo;t make a nice impression - it would be more like, caught alive for 30 seconds before being robbed and shot in the head. The small wood-clad houses, built after the war, are all falling in, and nobody in their right mind would relocate there, let alone walk there during the day&hellip; If Germany has as much luck as the USA, The Marxists will finish getting their message of Multiculturalism through the heads of everyone who has a small shred of personal and GERMAN cultural identity left, and Germany can look like a burnt out wasteland, just like Detroit does. Won&rsquo;t that be wonderful? Before that happens, I will personally put the  &#8220;Wall&#8221; back up, to keep the immigrants out of MY part of Germany. </p>
<p>My neighbours and friends are thrilled that I have integrated.They are amazed and flattered that I have learned to speak German almost perfectly. They are completely flabbergasted that I can write it without very many spelling errors or mistakes. And they have accepted me as one of them. I am the only foreigner in two local clubs, that are invitation only. The only thing that they like to say, once in a while, is that they hope that I never lose the last little vestige of my &#8220;Canadian accent&#8221; - it is what makes me unique in their eyes, and it&rsquo;s the only way that they can tell that I am from somewhere else. They find it exotic, eh&hellip; </p>
<p>At work, I have an Italian co-worker. His Mum and Dad came to Germany in the 1960&rsquo;s. They came first to find work, and built a successful life, bringing their young son here after 2 years wait. They worked like hell, and never took a penny of welfare. He works, and his wife works. No German would EVER compare an Italian Gastarbeiter with a Turkish welfare case. The first Turks, too, also worked in low paying, low skilled jobs, some of their children going on to establish businesses - much like the Canadian dream of successful immigration and integration. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the Turks who are coming now, from, as one person already commented, backward radical Muslim villages in the middle of nowhere, who are in Germany for a free ride. The number of official immigrants is very low. But if you go to Koeln for instance, and do a little math in your head, walking through the streets, or going into a shopping centre, you would have a very hard time imagining that there are only 2,7 million Turks in Germany. There are tonnes and tonnes of illegals, and not only from Turkey. All the people who come from absolutely  impoverished countries, claim refugee status and never pay another dime for anything, including cable television, that broadcasts programming in their language. It&rsquo;s really just like California, as one reader pointed out. </p>
<p>Anyways, look to former East Germany. After years of living with the Russian boot on their necks, they feel, to a man, that they paid their reparations already with their freedom. They had so many years of Russian propaganda, there just isn&rsquo;t any more room for Western Marxist &#8220;you&rsquo;re guilty because you&rsquo;re white&#8221; garbage propaganda. After years of having that stuff shoveled down my craw at school and University, I must say, it&rsquo;s very refreshing! Kind of ironic that the former Russian occupation will actually help prevent the complete loss of German identity&hellip; until the fast breeding immigrants turn Germany into a Muslim state in 2050&hellip; too bad - it&rsquo;s a beautiful country, with a rich history and culture with hundreds of wonderful individual microcultures, united by one language, German. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want to learn to speak German, or who is too stupid to learn it after, say, 3 years (more than generous), should simply be sent back to where they came from. And everyone who takes that mandatory language course, should have to pay for it out of their own pockets, EXACTLY as I was required to do. In the meantime, I will keep paying my income taxes to keep trying, over and over and over, to teach immigrants who are simply too stupid to EVER learn German. Half the people in my course could not even read and write in their own language!!!! What makes anyone think that all that welfare money is ever going to change anything? The first job that I had in Germany, paid less than other immigrants got on welfare. German wages are not overly inflated and it&rsquo;s possible for a working couple to work 40 hours a week each, and still have less money than the same couple who sits on their behinds all day on welfare. That would kind of get a person all riled up, don&rsquo;t you think? We just have to calculate the &#8220;riled up quotient&#8221; and weigh it against the &#8220;too bad you Germans didn&rsquo;t produce any children, Mohammed has 13 kids&#8221; quotient&hellip; Food for thought&hellip;          </p>
