			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Andy Dolan, Daily Mail (London), March 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Country dwellers believe rural communities should be the preserve of white middle-class families with conservative values, a survey claims. </p>
<p>Many residents of countryside towns and villages consider them the &#8216;last bastion&rsquo; of old-fashioned English traditions.</p>
<p>And they often equate this &#8216;exclusively and unthinkingly&rsquo; with white Englishness, a study has found.</p>
<p>Academics at Leicester University interviewed hundreds of residents from rural communities across England to discover what they considered to be the modern rural idyll. </p>
<p>They found that the popular vision of English country life is &#8216;essentially monocultural, in all its forms  &mdash;  white, heterosexual, middle-class, conformist, family-orientated, church-going, conservative and &#8216;safe&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Jon Garland and Neil Chakraborti, the senior lecturers in criminology who carried out the research, said: &#8216;The countryside was, for a number of those we spoke to, the last bastion of old-fashioned Englishness which needed to be preserved from the encroachment of the &#8220;evils&#8221; of late modernity.</p>
<p>&#8216;Minority ethnic incomers were often treated with suspicion as many white rural residents felt that they belonged only in the city, with all its concomitant &#8216;negative&rsquo; attributes of noise, pollution, crime and, crucially for some, multiculturalism. </p>
<p>&#8216;The rural, in their eyes, was an escape from all of those things, and the presence of a minority ethnic family suggested that the city was somehow invading the space of the tranquil rural they so treasured.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The academics said that ethnic minorities living in villages &#8216;often felt the full force of hostility&rsquo; and frequently experienced feelings of isolation, not only from their immediate communities but from fellow ethnic minority residents, &#8216;scattered&rsquo; across large rural areas.</p>
<p>Many also felt &#8216;forgotten&rsquo; by the justice system, with agencies refusing to take their victimisation seriously, &#8216;believing that racism could not be a problem in their area as the number of minority ethnic people living there was relatively low&rsquo;. </p>
<p>The research, conducted in stages over the last decade, involved interviewing hundreds of residents in the streets, at village events or in focus groups in rural communities across the Midlands and East Anglia. </p>
<p>Dr Chakraborti, who is of Indian descent, encountered verbal abuse during the study. </p>
<p>And since the findings have been published, the researchers have received letters of abuse and even a death threat, apparently from residents who feel the pair&rsquo;s work challenges the &#8216;very idea of Englishness itself&rsquo;. </p>
<p>Mr Garland said: &#8216;We spoke to many white people who had no problem living alongside ethnic minorities, and even some minorities who enjoyed standing out as they did in their rural communities. </p>
<p>&#8216;But around two-thirds of the minorities that we spoke to had experienced some sort of hostility or racism from their white neighbours.</p>
<p>&#8216;For many people, notions of Englishness are very much bound up with images of an unspoilt countryside and its gently undulating landscape of farms, cottages and hedgerows, itself a very nostalgic form of national identity redolent of an England left behind many decades ago.&rsquo; </p>
<p>The producer of ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders caused controversy earlier this month when he admitted keeping ethnic minority characters out of the show&rsquo;s storylines because &#8216;it wouldn&rsquo;t be an English village&rsquo; if there was any racial diversity.</p>

<p>Did these &#8220;academics&#8221; also do a study to see what native Whites experienced after suddenly becoming a minority in their neighborhoods? Of course not! I&rsquo;m quite sure they also felt &#8220;the full force of hostility&#8221; and &#8220;feelings of isolation&#8221; from their new &#8220;ethnic&#8221; neighbors and White liberals!</p>
<p>*Many also felt &lsquo;forgotten&rsquo; by the justice system, with agencies refusing to take their victimisation seriously - </p>
<p>Again, Whites feel &#8216;forgotten&rsquo; by the justice system ( Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder ) that refuse to take their victimization seriously!</p>

		<p>Great news and the reason why the Left is Cosmopolitan. It&rsquo;s how they ruined Quebec. Too much urbanization leads to an imbalance because farmers are more atuned to reality bc of their lifestyle close to nature, hence traditionalists are always anti-Cosmopolitan. The perfect ethnicity is 30% urban &amp; 70% rural of which app: half are mountaineers/herders &amp; half lowland peasants by ancestry. E.Europe comes to mind esp. Orthodox Slavs.</p>

		<p>&#8221; &lsquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t be an English village&rsquo; if there was any racial diversity.&#8221;: This is correct, but the sentiment of this comment needs to be reversed to say: Where you have racial diversity, you can&rsquo;t have England. It is different. It is the people who define a nation.  I would agree that only White English can make an English villiage and the same goes for their nation. Either England comes to grips with deporting all non-English or England dies.  The current state of having multi-culturalism is an inbetween point of the two possible ending options. It is still possible, although unlikely, that they will change their path and choose to remain English.  I find it more likely that their non-White, Islamic immigrants will eventually choose a different outcome for the native English, as well as choose a new name for the future nation-state once called England.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, I&rsquo;m beginning to see signs where a violent immigrant backlash could occur in Europe in the near future, which could well curtail elitist plans for further Western destruction.  But not so in the US.  At least not for a while longer.  But that could change.</p>
<p>And the situation in both places is dependent upon how far the global economy plummets in the next couple of years.  It hasn&rsquo;t fallen as quickly as expected, but IT IS falling nonetheless.</p>
<p>Terrorist attacks by Ghadffi could well accelerate an anti immigrant eruption, but it would have to be extensive and intense.  It takes a lot to get whitey riled up, but when he&rsquo;s finally had enough heads begin to roll with great enthusiasm and regularity.</p>
<p>There are many variables at play, but when bad things occur they occur quickly, as if they were unexpected all along.  </p>

		<p>Maybe &#8220;countryside&#8221; knows something the cosmopolitan elites across Europe are only belatedly figuring out: Multiculturalism is a failure:</p>
<p>David Cameron, Prime Minister of Great Britain: </p>
<p>&#8220;Under the doctrine of state multiculturalism, we have encouraged different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream. We&rsquo;ve failed to provide a vision of society to which they feel they want to belong. We&rsquo;ve even tolerated these segregated communities behaving in ways that run completely counter to our values.&#8221; (Speech, Feb. 5, 2011): <br>
http://tinyurl.com/6h9gwea</p>
<p><br>
Angela Merkel, German Chancellor:</p>
<p>At &#8220;the beginning of the 1960s our country called the foreign workers to come to Germany and now they live in our country. We kidded ourselves a while. We said: &#8216;They won&rsquo;t stay, [after some time] they will be gone,&rsquo; but this isn&rsquo;t reality. And of course, the approach [to build] a multicultural [society] and to live side by side and to enjoy each other &hellip; has failed, utterly failed.&#8221;<br>
(&#8220;Germany&rsquo;s Angela Merkel: Multiculturalism has &#8216;utterly failed,&rsquo;&#8221; October, 2010, Christian Science Monitor):<br>

<p>Nicolas Sarkozy, President of France: </p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a failure. The truth is that, in all our democracies, we&rsquo;ve been too concerned about the identity of the new arrivals and not enough about the identity of the country receiving them.&#8221; <br>

		<p>The English countryside, for those who don&rsquo;t know England well, is a small scale and intimate landscape every inch of which has been inhabited and worked for millenia by the ancestors of the very people who still inhabit it. It is therefore a landscape of great antiquity marked by the tombs and monuments of every age, where even the lines of  today&rsquo;s hedges and lanes may go back to pre-Roman times. That was why our former Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, said that the countryside IS England in a way which our towns and cities - even great and historic cities such as London -  can never be. That in turn is why many English people feel an almost mystical attachment to our countryside and to its Englishness.</p>
<p>Through all the long decades of mass foreign immigration into our towns and cities the countryside has remained the stronghold of the English people, our identity and traditions, and yet, in the past few years the stronghold has been breached. That is why country dwellers are so admirably racialist.</p>

		<p>These studies of Englishness are always critical about the ways English people are preserving their ethnicity. I never seem to read of any forms of English identity that are approved by the authorities. Even the English flag is often restricted. Shouldn&rsquo;t the onus be on the researchers to give some examples of acceptable ways for English people to be English? Before being so negative and critical, the researchers should provide a description of what it means to be English.</p>

<p>Say it enough and it becomes true.  That is the angle this paragraph plays on.  &#8220;&hellip;left behind many decades ago.&#8221;  Oh, really?  How many decades ago?  Who decided to leave Englishness behind and for what?  I expect that the next pronouncement will be that the Royal Family must consider intermarrying with Pakistanis and Africans, or end the British Monarchy.</p>
<p>I hope that the true British will rise up and throw out these people who are destroying them and their nation.</p>

		<p><b>Heaven forbid - an English countryside populated by the English, of all things!</b></p>
<p>I sometimes wonder if the UK hadn&rsquo;t stripped two of its branches of government (the Monarch and the (pre-Blair) House of Lords) of their power if the death of Britain would have been allowed?  When faced with disposing their heirs of their birth right would they have gone along?  For that matter does the King of Sweden want to be King of the Somalis?  Does the Queen of the Netherlands want to convert to Muslim?  Is representative government really representative of the people&rsquo;s wishes (take the US for instance)?  Universal suffrage and rule by petty, selfish, greedy politicians who give no thought to their posterity hasn&rsquo;t done us a lick of good.  And in fact may have doomed us.<br>

		<p>Dr Chakraborti, who is of Indian descent, encountered verbal abuse during the study. He is a senior lecturer in criminology but makes no comment about immigrant crime, and considering he is from Leicester, a city with many Indian residents and which has a very high crime rate, perhaps we should look at the racial attitude by Indians to other Indians in their home country. India was among the first countries to condemn Apartheid in South Africa, criticizing the evil idea of White dominance over Blacks, Coloureds and Indians. However, India boasts the most class-ridden apartheid system in the world, and, unlike Chakraborti&rsquo;s imported alien view on White England, they do not need alien immigrants to lecture them about this and their long established racist caste system. The word caste itself is homologous with any of three different indigenous terms. Varna, which was an ancient, all-India classification system consisting of a fourfold division of society, perhaps arose out of a blending of the nomadic Warrior culture of Aryans with the settled urban, agrarian culture of the Indus Valley. The religious text Rig Veda spells out and justifies this stratification system, putting the Brahman or priest at the top, followed by the Kshatriya or warrior, Vaisya or landowner and trader, and Shudra or artisan and servant, in that order. Later a fifth varna of Untouchables developed, called Panchama, to accommodate intercaste offspring. The word caste may also be coterminous with the word jati, which is a hereditary occupational unit. Hindu texts say that jatis, of which there are several thousand, emerged out of Intermarriages between varnas. Modern theory holds that jatis developed as other social groups like tribes or those practicing a new craft or occupational skill became integrated into the classic varna system. This process continues today as groups on the fringes of Hindu society become part of it by claiming a jati designation. Lastly, caste may refer to gotra, which is an exogenous descent group within a jati. It may be anchored territorially, and its members may hold property in common. Underpinning the entire system are notions of purity and pollution. Words for these two ideas occur in every Indian language. Each term has a certain amount of semantic fluidity. Pure means &#8220;clean, spiritually meritorious, holy&#8221;; impure means &#8220;unclean, defiled,&#8221; and even &#8220;sinful.&#8221; The structural distance between castes is measured in terms of purity and pollution; higher castes are pure in their occupation, diet, and life-style. Caste rules govern intercaste relations, determining the social and physical distance that people of different castes have to maintain from each other and their rights and obligations toward others. An equally important feature of caste rank is the notion of serving and being served, of giving and receiving. Castes may be ranked by the balance between the intercaste transactions in which one caste is a giver and those in which it is a receiver of goods, services, gifts, or purely Spiritual merit. The seeming contradiction between the power and position of the Brahman versus that of the king or the Politically and economically dominant caste can be resolved in light of the transactional aspect of caste, which creates varied realms of differentiation and ranking. Well Dr. Chakraborti, please explain all this and why you are in England anyway, pursuing a career totally unrecognised in your perfect and unsullied homeland. </p>

		<p>To Yorkshireman:</p>
<p>I am very interested in your analysis.  For some time I have been looking for a good authority that explains the migration of the Indo-Aryans into India millennia ago and how their racial and cultural influences can still be seen today.  Could you perhaps recommend a good book on this subject?</p>

		<p>Hey!  The English countryside sounds like it&rsquo;s got its own vibrant, authentic ethnic culture!  I thought the SWPLs were about all things authentic and ethnic.  How come cultural leftists only like ancient, unsullied cultures when they&rsquo;re not white?</p>
<p>God save England!</p>

There are many excellent sources of information, too numerous for me to list here, and, in any case, it would be too far off-topic. You could try this link which has historical origin references.<br>

		<p>The real racism is denying whites their right to remain white. Evil lurks. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Multiculturalism&#8221; seems to only celebrate cultures that are anything but &#8220;white heterosexual christian&#8221; as if such a culture must be excluded while all other kinds of cultures replace it. Everyone else must have protected cultures, but not white straight christian folks. Cajuns are very familiar with the concept of cultural destruction and foreign replacement. It happened to us when American schools forbade us from speaking French, and now those same schools give Mexican students their own Spanish-language classes! Many Cajuns of newer generations are limited French proficient and our culture is suffering for it. By the way, blacks that claim to be Cajun are lying.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t you just wonder how this will turn out, say a hundred years from now? At some point it will become apparent and admitted by the MSM that white civilization is unique and can&rsquo;t be recreated by inserting a few Africans or Chinese with the right value system. I&rsquo;m sorry to say I think the whole thing can&rsquo;t be stopped, that all that will remain will be pockets of whites. Maybe someday there will be tour buses (or whatever they&rsquo;ll be driving)going through white areas, like they do near me in rural Ohio with the Amish.</p>

		<p>My God, they can&rsquo;t even leave the English countryside alone, can they?  The multiculturalists must have everything.  They seem bent on leaving nothing to homogenity and tradition.</p>
