<h1>First Amendment Exception for &#8220;Racially Hostile or Contemptuous Speech&#8221;</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Eugene Volokh, Volokh Conspiracy (blog), March 14, 2011 12:00 pm</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As I blogged a few months ago, a two-judge majority on a Sixth Circuit panel held in Defoe v. Spiva that there was such an exception; to quote the panel,<blockquote>A public high school that can put reasonable limits on drug-related speech by students [referring to Morse v. Frederick, which upheld such restrictions   &mdash;  EV] can put reasonable and even-handed limits on racially hostile or contemptuous speech, without having to show that such speech will result in disturbances. Expressions of racial hostility can be controlled in the public schools even if students in the attacked racial group happen to be mature, goodnatured, and slow to react. Schools are places of learning and not cauldrons for racial conflict. Moreover, expression of racial hostility can be controlled in the public schools even though such expressions are constitutionally permitted in newspapers, public parks, and on the street. Public school students cannot simply decide not to go to school.<br>
</blockquote>Of course, under Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. School. Dist (1969), all student speech  &mdash;  whether racially offensive or not  &mdash;  could be restricted if there is substantial reason to think that the speech will likely cause a material disruption. But the panel majority here concluded that &#8220;racially hostile or contemptuous speech,&#8221; including the display of a confederate flag, can be punished <em>even without such a showing of likely disruption.</em></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>And the wearing of a confederate flag does send a political message, and certainly a comment on a &#8220;political or social issue&#8221;  &mdash;  whether the message is that the Confederacy was right to secede, that the South should be proud of its Confederate heritage, or that white supremacy is a good idea. The intended and likely understood message may vary from context to context, but the message remains political.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sixth Circuit just rejected a petition for rehearing en banc, over a dissent by Judge Boggs; here are the opening paragraphs of that dissent:</p>
<p>The panel majority eviscerates the core holding of Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969)  &mdash;  that student speech can be suppressed only based on its disruptive potential, not on its content. There is no indication in Tinker that its rules are any different if the speech at issue is deemed, by either a school or an appellate court, to be offensive, &#8220;hostile,&#8221; or &#8220;contemptuous.&#8221; See Defoe v. Spiva, 625 F.3d 324, 338 (6th Cir. 2010). Nor is there any indication that such a judgment would change the basic First Amendment values that Tinker enshrines.</p>
<p>The panel majority rests its remarkable conclusion on Morse v. Frederick, 551 U.S. 393 (2007), where the Court found the speech in question  &mdash;  a 14-foot banner with the message &#8220;BONG HiTS 4 JESUS&#8221;  &mdash;  to be promoting illegal drug use. {snip}</p>
<p>[The] majority opinion asserts that this case is controlled by Morse because &#8220;racially hostile or contemptuous&#8221; can be substituted for &#8220;illegal drug use.&#8221; Defoe, 625 F.3d at 338  &mdash;  39 (&#8220;If we substitute &#8216;racial conflict&rsquo; or &#8216;racial hostility&rsquo; for &#8216;drug abuse,&rsquo; the analysis in Morse is practically on all fours with this case.&#8221;). That is grammatically true, but it is equally true if you substitute &#8220;religious dogma,&#8221; &#8220;Republican propaganda,&#8221; or &#8220;seditious libel.&#8221; Morse does not authorize suppression on any of those grounds either, but the panel&rsquo;s ipse dixit reading of Morse would support such a holding just as strongly as the one it makes.</p>

<p>The only kind of students who could be so insulted and react maturely, slowly and in a good nature are whites.  I might have also said Asians, but today&rsquo;s UCLA story here on AmRen belies that.  And as we all know, non-whites who slur whites in public schools are rarely punished.</p>

		<p>If the Confederate flag would fall under &#8216;racially hostile and contemptuous&#8221;, where does that leave &#8216;Malcolm X&rsquo; hats, Mexican flag bandanas, Asian-pride shirts, etc.?  Tolerated, no doubt.  I see double-standard written all over this.</p>

<p>NONE of this is what the Confederate flag stands for today. The flag means a person who is non-conformist and who does not go with the flow. Does his own thing but is not necessarily racist, whatever that word means. My perception.</p>

		<p>I would have thought that any speech with the clear potential to cause distruptive behavior which could impede the educational process and even lead to violence could be banned by any American school system.</p>
<p>Students don&rsquo;t enjoy unfettered rights while on school property  during school hours.  They should and must be subject to rules and disciplinary measures designed to foster the learning process.</p>
<p>That these rules and disciplinary measures are far more relaxed that they were a generation or two ago largely accounts for the dismal showing of American students in international educational standings.</p>

		<p>It depends what they have a right to.   Nothing a person has a right to should be removed as punishment for his speech, even in a school, even in a courtroom actually. </p>
<p><br>
If you are on someones property and espouse a view that they don&rsquo;t like, such as that &#8220;Obama was born in Hawaii&#8221;, that person can demand that you leave. It is a punishment for what you said, but he is not taking away anything you have a right to, because you have no right to stay on his land any longer than is reasonable to gather your things and leave.<br>
The school should be allowed to remove him from areas of the school, but he doesn&rsquo;t have any right to be in any area of the school he wishes so it is not a violation of his rights.</p>
<p><br>
If for some reason they have a right to keep him in the school, for example he would be a danger to himself or others if he were allowed to roam about, then they can keep him somewhere against his will.<br>
If he has a right to freely travel, then they should not be taking that away as punishment for something he spoke.  If he admits a likelihood of shooting people, then it would be ok for someone to keep him from freely traveling, as this is necessary to protect other people.</p>
<p>False threats do not even have to be illegal maybe. One could be detained though after admitting something that makes it appear likely he is a danger to others. That is not punishment.</p>
<p>True threats should never have been illegal.  There is even less justifaction for punishing them than there are for false threats i think.  <br>

		<p>Tedious article.  But, it featured good material for a quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;that the Confederacy was right to secede, that the South should be proud of its Confederate heritage, or that white supremacy is a good idea&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course these are three taboo &#8220;thoughts&#8221; in our world.</p>

		<p>Ban free speech in public schools? How about banning public schools instead.</p>
<p>If we had private schools (like we have private restaurants, hardware stores, etc.), they could permit, or ban, whatever they pleased. And if you didn&rsquo;t like one, you could take your business to another.</p>
<p>However, public schools work on a zone principle where you send your kids to the school in your zone. The whole point is to protect bad schools by keeping you from sending your kids to better schools that are further away.</p>

		<p>For The Children!</p>
<p>We must _Save_ _The_ _Children_!</p>
<p>PROTECT ALL THE CHILDREN!</p>
<p>Anytime you see such a blatant pseudo-empathic appeal for the protection of the weak, you can pretty much guarantee which group brought the case to court that we might all blindly chant along with the verdict.</p>
<p>The problem with legal systems is that they are both too application generalist and too historically associative.</p>
<p>You end up making law after law based on &#8216;compareable precedent&rsquo; as defined by the specific terms and testimony given in the case until every possible conditional match is made and using Westlaw or some other semantic database, you can construct a pastiche that justifies restricting whatever you want.</p>
<p>Even if it remains utter rubbish as a quilt of many colors but no rational pattern.  As here.</p>
<p>&#8220;People should stop breathing!  See right here, it shows that smokers who breathed in, died.  Stop it I say, it&rsquo;s potentially dangerous!&#8221;</p>
<p>Real law is that which is made in the condition where it&rsquo;s applied as useful for -that condition only-.  Not any others.</p>
<p>Now that they have created a precedent for kids where there is &#8216;no displayed intent or likelihood of disturbance&rsquo;, the next leap of fuzzy logic will be: &#8220;If it&rsquo;s safe to outlaw it for kids where there is no possibility of harm, then it&rsquo;s safe to outlaw it on street corners where a permit is sought for a public demonstration and unruly adults without a teacher pinching their ears might take real offense and beat each other up&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Or on the internet where it can logically be stated that those of like minds come together to &#8216;hate&rsquo; what is going on without knowing that one of them has overt psychotic tendencies and will use their Hate Speech (whatever that is) as inspiration for violent criminality.</p>
<p>Which is why I think that we walk a downhill slope to Hades with &#8216;definitions&rsquo; of legality linked to emotional states to begin with.  If it&rsquo;s physically dangerous, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what your mental state is, the crime lies in the danger posed by your immediate actions, not your state of mind before doing them.</p>
<p>(See: the terrible consequences to allowing murders to go unpunished due to &#8216;emotional distress&rsquo; or &#8216;insanity&rsquo;&hellip;)</p>
<p>OTOH, how do you rationally measure the intensity of belief as a gauge for legality of consequences in someone who doesn&rsquo;t have the gift of language skills to be diplomatic or in situations where there is no room or time for diplomacy?</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish all illegal immigrants would stop consuming benefits intended for legal citizens, and cease lessening our people&rsquo;s culture and economic standing by leaving our country.  But I don&rsquo;t think it will ever happen because I think corporate socialism, as proof of profit not principle, is bent on turning our nation into the Third World by providing both free wellfare and open borders to increase consumerism and depress wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten men agree with me.</p>
<p>That sounds harmless and would be ignored because it&rsquo;s only ten men.  But let one man label someone as unwanted because their dorsal side got damp doing an illegal backstroke and they should high themselves back home to the narcostate they came from, LOUDLY, and suddenly you are facing a condition where TEN MILLION people might agree with him.</p>
<p>With Equal Enthusiasm.</p>
<p>And politicians would have to _listen_ to that &#8216;hate filled&rsquo; speech because more people would sympathize with it&rsquo;s implicit emotions than the rational one.</p>
<p>This is why labelling an emotion illegal is dangerous.  Because politicians, like little children, never listen until and unless the threat of ANGER is implied, with all it&rsquo;s real (fire your behind) consequences.</p>
<p>And so to insulate themselves from having to think about the consequences of acting in their own best interests as opposed to those of society at large (as the people who hired them) they outlaw BOTH types of speech as argumentative disagreement with their policies.</p>
<p>Hence it should be:  Save us -FROM- The Children.  For we know not what we do when we elect them to rule over us as both thieves and slave owners.</p>
<p>They steal our rights to complain and then they sell our lives.  </p>
<p>Cheap.</p>

		<p>Now if some kid stood up and ranted how he &#8220;HATES N****RS!&#8221; that would indeed be incendiary speech that should be banned in high school.  But what if he wanted to calmly and dispassionately discuss <i>The Bell Curve</i>?  Invariably some black student or some liberal white teacher would decide that that is racially hostile speech, and ban it.  Indeed, the basic problem is that the left defines any facts it doesn&rsquo;t like as &#8220;hate speech&#8221; and thus will make entire subjects off limits in high school.<br>
