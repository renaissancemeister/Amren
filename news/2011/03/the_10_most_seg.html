<h1>The 10 Most Segregated Urban Areas in America</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daniel Denver, Salon, March 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Decades after the end of Jim Crow, and three years after the election of America&rsquo;s first black president, the United States remains a profoundly segregated country.</p>
<p>That reality has been reinforced by the release of Census Bureau data last week that shows black and white Americans still tend to live in their own neighborhoods, often far apart from each other. Segregation itself, the decennial census report indicates, is only decreasing slowly, although the dividing lines are shifting as middle-income blacks, Latinos and Asians move to once all-white suburbs   &mdash;   whereupon whites often move away, turning older suburbs into new, if less distressed, ghettos.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The following is a list of the nation&rsquo;s most segregated metropolitan areas of over 500,000 people. The rankings are based on a dissimilarity index, a measure used by social scientists to gauge residential segregation. It reflects the number of people from one race   &mdash;   in this case black or white   &mdash;   who would have to move for races to be evenly distributed across a certain area. A score of 1 indicates perfect integration while 100 signals complete segregation. The rankings were compiled by John Paul DeWitt of CensusScope.org and the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Social Science Data Analysis Network.</p>

		<p> Note that in every case, segregation is portrayed as due to &#8220;White racism&#8221; and attempts by Whites to &#8220;keep blacks out.&#8221; Presumably every black family would like to live next door to a White one, if we would only let them. We all know that isn&rsquo;t true, but it&rsquo;s hard for the bleeding hearts to make their case if they have to acknowledge the fact that people of particular races and ethnic groups often want to live among people of their own kind   &mdash;   not in a hodge-podge neighborhood.</p>
<p> Also, could it just be that the the opposition of suburban Milwaukee Whites to urban mass transit being extended out into their neighborhoods is because they know from experience what it will bring? That is to say, hordes of black criminals, troublemakers, etc.</p>
<p> And a final point: It&rsquo;s interesting that the piece went out of its way to mention the 1917 East St. Louis race riots because it could logically blame them on the Whites. But it entirely ignored the Detroit race riots of 1943, in which the sides probably bore equal blame, and blacks actually started the violence. Wouldn&rsquo;t want to endanger the major point of the story: To depict blacks as always and everywhere poor, helpless victims of &#8220;White racism.&#8221; </p>

<p>In reality, the 1917 ESL riots were one of those &#8220;equal blame&#8221; affairs as well.  Those were the first years of black migration out of the South (most of it was between the two World Wars).  A lot of blacks from Mississippi settled in East St. Louis (but not St. Louis proper) because the train route from Mississippi to Chicago had a big stop-off in East St. Louis, but did not cross over the river into St. Louis.  </p>

		<p>I wont hold my breath waiting for the authorities or people of color to come up with a plan to make their neighborhoods, and the neighbors in their vibrant communities, more welcoming to white home buyers and renters, and visitors. They even have the advantage of lower mortgage payments, lower rent, and lower property tax, in these tough times, in many of these neighborhoods of color. It would be so easy for them to make an effort to lure more whites in. I wont hold my breath because it will never happened, and has never happened, that people of color have welcomed whites anywhere. </p>

<p>Because people want to be around their own, its human nature!  Be it personal beliefs, religion, lifestyles, and above all race.  That is why WASPs didn&rsquo;t want to be around Catholics at the turn of the previous century, like all the Mormons in Utah.  They had a choice, but now you take what you can get.  A white Catholic or WASP moving next door to me will always be more desirable than a black witch doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;a measure used by social scientists to gauge residential segregation.&#8221;</p>

		<p>If blacks did not have a crime rate that is eight times the white crime rate whites would not try so hard to avoid living next to them. <br>
 <br>
As I have gotten older I have come ruefully to suspect that Jim Crow legislation was based on sound instinct. If a state has a large black population it faces undesirable choices. Either it discriminates against all blacks, jeopardizing the minority that is morally responsible, or it gives all blacks equal rights, and suffers the social problems the United States has experienced since the civil rights legislation was signed. </p>

I believe the research for this article is based on the work of the University at Albany Mumford Center:</p>
<p><a href="https://mumford.albany.edu/mumford/" rel="nofollow">https://mumford.albany.edu/mumford/</a></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe they do the actual &#8216;research&rsquo; but they provide tools for people to calculate how much segregation their community has.</p>
<p>Every couple of years, it&rsquo;s announced that Buffalo (actually Buffalo-Niagara) is on the list of top ten most segregated urban areas. We&rsquo;ve usually been calculated at number 7. We have now been calculated to be number 6.</p>
<p>This research often takes on a life of its own. Although Buffalo (Niagara) has been listed as the 7th most segregated urban area, it&rsquo;s often retold by people as being the 7th (now 6th) most RACIST urban area. Often times, Buffalo (Niagara) is said to be THE MOST RACIST urban area by people who fret about such things and have an agenda.</p>
<p>This article quotes a University at Buffalo black professor, Henry Louis Taylor Jr., as saying that blacks and whites used to live together and apparently got along just fine. I&rsquo;ve never heard of this.</p>
<p>While I suspect there were areas IN TRANSITION where blacks and whites lived together, they were, as I said, likely only in TRANSITION; meaning that as whites were leaving and blacks were moving in, there was a point where it appeared to be fully integrated.</p>
<p>According to the Census, Buffalo and inner-ring suburbs are hemorrhaging people. </p>
<p>https://www.buffalonews.com/city/census/article377868.ece</p>
<p>Black professor Henry Louis Taylor Jr would have us believe that the new areas of TRANSITION represent a new fully integrated community.  Blacks are moving to the suburbs to flee their own dysfunctional communities which they are reproducing in suburban communities causing more &#8216;white flight&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Black crime in the suburbs is noticeably on the rise even though the Buffalo News tries to under report it. There have been home invasion, robberies, purse snatching, and murders in Cheektowaga and Amherst.</p>
<p>There is nothing new here. Blacks move in. Whites move out.<br>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that I don&rsquo;t understand.  If you have an area that has been one race only, say white, for centuries - without any blacks, asians, tibetans, latinos what have you, how can you call the white people racists, when they were the only race around and the other races never got there yet?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying Malawi is racist because there are so few latinos there!  </p>

		<p>What they are not saying in the map above is that we have in South Milwaukee a militant army of non citizen Hispanics who will never assimilate, who drove the blacks out of work along with working class whites and who stomp around like stormtroopers demanding their &#8220;rights.&#8221; This will end badly. What is more is the whole community bends over backwards to reward the black and hispanic  mob at the expense of middle class white life. Whites in Milwaukee are treated as second class citizens, period. Living here as been Hell and gets worse by the week. Like many whites I am looking for a safe place to work and live among my own . Fat chance.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the big surprise?  I like being around my own kind.  The place to look for real segregation is not where people choose to live - it&rsquo;s the CHURCHES where they choose to worship.  I&rsquo;ve been to Catholic and Protestant churches, and in the Catholic ones Hispanics and Asians have their own separate Masses on Sundays.  There are some blacks, but not many.  The Protestants, however, are almost all strictly segregated.  The blacks want their own churches (as do Asians and Hispanics).  The black church has been a safe haven for them for centuries, and it hasn&rsquo;t changed.  They want to be with their own kind, hear their own brand of religion, and talk about problems and experiences unique to their group.  The Asians and Hispanics are exactly the same.  So YES we&rsquo;re segregated - this is what people do BY CHOICE!! - long live segregation, and may more of it return!!!</p>

post #1, Tired Old White Guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve, noticed, you betchya&hellip;</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve written in the past on this forum, it&rsquo;s primarily northerners like myself, who are the real segregationists and am proud to say it. Residential segregation is generally the norm up here to the point where it&rsquo;s secretely institutional and is not limited to just the cities neither. This article really deals with examples of urban hypersegregation in which non-white&rsquo;s and blacks in particular, are relegated to certain core areas. </p>
<p>Consider the following a general outline of the  northern  defacto segregation model still in use today. By no means does this address all the details, but think it nails down the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221;. <br>
 <br>
  &mdash;   It&rsquo;s first accomplished by obscuring the issue of race, into the matrix of the social, political and especially, the economic machinery.<br>
  &mdash;   This in turn allows market forces &#8220;alone&#8221; to dominate and greatly influences who lives where.<br>
  &mdash;   Which in turn makes exspensive, even moderately exspensive residencies,(which are common up here), generally out out reach of most blacks and other non whites.  <br>
  &mdash;   Because it&rsquo;s essentially comes down to pure economics, so theoretically &#8220;anyone&#8221; can buy if then can afford it,-right? But it just so happens odds are you&rsquo;ll get a white neighbor&rsquo; -nod, nod, wink, wink. So you see, it&rsquo;s then pretty darned hard to confirm racist motives when you allow market forces to take their course. This helps create a rather efficient filtration system keeping non- whites numerically limited.  <br>
  &mdash;  And this is why northern urban hypersegreation exists and why it&rsquo;s so common&#8221; for suburban bedroom communities, (not inner ring), to be 95% plus white. <br>
- Now lets throw in social factors. Many whites up here have historically a rather low tolerance when it comes to living within close proximity to too many blacks and latinos. &#8220;Too many&#8221; might be an abstract term to use but trust me, it&rsquo;s a rather tight threshold. &#8220;There goes the neighborhood&#8221;. Can anyone say &#8220;For Sale&#8221;?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because until the 1920&rsquo;s, maybe even the 30&rsquo;s, many whites up here had little contact with blacks,- even in many cities! Some of my ancestors might have conributed to their liberation but we certainly didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with em. That&rsquo;s almost as true today as it ever was. Okay,- we got some payback. </p>
<p>This is basically the northern georaphic mosaic, but by the same token is not without exceptions and deviations and certainly I&rsquo;ve left stuff out. Nor, was it my intention to paint &#8220;up north&#8221; as some kind of defacto white homeland either. Blacks  indeed continue to penetrate northern suburbs, but to a rather limited extent compared to the south and this Latino thing is a complete wildcard. Unlike the blacks, Latinos seem to spread out everywhere in numbers- urban, suburban, rural, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.  </p>
<p> I just wanted to communicate the geograhic pulse and put into words and confirm to poster #1. No it ain&rsquo;t your imagination Tired Old White Guy.</p>

		<p>Never do you see a liberal white person with school age children move into a black neighborhood.  So this proves that liberal whites with children are a major cause of the new &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221;.  Be sure to inform Rachel Maddow and Chris Matthews about this so they can berate all those liberal white people with children.<br>

		<p>I would be interested to see statistics on black vs. Hispanic and black vs. Asian segregation. I know that in the Los Angeles, the interracial violence between blacks and Latinos didn&rsquo;t die down until the two ethnically cleansed each other from their respective neighborhoods. Of course, in MSM fantasyland that&rsquo;s only because whites &#8220;taught them&#8221; to be racist&hellip;</p>
<p>And, of course, nowhere do they ask why whites move away, other than to attribute the cause to &#8220;racism&#8221;. Maybe it&rsquo;s because, even controlling for socioeconomic status, blacks and Latinos are more likely than whites to commit crimes, especially violent crimes? Apart from the normal and natural desire to be around one&rsquo;s own people, of course, this could be a significant contributing factor. But no one is supposed to talk of such things.</p>

<p>Best not to have things that attract minorities. <br>
-Good schools and high paying jobs attract Asians. <br>
-Construction and agriculture jobs attract Mexicans.<br>
-Jobs, good weather, and low cost of living attract blacks. </p>

		<p>Some posters above say that people want to be around their own kind.  That would be great if it were true.  The truth is white people want to be around their own kind, and non-whites want to be around white people.  White people create the most desirable countries, societies, cities and neighborhoods, and blacks and other non-whites do their best to not have to be around their own kind, and move to where the white people are.</p>

		<p> &#8220;I&rsquo;ve always thought the word segregation means government mandated separation such as with Jim Crow laws or apartheid.&#8221;</p>
<p><br>
It means nothing more than separated and kept apart&hellip;whether by government mandate or by personal choice.</p>

		<p>These articles are always such nonsense. 85% white is not white enough for me, and yet they carry on in these articles that living with 15% minorities in your community is a segregated community. </p>

		<p>Of course, they blame it on whites, yet have problem if nonwhites are the ones wanting to be around their own kind.  I think are real enemies aren&rsquo;t the nonwhites who work against us.  They really don&rsquo;t have much power.  No, the real culprits are the white liberals and white elites in power who push this racial antagonism and guilt.  </p>

		<p>&hellip;Which in turn makes exspensive, even moderately exspensive residencies,(which are common up here), generally out out reach of most blacks and other non whites.</p>
<p> &mdash;  It essentially comes down to pure economics, so theoretically &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; can buy if then can afford it,-right?  But it just so happens that you&rsquo;ll get a white neighbor&rsquo; -nod, nod, wink, wink. So you see, it&rsquo;s then pretty darned hard to confirm racist motives when you allow market forces to take their course. This helps create a rather efficient filtration system keeping non- whites numerically limited.</p>

<p>Segregation by money is OK.  That&rsquo;s the one kind of segregation that&rsquo;s allowed.</p>
<p>WHY? Because the elites who control us, make  the rules, and run the show have MONEY.  Therefore, whatever they do is permissible   &mdash;    but not OK for the  Average Joe. </p>

		<p>Of they did one good thing in trying to gauge dissimilarity, it is that we now have these maps! Now we can see where the problem lies.</p>
<p>My only question is: why is this data compiled not itself &#8220;racist&#8221; when we are supposed to be blind to race, or race is supposed to be some non existent construct of the mind?</p>

		<p>If any rioting breaks out for ANY reason, it will quickly turn into &#8220;race riots&#8221; and when the riots are over, integrated neighborhoods will be few and far between.</p>
<p>The government is broke at every level.  When the elites start shutting off the welfare spigots, things are going to turn ugly for people in the gentrified areas of the inner cities, and in the working class neighborhoods with significant racial mixing.  </p>
<p>If riots break out, it will also spell the end of inter-racial dating and marriage.  People will only feel safe with their own people. </p>

		<p>Poster #24, Common Sense:  (1) I DO like being around my own kind - I am white, and I am most comfortable around whites.  What, am I lying?  Hardly!!!  (2) People of color DO NOT want to be around white people.  They want to be around what white people CREATE - clean, well-kept neighborhoods, nice shopping and restaurant areas, and clean, safe schools and churches.  Are you kidding?  They hate us - but they sure want our stuff, AND they want it without having to pay for it.  Y&rsquo;all stock up on food, water, &amp; ammo, because with coming food shortages there&rsquo;s gonna be riots - and the folks of color will be right in front trying to take what they failed to plan OR pay for.  And don&rsquo;t forget your pets.</p>

		<p>Dear Poster 32, El Cerote,</p>
<p>Friend, I still believe what I wrote, but thanks for your perspective.  My experience has been with blacks in the Atlanta and Birmingham areas.  Yes, blacks hate us, but they want to be around us anyway, not just what we create and our stuff.  They know that living among whites they will be treated better than living among their own.  Among whites they are much less likely to experience the murder, robbery, rape and assault that they are so accustomed to from living among their fellow blacks.  That counts for a lot.  </p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t always act in a way that is consistent with what they tell themselves they &#8220;hate,&#8221; or what they &#8220;love.&#8221;  They do what their survival instinct tells them to do.  Blacks generally hate whites, but choose to live in white neighborhoods when they can.  Whites generally do not hate blacks, but they try to avoid having to live anywhere near them.  It would be great if blacks sought to live in all black areas in the same way that whites seek to live in all white areas.  I could have saved a lot of money not having to practice &#8220;white flight&#8221; to get away from black crime, if they preferred living among their own.</p>
<p>And thanks for the reminder about provisions.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another area where _admitting_ that there is a problem that goes BEYOND RACE as a &#8216;prejudicial psychology&rsquo; would put us on a fast track to fixing the issue rather than bandaiding it.</p>
<p>https://goo.gl/75uAq</p>
<p>Whites have a 16% population fraction of IQs over 115.  Blacks have a 2.5% rating.  Going by Lynn, that IQ deficiency has an R= .73 correlation with expected happiness in career productivity.  Dumb = Trapped, SES wise.</p>
<p>Given that IQ is itself a fraction of mental divided by chronological ages, what I see in black dependency on us and Elite _insistence_ on handcuffing our progress to their&rsquo;s is a result of a childlike wish fulfillment process of &#8220;There goes the gravy train, nobody leave without us!&#8221;.</p>
<p>The brutal reality of which is that, in a society of 36 million blacks, 900,000 cannot possibly sustain the highest level (planning and management) task functioning of their own kind sufficient to form a sub-society.</p>
<p>Whereas, in a society of 150 million whites, 16% translates to around 24,000,000 &#8216;expert enablers&rsquo;.  Who can.  If they are not cheated out of college training by racial quotas for Jews (3% get 27%), Asians (6% get 23%) and Blacks and Hispanics (40% get another 30%).</p>
<p>And because these numbers are so unfairly &#8216;race biased&rsquo; against the least capable or quantitively useful populations, our racial benevolence stands a good chance of crashing the very society which generates it. </p>
<p>We could fix this.  We could do it a hurry if we wanted to, simply because there are so many elements of the genetics involved which are likely single-gene related and thus -easy- to track down.  Myelin thicknesses translates to insulation on an electrical wire, allowing higher for current flow at a given resistance.  Since the brain functions as a neural network wherein statistical weighting biases are accrued to conceptual mosaic inclusion sets, the faster you can refresh the picture the more weighting variables you can add to your attractor patterns. </p>
<p>The bias statistics inherent to the mean of the parents IQ and the mean of their population IQ dictating the rough skew range (inbetween) for their children ALSO suggests that there are a few genetic triggers that have to activate, developmentally.  Since the IQ edge doesn&rsquo;t debilitate immediately, and it is statistically reliable over generations.</p>
<p>These are NOT &#8216;long sequence&rsquo; impossible to track down.</p>
<p>But the first thing you have to do is get past the notion that not wanting to live with people who are bad for you, however good you are for them is _not innately wrong_.</p>
<p>Because only then you can look at the problem from a biological context and say: &#8220;Okay, how do we get the black population up to a point where they are self sustaining within their own gene group?&#8221;</p>
<p>Why do we need to do this?</p>
<p>Because, only by throwing truckloads of money and &#8216;privilege&rsquo; (for that is what AA comes down to) at blacks can we keep the illusion real.  Without special conditions, you are looking at a rapid return, already visible in urban center populations of the deep ghetto, to African Black IQs.</p>
<p>Which are not high 80s but rather high 60s.</p>
<p>i.e.  If you don&rsquo;t fix the problem, now, while there is something like the scientific understanding available and resources necessary to make it a practical effort, you will end up with a condition where you are swamped by high birthrate, high violence, low social cohesion blacks _behaving like they do in Zimbabwe_.</p>
<p>Followed in short order by much better organized but only 5-7 points smarter Mestizos.</p>
<p>Need I also point out that if you fix the blacks, you have a good chance of **improving** the whites with the same discoveries?</p>
<p>How long has it been since we made such an important investment in our children&rsquo;s future?</p>
