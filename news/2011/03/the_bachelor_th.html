			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Braxton, Los Angeles Times, March 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For fans of &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and its spinoff, &#8220;The Bachelorette,&#8221; who have wondered why the veteran ABC dating franchise has never spotlighted a nonwhite contestant in the title role in any of their combined 21 seasons, the shows&rsquo; creator has come up with at least a partial answer: People of color apparently don&rsquo;t want to be on the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always want to cast for ethnic diversity,&#8221; Mike Fleiss said in a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, adding, &#8220;It&rsquo;s just that for whatever reason, they don&rsquo;t come forward. I wish they would.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one of television&rsquo;s top producers had another word for the absence of minorities on &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221;: racism.</p>
<p>&#8220;[T]hey blame minorites [sic] for &#8216;not coming forward&rsquo;. What a joke,&#8221; Shawn Ryan, creator of &#8220;The Shield&#8221; and Fox&rsquo;s &#8220;The Chicago Code,&#8221; wrote on Twitter, discussing Fleiss&rsquo; comments. Ryan, whose dramas have included leading and prominent minority characters, maintained the absence was indicative of &#8220;[s]traight up racism. They just don&rsquo;t think America will watch black bachelor [sic] or root for mixed-race marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Ryan&rsquo;s blasts represent some of the harshest public criticisms yet of what is one of ABC&rsquo;s most high-profile franchises  &mdash;  &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; just completed its 15th edition on Monday. {snip}</p>
<p>And even though ABC executives maintained two years ago that the show was &#8220;exploring&#8221; the possibilities of casting a person of color in the pivotal role, insiders said producers had little interest in pursuing a more diverse cast, and were unwilling to vary the chemistry of a hugely popular series and wary of a potential controversy stemming from an interracial romance.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A further obstacle to more diversity is the show&rsquo;s structure, in which the single &#8220;star&#8221; selects from a pool of romantic interests. A familiar pattern of &#8220;The Bachelor&#8221; and &#8220;The Bachelorette&#8221; is that the few minority singles in the initial group of participants rarely survive beyond the first elimination. {snip}<br>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only seen bits and pieces of these shows. As a man, it&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m interested in. The premise seems to be geared toward [white] womens fantasies of finding Prince Charming and true love.</p>
<p>I do wish they&rsquo;d trying a black cast but I suspect the audience would be limited and the producers know it. They would likely have to pick white-acting blacks and not &#8216;authentic-blacks&rsquo;. Since most blacks wouldn&rsquo;t see themselves in the cast, blacks would likely not watch in large numbers. White women who dream of finding Mr. Wonderful would watch but in smaller numbers.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a numbers game and the numbers aren&rsquo;t there for a sizable audience share.<br>

<p>Well he&rsquo;s right about that! Its a BUSINESS, you market what sells. <br>
They just can&rsquo;t accept the fact that the majority of Whites still want a White partner and don&rsquo;t look upon them as gods-goddesses that save the &#8216;whirl&rsquo;.<br>
 Why is it that blacks want to be included in EVERY facet of the &#8220;White world&#8221; but yet claim we treat them bad! We KNOW blacks hate us, thats why you&rsquo;ll never hear of Whites sueing to get into a black event, club, neighborhood, business etc..<br>
As I&rsquo;ve said before, why can&rsquo;t THEY create THEIR OWN Bachelor-Bachelorette shows. They do have BET don&rsquo;t they. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve watched some seasons for the fun-factor, imagining I was the dashing young millionaire with a bevy of beauties competing for my affection.  If a bachelor/ette were non-white, I would not watch it.  I could not identify with Dequan, Pablo or Chen-ming as they vie for a crowd of blond beauties, which would undoubtedly be the cast.</p>
<p>BET has a black version of this show.  Why do non-whites always want to force us to accept them in our world, but we don&rsquo;t try to push ourselves into their cultural things, myths, etc?</p>
<p>Anyway, on one season of the bachelor, an Oriental woman, Tess, was chosen as the final winner among all the girls.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not a regular watcher of the Bachelor/Bachelorette. I learned early on just to watch the last few episodes to guess who would be chosen. Most years I haven&rsquo;t watched it at all. I am embarassed to say that I did just watch every episode of the season that just ended. (I didn&rsquo;t watch the other season that this Bachelor, Brad, was on years ago. During cold nights, I found things to do while I listened and watched.) It&rsquo;s so silly. </p>
<p>First off, I don&rsquo;t know if there would be a large enough pool of decent, camera-ready black females to pull from the assummedly tough application &amp; screening process. </p>
<p>Secondly, the white girls chasing a white guy talk of their &#8216;journey&rsquo; and a &#8216;fairlytale ending&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t think this would ring home to an all black cast. </p>
<p>Finally, for me, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to watch blacks making out. I think whites get creeped out if there&rsquo;s too much of this in movies. It&rsquo;s not marketable. Their ratings would plummet. </p>

		<p>As much as the blacks and White liberal chosen elites complain about &#8220;embarrassing and hurtful lack of diversity,&#8221; our White AmRen community knows the real game:</p>
<p>1. Diversity means more blacks get jobs, thus justifying the shakedown paychecks of the diversity enforcers- it&rsquo;s an industry that proclaims a moral authority when it has none- it&rsquo;s success is based on thuggery- we&rsquo;ll boycott and ruin you if you don&rsquo;t do what we say and hire more blacks, which means you must hire fewer Whites, thus killing the dreams of those have earned the chance to work and flourish</p>
<p>2. Diversity means more blacks coming into the homes of millions of Whites (who shouldn&rsquo;t be watching TV, so serves them right for the hideous nightmares), and the Cosby Show Effect can work its diversity treatment- Whites who watch the C.Show are less prejudiced than Whites who don&rsquo;t because they think blacks are all middle class Whites with black skin and kinky wool on their heads</p>
<p>3. Diversity means the Whites on TV are never seen in 100% Whites Only situations, always must have blacks mixed in, thus project to White children that approval and status in society, and potential fame, are based on avoiding 100% Whites Only gatherings (you might be a hateful, virulent, dangerous racist if you don&rsquo;t have a black friend at all your events, even Christmas and Easter dinner)</p>
<p>4. Diversity on TV means hiding typical black diversity- TV blacks have been trained how to submerge their blackness when around Whites so they won&rsquo;t be intimidating, and to act White enough to seem friendly- typical black diversity is on your evening news every night in the reports on robbery, rape, and murder</p>
<p>5. And most of all, diversity on TV is intended to dilute White identity- Whites must develop multicultural sensitivity, and they can&rsquo;t do that without the diversity treatment (yeah, we develop our sensitivity- AmRen Style!)- and whenever a &#8220;racist hate crime&#8221; scandal (hoax?) erupts on campus, the blacks blame the racism on too few black in class and in tenured faculty positions- racism is eradicated on campus by surrounding Whites (all are racist, you know) with the diversity treatment, and that&rsquo;s how we eradicate racism by intimidating Whites into never speaking their instinctive wisdom and race realism</p>
<p>In other words, White Humanity must never be allowed to think of itself as a member of a White Community and develop unity around anything, unless it&rsquo;s protracted worshiping of Lying Rosa Parks and Michael King Fake Reverend while &#8220;atoning for the sins of shameful segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privileges&#8221;.</p>
<p>When will the blacks ever thank us for all the free schools, medicines, unearned opportunities, unearned career advancement, Federal Government protection, White philanthropy, Habitat Houses, billions for Africa, etc.?</p>
<p>As Pat Buchanan asks, &#8220;Where&rsquo;s the gratitude?&#8221;  <br>

		<p>They already had a &#8216;black&rsquo; Bachelor. Brigitte Nielson was even on it. It was incredible. Among other light-hearted shenanigans, a black &#8216;ho&rsquo; defecated on the hallway floor. The black Bachelor, one Flava Flav, smelled it immediately and determined the guilty party. He sent the &#8216;ho&rsquo; packing. I thought the black bachelor show was an uplifting success. </p>

<p>OH, Har dee Har Har</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d never admit it publicly, Mr. Fleiss, but you and every other producer of these loser shows couldn&rsquo;t give a **** about &#8220;ethnic diversity&#8221;:  You are only interested in ONE color and that is GREEN, as in Money. If &#8220;ethnic diversity&#8221; sold, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d be pushing, but it doesn&rsquo;t and you know it.</p>
<p>Now, how about telling me how to get BET and UNIVISION off my cable line-up?</p>

As I&rsquo;ve said before, why can&rsquo;t THEY create THEIR OWN Bachelor-Bachelorette shows. They do have BET don&rsquo;t they.</p>
<p>Actually, it is many White leftist groups that have complained about the Bachelor being all White. In fact, when they polled most Balck people, 88% had never even seen or watched the show. It was the same with the wildly popular NBC program Friends</p>
<p>They did a poll in 1999 and while 78% of Blacks were aware of the show, only 16% stated that they watched it and of those 16%, they tuned into the show only sporadically or very seldom. Rather, it was White journalists and commentators like Katie Couric, Ted Casablancas, Bill Maher etc&hellip; who complained about the lack of ethnicity on the show. The number of Blacks who have made such comments about these programs can be counted on two hands. If anything, they tend to be cultural critics who  have a vested interest in stirring up the pot in a effort to keep their insignificant jobs. </p>
<p>Moreover, there was a study just completed last month that showed the top 10 television programs for Blacks and Whites and according to the study, the only program that made the top 10 for both races was Monday Night Football.</p>
<p>My point is that I bet if any of us who are White approached the average Black person on the street about the bachleor, or related programs, they probably would say &#8220;oh I have heard about them, get them confused with some BET program or state that &#8220;I do not watch those programs.    The study validates this point.</p>
<p>My point is that most Blacks in all probability do not go around discussing or yelling their exclusion from these types of programs given the fact that they have little, if any interest in them. </p>
<p>It is the White elite that has a vested interest in this charade.</p>

		<p>It strikes me that they only group of Blacks who would be interested in the Bachelor would be Black females from the ages of 23-30. Even then it would probably include only a small percentage of them.   </p>
<p>I doubt that these women are writing ABC, The New York Times etc.. ranting aboutthis issue. I could be wrong, but its strikes me that there is a larger agenda from the media and certain columnists Black, White, Hispanic, female etc&hellip;</p>

		<p>I think there is more to this than what the usual anti-non white diatribe so pervasive in this sight might seem to suggest. Why would a non-white woman or man want to expose her/him self to the entire viewing public engaging in an intimate pursuit (which after all dating is) where the opposite number is overwhelmingly likely to be white? Surely, it could be a decidedly uncomfortable experience.  As a non white who has dated white, my natural instinct was to keep my relationship rather private and avoid being conspicuously &#8220;in your face&#8221; knowing that many in the majority white community would be hostile towards my relationship.  Wisdom would dictate keeping a low profile&hellip;<br>

		<p>These shows are supposed to be real, though they may be secretly scripted, at least in part.  Non-blacks and black women won&rsquo;t want to see some black stud picking some blonde Nordic beauty  &mdash;  and the producers know it.  The program&rsquo;s creators would have to have black men always picking black women, and the incredibility of such a situation would soon become apparent.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself a racist BUT I would be greatly offended if I were on one of these shows and all of a sudden here is a black male trying to force himself on me.<br>
Most women I know Are Not Interested in dating outside of their race, why does the government and the media keep pushing this?<br>
I can read and I see on the CDC site where blacks stand as far as hiv/aids and all other sexual diseases and it&rsquo;s not good.<br>
I see the news (when they show it) where blacks seem to constantly be up to no good. There are many reasons why I prefer to stay with my own kind. Why do I have to explain WHY to Anyone?<br>
Seventy percent of black children will never even know their father. Why would any woman want to become involved with a male like that?</p>

		<p>Despite what people see in the media miscegenation is not that common.  People are being conditioned to believe it is through all sorts of different programming from TV shows, news and commercials.  I would even take it one step further and say alot of the interracial couples you see in public are being fabricated.  I&rsquo;ve come to this conclusion just through simple observation of their behavior and the odd mismatch of the couples.  I can certainly believe that a poor unattractive White woman growing up in racially mixed neighborhood who wears her hair in cornrows, speaks ebonics and is functionally black would be involved with black men but a beautiful woman of obvious breeding?  No way.  I have also seen a few White men of good genetic stock with black women and I know they can find a better partner and any male in my experience wouldn&rsquo;t give these women the time of day.  Open your eyes and see through the lies.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before here, to worry about being &#8220;racist&#8221; is to lose an argument before it has begun. That &#8220;word&#8221; has no cognitive weight. Quit worrying about it.</p>

I would rather get into a ring with 3 black men for a battle than one black female, they are violent, mean spirited and extremly aggressive. This is just one mans opinion and others will need to make up their own mind.</p>

<p>Any hints on how we might convert our inconsequential feelings of hostility toward you into effective activism against you would be appreciated.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As a non white who has dated white, my natural instinct was to keep my relationship rather private and avoid being conspicuously &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; knowing that many in the majority white community would be hostile towards my relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>What world do you live in? I have never once seen a white person publicly castigate or even publicly make insulting comments about an interracial relationship.</p>
<p>I saw blacks routinely make loud, insulting or degrading comments about blacks dating non-blacks when I was in the military.</p>

I think there is more to this than what the usual anti-non white diatribe so pervasive in this sight might seem to suggest. Why would a non-white woman or man want to expose her/him self to the entire viewing public engaging in an intimate pursuit (which after all dating is) where the opposite number is overwhelmingly likely to be white? Surely, it could be a decidedly uncomfortable experience. As a non white who has dated white, my natural instinct was to keep my relationship rather private and avoid being conspicuously &ldquo;in your face&rdquo; knowing that many in the majority white community would be hostile towards my relationship. Wisdom would dictate keeping a low profile&hellip;</p>

<p>Sure does look like a troll to me also&hellip;</p>
<p>since when did a nonwhite who dates a White ever keep a low profile, as he states he did? Just the opposite.</p>

		<p>From what I`ve noticed the Black contestants always get past the first round because they`re Black, then get dumped in the second round because they`re, well&hellip;. Black!</p>
