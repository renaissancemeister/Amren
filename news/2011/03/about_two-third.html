			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeannine Stein, Los Angeles Times, March 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>If you&rsquo;re older, chances are you&rsquo;re at a higher risk for hearing loss  &mdash;  in a recent study about 63% of adults over 70 had it. But the same study found that being black may have a protective effect. While about 64% of whites in the study showed some hearing loss, only 43% of blacks did.</p>
<p>The study, published online recently in the Journal of Gerontology: Medical Sciences, analyzed data from a two-year cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an ongoing national health research program. Among 717 participants who had hearing tests, about two-thirds had mild to severe hearing loss. Increasing age and being male were both linked with an increased risk for hearing loss.</p>
<p>But black study participants only had about a 43% prevalence of some hearing loss. According to the study, while some believe that melanin (a skin pigment) in the stria vascularis, an area in the ear that contains melanin, may be protective, some animal studies have not always shown that to be true.</p>

		<p>They would be at less risk of hearing loss if they didn&rsquo;t stick earbuds in and then turn up their rap music to a volume such that it&rsquo;s clearly audible to passersby.</p>

		<p>Wait until the young black generation gets old and I bet they&rsquo;ll start to show much higher hearing loss numbers. It&rsquo;ll be because of the loud rap music they immersed themselves in while inside their cars. You can hear it coming a block away even if the windows are rolled up. And to make matters worse, when that happens they&rsquo;ll turn it up even louder if they can&rsquo;t hear it very well.</p>

		<p>White Male hearing loss.</p>
<p>I am an old white male with hearing loss.</p>
<p>A land mine went off near me, and blew out my left ear. I was lucky to be alive.</p>
<p>My point is that old white males were more likely to work in steel mills, participate in wars on the front lines, and other loud environments. Was this taken into account in their stupid &#8220;study&#8221;?</p>
<p>Just my thoughts,<br>

<p>Blacks work (???) in government offices that have to have an environment below a certain decibel level, or they get to go home and still get paid. Whites have to work in factories with loud machinery. Even with ear plugs and ear muffs, you can still lose your hearing. </p>
<p>On another note. If blacks have better hearing, then it is because they are superior to whites. If blacks have worse hearing than whites, then it is because of white racism which denies blacks proper hearing protection or affordable medical care.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve used chainsaws regularly for 35 years, usually, though not always, with hearing protection. My hearing is still pretty good. I&rsquo;ve also done high-altitude mountaineering and x-country skiing, usually, though not always, with eye protection. My visual impairment seems to be greater than my hearing impairment, though I can read very well with OTC reading glasses. Eyes and ears both need protection from high levels of UV or dB.</p>

		<p>I find this very interesting(I think you guys are reading too much into this&hellip;it isn&rsquo;t an attack on &#8220;whites,&#8221; it is merely pointing out biological differences).</p>
<p>Skin color isn&rsquo;t superficial!</p>
<p>I would be interested in knowing what these other animals are.</p>
<p>Thanks Anrem for giving me more in my arsenal!</p>

		<p>So when can I expect the gov&rsquo;t to start handing me money, and give me preferential treatment at job hiring, university recruitment, etc for having white ears?</p>

		<p>Ben,</p>
<p>Race is not the same as skin color; Asian-Indians often have skin darker than blacks but we are genetically far more similar to whites. I&rsquo;m sick and tired of both white liberals and racialists claiming that race and color are the same thing. Asian Indians would be eaten alive in a black neighborhood despite our dark skin.</p>
