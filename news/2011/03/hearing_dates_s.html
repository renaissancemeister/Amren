<h1>Hearing Dates Set in Motions for New Trials in Torture Slayings</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel, March 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} The backdrop was a hearing in one of those that drew watchers from across the nation and beyond  &mdash;  the January 2007 torture slayings of Channon Christian, 21, and Christopher Newsom, 23. The issue was what happens now that [Judge Richard] Baumgartner [who presided over the Knoxville Horror trials] has confessed to buying and ingesting hundreds of opiate-based painkillers from a felon under probation in his court.</p>
<p>The key question? What impact, if any, will his nearly yearlong illegal drug use have on the cases he handled? If defense attorneys raise concerns about the validity of their clients&rsquo; convictions and sentencings, it will be up to state appellate courts to ferret that out in the lion&rsquo;s share of cases Baumgartner handled from November 2009 to September 2010, the period during which he was procuring pills from a street dealer.</p>
<p>But there remains a handful of cases that are caught in limbo between convictions at trial and required hearings that test the legal validity of those trials before appeals can be launched, and those decisions had remained in Baumgartner&rsquo;s hands. Among those cases are pending motions for new trials for the four suspects convicted in the slayings of Christian and Newsom.</p>
<p>Leibowitz sought Friday to reassure not only the public but the families of Christian and Newsom that the wheels of justice, temporarily derailed by Baumgartner&rsquo;s guilty plea earlier this month, are back on the tracks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In order to decide whether convicts Letalvis Cobbins, Lemaricus Davidson, George Thomas and Vanessa Coleman received constitutionally sound trials under Baumgartner, Blackwood will have to review thousands of pages of transcripts for not only all four trials, but also a dozen or so motions hearings in the run-ups to those trials, which spanned from August 2009 to May 2010.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s already hard at work, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last several weeks, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to read most of (the Cobbins&rsquo; trial) transcript,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Blackwood [Special Judge Jon Kerry Blackwood, who has been handling Baumgartner&rsquo;s docket] made it clear that he would broker no further delay in deciding whether new trials should be granted, setting firm hearing dates and warning defense attorneys that if they intend to use Baumgartner&rsquo;s legal woes to attack the validity of their clients&rsquo; convictions, they should not tarry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He set the following hearing dates in the motions for new trials: Cobbins, June 9; Davidson, Sept. 8; Thomas, Oct. 6; and Coleman, Dec. 1.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So far, none of the four defendants in the fatal carjacking has mentioned Baumgartner&rsquo;s legal woes in court filings, and Leibowitz noted that the former judge&rsquo;s guilty plea to official misconduct does not automatically call into question the soundness of his legal rulings.</p>
<p>The families of Christian and Newsom said after Friday&rsquo;s hearing that they are relieved the cases can now move forward.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davidson is on death row. Cobbins and Thomas are serving life terms with no possibility of parole. Coleman, the only one of the four to be convicted of lesser charges of facilitating murder, is serving a 53-year prison term.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>The &#8220;Justice&#8221; system and those wastes of  protoplasm, the &#8220;defendants&#8221; in this horror, are working in tandem to make sure the Christian and Newsom families will NEVER see the end of this, NEVER see real justice for long. By the time all the motions for retrials, the retrials themselves and the appeals are finished, they will be lucky if the judge doesn&rsquo;t just sentence the murderous thugs to &#8220;time served&#8221;.</p>

		<p>The Christian and Newsom families have suffered far more than anyone should ever have to endure. I just can not imagine a day going by for them where they do not feel a pain that most would never wish upon their worst enemy. </p>
<p>While retrials or at least re-examining them would put these families back in court, having to hear of these most horrific crimes again, I for one hope that the trials and coverage of them are reopened. Every time a white hears of this for the first time will only serve to wake white consciousness. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m with 7 Dying Breed on this.  Emmett Till&rsquo;s death over 50 years ago is better known than this case.  The MSM wallows over the miniscule number of Blacks killed by Whites and ignores the White victims of Blacks.  Let&rsquo;s see if the re-opening this case can be used to re-open some White minds.  </p>

		<p>There may never be equal Justice served for the horrific deaths of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom, unfortunately the Justice system does not equate to true Justice anymore. It seems that quite a few people has forgotten that true Justice includes that when you maliciously kill someone/people you have just forfeited your life as well. It is up to those that still believe in true Justice to keep striving for better standards. All that I can say (as I shake my head in disgust) they sure better be glad I am not the Judge proceeding over their cases. And as for the Judge that bought,&#8221;opiate-based painkillers from a felon under probation in his court&#8221; shame on you Judge, may you always live in shame for the pain you have caused to these families as well.      </p>

<p>&#8220;BLACK ON WHITE LYNCHINGS IN AMERICA: A NEVERENDING HOLOCAUST&#8221;</p>
<p>a virtual, online museum featuring civil rights violations committed by blacks against whites.</p>
<p>the museum site, which should be well illustrated, should include the names of every American white who has been murdered by a black over the past century, with new cases added daily, and a second section listing all of the whites who have been injured, raped, or otherwise assaulted by blacks.</p>

<p>In the two trials I watched, Davidson&rsquo;s and Cobbins&rsquo;, the jury determined the sentences.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a fact I&rsquo;ll never forget, because in the sentencing phase of the trials, the families of the PERPS got to get up on the stand and literally blubber about the bad childhoods their darlings had, and about how one perp&rsquo;s young nephew would suffer from not having an older male relative in his life if the perp were executed.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s part of the examination of &#8220;mitigating circumstances&#8221; that has come about because of Supreme Court rulings on the 8th Ammendment&hellip;I researched the matter and understood it at one point, but have forgotten its substance now&hellip;all I retain is a strong feeling of disgust at its corruption of the legal process.</p>

		<p>Anyone here a lawyer?  I&rsquo;m thinking that if you work the normal &#8216;chinks in the case law&rsquo; route, you cannot be subject to a harsher sentence, that there is likely a negotiative process involved whereby certain elements (applicable to certain felony counts) are tossed out, leaving the rest of the case robust on a lowered sentence.</p>
<p>But if the entire trial is deemed to be unlawfully/inappropriately administered, does this not suggest that a -harsher- sentence could be handed down under retrial?</p>
<p>And how about double jeopardy?  Don&rsquo;t you waive your protections and allow the prosecution to include new offenses and better/more completely argumented evidence for existing indictments?</p>

That these God forsaken Humanoids may get the right to another trial makes me sick. If they do, maybe just maybe  European Americans will WAKE UP! The truth behind these race hate crimes hopefully will come out! I will mourn again for the family if they have to go through this horror again.  The only silver lining would be is is the retrial results in the death penalty for all the humanoids.Thanks for letting me vent! To steal a line<br>

		<p>Was the entire jury on drugs as well?  If not then only the severity of their sentencing is in question - of which I believe rape and murder, for most Americans, would be death.</p>
<p>Some people only see the dark clouds, I see the silver lining - perhaps he didn&rsquo;t sentence them to death BECAUSE he was high?  Why does the judge being high have to be a bad thing?  They were convicted by jury.</p>

		<p>I just submitted a comment on the Knoxville paper that carried the story. <br>
I mentioned that with a new trial, the death penalty would likely be set aside for a life sentence in which case the &#8220;sub-humans&#8221; would spend their time working out, getting first class health and dental care and sodomizing young inmates who are in for much less serious offenses and enjoy the hero status among their peers for having eliminated two young Caucasians. </p>

		<p>22 Jedermann: No, they don&rsquo;t have very many actual White on Black crimes to talk about.  That&rsquo;s why there were &#8220;news&#8221; articles about the 10th anniversary of the killing of James Byrd, a Black felon killed by two White felons in a dispute over ill-gotten gain.  That&rsquo;s why a noose made of string found on a college campus was a big deal, while an old White man kicked to death by two young Black men the same week never got out of the &#8220;Local News&#8221; section.  White deaths don&rsquo;t count for nearly as much as Black rage.  </p>

		<p>I KNEW when this case first leaked out (months after it should have) that the vile gang that did this would not be executed for many, many years, and that some would escape from their just punishment. And that ain&rsquo;t good. </p>
<p>Consider Sharia. I had a friend who went to the execution grounds outside of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and observed the punishment of a rapist. This was just a few weeks after the crime. The rapist was tied to a pole, and the father of the victim was handed a rifle. He took careful aim, and hit the rapist in the left arm. He slowly reloaded, took careful aim, and hit the right arm. After more careful aiming, he hit the left leg, and then, for the fourth shot, the right leg. By this time, the rapist had finished screaming and fainted. The Saudi army officer presiding over the event took charge and walked over to the slumped body with a pistol and shot him in the temple. </p>
<p>Think about it: just a few weeks after the crime, the victims were able to go home feeling that justice had been done, and closure could begin. But in our country? When will the parents of Channon and Christopher find closure?<br>
