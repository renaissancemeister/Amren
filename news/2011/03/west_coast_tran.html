<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>People from the West Coast are seeking more affordable living in the mountain states, helping to propel nine counties in the southern half of Idaho to grow more than 25% in the past decade.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of the new residents migrated from California, Washington and Oregon, Dale said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Several counties in the state&rsquo;s southeast quadrant grew by more than a quarter. Madison and Jefferson Counties both grew 37%.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Idaho became slightly more diverse in the past decade. The population in 2000 was 88% non-Hispanic white; now it is 84%. The non-Hispanic black population, less than 1% of the state, went from 0.4% to 0.6%: 8,875 people. </p>
<p>Hispanics, who can be of any race, account for 11% of the population, up from 8% in 2000.</p>
<p>&#8220;People don&rsquo;t think about Idaho having any diversity at all,&#8221; said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. &#8220;Hispanics account for a lot of the growth in the state.&#8221;<br/>

		<p>These west coasters are liberal to the core, and they will never learn their lesson. They ruin their place, and when they move, they will move to a mostly white area, complain about the lack of diversity, and move again once it gets there.</p>

<p><br/>
They need not change their minds. Unless it is stopped, &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (read: Mexico&rsquo;s underclasses) will flood the state and the Whites will leave. The great irony will be their clamoring to take back &#8220;their&#8221; country, each time grabbing what Whites have created.</p>

<p>Jared Taylor wrote in the article about Japan:<br/>
&#8220;Only a few populations are capable of building such societies, and they are vastly superior to all others. That, of course, is why so many people from failed societies want to immigrate, but when they come in sufficient numbers they destroy what they came to find.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we can see that even within a country their is a migration from colored areas to white areas and if you go to Germany you can see a migration within the cities where colored people try to get into the white hoods fleeing from what they have created their own.<br/>
But I am pretty sure this is all because of slavery.</p>

		<p>This is all part of the plan.</p>
<p>Once they plop down their anchor babies in Los Angeles and they grow up, they migrate legally.</p>
<p>Once there are too many Mexicans in Southern California they spread out.  It will happen in every state of the Union until they are in ALL states, majority.  Even if we end birthright citizenship today, it may be too late to stop them without another civil war.  Like blacks, they hate us to their core, but cannot stand life if they are not our neighbors.</p>

		<p>Lovely. The propagandist from the Brookings Insttute wants to make sure that readers are aware that the Hispanics with 11% of the population account for &#8220;a lot of the growth&#8221; but no credit goes to the 89% white population. </p>

		<p>Dang, I was thinking of retiring in Idaho.  Where there is one mexican, there&rsquo;s 50 more unaccounted for.  In 30 years when I am able to retire, Idaho should be about 70% hispanic and crime will increase 5000% from current figures. </p>

		<p>D B Cooper is right on the mark. These left-wing loads leave states where they&rsquo;ve voted for their Marxist garbage, and proceed to contaminate the states of their migration. Look at Arizona, Nevada, and for cryin&rsquo; out loud, what they&rsquo;ve done to Boise! I fervently hope they get frostbite in their nether-regions! Left-wing garbage destroy every community they inhabit&hellip;a larger scourge than blacks and illegals..wellll..maybe.</p>

		<p>I saw a U.S. map once showing Hispanic areas in red, the more Hispanics, the redder it was.  Southern Idaho was surpisingly red.  There&rsquo;s nowhere to flee to anymore, or soon won&rsquo;t be.</p>

America is like a mouse maze to the elite.<br/>
Once the politicians engorge a state with massive numbers of non-whites, the companies then take over and make life so unbearable that non-whites flee the state and relocate to live in and corrupt a new area in a new state.<br/>

<p>&gt; Not true.  When I moved to Washington State, the first Realtor I dealt with was spouting Christian babble all the time. He was a home grown, native born son who&rsquo;s father had worked in lumber mills here.  One thing he commented on was how the church he went to was all white and how bad they all felt that no &#8220;people of color&#8221; were to be seen in the congregation.</p>
<p>&gt; I have a cousin who has long lived in Idaho, but is from Northern California, via Michigan (and a conservative family).  My cousin is a conservative, Republican and selfish to the core.  All he cares about when he isn&rsquo;t working is hunting and fishing.  So his daughter gets a sports scholarship to New York and comes back home pregnant with some black jerk&rsquo;s baby.  He is raising it now. We have fallen out over the &#8220;new&#8221; black member of the family, which they gave our surname to, and I&rsquo;ve had to listen to every usually liberal argument from him as to why it is okay.  </p>
<p>Remember you smug ones out there, TV and the internet gets everywhere.  California used to be a very conservative state outside of Hollywood and SF.  After all, Reagan was once governor and some of you might remember him. I never liked him with his professional glad-handing of his bumpkin supporters, while he allowed the Saving and Loans to rob everyone of their retirement, and gave amnesty to illegals, as well as set up Afghanistan for us to deal with later.  People who camp in the liberal and conservative polarities are equally idiotic, only with different methods, both aimed at robbing the people.</p>

		<p>I am amazed at the comments.  There are more Hispanics in southern Idaho because there are more farms. Farmers like cheap labor.  All the farmers in the midwest and Northwest are doing what California did and are going to become more Hispanic overall as a result.</p>
<p>California got filled up with them because of the HUGE agricultural activity in the state.  Once Hispanics got political, and they did it with both Dems and Reps as governors by never shuting up, even going to the capitol in Sacramento and sitting in the Assembly pews, yelling.  We voted to NOT pay for school and health costs of illegals and got it overturned by La Raza and Mecha in a lawsuit.  In California, we fought, but you people in the Northwest and Mountain states, Midwest, including Colorado, just let them in without a political fight at all.</p>

<p><br/>
You&rsquo;re wrong!  Since I moved up to the North, I have heard more white Christians talking about Diversity and inclusion than I ever did in California.  Lots of white boys with their caps on backwards, listening to rap, etc.</p>
<p>I think that people like you hate the notion of liberals more than Hispanic takeover, hate the coastal states out of jealousy, etc.  But California was full of white people from the Midwest when I was growing up, including me.  </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to stop going after other white people.  We&rsquo;ve got to think more about educating every white about race realism and the dangers of the future, rather than condemning everyone from one region or another.  This isn&rsquo;t helpful at all.</p>
