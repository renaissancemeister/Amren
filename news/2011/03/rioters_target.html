<h1>Rioters Target Seattle Police, Local Businesses Late Saturday</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carol M. Ostrom, Seattle Times, February 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of 25 to 30 people, most dressed in black and wearing bandannas or masks, wreaked mayhem Saturday night in Seattle on Capitol Hill and the Denny Triangle, painting anti-police slogans, throwing flares at patrol cars and trashing several businesses, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The melee began about 9 p.m., as an officer was taking a prisoner to the West Precinct office at Eighth Avenue and Virginia Street. The officer noted a large group gathered nearby at Boren Avenue and Howell Street, the intersection where Seattle police Officer Ian Birk fatally shot John T. Williams, a First Nations woodcarver, on Aug. 30. {snip}</p>
<p>As the officer drove by the group, someone discharged a fire extinguisher at the police car, police said.</p>
<p>Members of the group put up plastic fencing and caution tape in the intersection, painted an anti-police profanity on the street and on a nearby building and placed a couple dozen large staples in the street, possibly intended to flatten tires, police said.</p>
<p>As police approached, the group moved away, gathering later at East Pine Street and East Boylston Avenue. Some carried signs encouraging violence against police and someone threw a large firework at a police car that bounced off and detonated, police said.</p>
<p>As the group moved to Broadway then north, individuals pushed trash cans and paper boxes into the street, police said.</p>

		<p>Look for more of this in the near future from all the &#8216;oppressed&rsquo; minorities.  </p>
<p>Much has been said about how amerika is more segregated than ever - because whites are packing themselves into denser and more rural locations to escape the joys of diversity.</p>
<p>The growing boldness of the underclass and its penchant for violence will accelerate this.  Trouble will really break out when whites realize the game is up and object to more forced diversity.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Put up plastic fencing and caution tape&#8221;<br>
Reminds me of the time I was treating a jogging trail as my own personal Panzer motorcycle breakout lane&hellip; A man in shorts came up on me and straddled the front wheel with his legs and put his hands on the handle bars. Yeah, I was wrong but it WAS a big jogging trail and he and I were the only ones on it. But when he impeded my movement and ability to get away from him, I just let it into low and rolled right over him. Sorry mister, but you turned it from  a lecture into a frightening detaining of my person. And I couldn`t count on what a stranger might have in mind. A car is your best safety and escape plan. Dont let caution tape and people jumping in front of you make you  give up your best chance at escape!! </p>

		<p>Western Washington State has people always ready to &#8220;hit the streets&#8221; in protest.  The shooting by the police officer appears to be a gross over reaction as he only gave the &#8220;Native American (PC)&#8221; woodcarver about 4 or 5 seconds to drop his knife, I&rsquo;ve seen the video, but the city of Seattle has bent over backwards saying their sorry and the police officer has resigned.  It&rsquo;s the &#8220;Pros&#8221; that have taken this over and they could care less about the woodcarver or the incident as Seattle is full of these people that only want to riot &amp; cause physical injury. I&rsquo;m sure a large cash settlement will come out of this and it won&rsquo;t be due to rioters.     </p>

		<p>I agree whole heartedly with respondent #2. As a teen in the 1960&rsquo;s I was driving down a street when a multitude of blacks ran onto the road and linked arms a short distance in front of me. Bad mistake!!! I became so furious I floored the gas pedal of the vehicle and they scattered in all directions. Don&rsquo;t ever stop around minorities as they count on whites being law abiding and will harm or kill you if they get you alone. </p>

		<p>Just curious - but where does the original article or other media ever mention anything about &#8220;Indians&#8221; running amok ? Also, when you meant Indians, did that denote native Americans or the Asians from the subcontinent ? My point is simply to maitain good editorial standards and needlessly avoid dragging any community or ethnicity in a story. </p>

		<p>  American Indians would be extremely foolish to stir up trouble for white people.  Although I am only 1/32 Cherokee I consider myself white and am disgusted with these antics! Do these fools think that when whites become a discernable minority the gravy train will keep on rolling along? No! Third World invaders couldn&rsquo;t care less about U.S. Amerindians. It never ceases to amaze me at how bitter these people can be.  Perhaps if they hadn&rsquo;t been hunter and gathers and had not fought amongst each other they could have slowed or in some fashion contained the European juggernaut temproarily.  They lost and should realize how darn lucky that their conquerers were as humane as they were. </p>

		<p>No way these were Indians, American or sub-continental. They were typical loser white anarchist/antifascist dweebs in &#8216;black bloc&rsquo; outfits, playing revolution. These tards come out for any occasion. They&rsquo;re so deranged, the brother of the Indian who was killed got in their faces. So, not minorities, just self-hating whites of the most extreme type.</p>

		<p>No race riots here. These rioters were the same types   &mdash;   young, apparently mostly white, anarchists   &mdash;   who caused trouble at Seattle&rsquo;s WTO congress. In other words, spoiled punks looking for an excuse to cause trouble.</p>
<p>There is broad agreement here that the police officer who shot Mr. Williams was in the wrong. However, Native people (American Indians &amp; Canadian First Nations) aren&rsquo;t known to start race riots. I&rsquo;m no doubt one of many Seattle residents who assumed the victim was a belligerent black felon when the case first broke, and then breathed a sigh of relief to find out it was instead a harmless (if alcoholic) Native woodcarver. Sad story, but at least we don&rsquo;t have an angry black mob rampaging through the streets.</p>

		<p><i>Seattle police Officer Ian Birk fatally shot John T. Williams, a First Nations woodcarver, on Aug. 30</i></p>
<p>The original article states that the shooting was ruled &#8220;unjustified&#8221; but prosecutors did not file charges.  No more detail than that.</p>
<p>Skip:  First Nations means American Indians or Native Americans and is a term used widely in Canada.  I have a feeling we&rsquo;re going to see a lot more use of this term and more rioting and mayhem as well as  AIs step up their grievance/extortion/demand industry when the massive welfare they&rsquo;ve been receiving for generations dries up.</p>
<p>As for us, who are also Native Born Americans, more White bashing, erasing and re-writing of White history:</p>
<p><i>Caucasian mummies were pulled from an exhibition following a sudden call from the Chinese authorities on the eve of opening&hellip;It raises the question about who first settled in Xinjiang</i> </p>
<p>And:</p>
<p><i>Solutreans are also believed to have discovered America prior to the Indians, an historic conclusion so politically incorrect that the Discovery Channel was recently pressured into taking the DVD version of its film Ice Age Columbus: Who Were The First Americans? off the direct sales market.</i></p>
<p>Unbelievable that any history or archeology that favors Whites is being suppressed by PC censorship, disallowing the flow of science and ideas, cutting off all debate. Anyone who disagrees with the party line will be arrested and thrown in jail as they are in Europe.</p>
<p>Were there any peeps of complaint from the scientific community?  Or has it too gone PC mad?  Erasing our history allows our mortal enemies to dehumanize us by assigning us a &#8220;new&#8221; narrative.  This is already appearing in school text books where we are portrayed as nothing more than bloodthirsty, genocidal colonists. </p>
<p>The old Soviet Bosses would be proud.</p>
<p>The definition of Genocide is as follows:</p>
<p><i>Genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group.</i></p>
<p>This is what is happening to our people, it IS Genocide folks.</p>

<p>You bring up a good point, or perhaps a number of them.  Amerinds ought to realize that the real history of the spread of civilization to North America, although difficult, was inevitable.  It allows them control of huge tracts of land and gambling casinos today, while the old white land barons are long gone.  Now that counter civilization is invading North America, the Amerind must realize that all the painstakingly won rights and privileges they have accumulated over time will be ignored when the growing numbers of Asians and other immigrants, even Hispanics, come into power here.  Ironically, Amerinds are genetically related to Mongolians.  When the Mongolians invaded Europe, they were far more harsh than the Europeans were in North America.  All those diseases that Amerinds love to complain about coming from the White Man, were brought to Europe by Mongolians and their Hunnic relatives during their wars of conquest against Europe.  Some enlightenment might cause Amerinds to see the &#8220;full circle&#8221; effect of global/racial history.  </p>
<p>The White Man has more in common with the Amerind also, now that our decades and decades of development of our Dept. of Fish and Game, BLM, National Forest Service, with a wonderful system of wilderness preservation zones (mostly in the West), are being dismantled through overwhelming abuses by immigrants who are worse than the worst 19th century exploiter, buffalo hunter mentality.  Our various government agencies haven&rsquo;t a chance against such overwhelming numbers of violators and costly enforcement.  We whites who have lived for generations on the land, share the love of that land with the Amerind.  Now, we are learning that sense of an embattled native people that the Amerinds felt in the earlier centuries.  We have seen Grey Eagle and heard him.  I wonder how many Amerinds are listening to him?</p>

<p>This is it.  Seattle is full of these idiot whites.  I attended a King County Bar Association training seminar a few years ago. I took note that the Bar Assn. was run by very leftist, feminists, who while displaying kindness and good deportment in general, had a far left &#8220;matter of fact&#8221; directive in all their works. In Seattle, the leftist agenda is that well entrenched in the white population.</p>
