			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Walter E. Williams, Townhall, March 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>One of the requirements to become a Dayton, Ohio police officer is to successfully pass the city&rsquo;s two-part written examination. Applicants must correctly answer 57 of 86 questions on the first part (66 percent) and 73 of 102 (72 percent) on the second part. Dayton&rsquo;s Civil Service Board reported that 490 candidates passed the November 2010 written test, 57 of whom were black. About 231 of the roughly 1,100 test takers were black.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Eric Holder, rejected the results of Dayton&rsquo;s Civil Service examination because not enough blacks passed. The DOJ has ordered the city to lower the passing score. The lowered passing grade requires candidates to answer 50 of 86 (58 percent) questions correctly on the first part and 64 of 102 (63 percent) of questions on the second. The DOJ-approved scoring policy requires potential police officers to earn the equivalent of an &#8220;F&#8221; on the first part and a &#8220;D&#8221; on the second. Based on the DOJ-imposed passing scores, a total of 748 people, 258 more than before, were reported passing the exam. Unreported was just how many of the 258 are black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is truly insulting to suggest that black people cannot meet the same standards as white people and somehow justice requires lower standards. Black performance on Dayton&rsquo;s Civil Service exam is really a message about fraudulent high school diplomas that many black students receive.</p>
<p>The National Assessment of Educational Progress, sometimes called the Nation&rsquo;s Report Card, tests students at the fourth and eighth grades in math, reading, science and writing. The 2009 eighth-grade scores in Ohio were: In math, 54 percent of whites and 14 percent of blacks tested proficient; 54 percent of whites were proficient in reading while 13 percent of blacks were; in science, 43 percent of white and 6 percent of blacks tested proficient; and in writing, 38 percent of whites tested proficient compared with 13 percent for blacks. This black/white education gap remains through high school completion, as seen by huge score differences in college entrance exams taken during the senior year.</p>
<p>There are a number of explanations for poor academic performance among black students, and they include students and parents who are indifferent, alien and hostile to the education process. There&rsquo;s often a poor education environment where thugs are permitted to make education all but impossible. There are often poorly performing teachers and administrators. These problems are masked by fraudulent grades followed by fraudulent diplomas. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The most tragic consequence of the DOJ actions is that it brings into question legitimate black achievement and possibly sours race relations. Some Dayton white police officers might see their fellow black police officers as affirmative action hires and have less respect and possibly bear a grudge for assumed differences in treatment.</p>

<p>How is this any different from any black in any job or college in America?</p>

<p>Exactly!  Stop passing them in high school if they can&rsquo;t read.  People, please locate the HBO documentary about Frederick Douglass High (2007?) in Baltimore, MD.  It is SHOCKING.</p>
<p>There is a part where the principal talks to a 17 year old 9th grade student that admits she can&rsquo;t read.  The principal tells the girl if she attends every class for the rest of the semester that she will be moved up to 11th grade next semester, no matter her test scores.  Moved up two grades in three months and still illiterate.  I can&rsquo;t make this stuff up folks.</p>

<p>Exactley!  I had an affirmative action supervisor placed over me.  He could not speak properly nor write worth a second grade flunkie.  Any words over two syllables used to make his tongue trip up.  He used to say some really stupid things - anytime he spoke.  He also made horrible decisions and missteps.  </p>
<p>All of us, even the liberals, had to pretend that he was qualified.  He was fired within two years after mucking up the entire department.</p>

		<p>Walter Williams has more good sense than any white liberal.  Ron Paul mentioned Walter Williams as one of the people he&rsquo;d like to see in his cabinet, and I see this as another good reason to like Ron Paul.<br>

		<p>Williams and his ilk are useless to our cause - regerdless of what too many on the right seem to think. He continues to hold forth that there are all kinds of reasons for Black failure&hellip;except genetics! Yes, the problem, they insist, is &#8220;liberals,&#8221; not evolutionary science. This is the standard &#8220;conservative&#8221; partyline of our time with regard to race - and it is all baloney. All White Nationalists, Race-Realists, etc., should understand this by now. &#8220;Conservatives&#8221; are dreamers and fools. </p>

		<p>The main problem is the Great Apologist, Eric Holder, rejecting the results of the exam because it was too difficult. What a joke! Finally- someone with objections to the way liberals treat blacks like their babies and coddle them. Bill Cosby will always be my favorite black guy. Stop making excuses for your crimal delinquent behavior, read some books, go to class and learn to do something positive in life. Wow! That&rsquo;s treasonous to say that out loud.</p>

<p>Besides the measurable genetic difference in intelligence, there are many social factors that hold Blacks back, and most are generated by misguided benevolence on the part of Whites, such as (now in it&rsquo;s 6th generation) welfare, which has annihilated the Black family so completely that there is now a lower percentage of traditional families than during the days of slavery. </p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t let Walter kid you. Blacks are not insulted. They know they&rsquo;re not as competant. Blacks say that&rsquo;s whites&rsquo; fault, and why shouldn&rsquo;t they? Whites with the most money and power tell them that. If powerful whites on the whole said something else, so would blacks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like blacks read Walter. &#8220;Conservative&#8221; whites read Walter, and he knows what they want to hear too.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to become leery of blacks who call themselves conservatives.  They say what whites want to hear, they know whites are too afraid to say what they will, and they make money off that.  Who&rsquo;s to say they don&rsquo;t give private donations to these black interest groups?  And blacks being offended by lowering the standards so it&rsquo;s easier for them to get good paying jobs with benefits where they can&rsquo;t get fired?  Please.  Blacks have benefited off of big government.  </p>

		<p>I used to be in the military and I came across some papers one day solely by accident and it was a letter of reprimand from a military officer to a civil service employee who was working for him.  I deduced the civil servant was black by her name and that the report mentioned her telling him &#8220;why he was tripping&#8221;.  It said the woman in question was being verbally abusive to her co-workers and this officer told her to calm down or she&rsquo;d get written up.  The officer said she walked away from him and mumbled something under her breath to the effect that he should be written up.  He warns her not to walk away and she comes back and starts verbally abusing him.  Seeing the disruption she&rsquo;s causing in the workplace he retreats to the safety of his office until she cools down.  If this person had been White they would have been fired and escorted off the base.  If the NAACP is so powerful that a black can be that disrespectful to their boss without fear of any consequences other than some meaningless letter of reprimand then we&rsquo;re in big trouble.</p>
