<h1>The DiversityInc Top 10 Companies for Blacks</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barbara Frankel, Diversity, Inc., March 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>What makes a company the place where all talent, but in this case especially Black talent, wants to work, stay and fulfill potential, including the ability to innovate? What type of corporate culture is open and inclusive? In general, our data shows that companies that are good for Blacks also are good for women, Latinos, Asians, American Indians, LGBT people, people with disabilities and straight, white men. Those are the companies you&rsquo;ll see on The DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for DiversityÂ® list and many of our other lists.</p>
<p>The companies on this particular list show consistent progress in their recruitment, retention and promotion of Black employees, have active Black employee-resource groups, have higher-than-average procurement spend with minority-owned suppliers, and have strong cross-cultural mentoring programs.</p>
<p>Here are some facts about The DiversityInc Top 10 Companies for Blacks: </p>
<p>* Their workforces are almost 20 percent Black, compared with 10.8 percent for the U.S. adult population (Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p>
<p>* Their managers are 17 percent Black, compared with 8.4 percent of the U.S. population (Bureau of Labor Statistics)</p>
<p>* Thirty-two percent of their promotions into their first management jobs were to Blacks, almost double the average of the DiversityInc Top 50</p>
<p>* Their senior levels (CEO and direct reports and two levels down) all have more than 10 percent Blacks</p>
<p>* Thirty-three percent of their employees on average are members of their Black employee-resource groups (employees do not have to be Black to be members)</p>
<p>* They average 68 percent of their philanthropy going to multicultural groups, compared with 35.1 percent for the DiversityInc Top 50</p>
<p>* They spend 6 percent of their Tier I (direct contractor) procurement with minority-owned businesses, higher than the DiversityInc Top 50 and more than national averages (estimated at 2 percent)</p>

		<p>Top 10&hellip;But What I&rsquo;d like to know is what are the top ten most popular places of employment for blacks.</p>
<p>Funny they don&rsquo;t mention places (except mcdonalds but I don&rsquo;t believe the percentage statistics, and I may not be the only one on here&hellip;) like Wal-mart, Wendy&rsquo;s, dry cleaning services, rim and wheel sales specialists, stereo installers&hellip;i&rsquo;ve seen more blacks work at those companies than the so-called Top 10 list of that article. </p>
<p>Oh yeah!&hellip;who do you think runs a place called DIVERSITY INC?</p>

		<p>Again, when &#8216;diversity&rsquo; works in the favor of people of color, that is, when there&rsquo;s a shortage of whites among the population, whether it is at a school, workplace, neighorhood, or city or state, or indeed an entire country, this reality is something they celebrate. That&rsquo;s always the way it&rsquo;s worked. </p>

		<p>The reason Sodexho ranks so high is because it handles food service and other services for many public school districts, especially in and around big cities.  Therefore, their rank is so high because they have so many blacks working for them.</p>
<p>I find it ironic that Altria is #9, because it is the former Philip Morris, which of course makes cigarettes, which anti-smoking nanny staters are always complaining are marketed at blacks more.<br>

		<p>Having read several issues of that magazine a few years ago, I found it to be an abomination.  It promotes the idea that a company isn;t really bona fide if its work force composition isn&rsquo;t as or more nonwhite than the rest of the country.    </p>
<p>Remember, for a firm to really pass the diversity test with flying colors with this rotten magazine, its contractors and supply chain have to be heavily nonwhite as well.  &#8220;Diverse&#8221; companies don&rsquo;t just put whites out to pasture; they are the cause of other companies putting whites out there as well.  When Wal-Mart a few years ago vowed to improve &#8220;diversity&#8221; among its suppliers, it was a disaster for whites everywhere.  </p>

		<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s notable that no high-tech firm is in the top 10. AT&T; employs a lot of telephone linemen and other blue-collar workers. This is notable because high-tech firms make a good show of trying to appear &#8220;diverse.&#8221; If you counted the number of black faces in their promotional materials, for example, I bet you would see a much higher percentage of blacks than in the population as a whole, much less actually employed by these firms. Liberals will of course point to this as &#8220;disguised racism.&#8221;</p>

We should thank Diversity Inc. for compiling this list.</p>
<p>This list should be posted on pro-white websites with the explicit purpose of informing whites to consider not applying to these companies and to find alternatives.  </p>

		<p>Speaking of Kaiser, I work there on a contract basis.  This email is received by all employees every Friday sent by the CEO, Diversity in Chief, Mr. George Halvorson.  This came out last Friday, and now I know why due to the reference to Diversity Inc.  I thought fellow Amrenners would enjoy the blatant doublespeak going on below.</p>
<p>Dear KP colleagues,<br>
One of our greatest strengths is our diversity.<br>
Kaiser Permanente is wonderfully diverse. We look today like all of America will look in another decade.<br>
We have a diverse staff, a diverse membership, and a highly diverse governance process.<br>
I have celebrated our diversity before. I have written about the fact that the KP Hospitals and Health Plan<br>
Board of Directors is less than 40 percent white male   &mdash;   in a world where boards of other organizations our<br>
size tend to be more than 80 percent white and more than 80 percent male.<br>
Our workforce is 57 percent minority. We serve members in some of the most diverse cities in America   &mdash;  <br>
Honolulu, San Francisco, San Diego, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland, and Cleveland, Ohio.<br>
We are an extremely high-performing care system. Our diverse teams of caregivers has put us in position<br>
to now have 23 separate HEDIS scores where the highest quality health plan in America is Kaiser<br>
Permanente.<br>
We have won awards that no one else in health care has won for the dependability of our computer<br>
infrastructure   &mdash;   and we have been awarded 35 of the top 55 awards in the country for our hospital<br>
computerization levels. We dominate the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society<br>
(HIMSS) Stage 7 awards.<br>
We have the best computerized medical support tools in the world, and we are working to track care<br>
delivery by race, ethnicity, language, and gender to continually improve our ability to deliver the right care<br>
to all the segments of our patient population.<br>
We have won awards for being a good place to work for LGBT workers, for African-American workers, for<br>
Hispanic women, and   &mdash;   at the end of the month   &mdash;   we will receive an award in New York City for being one<br>
of the best places to work for executive women.<br>
Our CFO will be at the New York meeting giving a speech before we accept the award. She will be a<br>
highlight of their day of learning.<br>
That is not what I am celebrating today.<br>
DiversityInc magazine does an annual review of the 500 leading organizations in America, looking to see<br>
which companies are the best place to work for a diverse workforce.<br>
We made the top 50 on that list three years ago.<br>
We made the top five on that list last year.<br>
This year, we won.<br>
DiversityInc magazine just voted us number one as the organization in America that best related the right<br>
set of values and performance as an employer and worksite.<br>
Sodexo won last year. Johnson &amp; Johnson won the year before. Verizon Communications won the year<br>
before that. Bank of America won four years ago.<br>
This year, the name at the top of the list is Kaiser Permanente.<br>
That&rsquo;s a good place to be.<br>
We are far from perfect. We are learning as we go. We make mistakes. We are sometimes clumsy, and<br>
sometimes go down paths that we need to correct.<br>
Winning this award does not mean that we can say that we have nailed it   &mdash;   that we are as good as we can<br>
be.<br>
Winning this award means that we are doing a lot of things right. Winning this award means we don&rsquo;t<br>
have a glass ceiling and we don&rsquo;t have institutionalized discriminatory practices and that we are eager to<br>
be inclusive and a great place for a very diverse population to work.<br>
We are, as the people of Kaiser Permanente, committed to all of our patients from all of our diverse<br>
populations   &mdash;   and we are committed to being a team with ourselves to deliver great care.<br>
We are far from perfect   &mdash;   but we are trying to do the right things and we are trying to do them for the right<br>
reasons.<br>
For now, I want to celebrate all of the people at Kaiser Permanente who are so wonderfully effective and<br>
collectively caring that we can be a leader in so many ways we deliver care.<br>
Our diversity is one of the reasons we do so well in so many areas.<br>
This level of creativity could never happen in a world of pure clones.<br>
We are smarter and we are better because we are so diverse and we benefit from our diversity.<br>
So thank you to everyone who makes us being diverse so successful. We are learning and, as I said, we<br>
are not perfect   &mdash;   but we are definitely directionally correct.<br>
That&rsquo;s a good place to be.<br>
Be well.<br>
George</p>

		<p>Makes me sick!!!   I belong to Kaiser and I can tell you almost all employees are of color and or gay! I cannot understand half those that I have to see for appointments! Their dialect is atrocious!  Living off my social security retirement I cannot afford good health insurance and medicare of course puts us all right in the worst places to be when it comes to health care. In the very near future there will not be one doctor or nurse that is White in this country, Heaven help us White folk.</p>

		<p>Thank you for posting that atrocious email! What a RACIST email!  Can we as patients demand that they hire MORE Whites at Kaiser? Or will that be on our file in their computers for all to see?  We could expect shabby,  care if we ever did file a complaint, I am sure. I would like to find out more about this George Halvorson and his ethnicity.</p>
<p>Now this really below makes me ill! Tell me why they are tracking care by RACE, etc. to deliver the &#8220;right&#8221; care????????? What is the right care for White patients? A black doctor, a nurse from Nigeria, a &#8220;hispanic&#8221; pharmacist, an Asian radiologist?</p>
<p>I do know I get questionaires all the time in the mail about four pages long about how I rate my doctor/doctors, and it goes for each one I have to see at different times. Is that to see what we put down if we don&rsquo;t like one that is a minority? I will wager it is.<br>

		<p>How sickening anon 8:31! I have noticed this sort of thing at just about any company of any size- most entry level or production employees are majority white but as you go up the chain of command you will see more &#8220;color&#8221; or blatant gays. At one job I worked at I had a friend who had applied several times for higher management jobs that were posted. He had an excellent work history and evaluations and had been called in for several interviews but had never been offered positions. Just about every management position went to a black, woman or very open gay.</p>

		<p>A very liberal white co-worker I used to know once worked at Sodexo. When I told her I was applying there she said not to bother. Whites are all but excluded from jobs there. Even she said it was unfair and was part of the reason she got out (she was passed up for a promotion because of her skin condition).</p>
<p>The catalyst was apparently a lawsuit several years ago that almost killed the company. </p>
<p>By the way, Sodexo is a food service company. If they serve your business, school or office building, be sure to avoid them.</p>

		<p>Stephen Rizley, a SR VP representing Cox Communications, also  signed the infamous letter to the Arizona Senate demanding they not pass any more immigration enforcement legilsation. In addition, the billionaire Cox family - Anne Cox Chambers et al - are neck dep in support of left-wing politicians.</p>
<p>Cox Communications is a cable and internet provider. It&rsquo;s very hard to boycott random businesses for small expenses, or if their products are significantly superior to alternatives, but given the amount of money people spend on cable and internet access these days (often &gt; $1,000/year), I would strongly urge absolutely everyone who is in a Cox market to switch to alternatives like DSL or dish, and to call Cox to tell the why. Some cell phone companies like Verizon even provide cable access now, and you can save a bundle if you bundle.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to show no loyalty as a customer. Stick with them through the cheap intro rates then switch when they jack their rates up to normal.</p>

____________________________________________________</p>
<p>There was a recent survey done on customer service at cell phone companies and it appears that ATT had one of the WORST ratings by far. </p>
<p>As someone who has a contract with this company, I have to agree - their &#8220;customer service&#8221; reps are anything but helpful.</p>
<p>I believe their #1 ranking on the  &#8220;DiversityInc Top 10 Companies for Blacks&#8221; may be the reason for their LAST-place position in customer service surveys.</p>

		<p>Given all the guilt in the Kaiser email, I would venture a guess that good old George is a white male - one who isn&rsquo;t stepping aside himself.  Then again, since non-whites can write these same things with impunity, so I can&rsquo;t be sure of his race.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s hard to know where to start being offended, with so much to choose from.  It puts the UCLA girl&rsquo;s video to shame by comparison.  Assuming that whites are &#8220;clones&#8221;; pretending that the company is &#8220;smarter&#8221; because of Hispanics and blacks, when in reality it is the whites and Asians who are the smart ones, and the other ones are merely following the processes at the grunt-worker level.  As if the blacks and Hispanics developed all the sophisticated computer systems!  What a joke.  </p>
<p>The self-congratulation alone is enough to make one sick, especially since one can see through it all to get to the underlying hypocrisy.  Quote:  &#8220;we don&rsquo;t have institutionalized discriminatory practices&#8221;.  But they do - directed at the white males who are trying bravely to keep the company functioning properly, in the face of unhelpful racial diversity.  For that matter, Kaiser is &#8220;underpresenting&#8221; whites, if whites are only 43% of its workforce, yet roughly two thirds of the population at large.  That must be a sign of racism, right?  Or so it would be, were not whites the race in question.</p>
<p>The truth is, Kaiser must heavily hire blacks, Hispanics, Phillipinos, etc., for all the non-essential jobs that don&rsquo;t require a high level of intelligence, and they use an affirmative action approach to promotions.  Then they try to make the untenable link between their racial diversity and any successful results in the marketplace.</p>
<p>What offends me most of all is that this jerk draws a good salary for spouting out this garbage.  In a perfect world, his position and his entire department should be wiped out.</p>

		<p>I opined above that George must be a white male.  I just googled him.  Turns out he&rsquo;s the CEO, and yep, he&rsquo;s an older white guy.  So he has some nerve writing all these things.  To have any integrity, he must forfeit his own position in favor of a non-white.  Funny how he hasn&rsquo;t done that.  In the meantime, he should keep his mouth shut.</p>

		<p>I am not surprised to hear abut AT&T; or Sodexho.  I used to work at a bank which was across from a college.  The college used Sodexho.  I dreaded every Thursday, being payday&hellip;the blacks just flocked to the bank to cash their paycheck from Sodexho.  NONE of the blacks had an account&hellip;.go figure!<br>
A very good friend of mine quit AT&T; recently.  She hated the blacks, always complaining about then being loud mouth &amp; causing problems.  One black (very large!) girl sat next to my friend &amp; would always go thru my friend&rsquo;s desk when she wasn&rsquo;t there trying to find candy &amp; snacks!  </p>

		<p>This makes me feel even better that I recently dropped AT&T.;  I wonder what sort of makework jobs Northrup Grumman provides for their diverse employees?  I guess getting those gov&rsquo;t contracts comes at a price.</p>

		<p>Speaking of AT&T;, I didn&rsquo;t see Vonage listed in the top 10.  You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d be choked full of diversity with all those offensive commercials they run. One shows a militant feminist bumping a goofy White male off the TV screen. Then it switches to interviews with customers, one black and two White guys that my discerning eye tells me are homosexuals. There&rsquo;s another commercial where you see lots of &#8220;exotic&#8221; people.     </p>
