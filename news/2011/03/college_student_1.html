<h1>College Student Targets North Texas, Bush Residence</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Laura Garsea, Richland Chronicle (Richland College, Texas), February 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A former Texas Tech student was arrested last week accused of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p>FBI agents uncovered evidence they believe showed that the student was attempting to create an improvised explosive device (IED) targeting several locations, including Dallas.</p>
<p>Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, a 20-year-old Saudi Arabian national, is a business student at South Plains College near Lubbock.</p>
<p>He {snip} has been in the United States since 2008 on a student visa.</p>
<p>Aldawsari allegedly e-mailed himself potential targets that included the North Dallas address of former President George W. Bush, nuclear power plants and 12 reservoir dams in Colorado and California.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Legally authorized electronic surveillance showed that e-mails that Aldawsari sent himself included information relating to research regarding his targets, explosives and their contents.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other e-mails also showed evidence that Aldawsari planned on hiding explosives and weapons in realistic dolls and baby carriages.</p>
<p>The surveillance also found that on Feb. 19, Aldawsari made the following key-word searches: &#8220;party in dallas&#8221;, &#8220;can u take a backpack to nightclub&#8221; and &#8220;dallas night clubs.&#8221;</p>
<p>These terms potentially &#8220;indicate Aldawsari&rsquo;s consideration of targeting a nightclub with an explosive concealed in a backpack,&#8221; the affidavit stated.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other confirmation e-mails from Amazon.com included items such as a 3.2 million-volt stun gun with built-in flashlight, miniature Christmas lights, Pyrex flasks and a chemistry laboratory set.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>During the search, a personal journal was discovered that was written in Arabic. Translation of the journal indicated that Aldawsari had been planning an attack on the United States for years.</p>
<p>&#8220;I excelled in my studies in high school in order to take advantage of an opportunity for a scholarship to America, offered by the Saululi government and its companies,&#8221; Aldawsari&rsquo;s diary read. &#8220;[The] financial scholarship is the largest, which will help me tremendously in providing me with the support I need for Jihad, God willing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another entry, Aldawsari listed a &#8220;synopsis of important steps&#8221; where he noted what he needed to do in order to accomplish his goals.</p>
<p>The steps were listed as follows: obtaining a forged U.S. birth certificate, applying for a U.S. passport and driver&rsquo;s license, traveling to New York for at least a week, renting a car via the Internet, changing clothing and appearance before picking up the car, using a different driver&rsquo;s license for each car rented, preparing the bombs for remote detonation, putting bombs into cars and taking them to different places during rush hour and finally leaving the city for a safe place.</p>

		<p>Karma alert:  This accused Saudi student was legally in the United States due to a student visa program with Saudi Arabia that President Bush (43) explicitly demanded, advocated and signed off on.</p>

		<p>Predicts&hellip;&hellip;the Saudi government will intervene and bring this criminal back to Saudi for better training at which time, he will be redeployed with better computer skills and a list of pre approved targets.</p>

		<p>Hey, America   &mdash;   when you gonna GET the fact that Islam teaches its adherents to kill ALL non-Muslims, that it is Islam&rsquo;s sole purpose to take over the entire world, including the U.S., by any means necessary, and that they will be happy to behead YOU and your family if you say anything against them or their political organization that masquerades as a religion?  We have GOT to realize what we&rsquo;re dealing with here - Muslims are out to kill every single person who isn&rsquo;t Muslim AND take everything they own, as well as put ALL women into slavery.  Harsh?  Yes.  But Islam is every bit as harsh and more.  We need to get about the business of getting rid of Islam and its practitioners in this country.  We can deal with them OUTSIDE of our borders - but they need to leave the hospitality of America.  What nearly happened to George Bush, his property, and quite a few pieces of our infrastructure will happen to each of us if we don&rsquo;t get rid of this menace.</p>

		<p>Absolutely amazing how quickly this story has dropped out of favor with the MSM.</p>
<p>No shortage of air time or ink though for Charlie Sheen. </p>
<p>Some things are just more important to cover than others, I suppose. </p>

		<p>Talk about ungrateful! It was GWB decision to allow more Arabians in to study. The lesson here is never help a moslem.</p>

		<p>At the very least, this SOB should spend life in prison with no parole - preferably in the can at Huntsville, TX - if he is convicted.</p>

		<p>FOIA Documents recently revealed a plan to target everyday American pedestrians with backscatter X-rays by the TSA and yet we still approve hordes of Muslim VISA&rsquo;s?  Outrageous.</p>
<p>Want proof that these student VISA&rsquo;s have nothing to do with an exchange of ideas?  I know for a fact that the US government sponsors an exchange program for law students from all over the world so they may have the benefit to learn from our prestigious universities, and afterward are allegedly sent home.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem, you may ask?  The most glaringly obvious reason is that most of the world is under the completely different legal system of coded Civil Law. This is totally contradictory to our inherited English Common Law.  Anything these immigrants learn here will be utterly useless in their home countries unless they, too, happen to be from a former British colony.</p>
<p>There is no benefit to either party.  Our government is simply trying to replace our free-born population with a third-world slave population and they don&rsquo;t care who gets hurt.</p>

		<p>I doubt this guy is going to do any time in Huntsville, Soprano Fan.  The WMD charges along with the target list including nuclear power plants, dams and former President Shrubya instantly make the case federal.  The smart money is that Aldawsari ends up at the federal AdMax in Florence, Colorado; life on 23-hour lockdown starting at age 20!  </p>
<p>That was quick, Khalid.</p>
