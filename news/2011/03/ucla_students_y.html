			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Parkinson-Morgan, Daily Bruin (University of California), March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A UCLA student has received multiple death threats in response to her video &#8220;Asians in the Library,&#8221; which was posted Friday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The video quickly went viral and, despite being removed by Wallace on Sunday, has since been reposted under different accounts on YouTube and other websites.</p>
<p>[Wallace contacted university police early Sunday evening after receiving numerous threats via e-mail and phone, said UCPD spokeswoman Nancy Greenstein. UPDATED: UCPD cannot confirm or deny that any of the threats were death threats.]</p>
<p>Police advised her to take a number of precautions and are currently working to ensure her safety, Greenstein said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&rsquo;s received a death threat, I find that as deplorable as her original YouTube video. If this is the response of students on campus, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do,&#8221; said Robert Naples, associate vice chancellor and dean of students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Speaking Sunday night, a university spokesman called the video &#8220;repugnant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallace sent a statement to the Daily Bruin early Monday morning apologizing for her remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the original video posted by me was inappropriate,&#8221; she said in the statement. &#8220;I cannot explain what possessed me to approach the subject as I did, and if I could undo it, I would. I&rsquo;d like to offer my apology to the entire UCLA campus. For those who cannot find it within them to accept my apology, I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Students also took to various forms of social media, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Hundreds of comments were also posted on Chancellor Gene Block&rsquo;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>A Facebook user under the name &#8220;Alexandra Wallace&#8221; posted an apology on Block&rsquo;s Facebook page on Sunday night. However, Wallace said she did not write the posts, stating that she does not have a Facebook account.</p>
<p>Phil Gussin, Wallace&rsquo;s political science professor, said Wallace contacted him with concern about how she would take her finals.</p>
<p>Gussin said Wallace told him that police advised her to reschedule her final exams in light of death threats she received and information posted online that listed her class schedule and exam locations.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gussin said he is concerned for Wallace&rsquo;s safety and is frustrated at the violent response some people have expressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Wallace did was hurtful and inexcusable, but the response has been far more egregious,&#8221; Gussin said. &#8220;She made a big mistake, and she knows it, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they responded with greater levels of intolerance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naples said the university will examine Wallace&rsquo;s video to see if it violates any part of the student code of conduct. But he cautioned that the code does not usurp the authority of the First Amendment.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s really disgusting the way threats are so readily thrown at white people who criticize non-whites.  Yet, whites are expected to accept ALL criticism with a smile no matter how vile the content or the critic.  I fear for her safety and I&rsquo;m certain that when she is assaulted, nobody will come to her aid and the courts will coddle her assailants.  While her rant was stupid, I have seen worse on BET presented as &#8220;comedy&#8221;.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;What Wallace did was hurtful &hellip;&rdquo; Maybe so, but it was so true.  I know. I have been married to an asian woman for many years, and lived in an asian community in Los Angeles for several years.  What this young lady said hit the nail on the head.  Asian families do not teach or encourage the type of  manners people of European descent expect. The young asians are also kept as &#8216;children&rsquo; until they are near thirty, with their parents and extended families caring for them.  I know the truth hurts, but does it deserve death threats?</p>

		<p>So true.  Lesson:  Only Whites can be disparaged.  No one else.  And what&rsquo;s this bull about Asians being so non-violent?  About the crime rate of Asians being so low?  One thing is practically for certain.  It was Asians that were sending death threats and nobody else.  They were doing a lot worse than Alexandra.  How about we get more students like Alexandra, except for the apologizing that is.  The apologizing has to go.</p>

<p>Criticizing Asians for being noisy in the library is justified.  Bringing up the topic of the tsunami in Japan in her criticism is NOT appropriate, and neither is this video in general.</p>

		<p>She wasn&rsquo;t mean, just honest.  She wasn&rsquo;t ranting, she actually sounded a little dippy to me and hardly offensive. And actually politically correct, she said that it was OK for Asians to be at UCLA.  The truth can not said out loud.  You shouldn&rsquo;t be talking on a cell phone, talking out loud, in a library.  That is just a given.  The people she sees are rude.  No, ifs and or buts.   When in Rome do as the Romans.</p>
<p>Death threats against what this girl said should be proof enough of what these third world invaders will do to us when they have the chance.  Forget the first amendment, our lives are endangered!<br>

While as a University student it would have been appropriate for Alexandra&rsquo;s comments to have been better worded,              she speaks for everyone regardless of race.</p>
<p>If Alexandra Wallace did not speak the truth, America would not have witnessed the depth of California&rsquo;s racism towards whites.</p>
<p>Asians in California and encleaves across the U.S. are too numerous to be willing to assimilate, much too uneducated to understand the comlex issue of race, and far too undeserving to live in the land that our forefathers built.</p>

		<p>So a death threat is merely &#8220;as deplorable&#8221;, and not &#8220;more deplorable&#8221;, than the video?</p>
<p>And since when do the officers of a college campus find free speech &#8220;repugnant&#8221;, especially when I&rsquo;ll wager she has pointed out two issues that should be addressed by said officials?</p>
<p>There are two points being expressed in the video - noisy family visits and noisy library cell phone usage.  The noise is apparently coming from Asians, and was bothersome enough for this girl to make the video in the first place.</p>
<p>There is nothing for which she needed to apologize.</p>
<p>I would say that the offended ones are not too bright, but actually this is simply an excuse to further the cause of &#8220;anything derogatory that whites say about non-whites is de facto racism, no matter how true&#8221;.<br>

		<p>She comes across as immature in the video, and it is a crass thing to mention the tsunami in such a glib way.  The people of Japan are in serious trouble.  The earthquake and tsunami were davastating.  And she is a bimbo for being so insensitive.  I think that is where the anger is  coming from.</p>
<p>I am white and I am no suppoter of these liberal school officials that exaggerate every offense against nonwhites while excusing offenses against whites.  And I am not saying any death threat is justified.  Any death threat should be taken seriously.  But other than that, she wont get any sympathy from me.</p>

		<p>This video was prominently displayed on the NY Daily News site along with a big caption stating that it was horribly racist especially in light of the Japanese earthquake.</p>
<p>In my opinion this may very well be a harbinger of things to come. The video was fairly tame-I&rsquo;ve seen much worse posted by non-whites critiquing whites that was met with praise not condemnation. We must not be lulled into thinking that all groups are the same-blacks and latinos are a threat on a different (lower) level while Asians due to their achievement and wealth are a vastly superior threat. </p>
<p>It is hard not to feel the situation is doomed, if only we could go back in time and halt the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act.</p>

		<p>This whole story is a sign of just how sick, distorted and downright mad our society has become. How about this statement from the associate vice chancellor: &ldquo;If she&rsquo;s received a death threat, I find that as deplorable as her original YouTube video.&#8221; Just &#8220;as deplorable?&#8221; Death threats are not actually MORE deplorable than stating an opinion? Sick.</p>
<p>Concerning the apology Wallace offered: &#8220;For those who cannot find it within them to accept my apology, I understand.&rdquo; Is she not in fact saying, &#8220;If someone carries out these death threats against me, it&rsquo;s perfectly understandable?&#8221;  Is this not the ultimate act of groveling?</p>

		<p>As I sit here, I am trying to work out why has this video gone viral?<br>
Considering the amount of similar or worst material out there, for some reason this video has either hit a cord or has been heavily promoted by God knows who. </p>
<p>The three things that come to mind that make this video a perfect candidate for the cultural Marxists to reiterate the current political status quo <br>
1. A specific institution was named. <br>
2. A specific ethnicity was named. <br>
3. The demography of the presenter and the fact that she was not anonymous, thus is perfect for public vilification.<br>
 <br>
This girl&rsquo;s full name has been plastered everywhere, as well as the numerous death threats, there are reports of possible criminal charges along with repercussions at her school. Her and her family&rsquo;s name is dirt, at least until the public moves on.</p>
<p>She obviously seriously under estimated her speech&rsquo;s effect, as would have I.<br>
Is that the lesson we&rsquo;re meant to be getting from this? </p>
<p>&ldquo;White people have to stay anonymous or just completely silent when mentioning other racial groups&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Is the price this girl is paying, worth the crime?</p>
<p>The timing of the Tsunami, and specifically mentioning the Tsunami in her rant was not well thought out considering how much the current day media sensationalizes such events, taking us all through a HD emotional rollercoaster ride, where one can only empathize. And the Charlie Chan imitation was not a good look. <br>
But again this reaction is overkill.</p>
<p>We all condemn certain Islamic countries for their insistence on continuing the brutal act of a group stoning as a form of capital punishment (execution by torture).</p>
<p>Yet here is our Western version for the crime of racial or &lsquo;cultural&rsquo; blasphemy.</p>
<p>Reminds me a little of the Miss California Carrie Prejean scandal, where she was thrown to blood thirsty masses.Nothing Miss Prejean could do in the mainstream&rsquo;s eyes could ever be perceived to be right, so she suffered public smear after public smear. While the truly hateful back slap each other, full of self congratulation for their own &lsquo;correct&rsquo; judgments and consequential condemnations. </p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s this girl&rsquo;s motives that the masses find so despicable, &ldquo;how dare she expect foreigners to assimilate to the local (White)culture.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Quote: &ldquo;We judge others by their behavior. We judge ourselves by our intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masses intentions do not bode well for White America.<br>

		<p>100% expected.  I believe this is one of the reasons people have been slow to acknowledge the incompetence of the Japanese government to the earthquake/tsnami/nuclear meltdown disasters.  People fear getting on the wrong side of East Asians.  East Asians have a track record of being vindictive and destructive to those that critisize East Asians.  Five or so years ago, Desperate Housewives made a joke about Fillipino doctors.  In response the Fillipino government demanded millions of dollars, a formal appology and cancellation of the show by ABC. Sharon Stone said the earthquakes in China might have been karma because of human rights violations.  The Chinese government then banned all Sharon Stone movies past and future.</p>

		<p>As I live in San Francisco and have contact with Asians regularly, I can state that everything said in this video is true. Asians do not talk into cell phones, they yell! Asians do not like to sit on bus seats together and talk, they prefer to get seperate seats so they can yell at each other. Ms. Wallace stated that Asians &#8220;don&rsquo;t teach their kids to fend for themselves.&#8221; That is very true, I have worked with Asians who do not know how to cook and Mom comes over to clean their homes regularly. Last summer when camping at Yellowstone, six Asians were next to us. They unloaded boxes of firewood and newspapers to start the fire. The next morning they left the campsite and the unburned newspapers were scattered by the wind around their area. My friend (from Texas) remarked that those kids need to clean that up. I laughed and said that those kids have never cleaned anything up in their lives. The Asians left for the day and returned to build a fire that night. In the morning more papers were scattered around and they left for the day again. A Park Ranger came and cleaned up the area and no doubt they got a fine. I applaud Ms. Wallace for telling the truth.</p>

		<p>Funny, I don&rsquo;t recall the UCLA community having the same volatile reaction when the racist Chinese professor by the name of Kent Wong made what many would consider racist remarks toward &#8220;old White guys!&#8221; Where was the concern from the Asian community in that case? <br>
Is Professor Wong still a part of the facility at UCLA? That&rsquo;s what I thought! </p>
<p>The only reason the Asians are (or anyone for that matter) up in arms is because Wallace is White! As long as Wong remains, so to should Wallace! So for all those calling for her expulsion, I would suggest you look up the word hypocrite! </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain a student at UCLA could muster up a dictionary. <br>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the surprise here?  A little constructive criticism is a check and balance and there is nothing wrong with a check and balance.  I don&rsquo;t believe she said anything that wasn&rsquo;t true although the tsunami comment was in extremely poor taste.</p>
<p>Since whites are so afraid to defend themselves, I say let the attacks on them continue.  Eventually, which may be even more years from now, they will reach the breaking point and things will get very ugly, very quickly.  Look at white history.  They are patient and then they are vicious.</p>
<p>As for the video, the Asian imports of today are not the same as the ones of yesterday.  Another reason is there are more of them now and percentage trumps everything!

		<p>Clearly, the outrage over this hapless Valley Girl&rsquo;s comments is ridiculously overblown.  And she&rsquo;s right, East Asians in particular think nothing of carrying on private conversations in public - I imagine it derives from coming from cultures in which overcrowding and lack of privacy are the norm.  They aren&rsquo;t intending to be rude in doing so; it&rsquo;s the norm for them, just as silence is the norm for American libraries.</p>
<p>I suspect if it were explained to them during freshman orientation that talking in American libraries is considered rude that they&rsquo;d knock it off.</p>

		<p>The only reason so many Asians are in UCLA is due to the anti white nature of the institution and them taking full advantage of affirmative action. How many whites with good or better grades get passed over for an Asian student in that school?</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a sad but telling story of education in China. When I came here, I too taught at a university where cheating was so rampant that I like many I knew gave up on education in China, they do not have the same values and beliefs and cheating is so rampant that it makes academia a farce. As I have stated, I have been told to change grades and when I did not do so, they were changed anyway. To me the idea of advanced learning in China is not a farce, but not too far from it.<br>
 <br>
The credibility of this place is horrible.</p>
<p>The story below talks about a US university who has learned this the hard way. Due to rampant cheating they are forcing students to take a comprehensive exam or get a tuition refund instead of their diplomas. The cheating Chinese are opting for the latter. How unfortunate that you cannot come to China and do business like you can in the rest of the world&hellip;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who believes that these people flood top Universities by hard work alone is a fool.</p>

		<p>Who were the death threats from?  Were they from Asian students?  That was not made clear. (I speculate it was not.) What was clear was that it was the marxist whites who seemed to think this video was significant at all. </p>
<p>It is marxist whites who created an anti-white, anti free speech environment on every college campus in the USA.  It is marxist whites who enable non White immigration.  It is marxist whites who terrorized this girl into apologizing when she had nothing to apologize for.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t have a problem with a students extended family helping them with food, laundry, and education.  Good for them.  There are plenty of White families who could learn a thing or two from that.</p>

		<p>I looked at the comments on Youtube where her video was posted, and also the comments on a video posted by an Asian (Oriental). <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6z3fxt5" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/6z3fxt5</a></p>
<p>She claims she is politically incorrect, but she was politically correct enough to use the word Asian which is less accurate than Oriental which would better describe the people she was talking about. She sure wasn&rsquo;t talking about Iranians, or Indians and they are Asians.</p>
<p>At any rate the comments on both sites were overwhelmingly against her. Some seem barely literate, and excoriated her for what she said, while seeming not to understand that they were making hateful comments about her. She wasn&rsquo;t hateful, she just expressed her opinion. Some would agree with her, and many would not, or at least feel that they could not express it.</p>
<p>The Oriental guy even suggested threats to her, and then would say he was just kidding. I notice that since I first saw his video there is a text box addition saying not to harm her. Some may say that he did not threaten her, but I&rsquo;ll guarantee you that if he had made the same statements and directed them toward the President of the US, he would have been visited by the Secret Service, and likely would have been arrested.</p>
<p>A black guy posted a video, and it is no surprise that it is hard to understand. <a href="http://tinyurl.com/64bvh43" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/64bvh43</a></p>

		<p>To me this came across as rather benign.  Maybe it&rsquo;s because she seems so dingy while making her complaints or maybe it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s such a hot girl.  </p>
<p>I like the part in the video where she goes &#8220;shhhh.&#8221;  Someone should take a screen shot of that moment and put it on a t-shirt with a caption that says, &#8220;Shhhh.  No talking in the library.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a minor point, did anyone notice one of her contradictions in this video?  First she uses Chinese gibberish (ching, chang, etc.) to describe those on their cell phones in the library, and then she brings up Japan.  Hey, at least keep the ridicule consistent.

		<p>Among the responses to this video from Asians, none show any humility for being in a foreign land disturbing the host.  Most come out swinging.</p>
<p>Asians (and nearly every other non-white group) justify their presence in our lands by accepting the self-serving moral argument that whites &#8220;did evil in the past, and therefore have no moral right to defend themselves or their land&#8221;.  It is a tremendous leap of logic, and every unspoken excuse they have for invading our home revolves around this libel.  That&rsquo;s why they never apologize.</p>

<p>Affirmative action works against Northeast Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans). Because of affirmative action in college admissions, if there are two students, one White and one Chinese, and both have the same grades, test scores, and activities, it&rsquo;s easier for the White person to get admitted than it is for the Chinese person. </p>

		<p>Try Googling the following search string: psychologytoday alexandra wallace.</p>
<p>The first entry in the search result should be an article entitled, &#8220;(Why) Do Asian Americans have a target on their backs?&#8221;<br>
A UCLA student&rsquo;s racist video raises troubling questions.<br>
Published on March 16, 2011<br>
http://tinyurl.com/658mx8r</p>
<p>Here are a few important excerpts from the above web article:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a guest post by Anna Lau, Ph.D., a professor of clinical psychology at UCLA.<br>
&hellip;<br>
Ms. Wallace&rsquo;s main complaint was an Asian American student taking cell phone calls in the library when she was trying to study for her finals. Okay, that would be pretty annoying. But why did Ms. Wallace&rsquo;s locate the cause of the poor behavior in the students&rsquo; ethnicity?<br>
&hellip;<br>
In other words, she suffers from confirmation bias, and in that she is not alone. (Note: at the beginning of her video Ms. Wallace gives a kind of shout-out to her Asian friends with whom she has no problem).<br>
&hellip;<br>
But what would embolden Ms. Wallace to post her anti-Asian sentiments so publicly, when 2 of 5 UCLA students are Asian American? I mean she took it all the way to &#8220;Ching-chong, ting-tong, ling-long&#8221;, she only forgot to tug at the corners of her eyes to produce the full effect. Ching chong is the Asian American equivalent of the N-word. Have we not learned this from Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s gaffe? So, what possessed Ms. Wallace? A couple hypotheses to ponder<br>
&hellip;<br>
1. Yellow Peril and the modern day threat of the Model Minority. <br>
&hellip;<br>
But what is maintaining these feelings today? Long before and ever since that Time Magazine cover, the model minority has been seen as a threat in American schools.<br>
&hellip;<br>
Maddux et al. (2008) showed that positive stereotypes of Asian Americans as smart and hard-working can arouse antipathy among other students.<br>
&hellip;<br>
These results are sort of amusing and it&rsquo;s tempting to dismiss these experiments as lacking ecological validity. But a study of actual race relations among students at UCLA showed that increased contact with students from other ethnic groups increased positive attitudes and reduced prejudice toward those groups for everyone EXCEPT Asian Americans (van Laar et al., 2005). This is a prime example of the model minority problem.<br>
&hellip;<br>
Asian Americans are not safe from discrimination on campus because of their number. Actually the opposite is probably true.<br>
&hellip;<br>
2. The Perpetual Foreigner and De-humanization.<br>
&hellip;<br>
I&rsquo;ve learned that anti-Asian American sentiment is not only widespread, it&rsquo;s also socially acceptable.<br>
&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>Although not mentioned in the above article.  I believe that Miss. Wallace has very severe psychological issues regarding love within families and with pain, suffering, and death, as demonstrated by her apparent frustration with members of families showing love toward their children (mothers cooking for their child students) and as demonstrated by her flippant and egregious remarks regarding the recent earthquake near Japan (9.0 earthquake, tsunami, and at least 10,000 dead).</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

		<p>The continuing and increasingly hostile behavior of nonwhites towards whites is forcing us together as a race. You can see this happening before your eyes. They&rsquo;re forcing nature to take its course. And in terms of the natural ladder, we&rsquo;re looking down from the highest rung. This plays to our advantage. Every time I see whites mistreated I&rsquo;m that much more excited, because I know the end result will be a reawakening to the realities of race.   </p>

<p>Why oh why do whites retreat and grovel?! There was nothing wrong with that video. If anything maybe Asians might think twice about talking into their cellphones in the library or letting their entire extended family invade their campus apartments. Maybe calling them out on their&hellip;exotic behavior might offer them some incentive to conform to OUR ways.</p>

		<p>This would be just a lame comedy routine on BET or that Wow-a-smart-latino Mind of Mencia show, not even very funny because it isn&rsquo;t mean-spirited or exagerrated enough.</p>
<p>The extreme anti-white, anti-Christian values biase of all public institutions nowadays just baffles me. Even the comment about the tsunami didn&rsquo;t seem like much more than a statement of fact. If someone takes a call in the library about that event, it&rsquo;s likely to be a long and emotional discussion&hellip; True or false? So, the wise and courteous thing to do would be to take the call outside&hellip; True or false? But then, death threats and disciplinary action for telling what&rsquo;s true does not surprise me at all anymore. </p>
<p>That being said, black behavior is the real yardstick of obnoxiousness, and the girl should be happy that most blacks never get into the UC system. Generally, if you ask an Asian to follow rules he will. Ask a black, and he&rsquo;ll threaten to kill you if not assault you on the spot, then threaten to kill the library personnel, then threaten the security guard, then hoot and holler at the campus police as they cuff him and haul him away&hellip;</p>

		<p>A few things need to be clarified. The urge to summarily label people as Asian does a disservice. There are HUGE differences between cultures, and what constitutes manners and etiquette vary greatly. The Filipinos, Koreans, Japanese, mainland Chinese, Malays etc. have behaviours and attitudes vastly different from one another. Albeit some generalizations can be made (strong family ties, emphasis on education etc.), but my point still stands. I hope this broad gets a good wakeup call. </p>
<p>You really must appreciate the irony that this is UCLA: the enlightened liberal fortress.    </p>

Alexandra Wallace - a political science major ( huh&hellip;just as I expected, another useless degree most white kids nowadays are too lazy to study the sciences, so they cop out with worthless degrees in philosophy, religion or political science etc)</p>
<p>While she may have had a legit issue about people speaking on their cell phones, there was no need to mock the Asian accent or make xenophobic comments on older Asian women and children, plus her utter insensitivity towards concerned kids calling home to check on their families after the Tsunami tragedy in Japan. Lets face it, like most present generation American youth today, the likes of Ms Wallace portray the archetypal incompetent spoiled brat who cannot hack it up to the higher IQ and educational standards of Asians ( Japan, India, China, S Korea)and success in the work place. This creates a sense of resentment towards the model minority and unconsciously makes her seek attention by posting a ridiculous video on a public internet forum. </p>

It was not until I was pushing the big three oh that I conceded that there is some truth in stereotypes and prejudices, although the truth is imprecise. My epiphany came when two at risk youths of a disadvantaged race robbed me at gun point. Since then my melancholy reflections about that race have been reinforced several times in similar ways.<br>
 <br>
BTW, every member of that race that I know by name I like. <br>
 <br>
I have known quite a few Orientals over the years. Without exception they have not only been intelligent, as Professor Philippe Rushton maintains, but also courteous and decent.<br>
 <br>
Others have had different experiences with Orientals. Nevertheless, I suspect that most who resent them resent them for their academic success. In the main this success is not due to cheating, but hard work and native intelligence.</p>

I lived in Asia for several years. What the young lady described is an absolute truth. Asians generally and Chinese specifically are obnoxiously loud and only see the ends of their own noses.

<p>I work regularly overseas and I can tell you that noisy all night religius precessions in India, irritating calls to prayer pretty much ensure a bad nights sleep and poor workers.</p>

		<p>A UCLA student has received multiple death threats in response to her video &ldquo;Asians in the Library,&rdquo; which was posted Friday.</p>
<p>Awwww, did someone get his feeling hurt?</p>
<p>This is disturbing on a deeper level:  That of the eroding of First Amendment Rights, especially as pertains to Whites.  The authorities should go after those making Death Threats instead of an immature co-ed making stupid quasi-racial comments on a silly site such as Facebook.  </p>
<p>Was this not the purpose of he First Amendment?  To protect unpopular speech?  To prevent a knock on the door or a knock on the head in the middle of the night or loss of liberty due to something one said?  Aren&rsquo;t our brave soldiers in the Middle East tarpit fighting to uphold our right to speak (even if they don&rsquo;t like it, as they themselves say)?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be angry too if anyone, Asians or otherwise, thought it was OK to disturb others in a Library, of all places, where quiet should be enforced, where one would expect NOT to be disturbed by loud cell-phone calls, rude or otherwise.  This is what the Asians should be told:  Follow the Rule of Law or Get Out.</p>
<p>Hurt Feelings Against non-Whites by Whites = Justification for Death Threats, Firings, Ruining of Reputations, Charges of &#8220;Hate Speech&#8221; and Hate Crimes.  Yesterday, there were call for her Expulsion and groups of students were hanging out outside where the &#8220;perp&#8221; was supposed to have taken her finals. Why didn&rsquo;t the university put a stop to those stalking this student and charge them with harassment?  Vow to track down anyone making death threats against one of their students?</p>
<p>(it is because UCLA despises Whites).</p>
<p>This is always the danger of allowing &#8220;others&#8221; into White-created societies: A break-down of White Rule of Law which &#8220;others&#8221; feel doesn&rsquo;t apply to them, only to Whites.  We Whites are mandated to respect and kow-tow to THEIR cultures, not our own.</p>
<p>I expect more new calls for more Hate Speech legislation and Freedom of Speech Zones in universities which the PLF has dismantled one by one, fighting a Sisyphean battle which they will certainly lose in the long run.</p>
<p>Liberty cannot exist without Freedom of Speech only anarchy or totalitarianism as our new masters suppress us via made-up laws enforcing what they say is multiculturalism, equality, or social justice.</p>
<p>According to the new order, The First Amendment only applies to non-Whites who spew invective, including death threats, against Whites across the media daily, Whites who try the same thing put themselves at grave risk.</p>

		<p>I think she was  right in what she said and that she said it. There is something to be said about presentation.  first of all, it seems to be common now that girls are dressed up like streetwalkers. I felt uncomfortable looking at her.  Notice how she does not come out and state clearly and directly what she has to say, no, twisting and turning, try not to be offencive but still wanting to get her point across. The kind of polite she mentions is whimpy. And so are whites in general. And it is hypocritical to try to be so nice to Asiens and Blacks. We once took a mentally quite handicapped white German girl along to a play. (school presentation at an American Highschool overseas) She had a cellphone (which I was not aware of) and it did ring .  Nobody was nice or polite to her. yep, bunch of hypocrytes.  Say what you have to say kiddo. I hope Miss Wallace will not melt away. but strengthen her back bone. </p>

Not one word of scolding, not one &#8220;tsk tsk&#8221; about the Asians disturbing others in the library and the apartment building!  Once again, whites are held to a ridiculously higher standard.  Anything whites do that is the least bit insensitive is criticized harshly, up to and including death threats.  But nonwhites are so precious, so sensitive, they are free to do whatever rude things they please without one word being said about it.</p>

		<p>I suppose Ms.Wallace has taken one too many courses from the esteemed Professor Kent Wong. Had she been paying attention in class, she would have remembered the targets of racial bigotry must always be celebrated, encouraged and directed at &#8220;old White men&#8221; being displaced by the hordes of illegal invading Mexicans. Heck, even suggesting that Whites die off in order to hasten the transformation is ok so long as it&rsquo;s Whites you would like to see expire! </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s give Ms.Wallace a break. I&rsquo;m sure if she is allowed to repeat Professor Wong&rsquo;s course, she will fully understand that the racial insensitivities  must always be directed at Whites in this country. If you can get it right then anything is possible, even tenure at UCLA.</p>

While she may have had a legit issue about people speaking on their cell phones, there was no need to mock the Asian accent or make xenophobic comments on older Asian women and children, plus her utter insensitivity towards concerned kids calling home to check on their families after the Tsunami tragedy in Japan. Lets face it, like most present generation American youth today, the likes of Ms Wallace portray the archetypal incompetent spoiled brat who cannot hack it up to the higher IQ and educational standards of Asians ( Japan, India, China, S Korea)and success in the work place. This creates a sense of resentment towards the model minority and unconsciously makes her seek attention by posting a ridiculous video on a public internet forum. </p>
<p><br>
what she said was not well said. She is a product of dumbed down America. From my experience, it is not so much  superior intelligence but determination and ambition that gets Asien students to the front. Not the least the determination and ambition of their families. The average Americans have that bred out of them.&#8221;  </p>
<p>May I remind you it was  white males who invented/developed everything on the globe?  I am old enough to remember when in the sixties Japanese were considered great copiers. I remember when arranged tours through German factories were not allowed anymore, because the Japanese were spying out everything. (that is what our student group was told).<br>
 American youth have been corrupted and dumbed down, that is the tragic reality.   I would not call her archetypical.  That, sir, is insulting. 50 Years ago she would have looked and talked differently.  You obviously do not share our concern about what is happening, and why and how, to our once great civilisation. <br>
It speaks for the strength and value of this civilisation that it has taken several generations to bring it to the brink. I appreciate your comment though, it is an eye opener.  <br>
Thank you. </p>

Her comments are quite surprising nevertheless, because they contradict what I see here in my library: that Asians are quiet and bland.

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with you more.  I&rsquo;m sick of these white kids wasting their minds on worthless degrees.  Their parents have no desire to push them because it might stunt their &#8220;self esteem.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was an accounting major in college and we used to laugh at the ones who couldn&rsquo;t hack the rigor and changed their majors to marketing or management.</p>
<p>On another note, there was a time where an open and blunt comment like that would incite someone to double down and try everything you could to beat the person just to show them what you&rsquo;re made of.  I know when I was in Advanced ADP, we were talking with our Chinese Professor right before the final exam about where he was going to work the next year.  He said he had accepted a job as the head of an Accounting PhD program at a (unnamed) university that required a 640 GMAT to get into the program.  Well, sure enough, one of the Chinese girls standing around, right in front of everybody just blurted out, &#8220;no American student could do that.&#8221;  I was so infuriated by not only the nature of her comment but also by her in-your-face attitude and even less concern how I felt about it, that I determined the only way to get even was to tear open the books, study my freaking face off for the final, and let my test results be my response - no whining, no complaining, and certainly no insults or death threats - but measureable results.  The result?  The professor told me after the test that I made a 100% and beat everybody in the class, all but 2 of whom were Asian.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t run down the hallway shouting and screaming &#8220;yeah, check it out!&#8221;  I didn&rsquo;t go seek out that girl and shove it back in her face.  I just internalized it as a proud personal moment and moved on.</p>
<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s just me.  But if that same person said that same thing to a college kid today, they wouldn&rsquo;t even have the mind set to even care.  I think kids today are beyond intellectual motivation.<br>

<p>Yes indeed, let this thing make a lot of steam and draw a lot of attention. Sorry Japanese 35,  looks like both sides had their young smelling less than a rose. I think the girl had a point. The Asians ought to apologize for being inconsiderate of other students. The girl needs to apologize,&hellip;Oh, I think she did already. Well, tell your kids to be quiet in the library.</p>
<p>On a serious note, a badly concealed attitude of superiority is shining through the scratch in the lacquer. Can&rsquo;t help but notice. I am glad I have some Japanese friends, I do not like to get in a bad attitude. <br>

<p>My experience is that recent immigrants from China &amp; India (in Silicon Valley) have less trouble talking on their phones in the restroom than folks born here (many of which are also of Chinese or Indian descent).</p>
<p>Bottom line is that the library staff isn&rsquo;t doing it&rsquo;s job (no&hellip; not banning the &#8220;Asians&#8221;) but telling folks to keep quiet in the library, regardless of their ethnicity.</p>

I remember one time at the post office I was standing in line and these asians (Vietnamese maybe?) were standing right behind me, however they were standing so close to me that it was very uncomfortable. No one else would stand that closely behind someone in a line.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that inside asian markets asians will often get very close behind another shopper with their cart almost hitting them, they sometimes drive the same way. Perhaps asians are used to being in crowded spaces in their home countries or having to shop or drive aggressively?</p>
<p>I empathize with this beautiful young white girl. I applaud her for having the courage to express her views and experiences in spite of the politically current thought police. I only hope that as she gains more life experience she will come to understand that the problem is far deeper than she could imagine right now. </p>

<p>Nonsense. If you Asians are so great, then why do Whites in America or elsewhere create the most inventions? Why are you  Asians over here studying at OUR universities such as MIT. If you are so brilliant, you&rsquo;d go to your own universities. Anyways, we Americans are not jealous, we resent large numbers of foreigners taking up space in American universities and jobs that should go to our own people, of course again, you hypocritical Asians don&rsquo;t allow  foreigners to take your jobs and university spaces but I have to blame the universities and our government for allowing that.<br>

<p>Lets grant that what you say is true that Americans can&rsquo;t hack it compared to Asians. Why would we turn the country over to you ultra-wise foreigners? What&rsquo;s wrong with looking out for yourselves? And MIT Nipponese look up your history, the USA was doing mighty fine without you. </p>
<p>It really is sad the ultra-rapid transformation of America. Twenty-five years ago California was mostly white, the diversities were black and so-called Chicano with yes a smattering of Asians many of which have been here since the mid-1800s. Queens,New York and New York City in general was the same. To me 1986 was not a long time ago but now we&rsquo;ve been so blessed with a wholesale onslaught of Multicultural Diversity Demographic change coupled with at the same time whites being emasculated and stripped of their rights relative to these, in effect, invaders. <br>
It is very scary to ponder what it will be like in 2036. All because the 1950s were so boring? Thank you Celler, Hart, and Kennedy.</p>

&#8220;If she were black, this would have been considered harmless commentary or better yet, there would have been an investigation into why all the Asians are stopping the black kids from studying.  That being said, black behavior is the real yardstick of obnoxiousness, and the girl should be happy that most blacks never get into the UC system. Generally, if you ask an Asian to follow rules he will. Ask a black, and he&rsquo;ll threaten to kill you if not assault you on the spot, then threaten to kill the library personnel, then threaten the security guard, then hoot and holler at the campus police as they cuff him and haul him away&hellip;</p>
<p>What exactly are you as a white person willing to give up to accommodate a very rapidly growing population of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites? Do you want to be a racial minority in an &ldquo;America&rdquo; with a billion people - mostly nonwhite - with massive population growth with no end in sight?

<p>Seriously, I hope that some white advocate could contact her or her parents and give them some encouragement.  She probably has no idea why this is happening.  She and her family probably don&rsquo;t understand because they&rsquo;ve been advocates of diversity and tolerance all thier lives.  Someone should contact them. </p>

		<p>&#8220;If you Asians are so great, then why do Whites in America or elsewhere create the most inventions? &#8220;</p>
<p>Who is to say that those white people who invented those things were not influenced by Asians in some way?</p>
<p>A lot of things are invented and researched by Asians these days, but I am sure you would not know about any of them because you selectively choose only to pay attention to the inventions of whites. If you were to visit any prestigious university these days and asked for a list of people who have contributed to the invention or research of a particular item, you would see that there would not be one, but probably several people of various races who were involved in that research. The Calabi-Yau manifold is a rather important discovery of the 20th century, and it was a Jew and an Asian that invented it. I&rsquo;m sure you would know nothing about that though since apparently white people are the only people who are intellectually capable of inventing important things, and if 1 white person is so smart, then ALL other white people must be just as smart and are automatically superior.</p>

<p>I tip my hat to you, Sir.</p>
<p>What is happening, right now, in Japan is terrible, and I offer to you my deepest condolences, and I understand your frustration as well.</p>
<p>Much like in the video posted by Miss Wallace.  We can often offer a rebuttal that is easily just as acerbic, angry, and vindictive, as the original offense.  That may explain the response of negative commentaries in response to your posting.  This oscillatory bickering appears to be never ending, which<br>
unfortunately may explain why racism is so vigorous and vociferous today   &mdash;   a sad testament to humanity, as a whole.</p>
<p>There are several more points and theories I would like to share:</p>
<p>1.  The University of California Police Department neither confirms nor denies that any of the threats were, in fact, death threats.  This sounds like UCPD believes that her claim of death threats may have been exaggerated.</p>
<p>2.  Toward the end of Miss Wallace&rsquo;s video tirade, she does somewhat equivocate by suggesting that anyone else (of non-Asian persuasion) also should not be using cellular telephones in the library.  If we can be generous (and as people of Science and Engineering, we can), we can offer Miss Wallace the benefit of the doubt and agree that Miss Wallace made some attempt to address all users of cellular telephones.</p>
<p>3.  There was an attempt to remove Miss Wallace&rsquo;s infamous video several hours after the original posting.  This may indicate that Miss Wallace had an epiphany regarding the negative consequences of her video (an epiphany nurtured with a little help from her Asian friends).  Unfortunately for Miss Wallace, the video had already been massively distributed (&#8220;gone viral&#8221;).</p>
<p>4.  Miss Wallace&rsquo;s initial impulse to make such a video may have been induced by the pressure of final exams as well as by natural forces (such as experiencing an inconvenient menstrual).</p>
<p>At this point, after much reflection on the matter, I can say that I may actually feel sorry for Miss Wallace.  Clearly, she is  on a campus of a different kind of majority.</p>
<p>Personal note: if I ever see Miss Wallace, I will buy her a sandwich (my way of extending an Olive Branch).</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

		<p>While she does come across as a dumbed down dolt at times in how she speaks,  the young lady made a valid point. Asians and many foreigners come here and act incredibly rudely  and contemptuously here towards us. God I despise many Muslims for that reason, they treat people here as though they do not exist, and many Asians are even worse in that regard. I have witnessed this behavior many times, it is a good thing for some of them that I do not understand what they are saying because I would parrot it back at them. I give these rude and garrulous on the mobile phone Asians an utterly cold glare, and to some of them the sight of gray eyes locked onto them like a cannon locked onto a target lets them know how angry I am getting towards them. Many Slavs like myself do not have high opinions of Asians, and this is one reason why. It&rsquo;s not good manners here to loudly talk into cell phones at libraries, restaurants or many other public places. The fact that threats have been made against her life is a very disturbing sign that whites are going to have to take back their lands by killing these invaders or driving them out. It&rsquo;s time for whites to start asserting themselves forcefully, and by force if necessary. At least she had the guts to object to their behavior publicly. I for one hate them more and more with each passing day and each passing affront they commit against me or my people. They have no right to come here and act like the conquering Mongols towards us. UCLA is one of the most anti-white universities there is, and had I posted a video, I would have used much more blunt, to the point language and I would not make any apologies. She should either, but she should have avoided that top she was wearing. She also could use some work on her presentation, but I admire her courage for making any sort of stand against our being pushed around in our own land. The fact she was threatened should be a wake up call to all whites that these foreigners in our midst not only regard us with contempt, they are enemies to be eliminated or driven out of our lands. Good for her for stating the truth, no matter how unpleasant it could become for her.</p>

		<p>sshadow,  The young lady shouldn,t have taken the bubble gummy happy approach to lecturing these inconsiderate immigrants, she should have taken on an attitude of cold icy hostility.  The implication should have been that if you come here from your less desireable country of origin, then you should be held to a higher standard of behavior than the sons and daughters of those who built this country, instead of the opposite. Whites need much more cohesiveness.  Now all other groups stomp on us because of their greater cohesiveness.  That&rsquo;s the only thing they have on us.   </p>

		<p>Cape to Cairo - Well said. I agree with you. Infact, your post is the only post worth replying to unlike the others who seem devoid of logical thought. Most white students ( blacks &amp; hispanics fare even worse) are simply incompetent as compared to some Asian groups and in a few decades America &amp; the west WILL be overtaken economically, technologically, militarily and socially by some Asian nations. </p>
<p>As for those keep ranting about white inventions, without the Chinese, Indians and Mesopotamians ( Asia) Europe would be nowhere in terms of science &amp; discoveries. We had our golden age thousands of years back, whilst the west had (& still has) it for the past 600 years. In a few decades, our golden era will return back to Asia. I personally have nothing against whites. Infact, I never criticized anyone by race. All I did was criticize the girl for acting like an imbecile which she proved herself to be by posting such an immature video befitting any highschooler leave alone an UCLA student.</p>
<p>P.S. As English is my second language, I don&rsquo;t expect my post to be error-free in terms of grammar. Thank you!</p>

		<p>#52- Indians, in general, do NOT have higher IQs.  Watch the Amren vid on IQ around the world.  India is in terrible shape.  <br>
About mocking accents, of course it isn&rsquo;t nice but don&rsquo;t kid yourself, everyone does this.  I went to Japan and a group of Japanese grade schoolers ran up to me and my White American friends and made noises which mock how Americans talk.  They laughed and laughed(so did we).  It is the nature of people, it is not exclusive to Whites.  <br>
If Orientals are so vastly superior, then why do they sneak into other countries and steal our downed planes and such?  To study our great inventions and to ride our coattails.  I appreciate other cultures but I have to draw a line when people come here and are ungrateful or act as people don&rsquo;t protect their cultures or mock differences in every country.  Lastly, it RUDE to come to a host country and bad mouth and disrepsect the natives who welcomed you and give you every opportunity.  Please learn manners.  I wouldn&rsquo;t dream of going to Japan and telling them they are dumb and lazy.  It&rsquo;s bad manners.</p>

<p>There are many Asians from overseas at the college I attend. Almost all of them have said that the reason why they attend school in the US is:<br>
#1- Because the Schools in their country are too difficult, and they can&rsquo;t pass the tests to get in. <br>
#2- Because the US gives them free financial aid for school tuition and books, and for living expenses; In other words the US pays them to go to school here.<br>
 <br>
I agree with one of the posters above that Asians cheat. They will do anything to get that diploma. To them (their family) a diploma means more than anything else. Once they get that piece of paper, they are considered smart even though they can&rsquo;t do anything. The bad part is that US companies hire them to boss whites around, and the Asians actually believe they are smarter than whites. </p>
<p>I also agree with another poster above that said the threats are most likely coming from white communist groups. ANTIFA, which is a fascists communists group claiming to be ANTI-FAscist, is the most likely candidate. These were the same groups of white-anti-white terrorists that were present at the &#8220;demonstrations&#8221; after the Johannes Mehserle trial.</p>

<p>The general consensus (including those opinions by popular psychiatrist, Dr. Drew Pinsky) was Charlie Sheen was in a troubled mental state, to put it kindly.</p>
<p>Later, I heard a broadcast on the radio that demonstrated that Charlie Sheen&rsquo;s maniacal speeches were actually scripted!</p>
<p>Scripted or not, look at all the publicity Charlie Sheen has.  He is on nearly one third of the magazine covers at the supermarket.</p>

<p>This is more nonsense and as far as your ranting on the greatness of Asia, Europe didn&rsquo;t look to Asia for inventions but did it on its&rsquo; own. Most of the modern world&rsquo;s inventions come out of Europe and have nothing to do with Asia.  As I said, if Asians were so great, then they would not come to the West to learn and get jobs in such great numbers. You wouldn&rsquo;t be at MIT. As far as you claiming you said nothing against Whites, yes you did. All the young lady in the video said was that Asians who come here should respect our culture and a lot don&rsquo;t, yet Asians wouldn&rsquo;t hestitate to criticize Americans in their country who didn&rsquo;t. Also, any new golden age was largely handed to much of Asia by greedy Whites embracing globalism and sending our jobs over there and our technology too.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of things are invented and researched by Asians these days, but I am sure you would not know about any of them because you selectively choose only to pay attention to the inventions of whites.

<p>Yes, I know Asians do invent and research things. A lot of these things have already been created by Whites and Asians just improve on them, however Asians do some of these things on their own. Again, go to any prestigious university these days, why do so many Asians have to come here to White created universities in Western lands, why don&rsquo;t they do this at home if they are so so great. I have nothing against Asians in their own country, but don&rsquo;t wish to have tons of them here taking over spots in universities that should go to our people. They don&rsquo;t allow us to do the same so why should we?</p>

<p>Why did the Cambodians let Angkor Wat go to waste. They believed it was created by gods and thought it was evil. It was originally part of (white) India. Cambodia and Khmer are Indian words. </p>
<p>What about the Tocharians? They were white. </p>
<p>The only reason why Asians appear very smart is because of the continual bashing of white males ( and to some extent white females), and the deliberate attempt to see that successful whites do not succeed.</p>
<p>If you give a White man a hammer, he will build a civilization. If you give an Asian man a hammer, he will make thousands of hammers just like it. If you give a black man a hammer, he will beat a white man with it and take his money.</p>

		<p>I can&rsquo;t believe this is even a discussion on here.  All of the white people reading about this should be on the same page here; we should all be in defense of this young lady, no ands ifs or buts about it.  Those of you who are wasting time apologizing for what this girl did, or writing posts kissing up to Asians, YOU ARE TRAITORS.  Pure and simple.  It is too late for this garbage. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that this girl can say whatever she wants on a Youtube video.  The fact that she is getting in trouble at all just shows how much diversity acts as a form of destruction for white civilization.</p>
<p>As for Japanese MIT fellow above, posts such as your&rsquo;s are what make white people angry.  Who are you to come here and tell us what we can and cannot accept?  Why don&rsquo;t Asians stay in their own countries and lecture us about it?  Wouldn&rsquo;t that make more sense?</p>
<p>As for the inventions argument, whether you like it or not, whites hold the monopoly on science and technology and always have with few exceptions.  I like how people like you enjoy reminding us about &#8220;the ancient civilization of Asia etc&hellip;&#8221; as if the achievements from that time and place even compare to what half of what Europe has done going back to the Greeks.</p>
<p>The world as we know it today (you know, the MODERN world), is a product of Europe.  If the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese etc&hellip; were as great as people say they are, then the world today would be reflecting something that THEY created.  But it does not, now does it?</p>
<p>I challenge anybody on here to open an Encyclopedia Britannica in the library.  Go to the article on the &#8220;history of science&#8221;.  Which group is most of the text devoted to?  It isn&rsquo;t Indians, arabs, or Chinese people.  It is Greeks, and then Europeans after the Renaissance.  There is a reason for this.</p>
<p>And I find it funny that you chose to mention Indians in your list of people smarter than whites.  Since when are Indians smarter than whites?  Ever been to India?  Why aren&rsquo;t you living there right now?</p>
<p>By the way, you might want to brush up on your Japanese history.  When it comes to copying from other civilizations etc&hellip;.the Japanese are the last people (out of the people in the world with high IQs) to be lecturing anybody on copying civilizations from everyone else from anywhere from China to the West.</p>

		<p>I am old enough to remember when Japan was picking up the pieces after the war, turning to the West and copying everything. We could not tour a West German factory as a student group, since they had canceled all such programmes because, as we were told, the Japanese were spying out everything they did. That is just how it was. The White male discovered/invented and the Asian copied, by stealth and by white generosity. Since they are a highly intelligent people, of course they have caught on and are on the forefront of progress at present. I think it behooves them though to knowledge the reality from whence their late success stems. </p>
<p> #81</p>
<p>Who is to say that those white people who invented those things were not influenced by Asians in some way?</p>
<p>In what way? some examples please. </p>
<p>I do not wish to disregard or diminish the great, ancient and venerable Asian cultures. Highly interesting. They have nothing to do with us.<br>
Our Western culture was built upon the foundation of Greece and Rome; I am sure you are aware of that. The so called &#8220;dark ages&#8221; presented a lengthy interruption, but  Western Culture did not start with the Renaissance. That, as the name implies, was a picking up and continuation of ancient ingenuity and greatness. </p>
<p>What is becoming of us and why? It is called &#8220;the sin of Balaam.&#8221;</p>
<p>We as a people have been good hearted, naive, and allowed ourselves to be led down the &#8220;primrose path of destruction.&#8221; A tragedy, no less. </p>
