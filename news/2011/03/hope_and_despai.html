<h1>Hope and Despair in New Jersey&rsquo;s Beleaguered City</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helen O&rsquo;Neill, San Francisco Chronicle, March 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The crackle of gunfire shattered the lunchtime chatter at Frank&rsquo;s Deli, as customers ducked and bullets flew across the street outside.</p>
<p>Three pierced the stained glass windows of the Sacred Heart church.</p>
<p>One plunged into Anjanea Williams&rsquo; abdomen.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Two days after one of America&rsquo;s poorest, most violent cities laid off half its police force, the chaos that is Camden had erupted once again.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>What good can rise from this bleak urban landscape of dilapidated row houses, where black-clad drug dealers sell brazenly on street corners, prostitutes just as brazenly sell themselves, and addicts rot in abandoned homes or stumble through a wasteland of vacant lots?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>There were many reasons for the city&rsquo;s decline: the loss of manufacturing jobs when factories and shipbuilding moved; the race riots of 1971 followed by white flight to the suburbs; the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s; the blatant corruption and mismanagement of local leaders (three former mayors went to jail).</p>
<p>But, as Wiggins [The Rev. Hayward Wiggins] points out, these things happened in other cities. What was it about Camden that made its collapse so swift and so stark?</p>
<p>The answer, he believes, is an utter lack of vision by its leaders. Even the state&rsquo;s much-heralded takeover of Camden in 2002 was a colossal failure in the eyes of many. Much of the $175 million allotted for improvements was funneled into tax-exempt institutions like Rutgers University and Cooper University Hospital, rather than the struggling neighborhoods.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The statistics are brutal: Camden has among the nation&rsquo;s highest unemployment, school dropout and homeless rates. The latest census data finds 53.6 percent of the city&rsquo;s residents in poverty, the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>Camden was the nation&rsquo;s second-most dangerous city based on 2009 data, and it held the top spot the two previous years, according to CQ Press. The FBI reported 2,380 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2009  &mdash;  more than five times the national average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On the other side of town, in an old row house on State Street, Bryan Morton says the same thing. The house once belonged to his grandmother and it is where he grew up, in a warm, noisy home filled with people, smells from the kitchen mingling with those from his grandmother&rsquo;s dining-room hair salon.</p>
<p>Morton, 40, and his wife Felisha, 21, want desperately to stay here, to raise their 2-year-old daughter, Isabella, and 7-year-old Nicholas, Morton&rsquo;s son from a previous marriage. But inevitably they have talked about leaving, not just for safety reasons but because Camden has so little to offer its children.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are almost taught not to dream in this community,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a refrain heard over and over by people who refuse to abandon the city that shaped them, the city they can&rsquo;t help but love.</p>
<p>Michael Hagan fled Camden after the 1971 riots  &mdash;  heartbroken, he says, after watching his city in flames.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cortes [Mary Cortes, who moved from Brooklyn 22 years ago because Camden was the one place she could afford to buy a house to raise her children] has always loved the community spirit of Cramer Hill, always felt safe there, always felt the city was on the verge of rebounding. But lately she has had her doubts.</p>
<p>In January, Mayor Dana Redd announced the layoffs of 167 police officers (this week she announced a plan to rehire 50 of them, at least through summer). The day of the layoffs, drug dealers were said to have paraded in a T-shirts emblazoned with the words &#8220;Now is Our Time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That gave me a chill,&#8221; Cortes says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My job,&#8221; he [Father Doyle] says, &#8220;is noticing and acknowledging miracles.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But for every miracle there are countless tales of despair.</p>
<p>After several daylight gunbattles outside her office, Helene Pierson, executive director of the Heart of Camden housing program, canceled a Saturday volunteer program, fearing for the safety of volunteers who rehabilitate abandoned buildings. For the first time, she also hired police to guard a concert at the church.</p>

		<p>This article would pretty much describe any place in the world controlled by Africans.  Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Haiti, the slums of Rio, Brazil, or the slums of Detroit, USA   &mdash;   anywhere on the planet Africans aggregate, you get the same results.  It is genetic.  </p>
<p>Africans everywhere know this, and this is why every African wants desperately to escape from other Africans and live safely among Whites.  The problem is, they bring these social pathologies with them. So they simply wind up destroying any White area they move to.</p>

		<p>     <i>Like poverty, it&rsquo;s hard to escape poetry in Camden&hellip;</i></p>
<p>I find that hard to believe, unless we&rsquo;re talking about rap lyrics.  </p>
<p>     <i>&#8220;In a dream I saw a city invincible,&#8221; is the boldest, drawn from the writings of one of Camden&rsquo;s most renowned residents, Walt Whitman&hellip;</i></p>
<p>How &#8220;renowned&#8221; is Walt Whitman amongst the current residents of Camden?  How many know who he is?  More importantly, how many blacks and hispanics care about long-dead white poets?  </p>
<p>How many current residents of Camden can even <i><b>read</b></i> that &#8220;inspirational&#8221; quote chiseled onto the building in better days?  </p>
<p>Liberals write hilariously thoughtless drivel.  If anyone runs into Helen O&rsquo;Neill, the author of this story, make sure to accuse her of the dreaded &#8220;white privilege&#8221;, then sit back and laugh while she squirms.  <br>

		<p> Ethnic or racial identification is carefully avoided in this story, with few exceptions. But, the photo of the march at the lead shows nothing but blacks. There is a mention of &#8220;White flight&#8221; after the 1971 riots. And those of us familiar with common black name patterns in the U.S. probably could guess who the writer is trying to shield.</p>
<p> Or, we could guess even more easily just by the fact that Camden is such a gosh-awful mess. When&rsquo;s the last time you heard of a mostly-White city that had gotten itself into such dire straits as Camden now faces? Read about the London of the 18th Century and you may notice similarities. But I think Caucasians have overcome such conditions as Camden faces, for the most part.</p>
<p> The names, faces, languages may change   &mdash;   Port-Au-Prince, Detroit, St. Louis   &mdash;   or Camden. But the inability of blacks to govern their passions, build stable families, succeed without massive help from &#8220;The Man&#8221; remains as a constant.  </p>

		<p>Why, with so many blacks and mexicans, Camden ought to be leading the world!  With so much diversity, with so many opportunites for the blacks to demonstrate their prowess.</p>
<p>Finally, whitey has gotten out of the way.  Now we will see what they can do.  </p>

		<p>Just watch any movie about South Africa, and you&rsquo;ll see that a city like Camden is already halfway to being another Jo&rsquo;burg.  Any city, county, or country eventually succumbs to chaos when populated and run by a large majority of blacks.  Crime runs rampant, and corruption cripples government.  </p>

<p>Hmm, I have an idea: create a &#8220;heat map&#8221; showing the crime rate of all urban areas of Camden&rsquo;s population size, and overlay it with another map showing the racial makeup of those same areas, and see if any patterns develop.</p>
<p>On second thought, forget it. That could lead to all kinds of uncomfortable &#8220;racist&#8221; conclusions.</p>

		<p>Cities grow, cities die.  One might wonder what is the question not being asked in Camden?  $175mm in state aid in addition to welfare and other social benefits can&rsquo;t stop the slide.  A crime rate 3x the national average.  The state has put in a beautiful aquarium and the Battleship New Jersey resides there, and still no improvement in the city.  And its not simply geography, as prosperous Philadelphia is a river width away.  Either the money is ill spent, or all the money in the world won&rsquo;t make a difference.  Perhaps some cities are meant to go under.</p>

		<p>Why is this even noteworthy?  Camden is overwhelmingly black and Hispanic.  Does anybody out there think it&rsquo;s supposed to be clean, prosperous, crime-free, and family-friendly.</p>

		<p>As an experiment, we could give every resident of Camden, NJ $500,000 and tell them to make their lives better. Liberals would blow a gasket because it would once and for all kill off the notion that we didn&rsquo;t do enough in the War on Poverty. <br>
Realistically, their behavior will not change and this would just fuel an incredible spending spree. I&rsquo;m sure the Cadillac Dealers, the places that sell Rims, and drug dealers would be in tall cotton! </p>
<p>Gary, Indiana elected their first black mayor in 1967, we all know how well that turned out. </p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Camden Wiggins remembers: a place of vitality and charm, a bustling city where jobs were plentiful at Campbell Soup Co., RCA Victor, Esterbrook pens and the shipyards. Downtown was alive with restaurants and theaters and stores. Kids rode their bikes to school and played in Whitman Park without worrying about tripping over needles or getting shot while buying lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Change a few of the details and this is the Gary, Indiana of my in-laws childhood and teenage years. However, they saw the writing on the wall and left before Hatcher was elected mayor. </p>
<p><br>
&#8220;The statistics are brutal: Camden has among the nation&rsquo;s highest unemployment, school dropout and homeless rates. The latest census data finds 53.6 percent of the city&rsquo;s residents in poverty, the highest in the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drive through parts of West Virginia sometime, they have a lot of poverty, but I have never felt like I was going to be carjacked there. </p>

		<p>The conundrum: poverty breeds crime (among certain peoples life reeds the crime), ignorance breeds poverty (some peoples can&rsquo;t learn, won&rsquo;t learn, won&rsquo;t change), sustaining lifestyles by government handouts breeds the very circumstance in question.</p>
<p>Good luck America, it will never change.  I agree with the post listing Camden as the garden center of the universe as a result of the diversity. Whitey is gone, the big oppressor is out of town, so now it&rsquo;s time to shine. </p>

<p>Actually, that experiment has already been conducted, using Black basketball and football stars.  What are the results of the experiment?  Well, exactly as Poster 12 (above) predicted: When Black athletes are showered with great accolades, respect, wealth and every imaginable type of opportunity, they still act like Black thugs.  It&rsquo;s not environment   &mdash;   it&rsquo;s genetic.  </p>

		<p>The San Francisco Chronicle often features articles like this one. A few years ago they had an article about homelessness and featured an intact family living in a van- they must have looked long and hard since the average homeless person is a single male with a substance or mental health problem. Poverty does not cause crime- many areas of Appalachia or other rural areas have poverty problems but nowhere near the crime rate of a Camden or Detroit. </p>

		<p>Imagine, for a moment, the unthinkable.  Imagine that every one of Camden&rsquo;s current residents were transported from the city, to brand-new Condos (maybe part of the $500,000.00 package other posters have suggested) elsewhere.</p>
<p>Properties in the now-vacant City of Camden would then be offered, at TWICE their current appraised value, to Whites only.  Sort of as a  Whiteness Quarantine, to insulate the innocent brown folk from the wickedness of Northwest Europeans.  The area would be fenced-off, and access restricted, for the protection of non-whites.</p>
<p>How quickly would every ramshackle property&hellip;every vacant lot&hellip; be snapped-up?  How quickly would the place start looking like a hybrid between one of San Francisco&rsquo;s gentrified Victorian districts, and a ritzy Suburb of London?  A community long ago planned for the Working Classes would quickly fill up with the Meritocracy of the surrounding Megalopolis.</p>
<p>A flyover would reveal swimming pools, Jacuzzis, Gazebos, Solar Panels, Solar Water Heaters (for the pools), Arbors, bright seasonal flags flapping in the river breeze&hellip; I&rsquo;d give it five years before the new plantings became established, and the townscape was ablaze with Wisteria, Roses&hellip;Lemons and Hibiscus in big pots&hellip; Window boxes spilling over with Petunias, Cannas, and Plumbago.  New Jersey&rsquo;s wonderful growing conditions, and the riverside microclimate would be exploited to the max.  People out walking would stop to drink in some wonderful fragrance: &#8220;Is that a Meyer Lemon I smell?  Or are you growing JASMINE this far North?&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d see blonde ponytails bouncing as joggers plied the streets (some jogging behind the wheeled velocipedes of their babies).  Glistening new bicycles&hellip;even whole bike clubs. Happy Seniors swapping plants, and leaning over picket fences to admire some stunning blossom in someone&rsquo;s garden&hellip; The Handicapped making their way SAFELY along well-maintained sidewalks.</p>
<p>Camden&rsquo;s once-admired tree-lined streets would be replanted and verdant: a beautifully laid-out city, once-again functioning as it was intended to, by its planners.</p>
<p>But, of course, I am thinking the unthinkable.  Why did we allow this sort of thing to become unthinkable?</p>

<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t he be arrested for child/sex, as some kind of sexual predator, Instead of being featured here as a hero of the city? If a white 38 year old man got a 18 year old girl pregnant he probably would be arrested. If it was a black girl, he&rsquo;d possibly killed, by others of these same spiritual and in tune inner city residence.</p>
