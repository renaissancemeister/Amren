			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Monica Scott, Grand Rapids Press, March 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The state has cited Grand Rapids Public Schools for suspending a &#8220;significantly disproportionate&#8221; number of black and special education students  &mdash;  a move that has forced the district to shift $1 million in federal funds to address the problem.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Superintendent Bernard Taylor] said the district is under sanction by the state Education Department requiring it to redirect $1 million in special education funds into general education &#8220;to deal with the over suspension of special education students and African American males.&#8221;</p>
<p>The state monitored Grand Rapids for rates of suspension and expulsion greater than 10 days for black students with disabilities, and for all students with disabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were selected for monitoring because the data reported by GRPS indicated a significant discrepancy in the rate of suspensions for all students with disabilities as well as African American students with disabilities,&#8221; the state reported.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report, which reviewed 2008-09 data, revealed that out of 268 special education suspensions/expulsions, 186 were black, 34 Hispanic, 29 white, 18 multi-ethnic and 1 Asian. Ottawa Hills had the most of the high schools with 22, all black students.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The state says this is not a financial sanction, but a requirement that more special education funds be used for programs to prevent high rates of suspension and expulsion.</p>

		<p>I am not surprised at either category getting suspended at higher rates. Kids with obvious behavior problems are being labeled as &#8220;special education&#8221; when 30 years ago they would have gotten the correct lable of &#8220;behavior problem&#8221; and summarily suspended or eventually expelled. Kids who are in classes that are over their heads will start to act out and misbehave so that nobody else in the class will get anything out of it. I have also noticed that the classes that lower achieving kids would frequent such as automotive repair or metal shop have been eliminated- now high achieving classes are getting cut as well. Kids are now being forced together in dumbed down classes where the smart kids are bored and the dumb kids act out. I guess to make it all fair they should suspend the white and Asian kids for chewing gum or being one minute late to class.</p>

		<p>This one&rsquo;s far too easy to respond to, but I&rsquo;ll do it anyway:</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t they bother checking whether or not blacks had been doing things that merited suspension to the same percentage?</p>

		<p>Could it be that these &#8220;disparities&#8221; (a civil-rights lawyer word) are the result of blacks engaging in the kinds of behavior that merits suspension and expulsion? </p>

		<p>Look, there&rsquo;s a simple formula to follow for any white person who wants to keep their job, whether a teacher, school admin or even cop: pretend everything is okay and let the blacks do as they please.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at, many teachers have learned this.  If you try to enforce white standards on non-whites, YOU will be called on the rug and questioned.  If it happens too much, they will rate you as &#8216;ineffective&rsquo; and toss you out with the trash.  </p>
<p>When you report problems, it makes the admins look bad on the statistics charts.  They don&rsquo;t want their bosses on their case.</p>
<p>The admins rarely back you up if it&rsquo;s a black student and a white teacher, especially if your admin is black, from the &#8216;tribe,&rsquo; or a social justice-minded female.  Fuggedaboutit!  I have seen this time and time again, although I have seen that latino admins have no problem disciplining black students.  Go figure.  I guess it&rsquo;s because they are untouchable and made of gold too.  (Look how Rhee got away with firing hundreds of black teachers because she was non-white.)</p>
<p>Lay low, let them run amok.  Report nothing of their wild antics.  As long as they are not doing anyone bodily harm, any action you take to keep them in their seat, do their homework etc is futile.</p>

<p>So the district has to spend an even greater disproportionate amount of funds on students who should not even be in public schools anyway. And what kind of programs do they think are going to help? Anyone who has ever worked at, known someone who worked at, or dropped their kids off at a school with &#8220;disabled&#8221; students will tell you that those kids are disproportionately troublemakers. And I don&rsquo;t know if it is like this everywhere but in the district my sister teaches in, all of the &#8220;disabled&#8221; children are in the regular classroom but have an additional personal teacher (they don&rsquo;t get paid as much as the regular teacher but they are full-time employees with benefits, etc). And as far as the black students, we don&rsquo;t need to say anything at all. </p>

		<p>There comes a time when sane people have to look at a hopeless cause, and instead of fighting it or trying to fix it or even denying it, just render it irrelevant.  If you have the money, you send them to a private school, and if not, you homeschool.</p>
<p>My sister home schools all 3 of her kids, and they are the most well-behaved, articulate, intelligent kids anyone could ask for as nephews and nieces.  Needless to say, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of &#8220;initiatives&#8221; or &#8220;sanctions&#8221; or &#8220;outreach&#8221; programs she has to waste her time on.</p>

		<p>Clearly a message is being sent to teachers and administrators.  Do NOT punish blacks for rowdy behavior, violence, inattention, or other disruptive behavior, else we will punish you.  Once this message is universally understood, public schools will be even greater hell holes than they are.  One more reason to home school, or send your kids to a restrictive private school.  The education Marxists and socialist judges will not be happy until every public school is a reflection of Detroit.  My question is, as more and more white and asian parents are required to pull their kids from public schools so the kids can get some kind of decent education in a safe environment, WHEN will we taxpayers be able to sue and stop paying public school taxes?  And at what point do we tell the activist judges to just shove it and go on with our rational business, ignoring them?  </p>

		<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s ever been in school with blacks knows that it&rsquo;s ALWAYS them who first break out the cellphones (for texting) in class, sneaking in rap music, or whispering about last night&rsquo;s sports game in the back of the classroom.</p>

		<p>I think more and more parents are coming to their senses about schools and seeing that most of them are hardly more than just holding pens. I think any parent who allows their child to attend a school that is more than 5% minority is doing their child a great disservice- not only are the academics dumbed down so that the minorities will have a chance to pass after about 3rd grade the behavior of said minorities will be so atrocious that any real learning will stop. Since it is now illegal to separate kids by ability a high level white child (or minority) will be at a distinct disadvantage. The only real options for most families would be to either get their kids into a good private school or home school. If you are in a larger urban area you could check out any charter schools that might be availible. With either charter or private schools a bit of a warning is needed- much of the academic silliness that ends up in public schools is sometimes started in private schools so investigate class room materials closely before enrolling your kids. </p>

		<p>Being in a classroom packed with black students is my idea of Hell.<br>
Bring back tracking, and spend as much money/time/resources on the gifted and talented students as we currently do on the minorities who are more trouble than they are worth (also hand-pick the g/t teachers!).  Or, homeschool. </p>

		<p>Related news:  Every city has one   &mdash;   A publication by blacks for blacks about blacks, mainly about black crime, and mostly in a tabloid-ish, semi-sensational (if not wholly sensational) writing style.  St. Louis&rsquo;s is called the &#8220;Evening Whirl.&#8221;  </p>
<p>I was filling my tank this morning at a station that just happened to have them for sale, and I noticed in the paper&rsquo;s upper right front page corner, they have something called an &#8220;achiever of the week.&#8221;  This week&rsquo;s achiever is a 15-year old Freshman at one of those St. Louis City high schools that are too cool to be named &#8220;school,&#8221; in this case, the &#8220;Career Academy.&#8221; </p>
<p>The young man, last name Bush, and a gentleman of color, has a perfect 4.0 GPA thus far in his high school career, and won a $100 prize, either sponsored by the school or the district or some combination of those and private money.  The prize was for never having been suspended from school.</p>
<p>Where was this when I was going to school?  And why do we pay students for not being suspended?  I thought not engaging in the kind of behavior that gets one suspended was a minimum expectation, not an achievement worthy of a cash reward.</p>
<p>While Mr. Bush is probably smarter than the average bear, so to speak, I doubt getting a 4.0 in Freshman courses at that school is really that difficult. </p>

		<p>I graduated from a neighboring district recently, and the scary part is where all of these &#8220;special ed&#8221; kids get to go. My old school epitomizes diversity, which may be why it has the tightest security of any suburban school. Although I must say, if I did not have to see what I saw, I may still be buying into the cult of diversity. </p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a school that&rsquo;s only 30 percent white and IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE with a far better track record than most all-white schools. <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_17606226?source=rss" rel="nofollow">https://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_17606226?source=rss</a></p>

<p>I hate it that your posts keep getting published.</p>
<p>You repeat the same mantra constantly:  Asians are superior to Whites. </p>
<p>Then why are your countries such a mess?  Why do you risk life and limb to live amongst us Stupid Whites?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a suggestion:  Stay in your own country and deal with the mess your own people created for you!</p>
<p>This country was created by Whites for Whites, not for Asians or Asian Indians.</p>
