<h1><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/black-thor-actor-blasts-debate-164048">Black &#8216;Thor&rsquo; Actor Blasts Debate over His Casting</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Pamela McClintock and Tim Appelo, Hollywood Reporter, March 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When Kenneth Branagh cast Idris Elba as Heimdall in the upcoming summer tentpole Thor, a furious debate erupted among fanboys, with some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god.</p>
<p>But the London-born actor has no patience for the debate. &#8220;It&rsquo;s so ridiculous,&#8221; he said Feb. 24 at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a man [Thor] who has a flying hammer and wears horns on his head. And yet me being an actor of African descent playing a Norse god is unbelievable? I mean, Cleopatra was played by Elizabeth Taylor, and Gandhi was played by Ben Kingsley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond that artistic defense, though, there is an even more basic reason black actors welcome colorblind casting: There is a ceiling on the amount of business black-themed movies can achieve, so the opportunities for black actors and actresses remain limited unless they can also claim parts in mainstream entertainment.</p>
<p>Black-themed movies have established a niche where they can do significant business at the domestic box office, but because they don&rsquo;t travel well overseas, there&rsquo;s a limited number of them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But even though they can turn to such genre films for employment, black actors have been losing ground. In the early 2000s, blacks played 15% of roles in film and TV. Today, it has fallen to 13%, according to SAG. And black directors make up only 4% of the DGA.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Academy Awards offered a stark reminder of the lack of diversity in the movie business; the nominees, both above and below the line, were almost uniformly white. And though 13 black actors have won Oscars in the ceremomy&rsquo;s 83-year history, only two directors have been nominated: John Singleton for 1991&rsquo;s Boyz N the Hood and Lee Daniels last year for Precious.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For while Hollywood knows the market for black films is circumscribed, it also realizes that black audiences can boost grosses on movies aimed at wider audiences. Studios rely heavily on black moviegoers to turn out for their mainstream films. Blacks, who represent 13% of the U.S. population, buy 12% of all movie tickets, according to the latest statistics from the MPAA.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most say Hollywood needs to do a better job if it is to reduce the glaring disparity in terms of the number of blacks onscreen and behind the camera.</p>

		<p>I only read a few Thors during my childhood 30 years ago. The story alone will pack theaters, but if word gets out that the worst thing about this film was the miscasting of Heimdall, at least it might deter them from another PC casting.</p>

		<p>Let them cast a white actor in a black part and watch the blacks scream racism and you can&rsquo;t do that cause the character is black not white.  No black has any place playing a Norse God.  It&rsquo;s an insult to white culture.  I for one will never go see this filthy movie.  And maybe if more so-called actors who are black could actually ACT they&rsquo;d get more and better parts.  However when a character is white there is no way a black should be cast, it ruins the whole movie.</p>

		<p>This is what I find confusing.</p>
<p>Say you are a White Person, Asian Person, Hispanic Person how did it ever come about that (blacks) are owed a taste of what others have created. If an Asian wants to have ALL Asians working in his store who has the right to tell him NO, lets see a few blacks on the payroll? In my mind No One Should, but it seems that they do?</p>
<p>Do blacks EVER do ANYTHING on their own or is their only skill<br>
in ripping a piece off what someone else has built?</p>
<p>Have we lost our minds here in America?<br>
Non blacks are still in control of their country BUT everyday they give more and more away to the undeserving.<br>
When will these (blacks) in particular be told enough is enough DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING ON YOUR OWN .. Stop being Affirmative Action leaches, it&rsquo;s unmanly ..</p>

		<p>Actually, here in the US blacks are grossly over-represented, relative to their numbers, in management, authority, leadership, and appearance-of-wealth roles on stage and screen.</p>
<p>One hardly needs to conduct a scientific survey to be aware of this. Simply note the preponderance of blacks in leadership, high-ranking military, congressional, and general authority figure roles in contempory cinema and TV. The numbers are wildly out of proportion to reality.  </p>

		<p>Kenneth Branaugh, though he has made more than one excellent film, is the very archetype of a Hollywood limousine liberal, and so it would be unreasonable to expect anything more thoughtful from him  &mdash;  or the <i>Hollywood Reporter.<i></i></i></p>
<p>But since he&rsquo;s so very, very committed to &#8220;colorblind casting,&#8221; I suppose we can any day expect to hear that he&rsquo;s directing the <i>Martin Luther King Story</i>&hellip;starring Jack Black.</p>
<p>PS: Cleopatra was Greek (sorry, all you hard-working afrocentrists, but there is simply <i>no</i> hard evidence that she had any black African genes).  And Ben Kingsley (better known to his parents as Krishna Pandit Bhanji) is half-Indian.</p>

		<p>Color blind casting, yeah right. The movie makers deliberately chose a black guy to play Heimdahl since that character is a supporting one. They would never dream of casting a black man to play Thor, Odin or Loki. In fact those roles have been filled by actors, I think in most people minds look like those Gods. Thor is being portrayed by a muscular blonde haired, white guy and Loki also by a white guy, only in this case it&rsquo;s a skinny, creeping looking guy, with glinsy, black hair. But because Heimdahl is a supporting character in this context, they think that they cast a non-white actor, so the movie can have its token black guy. </p>
<p>I hope my english wasn&rsquo;t too bad but to make things better, I have great news from Denmark. Today Denmark got a new minister of integration, and he promises to be really tough on multiculturalism and political correctness. I know he&rsquo;s a good guy.<br>

<i>&#8220;I mean, Cleopatra was played by Elizabeth Taylor, and Gandhi was played by Ben Kingsley.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Cleopatra was Macedonian Greek and Ben Kingsley physically looks like Gandhi, including general skin color. No one would have accepted a black man playing Gandhi and it would have been rightly ridiculed. Kingsley may not be Indian but with just a little make up, he fit the bill.</p>
<p><i>There is a ceiling on the amount of business black-themed movies can achieve, so the opportunities for black actors and actresses remain limited unless they can also claim parts in mainstream entertainment.</i></p>
<p>I say this every time this issue comes up. There is no &#8216;racist&rsquo; conspiracy to keep blacks out of Hollywood films; there simply isn&rsquo;t the market that blacks tells us there is.</p>
<p>There are few black films that make a profit large enough to make them worth the time and money. The Color Purple may have been a success but how many other black dominated films have ever achieved this status?</p>
<p>Hollywood is a business. That&rsquo;s why they call it the entrainment BUSINESS. It&rsquo;s about making a profit. There is simply no market for black dominated films.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why you see the black judge, the black best friend, the black co-worker, the black wisecracker. Bit parts. Just bit parts.</p>
<p>If blacks want black films, let them put their investment money where their mouth is. It&rsquo;s telling that with all the millionaire rappers, not one that I know of has ventured into the film industry. They&rsquo;re savvy enough to know there isn&rsquo;t any money in it. Most put their money into urban fashion. Blacks may not be a force to support films but they do like their urban wear.</p>

		<p>Within the article it says that black acting roles have fallen to 13 percent, equal to their proportion of the population. </p>
<p>The problem is that black stereotypes are true: blacks are over-represented with people who want to do singing, dancing, and games involving a ball.  </p>
<p>Too many working age blacks want to make a living as entertainers.  In order to satisfy them, whites and other races would have to step aside, something that blacks always assume will happen. </p>

<p>This means they buy movie tickets about on par with their proportion of the population.  How is that &#8220;relying heavily?&#8221;  </p>
<p><i>For while Hollywood knows the market for black films is circumscribed, it also realizes that black audiences can boost grosses on movies aimed at wider audiences.</i></p>
<p>But then the black audiences misbehave and drive away whites from the movie houses, thereby reducing the box office gross revenue for these movies.</p>

<p>I wonder if this African will wear make up to also make himself look like the ethnicity that he is depicting? Of course not.</p>
<p>I think the producers maybe cast this guy to deliberately off set the fact that this is a completely White themed tale. They&rsquo;ve created a buzz about their film and have become champions of &#8216;anti-racism. Win win for them, I just hope everyone just completely ignores everything about this project.</p>
<p>I imagined a casting agent&rsquo;s job would be, to looking to cast a potential actor into a charactor&rsquo;s mold i.e. a pre-determined &#8216;set&rsquo; ideal of that charactor. If there is no mold, what&rsquo;s the point of their job?<br>
You might as well just cast actors with a lottery type of system, could be amusing, it&rsquo;d show diversity for the joke that it is. </p>
<p>On a related note, I see that Will Smith and Jay-Z are producing a remake of the little orpahn Annie movie, you know the little red haired girl, Daddy Warbucks etc. Staring Smith&rsquo;s own daughter.<br>
<a href="https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118030526?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;nid=2562" rel="nofollow">https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118030526?categoryid=13&cs;=1&nid;=2562</a> <br>
Stealing/re-making White films such as &#8216;I am legend&rsquo;, &#8216;The Karate kid&rsquo;,&rsquo;the wild,wild West&rsquo; etc. has made Will Smith very rich. <br>
Proves that the general public sees nothing as being scared.</p>

		<p>So, blacks are in 13% (previously overrepresented at 15%) of movie and television roles, purchase 12% of movie tickets and are 13% of the population. Right?<br>
This seems exactly, perfectly fair to me. Or am I missing something here? <br>

		<p>Ever since Hollywood went hard left it hasn&rsquo;t been known for smarts when it comes to casting. After all they had a black girl play the part of sister to white brother Johnny Storm in the not-so-long-ago Fantastic Four movies, which ruined the shows for me. Remember when Sue met Ben&rsquo;s blind, black girlfriend for the first time; how they right away got down with some ghetto, hip-hop, girl talk? Johnny&rsquo;s sister? Yeah, right. </p>
<p>Will Thor&rsquo;s father, Odin, and his half brothers (Balder, Hermod, Tyr, Loki), be black? Or will they be white and the moviegoer will just have to assume that there must have been &#8220;one in the woodpile&#8221;? </p>
<p>It seems that there are just too many &#8220;Kenneth Branagh&#8221; types making films today, who don&rsquo;t understand that they maybe would have a classic on their hands if not for the miscasting.</p>
<p>Hey, Kenneth Branagh, you could make a MLK movie and cast Charlie Sheen (as MLK, of course), who, I understand, is looking for work at the moment.  </p>
<p>Hollywood just doesn&rsquo;t get it: Race matters in the movies. There&rsquo;s no market for black heroes, super or otherwise. The concept is way too incongruent. Yuck!</p>

		<p>Cleopatra was Greek and Ghandi, while not white, was a caucasion, thus the casting of Elizabeth Taylor and Ben Kingsley are not as off the wall as Idris Elba thinks.  The Norse gods may have been myths but they were Scandanavion myths and that should be respected.  Can you imgaine the uproar if Frederick Douglass were played by a non-black actor?</p>
<p>And why are black film such a niche product?  There are more blacks world-wide than whites, therefore black movies should be more profitable than white movies.  Don&rsquo;t Africans want to see Africans in movies?  Or do Africans not want to see black Americans in movies?  The problem is not with Hollywood the problem is with the worldwide black audience.</p>

		<p>Besides a few quote unquote non-whites being played by quote unquote Jewish actors the only thing more associated with Thor than his hammer is his long blonde hair.</p>
<p>I understand he is happy to have the job, but when Blade was made in to a movie there was no doubt that the actor was going to have to be black - because the Blade character is, and has always been black.</p>
<p>The MSM would have been all over the story if Christian Bale was chosen to play the Blade character.</p>
<p>The point is people need to keep level heads - this guy is reacting irrationally - Thor isn&rsquo;t some character in a comic book that was created a few years ago by some unemployed artist living in his moms basement - he has existed (not for me but for others) for generations, many hundreds of years - and he has never ever been depicted as being an African or black - THAT is the issue.</p>
<p>I get it, people are very sorry about racism - but this isn&rsquo;t about racism, it&rsquo;s about people wanting a damn distraction from their increasingly meaningless and boring lives by being offered a few hours of silence from all the meandering screaming from the social zealots and a black Thor doesn&rsquo;t do that, it does the exact opposite.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to see a white Blade, I don&rsquo;t want to see a black Thor.</p>
<p>Thank God the Lord of the Rings directors got it right and didn&rsquo;t insert multiculturalism where it wasn&rsquo;t wanted or needed.</p>
<p>At least we have THAT.</p>

		<p>Um&hellip;casting isn&rsquo;t &#8220;colorblind&#8221;. You would never see a white man cast as Martin Luther King, Anwar Sadat, Nelson Mandela, Robert Mugabe, or Idi Amin. Nor would you see a white man cast as an African deity.<br>
Casting a black guy as Heimdall (&#8220;the whitest of the gods&#8221;) is just an example of Hollywood casting black men in bizarrely anachronistic roles. Still, I suppose a black Heimdall makes about as much sense as a black computer hacker, so it&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s really precedent-setting.</p>

		<p> This is not the first time Kenneth Branagh has cast a black actor in a grossly inappropriate role: In his film version of &#8220;Much Ado About Nothing,&#8221; he has Denzel Washington playing an Italian nobleman. And no one in the movie bats an eye over the fact, or says, &#8220;Who&rsquo;s that Nubian and why is he dressed up like an Italian nobleman?&#8221;</p>
<p> Of course casting Idris Elba as a Nordic god is laughable. If it&rsquo;s OK for an actor of one race to play a character of another race, how come blacks always got so het up and &#8220;outraged&#8221; over various White actors, including Lord Laurence Olivier, portraying &#8220;Othello&#8221;? Looks like it depends on whose ox is being gored, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>Some of this &#8220;non traditional&#8221; casting is bizarre; some is just plain bad taste. A few examples. In the 1990s Wagner&rsquo;s Ring, in the opera &#8220;Siegfried&#8221;, the Germanic Princess Sieglinde was played by Jessye Norman, a good singer, but definitely non traditional for the role in which she leaves her white husband for the white guy Sigmund. In a recent &#8220;Rhinegold&#8221;, Alberich, a dwarf from the underworld, is played by some black guy; good singer, but visually jarring as he puts the moves on the (white) Rhinemaidens. On a more sinister note, we see in &#8220;The Flintstones&#8221; the temptress (to the married Fred Flintstone )part played by, if I recall correctly, Halle Berry, a Mullatto woman. This is the price we pay to gin up the numbers of minority players in the arts. </p>

		<p>Ben Kingsley is half Indian (look up his birth name).  Cleopatra was white, Macedonian Greek to be exact.  In times of Ptolemaic Egypt the Capital was Alexandria.  When Cleopatra was alive non-Greeks were BANNED from stepping foot in the city, even ethnic Egyptian locals (Romans got a free pass).</p>
<p>People argue that Brad Pitt should do a remake of MLK, but this is not the same and Liberals will shoot down that comment.</p>
<p>Instead say this:  I know you think it is not big deal, but it is.  I would say that non-blacks should play black fictional characters from history but they never learned to read or write so they do not have history.  So instead they are trying to steal mine and I don&rsquo;t like it.  </p>

<p>Everyone is going to jump on this one, I bet.  Someone ought to educate the black impersonator of a historical White God.  Cleopatra was Greek, of a Greek Egyptian dynasty, and therefore WHITE. Elizabeth Taylor as an Ashkenazi Jew is a perfect fit because she looks as Greek as she does Jewish - or White.  Ben Kingsley is &#8220;British&#8221; but he is not Anglo-Saxon, and he actually looks like Ghandi.  This &#8220;actor&#8221; is an idiot and so is &#8220;The Hollywood Reporter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason the number of movies with black actors has dwindled, is because black directors like Spike Lee only know how to make Afro-centric films, most of which insult whites, and that even blacks would rather see whites on screen than blacks.  On a practical point, dark skin isn&rsquo;t all that photogenic.</p>

		<p>Oh Lord.  I&rsquo;m sure half a dozen posters have already submitted comments stating that Cleopatra was Macedonian, i.e. European, and Ben Kingsley&rsquo;s father was Indian, but I&rsquo;ll chime in as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the early 2000s, blacks played 15% of roles in film and TV. Today, it has fallen to 13%, according to SAG.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black people are 13% of the population.  They are already cast in proportion to their numbers.  They&rsquo;re already overrepresented in the celebrity world, especially in music and sports.  So what&rsquo;s to complain about?</p>
<p>99% of actors are out of work at any given time.  What makes these special sepia snowflakes think they should have it any better than the rest?  What will satisfy them?  50% of roles?</p>
<p>&#8220;Blacks, who represent 13% of the U.S. population, buy 12% of all movie tickets, according to the latest statistics from the MPAA.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until black people buy a larger percentage of movie tickets, they have no business griping about representation.  I had to laugh when I read recently that Gabby Sidibe complained that she doesn&rsquo;t see herself in most Hollywood movies.  We can see the morbidly obese all around us for free.</p>
<p>Recently I watched the first episode of the new Starz adaptation of Camelot.  It was excellent.  However, when the Knights of the Round Table were introduced, the first one to appear on camera was a black dude.  Aren&rsquo;t they taking the &#8220;Black Knight&#8221; thing a bit too literally?</p>

		<p>Setting aside the lunacy of Afro-Nordic Gods&hellip;I have no idea from whence those alleged SAG statistics derive, but I am CERTAIN they are wildly misinformed!! One cannot turn on the television, nor watch a film that is not saturated in Black actors. The very notion that there are somehow not ENOUGH Blacks in film, TV, or anywhere in the entertainment industry is laughable and perhaps better stated, simply delusional! If I went by TV commercials alone, I would be convinced at this point that Blacks are more like 60% of America&rsquo;s population than 13%!!</p>

		<p>Most blacks have pushed the idea of making their ethnic group a very significantly noticeable minority.  Few have supported the notion of simply trying to blend into the majority and competing on their own merits.  Thus, little more than a handful of acting roles seems awarded to blacks without race playing at least some important factor in the choice.  Either leftist Hollywood is pushing its agenda, or a black audience is being sought.<br>
Now, the whole idea of injecting black actors in non-black roles has gone twilight zone.  Otherwise superb English drama, in particular, has been infested with over-the-top tokenism.  One would think that half the British population is black from the portrayal of so many white female/black male couples in contemporary productions.  Worse, the male is usually so stereotypically African-looking that one might believe it&rsquo;s the same actor in every role!  <br>
Hopefully, this black Norse god business will be the last straw for white audiences, who must be close to the end of their tether with this whole effort to push the leftist agenda down our throats.</p>

<p>As for the ignorant Idris Elba  and his weak argument:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a man [Thor] who has a flying hammer and wears horns on his head. And yet me being an actor of African descent playing a Norse god is unbelievable? I mean, Cleopatra was played by Elizabeth Taylor, and Gandhi was played by Ben Kingsley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleopatra was white.  Further, that the media has a dangerous power to brainwash the masses into thinking that Thor was black, if it sells at the theaters.  There are so many weak willed sheeple, that they simply buy into it.  Elba&rsquo;s own ignorance on Cleopatra&rsquo;s whiteness demonstrates this simple fact.  This postmodern pastiche of blurring cultural boundaries is indicative of Hollywood&rsquo;s pop-culture degeneracy suited for people can&rsquo;t think for themselves.<br>

Blacks everywhere are overjoyed.  &#8220;I can&rsquo;t imagine a better actor for the part&#8221; said Jessie Jackson.  &#8220;He will be an inspiration for all inner-city kids everywhere, because it is important to have role models who do not look like you,&#8221; said Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Some White Liberal Hollywood types have asked if it it might have been better to have a black person play Martin Luther King.  However, Idris Elba retorted angrily, &#8220;Race, sex, age, height, and sexual orientation have notching to do with acting. In fact, Elton John, Rue Paul, Lady Ga Ga, and Tammy Faye Bakker all would have been great for the role of the famous civil rights advocate. Diversity is our greatest strength.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The one that gets me the most has to be the black remake of the Honeymooners. Being a huge fan back in the day as a kid, the great one, Jackie Gleason and Art Carney must be rolling in their graves. These characters are simply irreplaceable. How in the world a bunch of Hollywood executives could even utter the thought of remaking this great classic with black actors with ghetto humor in a meeting is not only a crime but a disgrace to the original cast. There are some things that you just don&rsquo;t touch or remake, and this is one of them. Apparently they must have been the same execs that approved the  making of The Wiz (the black remake of the Wizard of Oz). Makes me sick just thinking about it again.</p>
<p>I have to admit though, Robert Downey Jr did an amazing job portraying a black man in Tropical Thunder&hellip;very, very believable. But then again, Robert is an amazing actor and his body of work has proven he can portray anybody&hellip;unlike any black acting talent I&rsquo;ve ever seen.<br>

		<p>1.  It&rsquo;s a comic book being treated as high art.  That says a lot more about us than blacks.  Most especially that young men, looking for warrior-symbols of their own male rite of passage are being slum-dogged by external ethnic influences in cheap stories told without the higher symbolisms.  A warrior in Norse culture was honored as a fighter but a farmer or a leader was respected more because dealing with the other 90% of life as a diplomat or landowner brought more material rewards and responsiblity.<br>
2.  &#8216;Shaka&rsquo; is an intestinal parasite which, in Shaka&rsquo;s case, caused the daddy to refuse to own up to a little too-deep fromage while escorting a big chief&rsquo;s daughter on a walk between camps (apparently the parasite can mess up menstruation).  7 months later, said father was told to come get his little Shaka, and refused to, giving Shaka a &#8216;complex&rsquo; he held for the rest of his life.  And the rest (genocide of other black tribes, butchery and betrayal of his own.  Suicide charges that caused immense losses in the tribal warriors.  Slicing open women&rsquo;s bellies to look at still living fetuses&hellip;) is history.<br>
3.  It&rsquo;s _moot_, not mute.  I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal but mute means soundless or without the ability to speak, look at your TV remote.  Moot mean without point or consequence as a fait accompli action.  We _are_ smarter than the blacks because we self-correct our mistakes.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Beyond that artistic defense, though, there is an even more basic reason black actors welcome colorblind casting: There is a ceiling on the amount of business black-themed movies can achieve, so the opportunities for black actors and actresses remain limited unless they can also claim parts in mainstream entertainment.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>No.  The reason blacks like leaching off of white roles is because there is no multi-thousand year black culture to derive their own hero worship from and they are so pathetic they would rather glom onto something alien than think up their own.</p>
<p>See Shaka Zulu above.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Black-themed movies have established a niche where they can do significant business at the domestic box office, but because they don&rsquo;t travel well overseas, there&rsquo;s a limited number of them.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which is the same thing as saying if a salesman aka casting agent brings in 100% of a given audience segment, he may add, not &#8216;12-15%&rsquo; but 100,000-500,000 _tickets_.  Which, at ten bucks a pop, is another 1-5 million dollars.  Suddenly not such a small deal in a market where the main audience group is &#8216;handled&rsquo; by an established A-list culturated elite.</p>
<p>Yes, Hollyweird is just as screwed up, class-as-cast consciously, as the rest of America.  They only pretend to be liberal so that they can continue to cut the best from the herd and not have anyone notice.<br>

		<p>  It is my understanding that all evidence indicates Cleopatra was Greek/Macedonian . She was a Ptomely, they practiced remaining pure . Ghandi was Indian . If you start looking up Aryan in archaic dictionaries, Indo-Europeans were the first to be defined under that term . I had wondered why Indians would sometimes post here claiming to be Aryan, now I know . So Ghandi defintely was not sub-Saharan African and I doubt seriously Cleopatra was . So I do not think Black Thor gets too many points for those two statements .</p>
<p>   What I would like to know, the character portrayed by Danny Glover in &#8220;Bat 21,&#8221; I assume he really existed, was he really white ? I like to keep up with this, I&rsquo;ve seen it several times in later movies . Plus, Glover really irked me with what he said about Georgians in the weekend magazine .

If Branagh had the sense to cast someone suitable for the part of Thor, such as Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, or even an unknown white actor with blond hair and blue eyes, not even blacks would have accused him of racism!&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; You&rsquo;re on it!  The real racist in this is Kenneth Branagh, who caste it as he has intentionally.  He thinks he is making a statement by having a black Thor.  And he thinks he is deconstructing &#8220;Whiteness&#8221; and doing the world a favor.</p>
<p>On the Arnold comments:  William Tell takes place during the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty, Holy Roman Empire period.  Switzerland was inside the Empire and so Arnold could have been William Tell.  But I think he would make a great Thor, even now.</p>

<p>At least we have THAT.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a long time LOTR fan (first read in &#8216;68), I would like to make these off main topic comments  (to any who may be interested) if I may;</p>
<p>1.  You&rsquo;re right, we can thank our lucky stars (not God), that Jackson caste LOTR movie correctly, but he did inject some feminism into it at a couple very important moments that injected some awkwardness into the flow of the film as well as affecting the main character &#8220;Aragorn.&#8221;  Using Arwen as the foil of feminism, Jackson replaced Legolas role in first locating him and the Hobbits making for Rivendell with her and she is depicted as sneaking up on a Ranger (Aragorn).  Tolkien&rsquo;s elves could do this, but Jackson has Arwen, put her (Samuri) sword to her great love&rsquo;s throat as a greeting, in a very &#8220;Zena&#8221; staggering style.  But that&rsquo;s not enough, she is asserted as the better rider, and better able to defend Frodo.  At the ford, she conjurs up the flood, usurping Elrond, her father&rsquo;s power.  Later in the films, when the Captain of the Ringwraiths faces Eowyn, she asserts her identity in an anti-male fashion.  Just one word and a hint of feminist arrogance ruins the scene.  In the real story, Eowyn is somewhat surprised when her foe claims that no man may slay him, &#8220;But, I am not a man.&#8221;  Compare that to Jackson&rsquo;s &#8220;I am NO MAN!&#8221;  The intent of Tolkien was that the Captain of the Nazgul would have a moment of hesitation as he wondered what that meant.  That was the moment Eowyn strikes.  Purist nonsense perhaps, but it ought to be noted that the Tolkien heirs rejected this film, greatly criticizing it story modifications.  IMO it is a great film for fans, but it could have been even better if some of these details were rendered more truly.  The Tom Bombadil and Barrow Downs chapters were absent altogether.</p>
<p>LOTR is a great literary work.  Tolkien, although a devout Catholic was careful to not make LOTR a Christian story, but one that reflected more on indigenous European spirituality and culture.  In the 1960s and &rsquo;70s, Christians condemned LOTR as Satanic, pagan, etc.  This was before they learned more about Tolkien and the actual story as a group.  In the way Christianity has of absorbing things they cannot change (Christian Rock (once totally Satanic), Christian Biker gangs, etc., LOTR came to be claimed as a Christian story.  Actually, Tolkien created a cosmology more like Judaism combined with Nordic pagan cultures.  But his claimed effort was as all his Oxford &#8220;Inkling&#8221; cronies were, to rekindle an appreciation of the values of the high medieval culture of Europe.  He did this without a Christian overlay, which was a great service to modern white culture because he created a vast, worldwide readership with a modern, white hero tale about loyality, love of one&rsquo;s land, one&rsquo;s people, and one&rsquo;s way of life, and the struggle between good and evil in general and inside ourselves.  </p>
<p>Even if they don&rsquo;t realize it, the millions and millions of readers have been influenced by Tolkien&rsquo;s very Nordic styled epic.  Overall, Jackson did contribute to this, exemplifying many folk virtues of white beauty, character, and culture in the film.  When the film came out, one local editorial railed against it as a film promoting white supremacy.  In the past, feminists have attacked Tolkien&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Tolkien was of German ancestry.  Tolkien hated Hitler and bemoaned very strongly, the damage done to the Nordic archetype by Hitler and the Nazis.  In Tolkien, we have a kind of spiritual guide for the future of the white race, if we are intelligent enough, and literate enough, to grasp it.</p>

<p>Heimdall is the brother of Sif, who should be a white goddess, and he became infatuated with Amora the Enchantress who is usually portrayed as one of the blondest of blonds. Not to mention Heimdall has one of the noblest of jobs in safe-guarding BiFrost, the bridge to Asgard.</p>
<p>They can have a field day with this character. A multi-racial family of gods(*somehow*)whose dark son is the guardian of their entire realm; so therefore deserves the love of the most beautiful woman in Asgard. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll make him Thor&rsquo;s best friend.</p>

<p>**One way they could write it is that Odin bred with an African woman on Earth, because blacks were the original man, and produced someone very much like a black..messiah&hellip;?</p>
