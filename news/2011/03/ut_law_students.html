			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>JC Reindl, Toledo Blade, March 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Law student Kyle Bristow spent last summer living and working in Toledo, {snip} at Lucas County Family Court Center, assisting low-income residents with their child-custody and divorce cases. He said he found the work fulfilling. A large number of clients were black and Hispanic.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But when he wasn&rsquo;t helping minority families, Mr. Bristow was writing a self-published novel that a national civil rights group deemed racist and &#8220;hate fiction.&#8221; It classified the novel as in the same genre as The Turner Diaries, a fantasy said to have inspired domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh, the 1995 Oklahoma City bomber.</p>
<p>Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s thriller, White Apocalypse, is set in northwest Ohio. He says it was inspired by his research into the Solutrean Hypothesis  &mdash;  a fringe theory of archaeology that suggests European settlers crossed a frozen Atlantic Ocean and beat the ancestors of present-day Native Americans by several thousand years. In Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s telling, these white settlers were massacred by the darker race that arrived later.</p>
<p>His book, which is dedicated to &#8220;the real Native Americans,&#8221; appeared last fall and was embraced by some admirers as a necessary white power book: &#8220;This evidence could be the jolt whites need to awaken from our suicidal slumber,&#8221; one reviewer wrote for the book&rsquo;s dust jacket.</p>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala., says the book, though fiction, really depicts the assassination of two of its staff members  &mdash;  a claim Mr. Bristow denies. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>A polarizing figure</b></p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>At 19, Mr. Bristow was elected chairman of MSU&rsquo;s Young Americans for Freedom chapter, a conservative group started in 1960 under the aegis of William F. Buckley, Jr. Mr. Bristow transformed the chapter into a lightning rod for controversy.</p>
<p>The chapter took some traditional conservative stances, such as opposing gay rights and amnesty for illegal immigrants. It invited mainstream conservative speakers to campus, including former Colorado Congressman Tom Tancredo. But the group also invited Nick Griffin, a British politician and Holocaust denier who has been accused of inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>Left-wing campus groups held protests against both the Young Americans for Freedom chapter and its most controversial speakers. Agitators pulled fire alarms to disrupt some events. Mr. Bristow said he was kicked and spat upon by protesters and that other chapter members&rsquo; vehicle tires were slashed.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Bristow, the group planned &#8220;Catch an Illegal Immigrant Day,&#8221; members said, to raise awareness of immigration, though it was canceled. The group held a &#8220;Koran desecration contest&#8221; and organized a &#8220;straight power&#8221; rally outside Lansing City Hall to protest an anti-discrimination ordinance that would protect gays and lesbians. The ordinance passed.</p>
<p>Mr. Bristow wrote a press release for the city hall protest: &#8220;YAF members find homosexuality and other forms of sexual deviancy to be disgusting. The Boy Scouts, military, and the American public need to be protected from these degenerates.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Hate group&rsquo; label</b></p>
<p>In 2007, the spring of Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s sophomore year, the Southern Poverty Law Center designated his Young Americans for Freedom chapter as one of 800 &#8220;hate groups&#8221; in the nation. {snip}</p>
<p>Compared to the activism of his college years, Mr. Bristow has all but gone underground at UT&rsquo;s law school.</p>
<p>Brad Levine, a friend and classmate, said Mr. Bristow is generally recognized on the law campus as being conservative, but he doesn&rsquo;t press his viewpoints. If he does stand out, it is for being very serious about his studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;His classroom demeanor is quite quiet. You hardly notice he&rsquo;s there half the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never seen him go out of his way to push any political beliefs on anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Levine, 29, is Jewish and considers his own political views liberal, &#8220;and yet I&rsquo;ve had no problem at all befriending Kyle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Political heroes</b></p>
<p>{snip} In person, the polite and demure student discussed his political heroes: Pat Buchanan, Ron Paul, and Barry Goldwater. He traced the development of his self-described conservative philosophy to his teenage years as a shy bookworm. He said his turning point came when reading noted conservative Ann Coulter&rsquo;s Treason :Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Just ripples now</b></p>
<p>Mr. Bristow said the rigors of law school have kept him too busy to get involved in activism at UT. But there have been a few ripples.</p>
<p>In April, the online &#8220;legal tabloid&#8221; Above the Law published two detailed blog posts about how Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s past at MSU raised concerns among classmates. The site said it was tipped off by UT law students, it did not name, who complained about his past.</p>
<p>The blog post said students became alarmed by writings on Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s Facebook profile, including a status update that said he was rooting for Duke in the NCAA tournament because it was the &#8220;last white basketball team.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Bristow downplayed the controversy and blamed it on a couple of left-wing students trying to discredit conservatives. He also accused the blog posts&rsquo; author, Elie Mystal, of having &#8220;a history of going after conservatives who are trying to become part of the legal profession.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>Controversial exit</b></p>
<p>Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s exit from his chairmanship of Young Americans for Freedom was a matter a controversy. He said he resigned near the end of his junior year because he needed to study for the Law School Admission Test. But current and past directors of the national organization say Mr. Bristow was forced out.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mr. Bristow said the Young Americans for Freedom claims are lies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>The book</b></p>
<p>The plot of <cite>White Apocalypse</cite> revolves around the fictional discovery of a mass grave of very early white settlers that would prove the Solutrean Hypothesis. Native Americans and liberal activists make every effort in the story to bury the evidence.</p>
<p>The narrator in the novel describes how one character&rsquo;s ancestors &#8220;for 40,000 years were all white and he hated who he was so very much that he put an end to that tradition by becoming romantically involved with a nonwhite individual  &mdash;  as many white liberals are predisposed to doing these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The book includes a graphic assassination scene outside a Toledo courthouse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Our security was much more worried about this, simply for the reason it was in the form of a book. That is the kind of thing that sits on a white supremacist&rsquo;s shelf for years,&#8221; Mr. Potok said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bristow said neither Mr. Potok nor the law center is depicted, and all the characters are made up. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve never even met the man, but he sure has a lot to say about me,&#8221; Mr. Bristow said. &#8220;I think he&rsquo;s grown an obsession with me that&rsquo;s kind of creepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Potok said he was more shocked by the novel&rsquo;s dust jacket than its story. Nearly a dozen individuals and public figures, including two college professors, heaped praise.</p>
<p><b>Other feedback</b></p>
<p>One contributor, James Edwards, an author and Memphis-based radio host, called the book &#8220;glowing with white pride and sorely needed these days, for European Americans are subjected to nonstop insult, abuse, and bashing.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As for the Solutrean Hypothesis, a small minority of researchers believe some European settlements in the eastern half of North America could have preceded the migration from Asia across the Bering Strait land bridge roughly 12,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Dennis Stanford, anthropologist and a curator at the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History, said there are a handful of archaeology sites on the East Coast that he believes show evidence of early Europeans. One possible reason for the settlers&rsquo; disappearance was &#8220;an absorption and reallocation of genes&#8221; when they met and mated with the ancestors of present-day Native Americans.</p>

		<p>This reporter is just another example of how ignorant those in today&rsquo;s biased journalism is.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve adapted political correctness so much they couldn&rsquo;t think in unbiased terms if they had to.</p>
<p>Citing the SPLC as an authentic objective organization is tacit proof of how stupid yellow journalists are now days.</p>

		<p>I have seen this book advertised, but have not read it. I have read &#8220;Camp of the Saints&#8221; and even &#8220;Turner Diaries.&#8221; I think what truly gives the Left fits about these books is that they are not poorly written. When you&rsquo;re talking about a novel, the litmus test should not be whether or not you agree with the author&rsquo;s political views, but whether or not the work is well-written.</p>
<p>To give an example. I frankly find Maya Angelou to be a racist bully, but she is a more than capable poet and playwright. As for this author, I would be more than a little skeptical of anyone whose intellectual awakening came after reading Anne Coulter.</p>

		<p>When I first read the header to this article I thought Mr. Bristow was a student at our, notoriously liberal, UT (University of Texas) Law School. I thought he would be expelled forthwith, or on the outside end up having to drop out because he&rsquo;d never pass another course no matter how well he did. I breathed a sigh of relief when I found out he was a student at the University of Toledo. U Texas has been waging a relentless war against &#8216;Whites&rsquo; and &#8216;White&rsquo; history for years. Last year a former Prof waged a campaign to have a dorm, named in honor of William Simkins, a legendary Prof at the law school and a Confederate hero renamed. Seems that Simkins had been a member of the reconstruction K. The Prof won. Another Prof, Sanford Levinson has demanded the removal of Confederate monuments from the Capital grounds.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work Kyle. America needs lawyers with a sense for a good cause. Pride in race and heritage.    </p>

		<p>This story sounds strangely like the Book of Mormon and it&rsquo;s tales of people from the Middle East traveling to North America and populating the continent only to be killed by Indians after several centuries. It is true that there were some early European settlement but not in huge numbers. </p>

		<p>Hmmmmm, I thought the reason the early American whites disappeared was because of a meteor hit on a Canadian ice sheet that caused a massive dustup and weather change about the time the last of the CONUS megafauna went extinct&hellip;</p>
<p>I guess if it&rsquo;s not murder, it&rsquo;s not sensational enough to be writeable.</p>
<p>In any case, the problem with pride-in-past as a justification for the present is that it still doesn&rsquo;t give you an assured right to a future.</p>

This is quite true, but who is doing the bashing?  Marxist Whites.  They are the enemy of the White race.  Blacks and mestizos are not the cause of White problems, they are but a symptom.  In the face of a racially conscious White civilization they would flee.  Our culture is being rotted from the inside out by the marxist cult.</p>

		<p>The Solutréen hypothesis is amusing :)<br/>
Indeed, the oldest artefacts in the Americas (more specifically, Clovis and Sandia spearpoints) are more easily explained by Europeans swimming across the Atlantic. They differ somewhat from European ones, but there is nothing even remotely comparable in North Asia.<br/>
But I fail to see the political significance of it, i.e. why is it so hotly contested? (I mean, apart from lefties seeing their &#8220;First Nations&#8221; rhetoric undermined)<br/>
Item, I fail to see why so many WNs so fervently dispute the &#8220;Out of Africa&#8221; theory. Humans evolved from blacks. So what? (Actually this is a bit more complicated, and due to new methods the field is in flux, but you get the point)</p>
<p>- As for the hapless author, I wish him the best of luck in his new career as a fiction writer. Law he can forget.</p>

		<p>I&#8221;d like to comment, as I&rsquo;ve researched (for a layman) the &#8216;Solutrean Hypothesis;&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ve read Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s book.</p>
<p>First off, the Discovery Channel did a fully-acted, hour long movie on this &#8216;fringe theory,&rsquo; years before Mr. Bristow had even heard of it. It was neo-NatSoc John de Nugent (calling him a &#8216;neo-nazi&rsquo; merely legitimizes his opponents-but de Nugent is on &#8216;that side of the fence,&rsquo; as it were) who brought it to the attention of a greater number of readers, and (I believe) it was this that caused Mr. Bristow to write the book. Because DC thought it &#8216;scientific&rsquo; enough to warrant a film, one cannot dismiss the evidence-Clovis culture, Amerindian genetic DNA markers on the Amerindian Tribes of the East Coast, as well as the physical appearance of the (now extinct) Eastern US tribes, DO/DID show that &#8216;Whites were here first.&rsquo; (which helps explain Mormnism&rsquo;s hypothesis, but does not corroborate it, IMHO) </p>
<p>I would suggest looking up John de Nugent&rsquo;s site for more info on THAT one. (Discovery Channel- as would be expected- no longer &#8216;offers&rsquo; this video/DVD, even though it was selling well, and even began to have &#8216;brisk sales&rsquo; after Bristow&rsquo;s book hit the streets- but it was &#8216;taken off the sales list- due (one can only surmise) to &#8216;pressure&rsquo; from &#8216;hate groups&rsquo; such as the SPLC, etc.</p>
<p>The book is riveting, and skewers a number of liberal archetypes, many of which I have dealt with as a student, and adult- so perhaps that is why the Potoks&rsquo; of the world see themselves in it. It glorifies &#8216;nordic paganism&rsquo; however, and left a sour taste in my mouth, both for its&rsquo; fallaciousness, as well as for its&rsquo; utter incredulityon that religious issue, but it is on a par with the aforementioned novels of this genre.</p>
<p>It was certainly more life-like, more credible, than the dispensationalist escapism of &#8216;christian&rsquo; fiction such as the &#8216;Left Behind&rsquo; books.</p>
<p>My 2 cents&hellip;.<br/>

		<p>The book is quite interesting and decently written.  It&rsquo;s a classic pot-boiler type of thriller, something like Stephen Hunter or Brad Thor would write, but with the bits supporting the hypothosis sprinkled throughout.   The bad guys are all leftists who lie, steal and cheat with impunity - so, in that way it&rsquo;s very realistic. </p>

		<p> I&rsquo;m not real big on reading fiction, but I&rsquo;ll buy and read Mr. Bristow&rsquo;s book, for certain. Sounds fascinating.</p>
<p> Also, did anyone notice how the reporter subtly slants the article against Mr. Bristow and those of us who believe as he does? And lastly, the Southern Professional Liars Center&rsquo;s imprimatur of &#8220;hate fiction&#8221; is trotted out as if it were the last word on the subject. When will the mainstream media ever learn? Or when will they become too ashamed of themselves for giving such credibility to such an organization, that they&rsquo;ll start ignoring it?</p>

<p>Are we talking about the same &#8220;Maya Angelou&#8221; (real name Marguerite Johnson)?  I realize that tastes differ, but I never found anything the least admirable in her puerile scribblings.</p>

		<p>The Solutrean Theory is nonsense. There&rsquo;s no evidence for it, and a lot of evidence against it.</p>
<p>No European or Caucasoid bones in the Americas. Even the ancient bones said to be Caucasian are actually Australoid and not Caucasoid. They resemble Negritos, Melanesians, Aborigines, Papuans and Ainu.</p>
<p>No European genes in the Americas. Chromosome X actually goes back to the Altai 5000 YBP and is not the Chromosome X in Europe.</p>
<p>Clovis points. Fluted points resembling clovis points have now been found in Shandong, China, so it is not true that they have not been found in Asia.</p>
<p>Atlantic journey. New articles show that the Atlantic journey by Europeans crossing in the ice is quite unlikely.</p>
<p>No evidence for Solutrean Theory.</p>
<p>Anyway, Europeans 15-20,000 YBP don&rsquo;t look like Whites!</p>
