			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Copenhagen Post, March 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Copenhagen police established a stop and search zone in Nørrebro on Monday following a week of gang-related gunfire.</p>
<p>The stop and search zone affected most of Nørrebro out to the northwest suburb of Tingbjerg and was a direct result of last week&rsquo;s &#8220;apparent intensification of gang fighting,&#8221; explained the police. Similar stop and search zones were established last week in the suburbs of Tingbjerg and Husum.</p>
<p>Police will now be &#8220;massive and visible&#8221; from Nørrebro out to Tingbjerg and will also be visiting schools in the zone.</p>
<p>Late last Sunday evening, a 19-year-old Danish man named Zoubir Aoussar, was killed by a single shot to his back near Blågards Plads square in Inner Nørrebro. Three assailants pulled up in a grey Mitsubishi and came out shooting, according to police. The car, which was stolen, was found burnt-out in Kongens Lyngby on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is almost certainly gang-related, because of both the time and place, as well as the way it was done,&#8221; the lead investigator Kenneth Vesth told TV 2.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, on Thursday, March 10, a 19-year-old man of Somalian heritage was shot and killed in the Copenhagen suburb of Husum in a drive-by involving an automatic weapon. An 18-year-old and a 22-year-old were wounded but survived.</p>
<p>On Monday, March 7, a taxi with three passengers was shot at in another drive-by. No-one was hit in that incident.</p>
<p>The cases are being handled by the Copenhagen police force&rsquo;s special gang unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know there has been a lot of tension between the different immigrant gangs the last couple of weeks, so that&rsquo;s the direction we&rsquo;re looking right now,&#8221; Knud Hvass, the deputy police commissioner, told Jyllands-Posten newspaper.</p>
<p>In the early hours of Monday, March 14, Task Force East, the Copenhagen Police, the North Zealand Police and the National Police conducted a major dragnet in the Copenhagen area, ransacking 43 different addresses and arresting six people.</p>
<p>The round-up occurred just seven hours after the killing on Blågårds Plads square, but was part of the &#8220;general effort against the gangs&#8221;, according to Lars Borg, press manager for the Copenhagen Police. A loaded pistol, a kilogram of hash and approximately 200,000 kroner in cash were confiscated.</p>

<p>These Somali can&rsquo;t get along with anyone. Ten percent of the Somali men too can field strip an AK in under a minute blindfolded. Very violent.</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s step back and take wide view of this situation: The fact that large quantities of Somali were allowed into Denmark means that Denmark is collectively insane. Taxing Danes to send aid to Somalia might not make good sense, but bringing hoards of them into Denmark doesn&rsquo;t even make bad sense (except to liberals).</p>

		<p>(Field stripping an AK should not take longer than ten seconds. Blindfolded ;b)<br>
-In a way, these turf wars are encouraging - they are a sign of saturation; that there are not unlimited Danish blondes to rape. Plus they will awaken more Whites.<br>
Except, of course, that they will be used as an excuse to further build up the police state.</p>

		<p>A sort of random comment here:  seems that Europeans are unable to deal with Somalis, either the pirates in the Red Seas, or the gang warfare in their own cities. One wonders how future generations will view this: as a 21st century version of Barbary Pirates?</p>

		<p>as bad as the US is, at least we have a criminal justice infrastructure to deal with crime.</p>
<p>Europe has created a criminal nonwhite underclass, but not the infrastructure to cope with it.</p>
<p>right now, they own the streets without any meaningful challenge from the authorities.</p>
<p>students beat up teachers in the classroom with impunity, random subway attacks, etc., &amp; the consequences are a few weeks in a comfy prison.</p>
<p>there are 21-year-olds who have been to jail a dozen times already for violent crimes:<br>
that is how short the prison terms are here.</p>
<p>the criminal justice system in countries like Denmark was designed for an all white society that was virtually crime free, and with a tiny number of people applying for welfare - and only when they really needed it.</p>
<p>every European today (every REAL European) dreams of the same thing:</p>
<p>to live among whites only.</p>

		<p>The bureaucrats in the EU are hoping to destroy the European nation-states once and for all with by pushing multiculturalism and the invasion by non-whites.</p>
<p>If Europe is to save its nation-states and preserve its indigenous white populations, the EU needs to be disbanded. The EU is the worse thing that ever happened to whites.</p>

		<p>Elitist:  Excuse me?  How is the US different, again?  WHAT infrastructure do we have to deal with blacks again?  How, again, are WE better prepared to deal with Somalis or any other black thug as opposed to the Danes?  WE have liberal activist judges too, many more than the Danish.  WE have Somalis, Nigerians, Ethiopians, etc being imported all the time AND we had our own native black problems before we went insane and started importing more.  WE have cops that won&rsquo;t go into certain areas unless they absolutely have to.  WE have whole cities that are no-go zones.  How are we different again?<br>
We are far more down the slope than France, Denmark or any other European country, especially when talking about blacks.  AND, Europe does not have the two front war we do - Mexicans, Salvadorans, Columbians, Cubans and other HIspanic gangs pouring across THEIR borders as we do.  You are deluding yourself about how we are in any way better or better prepared.</p>

What?!?!!!<br>
Gang warfare?</p>
<p>In civilized, peaceful Denmark?   <br>
Incredible!</p>
<p>Until a few decades ago, this would have been unimaginable. <br>
But now that Denmark has been &#8220;enriched&#8221; with Diversity, they are having the same Third World problems that we have.</p>
<p>When everything was working beautifully and nothing was &#8220;broken&#8221;, why did the busybodies and social engineers have to go and  &#8220;fix&#8221; it?  <br>
&hellip;Just as they did with Canada, Sweden, etc., etc.</p>
<p><br>
Moral: when you import Third World populations, you get Third World problems.  (Should that be a surprise?)</p>
