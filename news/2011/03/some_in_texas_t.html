<h1>Some in Texas Town Blaming Young Girl in Assault</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan A. Lozano, Houston Chronicle, March 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A meeting Thursday night that was billed as a way to discuss concerns some have about the investigation into a series of alleged sexual assaults on an 11-year-old girl turned into a forum that many used to blame the girl police contend is the victim of heinous attacks.</p>
<p>Many who attended the meeting said they supported the group of men and boys who have been charged in the case. Supporters didn&rsquo;t claim that the men and boys did not have sex with the young girl; instead they blamed the girl for the way she dressed or claimed she must have lied about her age  &mdash;  accusations that have drawn strong responses from those who note an 11-year-old cannot consent to sex and that it doesn&rsquo;t matter how she was dressed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police say the girl was sexually assaulted during several attacks last year. Authorities have arrested 18 people, including two of Cleveland&rsquo;s star high school athletes and adults with criminal records. {snip}</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s meeting was led by Quanell X, an activist prominent in Houston&rsquo;s black community. He told the audience of more than 130 people who had packed a small community center that the gathering&rsquo;s goal was not to criticize the girl but to question the investigation by police, although he did question why she didn&rsquo;t report the attack to authorities herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not come here this evening to jump on an 11-year-old girl,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The activist, who was invited to speak by a local pastor, said he was concerned that only young black men had been arrested. He said he believed some of those arrested were guilty but that others were not. He told those in attendance that if they were questioned by police about the case that they should only talk to police with a lawyer present.</p>
<p>During the meeting, Quanell X also asked people to donate money to the defense funds for two of those arrested in the case.</p>
<p>After the meeting, many in attendance told reporters that the girl had consented to the sex.</p>
<p>&#8220;She lied about her age. Them boys didn&rsquo;t rape her. She wanted this to happen. I&rsquo;m not taking nobody&rsquo;s side, but if she hadn&rsquo;t put herself in that predicament, this would have never happened,&#8221; said Angie Woods, who lives in Houston but grew up in Cleveland.</p>

Unlike the defendants, evidently. </p>
<p>In any case, thanks for the clarification, Mr. X. Very glad to learn you don&rsquo;t endorse gangbangs of 11-yr-olds. Now see if you can convince your black brothas that they shouldn&rsquo;t either.<br>

		<p>While it is true that girls are hyper sexualized at younger and younger ages but that does not excuse the actions of these boys. It is a typical reaction for blacks to defend their own no matter what the offense might be- OJ Simpson anyone? This Quanell X is just about the most racist and hateful individual of any race ever given a public forum. I could not imagine anyone blaming a mere child for a horrifically violent rape by nearly 30 men! Even with the great variations in development at age 11 I doubt most adults would mistake a girl this age for being an adult.</p>

		<p>In our current society, it is racist to deny sex to an African.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are male or female, in prison or out of prison, 1 yr old or 100 years old, invalid or healthy. If you do not allow a Black person to have sex with you, then you are an evil racist.  </p>

		<p>Sometimes we think if we just tried harder, we&rsquo;d wake up more of White Humanity to the dangers inherent in allowing the blacks to stay here in America, and they would rush to join our ranks of Race Realism.</p>

		<p>Good Grief, I thought this debate was over. Silly me. </p>
<p>For centuries rapists have been blaming the victim as the source of their own attack. In addition to the rape and sexual assault charges these lads should have the aggravating charge of a &#8220;hate&rsquo; crime as the 11 year old girl is a member of a protected minority i.e. females. In addition I read she was of Hispanic ethnicity<br>
It will add time to their sentence.<br>
Attacking females from a different group as a demonstration of power is as old as humanity. <br>
It will stop when women from all communities want it to stop.</p>

		<p>There you have it, an unmediated look into the black mentality. Since there were at least eighteen people involved this whole affair must have dragged out for some time and openly known in the area, yet no action was taken to put a halt to it. This is one of those moments when one can see the actual thinking process as it really is rather than what people wish it was.   </p>

		<p>This case highlights what has already become the salient point of friction in America: between Hispanics and Blacks. I witnessed this tension daily during my time stationed at Fort Bliss, in El Paso. This incident is really just the opening salvo in Texas of the greater conflict that has already been taking place for some time in California. It shows how flimsy the liberal buzz-phrase &#8220;people of color&#8221; truly is. Hispanics have no desire to align themselves beneath the banner of a rainbow coalition, or of any coalition outside of their own racial group.</p>
<p>There was an article on this site some months ago &#8220;White Man in a Texas Prison&#8221; that mentioned when blacks, whites, and Hispanics are crowded in together, in terms of pathology and behaviour Hispanics tend to form a more simpatico relationship with whites against blacks. </p>
<p>Something tells me they have a powder keg down in Cleveland, Texas, and that as grim as this act was, the violence has just begun.</p>

		<p>Sure&hellip;right&hellip;there are just too many eleven year old girls running around out there wearing makeup and fantasizing about being gang raped by 28 black men.  Notice that despite and probably because of the fact that the media, the government,  academia and the leftist next door are all pretending not to notice black social pathology that black behavior in America keeps getting worse and worse.  This incident should disgust any decent person regardless of race and the apologist for this brutal &#8220;flash mob&#8221; rape are facilitating future similar behavior.</p>
<p>Remember when they used to say &#8220;No Justice, No Peace&#8221;?   I suggest that we are now closing in on &#8220;No Peace, No Peace&#8221;.   Things are fast becoming intolerable.</p>

<p>The 11-year-old girl was Hispanic.  (It is not clear whether she is illegal or Tejano.)</p>
<p>All of the adults charged with rape are black.  I am unable to confirm the race of the minors charged in the case, but the parent of at least one of the minors in black.</p>

		<p>Whites must wake up to the facts about black afros (maybe Quanell X can strike the alarm):  </p>
<p>blacks do not understand our morality and ethics, nor do they want to or attempt to- our niceness is a sign of weakness to be exploited by them</p>
<p>blacks who &#8220;act White&#8221; are just fooling Whites with an old tried and true voodoo trick</p>
<p>blacks don&rsquo;t care about building or preserving civilization, they only want immediate impulse gratification, be it bongo drums, sex, theft, or violence because they can&rsquo;t help themselves from being violent- everything is temporary and transient for them</p>
<p>blacks can shoot a White and not fear the death penalty, because black judges won&rsquo;t give the death penalty to black convicts when the victim is White-  the entire apparatus Govt. and DOJ has sent down the memo- no death penalty for blacks who kill Whites-</p>

		<p>This case is very similar to a case in Cobb County, GA 7 or 8 years ago in which 20 Blacks raped a retarded 13 year old girl. Just like in this case, the families of the rapists felt that it was all the girl&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>Could it be true? Is the allure of these preteen or retarded vixens too strong for young Black men to resist? Are our little brothers the prey of conniving adolescent temptresses? </p>
<p>Or are these incidents just confirmation that we have a filthy third world nation that exists in a parallel dimension alongside our nation?</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no wonder these rapists feel they did nothing wrong, look at the mindset within the black community of supporters. It&rsquo;s hard to fathom that a bunch of rapists would actually have a community of supporters looking to place the blame on the police and this little girl. But then again, they&rsquo;re always the victim, never the culprit.</p>
<p>Two, I find it impossible to believe that this 11 year old girl looks and acts eighteen. I&rsquo;ve seen some kids who looked mature in my day, but I&rsquo;ve never a witnessed a seven year difference. And lets just say that for the sake of argument, this 11 year old girl wanted to be gang raped, you know just because she thought it would be cool or something like that. Who knows what 11 year old&rsquo;s think now days? Do you mean to tell me there wasn&rsquo;t one of these rapists that didn&rsquo;t feel that that was wrong? Of course not. Because these rapists are animals, they&rsquo;re not civilized and they are always the victim.</p>
<p>The audacity to video this gang rape by cell phone and then pass the footage around and brag about such acts prove that this group of rapists are not civilized and need to be punished to the fullest extent that law will allow. And these families of supporters had better hope that one day it&rsquo;s not their daughter that is brutally gang raped. Because karma can be a bitch.</p>

		<p>Quanell X aka Quanell Ralph Evans aka Quanell X Abdul Farrakhan was a petty crack dealer who was arrested in 1989 and convicted in 1993 of selling crack cocaine in Harris County felony case # 0526655. I have yet to see the news media refer to him as &#8220;former crack dealer Quanell X,&#8221; and of course Wikipedia makes no mention of Quanell&rsquo;s criminal history. </p>
<p>In 1990 Quanell joined Nation of Islam and became a community organizer. For a $2500 fee, this &#8220;civil rights leader&#8221; will make an appearance at a press conference and denounce whitey. </p>

<p>Even if she did lie about her age, I explained here at AR in an earlier story about this gang rape that the law in most states presumes that a girl that young could lie all she wants but the men ought to know that a girl with that young looking of a face can&rsquo;t be of the legal age of consent.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m dark enough that some of you amren readers would mistake me for black if you saw me; nonetheless, I think everyone one of these rapists needs to be lynched and dragged behind a car. It&rsquo;s very embarrassing that Blacks will keep defending their own rapists, murderers, etc. It makes me embarrassed to have the same skin color as them.</p>

		<p>Some of these morons evidently made cellphone still shots and a video of the &#8220;event&#8221;? A number of decades ago now, someone made the observation that the civilized man and the barbarian both commit the same crimes and engage in the same depravity. But the civilized man will try to hide what occurred, while the barbarian either makes no effort to hide what occurred or even glorifies the deed and makes it known to the whole world. </p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it: this crime is not a crime in the black community, so it should be a crime to us.   If blacks defend blacks who gang rape kids, then accept the defense and let the perps go free.</p>
<p>We should endorse the Sharia Law paradigm: communities of color should police and adjudicate themselves based on their own cultural traditions and legal system.</p>
<p>We should be ashamed of ourselves for ever trying to force blacks and aztecs to live under the White Man&rsquo;s British Common Law.  Let&rsquo;s emancipate them to live under their own fruit tree as God so provides.</p>
<p>Then, in the negotiation, demand that for our courtesy and &#8220;cultural sensitivity&#8221; and &#8220;acknowledgement of enriching differences,&#8221; they stay out of our lands.</p>
<p>Sounds like a pretty good offer: we&rsquo;ll let you live however you want, as long as you never live anywhere near here.<br>

By the way, i tell every white cop I meet in my racially divided town, that i don&rsquo;t want them getting along with blacks as long as they embrace criminality.

Dixie Guards: It may well be your experience that &#8216;who &ldquo;act White&rdquo; are just fooling Whites with an old tried and true voodoo trick&#8221;, but I have experienced a few cases where this simply is not true. I have known black people that I would trust with anything, anytime. <br>
I am indeed far more suspicious of blacks(for reasons borne of my own real- world experience and close study of black affairs worldwide.<br>
But I can tell a man&rsquo;s character from the way he holds himself, and I see black men pass me on the street whom I&rsquo;d not fear one bit. I can see they are decent and peaceful. Then there are a great many I look at though the back of my skull, because they broadcast their untrustworthiness, even if they do not strut, shuck, jive, or show the least bit of overt signs of being predators.</p>
<p>I know our experiences (like being descended upon by a pack of drooling baboons, and forced to fight for our lives) can color our perception. I have had to face off a mob while defending myself against their point man. Having hit the point man back in the face, the drooling mob just looked, glassy eyed, and  allowed me to turn away without incident. I will never forget that moment. But That doesn&rsquo;t negate the goodness I&rsquo;ve know from some blacks.<br>
The general rules DO prevail, and better safe than DEAD. But individual human beings still trump the group. I&rsquo;d avoid a crowd of blacks anytime I could. But I can see an honest face and spot the difference.</p>

<p>Oh, but when that cheap 27-year old Bantu stripper Crystal Mangum, claimed the Duke lacrosse team gang-raped her, Bantus foamed at the mouth like rabid dogs and screamed hysterically. They did the same when Michael Jackson was accused of sleeping with all those little boys.

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve written before, the USA resembles a feudalistic society more than a republic, since fiefdoms with concommitant entitlements and privelege are handed down by the Political Class to certain well-defined groups with that privelege being hereditary.Affirmative action prefference is just one manifestation of this neo feudalism, it also extends legalistically with the preferred groups gaining judicial exemptions (ie loaded juries).<br>

 A silly and ridiculous prank, one might think, others might be puzzled as to why such an innocuous object as a cotton ball can be construed as the sum of all evil.<br>
 Well anyway a whole media circus rolled into town.&rsquo;Civil rights&rsquo; advocates made windy, terajerking and impassioned speeches, promising Hellfire and damnation and to &#8216;whoop crackers&rsquo; a$$es (as they put it), church sermons were delivered, college deans were forced to prostrate themselves and plead for mercy and the young kids who dared commit the outrage publicly humiliated and shamed and bundled out of college.<br>

		<p>Rajesh you don&rsquo;t need to apologize for your ancestors living in a sunny climate. We all know black skin correlates to nothing but reduced vitamin D production. Blacks are the way they are collectively because of low IQs and the ease (not in our sense, but in the prehistoric sense) in which they lived and reproduced. There was little environmental pressure to root out the incapable. </p>
<p>This story is vile. Even if the victim &#8220;wanted&#8221; it to happen (the sexualization of children in America is alarming) there is unfortunately no excuse for the macho bucks 18 and older. But I doubt that&rsquo;s the case anyway. Love how silent feminists are when these kinds of situations arise and there&rsquo;s no way to blame a white guy.</p>

<p>I was in law enforcement.  Every purse snatcher and his mamma and preacher blamed the victims for carrying purses and being White haired old White ladies out on the public streets.  I spent hours and hours listening to the hooting and hollering of their Mothers and preachers complete with the arm waving, leg waving, pacing gesticulating body language and all the black showing off screeching etc.</p>
<p>How dare old women carry purses and leave their houses to shop, visit friends, get their hair cut and other things.</p>
<p>Even when the women were in their upper 80&rsquo;s and were seriously injured and disabled for life by the animals the blacks always defended the blacks.  It was all that old ladie&rsquo;s fault and if she had to spend the rest of her life comatose in a nursing home the black who knocked her down and stomped on her could not be blamed for her frail bones and heart.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how the &#8220;cotton ballers&#8221; case turned out:</p>
<p>Both white men received two years probation, 80 hours of community service and had their drivers licenses suspended for 60 days.  All for the charge of littering.  There were no &#8220;hate crimes&#8221; riders, mainly because the Circuit Attorney didn&rsquo;t think he could prove that they were motivated by racial enmity.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s insane on two counts   &mdash;   One, the prosecutors thinking that investigating racial enmity is proper for sprinkling cotton balls on a sidewalk, two, such a harsh sentence for littering, and three, that the group of people for whom the black student center was designed, the ones who always say they&rsquo;re so tough and strong, are supposedly psychologically traumatized by seeing cotton balls on a sidewalk.</p>
