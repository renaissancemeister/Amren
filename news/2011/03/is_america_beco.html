<h1>Is America Becoming a Hispanic Country?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ruben Navarrette Jr., CNN, March 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The United States is becoming an Hispanic country. And it&rsquo;s happening much faster than anyone expected.</p>
<p>According to an analysis of newly released 2010 U.S. Census data by the Pew Hispanic Center, the Hispanic population in the United States is growing more quickly and more dramatically than demographers had estimated.</p>
<p>In the 33 states for which data has been released so far, there are almost 600,000 more Hispanics than previously thought. Twenty-eight states had more Hispanics than expected. And, while the current count is 38.7 million Hispanics, there is still data coming from 17 states, making it likely that the final figure could surpass 55 million, or 17% of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One day soon, Hispanics will help define the worlds of media, politics, commerce, fashion, music, entertainment, sports and science. There will be no turning back.</p>
<p>But you knew that already. Maybe your first hint was the Latina models on magazine covers. Or that salsa is more popular than ketchup. Or the Spanish-language billboards you see on rural highways. Or that some members of Congress gather weekly for Spanish lessons.</p>
<p>Or maybe you figured out that the Hispanic population in the United States was exploding when you saw the quixotic efforts of some to stop the trend by cracking down on illegal immigration and  &mdash;  for an encore  &mdash;  trying to limit legal immigration as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, for many Americans, changing demographics isn&rsquo;t cause for celebration. Rather, it&rsquo;s cause for alarm. It brings a sense of fear, anxiety and desperation. They know enough to know that the country in which they grew up is changing, and they&rsquo;ll do whatever they can to reverse those changes and return the cultural landscape to what it used to be.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ultimately, you can&rsquo;t fight demographics. Hispanics are already here, and most of them aren&rsquo;t going anywhere. Instead of wishing otherwise, Americans would be better off accepting this new reality. While they&rsquo;re at it, they should acknowledge the positive impact to their communities and their country of having a growing population of people who are, by nature, conservative, hardworking, optimistic, patriotic and entrepreneurial. Hispanics aren&rsquo;t a threat to the United States; they&rsquo;re an essential component.</p>
<p>Visit any military cemetery in the United States and count the Spanish surnames. You&rsquo;ll see that Hispanics have already contributed so much to this country. And, in the decades to come, they and their children stand ready to contribute so much more  &mdash;  if we put aside our prejudice and let them. {snip}<br>

<p>CNN&rsquo;s logic is similar to: Ultimately, you can&rsquo;t fight rape. If you are already being raped, you shouln&rsquo;t fight it, but sit back and &#8220;enjoy the new reality.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The Census Bureau predicts that 1 out of 4 people in the US will be Hispanic by mid-century, which is twice the current ratio. Further, the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 46% of the current population growth will be due to Hispanics.</p>
<p>Such a huge demographic shift is nothing to celebrate about. On the contrary, it is something that is very alarming.</p>
<p>There is a conservative writer whose name is Heather Macdonald. She has written some very excellent articles documenting the Hispanic problem. Here are links to some of her articles:</p>

		<p>At the Battle of Yorktown it was the combined talents and treasure of the French under Rochambeau, the Spanish Governor of Cuba and our great George Washington who defeated Cornwallis and the British Empire.<br>
The Cubans also contributed 50,000 pieces of coin.Without these stalwart allies we might still be singing &#8216;Long Live the Queen.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>The mainstream states that Whites will be a minority in 2042?!  Thats Bull!!!  I think that anyone with a brain in their head can see that.  We are - RIGHT NOW - ABOUT 58% OF THE POPULATION.  The so-called demographers don&rsquo;t take into the consideration the probably over 30,000,000 illegals here now.  How can you not factor these people into the equation?!  There&rsquo;s no sign that they&rsquo;re ever going to be deported.  There&rsquo;s no sign that the flood of illegal AND also legal immigration will ever be stemmed.  310 million + 30 million = 340 million.  There are 200 million of &#8220;us&#8221;.  Do the math. The tide is getting stronger now.  We&rsquo;re talking about minority status within 10-15 years.</p>

		<p>Another of the many examples of Hispanics openly stating their racial preference for America-and it doesn&rsquo;t include the  Native Born White American Majority. And this is being done in a  full-blown-in-your-face-manner. This bold-face hispanic racial aggresion is encourage by Liberals,Leftists and the sociopathic Republican and Democratic  traitors in the &#8220;US&#8221; Congress.</p>
<p>Either Native Born White Americans start to express their racial preference and identity in as open and in-your-face-kind of way as the Hispanics do or they will be race-replaced by Hispnaics.</p>
<p>When accused of being racist, Native Born White American Patriots must give many examples of the double standard and throw the racism charge back at the accuser.</p>
<p>And we should also state emphatically that Rubin Navarette and Hispanics in general are wagaing a vicious war of race-replacement aggression&hellip;and Native Born White Americans are being forced to subsidize their own race-replacement at the hands of high fertility post-1965 Hispanics. They are under no obligation to do this because Rubin Navarette demands that we do. </p>

		<p>Ruben Navarette has always been anti-White, therefore anti-America. I never read any of his trashy articles.  He gloats whenever he &#8220;sees&#8221; the take-over by hispanics&hellip;Do morons like him ever THINK about what America will look like and be like if any nonwhite race takes over? </p>
<p> Hey, Ruben, how about America looking like Mexico complete with the drug cartel gangs sweeping the nation? It almost does now, thanks to people like you and your amigos flooding OUR land..You like that?</p>

		<p>I have to wonder if this has been somehow engineered. Since Hispanics seem to get special benefits that native citizens are somehow not entitled to they can have babies without taking a financial hit. Even with expensive medical insurance we will still be paying 3,000 or more when all the bills come due after the birth of our second child. Illegals get free medical, food, rent and utility assistance and get paid a similar wage to us Americans who have to pay for it. Since they often live 10-15 to a house they have more disposable income. I have seen very late model vehicles with expensive stereos and rims in out neighborhood- in houses where there are often 5-6 cars parked in front at any given time. </p>

		<p>If the current tide of illegal/legal immigration does not stop we are looking at having a country with 400-500 million people. To fund the massive unemployment and welfare state that will ensue taxes will be jacked higher than ever. This will stifle business growth creating even more unemployment. I just can&rsquo;t see how America will not collapse into anarchy. Massive unemployment,huge budget and trade deficits and a multi-racial society with everyone at each other&rsquo;s throat. Makes me wish I was in my 90&rsquo;s not 30&rsquo;s.</p>

		<p>While I do agree that we are doomed to become another third world outpost of the spanish-speaking world, I take exception to the mention in this article of all the &#8216;positives&rsquo; that will come from becoming latinos or living under their thumb.</p>
<p>I am around a LOT of latinos.  Where I work it is a 90% latino neighborhood.    In fact, I see Latinos more than any other group no matter where I go, in any direction, even if I travel for hours.  My boss is latino (public sector affirmative action hire) and about half of my coworkers are also.  And I am in a northeastern metropolitan area, not in Arizona or Florida.</p>
<p>I can, therefore, speak authoritatively on the &#8216;contributions&rsquo; of latinos to the fabric of American life.</p>
<p>#1 They push out all non-spanish speakers fairly quickly through direct and indirect means.</p>
<p>#2 Almost ALL of their young people are USELESS.  Can I repeat that a few more times.  Some gangbang, others are so low IQ as to be unbelievable.  So many of their teens get pregnant.  Welfare and government assistance.</p>
<p>#3 They have an inflated view of the value of their culture.  Even though white people have made almost all the advances in the arts, sciences, political philosophies, etc., they take their &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; culture of endless fiestas, their basket weaving native arts and their childish slavery to marxism as some kind of cultural achievmements.</p>
<p>#4 While most are nice people to one degree or another, they have vastly different cultural habits: loud, brash and assertive, substance abuse, prone to foolish ideas etc.</p>
<p>To those who say we should celebrate becoming latino, I ask you, can you name me one Latin American nation that is a civilized model of social justice, efficiency, good living, economic prosperity and upwardly mobile with a high standard of living for all? </p>

		<p>Ruben Naverette: &#8220;&hellip;for many Americans, changing demographics isn&rsquo;t cause for celebration. Rather, it&rsquo;s cause for alarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas demographer Steve Murdock provides one simple-to-understand reason the Hispanization of America should alarm anyone who cares about America. </p>
<p>From the Houston Chronicle blog:  </p>
<p>&#8220;The state&rsquo;s [Texas&rsquo;] future looks bleak assuming the current trend line does not change because education and income levels for Hispanics lag considerably behind Anglos, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless the trend line changes, 30 percent of the state&rsquo;s labor force will not have even a high school diploma by 2040, he said. And the average household income will be about $6,500 lower than it was in 2000. That figure is not inflation adjusted so it will be worse than what it sounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&rsquo;s a terrible situation that you are in. I am worried,&rsquo;&#8221; Murdock said.&#8221;</p>
<p>SOURCE:  Texas demographer: &#8216;It&rsquo;s basically over for Anglos&rsquo;<br>

		<p>Rubin Naverette, the author of this article, has also written a book titled &lsquo;A Darker Shade of Crimson&rsquo;. Read it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/4he2a2r" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/4he2a2r</a></p>
<p>It is an autobiography of a 25-year old Harvard affirmative action graduate obsessed with his own ethnicity. In this manner Rubin&rsquo;s accomplishments have eclipsed Barack&rsquo;s, Barack not having put out his autobiography until the age of 33. </p>
<p>Rubin closes his work with the revelation that he must turn and bite the hand of the white system that has &lsquo;fed me so well for so long&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Again Ruben is failing to take into account that these mesitzo peasant&rsquo;s lifestyle are totally funded by white taxpayers. </p>
<p>There IS going to have to be a massive cut back in the welfare state. This is now a question of if, not when.When their goodies get taken away from them,these invaders will either move back or become violent. A flashpoint will be reached when even the most liberal whites see these people as they are when they are invading their gated communities en mass looking for food, supplies and women to rape.</p>
<p>Either they cut back the welfare state or the bottom will fall out of it completely. Violence sadly is on our future and it won&rsquo;t end well for the mestizos.In a war between La Raza gangbangers and well armed whites with military experience,I know who I&rsquo;d put my money on.</p>
<p>Ignore these doomsayers.We&rsquo;re going to be just fine in the end.</p>

		<p>The die has been cast and the nation as currently constituted is dead.  The best solution would be to admit our mistakes (allowing mass immigration and our generosity towards them) and seek a velvet divorce ala Czechoslovakia.  Of course the velvet divorce is impossible (this is THEIR country) so the next best course of action is to admit our mistake and take a portion of the US as our own.  Sometimes it is better to admit failure and move on.  I would rather live in a smaller, white US than live like the whites in South Africa (or even Brazil). Ugly and bloody it would be but it is our only chance.  The real question is do we have the guts to fight back? </p>
<p>The government would be against us but would the bulk of the military?   All the white nationalist talk of taking back America is foolishness - the Mexicans alone have too many strongholds from California to Massachusetts to make that possible.  But a new, smaller United States is possible if we had the will.  </p>
<p>I truly believe that this was engineered, but why?  White self-hatred and quilt?  This is enough to doom your children and grandchildren?  A Jewish plot because Jews hate white Christians?  But do Jews really think a Hispanic/black America will support Israel?  Even in the aftermath of 9-11 we didn&rsquo;t end immigration from Islamic countries, in fact we brought in hundreds of thousands as refugees!  How insane is that?  And let us remember it was a nominally white president who invaded Afghanistan and Iraq where thousand of white men have been killed and thousands more maimed.  </p>
<p>Absolutely nothing that has happened since 1965 has made any sense whatsoever.  Perhaps it boils down to hubris and a sense of white superiority.  That our elites (the ultimate white supremacists) believe that all people, deep down, can be just like us, and that if we try hard enough everyone in the world can be just like a white person?  And that they will prove their thesis even if it means we must all pay the ultimate price.  Group madness.<br>

		<p>3-Prof Helen: &#8220;It&rsquo;s about values and lasting principles not temporary pigmentation.&#8221;: I would have to disagree. There are often conversations about what great values some asian groups have, or as mentioned in this article, the Hispanics.  But so what?  I wouldn&rsquo;t care if every race on the planet had &#8220;better&#8221; values than those of my group - I still do not care to be extirpated just for the sake of allowing some other group of people to take over my living space.  A couple other things I do not get: Since when will America be minority White?  I say it never will be, since once we are a minority, &#8220;America&#8221; as the world knows it will cease to exist. It will cease to exist in terms of the basic ethno-culture of its founding, and may very well be torn apart by ethnocentric conflict. I&rsquo;ve read (on this site I believe) some commenters state that Whites should protest more for our rights.  Say what?  A group of Whites protesting with signs for their rights?  Sorry, I just don&rsquo;t see that as the way to go.  As for the White Spanish assisting with our revolution, well fine, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we needed to let half the world&rsquo;s people, many with far differing values to our own, into our country.  We have been lied to and our nation is being destroyed day by day.  I&rsquo;m not sure how it is going to end, but I do not see peace and prosperity long into the future of whatever nations will come out of this multicultural crime that is currently known as America. And one other thing - Since it appears we may well be given a choice of singing &#8220;Long live the Queen&#8221; or a Spanish-Islam version of &#8220;Kill the (American)Boer&#8221;, I&rsquo;m betting many Whites will choose the former.</p>

		<p>Navarrette (and the commentators) forget this is not a two population situation; it is not whitey vs. the Hispanics. What about the Africans (imported and home grown), Indians, Orientals (chinese, vietnamese, Korean, hmong, etc), and Muslims (mideast and near east) who want to colonize the U.S.? There is some alliance among these groups to destroy the remnants of white resistance, but I don&rsquo;t think it is strong or long lasting. Also the Hispanics themselves are divided into many subgroups, who do not like or actively despise one another.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, white men in the U.S. and elsewhere have lost control of the territories that they once dominated. Will a Hispanic coalition control Los estados unidos?  Perhaps, but paisanos will have to defeat far more dangerous foes than Navarrette refers to.</p>

<p>Media, Univision? Music and entertainment basically the same and I haven&rsquo;t seen any Hispanic trend. So too with fashion.</p>
<p>Mexico must be heaven on earth. I wonder why Mexicans leave.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s an uphill fight to stop legal immigration, because the corporations and financial speculators demand more consumers.  Hispanics just happen to be close by, are fast breeders, and present little threat to the elites.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I have to wonder if this has been somehow engineered.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have to WONDER?  Is it not obvious?  This is White genocide.  It&rsquo;s not a Mexican problem.  Nobody is flooding Mexico with millions of non-Mexicans and telling Mexico to create a blended humanity, and then calling any Mexicans who object racists.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a WHITE problem, it&rsquo;s WHITE GENOCIDE.  Wake up, Amren readers!  It IS engineered.  They want to replace Whites because Whites are the only people intelligent, organized, and civic-minded enough to stand up against the various oppressive cruelties your elite masters have in mind for you when they consolidate power!  Ever look at a brown country?  Yes, it&rsquo;s unorganized, yes it&rsquo;s full of unintelligent people, yes, they have no heritage of standing up to government authority and demanding individual rights.  Put the pieces together!  They want a brown nation of serfs that won&rsquo;t fight back, will work for peanuts, watch TV, do drugs, and sit around all day while they have absolutely no freedom or input in the design of the nation!  They want a brown country.  You&rsquo;re White.  Therefore, you&rsquo;re slated for White genocide!</p>
<p>How can anyone not see this?  Promoting miscegenation.  Promoting anything non-White.  Calling Whites who defend White heritage racist.  Monetary redistribution to non-Whites.  Rampant non-White crime, perpetrated disproportionately against Whites, yet a media black-out (and anyone who points out the facts even using the DOJ statistics is called a racist).  Most important: massive non-White immigration, both legal and illegal, into America, which is supposed to be a WHITE nation (&#8220;for our posterity&#8221; in the Preamble, 200 years of explicitly pro-White immigration before the treasonous 1965 Act reversed it).  Wake up White America, you&rsquo;re experiencing White genocide!</p>

		<p>How unbelievable to presently ask the question, can Western Civilization be saved in time? It is estimated that in this country by 2050, one out of every third person will be a Hispanic = third world country. Is this intentional planned by the global elitists against the common man, yes. The common man in the western world is having more and more of his wealth and power be taken away by these elitists. The latest subprime debacle is the latest attempt to take away wealth from the middle class by creating money out of thin air which dilutes the worth of savings, house, etc.   Wealth is more and more concentrated in the hands of the few. The presently allowed massive influx of uneducated third world peoples is used to dilute the white majority and to cause an economic burden to destroy the middle class living standard thereby indirectly, taking power and wealth away at the same time.  The elitists do not want the whites to be the majority in their own countries.  It interferes with their plan of world dominance.  This has been an ongoing battle for centuries.</p>

		<p>Navarrette posts regularly at Pajamas Media blog. He is a vile progressive shill who gloats over the disempowerment of whites by hispanics. His articles are a thinly-disguised veneer of argumentation covering a hatred of whites. But in his mindless glee, he conveniently forgets that the result will be hispanics engaged in endless war with all the other burgeoning minorities. At the close of each rejoinder to his rants, I challenge him with the following: </p>
<p>&#8216;I&rsquo;m truly interested&hellip;  exactly what kind of society do regressives like Navarrette envision if we continue to have unlimited immigration into this country?  They have never deigned to inform us.  What will society look like in the not-too-distant future, say around 2025?  I personally expect it will look like something out of the movie Bladerunner, except of course with the cognoscenti like Navarrette living in pristine gated communities as befits their stature of benign tyrant taking care of the little people.  Is this what he and his minions secretly desire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So far, he has never had the cojones to respond.</p>

		<p>The CNN article is breathtaking in its dishonesty.</p>
<p>In all Latin American countries as far as I know, the white minority which runs the country lives in all-white enclaves patrolled by armed guards.</p>
<p>The rest live in squalid, crime-ridden slums without basic sanitation.</p>
<p>American Hispanics don&rsquo;t contribute enough in taxes to sustain the social welfare system.</p>
<p>Common sense combined with arithmetic tells us that the welfare system will collapse soon, leaving a gigantic Hispanic underclass which lives in squalid, etc. (see above).</p>
<p>The blacks will also stop getting their goodies, and will become much more aggressive and violent than they are now, if that&rsquo;s even possible to imagine.</p>
<p>Essentially, the situation is very simple:</p>
<p>The white tax base will be unable to fund vast social welfare expenditures for the new minority-majority, and there is no combination of factors that would prevent us from becoming just another Latin American style Third World country.</p>
<p>Rich whites will live in heavily guarded enclaves, non-rich whites are doomed unless they can retreat to affordable white majority enclaves.</p>
<p>Given federal law, the only way of creating white communities now is by making real estate prices so expensive that only whites (and quite a few Asians) can afford to live there.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re asking us to celebrate the US turning into Brazil.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nothing: over here in Europe, we&rsquo;re expected to celebrate having Switzerland turn into Tunisia!!</p>

<p>Our government will, certainly, make sure the 20 million to 30 million illegal Mexicans will not be going anywhere.  The reality is that our government has betrayed the European American citizen and our country.  Think about it: A country that does not care enough about itself to defend its own border and laws and way of life.<br>

&ldquo;Visit any military cemetery in the United States and count the Spanish surnames.

<p>To Poster #3:  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about values and lasting principles not temporary pigmentation.&rdquo;  No, it is about a mindset toward an awareness of life and a way of pursuing existence and staying within one&rsquo;s own race.  To amalgamate Mexican upon Mexican upon Mexican into a country that was founded by European Americans for European Americans not only changes but, ultimately, does kill an entire culture and civilization (European American/European); this is, really, what Mr. Ruben Navarrette Jr. and his controllers at CNN are about and most interested in accomplishing.  <br>

Nevertheless, the high rate of immigration, and particularly Hispanic immigration, is a major reason for the growing income gap. More immigrants mean more customers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower jobs, and higher profits. <br>

<p>Well this is just a silly and sloppy lead sentence, which can never be.  Once a certain threshold of Hispanics is reached, the United States will cease to exist, as whites decide they have to reason to continue to be dispossessed.  At that point, the seething Hispanic masses will have occupied some areas that were formerly a part of the United States, but this is not the same as saying that the United States will become a Hispanic country.  There will first be separation.  Spanish will not drive out English, for example - rather, English speakers will find a way to set up their own new nation.</p>

<p>Yes, you can fight demographics, and we should have continued to do so in 1965.  Now, you can still fight, by stemming the tide, deporting the illegals, and mitigating the damage.  If necessary, concede part of the Southwest as having been conquered, and give it to Mexico, after which it will quickly deteriorate.</p>

		<p>Trends are reversible. From 1960 to 1980 the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants tripled from 1,887.2 to 5,950.0.  <br>
 <br>
By 2009 the crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants declined to 3,465.5. This was partially because from 1980 to 2000 the prison population in the United States increased from 315,974 to 1,428,187. In addition, legalized abortion resulted in the destruction of millions of fetuses that would have grown up to become criminals.<br>
 <br>
From 1960 to 1970 the prison population declined from 212,953 to 196,429. The crime rate per 100,000 inhabitants doubled to 3,984.5.  <br>

		<p>Imagine if you were a rather dumb, lazy person.  Your house is a dump and you lack the smarts or gumption to improve it.  You&rsquo;re miserable with your situation.  So you sneak into your neighbor&rsquo;s house because HIS house is big and clean and beautiful!  HE can manage his household.  HE&rsquo;S smart.  Yeah, things are great where HE lives.  But you won&rsquo;t admit that he is better than you.  You won&rsquo;t admit that he can build and run and maintain a better household than you.  So you sneak in and you DEMAND that he let you stay.  You constantly remind him that he is inferior, that he cannot get along without you, that you are &#8220;enriching&#8221; him by your presence, and that he should shut up and let you take over; otherwise, he is evil.  </p>
<p>That is what is happening here!!!  Not only are &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; flooding across our border, but they are arrogant.  They flee from their own countries, while refusing to even admit that our country is better.  And we&rsquo;re letting them do it!  Many Americans are ENCOURAGING them to do it!  The rest of us, we send &#8220;funny&#8221; emails back and forth about how annoying it is to &#8220;press one for English,&#8221; and we keep moving to get away from them, and that&rsquo;s all we do about it.  In the so-called &#8220;land of the free and home of the brave&#8221;!  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m telling you, it&rsquo;s not to be borne!  We can&rsquo;t go on like this.  We MUST do something.  If we citizens have to boot them out ourselves, one by one, it must be done.  Who cares if they call us racist?  They will, anyway.  These people must be ejected from our country, without delay, without apology.  It simply must be done.  NOW.</p>

<p>This is an interesting take.  The old man previously lived in a mostly white area where I grew up, in my teen years, but has since become predominately Hispanic.  This is an area of Central Florida.  One day he was walking to speak to his neighbor in order to ask them to turn down their car stereo blasting taco-bender music for the world to hear.  But he looked around and realized that he was the gringo in his neighborhood, and decided it was over.  He sold the place and moved to north Florida in a mostly rural white neighborhood with plenty of land.  South and central Florida are a lost cause for whites.  </p>

		<p>What really upsets me is that white Americans are expected to give up their homeland to people who already have a homeland of their own. The latinos are invading our country. Many enter illegally. I see no reason for we white Americans to celebrate our demise. Furthermore, my experience with them has been that they can be racist. If they continue to get into positions of power, they WILL continue the practice of disempowering the white man. We white Americans won&rsquo;t have civil rights laws to protect us. We better figure our a way to fight back peacefully  &mdash;  and fast!</p>

<p>Slightly more seriously, the actual American renaissance can be loosely dated from Pearl Harbor to the assassination of JFK. It&rsquo;s long gone, in other words, with scant evidence of an imminent comeback. I&rsquo;m perplexed why your site is named &#8220;American Renaissance,&#8221; unless it&rsquo;s meant ironically.

		<p>You gotta&rsquo; hand it to Ruben. He tries as hard as Luis Guiterrez, and all the rest of the pro-illegals to make us think Mexico is doing us a favor by sending their invaders. Does he really think we don&rsquo;t mind having American jobs taken? Overcrowded classrooms of non-English speakers? Long waits in emergency rooms so illegals can sail through while we have to fill out dozens of forms and PAY (just happened recently), try to protect ourselves and our childen from the child molesters, rapists, drunk driving illegals and all the ills brought by those who&rsquo;ve sneaked into ou country? What happened to the &#8220;macho&#8221; image that Mexico loves to project? They are cowards who run when they kill an innocent person while driving drunk. When they molest/rape children, they shrug and say, &#8220;it&rsquo;s okay in our country.&#8221; They give fake names, stolen IDs and false papers when the traitors hire them. They leave a corrupt, terrorist country, then come here and demand that we accept their language and culture as well as demanding that we give more and more. They don&rsquo;t try to improve their own country, and can&rsquo;t wait to leave, but they want to bring it with them. All this shows the night and day difference of the true immigrants of old and the illegal aliens of today. We don&rsquo;t need them Ruben. Out country is built, everyting is grown or manufactured overseas (thanks to past adminstration), so please go home, get a backbone and fight for your own countries.</p>

		<p>Our retreat and retrenchment into White-dominated enclaves, as some Amrenners suggest, is not workable in itself, because the New World Order would ultimately  force us at gunpoint to accept immigration from the 3rd world FUSA ( former USA). And the enforcer would, of course, be our very own US military! No, methinks the solution is multitiered. Weaken the overbearing Federal behemoth (which would also be a good thing economically), and pass AZ like laws but much tougher. Set up ACORN like organizations, staffed with our activists, to help reestablish our values in communities, schools, MSMs, and local and state governments. Establish checkpoints at state lines, so as to ferret out illegals (look for them in hospitals and schools and churches, too). Ban Islam and return to an immigration policy based on ethnicity and culture. Strip of citizenship immigrants who have patently violated their Oath of Allegience. Do not confer full citizen rights on immigrants for some decades. End birthright citizenship. Force employers to fire and not hire illegals. Abolish all public multilingual signage and &#8216;press 1 for English&rsquo; type nonsense. Employ the so-called &#8216;Sailer strategy&rsquo; by inducing various non-White minorities to side with us rather than establish nation-within-nation blocks (this should be doable e.g. with Asian groups). Divide and conquer! Start these processes in socalled &#8216;red&rsquo; states. Then move up the oppression food-chain, taking over more states and electorally forcing the Dem party (and like-minded Republicans) to either adapt or perish. Reduce the ability of liberal courts to frustrate the will of the people. Move back towards less populism and direct democracy and more republicanism in our form of goverment; e.g. senators and electoral college reps can be appointed by state officials, which are in turn directly elected.<br>

		<p>Professor Helen let me explain a few things to you.</p>
<p>First off America didn&rsquo;t begin at the siege of Yorktown  it began in 1607 at Jamestown colony.</p>
<p>White British people were here on the ground fighting Indians, Frenchman, Spaniards, Dutchman and building a country for 169 years before the Declaration of Independence was even issued. </p>
<p>The first naturalization law of the United States passed in 1790 limited citizenship to &ldquo;free white persons.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Do you know who the President was who signed that bill into law Ms. Professor?</p>
<p>It was &ldquo;our great George Washington&rdquo; who you were just lionizing above. </p>
<p>So I guess he thought &ldquo;pigmentation&rdquo; was important.</p>
<p>Well then again not really because unlike yourself he realized that race is not mere skin color.</p>
<p>The designation &ldquo;white&rdquo; and &ldquo;black&rdquo; for the European and African racial groups uses the first most obvious visual characteristic of, skin color, as shorthand to designate these two separate ancestral population groups.<br>
Skin color is one trait, there is also hair texture, nose shape, skull shapes, etc. Also there are on average intelligence and behavioral differences.</p>
<p>None of this should surprise us because race is after all ancestry. All Europeans are more closely related to each other than they are to any African or North American Indian.</p>
<p>So that we have been a majority white English speaking country from 1607 to right now when I&rsquo;m typing this message hardly denotes a temporary feature in the history of our country. These are integral parts of this nation&rsquo;s identity which the loss of would represent the death of the nation and the rise of a bastardized empire.</p>
<p>Also while we are grateful of course for the assistance of the French fleet and any financial contributions from anyone else in support of our revolution this in no way makes the United States part of Latin America or France.</p>
<p>Please remember this revolution was a war for America&rsquo;s independence and if that meant independence from the United Kingdom you better damn well believe it means independence from France, Spanish speaking countries and anybody else in the world.</p>
<p>If you think the fact that some Cuban Governor gave us some money back in the day makes us subjects now to brown Mexican Indians then you&rsquo;re nuts.</p>
<p>If my choice was between living under the Union Jack and saying &ldquo;Long live the Queen&rdquo; or living under the Mexican Tricolor saying &ldquo;Viva La Raza&rdquo; then give me &ldquo;Long live the Queen&rdquo; forever.</p>

<p>Exactly.  If that were so, then there would be no need for Amren!</p>
<p>It is precisely because those fields   &mdash;   and ALL of our major institutions   &mdash;   have been taken over by alien interests hostile to our own (the Long March Through the Institutions) that we find ourselves now powerless, though still numerous and technically still a majority.

<p>Great post. I want to add a few more things. The reclamation of lost Native Born White American territory will require  cordon sanitaire policy. At least half the state of California-and probably all of Texas-should be cordoned off and left to rot,rot and rot some more&hellip;the  the point where these areas are unbearable for human life and any other life forms. In other words, allow ecological collapse to occur. When millions of our fellow Native Born White Americans see the hellish nightmare the passage of the 1965 Immigration Refrom Act has caused, there will be uncompromising Native Born White American Patriot movement in full-bloom.</p>

<p>AmRen&rsquo;s (obviously sarcastic) subhead to this article: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;Whites should relax and enjoy it.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>As someone who has lived in &gt;90% mestizo area of California, I tell you this without fear of contradiction: regardless of whether Whites decide to &#8220;relax&#8221; or not in the face of the Reconquista, I can guarantee them they will NOT enjoy it. </p>
<p>You will NOT enjoy being completely surrounded by foreign peasants with too many kids and too little English. You will NOT enjoy being woken up by mariachi music blasted at concert-hall volumes when your little brown brothers from the south stumble home drunk from the cantina at 3am. You will NOT enjoy seeing the house across from you hosting cockfights on the dirty, junk-filled patch of dirt they call a backyard. You will NOT enjoy being yelled at and physically threatened   &mdash;   <i>en espanol, naturamente</i>   &mdash;   over a parking spot on your street. </p>
<p>You can accept this hispanicization, or you can fight it   &mdash;   but either way, I promise you that words like &#8220;relax&#8221; and &#8220;enjoy&#8221; will be the furthest thing from your mind. </p>

		<p>Not sure exactly what your objection is Ben.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not aware of anyone who has all the genetic and physiological traits of European man with the single exception of not having white skin. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a package deal, it all sort of comes together. </p>
<p>The only point is race is not skin color by itself, it&rsquo;s very much more than that.</p>
<p>If white skin BY ITSELF was the only decider of race then African Albinos would be &ldquo;white people&rdquo;</p>
<p><br>
(Picture of African Albion) <a href="https://goo.gl/5LXLj" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/5LXLj</a></p>
<p><br>
Or this Japanese girl whose skin is as white or whiter than most Europeans would be a &ldquo;white person&rdquo;</p>
<p>(pale skinned Japanese girl)  https://goo.gl/RXMlv</p>
<p>Of course this is not what anyone has ever meant when saying &ldquo;white person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Race is ancestry and a collection of traits. Not a single isolated one. </p>
<p>If one doesn&rsquo;t understand such distinctions the &ldquo;race doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; dissimulators will tie him in intellectual knots.</p>

There would be more pollution, more traffic congestion, and less of everything good to go around.<br>
 <br>
One can explain the relationship between population and standard of living with an equation:<br>
 <br>
(level of technology x amount of natural resources) / population = standard of living. </p>

		<p><i>The Census Bureau predicts that 1 out of 4 people in the US will be Hispanic by mid-century, which is twice the current ratio.</i></p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not.  Currently, 16 or 17% of the population are Hispanic. </p>
