			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Flash News Today, March 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Until a few weeks ago, the immigrant transfer center on this tiny Mediterranean island  &mdash;  a kind of Italian Ellis Island  &mdash;  was empty. An extensive European campaign against migration from Africa was considered so effective that the authorities basically shut it down.</p>
<p>But since the Tunisian government collapsed in January, spurring unrest across North Africa, Lampedusa has been bustling. The Italian police tow in boats full of desperate immigrants  &mdash;  about 6,000 refugees in the past two months. Young men in hooded jackets smoke cigarettes and await transfer to the mainland  &mdash;  a prospect that is striking fear in many European hearts.</p>
<p>The turmoil in Libya and elsewhere in the region has toppled or undermined North African dictators who negotiated a web of benefits from Europe, including aid and diplomatic standing, in return for stopping immigrants seeking to cross the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Without the assistance of those leaders, many in Europe worry that they will face new waves of illegal immigration not only from the liberated areas in the north, but from much of sub-Saharan Africa as well.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;In Italy, there is really a panic,&#8221; said Anna Triandafyllidou, a migration expert with the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy. &#8220;Everything is up in the air, and no one knows what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unable to build the kind of border fence that the United States has erected to keep Mexicans at home, countries like Spain and Italy have spent years forging close relationships with North African leaders, persuading them to prevent migrants from trying to sail the rough seas of the Mediterranean. In return, Morocco, Tunisia and particularly Libya sometimes used brutal tactics to keep immigrants from ever getting near European shores, human rights activists say.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s agreement with Libya, signed in 2008, was considered especially effective. Italy pledged $5 billion over 20 years in exchange for Libya&rsquo;s blocking would-be immigrants from leaving. Almost overnight immigrants stopped arriving in Lampedusa.</p>
<p>According to the Italian Interior Ministry, in 2008, more than 36,000 immigrants came ashore in Italy  &mdash;  not only from North Africa, but from the Horn of Africa, Niger and Nigeria. After the treaty, that number dropped to 9,500 in 2009 and slowed to a relative trickle in Lampedusa.</p>
<p>Now, detained migrants once again outnumber the island&rsquo;s local population of 6,000, according to the ministry. At 3 a.m. on Wednesday, an Italian police boat arrived with 55 tired and shivering immigrants who had been pulled from a rickety boat. Many were wrapped in thermal blankets. One was taken away on a stretcher.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s arrangement with Libya was hardly the only one. Spain, too, has over the years enlisted the help of Morocco and other African countries in dealing with immigrants. Experts say it has offered countries equipment for patrolling shorelines and economic aid of all sorts  &mdash;  so that immigrants have fewer reasons to leave and African governments have more reason to help.</p>
<p>Spain offered Senegal money to help repatriate immigrants who were often returned to the Dakar airport but did not have the money or the incentive to return to their villages. At times, the European Union pays for such projects, too.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But the agreements have been effective. In the past year, control of the African coastline was so tight that immigrants were turning to a wholly different route, showing up on the land border between Greece and Turkey. In recent weeks, Italian officials have warned of a &#8220;biblical exodus&#8221; in which as many as 300,000 could arrive, though many experts say that number is intended more as a way to stir up passions domestically than as a reflection of any clear reality.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

I would say that violence may become neccessary, against such hordes of illegals. </p>

		<p>I spent two years living in Germany. Before I moved there, I conjured up an image of leiderhosen, knockwurst, castles with spires, and when I got to Frankfurt there were African moslems in shawls, Turkish men trying to sell me hash, and white teens with minds so saturated with MTV-styled pop culture that it was safe to say that I and any other foreign tourist were more interested in their culture than they were.</p>
<p>When I went to Dublin it was the same thing. Sure there were pubs dedicated to Brendan Behan and bookstores dedicated to Joyce, but the urban center was crowded with African and Asian immigrants. Now is our chance to see if Italy decides to go the way of all flesh. Either maintain an identity it took thousands of years to develop and be labelled &#8220;fascists&#8221; by those with an agenda, or surrender to multiculturalism like Scandinavia and Britian, receive a gold star for tolerance from the international equivalent of the SPLC, and watch your nation slowly collapse.</p>
<p>Frankly, I would rather be called &#8220;racist,&#8221; than a &#8220;minority&#8221; in the land built by my forefathers.</p>

		<p>Well Quadafi lets Saharan Africans to pour into his country in the first place. The serve as shock troops to kill his own Arab/Berber people and serve as cheap labor. While there might be an influx of Aficans to Italy if he falls, I could just as easily see mass pogroms against the African invaders by the new Arab leaders of Libya. </p>
<p>At this point it looks like the resistance is being ground up by Tanks and Ariel bombardment.</p>

		<p>If Italy did what any country should do when be invaded, that is defend itself, there would be &#8220;outrage&#8221; from the UN and EU, but what could either actually do?  Would the UN invade Italy? No.  And what would the EU do?  Expel Italy? Italy is a major member of the EU and any explusion of Italy would result in the disintegration of the EU.  Mass deportations of illegal aliens along with a few sunken ships would send a message that Italy was no longer going to lay down and die.  And the death of the EU might not be such a bad thing.</p>

		<p>I love the &#8221; migration expert&#8221;- &#8221; Nobody knows what to do.&#8221;<br>
Really? How about not letting the boats land. How about escorting the boats back to their point of origin. The European masses should be worried. <br>
But ultimately, this crisis is necessary, because a slow trickle over many decades allows native Europeans to be lulled to sleep. A large scale mass migration will force European leaders to take real action, or face immediate and dire consequences.</p>

		<p>A naval blockade of the Tunisian shoreline would be a simple matter for the NATO alliance. </p>
<p>The U.S. Sixth Fleet, headquarterd in Naples, Italy, consists of approximately 40 ships, 175 aircraft and 21,000 people. </p>
<p>It is part of Standing Naval Force Mediterranean (STANAVFORMED)which has destroyers and frigates provided by Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>STANAVFORMED is part of NATO&rsquo;s Immediate Reaction Forces (IRFs) and as such, its primary mission is to deploy rapidly to areas of tension and crisis. By definition as an IRF, the Task Force is trained to conduct a wide-range of maritime operations. It is ready to respond to any crisis in NATO&rsquo;s area of interest, although its primary area of operations is &#8220;the Mediterranean&#8221;. </p>
<p>So I ask, where is the fleet?</p>

<p>Libya, according  to  Gaddafi  himself, is  30%  black  population.  This  indigenous  population  is  found  among  the  Touaregs  and  Toubou  who  live  in  the  vast  area  of  Libya  known as  the  Fezzan.</p>
<p>Libya  was  cobbled  together  from 3  distinct  regions  in  the  1930s and  the  Africans  who live  just  outside the imposed colonial  borders  of  Libya  just  have  no  patience  with  such  travel  and  movement  impediments.  Malians  and  Chadians  and  others  just  cross  over  as  they  see  fit.  Gaddafi  embraces  Pan-Africanism  so  he  tacitly  agrees  with  them.</p>

		<p>The Italian navy is not doing its responsibilities in detaining and stopping the influx now overwhelming the nation. With the possibilities available by modern technology there is no excuse for this illegal break down the door to take place at all. <br>
But is it really the Italians fault or is there a gentleman&rsquo;s agreement here allowing all this to take place?<br>
Who gains by the influx of these multitudes?<br>
Is this to the advantage of a few who see cheap labor arriving by the boat load? <br>
If the authorities genuinely wanted to stop the influx it could be done but there does not seem to be a will. Actually it would seem this invasion by the Africans is being deliberately orchestrated to allow the entering of millions of foreigners to Europe to provide for a replacement to the aging population of many European countries that are in the midst of declining number of inhabitants due to extremely low birth-rates.<br>
To live in Europe today means you cannot afford to have children. The politicians have a remedy for declining populations which includes massive migration such as we are witnessing today.<br>

At the same time we are somehow unable to set up naval patrols along the Barbary coast in order to discourage/sink invasion vessels heading to the shores of the old continent.</p>

<p>As distasteful as it may sound to <i>bien-pensant</i> Westerners of a globalist egalitarian bent, a human flood of Third Worlders floating toward Italy   &mdash;   and therefore all of Europe, Britain, and Ireland   &mdash;   MUST be stopped by any means necessary. The first 10 or 12 &#8220;refugee&#8221; boats should be turned around and sent back south to Mother Africa with the warning to others that this will NOT be tolerated. </p>
<p>If the Libyans and/or Africans insist on sending more after that, any future boats need   &mdash;   yes, NEED   &mdash;   to be sunk. Blow holes in their hulls, and scoop up (and return to Africa) whatever survivors you can. As for the rest of them? Let their &#8220;immigration destination&#8221; be Davey Jones&rsquo; Locker. </p>
<p>Yes, the UN and the EU and even the Obama White House will squawk. But the people of Europe will cheer. </p>
<p>Time for the Italian Navy to adopt what I call the &#8220;Boom-Boom Glug-Glug Doctrine.&#8221; </p>

		<p>The genius in the Camp of the Saints story so reflects the political reality of the modern world, where we have to power defend our borders (many times over) but lack the will, disarmed by egalitarian notion that a illegitimate, polygamous African(insert Mexican here or whatever) criminal is worth the same as a ivy league educated cancer researcher.<br>
Hence the valuable cannot defend themselves from the worthless or those who create are forced to share theirs with those who destroy. <br>
This frustration and inability to externally defend ourselves, gives the left only one direction to point its animalistic defensive energies, inwards at their own brothers and sisters, committing national suicide for complete strangers, in every sense of the word.<br>
On the subject of &lsquo;Human rights&rsquo;, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was not approved by the United Nations until 10 December 1948. Yet most refugee producing nations did not even join the UN until roughly the 1960&rsquo;s onwards.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_United_Nations_membership#1960s" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_in_United_Nations_membership#1960s</a><br>
So this notion of &lsquo;Human rights&rsquo; that is so effectively wielded against us in terms of being to defend our own countries, were in no way created in any part by the people who benefit from them the most. Their sense of entitlement to our lands does not originate from rights forged from their own wills, no these humanitarian rights were handed to them on a silver platter by a idealistic, altruistic and naïve collection of &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; countries (insert conspiracy theory here).<br>
 To another point, if we were all &lsquo;equal&rsquo; in 1945 when the UN was formed, when the world&rsquo;s population was 2.3 billion people. <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population_estimates</a> <br>
Does that mean that since we&rsquo;re now at 6.8 billion people, an increase of 195% over 66 years ( or where 1 person once stood, 2.9 people now stand), does that mean as individuals we&rsquo;re only worth about a 1/3 of what we were worth 66 years ago?<br>
This universal equality business means that as a people, we are depreciating fast!<br>
Equality means that the highest descends, and the lowest is elevated. Now what political ideology does that sound like? <br>
At some point we are going to lose what we have, if we don&rsquo;t/can&rsquo;t defend it.<br>
But who wants to step out of line alone. The working class doesn&rsquo;t have the credibility and the middleclass are scared of the violent appearance of the Right wing? Something has to give. <br>
