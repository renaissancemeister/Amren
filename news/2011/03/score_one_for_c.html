<h1>Score One for Creative Casting: Tracie Thoms in <cite>Wonder Woman</cite> Series</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Arturo R. García, Racialicious, March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Nice to see the team behind the new <cite>Wonder Woman</cit> show stepping outside &#8220;traditional&#8221; bounds here  &mdash;  it was announced earlier today that Tracie Thoms would be joining the cast as Etta Candy, personal assistant to the the Amazon superhero  &mdash;  more specifically to one of her secret identities, Diana Themyscira.</p>
<p>So far, reaction on Twitter has been positive, although you just knew somebody was gonna attempt to troll it up, and sure enough, here&rsquo;s a comment from the thread at DC Women Kicking Ass:<blockquote>wow they went from morbidly obese fat woman in the 40s and 50s, to the pudgey blond woman in the current (well formly current) series some random woman who looked like etta in the animated movie to this current woman? I&rsquo;ve seen her in a horror movie before and she was killed and she&rsquo;s blk this is going to cause a bit of backlash in the fandom world<br>
</blockquote>{snip}</p>
<p>While writing my Chromatic Casting wish-list for the show, I expressed the hope that this version of the Etta character would, if the series indeed makes it off the ground, eventually hew closer to the version of Etta written by Gail Simone during her critically-acclaimed run on the <cite>Wonder Woman</cite> comic-book: not just an employee and ally of Diana&rsquo;s, but a soldier and hero in her own right. {snip}</p>

		<p>The 5&rsquo;11&#8221; Adrianne Palicki is definatley tall enough for WW, but is no Lynda Carter.<br>
I did, however, expect the island&rsquo;s Amazons to be pretty diverse.<br>
Tracie Thom&rsquo;s role sounds like it&rsquo;s just a minority quota role. Let&rsquo;s hope she&rsquo;s not portrayed as the competent &#8220;Kato&#8221; type who has to bail WW out of trouble all the time.</p>

		<p>I haven&rsquo;t kept up with the comic book series in years but Etta Candy was always portrayed as a slightly overweight middle aged White woman.  I&rsquo;d say there were two hits against the casting director, one for the token in the clown wig and the other for giving Adrienne Palicki the role of Wonder Woman.  Maybe it&rsquo;s just a bad photo but she&rsquo;s no Lynda Carter and she has an unwholesome look about her.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter, I don&rsquo;t plan on watching the series.  It&rsquo;s not even the same character many of us knew.  DC Comics has long been on a crusade to get rid of her star spangled tights because they resemble the American flag.  First they got rid of the eagle bustier and replaced it with a &#8220;W&#8221;.  Then I saw some news article back in the summer where they&rsquo;ve completely remade her outfit into something unrecognizable.  DC Comics is anti-American to the core.</p>

		<p>Why does Wonder Woman need a non-White to validate her existence? Are people incapable of appreciating Whiteness without having non-Whites launched at us like so many grenades, screaming &#8220;I&rsquo;M HERE TOO!&#8221;</p>
<p>If non-Whites are to be recognized as gods as soon as the evil Whiteys are out of the way, why not make Wonder Woman black, and blame the inevitable crash of that message on &#8220;White supremacy&#8221;, that immortal boogeyman that no one can seem to find but is the cause of 400% of earth&rsquo;s problems?</p>
<p>Apparently Whites without non-Whites is the worst thing ever, but the reverse is the only reason the universe exists.</p>
<p>Hope the new show fails.</p>

I rarely ever watch movies anymore. Whatever story line they may have, the not-so-subtle propaganda is showing how whites and non-whites can be friends without any acknowledgment of race.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to see a white and a non-white as best friends and accept the premise. We&rsquo;re supposed to absorb this message and carry it out in our own lives.</p>
<p>After watching a Hollywood film today, I&rsquo;m supposed to say, &#8216;Gee, black people are just like me! I&rsquo;m going to go out and find my own black friend and live a race-less life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of course, the blacks in these films always &#8216;act white&rsquo; which is why blacks find them offensive; the black characters aren&rsquo;t &#8216;authentically black&rsquo;, ie. recognizable as stereotypes.</p>
<p>Hollywood adds unnecessary black side-kicks and characters for two basic reasons: 1) if there are no blacks in the film, blacks will go ballistic. 2) Hollywood wants a black cross-over demographic. If there&rsquo;s a black character, they hope blacks will pay to see the film.</p>
<p>I have news for Hollywood. Where I work, every time a film comes out, blacks are passing out bootleg copies of current run films. Blacks aren&rsquo;t paying to see movies in theaters. They&rsquo;re paying for their own bootleg copies while the films are running in theaters and not out on DVD yet.</p>

		<p>Palicki looks more like Power Girl than WW. PG is an underrated character in the DC universe that deserves her own show or movie.<br>
   WW should be played by a brunett. I would have picked Eliza Druscu or Shannon Dorety.<br>
   It seems like every show must have a non white character. Hopefully she won&rsquo;t have to do much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m scared. Tracie Thoms looks hideous. I would be afraid to watch a movie with her as one of the characters.</p>
<p>Seriously, Adrianne Palicki&rsquo;s breasts are too small to be Wonder Woman, and I thought she is suppose to have black hair.</p>

		<p>Ms. Palicki, with all her bling and ear rings on here appears to be applying for the Mrs. BA from the A Team. A guess would suggest that she has a penchant for black boyfriends. Of course, I&rsquo;ve been wrong before.</p>

		<p>Its years since I have watched much TV but I remember Wonder Woman as being remarkably attractive, everything a white American woman would like to be. Lynda Carter was a true star.</p>
<p>Looking at the picures of the replacements in the new series, absolutely awful! I don&rsquo;t think I would bother watching even if I did have the time. Make it all PC and you will end up pleasing no one.</p>

<p>Nick your right to a point.  If this were some made up TV show out of the mind of some director I wouldn&rsquo;t care.  No one would care but we&rsquo;re talking about the theft of White cultural icons here.  Granted, Etta Candy is a minor character but still I hate having diversity shoved in front of me which is why I&rsquo;m not watching it or any other contemporary shows out there. Diversity kills more than neighborhoods and schools, it&rsquo;s also killing the entertainment industry.  Help drive the knife further into the backs of these Hollywood purveyors of propaganda and social engineering by cancelling your cable or satellite dish. <br>

		<p>Well, yes, they did choose a White actress to play Wonder Woman, but she looks like she would be more at home in a cop show, portraying a tough young female police officer or something like that.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s no wonder woman. Like Jamie Bamber, who is a bit effeminate and pretty much without charisma, was no Apollo, in the recent remake of Battlestar Galactica.</p>
<p>I suppose this type of casting has something to do with the kind of values that the people in Hollywood, want to teach to young Whites, these days. I mean, male characters will often be weak, really flawed. Female characters will often be &#8220;B&#8221; types, but also confused. That seems to be the style, now.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m surprised at some of you.  If some you are reminiscing about the old 1970s TV show that was loosely based on the comic book then your in for a disappointment.  DC Comics has evolved the character into a militant feminist whose Amazon sisters escaped the oppression of &#8220;man&rsquo;s world&#8221; to live in peace and harmony on an isolated island in the Caribbean.  Sounds kind of lesbian to me. I saw the animated Justice League movie and Wonder Woman was somewhere in Southeast Asia and she had freed some captive oriental women and then killed all the men in this camp.  Then she dared Superman to stop her rampage.  I was actually shocked at her tone in this movie. Anonymous at 3:15 PM on March 10 is right.  Stop watching this mind rot, the money will only be used by the usual suspects to further their agenda against us.  It would probably be better for us if Tracy Thoms had gotten the lead, hair and all, but as it is lots of young girls will be treated to a woman who is made up to look like a wh*re, not the doey eyed innocent beauty that Lynda Carter had in the role.  I can only hope that Samuel Jackson gets to play her boyfriend Steve Trevor.   </p>
