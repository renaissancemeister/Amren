<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-national/20110303/US.Arizona.Beheading.Case/">Police: AZ Beheading Tied to Mexican Drug Cartel</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amanda Lee Myers, Comcast News, March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A man who stole drugs from a Mexican cartel was bludgeoned, stabbed and then decapitated in a suburban Phoenix apartment  &mdash;  a gruesome killing that police say was meant to send a message that anyone who betrays the traffickers will get the same treatment.</p>
<p>The horrific display of drug violence spilling over the border is believed to be the only beheading by a Mexican cartel in the United States.</p>
<p>The body of Martin Alejandro Cota-Monroy, 38, was found lying in a pool of blood Oct. 10 in a Chandler apartment, his severed head a couple of feet away.</p>
<p>Chandler police have said from the beginning that they strongly suspected it was the work of a Mexican drug cartel, but it wasn&rsquo;t clear exactly why until a police report was released Wednesday.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a message being sent: Not only are they going to kill you but they&rsquo;re going to dismember your body. And, &#8216;if you cross us, this is what happens,&rsquo;&#8221; Chandler police Detective David Ramer said Wednesday.</p>
<p>One man, Crisantos Moroyoqui, has been charged in the killing, and three others are believed to have fled to Mexico.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The police report said a rival drug cartel, the Beltran-Leyva organization, was possibly planning on killing the three men. Cota-Monroy was reporetdly a mid-level member of that drug cartel, for which his brother also worked.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Decapitations are a regular part of the drug war in Mexico as cartels fight over territory. Headless bodies have been dangled from bridges by their feet; severed heads have been sent to victims&rsquo; family members and government officials; and bags of up to 12 heads have been dropped off in high-profile locations.</p>

		<p>It just came to mind that the most frightening aspect of this story is that it is only the first of many beheadings on our soil. We will see &#8220;beheading&#8221; in the news so often that it will soon have the same shock value as seeing &#8220;tax hike&#8221;.</p>
<p>After a while, the government and the MSM will stop talking about beheadings so that we won&rsquo;t think unpleasant thoughts about Mexican illegals. If they report on it at all, they&rsquo;ll treat it the same way they treat Black on White crime now. They will do all they can to lead you to believe that it might have been White folks cutting off each others heads. It will always be a guy in black pants and a white cap that did it. That&rsquo;s all the description you need to watch out for the perp.</p>

Drug smuggling is a peril for U.S security because not enough U.S. officials have been caught.<br>
Imagine that if smugglers can slip through, so can terrorists.<br>
And if narcotics can be smuggled, so can explosives and biological and nuclear weapons.</p>

		<p>   Thomas Chittum predicted in 1996 that the violence along the Mexican border would be far worse than Vietnam, obviously he&rsquo;s right on target . Can&rsquo;t help but wonder if his other predictions are just as accurate .</p>

		<p>Ya know what, friends?  I am VERY familiar with the Mexican culture, having spent most of my life in SoCA   &mdash;   and beheading is NOT part of that culture.  I believe it comes from the Middle East, from Muslims, to be exact, in whose culture that practice is as common as camel dung.  The Mexican drug cartels are being infiltrated by jihadist Muslims, and they are practicing business as usual - for them.  The danger here, besides the obvious, is that one of these soon days a jihadist will come across the border via a Mexican drug cartel, only he&rsquo;ll be carrying a weapon of mass destruction, and he&rsquo;ll use it in San Diego or L.A.  THIS is why I think the cops and border patrol should perk up about the beheadings; they aren&rsquo;t Mexican, they&rsquo;re Muslim, and we are in a lot more danger than anybody is letting on.</p>

		<p>Of course we could undermine the drug cartels by ending the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; as we undermiend Al capone by ending the &#8220;war on alcohol&#8221;.</p>

		<p>At this point, I would be VERY surprised if hundreds of incidents like these had not happened in the US and simply been covered up by law enforcement at the demands of &#8220;homeland security&#8221;.</p>
<p>The worst, of course, is that these murders are often done ritualistically.  That is to say, those doing the killing are satanists and they think that the ritual killings will get them some advantage.  Often, cannibalism is involved.</p>
<p>A good example is the florida killing that, despite the gruesome and sensationalistic nature of the killing, got only some news coverage and then quickly disappeared off the headlines.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/08/05/20100805florida-man-drinks-blood-of-victim.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/08/05/20100805florida-man-drinks-blood-of-victim.html</a></p>
<p>How many of these incidents are going on?  Like racial crime, in general, we won&rsquo;t know until those covering it up are overthrown.</p>
<p>What I DO know is that if ever there was a white nationalist takeover of the US due to open race war, it will be these incidents that spark it (which, of course, is the reason why they are covered up so thoroughly).</p>
<p>There will come a time when outrage over what is happening is so very great that even hinting at any restraint in dealing with it will paint one as aiding and abetting the most horrific crimes.</p>
<p>One has to wonder if that is not the point.  Think about this.  How many Americans would advocate going to war in mexico with the drug cartels?  That would be few to none.  But what would happen if these horrific events were suddenly made known to people after they started to accelerate and have many white victims?  People would freak and rightly so.</p>
<p>Just don&rsquo;t forget that these people were intentionally and aggressively brought into this country, probably for that very purpose.</p>

		<p>Mr. Obama, Is this enough to get your attention? What more is it going to take? No wonder states have to take action, tell mexico&rsquo;s president to shove it and close our border then he wont have to blame everything on us, see what happens to mexico once they no longer have access to the US, they will destroy themselves</p>

		<p>Yup! The Mexican drug cartels have been sending snipers to Iran for training with the Revolutionary Guards since 2005. There&rsquo;s a definite link between the South American narcotics trade and Middle Eastern terrorism. Admiral James G. Stavridis, Commander of the U.S. Southern Command, is &#8216;responsibile for&rsquo; and reports on Latin America&hellip;narcoterrorism.</p>

		<p>   One poster makes a good point, the beheadings may be Muslim inspired . But I doubt they will target L.A., it&rsquo;s a Latino city now . The cartels would never stand for that . They will pick out an Anglo city and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be that large . Say anywhere from 15K to 100K . The casualties would be numerically horrific even in a small town . <br>
   <br>
   But let&rsquo;s face it, the liberals do not know who the enemy is even after 9-11 . They actually think that conservatives are, Janet Napolitano has said so . The Clinton&rsquo;s said so while they were in office . And that is who the FBI, the CIA and the ATF were wringing their hands over(white conservatives) when Muslim jihadist walked right in and finished the job they started on the Twin Towers in 1993 . There should have been some heads rolling in the FBI and CIA but there weren&rsquo;t . </p>
<p>   Look at what happened to the careers of Admiral Kimmel and General Short after Dec. 7, 1941 . They weren&rsquo;t really to blame but they had to take the fall . But there is someone within our government that in my opinion are just as guilty as the hi-jackers of 9-11 . Either by malice or incompetence, maybe both .<br>
  <br>
  In fact,let&rsquo;s go a step further, 9-11 could not have occurred without first the Immigration Bill of 1965 having passed . Or without the absurd government wide notion that it&rsquo;s own conservative citizens were somehow a bigger threat to America than were the Muslims .     </p>

<p>Yeah, they&rsquo;re sending a message.  The message is &#8220;We like to cut off people&rsquo;s heads.&#8221;  Bear in mind - these are the descendents of the Aztecs, who would sacrifice hundreds of people at a time, ripping their beating hearts out of their chests, and throwing the bloody corpses down the stairs of their pyramids - profane temples to their death cult Gods.  Maybe it&rsquo;s not a good idea to let &#8216;em into our country.</p>

<p>Although we should be vigilant about Muslim terrorism coming in via the southern border, I disagree with those posters who think the custom of Mexican mafia beheading their enemies necessarily shows an Islamic influence on these murderous &#8220;narcotraficantes&#8221; and other mestizo miscreants. From the ancient Aztecs to <i>Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia</i>, the tribal peoples of what we now call Latin America have many, many centuries of decapitation experience to draw from. Amerinds of the southern hemisphere need no lessons from Middle Easterners in how to get a head off a body. They&rsquo;re old pro&rsquo;s at it. </p>
