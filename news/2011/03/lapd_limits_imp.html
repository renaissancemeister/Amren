			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Joel Rubin and Ari Bloomekatz, Los Angeles Times, March 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Previously, LAPD officers at such checkpoints [sobriety checkpoints] followed stringent protocols that called for them to impound a car whenever the driver was found not to have a valid license, regardless of whether the driver had been drinking.</p>
<p>Those rules have drawn the ire of immigration advocacy groups that said they disproportionately targeted undocumented immigrants, who are not able to obtain licenses legally in nearly all U.S. states. {snip}</p>
<p>The new LAPD guidelines soften the department&rsquo;s stance somewhat. Police will be required to make an attempt to contact the registered owner of the stopped vehicle. If the owner is a licensed driver and can respond to the checkpoint in &#8220;a reasonable period of time,&#8221; the officers will release the car to him or her. If the owner is unlicensed, officers will permit another person who is a licensed driver to take the car.</p>
<p>If no one with a license is available, police will impound a vehicle. In any case, police will issue a citation to the unlicensed driver.</p>
<p>Police Chief Charlie Beck said that since he took over the department more than a year ago, the checkpoint policy had &#8220;stuck in my craw as one of the things we weren&rsquo;t doing the right way.&#8221; {snip}</p>
<p>The new rules, Beck said, were an attempt to mitigate somewhat &#8220;the current reality, which is that for a vast number of people, who are a valuable asset to our community and who have very limited resources, their ability to live and work in L.A. is severely limited by their immigration status.&#8221;</p>

		<p> Multiculturalism demands discrimination. If a persons culture encourages a person to drive drunk, without license, insurance or even common courtesy then Americans are expected to tolerate these actions.<br>
 To complain is to be labeled &#8220;racist&#8221; which then causes you to lose your job, community standing and eventually every material possession you own. <br>
 It&rsquo;s little wonder why people the world over are risking life and limb to get here. We are a society at war with ourselves and willing to destroy our country to make it better for any other nationality.</p>

<p>Thats one way of putting it. Here is another:</p>
<p>LAPD refuses to enforce the law.</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>The new rules, Beck said, were an attempt to mitigate somewhat &ldquo;the current reality, which is that for a vast number of people, who are a valuable asset to our community and who have very limited resources, their ability to live and work in L.A. is severely limited by their immigration status.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apparently Chief Beck, feels he has legislative powers, as do many leftist judges. It was always my understanding that legislators made the law, the Supreme Court interpreted the law and the police enforced the law. Guess I&rsquo;ve been mistaken. </p>

<p>And the LA area continues to cater to its own tribal factions.</p>
<p>The area will be an out of control conflagration soon, as the criminal elements and drug cartels gain more influence in the society.</p>
<p>The liberal, silly, third world policies have caused the entire state to be on the verge of financial meltdown, and those same policies will see them erupt into chaos, and it couldn&rsquo;t happen to a nicer bunch of miscreants.</p>

		<p>A similar law change was made in Miami-Dade county a couple of years ago after too many unlicensed illegals had their vehicles impounded. </p>
<p>The driver is allowed to call someone to drive the vehicle and he is issued a citation with a $250 fine. I figure they must tie the payment to the vehicle registration since they don&rsquo;t have a valid id. The driver will be back behind the wheel after they are out of sight of the LEOs.</p>
<p>With the tough driver license requirements implemented in Florida the illegals can&rsquo;t get their licenses renewed so you will have an increasing percentage of unlicensed and uninsured drivers on the road as they expire.</p>

		<p>I am pretty sure this was a CA State law enacted a few years ago that anyone stopped driving without a valid liscense would have the car they are driving impounded. The law was designed to make the roads safer by removing unqualified drivers. Of course illegal immigrants rights groups complained that it would cause the illegals to lose their cars and be unable to work and live as they would be unable to pay the fees to get their cars out of impound. Or in other words, these people intentionally commited a crime crossing the border, commit a crime by working with false or no documents, commit a crime by not paying taxes, commit a crime by driving without a liscense and insurance but the illegals are good people who should not have their cars taken away. I have to pay extra on my insurance for coverage against &#8220;uninsured motorists&#8221;. Impounding cars sounds like a good idea to me.</p>

		<p>This policy is just another example of the lawless, anti-order mindset of liberals. They deliberately defund or hamstring proper law enforcement just to prevent the obvious from being evident for all to see: Illiterate, unintelligent immigrants commit a higher proportion of crime than those in the native population.</p>

		<p>The person who had a hand in choosing Chief Beck (who is half mexican and the only reason he was picked by the way) was none other than the mayor.  His name is villaraigosa, and his only mission in life is the reconquest of the Southwest.</p>

		<p>No surprise.  With a hard-core leftist/socialist/communist mexican mayor who is loyal to Mexico, and a traitor to America, there is little else to be expected from Los Angeles.  The police chief must be in the mayor&rsquo;s pocket, or have his nose up the mayor&rsquo;s butt.</p>

		<p>One of my major Eureka! moments came at the DMV. The guy in front of me had NO documentation whatsoever. So they gave him a form to sign to that effect and processed his paperwork. They then  told me to GO HOME and get my social security card which was  already on  file becuase I needed to show it for a renewal&hellip;<br>
 So a guy that had no license, no paperwork and no history with the DMV is given the green light. Me, with a valid license, SS# on file and a thirty -five year history is refused service until I can obtain the mandatory verification paperwork. When Sam Francis coined the term anarcho-tyranny, I said, &#8220;That`s me! That`s the DMV!&#8221;&hellip;</p>

<p>Sam:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where you live but if you are in the US (or England or Australia or SA) you will not escape the conflagration as the drugs cartels and non-White criminal elements gain power and numbers everywhere.  </p>
<p>They will soon have enough numbers everywhere, as they do in California, to implement more socialism, communism and taxation to support themselves via &#8220;democracy.&#8221; 0bama is just the beginning unless high fertility non-White immigration is stopped right now, and I see no signs that it will be.</p>
<p>This will not in in tears as Mr. Brimelow claims; it will end in bloodshed, and a lot of it.</p>
<p>Soon you too will part of the &#8220;miscreant&#8221; crowd.</p>

		<p>Like many police chiefs around the nation, Chief Beck is your typical politically correct type. With his pro-illegal alien attitude, he is not fit to be involved in law enforcement.</p>
<p>How disgusting that the ethno-centric groups, who fought for this policy, are able to win on this issue. This goes to show us what our country has become: a version of Latin America.</p>
<p>Also, does this new policy apply ONLY to illegal aliens or non-whites or can we white people take advantage of this policy too? I think I know the answer!</p>

		<p>Is anyone here really surprised? California has been lost. We need to come to this realization. It is increasingly becoming Northern Mexico, and the few Whites that are left couldn&rsquo;t be happier, or are high tailing it out of there. We lost this battle, but the war to preserve White America has only begun. </p>

<p>How?  Oxymoron anyone?  Hello?  Is this thing on?</p>
<p>We -desperately- need a &#8216;new study&rsquo; which shows how having more &#8216;service&rsquo; class job openings leads to more &#8216;service&rsquo; class job populations.  Maybe people will then begin to WAKE UP.</p>

		<p>You know when the LAPD is taking their marching orders from illegal invader advocates that the reconquista is pretty much in full swing. Chief Beck is nothing but a minion for our reconquista mayor. I&rsquo;m sure the mayor is looking on, content with these most recent developments which will further aid and abet his beloved la raza. </p>

Beck is a political hack like Bratton before him.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, with a straight face and with the blessing of the mayor and illegal immigrant &#8220;rights&#8221; activists to whom he kow-tows, Beck stated:</p>
<p> <i>This is the right thing to do. There is a fairness issue here &hellip; and we&rsquo;re trying to keep the roads safe.</i></p>
<p>LA&rsquo;s idiot mayor pretending he knows what&rsquo;s in the Constitution, had the nerve to respond: </p>
<p><i>Chief Beck is a stalwart advocate for constitutional policing, who has tirelessly searched for new methods to protect the welfare and the rights of every resident of our great city.</i></p>
<p>No wonder he flunked the bar <b>four times.</b></p>
<p>Forget the  mayor, he is beyond hope, so let me help you here Charlie:</p>
<p>Lawsuits against the 30-day impound law were rejected in Federal District Court and by the liberal Ninth Circus of Appeals.</p>
<p>And with good reason:</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Unlicensed drivers have 4.9 times as many fatal crashes apiece as licensed drivers.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Californians who comply with the law are frequently victims of traffic accidents caused by unlicensed drivers. These innocent victims suffer considerable pain and property loss at the hands of people who flaunt the law.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  A high percentage of automobile accidents in which both drivers are known involve unlicensed drivers. It is likely that an even higher percentage of drivers in accidents involving hit and run drivers are unlicensed.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  States require licenses, insurance, and other measures before allowing people to drive precisely because of the need to reduce the chances of injury, and to require drivers who do injure others to pay for the damage they cause. People who violate those rules are properly denied permission to drive and are properly punished for their violations.</p>
<p>  &mdash;  Seizing the vehicles used by unlicensed drivers serves a significant governmental and public interest, namely the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of Californians&hellip;</p>
<p>Got that you supreme hypocrites?  But what should you two care about the safety of the average Californian, especially White Californians. You are both chauffeured around in comfort by private drivers,the mayor with police escorts.</p>
<p>You insist and demand that I pay a yearly, hefty car tax, carry heavy-duty, over-priced car insurance, including uninsured driver in case one of your pet uninsured illegal colonists rams into my car and/or injures me, stipulate by law that I am licensed and registered.  </p>
<p>You&rsquo;d tow my car in a heartbeat if I were caught driving without up-to-date insurance, license and registration.  </p>
<p>Obviously the law doesn&rsquo;t apply to blacks or illegal colonists, only to White Kulaks.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
