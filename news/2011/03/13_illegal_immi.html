<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Border Patrol agents recently arrested 13 illegal immigrants disguised as U.S. Marines and riding in a fake military van, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The illegal immigrants were clad in Marine uniforms when they were apprehended at the Campo Border Patrol Westbound I-8 checkpoint at 11 p.m. on March 14 near Pine Valley, Calif., border officials said. Two U.S. citizens in the van also were arrested.</p>
<p>After the suspicious white van was subjected to secondary inspection, it was determined that the driver of the vehicle and its front seat passenger were U.S. citizens who were attempting to smuggle 13 illegal immigrants into the United States. All of the vehicle&rsquo;s occupants wore U.S. Marine uniforms, reportedly emblazoned with the name &#8220;Perez.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The van used in the smuggling attempt, according to California&rsquo;s El Centro Border Intelligence Center, was a privately owned vehicle registered out of Yucca Valley, Calif., and was bearing stolen government plates that had been defaced. {snip} Further research through multiple government agencies determined that the plate belonged to a one-ton cargo van registered to the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Clad in U.S. Marine uniforms, the illegal immigrants were apprehended at the Campo Border Patrol Westbound I-8 checkpoint at 11 p.m. on March 14 near Pine Valley, Calif., according to a March 15 report by California&rsquo;s El Centro Border Intelligence Center.</p>

		<p>Why should anyone be upset that these 13 illegals donned Marine uniforms when they weren&rsquo;t really Marines?  After all, we have an entire political party in this country and half the other one that wants to pass the DREAM Act, which means they would be instant citizens upon joining the military.</p>

		<p> I bartended a long time ago for the Green Beret crowd at their favorite watering  hole. The enlisted men  came up with a gag of me getting dressed up for a surprise inspection of the other unit. I was kinda taken by the idea until the wise old seargent reminded me, &#8220;It`s called impersonating an officer and the LAST place you want to do that is on an Army base&hellip;.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Be interesting to see the backstory on this one. Is this some cartel or terrorist infiltration ploy? Or just the latest in coyote tactics. Heck, maybe these guys wanted to enlist!</p>

		<p>You can wear the uniform as long as you do not impersonate and say you are a military man. And has anyone thought there is more to this than is realized? This could involve weapons theft or such? Just an idea to toss out!</p>

		<p>This reminds me of Germans dressed as American M.P.&rsquo;s during The Battle Of The Bulge.</p>
<p>Are they here to pick tomatoes or toss grenades?</p>

		<p>I vote for Leavenworth for about 15 years! I&rsquo;m sure the only reason the last ten people in Mexico aren&rsquo;t here yet is because Obama is sorta busy with the Middle East. On second thought, maybe they could do a stretch with Sheriff Joe. Trade their military garb for pink underwear. Would love to be a fly on the wall when Joe calls the roll and 16 answer to Perez.</p>

		<p>So what else is new. Anybody who has been in the military or a cop understands it matter not who wears the uniform whether black or red as they are still anti-white subject to mistrust and mischief. </p>

		<p>The uniforms could have come from a surplus store.  But the only way they could obtain the van was if a hispanic military man provided it.</p>

		<p>One reason we need a real wall is that it makes it harder to cross both ways.  There are a lot of smugglers that immediately turn tail and run for the border if they are being pursued.  With an effective fence, it will be much easier to trap or ambush illegals entering the US whatever their business is.    </p>

		<p>The way I hear it was that the illegals did not know the year that the Marine Corps was founded. This was a dead giveaway that they were not really Marines since every Marine knows this.</p>

		<p>I suspect that with all the anchor babies serving in our military; (with an allegiance to Mexico and their raza) rounding up 12 uniforms and a van in order to smuggle in more of their brethren would be no problema.</p>
