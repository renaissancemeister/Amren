<h1>The 10 Whitest Cities in the Bay Area </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Aaron Glantz, Bay Citizen, March 24, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Marin County has a new plan to attract minorities.</p>
<p>The affluent county includes seven of the 10 whitest communities in the Bay Area, according to the latest census figures. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The draft report, released Wednesday, came in response to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development&rsquo;s determination that Marin had ../../../../__8220.css;failed to comply&#8221; with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and two other anti-discrimination statutes. </p>
<p>Marin&rsquo;s Community Development Agency recommended amending zoning regulations to ease the construction of new apartments, passing new laws requiring new developments to offer housing at below-market rates, and stepping up programs to combat discrimination by landlords and realtors.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some Marinites were skeptical.</p>
<p>In San Anselmo, a central Marin city of 12,000 that is more than 90 percent white, some residents were not crazy about the proposals.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;We need affordable housing, but there&rsquo;s not a lot of room to build it,&#8221; said Julane Chapman, a retired therapist who was getting her hair done. ../../../../__8220.css;We can&rsquo;t build in the open space,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>At Bubba&rsquo;s Diner, three doors down, businessman Marty Brenner said he thought it was silly to impose diversity on Marin.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;It started as a white vacation area, and so most of the people around here are white,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>James Lai, who runs the ethnic studies program at Santa Clara University, said Marin County remains largely white in part because it lacks community resources to attract minorities.</p>
<p>Even wealthy Asians, he said, are unlikely to move to Marin. ../../../../__8220.css;There are no Chinese-language schools, no ethnic supermarkets. Most of the jobs are in the South Bay,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lai said he believed Marin would eventually join the rest of the Bay Area in becoming ethnically mixed, but he said that for most ethnic families, the three-mile distance across the Golden Gate Bridge ../../../../__8220.css;can seem as wide as an ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Marin officials said they intend to make a go of it.</p>
<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s report bore the cumbersome title, ../../../../__8220.css;Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice.&#8221; It concurred with HUD&rsquo;s assessment that the county&rsquo;s African-American and Latino residents are clustered in two small areas  &mdash;  Marin City and the Canal Zone of San Rafael  &mdash;  while many of Marin&rsquo;s cities and towns remain more than 90 percent white. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its analysis, the county also agreed that it had built only a fraction of the low-income housing mandated by the Association of Bay Area Governments.</p>
<p>Roy Bateman, Marin&rsquo;s Community Development Director, acknowledged that neighborhood opposition had helped to limit the availability of affordable housing.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;We know there&rsquo;s neighborhood opposition to subsidized housing and that that housing is often at a greater density than the surrounding areas,&#8221; said Roy Bateman, Marin&rsquo;s community development coordinator.</p>
<p>../../../../__8220.css;It&rsquo;s difficult to know how much of that is related to density and how much of that is related to people opposing new residents moving in who are different from them,&#8221; Bateman said.</p>

		<p>While it is refreshing to see a Marin county resident saying that he wants to keep the area White, I have to also state that Marin county is one of the most liberal areas in the country. Unless you have money or an excellent job housing is out of the reach of all but the wealthiest. A few years ago I read an article about a family making 150,000 a year with tech jobs having to live in a homeless shelter until space in ../../../../__8220.css;affordable housing&#8221; opened up. This is the ../../../../__8220.css;limosine liberal&#8221; syndrome at its finest- pretend to cater to minorities until they threaten to move into your neighborhood. </p>

		<p>What nobody seems to be mentioning is the prohibitive COST of buying property in and then LIVING in Marin County.  It is for the wealthy only - it isn&rsquo;t for people who have to get up and go to work every day.  An attorney I once worked for had a gorgeous beach house in Muir Beach - but to get there you had to drive along an unpaved road that hugged a mountainside; it would be a nightmare in the rain or fog, both of which happen often there.  I don&rsquo;t think race is the issue here - it&rsquo;s MONEY, plain and simple.  I myself could not afford to live there, and I don&rsquo;t think any non-wealthy person could.</p>

		<p> You know this country is really losing its marbles when a prosperous, low-crime, mostly-White city actively seeks non-Whites to move in and upset its apple cart.</p>
<p> I suspect that Asian families   &mdash;   who tend to be achievers   &mdash;   would be the kind of non-Whites that Marin should be seeking, if it&rsquo;s determined to go out searching for them. Why would ../../../../__8220.css;Chinese-language schools&#8221; or ../../../../__8220.css;ethnic supermarkets&#8221; be required for them to move there? If they can afford a house in Marin, I suspect they can speak English pretty well already.</p>
<p> Marin will live to regret it   &mdash;   profoundly   &mdash;   if it goes the ../../../../__8220.css;affordable housing&#8221; (read: cheap housing projects certain to deteriorate into gang havens) route. The political correctness, ../../../../__8220.css;diversity&#8221; crowd can&rsquo;t stand the fact that you&rsquo;re succeeding very well without them, Marin. Beware! They&rsquo;re coming after you!</p>

		<p>I live in Fairfax.  Ha ha.  Marin is the total headquarters of the radical environmentalist movement.  Only reason they are not settig fire to car dealerships and construction sites is that they have to go to work every day.</p>
<p>The conflict boils down to who is most important, minoriteis or trees, deer and packs of dogs having the freedom to run about all day.</p>
<p>Try and get a leash law manure pickup law passed in Marin.  never, never!!!!!  Dogs are entitled to the freedom to run in packs attacking walkers, dragging garbage all over the neoghborhood, depositing manure all over, establishing their terrotorial checkpoints on streets and in general making nuisances of themselves.</p>
<p>Only time the dog lovers shut up is when the dog packs leave the deer they kill exposed.  Then there is usually some debate; dog lovers vs the deer lovers.</p>
<p>But if you have children head to Marin.  Only civilized schools in the Bay Area.  The rest are Lord of the Flies type environments.  But be prepared for a lifetime of vomit inducing liberal propaganda.</p>
<p>Here is an important tip.  Before you look, check out the type of building code the town has.  If the town has its own building code buy there.  If the town uses the California universal building code don&rsquo;t even bother to look in that town.</p>
<p>The universal building code is the lowest level of building code.  It means that the houses are built to the lowest standards possible.  Universal building code is ok for a farmer who throws up a storage shed  of leftover plywood or a highway department prefab metal snowplow shed, but a universal building code house is a lifelong nightmare because it was never built right in the first place.</p>

		<p>Lynn Woolsey (D) won this congressional district 72% to 24% last election. She is pretty crazy. We know that the Republican Party&rsquo;s base leans immigration restrictionist, and the Democrat Party&rsquo;s base leans open borders, especially the holier-than-thou SWPLs.</p>
<p>Therefore, it seems logical to me that resettlement planning for low-IQ minorities should be concentrated in rich, white, Democratic counties. These counties have the resources to give their new arrivals the rich welcome that they deserve, and have the greatest capacity to benefit from a long overdue celebration of diversity.</p>
<p>Their electorates might also learn something.</p>

		<p>I grew up in that place, Novato to be exact. We were only able to afford to live there due to the late Hamilton Air Force Base. <br>
The diversity was mainly the military families, and San Jose Middle, and Novato High had perhaps 10 blacks each. </p>
<p>If these people want to protect that area, they should seek out the person responsible for proposing low income housing in that area, and get them fired. </p>

I lived in Marin County for 20 years. Safe place except for the two clusters mentioned, Marin City and The Canal area.</p>
<p>Marin City has some of the most valuable real estate in the world. Views of the Golden Gate Bridge, 10 minutes to the city, beautiful open space and absolutely dangerous. Total no-go zone. It should have been gentrified years ago and it&rsquo;s an absolute miracle it hasn&rsquo;t been yet.</p>
<p>Why? Because Marin is also one of the most liberal counties in the country. It&rsquo;s Barbara Boxer&rsquo;s home base. It&rsquo;s hilarious that these guys are being accused of failing to comply with the &#8216;64 CRA. They love diversity.</p>
<p>And it seems now they are about to get quite a bit of it.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to see them celebrate it&hellip;<br>

		<p>Cupertino, which is one of the most expensive parts of the Bay Area is 70 percent minority-virtually all Asian. Very high test scores, no crime, and very desirable- and no liberals trying to push section 8 or ../../../../__8220.css;affordable housing on us.&#8221; <br>
Because we already have our ../../../../__8220.css;diversity&#8221;. Asians protect communities from the undesirable minorities.</p>

It&rsquo;s about time the liberal wealthy white folks who have been looking down their nose at working class whites and calling them racist while preaching the wonders of diversity are now able to taste the fruits of all that tolerance.As Reverend Wright and Malcolm X would say&#8221;the chickens have come home to roost&#8221;.Nowhere else to run and hide? All white people no matter if they are rich or poor better begin holding ground and start speaking out loud and clear about the right to freedom of association.</p>

		<p>I am glad AR picked up this story. Marin County is one of the  top counties in the state for per capita income, home ownership and property values. Clean air, recreational opportunities and abundant wildlife make this semi-rural area a nice place to live. Many of the rich and famous left the LA area to come to Marin County. It is possible to shop or dine and be able to converse with a native born American being employed at the business. When I first read this story in the local media, my first thought was ../../../../__8220.css;you have got to be kidding&#8221;. The Federal government wants to require Marin County to spend millions of dollars to bring in people who live on welfare, food stamps, etc&hellip; that live entirely off government assistance in the name of diversity. These people will not contribute to the tax base  and will use local services such as hospital emergency rooms and of course expect and demand free services. Shoplifting and other crimes will rise and property values will go down. All in the name of diversity. I wonder if the next step will be to target Chinatown in SF for having too many Chinese residents? We all know the answer to that, only white Americans need diversity according to the US government.</p>

		<p>Articles like this make me shake with anger. I just wonder if there will ever be a voice in a leadership position or MSM type that will ever say enough is enough? Enough with the attack on white people across this country. The military is too white, your neighborhood or town is too white, honors classes are too white, your schools are too white. What next? Our skin is too white? For God&rsquo;s sake, just LEAVE US ALONE! I&rsquo;m sick of hearing ../../../../__8220.css;too white&#8221; in a manner of something foul and shameful. When are WE ever going to start fighting back? Days like this make me feel there is no hope for us.</p>

		<p>I know Marin County very well.  These are without much exception, some of the most liberal, leftist, and self-righteous hypocrites, usually wealthy, but not always (a big post-60s element hangs on in West Marin as well as other spots like Mill Valley).  I was just in San Raphael last September and on a night when they were holding a farmers market on 4th st. (main drag).  I saw very few whites, but oodles of Hispanics.  The restaurant I was at had a very small dining room, but the few occupied tables were of white female, Asian male couples, obviously dates.  Young women in Marin chronically search for men with money.  I have a great deal of experience with that there as well.  It is a place where white liberals tend to own European cars made in Germany, are outrageously liberal, and manage to see themselves as progressives all the same, spiritually advanced, met the Dali Lama, go to the right conventions, workshops, eat the right food, support the right causes, condemn the U.S. almost everytime, (except for now, with a Leftist black president starting a war (where are all the protestors?)).  </p>
<p>Recall the story of John Walker Linh, a spoiled Marin kid who ended up in Afghanistan fighting American troops?  He was from Marin County.  Way back, many leftist Germans settled there.  This accounts somewhat for the snobbish elitism, that considers itself more hip than anywhere else on the planet.  George Lucas located Industrial Light and Magic some time back in Lucas Valley (mere coincidence), making Marin a kind of Hollywood North, with a Beverley Hills north air about it as well. Many celebrities have homes there, around in the hills.  I met some of them over the years, back before I left the state entirely. </p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s it all without a Hispanic barrio?  The Canal Zone of San Raphael has long been a trouble area with its oldest Hispanic populations going back to the time of Zoot Suits and Pachucos.  The Canal Zone and Marin City were created housing for blacks and Hispanics during WW2 and the shipbuilding activity in the Bay Area.  They have remained fairly segregated slum regions, which is remarkable given that Marin City is in between Sausalito and Mill Valley, separated only by a highway 101 and a two lane highway 1 respectively.  But from what I saw last September, things are changing fast.</p>
<p>The ongoing work to turn Marin into an ../../../../__8220.css;integrated&#8221; region is not new.  In 1984, there was an article in The College of Marin&rsquo;s school paper written by a black student from Oakland that claimed white girls had an obligation to date black men.  No protest was made.  The County always supports Jesse Jackson and his ilk and he has made a number of visits there at key points in political events.</p>
<p>Marin County whites represent the most hypocritical of all whites in the nation, perhaps world.  Materialistic and ethereally  narcissistic at once.  I take no pleasure in saying that or noting that the news in this article represents the beginning of the end for Marin as a liberal white enclave.  However, it may be the beginning of the start of a smaller, but more aware, racial realist socially conservative white Marin.  It will take some time for the hypocrites to choose.  I predict that many, as this article indicates, will either come to grips with their hypocrisy and declare themselves at last, or bury their heads in the elitism and self-righteousness as their kids come home with non-white dates and see their jewelry and other portable valuables disappearing regularly, with their children. Some may wake up, but it will more likely be an extended, ugly, little drama of white degradation and pathetic insistence of Diversity as a their strength.  And so more real estate and white genetics will be lost to non-whites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need affordable housing, but there&rsquo;s not a lot of room to build it,&rdquo; said Julane Chapman, a retired therapist who was getting her hair done. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t build in the open space,&rdquo; she said.</p>

Oakland, and San Jose; every non-white neighborhood, church, and school in the country, is doing all it can to favor people of color over whites, trying to bring in even more non-whites, and celebrate this, and get in touch with their special color and be proud of whatever non-white race they happen to be.

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to begin&hellip;</p>
<p>1) What business does the Federal Government have in determining the racial makeup of any locale?  Does Marin County not have the right to restrict land development/housing?  Of course, most Marin liberals who still desire local autonomy on such issues will remain silent and allow the Feds to bus in welfare users because this is part of the centrally planned diversity utopia they champion.  Liberalism is a mental disorder indeed.</p>
<p>2) Why doesn&rsquo;t Ms. Reed move to an area that has more blacks and latinos (since she&rsquo;s so concerned with ../../../../__8220.css;diversity&#8221;)?  She is in California; she wouldn&rsquo;t have to go far.<br>
 <br>
3) Since when did CNN report on what areas were ../../../../__8220.css;the whitest&#8221;?  Are they next going to look at ../../../../__8220.css;the blackest&#8221; or ../../../../__8220.css;the brownest&#8221; cities?  If so, will they do this with scorn toward the lack of diveristy? </p>
<p>4) The reason given for low numbers of minorities was ../../../../__8220.css;affordable housing.&#8221;  To CNN: Are you saying minorities tend to be poor?  If so, why *should* Marinites want to attract these people?  Isn&rsquo;t poverty a major determinent of crime? (Since we all know ../../../../__8220.css;race&#8221; is just a social construct)</p>
<p>5) This disproves the Rush Limbaugh-types who claim majority black areas do poorly because of ../../../../__8220.css;Democrat-run governments.&#8221;  Marin County is overwhelmingly liberal(in 2008, voters went Obama 4 to 1 over McCain), yet it has great schools, low crime, and wealth.  </p>
<p>6) How revealing.  White liberals (who no doubt champion ../../../../__8220.css;diversity&#8221;) who are rich enough don&rsquo;t live in Oakland where this diversity occurs, but in ../../../../__8220.css;the whitest part of the Bay Area.&#8221;  Also, few white liberals have the stones to tell the Feds ../../../../__8220.css;MYOB&#8221; and defend their home towns from outsiders.</p>

If the politicians want to live around more diversity, there are plenty of cities they can move to, Detroit and Camden come to mind.

<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
I take no pleasure in saying that or noting that the news in this article represents the beginning of the end for Marin as a liberal white enclave. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I suspect that the racial collapse of Marin will come like a house sliding off a cliff.  A little tilt at first but a massive slide soon thereafter, as people wake up to crashing property values and choose to get out before getting plowed under as that sliding house grinds them all the way down the hill before pancaking ontop of them, in the middle of a ghetto.</p>
<p>Rich White Liberals have always been good at looking after their wallets.  The problem is that they have Rich White Conservatives to thank for a crushed housing/lending market and not much margin to begin with.</p>
<p>WSM States are the ones that NOW need to take a heads-up view of the way things are and start to look for people -like- the people from Marin who, by virtue of leaving first, point out their true politics- as smart survivors.  Say what you need to.  Act first on what you know is really true.</p>
<p>If you want to get your Northern Exposure style advanced engineers, doctors, administrators in a small, eco-friendly, town in Montana or North Dakota or or or, then NOW is the time to start shopping it &#8216;round, via Jobzilla or direct sale type (door to door, no, I _really mean it_) interviews.</p>
<p>When the implosion of this country comes, it will be _hard and fast_.  And only those who have swallowed their pride and banded up with some valuable white neighbors will have the ability to self-sustain after the fight is finished.</p>

<p>I envy your white skin. My skin is so dark that I get mistaken for Black sometimes. I fear that one day whites will wake up and impose separation by skin color like it was in the 1950s and before. In that case, our law abiding, intelligent south Asians would be force to live among violent blacks and be eaten alive! Going back to India is not an option for me. Indians are like whites inside but unfortunately, most Americans think skin color=race.</p>

		<p>I used to live in Cupertino too. Before Asians ran us whites out of there. Cupertino is nice because whites built it when Apple s created. Asians don&rsquo;t protect communitites - they take them over after the white genius has built them. The Asian American invaders are utterly unable to create anything of value for themselves. Their only recourse is to take over what others have made. Then of course what they take over collapses and they move on to the next takeover.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is full of FOR LEASE signs since Asians have taken it over. 13 years ago when whites were running it, it was booming.</p>
<p>As for &#8216;high test scores&rsquo; everyone knows asians cheat their way through school. Perhaps that is why they&rsquo;re so bad at doing the tech jobs and keeping the economy going. Between Asian invaders and Mexicans, CA is going broke. Way to go invaders. What will you do when you have no new place to takeover?</p>

		<p>I almost can&rsquo;t believe that this CNN report is real. To me it seems like it was staged for some dystopian movie.</p>
<p>I recall that the neighborhood where I stayed during my long-term visit to the US was almost completely white. I didn&rsquo;t even know that was a bad thing (people did not complain) - do I have to reeducate myself?</p>
<p>The place was in good order, neat and clean - like the place where I live now in Germany. <br>
But alas - we have an even bigger ../../../../__8220.css;problem&#8221; here - this neighborhood is completely white.</p>
<p>We had visitors from the USA, Great Britain, France and Russia - and they apparently all were too polite to draw attention to this ../../../../__8220.css;problem&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not multicult Berlin or Cologne, but at least it&rsquo;s safe. Well, you can&rsquo;t have everything.</p>

We feel safe around Indians. In India the murder rate is 0.0344083 per 1,000 people. In the United States it is 0.042802 per 1,000 people. </p>

This is true despite the fact that in India the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is $3,400. In the United States it is $47,400. </p>

		<p>63 John Engleman: If it&rsquo;s now almost impossible to cheat on the SAT, we can thank thank the Chinese, who exploited every possibility until they were discovered and the test procedures revised.  Last time I took a test, I have to give them a fingerprint!  That&rsquo;s because a smart Chinese would take the test for one of his less gifted brethren.  They used to spread the Orientals as far apart as possible, but now they have assigned seating and different versions of the test, to prevent any old-fashioned cheating.  There was a problem of sharp Chinese taking the SAT on the east coast and alerting their confederates out west who would be taking the test a few hours later, but I suppose that&rsquo;s been taken care of too.  <br>
     And don&rsquo;t forget, the Chinese who come here are not typical of their race, they are drawn from the educated classes.  It&rsquo;s not surprising that they have higher IQs and test scores than the average American.  How would the average Chinese farmer stack up against an Iowa farm kid?  </p>

		<p>God forbid there should be a county near San Francisco where whites are still a clear majority.  I don&rsquo;t understand: isn&rsquo;t the point of diversity to have choices?  If every city, town, and county in America is as racially diverse as possible, then how is that interesting?  Every place would be the same!  How dreadfully boring.  On the other hand, if the whole nation was entirely white that wouldn&rsquo;t be right either, but I don&rsquo;t see how complete diversity is any better.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d wager a Chinese peasant is brighter than an American peasant. It&rsquo;s true for the other social classes. The white trash around here are worse than poor blacks (this is rural meth country, though).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how much Asians ../../../../__8220.css;drive out&#8221; whites. It certainly isn&rsquo;t from crime. It&rsquo;s possibly the semi-mythical white flight actually making a rare appearance.</p>

<p>Since China and meth have been brought up in the same conversation, I think to make a more valid comparison would be to ask how would the average Chinese farmer hooked on opium in 19th century China stack up to a white farmer hooked on meth in 21st century America?  The answer is, who cares.  They are as equally unproductive and too subverted to be of any use to anyone.  No society can be functional or effective when a large percentage of its population is hooked on hard drugs.</p>
