<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>From the outside, they were typical Southern Californian townhouses with bright white walls and Spanish tile roofs.</p>
<p>But inside, a new kind of international business thrived  &mdash;  maternity wards for wealthy expectant mothers from across the Pacific.</p>
<p>For a fee, Chinese women received room and board and a chance to deliver their babies in the United States and become mothers to instant U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Southern California has become a hub for this growing phenomenon, known as birthing tourism.</p>
<p>One such business was busted earlier this month when code enforcement officials from the city of San Gabriel responded to a complaint about noise and an unusual number of pregnant women in a quiet Palm Avenue neighborhood.</p>
<p>When officials went to the location, they found about 10 mothers and seven newborns living in three townhouses that had been illegally converted into maternity wards.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They had moved walls around without proper permits; they did interior work that can sometimes create unsafe environments afterward,&#8221; Davis [Jennifer Davis, community development director for the city of San Gabriel.] said. &#8220;And it&rsquo;s a business in a residential neighborhood. They are not permitted to operate there.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What irritates me is the Republican controlled US House dithering on birthright citizenship while this invasion by birth canal continues unabated. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to say that over ten percent of births are now to illegal aliens and those on temporary visas. If a bill on birthright citizenship were brought up for a vote in the house, I bet dollars to donuts it would pass. What on earth are they waiting for?! I know the Senate and Obama would probably be formidable obstacles for birthright legislation to become law, but why don&rsquo;t they at least get the ball rolling. The Democrats are never gonna end this sham in a hundred years, but the Republicans are proving themselves to be just as useless. Why even bother with the political process anymore. What a sad, pathetic society we have become.</p>

		<p>1-Anon: &#8220;The Democrats are never gonna end this sham in a hundred years, but the Republicans are proving themselves to be just as useless.&#8221;: I completely agree. What we have today in America are center-left and left-wing political parties.  On the primary issue, immigration, which is destroying America, the parties are basically the same.  They do nothing to resolve the situation, so the situation remains the same.</p>

		<p>Patience, folks! <br>
With the libs draining all the wealth out of the country to pursue utopian fantasies, devaluation of the dollar, and &#8220;progressive&#8221; strangulation of business growth, in a more few years it simply will no longer be worth it for pregnant foreigners to fly here to get US citizenship for their children. Problem solved! And who said progressives weren&rsquo;t bright?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right. But if we wait long enough, continue to do nothing and simply be patient, there will eventually be no USA to come to either. </p>
<p>And the reason will be that we waited and did nothing.</p>
<p>I think that our enemies are counting on us doing nothing. They are planning on keeping us pacified and simply out-waiting us. </p>

		<p>Most legislators are loathe to raise the birth tourism issue, because it not in the interests of corporate stakeholders.  </p>
<p>The unspoken plan to add millions of consumers to the American population.  Leftist ideology, often blamed, is merely a sideshow.</p>
<p>It is the global, billionaire commoditities speculators who are in favor of removing all fetters to the expansion of the population, just as they encourage more debt.</p>

		<p>It is time we do something to change the Constitution to state that a child is a citizen only if the parents are either green card holders or US citizens. This would stop maternity tourism in its tracks. Something has to be done. These people have no interest in our country. They want to bilk it for all they can.</p>

		<p>What is really disturbing about this case is that they were not busted for the &#8220;anchor baby&#8221; business, but simply for local zoning and construction codes.<br>

		<p>theres no need to change the constitution it already states that!!!</p>
<p>All thats needed is a proclamation law that clarifies the enforcement for violating the constitution. aka 20 years in jail for issuing a birth certificate to an illegal alien</p>
