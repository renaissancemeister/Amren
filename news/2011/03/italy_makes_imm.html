<h1><a href="https://www.wtop.com/?sid=2295616&amp;nid=">Italy Makes Immigrants Speak Italian</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frances D&rsquo;Emilio, WTOP-FM (Washington, D.C.), March,5 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Moldovan has lived here seven years as a nanny to Italian kids and caregiver to the elderly, but in order to stay she&rsquo;s had to prove her language skills by writing a postcard to an imaginary friend and answering a fictional job ad.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like a guest,&#8221; said Cojochru. She had just emerged from Beato Angelico middle school where she took a language test to comply with a new law requiring basic Italian proficiency for permanent residency permits following five years of legal residence.</p>
<p>Italy is the latest Western European country turning the screws on an expanding immigrant population by demanding language skills in exchange for work permits, or in some cases, citizenship. While enacted last year in the name of integration, these requirements also reflect anxiety that foreigners might dilute fiercely-prized national identity or even, especially in Britain&rsquo;s case, pose terror risks.</p>
<p>Some immigrant advocates worry that as harsh economic times make it harder for natives to keep jobs, such measures will become more a vehicle for intolerance than integration. Others say it&rsquo;s only natural that newcomers learn the language of their host nation, seeing it as a condition to ensure they can contribute to society.</p>
<p>So far, Italy is only giving a gentle turn to the screw. Cojochru and other test-takers described the exam as easy. No oral skills were tested.</p>
<p>In Austria, terms are tougher. There, where native speakers have been sometimes known to scold immigrant parents for not speaking proper German to their children, foreigners from outside the European Union need to prove they speak basic German within five years of receiving their first residency permit. Failure to do so can bring fines and jeopardize their right to stay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics say requiring people to speak basic German before they set foot in Austria would be an unreasonable barrier for people from poor, rural areas who can&rsquo;t afford or access German classes.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Terrorism pushed Britain to start strictly enforcing a requirement for English-language competency for prospective citizens. {snip}<br>

		<p>This is simply laughable. I guess being a functioning, contributing member of Austrian, Italian, and British society is asking too much! Immigrants need not be able to speak German, Italian, or English nor should they have any loyalty to their host nation. Preferrably they should hate us, drain our hard earned resources, and then when they get tired of using us, terrorize us in the name of their real nation (an Islamic nation). Oh, and we deserve it because we are a very evil race.</p>
<p>I think liberalism should be diagnosed as a severe mental disorder.</p>

		<p>How about zero immigration as these countries are overpopulated.<br>

		<p>Making people want to come to Italy speak the barest amount of basic Italian?  That is the worst thing I have heard in years!</p>
<p>Italians, and all countries (that are white majority), should learn how to cross the language barrier without forcing some poor person to learn how to communicate in their new host nation.</p>
<p>I have a solution to this problem that will not force any poor immigrant to learn anything.  Do not let them in.  I honestly think other countries would hate us less if we barred all nonwhite foreigners because there wouldn&rsquo;t be any stories like this.</p>

<p>Nonsense. Other than an eccentric neighbor of mine who won&rsquo;t put up with it for a second (and I&rsquo;ve seen him yell across the road telling people to speak German!) I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen this happen. The only other times I&rsquo;ve ever heard &#8220;scolding&#8221; (more like politely asking) immigrants of anything is when they walk into a shop or other quiet place and make a lot of noise, which with Turks, Asians, and even Eastern Europeans happens a lot. And 90% of the time it comes from me and even other Austrians shoot me odd looks at times (though others look like they&rsquo;d want to shake my hand).</p>
<p>The German language requirement has been made a bit tougher, that is true, but I think anyone who&rsquo;s studied a couple of years could pass without too much trouble. Though for me it&rsquo;s not even an issue of whether they know the language or not, but rather that they have no reason to be here in the first place.</p>

		<p>Most of us, at least those of us that remember the Berlin Wall, KNOW that such barriers will work VERY WELL IF, whomever builds said wall is willing to shoot to kill. Failing that willingness, any country should simply not trouble itself with any barrier at all. I believe the number of people who actually got across the Berlin Wall could be counted at less than 100, CERTAINLY less than 40 million!!!</p>

		<p>I read this article and it is CRAZY<br>
Expecting people who come into Italy to speak Italian<br>
What next expecting people who come to America to speak English?<br>
Maybe we can all just start using that afro-ebo way of communicating?</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it about effing time we did the same thing right here in the U.S.A.???  Speak English properly or go swim the Rio Grande backwards - or fly to Egypt and walk a mile to buy a camel&hellip;.</p>
