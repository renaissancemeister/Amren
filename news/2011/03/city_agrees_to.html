			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lucas Sullivan, Dayton Daily News, March 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Justice have agreed on a lower passing score for the police recruit exam after it was rejected because not enough blacks passed the exam.</p>
<p>The city lowered both written exams a combined 15 points that resulted in 258 more people passing the exam, according to a statement released Thursday by Civil Service officials. The agreement allows the city to immediately resume its plans to hire police and firefighters.</p>
<p>The original passing scores determined by Civil Service required candidates to answer 57 of 86 (66 percent) questions correctly on one portion and 73 of 102 (72 percent) on the other. The lowered benchmark requires candidates to answer 50 of 86 (58 percent) questions correctly and 64 of 102 (63 percent) of questions on the other.</p>
<p>A total of 748 people passed the exam under the new benchmarks. It is unclear the demographics of those who passed.</p>

		<p>How low can you go? In the 1970&rsquo;s when I was in high school a failing grade (F) was anything below 75%. It took an extraordinary 95% to achieve an A. I managed to achieve a few A&rsquo;s and I didn&rsquo;t get them by having the standards lowered! I resent that achievement has been replaced by political expediency. <br>
The movie &#8220;Idiocracy&#8221; is an unintended prophecy! Behold the reality!</p>

		<p>When I was a teenager I got a ticket for going 94mph.  I was driving at 65 because if I got another tickets I would of lost my license. I was on the interstate in the middle of the night when a white car wizzed by me.  Two minutes later, a black cop pulled my red car over and said I was going 94.  Because I was young I didn&rsquo;t put the two together until a few minutes after I got the ticket.  As an adult I know exactly what happened in that circumstance.  Stupid people are more confident in their assumptions.  When he heard the ding of the radar detector, he looked at it for the speed and did not look at the car, assuming that it would be the only one out there that late. When he started down the road to chase down the speeder, he stopped me, failing to take into account that maybe there could be two cars on the road and that the faster one would have surpassed me.  That is just one example of what happens when we lower the IQs of our officers. My story involved inconvenience. I am sure other peoples&rsquo; stories are much worse.  As always God help us. </p>

		<p>From the original article:</p>
<p>&#8220;The passing candidates will undergo preliminary background checks and, once that hurdle is cleared, will be subject to an oral interview. Those dates have not been determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>The background checks will also have a disparate impact on black applicants.  Will the Justice Dept. force the city to hire criminal blacks as well as incompetent ones?  </p>

		<p>If they possessed the ability, you would think Blacks would be absolutely MORTIFIED by a move like this. But alas, they will not only NOT react in that manner, but indeed, will see it as some new &#8220;civil right&#8221; or some symbolic nonsense in action. Humility and shame are unknown to these people.</p>

<p>And the dumbing down of America continues unabated in order to compensate for lack of black intelligence.</p>
<p>Doctors, lawyers, dentists, pharmacists and other professionals are suffering an influx of blacks who are not competent enough to do the work.</p>
<p>It is the power and money junkies who are behind it all.  It is their way of guaranteeing the incompetent black masses won&rsquo;t riot and jeopardize their wealth and power.  </p>
<p>They have loosed incompetents on us who are more dangerous to us than violent criminals, while the elites are locked into only the best and brightest the country has to offer.</p>
<p>The American empire is slowly sinking in the West.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;re doing it wrong.  We should instead just not worry about &#8220;passing&#8221; scores at all, while still hiring for the sake of diversity. That way, we can keep the test as difficult as we want, as compared to dumbing down the questions, and in that way we will be able to easily identify the smart recruits from the dumb ones. Even if we have to hire the dumb ones, at least we&rsquo;ll know who they are and can work to compensate, and will even be able to knowingly compensate as we move the dumb ones up into positions of leadership.  In this way, the smart ones will know just how much they are going to be screwed over as they go through their careers, and the dumb ones won&rsquo;t care anyway as long as they have a paycheck. No more worrying about whether or not someone will be able to do a given job, as we will have compensation of effort planned ahead of time, and no more law suits for discrimination as we will pay the dumb ones the standard salary and move them up based on time in service.  There - everything is above board and we all move forward&hellip; sort of. Granted, where we end up is altogether another question.</p>

		<p>Most college classes or certification tests require a 70% to pass. It seems like the social engineers have been pretty sucessfull in making sure blacks and others who have no business in a line of work are admitted. After a few embarassing incidents I thing the test scores will be quietly raised to where they should be. </p>

		<p>In the full article, it makes clear that it was pressure from the Obama Justice department which is forcing the City of Dayton to hire more non-whites. It&rsquo;s not the local liberals forcing the city to hire of unqualified non-whites, it is the federal government. What is the Conservative reaction to  this trashing of the constitution? My brief sample of Limbo radio today indicated no interest.</p>

<p>It seems like common sense to me that if you expect to be hired for a job you should you should more than basic knowledge of the job.</p>
<p>How do you read someone their Miranda Rights if you can&rsquo;t comprehend what you&rsquo;re reading?</p>
<p>What do people expect? Do they want people who either won&rsquo;t make the effort to learn enough about a job or can&rsquo;t learn enough about a job?</p>
<p>This makes a mockery of what it means to be a police officer. Truly the least competent people need apply and pass the test. The officers should be the ones making the most noise over this. After all, those that pass by the minimum and are hired will be representing all the officers. </p>
<p>Why not just pull people off the street at random and ask them to take the test. That&rsquo;s what lower standards amount to. Letting anyone without any or minimum knowledge to perform a job.</p>
<p>This is getting beyond absurd.<br>

		<p>Poster # 2: &#8220;That is just one example of what happens when we lower the IQs of our officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem with low-IQ people is that they fail at both high- and low-IQ jobs.  For example, a low-IQ busboy will break dishes, run into waiters carrying food, fail to come to work, mix up tasks, contaminate food preparation surfaces, etc.</p>
<p>I currently have a Black who works for me, who makes mistakes at every turn.  Today, he prepared a salad, then threw away all the &#8220;unused&#8221; produce!  He also left spilled water on top of a steel cabinet, which initiated rust.  Finally, he failed to push the produce box all the way into the cold room, so that the door did not shut.  Anyone with an IQ over 80 would already know not to make such mistakes.  Stupidity is a giant drain on business and economy, and that is why countries with low average IQ are failures.   As America imports millions of low-IQ Third Worlders, we will become like the Third World.</p>

		<p>Is it significant that these lower standards are aimed at blacks who want to join the Police Service? I think a police force is the very last public service that should be lowering it&rsquo;s entry standards, anywhere. </p>
<p>Look at it this way, there will be many blacks who could never pass police entry selection tests, but they will certainly love and  misuse the authority that comes from having a uniform and a gun. Then with AA they will have rapid promotion to all the top law enforcement jobs, helped along of course by AG Holder. This should be a big concern for all thinking white people.(As Chaiman Mao famously said &#8220;True power comes out of the barrel of a gun&#8221;!)</p>
<p>A lot of top crime stories from the USA make it to our TV news. Up until now it has been rather reassuring to see that the police involved are neary always white. (Just like the front line troops we see in the Afghan War news items.)For how much longer will this be the case?</p>
<p>White citizens of this world, wake up and unite before it is too late.</p>

		<p>A number of years ago they had something like 32,000 folks take the written exam for the Chi police. A passing score was 50 %! It was said that two women had gotten all 128 questions correct but would get no more consideration for hiring than someone that got only a 50 % score.</p>
<p>Nolan the head of Federation of Police openly stated his concern as to the quality of policeman being hired with a 50 % passing score.</p>

<p>The reason is that we&rsquo;re being held hostage by what is loosely termed &#8220;the Black community&#8221;. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m  a strong supporter of having police match those whom they protect. Recruit White police for predominantly White areas and Black police in predominantly Black areas. If that leads to segregation again, all the better!</p>
<p>Black police will either enforce the law in their particular jurisdiction or they they won&rsquo;t. </p>
<p>Either way we won&rsquo;t have to listen to complaints about White police brutality. </p>

		<p>Back in the 80&rsquo;s, the police in Atlanta had to pass a test in order to be considered for promotion to Lieutenant.  When a large percentage of blacks failed this test, they claimed racism.  So, the black captains, etc devised another test and blacks still failed in large percentages.  They finally said to heck with it, we&rsquo;ll just promote who we want (mostly blacks).</p>

		<p> When a constitutional Republic with vigilant citizens has morphed into a Marxist dictatorship with a dumbed down multicultural population this is to be expected.  Let&rsquo;s face it, stupid cops come in handy when you need to control a group of ignorant serfs.  Marxist governments don&rsquo;t like police who are intelligent.  The present U.S. government does not want cops with brains who really believe in the mission of protecting and serving the public  .I think our &#8220;leaders&#8221; want a bunch of dumb cops who will pander to the whim of the ruling dictator.</p>

<p>Another problem with lowering the passing score is that dumb whites will be hired before smart whites. Smart whites will be considered &#8220;over qualified,&#8221; or they will be bullied out of a job. If smart whites are hired, there will be an obvious contrast in the Police Department, and the minorities&rsquo; incompetence will stand out. We have some of the most useless white cops in my county. The only think that separates them from blacks is the color of their skin, and the sound of their voice. The local white Sheriff would not respond to multiple 911 calls that a registered sex offender, Phillip Garrido, had children living in his backyard. It took a security guard to do his job for him.</p>

		<p>Why even test? Just place an add in the paper: free gun and badge to first 40 blacks to walk through the door. No questions asked. No health screen. No credit check. In addition, you get to drive a shiny car with blue lights and loud sirens. Good luck Dayton!</p>

<p>You would think a group of people that requires the standards of someone mentally challenged would be ASHAMED of requiring Affirmative Action and other special help to get anywhere in life?</p>
<p>Even after all these years of spoon feeding them and virtually giving them jobs they are in no way qualified for, they still for the most part are dismal failures in life.<br>
I don&rsquo;t understand how anyone who is so weak on their own can look anyone in the eye and say &#8220;I am just like you??&#8221;</p>

		<p>Amazing. Lets be honest here. A lot of cops are not rocket scientits to begin with. I grew up with many guys who went on to become cops. All decent men but not very bright. If blacks couldnt pass the original test I shudder to think of what will be joining the force now? Its bad enough seeing police officers who are so fat (of which there are many) that they cant even run. But if you add to that all the obese and or tiny female cops who are virtually lost without their male back up, it is amazing there is a viable force left. I feel bad for the smart fit cops who have to pick up the slack of all their affirmative action and lowered standards counterparts. Why any white man would want to be a cop or soldier is beyond me. Not only do the powers that be hate you, but they throw you under the bus at the first minority complaint.</p>

		<p>Speaking once again as a (now cheerfully traitorous) former progressive on race, I&rsquo;m going to betray yet another secret:</p>
<p>Liberal whites have long since given up hoping that blacks will finally begin to respond to our trillion dollar social engineering experiment by improving significantly in mental ability.</p>
<p>Trust me on this, they really have given up. </p>
<p>Secretly, most white liberals hate the current system of antiwhite racist discrimination and desperately wish it would crash and burn.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they are too cowardly to admit this even to themselves.</p>
<p>As a result they have become increasingly strident and intolerant of dissent.</p>
<p>This is mainly because they are trying to convince THEMSELVES.</p>
<p>Baby steps will not help.</p>
<p>We need to take a sledgehammer to the basic premise that race and racial difference are myths.</p>

		<p>Come on guys, you&rsquo;re taking it too hard.  We all know from TV dramas and TV advertisements that blacks and white females occupy virtually all the power professions.  </p>
<p>Blacks in Dayton also watch TV and thus see the real world beyond their ghettos.  So they rightly conclude that the police test is nothing more than a &#8220;cracka trick to keep da black man down&#8221;. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be too hard on old A.G. Holder either. Like his boss, he&rsquo;s dumb as rock. And we must give Holder a small break, after all &#8220;he just be lookin out fo his peeps&#8221;, as he recently told a congressional committee. </p>
<p>But I do wonder about why the DOJ moved on Dayton OH when we all know that only racists exist in the South, which to this day is still under reconstruction law. </p>
<p>Maybe Holder took a page from the toady Obama suck-up Bill O&rsquo;Reilly. A few years back in the &#8220;All Spam Zone&#8221; on the Foxie network, O&rsquo;Reilly merely designated Cleveland OH as a southern city.  </p>
<p>When Cleveland was having black protests (AKA riots) over white cops mistreating (arresting for crimes) black men, O&rsquo;Reilly said that &#8220;we all know that Cleveland is really a southern city&#8221;, thus the white cops were racists. </p>
<p>I really hope that some of the white boys and girls who proudly voted for old hope and change got <b>Affirmative Actioned</b> out by Dufus Holder.     </p>

We make up 70% of the population, but only account for only a small fraction of NBA players.&#8221; I have a possible solution.White men can&rsquo;t jump and it is unfair for black players to have an advantage.When a white player gets within scoring distance from the hoop it should be automatically lowered about a foot.When the basket gets lowered for the white man it will then be a level playing field.</p>

		<p>Many police departments specifically will NOT hire people who are very intelligent.  This is a matter of policy; they fear that the more intelligent ones will become bored with their jobs and quit, thus wasting all the training resources spent on them.  What they seek is those of average intelligence.  Of course, in their quest for more blacks, they&rsquo;ll get less than average recruits.</p>

Are you sure those &#8220;mistakes&#8221; are not intentional? I&rsquo;ve read of purposeful sabotage designed to look like accidents (incompetence rather than malice) perpetrated by blacks as revenge for&hellip;whatever.</p>

		<p>Look on the positive side.  This will likely be an &#8220;eye opening&#8221; experience for the whites and asians who get the shaft.  As our culture sinks deeper and deepter into this swamp, more and more will wake up.  Injustice is a mighty powerful motivator.  It should be our primary duty, at present, to make sure that the victims of this injustice know that they are not alone.</p>
<p>Remember Xenophon&rsquo;s Anabasis, where a relatively small army of whites outclassed a large army of Persians.  </p>
<p>(By the way, during classical times, the Greeks were a largely blond-haired, blue-eyed people.  Look at the modern Greek people, and you will see the results of a foolish immigration policy.  The greatness of Greek philosophy, science and culture gradually faded away with the intermixing with lesser people.)</p>
<p>My point is that we do not need to be a majority to defeat the evil elements within society.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&rsquo;m surprised that Holder&rsquo;s Justice Department did not demand out-and-out lower requirements for just blacks.  Most American universities already have lower admittance standards for blacks.  Whites have to meet much higher requirements to get into most universities.  (Asians have to meet even higher requirements than whites.)  </p>
<p>Hmmmm.  Given the obvious attitude of our liberal, leftist universities regarding black academic underachievement, is it really so surprising that Obama is the first modern president not to release his academic records? </p>

		<p>The ability to get 50s on aptitude tests but still get hired and promoted will be the next civil right.</p>
<p>Soon enough every community will have its very own Officer Dontavious Washington. Sure, he got a 58 and a 63 on the aptitude tests but he brings so much diversity to the force.</p>

<p>So much for law enforcement and &#8220;the rule of law&#8221; which has been a mainstay in america for centuries. just look at any african country and there &#8220;law enforcement&#8221; and you will see this in america. very scary indeed that the mentally incompetent have become the majority.</p>

		<p>We&rsquo;ll have New Orleans-style police departments all over the country.  Google Antoinette Frank&hellip;black, female, incompetent, violent, psychopath.  Hired.  Then became a murderer.  It&rsquo;s really an amazing story.  The signs were all there.     </p>

		<p>@26 Good observation, whites are underrepresented in the NBA. So here&rsquo;s what we do: find a WHITE race hustler (similar to Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton) and picket outside every NBA game until the NBA is only 12-13% black. That&rsquo;s only fair, right?</p>
