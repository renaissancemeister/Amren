			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Casper Star-Tribune, March 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s Heidi Beirich will present &#8220;Fighting Hate in America&#8221; at Casper College.</p>
<p>Beirich, an expert on academic racism, nativist extremism and the white supremacist fringe of the neo-Confederate movement, is the director of research in the center&rsquo;s hate and extremism department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;After a brief decline in the mid 1990s hate groups have exploded, more than tripling in number since the mid 90s. In particular, the number of hate and extremist websites has grown,&#8221; said Erich Frankland, Casper College political science instructor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was moved to help bring in someone of Beirich&rsquo;s qualifications to speak to the community about hate crimes following the shootings in Tucson this past January. I believe that we need to work toward ending hate in this country,&#8221; said Mariko Miller, Democratic Women&rsquo;s Forum representative.</p>
<p>A reception will follow Beirich&rsquo;s presentation, which is sponsored by the Democratic Women&rsquo;s Forum, the Casper College Political Science Department and the Casper College Campus Security Office.</p>

		<p>The problem with little get-togethers like these is that &#8220;the right attitude&#8221; is already etched in stone before anybody ever gets there.  It is ass-umed that everyone present is there to play &#8220;ain&rsquo;t it awful&#8221; about the people who are anti-black and anti-Hispanic and anti-Muslim; they are blissfully ignorant of the FACT that their mere presence is in itself an expression of HATE - towards white people, whose rights are oppressed more and more as the years go by.  Is it any wonder there is a lot of growth in the so-called white supremacist groups all over the country, as the rights of white people are trampled in favor of individuals who have done nothing FOR this country?  The more of these &#8220;hate forums&#8221; that convene, the more whites are going to be forced to group together in sheer self-defense.  Do they really think we&rsquo;re going to just lay down and give up without a struggle?  Guess again&hellip;.</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8220;Beirich, an expert on academic racism, nativist extremism and the white supremacist fringe of the neo-Confederate movement, is the director of research in the center&rsquo;s hate and extremism department.&#8221;</p>
<p>What exactly does that gobbledygook mean? Who made her an expert on anything? </p>
<p>The SPLC is simply a business - it cornered the market on &#8220;hate&#8221; and now pushes out loons like this fraudulent Hatetrooper to spread the brand. She might as well be selling candy bars. Basically, if there is no rise in all these supposed hate groups then old Heidi is out of a job. She&rsquo;d call the ASPCA a hate group if it got her a forum and a speaking fee.</p>
<p>Besides, the article comes across like the speaker is from some respected government agency when she&rsquo;s just a tool for a private franchise. Why can&rsquo;t AmRen stop the gross misrepresentation of hacks like Beirich from poisoning the media?</p>
<p>Lastly, the article adds:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was moved to help bring in someone of Beirich&rsquo;s qualifications to speak to the community about hate crimes&hellip;I believe that we need to work toward ending hate in this country,&rsquo; said Mariko Miller, Democratic Women&rsquo;s Forum representative.

<p>This is nothing more than a political, leftist windbag shindig. </p>
<p>It should not even be news.</p>

		<p>The increase in &#8220;hate groups&#8221; counted by the SPLC was achieved by including the following as hate groups:</p>
<p>1.  Any organization or web site against illegal immigration.</p>
<p>2.  Any organization or web site against homosexual marriage.</p>
<p>3.  Any organization or web site opposed to Obama&rsquo;s policies.<br>
    (Note:  opposition to Bush&rsquo;s policies was not hate.)</p>
<p>Fully 75% of the American population now belongs to a &#8220;hate group&#8221; by the new, expanded definition.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Fighting Hate in America&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Left likes to tell us that &#8216;hate&rsquo; comes from ignorance, for me, my &#8216;hate&rsquo; (I prefer the word frustration) comes from lack of choice in terms of swaying or deciding outcomes.<br>
 <br>
Whenever opinion polls ask the general populations of White countries whether they are pro or anti-immigration, the results are always around 75% against. <br>
And call me a racist, but I prefer migrants from English speaking countries too, who happen to look like me.<br>
So why is it in ever White country that I&rsquo;ve ever lived, politicians only ever mention immigration as an issue six months before an election and then never again?</p>
<p>If the voting public were given the choice to vote in a referendum or ballot proposition sort of a manor on the makeup of our communities via issues such immigration enforcement etc. I am sure that a lot of this so called &#8216;hate&rsquo; would dissipate.</p>
<p>What I hate is these so called morally superior types, who tell us how to live, how to think, how to feel and that there is no choice or we have no control on the way things are going.<br>
While they give away that which is not theirs and then they don&rsquo;t even &#8220;walk the walk&#8221; themselves by choosing to live far away from what they themselves are promoting.<br>
Democracy only works if you get to vote on the right issues, otherwise what&rsquo;s the point?</p>

<p>And yet there&rsquo;s not a single white united student group on any campus anywhere in the country, including at Casper U. The number of non-white interest groups and unity groups on campus (or associated) in this country must number in in the 10&rsquo;s of thousands, if there are not over 100,000 of them. It&rsquo;s all part of the &#8216;fight against hate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>When has it been determined that the Arizona shooter was some kind of conservative?</p>

		<p>This is what the long march through the institutions looks like. The agents are obvious enough, but I like the personal angles. See how Heidi will be instructing the campus security. What about? Maybe what kinds of suspicious behavior to watch out for, such as students talking about AmRen. The resulting interogations will provide a teaching moment for the students about proper beliefs. This is the old nip-it-in-the-bud strategy: Don&rsquo;t let the modern white movement get a foothold in the college.</p>

		<p> &#8220;Beirich&rsquo;s qualifications&#8221;?  <br>
WHAT QUALIFICATIONS?  She and her sleazy bosses&rsquo; (Dees and Potok) bullying tactics at the criminal SPLC?  They might as well get black supremacist Daryll Jenkins and that self hating ignoramus Michael Behrle as guest speakers and as &#8220;reliable sources&#8221; to back up their claims.  That would fully complete the Comedy Act they&rsquo;re putting on.<br>
I&rsquo;ll have to get that Michael Savage piece back up when he was toasting Mark Pokok.  He hit the nail on the head concerning that thuggish SPLC trash, and is (that I know of) one of the few white, mainstream conservatives who has shined some light on this Communist front.  Of course, I&rsquo;ve also heard that Savage went spineless when Mr. Taylor tried to fully bring him on board, so I lost a lot of respect for him for that.  <br>
Jared Taylor SHOULD be in the mainstream as well, as his points are never refuted, only declared &#8220;racist&#8221; by Leftists who can&rsquo;t prove otherwise (which I guess explains why he is not allowed in the Mainstream).  God bless you, Mr. Taylor, for being one of the few genuine spokesmen we have. <br>

		<p>It would be a lot easier for these people to &#8220;fight hate&#8221; if blacks did not reinforce negative perceptions of themselves generation after generation. Because blacks do, those who claim to fight hate need to suppress the expression of legitimate grievances. Racial egalitarians can only control the discussion by maintaining an atmosphere of fear and thought control. </p>

<p>A worshipful media that keeps shoving the microphone in the faces of Bierich, Morris Sleeze, and Mark Botox.  A fawning media that allows them to pontificate at will without a word of rebuttal from Jared Taylor, Peter Brimelow, Kevin MacDonald or any other HATER that the unchallenged masters of the $PLC smear and ruin at every opportunity.</p>
<p><br>
<i>Are there really that many naive fools in this country?</i></p>
<p>Naive or brainwashed, take your pick; and their numbers are increasing.</p>
<p><i>Why can&rsquo;t AmRen stop the gross misrepresentation of hacks like Beirich from poisoning the media?</i></p>
<p>Dream on.  </p>
<p>Groups/individuals that DO NOT promote Hate:</p>
<p>1) Nation of Islam<br>
2) Black Panthers<br>
3) La Raza<br>
4) ACORN<br>
5) Code Pink<br>
6) Gay Mafia<br>
7) C.A.I.R<br>
8) SEUI<br>
9) Bill Ayers</p>
<p>Unless the media soviet it broken up and pounded into dust, Beirich and others of her ilk will have the national media podium, dictating from on high what is isn&rsquo;t &#8220;hate&#8221;, pushing relentlessly for hate speech laws with life-destroying consequences, able to call the shots as to which organizations promote HATE.</p>
<p>Until whites come out of their eternal slumber, organize along racial lines, realize who their enemy is, and are determined to assert their rights we are doomed.  Maybe as another poster mentioned, it will happen when the new nonwhite government starts hunting us down and killing us off, just as in the old the old soviet empire.</p>
