<h1>Black Refs Unhappy to Be Left Out</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Juan Perez Jr., Omaha World-Herald, March 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A lack of diversity among referees chosen for this year&rsquo;s state high school basketball tournaments has a group of black refs, community members and politicians crying foul.</p>
<p>&#8220;The numbers don&rsquo;t lie,&#8221; said Chanell Hickey, a 10-year officiating veteran who said he&rsquo;s never been selected to work a state tournament.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t want to call it racism, but I just don&rsquo;t know what else to call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They argue:</p>
<p>» Roughly 150 referees were eligible to work the boys and girls state basketball tournaments, and nearly half were chosen.</p>
<p>» But of the 22 eligible refs who are black, only two were selected.</p>
<p>Both of the black referees were assigned to this week&rsquo;s boys tournament. No black referees were chosen for the recently completed girls tournament.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s difficult for me right now to respond to the concern,&#8221; [Steve Shanahan, interim director of the Nebraska School Activities Association] said. But he said the NSAA was willing to listen to any concerns and would consider suggestions to improve the student and fan experience.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An invitation to officiate the state&rsquo;s top-flight athletic tournaments is a big honor. The black refs say their concerns are about more than just personal pride, however. They said they feel the racial disparity mars the spirit of fairness at the heart of amateur sports.</p>
<p>They question the NSAA vetting procedures, saying that it is difficult to learn how referees are selected or rejected to serve in state tournaments. They said the unknowns of the selection process can feed perceptions of bias against minority candidates.</p>
<p>Plus, if an all-white officiating crew calls a game between a predominantly white team and a predominantly black team, they say, questions about fairness can arise in the bleachers and on the bench.</p>
<p>Four of the eight Class A teams in this year&rsquo;s boys tournament are predominantly black.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The color of a referee&rsquo;s skin shouldn&rsquo;t matter, Lee [Thomas Lee, head coach of Omaha Central&rsquo;s girls team] said. &#8220;But, unfortunately, it does.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Actually, the interracial problems vis-a-vis refs usually come with black refs giving the &#8220;gimme&#8221; call in favor of the black player or team and calling the foul on the white player or team.  I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve seen that, but I wish I had a nickel for every time I did.</p>

<p>I think I know what to call it - its called &#8220;NOT QUALIFIED&#8221; its called &#8220;HAVING A RACIAL CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER&#8221;! Does that pretty much unlock the mystery &#8220;Chanell&#8221;?</p>
<p>No black referees were chosen for the recently completed girls tournament.</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder why? ( see rape statistics )</p>
<p>Plus, if an all-white officiating crew calls a game between a predominantly white team and a predominantly black team, they say, questions about fairness can arise in the bleachers and on the bench.</p>
<p>Then doesn&rsquo;t it make sense to have White teams play against just White teams and blacks play against just black teams to eliminate any &#8220;questions of fairness&#8221;?</p>
<p>The color of a referee&rsquo;s skin shouldn&rsquo;t matter, Lee [Thomas Lee, head coach of Omaha Central&rsquo;s girls team] said. </p>
<p>EXACTLY! - only the qualified were selected, thats why there were few blacks chosen.     </p>

<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t mind the referees. They&rsquo;ve gotta find SOMETHING for white people to do in basketball!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I could not ref a game with a significant number of black players: what passes for ball handling among blacks is just palming.  What passes for a drive to the basket often involves that extra step.  All these things look great, and please the crowd, but it&rsquo;s not basketball.  The key to beating a black team is a solid zone defense, which, not too surprisingly, is illegal in the NBA.   </p>

		<p>This is why it is impossible to strive for &#8220;racial equality.&#8221;  In a part of society where blacks are over-represented and successful(sports, and in particular, basketball) blacks still find room for complaint.</p>
<p>Whites literally cannot win.  If 80% of the NBA is black players, the question becomes &#8220;why aren&rsquo;t there more black coaches?&#8221;  Then the question becomes &#8220;why aren&rsquo;t there more black referees?&#8221;  Then &#8220;why not more black owners?&#8221;</p>
<p>The best society would be one that is truly colorblind, however this is not a reality.  Blacks will not be satisfied as long as they sense weakness in white authority figures who inevitably don&rsquo;t want to disturb the apple cart and will cave into inane &#8220;demands&#8221; at will.</p>
<p>Until whites &#8220;man-up&#8221; and combat these baseless accusations with counter-attacks, it will continue until whites cannot say or do anything.  It is pathetic.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Diversity&#8221; is one of the words/phrases that I&rsquo;m totally sick of. Others are, &#8220;they only come for jobs,&#8221; &#8220;let&rsquo;s bring them out of the shadows,&#8221; &#8220;Family values don&rsquo;t stop at the Rio Grande,&#8221; &#8220;multiculturalism is our strength,&#8221; &#8220;no human is illegal,&#8221; etc. I&rsquo;m sure everyone has a favorites.</p>

		<p> It&rsquo;s obvious that the writer, a minority himself judging by his name, is trying to gin up a controversy to draw readers. The implication is, of course, that White referees will favor mostly White teams over mostly black ones, but black referees would never, ever do the same. Prove the validity of that statement, Mr. Perez. Of course, you can&rsquo;t. All you can do is try to raise suspicions in the minds of those inclined to be paranoid about things like this to start with.</p>
<p> The quotes from tournament officials (not referees, administrators) about how the choice is &#8220;pretty subjective&#8221; and &#8220;the unknowns of the selection process&#8221; are also designed to feed the suspicions of those who want to see racial bias under the bed, behind the door and in the woodpile. Your article is as one-sided as you seem to think the selection process is, Mr. Perez.</p>

		<p>Is it just me?<br>
I just can&rsquo;t figure how 12% of the population equals 50% or more of everything to the blacks? TV ads and the ads in printed media would have me believe blacks are over 50% of the population and responsible for at least 80% of all consumption.<br>
Isn&rsquo;t it time to tell these leaches to shut the h*ll up already?</p>

		<p>Thomas Lee is a Black coach.  This statement proves it &#8220;The color of a referee&rsquo;s skin shouldn&rsquo;t matter, Lee [Thomas Lee, head coach of Omaha Central&rsquo;s girls team] said. &ldquo;But, unfortunately, it does.&rdquo;  So does his picture in the original article.  Once again, if a white coach, ref, or administrator said that exact phrase his head would be on the chopping block.</p>
<p>The writer claims fairness would be an issue if you had an all white ref crew, a white team, and a black team.  Not fair for who?  The white refs would bend over backwards to ensure the game was equal if not lop-sided in favor of the blacks in fear of racism charges.  No?  I&rsquo;ve seen it, plenty.</p>
