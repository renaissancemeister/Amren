<h1><a href="http://blog.al.com/times-views/2011/03/letters_to_the_editor_huntsvil_365.html">Race Gap</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jared Taylor, Huntsville Times, March 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>On March 2, The Times wrote about Madison County Republican Hugh McInnish&rsquo;s letter noting racial disparities in Huntsville&rsquo;s schools. He cited a report by my foundation on racial differences in crime rates. The article quoted the Southern Poverty Law Center as calling it &#8220;academic racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>People make charges of &#8220;racism&#8221; when they are losing the argument. Justice Department statistics are clear: Blacks commit murder at about seven times the white rate. (http://www.popcenter.org/problems/domestic_violence/PDFs/Fox&Zawitz;_2002.pdf)</p>
<p>The department&rsquo;s National Crime Victimization Survey asks crime victims the race of perpetrators of violent crimes and finds that blacks are overrepresented as perpetrators in single-offender crimes and vastly overrepresented in multiple-offender crimes. (http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid;=942) When blacks are arrested in disproportionate numbers, it is because of the crime, not because cops are prejudiced.</p>
<p>A March 18, 2010 New York Times article on a lawsuit over a suspension notes that blacks are suspended from school at about twice the white rate. There is reason to believe that this is for the same reason blacks are seven times more likely than whites to be incarcerated: They are committing crimes at higher rates.</p>
<p>Our report, <cite>The Color of Crime,</cite> is based exclusively on official crime statistics (on the internet at nc-f.org.) </p>
<p>Mr. McInnish also noted the black/white gap in student performance. There are roughly 16,000 school districts in the U.S. and none have been able to eliminate the gap. (See NAEP 2008 Trends in Academic Progress, US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, pp. 15, 17, 35, 37).</p>

		<p>For years, the left has kept the right quiet on race issues with accusations of racism.  Leftists know they cannot win any argument on crime or academic performance because numbers do not lie.  Now, some commentators are simply acknowledging the charges or explaining that they are race realists, thus defusing any power the scream of &#8220;Racist!&#8221; has.</p>

		<p>One of the more amusing parts of being involved in statistics and mathematics is that whenever a &#8220;fact &#8221; is established it has to be re-considered if race is involved. Political correctness is built upon a foundation of lies that might easily be undermined by science. SO scientists are forced to be silent and pretend that data is faulty whenever results contradict the preordained &#8220;law.&#8221; Reality on the other hand keeps on happening and the truth becomes obvious.<br>
A dog dressed in the best of apparel, remains a dog. Science says it&rsquo;s a dog while the political correctness police search for a new name so as not to offend dogs dressed up to the nines.</p>

<p>Too, anybody that went to school with blacks and isn&rsquo;t totally blind witnessed through first hand experience black misbehavior and was often the victim of it.  Most of us don&rsquo;t need stats to reveal that blacks are serious discipline cases for schools and, later on, for prisons, jails and courts.</p>
<p>Too, it isn&rsquo;t just whites that can attest to black misconduct, every race in the country is victimized by these primitives.</p>

		<p>It takes courage to tell the truth. Nevertheless, it is time to wake up from Martin Luther King&rsquo;s dream, and acknowledge that things have not turned out as hoped for. <br>
 <br>
Are there any liberals who are not privately disappointed with black performance and behavior since the civil rights legislation was passed over forty years ago? It should not take courage to ask that question, but it does. </p>

		<p>Arthur Jensen (among others? ) has advanced this maxim:<br>
&#8220;Nothing scientific can be racist and nothing racist can be<br>
scientific&#8221; SPLC confuses (corrupts, in the medical sense of &#8220;corruption&#8221;) fact and sentiment (value).  It is a kind of P.T. Barnum maxim:  That which is unpleasant can&rsquo;t be true.<br>
 We are served well by showing how raw facts can be joined to worthy sentiments and values ( and by contrast also can be joined to malignant emotions and bad values ). Our failure to<br>
do a good job about this interface of raw facts and worthy emotions/policies/  is a failure that Dees capitalizes upon.</p>

		<p>Recently I read a professor&rsquo;s blog where he was arguing against race as a factor with regard to student test scores. While I consider myself pretty good with statistics, his arguments were over my head. What struck me, however, was his comment later in his blog where he asked those who disagreed with him why they were concerned with race. What was their motivation? </p>
<p>Even people who should know better, such as judges who see a disproportionate number of blacks in their courtrooms, are apparently unwilling to consider a racial reason for the evidence in front of their noses. Consider Judge Ned Gordon in New Hampshire: &#8220;He (Ned Gordon) said that, while a disproportionate number of abuse and neglect cases coming through the Franklin District Court appear to involve other &#8220;races&#8221; a closer look shows that it&rsquo;s due more to their economic circumstances.&#8221;</p>

		<p>There was a letter to the editor published a few years ago by the San Francisco Chronicle that was written by a police officer that stated that police do not have to racial profile. Almost always when an officer asks a crime victim to give a description of who commited the crime, the victim begins with &#8220;It was a black man, late teens to early twenties&hellip;&#8221; That is the description police get the most, so that is who the officers arrest. I believe that the writer was a black officer in the SFPD.</p>

		<p>Things have gotten bad enough that liberals who are merely &#8220;misguided&#8221; and well-intentioned should have seen the light by now. Ignorance could have been a legitimate excuse 35, 25, maybe even 15 years ago. It is not a legitimate excuse now. Our economy is in ruins, black and brown crime are rampant, and a never-ending flood of Third Worlders, Muslim and otherwise, is being pumped into America against the will of the people. How can anyone with eyes not see what is happening?</p>
<p>It is, I believe, human nature to want to think the best of everybody. However, instincts are not always right and it is our free will and ability to think independently and rationally that separates us from the animals. Millions of truly &#8220;only-misguided&#8221; ex-liberals have converted to race realism. I would say, sadly, that many, even most, of those who are STILL liberal are True Believers in the Dark (pun intended) Cause. My guess is that those white liberals who are fighting so hard for White Displacement are arrogant and delusional enough to believe that they can and will be part of the White Elite that will rule over the mocha/caramel/coffee unirace that will be the child of multiculturalism taken to its logical extreme. If they continue down that foolish and destructive path, they are going to get a very unpleasant surprise courtesy of the real White Elite, which is tiny and always will be. The inner circle of the New World Order rarely accepts new members.</p>

		<p>I am a progressive whose thinking about race has completely and totally changed over the past few years.</p>
<p>after I woke up, I realized that I have never believed the ridiculous lies that form the consensus today.</p>
<p>I began to try to discuss race issues with friends, relatives, and colleagues, most well-educated.</p>
<p>I discovered that not just educated liberals, but the vast majority of conservatives as well are unable to discuss race honestly and candidly, even with close friends, even off the record.</p>
<p>the denial of racial reality has now gone so deep that even conservatives are unable to think about race rationally in silent dialogue with themselves.</p>
<p>it is not just speech - public and private - that is being censored now, it is THOUGHT.</p>
<p>of course, everyone knows the truth, but it is easier to push it aside and continue to lie rather than to confront the bizarre reality that our society and all of its policies, from education, to immigration, to &#8220;disparate impact,&#8221; are based on an insane lie. </p>
<p>eventually, the current regime of lies about race will collapse, because it is based on absolutely nothing. </p>
<p>the key is to make it socially acceptable to speak candidly about race, which is why the censorship and intimidation is so important.</p>
<p>once it becomes socially acceptable to speak truthfully about racial difference, the current consensus will be eroded with surprising swiftness.</p>

Everyone knows they&rsquo;re dangerous and inferior. So do they. How much longer will we need to keep whispering about it in the dark? <br>
 <br>
Liberals claim to be in favor of free expression, and First Amendment rights.  They are only in favor of the free expression of blasphemy and pornography. Whenever anyone tells the truth about the biological immutability of racial and sexual differences, liberals try to destroy that person&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>Liberals claim to want a dialogue on race.  They have done everything to suppress an honest discussion of the problems members of one race cause everywhere they live. <br>

Liberals support forced school busing while sending their children to private schools.<br>

Liberals are guilty of rank, repulsive hypocrisy.  </p>

<p>I had an acquaintance about 10 years ago who was a former school teacher. She was then homeschooling her children. She told me she quit her teaching job when the school administrators called her to a meeting due to the fact she was sending too many black students for discipline. She was advised that, &#8220;she needed to learn the difference between bad behavior and black behavior.&#8221; This meeting ended her teaching career. Imagine how many teachers suffer in silence due to &#8220;black behavior.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The reason The Bell Curve arouses such hatred and anger is because it is so plausible. <br>

Although - or perhaps because - I am a Christian I admire the Jews. If someone wrote a book claiming that the Jews tended to be of below average intelligence, and that the reason was genetic I would not get angry. I would wonder what planet the guy lived on. </p>

		<p>The practice of shouting down opponents in a discussion on any subject because the other side is winning the arguments with facts and figures is called &#8220;ad hominem&#8221; and is taught to all Liberals and especially the Far Left as it works if the person being subjected to the abuse of AH gives in. I have been subjected to it at times especially once on a TV-talk programme in South Africa where while I was giving an opinion, on air, on the death penalty I had a young black &#8220;thug&#8221; who was shouting at me from a couple of feet away,  Knowing the microphone was a close proximity one where it only picks up in this case my voice I continued calmly and ignored him making him wilder. Funnily enough many of the black people, some academics, on the programme agreed with the death penalty but then as they were, under the new ex-terrorist ANC government the biggest victims, it made sense.  The secret is to ignore the abuser and continue with your argument.  It helps if you have, as I have, a loud clear voice though. I have a video of the programme shot in about 1998.</p>

<p>Dees and Botox capitalize on the fact that they can ALWAYS count on the entire, nationwide msm to pint or report nationally whatever they say as FACT and UNQUESTIONED DOGMA and label whatever Mr. Taylor or Mr. Brimelow  say or write as hate speech and racism.  How many times have we seen Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s or Brimelow&rsquo;s words prefaced by:   &#8220;The SPLC considers American Renaissance and V.Dare.com to be  Hate Sites.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not &#8220;our&#8221; failure, it is blatant and outright censorship and suppression of white speech and advocacy.  This has changed due to the Internet, of course, and more whites are becoming aware of their oppression.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s shocking about Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s above commentary is that an msm publication printed it with not only with his name on it but without a snide comment as to how Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s racist commentary in no way reflects the views of the paper&rsquo;s editorial board.  </p>

<p>Very true.  I spoke with a math teacher who is fairly bright but is unwittingly so intimidated to think freely, that he doesn&rsquo;t even realize it.  I spoke about some of the issues that are common knowledge on this site, and he seemed to acknowledge hearing it, but immediately reverted to thinking about language barrier and parent indifference to explain performance gap in current minority class composition vs. vanilla composition.  It was almost surreal to see someone who is clearly intelligent and very computer literate, function at the level of an imbecile in this one mental compartment.  Past conditioning was so complete and durable, that he is now totally impervious to obvious explanations, and probably for life. Amazing.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When blacks are arrested in disproportionate numbers, it is because of the crime, not because cops are prejudiced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cops should be prejudice.</p>
<p>To be fair, a large percentage of cops look for crime where it is likely to be found, where blacks are found.  However, their prejudice is completely justified because blacks are more inclined to commit crimes, as Jared Taylor&rsquo;s findings support.  A cop with prejudice towards blacks, has an unfavorable feeling towards them based on the FACT that they commit more crimes.  Isn&rsquo;t it justified, therefore, to be prejudice as a cop?  </p>
<p>It would be morally wrong for a cop to have feelings of prejudice to groups that didn&rsquo;t warrant it, such as, a feeling that women in brown shoes are likely to be child neglecting, drug users.  But a belief that blacks are morally inferior because they harm society with more crime is completely rational.</p>

		<p>To poster #14:</p>
<p>I taught for several years in a high school that was 30% black and 70% latino.  About 25% of the latinos behaved like the blacks (almost all dominicans).</p>
<p>But the behavior of the black students was so off the chart - I mean you cannot even fathom how wild they could be unless you&rsquo;ve taught in an urban or ghetto school.</p>
<p>A typical class period would involve the black &#8216;students&rsquo; (boys and girls) cat-calling, yelling out of nowhere, getting up suddenly and walking all around the class, throwing things, getting into arguments, etc&hellip;.</p>
<p>Many of the latino students, all recently arrived, would look at the blacks in disbelief.  The propensity for black students to get violent, for no reason at all, was unnerving.  Out of nowhere they would suddenly do a &#8216;beat down&rsquo; and form a pile of kicking and screaming bodies.  In the class, in the hall, anywhere.</p>
<p>We teachers learned that the liberal, marxist admins, both of a certain, ahem, &#8220;tribe,&#8221; ALWAYS took the side of the students.  &#8220;We are advocates of the child!&#8221; they would say, as they put a nasty letter in YOUR file.  I got out of there as soon as I could. </p>

		<p>I have to agree with poster #14&rsquo;s comments. I took a college level math class with about 30 other students. Of those were 3 black kids who acted up in each class. on more than one occasion the teacher was forced to ask them to be quiet. One of the &#8220;students&#8221; came to class late and wore his pants down at his knees. Their behavior marks them for life.</p>

		<p>Re Post #18<br>
Tee Vee is not the medium AR needs especially and the unfairness of that medium is not, I think, the crux of our problems.  In the literate medium of the written word, the task is to sort out CLEARLY how terms like &#8220;hate&#8221; and &#8220;racism&#8221; may have legitimate<br>
meaning for us and how they are stretched and overused and debased by SPLC.  Hans Eysenck&rsquo;s 1971 definition of  a racist<br>
was someone who was both (a ) in possession of the relevant facts of science and (b) and interfacing such facts with values and policies suggesting indifference or animonsity toward less favored peoples.  We need to define better what racism actually can mean and what can reasonably be suspected of being hateful vis a vis the facts of science.  We need to do it NOW.</p>

		<p>A trend in urban schools is to hire a black supt. to &#8220;straighten things out.&#8221; That happened in a school I left not long ago (thank God). I heard from someone still there that she took out the cops and security and started a new policy - discipline write-ups must be equal beteen black and white. So when black kids reach their limit, no more write-ups of black kids the rest of the year. Sheesh! </p>

		<p>As per THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS from 1976-2005 29,437 whites were killed by blacks (AT LEAST I&rsquo;D SAY!), and no less than 11,262 blacks were killed by whites&hellip; Thats a 18,175 white deficit due black on white killing compared to the reverse and subtracting the two numbers&hellip;  I&rsquo;m sure if you control for motive, intent, self-defense, etc&hellip; then this will degenerate into even further disgust&hellip;  Whats amazingly sick about reporting this is how the horribly brain washed PC libs actually try to turn this on you or be dismissive and even try to create all kinds of excuses&hellip; I should know, i&rsquo;ve spread this stat around MANY times&hellip; Can you make a better case for segregation than these kind of stats?!, which only get far worse when you add to the time line and include many other crimes, especially compared to the reverse cross racial crimes of white on black which are always a small fraction of the reverse.</p>
