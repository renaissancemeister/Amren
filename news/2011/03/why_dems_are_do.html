<h1>Why Dems Are Doing Worse in Some States than Others: It&rsquo;s Race, Not the Economy</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lee Drutman, Progressive Fix, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>In 2008, Democrats enjoyed a solid advantage in partisan identification. By 2010, that advantage had largely evaporated. As I detailed in a previous post, in every state, the Democratic partisan ID advantage has declined, and by an average of nine percentage points.</p>
<p>But the decline has not been equal across the nation. In fact, there is a good deal of variation in the change in Democratic identification across states, ranging from a ranging from a drop of 22.2 percent in New Hampshire (from +13.2% to -9.0%) to a drop of just 1.6 percent in Mississippi (see <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Dem-party_ID.jpg">this table</a> for state-by-state numbers).</p>
<p>Why should these changes vary so much from state to state? Are there demographics that might explain this?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the only statistically significant predictor of the decline in democratic partisan affiliation advantage is the percentage of white people in the state. Surprisingly, the state economy (at least as measured by unemployment rate or change in unemployment rate) doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><strong>Whites</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we come to the share of white voters. Here we have a consistent pattern, and one that is statistically significant (and explains 13 percent of the state-level variation). For every ten percent increase in white voters as a share of the electorate, the predicted decline in Democratic ID advantage is almost one full percentage point (the one outlier in the lower left is Hawaii, which is highly Asian. Without that outlier, the relationship would be even stronger).</p>
<p>This re-emphasizes the problems that Democrats seem to be having with white voters. (Democrats have not enjoyed parity with Republicans among white voters in 20 years, but 2010 was especially bad, with white voters breaking 62-to-38 for Republicans in the mid-term elections.)</p>
<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="DemocratsAndWhites.jpg" src="/news/2011/03/17/DemocratsAndWhites.jpg" width="400" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></span></p>
<p>This explains why the Democratic decline in diverse states like California (47 percent white) and Nevada (66 percent white) is less than in lily-white states like South Dakota (90 percent white) and New Hampshire (95 percent white), even though California and Nevada have much higher levels of unemployment.</p>
<p>These results exist regardless of economic circumstances (these findings are robust even in a statistical model that controls for all the other possible factors discussed).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>The brief summary of this analysis is that race may matter more than the economy for  why voters have been identifying more and more as Republicans for the last two years.</p>
<p>Of course, there are obvious caveats to this interpretation, most significantly the fact that I am playing around with state-level data, as opposed to individual-level data.</p>
<p>But the patterns are discouraging for Obama and the Democrats. Much prognostication has argued that the number one factor for 2012 will be the unemployment rate, because historically, the unemployment rate has been a very strong predictor of whether the incumbent party wins or not. This analysis suggests that something else is going on as well. Democrats are having a hard time with seniors and particularly white voters, and it&rsquo;s not just a story about the state of the economy.  Democrats ignore these scatterplots at their peril.<br>

		<p>I would check for sociopolitical bent, IQ and percentages of specific SES class levels to be sure but this is a predictable function of the elitist/herd psychology at work.</p>
<p>Being social animals, we fall in together when times are tough (lest we fall apart, alone).</p>
<p>Look at FDR and Churchill, both liberal socialists, both successful in times of great crisis because they promised everyone things would be okay.  One dead of polio complications before the war ended, the other oustered with almost astonishing abruptness, as soon as it was finished in ETO.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, one would not expect a cripple and a drunken fool to be chosen as representative &#8216;war leaders&rsquo; but for the fact that we still retain enough of the underdog attitude that we will lick the hand of anyone who makes us feel like they are like ourselves and thus it&rsquo;s okay for them to be in charge because they say it&rsquo;s okay to be (utter failures as an exercise in democracy) ourselves.</p>
<p>But now you throw at us an ethnic alien and specifically the race-as-class elevating &#8216;uppity&rsquo; behaviors from a man who has lied consistently about his post-racial attitudes and his own identity/classification within our society (&#8216;Most Open Administration Ever!&rsquo; = no birth certificate and sealed school records) and you have a big trust-in-diversity divergence problem.</p>
<p>Because now, it&rsquo;s not just that things are getting worse for all of us.  But that it looks like some of us are shoveling more sandbags for certain sections of the dyke than others.</p>
<p>I am not saying that this is not necessarily going-round-coming-round something to be unexpected from blacks more than whites (we did it to them for decades).  But for a bunch of liberal schmucks who thought that &#8216;change&rsquo; meant for the better, it is a cold glass of H2SO4 in the face.</p>
<p>And so, realizing our betrayal, we do the next best thing once the general population loyalties have failed us (or perhaps now that the situation has normalized and not everyone has seen the world slide out from under as predicted): we revert to class and likely racial identities as intragroup alternatives.  Most especially those in high-white states where islanding issues are not an issue and elitist notions of self-sustainability are not obviously &#8220;You mean you and that black/hispanic/asian guy?&#8221; hypocritical.</p>
<p>If allowed to continue in a see-saw of exploitation by class (Republican sell themselves only to the highest bidder) vs. race (Dems whore to anyone, hoping for a &#8216;majority impregnation&rsquo;), this will split America&rsquo;s social cohesion into smaller and smaller islanding norms as a kind of macro-political variation of bowling alone.</p>
<p>With a resultant, enormously destabilizing, loss of national trust and one which will cause the country to crash.  After which, we will see corporate socialism aka globalism as a seemingly &#8216;kindler, gentler&rsquo; takeover after the induced debt and betrayal psychology effect leaves us lost and vulnerable.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be (kindler or gentler).  But I have a feeling that this is all part of a slippery slope effect getting more grease.</p>
<p>It will remain so for as long as the we-the-idiots have no real control in determining who the candidates are and what they will talk about as real world goals and policies.</p>
<p>Getting to vote is not nearly as important as knowing what and who you are voting -on-.  Right now, democracy as a process is more synonymical with lottery than leadership by intent.</p>

		<p>Race and economy are not independent factors.  North Dakota has a 3.8% unemployment and it is 90% non-hispanic white.  </p>
<p>Nevada and California have the highest unemployment in the country right now at 14.2% and 12.4% respectively.   Where there are higher rates of white people, there are higher rates of employment.   </p>
<p>I consider democrats to be bad for the economy specifically because they are blatantly anti-white. </p>

		<p>Unfortunately, with RINOs such as AZ Sen. John McCommunist, OOps, I mean John McComish (voted against AZ&rsquo;s anti immigration laws), we may still have to vote for some Democrats. </p>

		<p>It is certainly true that the Democrats have lost the white vote.  Their solution to this problem is to vote in a new electorate, which is why Democrats are all in favor of mass immigration and illegal immigration.  Why should I want to vote for a party that wants to replace me with Mestizos and Haitians?  But just because the Democrats are anti-white doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Republicans are pro-white.  Most of them are just Democrats with tax cuts.  The truth is that the white middle and working classes have no place to go.</p>
<p>Most of the jobs that have been created in the past two years have gone to immigrants, legal and otherwise.  Democrats don&rsquo;t care, and too many Republicans want cheap labor.  So on the matter of jobs and the economy both parties are awful, and there is not much to choose among them.  But at least some Republicans do want to enforce immigration law while hardly any Democrats do.</p>
<p>On the matter of war and foreign policy, we have just seen proof that the people can elect the most left wing Democratic senator in the country as President and our wars still proceed as if George W. Bush was Commander in Chief.  The one man who <i>really</i> would have gotten us out of the forever wars was the man labeled by the main stream media as a &#8220;kook&#8221; and a &#8220;nut&#8221;   &mdash;   Ron Paul.</p>

		<p>Commerce Department data released today show that the share of national income going to wages and salaries in 2006 was at its lowest level on record with data going back to 1929.[1]  The share of national income captured by corporate profits, in contrast, was at its highest level on record.[2]<br>

When Bush left office after 2008, the median income had fallen to $50,303. That&rsquo;s a decline of 4.2 per cent.<br>

What recession? The millionaire population jumped in the U.S. by 8% [in 2010], fueled by the stock market recovery, according to an industry report on Wednesday.<br>

  <br>
  <br>
 <br>
By the early 1970s it was apparent that ending racial discrimination would not achieve racial equality. Rather than accept the dichotomy between equality and freedom the Democrats used Republican disarray over the Watergate Scandal to force through policies like forced school busing and affirmative action. These were not required by the civil rights legislation passed during the 1960s. They were never popular. They negatively impacted the white blue collar workers, who had been a demographic essential to Democratic electoral victories.<br>
 <br>
Unfortunately for the Democrats Watergate was not a U turn in America&rsquo;s move to the right; it was a temporary detour. The millions of Americans who had voted for Richard Nixon in 1972 and who thought he should resign in 1974 did not wish that they had voted for George McGovern earlier. They wished that they had had the opportunity to vote for a conservative Republican without Richard Nixon&rsquo;s penchant for self destruction. <br>
 <br>
In 1980 they had that opportunity with Ronald Reagan. He won. The move to the right continued. <br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, the white working class has not benefited economically from its support for the GOP. Although the economy has continued to grow since 1980 nearly all the growth has whistled past the white working class to the upper middle class and beyond. <br>
 <br>
The Democrats should address the growing income gap. They will not be able to do so until white blue collar workers trust them on racial issues. There is little support nationally for a return to discrimination against blacks. Affirmative action discriminates against white male blue collar workers.   </p>

		<p>It appears that the correlation might be even stronger if the percentage of non-black and non-Hispanic voters were used as the independent variable (that plotted on the x-axis). That would have made Hawaii less likely to be an outlier which exhibits a high degree of leverage. The effect of the high-leverage outlier is to reduce the slope of the least-squares regression line.</p>

		<p>Whenever you hear a mainstream conservative wail on about how &#8220;Democrats&#8221; are the reason cities like Detriot, New York, Washington, and Atlanta are so poorly run, ask yourself why liberal states like Minnesota, Vermont, Maine, and Rhode Island are doing okay.  Portland seems to be fine.  So does Seattle.  </p>
<p>Liberal-socialist Denmark has less crime, higher GDP per capita, and a common, peaceful culture. Now, just imagine what conservative, economically-free America could do if it were still 90% white. </p>

		<p>Whites are realizing that the democratic party supports policies antagonistic to white interests. Establishment republicans are almost as bad the democrats, hence the emergence of the Tea Party. There is an undercurrent of white self-interest in both.     </p>

		<p>This article goes by state by state overall populations and how they vote, so naturally the whiter the state, the more likely it is for Democrats to do badly. However, I can almost guarantee that if they only looked at white populations within each state, they would find that Democrats suddenly do better in the whiter states.  Why?  Because white people who are the most furthest removed from diversity are the ones dumb enough to vote for liberal policies.  </p>
<p>As a Southerner I am beyond disgusted with whites who live in Maine and Minnesota, who have the nerve to lecture those of us in the South on how we treat blacks as well as how we handle the border issue.  How dare they!?  I am so disgusted with it all!!!  </p>
<p>What if us Southerners decided to lecture Northerners on why they shouldn&rsquo;t shovel their walk ways when it snows? Or why don&rsquo;t we lecture them on how they should cut back on the heat they use in their homes during the Winter, so as not to harm the environment?  The thought in itself is downright silly isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>So why do whites in mostly white states (mostly in the North), think they can lecture the rest of us on how we handle minorities?  </p>
<p>You best not lecture somebody on something that you know absolutely nothing about.  By doing so, you can very easily ruin a particular group&rsquo;s life for the worst.  Thanks to liberal whites up in their sheltered all white communities up North, the South now has the worst schools in the country!!!!!!  It disgusts me!  </p>

If one does not know any blacks it is easy to imagine that Sidney Poitier, Oprah Winfrey, Uncle Ben, and Aunt Jemima are typical representatives of the race. It is easy to imagine that blacks are unoffensive victims of irrational color prejudice. <br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, whites with that delusion have made it virtually illegal to tell the truth. <br>
 <br>
The problem is not white racism. The problem is the black social pathology that reinforces white racism generation after generation. </p>

		<p>Blacks and Hispanics consider the Fed Govt to be the caregiver to them. They wish to consume more than they produce, hence they need the Feds to take from those who produce more than they consume and re-distribute to them. They fare poorest where they must rely upon one another! Freedom is not important which contradicts the underlying philosophy of this country.</p>
