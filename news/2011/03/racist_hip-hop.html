<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A group of white students, who some believe are from Stuyvesant High School in New York, have gotten the Internet up in arms.</p>
<p>{snip} To the surprise of some, Stuyvesant High School is considered one of the top high schools in the nation, but many are wondering what in the world they are teaching.</p>
<p>Apparently frustrated with their black classmates, the rappers use lyrics, like, &#8220;You so wack, b  &mdash; , chilling in the projects.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.You black and you so f  &mdash;   grimy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What&rsquo;cha gonna do? Call your black squad n  &mdash;  ?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stuyvestant High School is reflective of a disturbing degree of racial segregation that exists in New York City schools. Even though 70 percent of the student population in New York is black or Latino, only 2 percent of the students admitted to the school are African American, according to the New York Daily News.</p>
<p>For the seven specialized schools in the five bureaus of New York City, only 4 percent of the students admitted are black and only 6 percent are Latino. Therefore, it appears that the racism being shown by these students is a direct reflection of the very same discrimination being endorsed by school administrators.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As much as these young people should be punished for their behavior, we cannot deal with them without also addressing the administrators at Stuyvestant High school, who are seemingly determined to maintain systems that promote and endorse racial inequality.</p>
<p>{snip} I would imagine that these students are not being given a curriculum that embraces interracial respect and their behaviors are a reflection of the adults who&rsquo;ve declined to teach them to show decency toward those who are different.</p>
<p>Perhaps if their school would admit a few more black people, the kids might not feel so inclined to sound like members of the KKK.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

<p>Would you feel the same way about punishing the artists behind a rap song whose lyrics included &#8220;I want to hate and kill the (M.F.&rsquo;n) white police,&#8221;&hellip;.&#8221;(g.d&rsquo;ed) police?&#8221;  Especially since someone in St. Louis did just that.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a real mystery to me.  How can a high school be so good yet only be 2% black?  (Scratching my head)</p>

They always get it wrong.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not ignorance of blacks that fuels racial awareness, it&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>Had any of these boys never seen a black, they likely would hold the proper politically correct views.</p>

		<p>With black enrollment of only 2 percent, administrators at Stuyvestant are unquestionably among our nation&rsquo;s most accomplished segregationists.  A benighted white Southerner of rural mind, I can view only with envy the seven degrees of separation that they, my moral betters have attained.</p>

		<p>So these high achieving white kids don&rsquo;t really like blacks. In a city where blacks commit nearly 70% of all violent crimes, despite being less than 1/4th of the total population, can you really blame them?</p>

<p>Why is this news?</p>
<p>I am not directing this question at AR, but instead at the &ldquo;mainstream media!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These 4 boys have done nothing criminal (and yes, I did watch the video) they were only goofing around, as all teenaged boys do. However, unlike so many of their peers &ldquo;of color,&rdquo; they did not rape or murder those of another race or ethnicity while doing so.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is laughable to think that &ldquo;integrating&rdquo; them and their peers with more nonwhites will keep them from holding such &ldquo;racist&rdquo; attitudes. If &ldquo;only 2 percent of the students admitted to the school are African American,&rdquo; and they feel like this, just imagine what they will feel and think if that 2 percent  becomes 20 percent ?</p>
<p>This is why multiculturalism is doomed to fail, it is because no matter the level of propaganda and &ldquo;civil rights laws,&rdquo; reality always wins!</p>

The problem isnt Stuyvesant high school itself.<br>
It is the fact that the school stands out above a vast non-white population of kids whose numbers and low aptitude confront the very policies of the school and its students whose achievments are traditionally based on merit. </p>
<p>The National Education Association, and numerous politicians overseeing the laws of the state are to blame.</p>
<p>The schools nearest cafe&rsquo;s and restaurants are called Peace and Love Cafe, Locande Verde, Nobu Tribecca, and                   Bubby&rsquo;s Restaurant Bar Bakery.</p>

<p>What stood out was the comments from PaulaNYC, possibly an AMREN reader. A lot of people see the Great Emperor of Diversity and White Guilt has no clothes.</p>
<p>In this article an ethnic/racial breakdown of Stuyvesant is given:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/9ygDQ" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/9ygDQ</a></p>
<p>The student population as Stuyvesant is 71.6 percent Asian, 24.1 percent white, 2.9 percent Hispanic, and 1.2 percent black, Fox 5 reports.</p>
<p>-Not even 25% white.</p>

		<p>As a graduate (1970) of Stuyvesant H.S., I think I can speak to this article. One has to take a test to be admitted to Stuyvesant or any of the other &#8216;specialized&rsquo; high schools in N.Y.C. It is within the public school system, but stands apart as the epitome of academic achievement. If you cannot pass this test, you do not attend. If your grades fall below a certain standard, you are sent to attend your local high school. I hardly think that the students there today would be caught dead visiting this site. It was, and still is, a bastion of liberalism among N.Y.C. schools. When I attended, a majority of the students were Jewish. I venture a guess that the ratio is probably 50-50 Jewish and Asian today. At the time of my attendance, it was also all male. That changed in 1971, but the academic standards did not change. It is one of the few N.Y.C. H.S.&rsquo;s that have both a 100% graduation rate and 100% college admission rate. It just so happens that certain types of students do not measure up to the standards set there. To skew the racial makeup of this institution out of political correctness, or some perceived &#8216;racial imbalance&rsquo; would be a crime. </p>

		<p>The overwhelming majority of these students at one of the few elite New York City public schools are Asians and whites of Jewish background. The lyrics they chose were meant to be a parody of rap music, but the reality is that most of the rap lyrics nowadays are not much different than the parody the students were trying to create with their version. So how can these fairly gross, words, likely sung by Jewish students, be considered demeaning towards the black youth sub-culture of &#8220;gangsta rap&#8221; and what-have-you?</p>

		<p>As for this author and many other black purveyors of public opinion: they don&rsquo;t want to be around ghetto blacks any more than whites do.  They simply milk the plight of low-class minorities in order to make a living.  <br>
You notice here there&rsquo;s also a blame-the-teachers meme.  According to the left, if it&rsquo;s not &#8220;bad&#8221; schools (i.e. majority black or brown), it&rsquo;s always &#8220;bad&#8221; teachers who are responsible for failing black students.  </p>

		<p>Integration is absolutely necessary for Stuyvesant. The (mostly white liberal) students at Stuyvesant High need to have some firsthand experience with blacks, to inform their decisions when they make up a large part of the political elite. So many problems are caused by the fact that the white upper class doesn&rsquo;t interact with black and brown people on a daily basis. I&rsquo;m sure that the diverse experiences that their children will have with some black and brown students will be truly eye-opening, both for the kiddies themselves, and for the parents.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;m laughing so hard all I can do is cut &amp; paste. Just New York City? And just schools? Do you live under the Geico rock?? People WANT to be segregated! They CHOOSE that on their own. With all the freedom to intermingle constitutionally protected, they still CHOOSE their own people. Look everywhere you go - blacks line up at black cashier&rsquo;s registers, they group together on buses, in waiting rooms, in classes; everywhere people go they CHOOSE their own.</p>

		<p>Yup, see AmRen, October 27, 2010.  And the intent was to replace the statue with one of MLK, the new one being more &#8220;relevant&#8221; to the black students.  </p>
<p>Jersey City authorities intervened and the Stuyvesant statue is supposed to be re-erected in the very near future.</p>

		<p>I used to post on here regularly (i.e. a LOT), but after saying everything you can POSSIBLY say and not only does nothing change, but gets worse, what more can you say anymore?</p>
<p>However, since I graduated Stuyvesant in 1965, I posted this under the original article and I thought I&rsquo;d repeat it here. I could&rsquo;ve written thousands of words, but I kept it short, because I know nobody over there would care:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>For the seven specialized schools in the five BUREAUS of New York City, only 4 percent of the students admitted are black and only 6 percent are Latino.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;BUREAUS&rsquo;?! REALLY?! Good going Mr. Ph.D. Try &#8216;BOROUGHS&rsquo;. I graduated Stuy in &#8216;65, before all your special rights, affirmative action, quotas, ad infinitum, kicked in. We had black kids in our class. (Look in the Indicator, which was our yearbook). You know how they got in, just like everyone else? We passed a TEST. You know how many white kids DIDN&rsquo;T get in?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no &#8216;racism&rsquo; involved. It&rsquo;s something called IQ and the Bell Curve. A large percentage of kids in Stuy back then were Jewish. Now, a large percentage are Oriental. So, if you want to play the, &#8220;I&rsquo;m the victim, race card&#8221; here, then call yourself out on being Anti-Semitic and Anti-Asian (or do Jews and Asians not count as &#8216;oppressed minorities&rsquo; in your black world?).</p>
<p>People like you are obsessed with race and &#8216;racism&rsquo;. You see racists under every bed. It&rsquo;s easier to blame &#8216;The Man&rsquo; than take personal responsibility for yourselves.</p>
<p>Btw, nice site. &#8220;BlackVoices&#8221;. Sorry to bust up your party, but this is a &#8216;White Voice&#8221; posting a comment, which you&rsquo;ll probably never print.<br>

		<p>&ldquo;Stuyvestant High School is reflective of a disturbing degree of racial segregation that exists in New York City schools&rdquo;</p>
<p>  &mdash;  -I have visited this school several times over the last few years.  I even gave a workshop to students there once.  It is majority Asian and Jewish, like another poster pointed out.  Real American euro-whites (not jewish) from what I could tell were about 10% or so of the student body.</p>
<p>The Asians are both orientals and IndoPak.</p>
<p>The author who I quoted above does not speak with accuracy.  New York is not mostly Asian and Jewish, so this school does not reflect the segregation pattern of NY.  </p>
<p>In NY blacks live in black neighborhoods and latinos, wheverever they settle, quickly push EVERYONE else out by sheer numbers.  (Look how quick they conquered most of the Bronx!  Brooklyn is next.)</p>
<p>If the above quote was accurate, then Stuyvestant would be 25% black, 30% latino, 10% asian and the rest a mix of jews and whites.  But it is a place devoid of blacks and latinos and also has very few Mayflower Americans.</p>
<p>I heard that in California there are lots of schools now where there is 100% black or 100% latino or 80%+ Asian.  Does anyone protest for the civil rights of the poor white kids who are being denied their chance to experience &#8216;diversity&rsquo;?</p>

		<p>This is such counterintuitive pretzel logic&hellip;the more White kids are exposed to blacks, the more they will be victimized by them and the more they will learn to hate them! That is the reality of the situation. Liberal social engineers delude themselves into believing that more exposure to blacks will lead to greater tolerance and love.
