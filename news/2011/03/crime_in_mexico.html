			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Chris Owen, Gadling, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is an ongoing debate about Mazatlan, Mexico. Justified or not, tourism is down. Land vacations tour operators are being cautious more than ever. Cruise lines refuse to stop due to real or perceived security issues (stabbings, drug lord bombings, no bingo). But those who live there say it is safe. Now, Cancun, Mexico, former poster-city for organized crime is saying &#8220;Hey, give US a look why don&rsquo;t ya?&#8221; as if the focus has shifted and they are in the clear now.</p>
<p>Trying to hang on to its self-proclaimed &#8220;No. 1 vacation destination in the Caribbean&#8221; title, Cancun is beefing up security reports USA Today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The safest people here are the tourists,&#8221; Erandeni Abundis of the Cancun Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau &#8220;We depend on tourism. We couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose it.&#8221; Proactive Cancun has beefed up their web site too with clear, easy to find information and believable video content.</p>
<p>Indeed, tourism is a major factor in Mexico&rsquo;s economy. Cancun alone boasts 5.9 million international visitors last year, up over 400,000 from 2009. But with tourism numbers down, rather than whining about it like Mazatlan has, Cancun is taking clear steps to send a message of safety.</p>
<p>Tourists can now dial 911 for an emergency rather than a confusing local number, uniformed customs officers with assault rifles stand watch over visitors at the airport and a dozen highly-visible &#8220;tourist advisors&#8221; greet visitors, directing them to approved airport transportation.</p>
<p>Still, news of crime in Mexico, attacks on tourists and just general worldwide unrest in the travel sector has tour operators and tourism officials working overtime to set the record straight.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While colleges are on break, the beach is not packed. Hotel occupancy at 71% this week is down from a traditional 80+% at this time of the year reports the Cancun Hotel Association.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One major travel agency in Cancun laments: &#8220;every time this comes &hellip; less tourism and it causes Cancun to die slowly.&#8221; reports 630ched.com adding &#8220;So, if you&rsquo;re dreaming of a spring break on the Mexican Caribbean but lack &#8220;mucho dinero&#8221;, you might want to cash in on Cancun&rsquo;s misfortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many have too. In defiance of a Texas Department of Safety warning to stay out of Mexico on spring break, college students are flocking to Cancun, the closest Mexico destination to the border with few problems reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&rsquo;t been beheaded,&#8221; Archer, a 26-year-old dental assistant, says with a grin. &#8220;We&rsquo;ve had no problems. People need to chill out.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Only idiots go to Mexico these days.  Like it or not, it is taking your life in your hands to go there; there IS no safety for anyone in Mexico in any city, much less the country.  Until Mexican officials wise up and go in with the army and massacre the drug cartels, as in finish them once and for all, Mexico will remain a very dangerous place for all.  Stay away if you have any brains.</p>

		<p>So what if they have more security, you need to be afraid of the cops in Mexico whether they are real cops are people impersonating cops. </p>

		<p>Any college age child who says they&rsquo;ll spend spring break in Mexico should be given an ultimatum&hellip;.stay in the US (or at least PR) or be disowned.  It is time parent&rsquo;s got tough with so called &#8220;adult children&#8221;, especially since parent&rsquo;s usually pull the purse strings.  Lay down the law.</p>

		<p>Well, just hang on, Mr. Archer, your turn will come. From time immemorial, young people (although you&rsquo;re pushing the limit at 26) have thought they were invincible. Mexico is a third world, terrorist nation and anyone with any sense needs to stay far away. How about celebrating at some of own beautiful beaches? I can recommend Gulf Shores, Al. or the beaches of Destin, FL. or many others where I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll have to worry about losing your head. By the way, are you a chaperone to the eighteen year olds? If so, you should take your charges somewhere else.</p>

<p>It sure does!  I have never seen so many White sheep who are so delusional, self-hating, and genocidal than what we have in the world today. They are the type that loves diversity until they end up in a morgue someplace. Even then they will ask God to forgive their murderer!  </p>
<p>Our &#8220;masters&#8221; sure knew that the White races (most, anyway) are prime subjects for the never ending propaganda, that we are all the same. We are from ONE race, they say. The &#8220;human&#8221; race.They sure do need to be thinned out from our gene pool and it looks like they will soon be. Problem is, those of us who are alot smarter than these sheep will also suffer at the hands of these nonwhites that they so dearly love.</p>

<p>Estimado Dolor,<br>
Quedo de acuerdo con Ud.<br>
I have friends who go to the Riviera Maya twice a year and I think they&rsquo;re crazy. <br>
I tell them that if they want Palm Trees and warm beaches, they spend their money in Florida. </p>

		<p>I think it is a Good Idea for a lot of these College Kids to head down to Mexico.<br>
I hope they don&rsquo;t find out running a big mouth doesn&rsquo;t do you as much good there as it does with your nagging mother and henpecked father. And that there are people there who will cut your heart out and hand it to you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not like being on Jerry Springer, STEVE won&rsquo;t be there to help you.<br>
Never forget kids these unfortunates you meet there are the ones who haven&rsquo;t made their way into the land of milk and honey (USA) yet so they can get a good job that Americans don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p>So Adios and have a nice time.</p>

		<p> While I haven&rsquo;t been to Cancun, I have been to Cozumel and Costa de Maya. If you stay in the tourist area, you are not going to have any problems other than your significant other buying expensive junk. I hate to see exaggerated fears keep people from visiting Mexico. If the locals lose their tourist related jobs, they&rsquo;ll come here for work or join the drug gangs. I&rsquo;m happy to support the economy of any third world nation if it reduces the migration of their people to the U.S.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if TCO/DTO (drug) organization yearly takes don&rsquo;t surpass tourism by an order of magnitude, especially on a nationwide basis, which means that while nobody is going to deliberately kill one golden goose to preserve another (drugs would -never- work if the entire system, on both sides of the border, was not completely bought out, same as immigration), if it comes to a choice between safety and suppression, the greater profit base will win.</p>
<p>One of the reasons these regional (Acapulco, Mazatlan, Cancun) touristy areas are under a virtual constant state of lockdown is because there are so many hands in the till that don&rsquo;t want the money going any further than it does already.</p>
<p>The drug traffickers occasionally get involved with this, either running their stuff through or looking, acting as a supplier for tourists or most often, to make a statement on mutualism as vulnerability.</p>
<p>But generally, there is maybe a 30-40nm ring around the major &#8216;destinations&rsquo;, where you have some trickle down SES improvement and beyond that, it&rsquo;s an economic desert.</p>
<p>Comparatively, the Drug Trafficking Organizations like the Sinaloa and La Familia move their stuff through routes that completely bisect the country on it&rsquo;s long axis and while they are not charities by any means, they know how to hand out the cash when it suits them, to buy local influence.</p>
<p>Guess who&rsquo;s going to lose in a war for the hearts and minds on that one.</p>
