<h1>Most Pastors Would Like More Racial Diversity in Their White Congregations</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Helen T. Gray, Kansas City Star (Missouri), March 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Most white pastors would like more racially diverse congregations.</p>
<p>But they understand why they aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worship style, preaching style and traditions of leadership usually cause the separation among us,&#8221; said the Rev. Bob Hill of Community Christian Church at 46th and Main streets near the Plaza.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the worship style and preaching style are huge factors for both Anglo congregations and African-American congregations,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They both cherish their traditions and don&rsquo;t want to let them go.&#8221;</p>
<p>That mirrors the views expressed by the African-American ministers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rock said most white churches are serious about integrating.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we are with Christ, it will be a multicultural experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If heaven is multicultural, our churches should be multicultural. Also, our churches should reflect the increasing multiculturalism in our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Sheffield Family Life Center in the Northeast area could be one of the more multicultural churches in the city.</p>
<p>In 2001, it was 40 percent white, 40 percent African-American and 20 percent Hispanic. Gradually the African-American attendance increased. Today the church is 70 percent African-American.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to keep it integrated,&#8221; said the Rev. George Westlake III, senior pastor. &#8220;We have been intentional to make sure that we have a mix, including in leadership of African-Americans and Hispanics at all levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of predominately white churches that don&rsquo;t have minorities lack diversity in leadership positions, and the music style does not attract minorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Sheffield does a lot of black gospel music, but also music heard in white churches. </p>
<p>Westlake thinks the main reason most churches are not integrated is because their communities are not integrated. The community surrounding Sheffield is about 75 percent nonwhite, mainly African-Americans and Hispanics, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Demographics also are a factor, said the Rev. Gail Greenwell of St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church in Mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our church has a desire for diversity, but the neighborhoods we pull from are mostly white,&#8221; she said. &#8220;God has created incredible diversity and our communities should reflect that as much as we can,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Rev. Keith Herron of Holmeswood Baptist Church, 9700 Holmes Road, said there is a mix of races in his congregation but to a lesser percentage than that of minorities in the area. He said some white churches may not be aware of latent racism in their congregations.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is subtly evident when someone &#8216;other than us&rsquo; comes to visit, and our true beliefs or ugly thoughts surface,&#8221; Herron said. &#8220;The visitor recognizes the signs, however, and knows there are some in the church who would rather they not widen their welcome with a true spirit of God&rsquo;s inclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Also, Community Christian and the predominantly African-American Swope Parkway United Christian Church share fellowship, meals and education forums several times a year, and take turns hosting Juneteenth celebrations.</p>

		<p>The black writer Chester Himes once said that there was such a thing as a white mind and a black mind. It was possible to ferret out blacks with white minds and vice versa. I&rsquo;ve watched black preachers on television, and noticed that thirty minutes or an hour into their sermons, they had still made no reference to biblical scripture. I am not religious but if I attend a service I would still like to hear the priest &#8220;stick to the script.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supposedly the black style of oratory stemmed from white Pentecostal influences. Whatever the case, the black style is more about the tone and the emotion than what is actually said. In person it might be rousing, but if you were to dry read a transcript of a sermon delivered by a black, it would be less than impressive to read. It&rsquo;s all about bypassing the intellect and catching the holy ghost.</p>

		<p>What is the duty of a Christian church, when the community from which its supporting congregation comes, is subject to a stealth invasion, as we are in California?  What would the Scriptural basis be, to rebut the calls for love and inclusion as our society and culture melts away?    </p>

		<p> Notice how those interviewed are chosen to sing all from the same hymnbook: The one that reads, &#8220;Blending the races until we&rsquo;re all beige-colored is the ultimate object; we just disagree slightly on how fast White people should disappear from the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p> OK, I&rsquo;m being facetious. But it does seem that the story would have been more interesting if they had also quoted at least a couple of pastors or other church leaders who said something like, &#8220;Of course heaven will be multi-cultural, but all the races are more comfortable worshipping mostly with their own kind here on earth. So why should we be bending over backward to change that?&#8221;</p>
<p> After all, many blacks are just as reluctant to attend White churches as Whites would be to attend black churches, and for the same reason. People who would dearly love to hasten the mixing of the races in this country tend to place way too much emphasis on &#8220;welcoming&#8221; those who are not like us in appearance, language, culture, etc.</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s not a new thing, and not necessarily just a racial thing, either. In my hometown, Irish immigrants in the first half of the 19th Century built the first Catholic church in the community. German Catholic immigrants who started arriving somewhat later at first attended that church. But they found they weren&rsquo;t comfortable there, and so eventually they built their own Catholic church, a few blocks away. To this day, many old-time Catholics in this community refer to them as &#8220;the Irish church&#8221; and &#8220;the German church.&#8221;</p>
<p> If the Sunday worship service is the &#8220;most segregated hour of the week&#8221; as so many White liberals like to bemoan, there are some very good reasons for that. Unfortunately, this article ignored or made light of all of them.</p>

		<p>This is quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>Churches reflect the communities in which people prefer to be. Why should a white church be invaded by blacks and other races, if the congregation is perfectly happy with the church the way it is?</p>
<p>Why should the whites be forced to feel like strangers in their own churches? Why can&rsquo;t they just worship God in peace?</p>

Is Heaven integrated? Please reference chapter and verse.</p>
<p>Believers should understand that God created distinct people in segregated places throughout the world. He didn&rsquo;t create one people in all places. He created diverse people in different places.</p>
<p>God certainly didn&rsquo;t give us a model of integration. </p>
<p>If the Bible teaches us through metaphors, may this would apply to integration:</p>
<p><b>Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, [as] of woollen and linen together.</b> Deuteronomy 22:11.</p>

		<p>Just like the Catholic church and its stance on immigration, these Protestant denominations are after more donations.  Follow the money $$$$$.  The Episcopals I get, with their lesbian pastors, but Baptists?  The Bible tells of the End Times and the looney things that will start to happen in the Church.  I quit going to church about 20 years ago.  I read the Bible and pray at home.  Who needs these faux religions anyway?  </p>

		<p>I have heard this story for the last three years and have become very worried about this. I predict someday churches will be de-segregated just like schools were de-segerated. This is what will happen. Buses of troops with bayonets will show up to force people to go to church where Uncle Sam says to go to church. The Waco Texas welcome wagon will be the first in line to make people bow down to diversity. Two years ago a game warden killed a deaf man in NC on private property. The old man was in a tree stand the first day of hunting season,the warden told him to drop his weapon. He did not reply so the warden shot him on private property. When churches are desegerated I am sure this warden will be the first one to volunteer to serve Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>If &#8220;most&#8221; pastors get their way and attract more minorities, they will actually have a less diverse congregation. At least as far as White parishioners go. Someone needs to explain the term &#8220;White flight&#8221; to these clueless pastors.<br>

<p>This kind of integration will never happen, unless there is massive government force, and the moment any American government starts forcing people to partake of certain religious services will be followed one microsecond later by the ACLU mobilizing even bigger than we did for the Normandy Invasion.  And the ACLU would be correct in doing so.</p>
<p>As a generality, blacks who go to church go to church to have a good time, to sing songs, to dance around in the pews, and in some cases, to hear race-based rabble-rousing demagoguery.  Whites who go to church want to hear some sort of moral lecture, and in some cases, participate in highly traditional and highly structured liturgical rituals and ceremonies.  Save a few of the holy roller charismatic types.</p>

		<p> What do these white pastors think their majority black congregation would do as soon as they became a majority?-replace the white pastor with a black one. Be careful what you wish for-your dream may come true. As America becomes less white and  majority nonwhite as projected to occur in 2042, this may become a takeover strategy allowing blacks to acquire white church facilities without paying for them.</p>

<p>Blacks must constantly laugh at Whitey Christians when then are in between serious plotting over how to get their hands on the investment endowments and kicking the Whiteys out of the church.</p>
<p>Christian should be a religion for warriors, not whimps.  Maybe Jesus really did &#8220;value the enriching and vibrant diversity&#8221; of Africa more than the high civilization of Europe, otherwise, he wouldn&rsquo;t allow Europeans to crucify themselves while worshipping afrovoodoo fetishes.</p>

		<p>Well, Very Reverend Bob Hill, put your money where your mouth is. Sell you house(or have your Deacons sell the Parsonage) and move yourself and family to a house in the &#8216;hood. Thus some seed capital with which to kick start this initiative will be generated and you can be instantly be immersed (Missionary style) into the culture of your new flock. Just don&rsquo;t let anybody talk you into a postion other than Missionary!!</p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s have these sanctimonious white pastors step outside their liberal dream-world and move into the wonderfully diverse neighborhoods they so desire in the pews.  It&rsquo;ll never happen and if it did it might drive some sense into their skulls. It is like the rich liberals in the congress who constantly talk about diversity and the need to spend billions more on public schools, while they live in exclusive gated communities and sent their own children to monocromatic private schools.  It is all so nauseating!</p>

		<p>This article reminds me of the &#8220;White Heaven&#8221; concept from when before I was born.  How black people thought that whites or God or whatever was raisss too, and white people that went to white churches went to white Heaven.  And black people would go to black heaven unless they went to white churches.</p>
<p>It is absolutely laughable. </p>
<p>If they want more multicultural churches, try to recruit some Arabs (hopefully already Muslim) to their church and see how that goes.</p>
<p>We already have forced integration on a local, state, and federal level.  Now they are trying to do it on a spiritual level, since there is a separation of church and state.  It would not shock me of the liberals are sending extra funds to these churches, be it personal or government, to help with the integration.  The liberals know no bounds in trying to do this.</p>

		<p>16  &mdash;  Flaxwen-headed Strumpet  &mdash;  Is correct.  <br>
<p><br>
A white preacher claiming that his church needs more blacks is just him proclaiming his eminence, &ldquo;Everybody look at me. I am a great person because I am not a racist.&rdquo; <br>
<p><br>
Same for Catholic Bishops.  All these self-righteous blowhards should leave their mansions and comfy apartments, fine food and wine, good cars and safety and go preach the word of the Lord where the blacks and Mexicans are.<br>
<p><br>
It is immoral of them to destroy people lives by bringing in criminals and parasites.  A percentage of the money we Catholics give in the collection goes to the bishop to care for his diocese.  I would like to see that money given instead to Mexicans in Mexico, and see how the bishops like that idea of sharing the wealth.<br>
<p><br>
Better yet I would like to force every bishop that wants Mexicans up here to take a car load of them into his home and let the benefits of multiculturalism rub off on him for a while.  <br>
<p><br>
Either method hypocrisy cured.<br>

<p>Hmmm&hellip;didn&rsquo;t the very book this man claims to follow speak of God separating the various nations of men at the tower of Babel? Why are parishioners &#8220;ugly&#8221; if they believe in the older concept of God rather than the currently fashionable one?</p>
<p>I find a white minister who takes an unnatural interest in leading a black congregation to be a little creepy and suspect&hellip;call it the &#8220;Jim Jones Phenomenon.&#8221;</p>
<p>In any event, this article shows why religion and Christianity will never be white people&rsquo;s salvation. Science and secularism have permanently knocked Christianity out of it&rsquo;s dominant position. Christianity is simply a follower of currently fashionable trends, not a true molder of them. </p>
<p>The Old Testament God was stern and commanding, the New Testament God was weak and conciliatory, with Jesus saying &#8220;Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar&rsquo;s.&#8221; The Middle Ages God was once again all-powerful while the Enlightenment God became progressively weaker, all the way up to our current age, which is his permanent position, because science has allowed man to take a bite of the apple, so to speak, which has forever opened his eyes. </p>
<p>Now the new religion of multiculturalism has replaced Christianity as the dominant religion (although it too, is in conflict with science, so science may ultimately prove to be our best ally).</p>

		<p>I recall in the book of Acts, Philip taught the Ethiopian the gospel.  Did the Ethiopian want to stay in Judaea?  Nope, he went back to his homeland and spread the word there.</p>
<p>Yes, it does say in the Bible that in Christ there is neither man nor woman, Jew nor Greek.  Some people twist that around and use it to promote &#8220;diversity.&#8221;  But taken further, it can be used to justify gay &#8220;marriage&#8221; and the Bible speaks out against homosexuality.</p>
<p>It means that spiritually, in Christ, there&rsquo;s no difference.  But while you are still on this mortal coil, there are physical differences.  And &#8220;diversity&#8221; still isn&rsquo;t a good idea.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m a born again Christian and I left the church 7 years ago because I believed they were communist with Christian veneer. My family still worships the Lord Jesus Christ.  We do it at home, where there are no assaults on the family structure and no teen ministries to contend with. Worship of diversity is a false god, a trick of Satan.  A Christian&rsquo;s faith should be in God, not diversity.</p>

		<p><i>It&rsquo;s not a new thing, and not necessarily just a racial thing, either. In my hometown, Irish immigrants in the first half of the 19th Century built the first Catholic church in the community. German Catholic immigrants who started arriving somewhat later at first attended that church. But they found they weren&rsquo;t comfortable there, and so eventually they built their own Catholic church, a few blocks away. To this day, many old-time Catholics in this community refer to them as &ldquo;the Irish church&rdquo; and &ldquo;the German church.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>People prefer to be with their own kind. It took well over half a century before these two northwest European groups Americanized enough that large-scale mixing started between the two groups of Catholics. Now, though, my favorite German professor, who is from Frankfurt, was bemused at the large number of students in a class he surveyed who claimed &#8220;Irish and German&#8221; ancestry. (We&rsquo;re in a part of the country where there aren&rsquo;t many Italians or Poles)</p>

<p>Like in this story for example:</p>
<p>In 2001, it was 40 percent white, 40 percent African-American and 20 percent Hispanic. Gradually the African-American attendance increased. Today the church is 70 percent African-American.</p>

		<p>If God wanted everyone mixed together he wouldn&rsquo;t have created different races and tongues and dispersed them throughout the world.  Pastors pushing diversity are either knowlingly or unknowlingy pushing one worldism which is not part of Christian ideology.  The only way to bring about this one world government is to mix up the populations of the Earth.  </p>
<p>Also, the White pastors pushing diversity need to understand that diversity pushing White congregants out while increasing black ones.  Once a church reaches a black majority they will out the current pastor and replace them with one of their own.  </p>

		<p>Dario #5 Quite ridiculous, I totally agree.</p>
<p>I live in a predominately Anglo English speaking area. Within a 15 km radius of where I live we have the following: (This may not be complete list.)</p>
<p>Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, Serbian Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox,a Tongan Church, a Fijian Church, a Chinese Church, Filippino congregations and at least one Korean congregation.There is also a chuch that assists reformed homosexuals, another church that ministers to active homosexuals and a lesbian oriented church.</p>
<p>We also have the mainstream Anglican (Episcopal) Uniting (Methodist) and Presbyterian as well as Roman Catholic parishes. Surely this is adequate diversity to allow churchgoers to associated with other groups that they feel comfortable with?</p>
<p>But no! As I said I live in a white Anglo area so what do the church authorities do? They supply us with 3rd world ministers with a poor command of English, and you just can not relate to in times of personal or family crises.</p>
<p>Solution, vote with your feet. Social engineering has no place in the church.</p>
<p>PS We were recently made most welcome in a Pacific Islander church, but it was a once only event and really they simply prefer to be with their own.</p>

<p>Hip Hop Comes to the Cathedral of the Confederacy<br>
August 3, 2006</p>

<p>A thumping bass filled the nave of St. Paul&rsquo;s Episcopal Church in downtown Richmond, Virginia, on Wednesday night. A choir offered a simple and hypnotic chant from rapper Kanye West&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Jesus Walks&rdquo; as young African Americans danced down the center aisle behind a thurifer and other acolytes.</p>
<p>(hypnotic chant, rapper, danced- VOODOO!)</p>
<p><br>
Dancers in a first wave were frenetic and elastic, changing their moves every few minutes. A second wave ambled together two-by-two in a combination of hip hop moves called snapping and stepping. The procession wound up and down the aisles of St. Paul&rsquo;s three times, and when &ldquo;Jesus Walks&rdquo; concluded, the congregation roared its enthusiasm.</p>
<p>(frenetic, elastic, snapping and stepping, roared, enthusiasm- VOODOO!)</p>
<p><br>
The hip hop service was one of many liturgies during the five-day convention, but its symbolism was rich. St. Paul&rsquo;s was once known as the &#8220;Cathedral of the Confederacy,&#8221; and as the dancers brought the choreography of the street into the church, they passed by pews once occupied by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and General Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>(choreography of the street- VOODOO!)</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Union of Black Episcopalians members watched the latest version of Traces of the Trade, a documentary by Katrina Browne. Ms. Browne needs another $100,000 to complete the film, which shows her and other descendants of the slave-trading DeWolf family of Rhode Island confronting their family&rsquo;s history. Browne and nine other family members embarked on a three-week journey that retraced a slave-trade triangle connecting Rhode Island, West Africa and Cuba.</p>
<p>(we must atone for the sins of segregation by holding ourselves accountable to people of color for our unearned White privilges and begin the reconciliation and healing through giving all your stuff away to the blacks- VOODOO!)</p>

		<p>I attended an all-black church once in the late 70s/early 80s, and everyone was very welcoming.  They had three different choirs, even though it was only a medium-sized church, and it was all very interesting   &mdash;   different preaching style, etc.</p>
<p>But I am white, and I like a traditional liturgy, and classic &#8220;white&#8221; hymns from England or Germany.  A multi-culti church is going to have to make all kinds of compromises to give a little something to each group, which means that in an hour-long service, there will be substantially LESS of what is meaningful to me.  Why should whites have to compromise on Sunday, after compromising all week in every other area of their lives?</p>
<p>I attended a large suburban church in an all-white upscale area when I was living in nearby apartments and going through a horrible divorce and custody fight.  The church shoved all the &#8220;single moms&#8221; (who were all white) into a group led by a screwed up female volunteer, cutting off their access to older whites (male and female) who could have helped them network their way into better jobs, etc.  There were several single mothers in that group whose lives would have been transformed by a decent job with health benefits.  Meanwhile, the church was spending a fortune (professional full-time pastors, translators, big budget, expensive giveaways, etc.) on Minority Outreach to immigrants.  The &#8220;Single Mom&#8221; ghettoization was so uncomfortable that I left the church.</p>

		<p>I agree with Martin Hughes. I don&rsquo;t play church, at all. </p>
<p>With my being single with no kids, it&rsquo;s hard to fit. But, I enjoy sitting in the balcony. I love hearing the organ play and HOLDING a hymnal while singing. I like having an outline of the sermon, knowing my preacher has prepared because of being led to share with us. If you don&rsquo;t like what you hear from a preacher in a church, go where someone will tell you what you want to hear. These places just happen to be more &#8216;diverse&rsquo; in ethnicity. </p>
<p>I just commented in an email to a friend the other day about the EVIL that has all the elites and liberals of overpowering numbers in this country in a trance. That&rsquo;s the only logical answer I&rsquo;ve been able to come up with. </p>

<p><br>
&#8220;Is Heaven integrated? Please reference chapter and verse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing much is said in the Bible regarding the makeup of it, except a few hints like &#8220;many houses&#8221; and the eternal praising and glory (boring).  But if Christians were instructed to witness and convert to the entire world so that they may be saved, it must logically follow that &#8220;heaven&#8221; is integrated, multicultural, diversified, etc., however strictly want to interpret the Bible.  Certainly, there is no passage in the NT that calls whites &#8220;God&rsquo;s Chosen People,&#8221; and the NT was intended, (if we are to believe the words attributed to Jesus) to change and &#8220;complete the law.&#8221;  Most theologians take that to mean that everyone could be among &#8220;God&rsquo;s Chosen People&#8221; if they accepted Jesus and were saved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believers should understand that God created distinct people in segregated places throughout the world. He didn&rsquo;t create one people in all places. He created diverse people in different places.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Suddenly, God creates all races in all locations simultaneously, eh?  This half baked Creationist dribble automatically overturns itself to anyone with more than a two digit IQ.</p>
<p>&#8220;God certainly didn&rsquo;t give us a model of integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; Refer to my first reply.  Yes, &#8220;he&#8221; did.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Bible teaches us through metaphors, may this would apply to integration:</p>
<p>Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, [as] of woollen and linen together. Deuteronomy 22:11.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; As I reminded you above, the OT is subject to the NT, which the words attributed to Jesus say modify and complete the law.  If Christianity was to be a race or ethnic specialty, all those missionaries up through Europe, then to North America and beyond would have been violations of Christianity and therefore, never have occurred.  Only Jews, who rejected the NT or the claim of this Greek invented Jesus Christ and held to the words in the OT that you quote as if Christians are subject to it.  You are confusing Judaism with Christianity, probably intentionally to make your point.  </p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t have it both ways.  The OT is included in the Christian Bible to give background and veracity to the NT.  But any Christian theologian will tell you that you cannot subvert the instruction of the NT with OT verse, only enhance it.  As it is, you are stretching the use of that metaphor, because the remaining laws of conduct, including health, food, and sanitation, were taken literally and practiced that way.  Weavers perhaps required some laws so that they were not cheating buyers by substituting cotton for wool.  There was no department of commerce, or food and sanitation.  All social and political life came from the religion and Judaism is a very political religion.  All of the OT laws (including the TEN) that I can think of had practical, common sense reasons.  Only Jesus taught in metaphors.  OT prophets heard God directly, and laid down laws as the continued stories in the OT required.  But Moses preached freedom for all people, not just Jews.</p>
<p>Trying to justify our right to survival as white people through Christianity is useless, and it is being demonstrated everyday all the time.  Christianity teaches that we ought to forget about life on earth and only prepare for the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
<p>BTW, there is a group of Christians going about the country right now in a caravan. They are preaching that the faithful will be taken up on May 21, 2011 and the End of the World will come in October of this year.  These are white people, you know, the ones with uniformly higher IQs?  I can&rsquo;t wait to see how they will explain the failure away THIS time.</p>
<p>What you don&rsquo;t use or abuse, you loose.  So let&rsquo;s start using our gray matter a bit more before it is too late.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect example of a self-correcting problem.</p>
<p>First of all, white churches that want to become more diverse are probably pushing multiculturalism on their communities as well.</p>
<p>Secondly, white churches that DO become more diverse won&rsquo;t last for very long. When the number of members who are black or Mexican or whatever gets large enough, they&rsquo;ll vote out the white minister and take over, and the church will quickly become all black or Mexican.</p>
<p>When that happens, the church will quit calling for multiculturalism and we&rsquo;ll be rid of a nest of white liberal troublemakers.</p>
<p>Problem solved.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a born again Christian and I left the church 7 years ago because I believed they were communist with Christian veneer.&#8221; </p>
<p>&gt; You ought to study the history of the early Christians.  They were model communists in that they redistributed the wealth of the richer converts to the more plentiful poor.  Karl Marx used the historic example in his writings.  This was one major reason for the growth of the early church in the first and second centuries.  It represents the first larger social support system in history outside of the cloistered religious communes of the Jews, such as the Essenes.  Once it became the power in Rome, it became only a commune to its clergy, living off their congregations, like any warlord or king lived off the peasants (different names for the same people).  You cannot escape from the eventual communism that Christianity causes.  Even Jesus is illustrated splitting up bread and other food to hand out for free, and criticized his disciples for not sharing what they had.</p>
<p>&#8220;My family still worships the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; You realize that he was a Jew don&rsquo;t you?  That is why the Romans put that sign over his head, &#8220;King of the Jews.&#8221;  How does that jive with your exclusiveness?</p>
<p>&#8221; We do it at home, where there are no assaults on the family structure and no teen ministries to contend with. Worship of diversity is a false god, a trick of Satan. A Christian&rsquo;s faith should be in God, not diversity.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t disagree with the idea that Diversity is being preached like a religion.  But relying on prayers and faith to save the white race is not going to do it.  Even Cromwell said, &#8220;Put your faith in the Lord, and keep your powder dry.&#8221;  But Cromwell slaughtered tens of thousands of white people over which form of Christianity ought to prevail.  Where&rsquo;s your Satan there?  In the mirror, I&rsquo;d say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it does say in the Bible that in Christ there is neither man nor woman, Jew nor Greek. Some people twist that around and use it to promote &ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; But taken further, it can be used to justify gay &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; and the Bible speaks out against homosexuality.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; It seems one can twist Christianity around any way they want, according to history, these current postings, and your post.  You and everyone here is rationalizing to get the desired result, regardless of how obvious the contradiction.  If Jesus made it possible to forgive everything, then gays are forgiven too.  If every straight white person who is a hypocrite is counted (and everyone is), they will outnumber the amount of homosexuals who want to be Christians and still practice a homosexual life style.</p>
<p>It means that spiritually, in Christ, there&rsquo;s no difference. </p>
<p>&gt; If this is so, then heaven IS integrated, and all races and types are included under the wing of &#8220;God&rsquo;s Love.&#8221;  It is proclaimed so as in The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; &#8220;ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as locations go, Rome was undergoing the growing problems of being an increasingly multicultural city/state, and Christianity was part of that problem.  The Ethiopian who went back to Ethiopia was eventually followed by white Christians, who used that &#8220;in&#8221; to exploit the place and the people - as they historically did everywhere.  You can&rsquo;t take Christianity everywhere in the world, convert by intrigue and force, and then remain consistent in proclaiming that it only goes one way.  That is the major hook that is used to hang us whites every time.  Feeble counter proclamations don&rsquo;t wash with anyone, which is why it is so difficult to gain progress for whites in a Christian dominated culture. </p>
<p>You conservative Christians posting here, trying to justify your Christian selfishness are harming all whites insisting on your brainwashed in belief system must wake up and realize that Christianity is just a set of myths that got institutionalized and forced into the European psyche over centuries.  Real liberation would be to finally reject it and all its works and focus on real racial re-enforcing philosophies.  Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, being racially selfish is GOOD, but Christianity condemns it, and you will be in a steadily diminishing group, repelling whites with more intelligence, which are the ones we need to become Racial Realists.</p>
<p>I am with everyone here on preserving the white race, but the justification for exclusiveness of whites only Christianity is so easy to debunk that it&rsquo;s like &#8220;shooting fish n a barrel.&#8221;  We only make ourselves look really dumb because the hypocrisy of these comments and the lack of reason and logic is blatant and painfully obvious. </p>

		<p>I thought y&rsquo;all might be interested in this.</p>
<p>The scriptural basis that most pastors, and many enlightened Christians use in defense of the new multicultural schism is Acts 17:26.</p>
<p>In the KJV it reads:</p>
<p> And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p>
<p>In the NIV it reads:</p>
<p>26 From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. </p>
<p>They love the KJV since it can be implied that we are all of &#8216;one blood&rsquo;. Critics of Southern culture and its implied &#8216;racism&rsquo; also use it as David R. Goldfield did in his critique of neo-confederates: &#8216;Still Fighting the Civil War&rsquo;. However, they ignore the part about appointed times and distinct national identities because it could be used as a defense of: segregation, severe restrictions on immigration, and an indictment of egalitarianism, multiculturalism, and diversity.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this stewing in my mind for a while now, but never had a forum to present it in, until now.                    </p>

<p>There are sound Biblical reasons for separating humanity into races and nations and that is to keep us from forming a one world society that would eventually be corrupted resulting in an anti-God system that would persecute and destroy believers.

<p>This is to confuse &#8220;forgiveness&#8221; with &#8220;anything goes&#8221;. That is absurd. If &#8220;anything goes&#8221;, there is nothing to forgive. The point of forgiveness is to enable one to turn from sin and &#8220;anything goes&#8221; to God&rsquo;s right way. Homosexual acts or any other sinful acts can be forgiven - because Christ died in place of the sinner - IF the sinner accepts Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice in his behalf AND repents (i.e. turns from) and stops the sin.</p>
<p>And yes sinful human beings do twist the Bible to mean whatever they like, BUT their lies are exposed when you actually read the Bible and see its message in context. Furthermore God is fully aware that human&rsquo;s will do this (try to twist his word), which is why he gives the Holy Spirit to all who honestly, open-mindedly read the Bible. And ultimately in the final judgement lies and liars will be judged and utterly condemned.  </p>

<p>CWNY is something else. It has soul, and its author has a fine sense of the English language. It may or may not be insane, but it&rsquo;s not insipid.</p>

		<p>Whiteplight you are an expert at destroying straw men. Marx was all about destroying Christianity because he knew it must be defeated for &#8220;communism&#8221; to win. The &#8220;commies&#8221; went after the father, because children learn to relate to a heavenly father by obeying an earthly father. Destroy the father as head of the family and you destroy the child&rsquo;s ability to be obedient to a heavenly father. Destroy a child&rsquo;s fear of God and you can make them slaves of their sin and steal their culture. That is what has been done in the West. See Freud, Marcuse, etc.</p>

<p> Are All Hoodies Worn By Criminals?</p>
<p>by Bob Butler <br>
Think about a crime in which the suspect is described as a young man wearing baggy pants and a hooded sweatshirt (hoodie). Does that bring to mind any particular race? It should.<br>
The Maynard Institute for Journalism Education last year launched an initiative to change the way the media reported on boys and men of color.<br>
 <br>
Coverage of boys and men of color tends to center around crime, sports and entertainment. Not only does this present a distorted image of this particular population, it also serves to instill fear in the wider society.<br>

The description of young males wearing &#8220;hoodies&#8221; mostly conjures up images of Black suspects.</p>

		<p>Betrayed:  I&rsquo;m in my mid 50s, and I would say that diversity and multiculturalism peaked in the 90s, and it has been downhill for those concepts since then.  The US governmnet has promised way too much to too many, for too long, and a huge financial crisis is about to hit.  There will be massive rioting and civil unrest as real levels of benefits are cut, and when it is all over, things will be very different.  Amnesty of illegals will be completely off the table (actually, I think this point may have already been achieved), legal immigration will be tightly restricted for at least a generation, and a lot of the Affirmative Action laws will be dumped in response to white agitation for freedom of association in all aspects of life. </p>
<p>The next five years look very scary to me, but I think things will get better eventually.</p>
