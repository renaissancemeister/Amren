			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Richard Posner, Becker-Posner Blog, January 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>International comparisons are tricky, as Becker points out, but the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), which tests 15-year-olds for proficiency in reading, math, and science by well designed standard tests conducted in thousands of schools all over the world, is a careful and responsible program, the results of which deserve to be taken seriously. The latest results (which are for 2009) reveal among other things that although the United States spends more money per student on secondary school education than any other country except Switzerland and Austria, Americans&rsquo; performance on the PISA tests is mediocre. In the latest tests Americans ranked 17 in reading, 24 in science, and 30 in math. 15-year-old kids in East Asian nations (including Australia and New Zealand), along with Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada, outperform the United States in all three subjects. Since 2000, when the PISA tests were first given, the United States has fallen in rank in reading and science, and is unchanged in math.</p>
<p>{snip} Schooling is only one, though doubtless an important, input into performance on the PISA tests. Another is IQ. There have been some efforts to compare IQ across countries, notably by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen; see their 2006 book <cite>IQ and Global Inequality.</cite> Their results cannot be regarded as definitive, given significant limitations in the data, but they are suggestive. The authors find that the East Asian countries, which generally rank highest on the PISA tests (including reading  &mdash;  not just math and sciene), have the highest average IQs; the average IQ of Americans is lower because of our large black and Hispanic populations, which have lower average IQs than whites and Asians.</p>
<p>IQ is understood to reflect both genetic endowment and environmental factors, particularly factors operative very early in a child&rsquo;s life, including prenatal care, maternal health, the educational level of the parents, family stability, and poverty (all these are correlated, and could of course reflect low IQs of parents as well as causing low IQs in their children). The case for very early intervention in children&rsquo;s development, powerfully urged by the distinguished University of Chicago economist James Heckman, can be understood as an effort to lift IQs in the black and Hispanic communities and by doing so improve the educational performance of black and Hispanic children, including performance on the PISA tests. It is true that Heckman emphasizes noncognitive skills that facilitate learning, but these skills could also increase performance on IQ tests, indicating a positive effect on IQ.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If IQ is playing a significant role in America&rsquo;s mediocre showing on the PISA tests, improvements in secondary school education are unlikely to have dramatic effects. The white and Asian kids in American schools are already doing fine, for the most part; the black and Hispanic kids may not do much better until their early childhood environment is improved to the point at which black and Hispanic IQs are raised significantly.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This observation is especially pertinent to another finding in the PISA report, which is that poor kids do better in a school that has mostly middle-class kids. Our education system, both public and private, tends as a practical matter to be segregated according to family income and social class. {snip}</p>
<p>Becker points out that despite the imperfections of its educational system, America remains preeminent in innovation. This is important but it appears to be due in part to the nation&rsquo;s attractiveness to immigrants. Many of our innovators are foreign born; increasingly they are Asian. The United States, as a result of generous immigration policies in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, also has the largest Jewish population in the world  &mdash;  larger than Israel&rsquo;s, and a higher percentage of American Jews are Ashkenazi  &mdash;  that is, descendants of European Jewish immigrants. This is significant because Ashkenazi Jews have a significantly higher average IQ than other Americans, including (though the margin is small) East Asians, and, as important, a very strong cultural orientation toward high achievement in business, science, and intellectual fields generally. From the standpoint of innovation, a wide distribution of IQs is more important than the average IQ, because most innovations will come from persons with an above-average IQ, and in scientific and other technical fields from persons with a way-above-average IQ. Moreover, because of the bell shape (normal distribution) of IQ across persons, a higher average IQ translates into a much longer upper tail  &mdash;  the part of the distribution that contains the highest IQs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately as IQ is likely only 20% environment at best(I highly doubt that myself), there can be no chance of a &#8220;significant&#8221; IQ raise short of genetic manipulation, which is impossible at the present.  The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study proved this beyond the shadow of a doubt.  Black, mulatto and white children all raised by rich, white parents.</p>
<p>The IQ deviation was still the same, Whites - Mulattos - Blacks.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Transracial_Adoption_Study</a></p>
<p>The black children had an average IQ of 89 which means their IQ only rose from the average of 85(please note - this is the average of AMERICAN blacks, who are roughly 15-20% european on average) by four points when their environment was controlled.</p>
<p>The adopted white children were at 106, which is a three point rise from the average white IQ of 103.  The non-adopted white children had an average IQ of 115.</p>
<p>Putting it bluntly, you could raise these children in mansions surrounded by private tutors and it wouldn&rsquo;t make a difference. To quote my favorite comedian Ron White, &#8220;You can&rsquo;t fix stupid.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Of course poor children do better in a mostly middle-class school  &mdash;  because most of such kids are white children who are not otherwise struggling to learn in ill-run, disciplineless black-majority schools!  But of course the left will use such statistics to attempt to bolster their threadbare arguments for busing for racial integration.<br>
At least the article dares to propose IQ as a problem for black students.</p>

		<p>This is why I advocate home schooling for white kids.  If they go to public schools, they will be bullied mercilessly by blacks and browns.  It can happen to Asians as well, but they can sometimes blend in better and don&rsquo;t seem to be targeted so much.  White parents, teach your kids at home - there is ample proof that the practice will raise your kids&rsquo; performance on the state tests, and that your kids will get a few years ahead of their grade level in a short amount of time.   Public schools these days are NOT the place for white kids, pure and simple.  30 or 40 years ago it was fine, but times have changed.  The gods of multiculturalism have produced their mediocre-and-lower results, and in my view the only choice whites have is to keep their kids far away from it.</p>

		<p>NO psychologist, educator, or politician still believes that low black IQ is caused by environmental factors.</p>
<p>the evidence has been accumulating for a century, the arguments for a purely environmental causation are simply too flimsy.</p>
<p>they are ALL deliberately and consciously lying as they wait for SOMEONE ELSE to break the taboo are talking openly about race and IQ.</p>
<p>recently, we have heard the argument that all racial groups MUST!!!! have the same AMOUNT of intelligence, it just takes different FORMS, so blacks must have some OTHER kind of intelligence that has yet to be identified - something so subtle and difficult to isolate that no one has managed to get a glimpse of it yet.</p>
<p>in other words, the equalitarians are getting desperate.</p>
<p>we need a group of eminent scientists to publicly take a sledgehammer to the BIG LIE of the past century and raise the media cannot ignore.</p>
<p>until then, policymakers should adopt the following line:</p>
<p>the biggest obstacle facing blacks continues to be catastrophically low cognitive ability, and so far all attempts to improve it have been unqualified failures.</p>
<p>this leaves causation in question without pandering to the &#8220;yes we can&#8221; garbage about equality.</p>
<p>part of the process of dismantling the biggest lie in history is to study long list of failed attempts and to remind people of them (liberals are fond of saying that &#8220;nothing has been tried&#8221;, strangely forcing themselves to have amnesia for all of their own victories in getting funding for great society programs).</p>
<p>we don&rsquo;t have a complete history (as far as I know) of the amazing spectrum of attempts to raise black IQ.</p>

		<p>That the most cited federal judge raises the intelligence issue is significant and hopeful.</p>
<p>Posner is a recognized genius: a pioneer in the law &amp; economics movement, lawyers who argue before him know that he will know the case better than they.</p>
<p>He is also a prolific author. Hopefully he will write a book tackling the demographic problems we face. I believe he&rsquo;d stick to his guns unlike another genius James Watson.</p>
