<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The U.S. military is too white and too male at the top and needs to change recruiting and promotion policies and lift its ban on women in combat, an independent report for Congress said Monday.</p>
<p>Seventy-seven percent of senior officers in the active-duty military are white, while only 8 percent are black, 5 percent are Hispanic and 16 percent are women, the report by an independent panel said, quoting data from September 2008.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The report ordered by Congress in 2009 calls for greater diversity in the military&rsquo;s leadership so it will better reflect the racial, ethnic and gender mix in the armed forces and in American society.</p>
<p>Efforts over the years to develop a more equal opportunity military have increased the number of women and racial and ethnic minorities in the ranks of leadership. But, the report said, &#8220;despite undeniable successes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the armed forces have not yet succeeded in developing a continuing stream of leaders who are as diverse as the nation they serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Having military brass that better mirrors the nation can inspire future recruits and help create trust among the general population, the commission said.</p>
<p>Among recommendations is that the military eliminate policies that exclude women from combat units, phasing in additional career fields and units that they can be assigned to as long as they are qualified. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Stretching the definition of diversity, the report also said the military must harness people with a greater range of skills and backgrounds in, for instance, cyber systems, languages and cultural knowledge to be able to operate in an era of new threats and to collaborate with international partners and others.</p>

		<p>&#8220;the armed forces have not yet succeeded in developing a continuing stream of leaders who are as diverse as the nation they serve.&#8221; - And they never will.  It is impossible to match the top level leaders of any organization (military or otherwise) with the current, ever-changing, demographics of the country. It takes 25-30 years to develop the high-caliber leadership corp that we have, and rushing that development for the sake of keeping up with the diversity of the nation will surely have a negative effect.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s that noise I hear? Ah&hellip;the rolling over of the Republicans &amp; &#8220;conservatives&#8221; on this issue, just like they rolled over for the repeal of Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell. Expect a few isolated voices against women in infantry &amp; armor, otherwise only token resistance. The fix is in.</p>

		<p>Join the NRA and fight to maintain your 2nd amendment rights.  We will end up having to defend ourselves when the chips are down.  The military will end up a failed experiment in political correctness.  Its a bad joke to think minorities, gays, and women will competently defend western civilization.  It will probably be necessary to go back to the old state militia system and bypass the military entirely.  </p>

		<p>Much of the corruption, sexual harassment, rape, prostitution, and other problems the military enjoys today is due to our coed military.  I have always known that I would never fit into today&rsquo;s American military model because it is ridiculous for men who must pass more rigorous requirements and fight in combat, to be taking orders from women, who are merely extending their softball league mentality into a military career, let alone required to salute them.  The separate services of the WW2 era were more efficient and kept more people safe from abuse and the temptations that having the opposite sex available so readily creates.  </p>
<p>For those who argue that women belong in combat, I say, &#8220;HA!&#8221;  The real combat in Afghanistan is being done in very harsh conditions.  Let&rsquo;s set a 160lb pack, a weapon, and all the other accouterments of the field fighter, and then send a squad of female fighters off for a week, like the men are.  I will bet my life that most of them will never come back, and the ones that do will be traumatized beyond usefulness for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>I would love to get this equal rights issue settled once and for all.  Only males must STILL register for the draft, let&rsquo;s make ALL citizens register at 18.  Let&rsquo;s reinstate the draft and get a REAL representation of America into our armed forces.  Let&rsquo;s see how many females will protest.  My guess is that a great deal would change.  All we are doing now is allowing a few lesbians into the officer ranks.  Let&rsquo;s see how well females really can multitask.  When women are forced to endure what all males must in obligation and actual combat, then they may have earned all the rights and privileges they have now and continue to work to expand.  They want it, GIVE THEM HELL.</p>

		<p>I spent 25 years in the Marine Corps. During Vietnam the blacks were crying about how unfairly they were treated by being in the combat arms. (Infantry, Armor, Artillery, and door gunners)</p>
<p>In reality they had a lower % than their share of the population.</p>
<p>In 1968 they lowered the required IQ score for black officers, and don&rsquo;t tell me it didn&rsquo;t happen, I was there.</p>
<p>Now the morons in public office want women in combat So we can be more diverse! It&rsquo;s easier for a minority to get a commission than it is for a white, and they still can&rsquo;t cut the grade. Right now almost all of the combat arms are white. Almost no blacks or hispanics are in the special forces. (Rangers, Airborne, Marine Recon, Navy Seals.) They simply can&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The U.S. military is too white and too male at the top and needs to change recruiting and promotion policies and lift its ban on women in combat, an independent report for Congress said Monday.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to be able to check the bacgrounds of this &#8220;independent&#8221; panel.  I&rsquo;ve no doubt whatsoever it contains blacks, feminists and an assortment of oddballs that all have some kind of axe to grind with mainstream America and want to see the military screwed up as badly as society at large.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re cruising for a bruising, if they have their way.  No military should be manipulated in some kind of sick, perverted social experiment, and if the US military continues on with its existing deteriorating policies, then it will suffer a humiliating defeat at some point in the near future. I can promise that.</p>
<p>However, will that situation have time to reach fruition? Since the entire empire is fast degenerating financially and socially and will experience a greater economic hit very soon, a military catastrophe is probably a moot point right now.</p>
<p>Too, the military won&rsquo;t have enough money to keep it anywhere near its present level of readiness beginning right now, and the policies it has invoked up to this point have weakened it considerably.  The same is true with European militaries.  I just read in the news where a bunch of rag tag civilians captured &#8220;elite&#8221; British personnel in Libya in a humiliating debacle.   </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s hoping patriots and white nationalists encourage their young males to avoid the US military at all costs.</p>

<p>And at the same time they just MUST have more blacks and black officers?  Two completely mutually exclusive goals there fella.  Blacks can barely speak their own language, unless they are NOI muslims who have learned arabic, and you sure don&rsquo;t want THEM in the military.  Blacks are far behind whites in cyber intelligence, foreign languages, and cultural sensitivity, and incapable of learning the advanced systems coming on to the battlefield.  Good luck with your goals there.   Ain&rsquo;t happening.<br>
Without a draft, blacks flee from combat roles as fast as they flee from country music.<br>

		<p>I spent four years in the Army from 2004-2008 and I have to say that racial tension was a constant part of daily life. The army was where I learned (contrary to school indoctrination) that racial hostility is not exclusive to only blacks and whites. I&rsquo;ve seen Hispanics, Asians, and blacks clash over perceived slights just as quickly, among each other, with minimal interference from whites.</p>
<p>Firstly, I have no problem with females in superior positions in Non-combat arms MOSs (military occupation specialties); if one works in Supply or as a Mechanic or Quartermaster, the world is not going to end in my opinion if a female is at the helm. However, if they let females either lead or particpant in infantry or artillery positions, they are asking for the big hurt. Even in rear echelon MOSs there are constant cases of sexual harrassment and fraternization. When I was in Baghdad, a group of female officers were arrested for running a prostitution ring (one of them had left a USB data stick with a list of customer in an internet cafe).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen competent and incompetent officers of both races; however I will say that mandated quotas that are color- and not performance-based will literally lead to death in many cases. Anyone who knows the history of Vietnam knows about fragging incidents. Affirmative action breeds resentment and contempt in an office workplace. In a combat field environment, it will bring nothing short of death. And that is no hyperbole on my part.</p>
<p>Lastly, I must say that if we continue to meddle in the middle-east, we should remember that sex roles are clearly defined (and that is a diplomatic way to put it). If muslim soldiers (Iraqi Jundhi) see a male suboordinate and saluting a female, I can tell you firsthand that their respect for the male soldier in question seriously declines. Men who are allowed to kill their wives for infidelity do not take kindly to female officers.</p>

		<p>The intent of post-1965 legal immigration policy is to make Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America&hellip;this includes the US military also. And once the US military is majority  high fertility post-1965 nonwhite, nonwhites will have the power to force permanent racial minority status-and all the racial discrimination and violence that will come with racial minority status-on Native Born White Americans.</p>
<p>All of this is driven by a foreign policy that has nothing to with the protection and defense of Native Born White Americans within the borders of America. Republican and Democratic foreign policy is driven by the needs of the Miltary Industrial Complex. The mantra of diversity is just the &#8220;humane&#8221; cover for what is very obviously a very nasty racket for the coporations-GE and Haliburton to be specific. The intentions are not humane. The end-game of Republican-Democratic war party &#8220;humane&#8221; interventions is the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. Let me tell you, Native Born White Americans are in a very precarious situation..this should be obvious.</p>
<p>Think of the vicious logic to it all:if it is racist to have a majority White Officer Corp, then it is racist to have a majority White military&hellip;a very short hop to:it is racist to have a majority Native Born White American majority in America as a whole..you can reverse the implication arrows an argue in he reverse direction.</p>
<p>General Smedley Butler in 1936 stated in his autibiography that &#8220;war is a racket&#8221;. War in 20011 is also about race-replacing the Native Born White Majority with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites&hellip;at a very rapid pace.</p>
<p>A majority nonwhite &#8220;US&#8221; Miltary means that  the fate of Native Born White Americans will be completely in the hands of high fertility nonwhites. Why should we be in favor of this state of affairs?</p>

		<p> Of course, the actual effectiveness of the military is not a concern. In addition, a presumed &#8220;discrimination&#8221; on the part of whites must be countered with deliberate discrimination against whites. This is life in the Orwellian world of modern-day America.</p>
<p><i> Stretching the definition of diversity, the report also said the military must harness people with a greater range of skills and backgrounds in, for instance, cyber systems, languages and cultural knowledge to be able to operate in an era of new threats and to collaborate with international partners and others.</i> </p>
<p>On the contrary, rather than &#8220;stretching the definition of diversity,&#8221; this kind of <i>functional</i> diversity of skills is the only kind that really matters. The rest is just a racial and sexual head count.</p>

		<p>They&rsquo;ve been trying to dumb down the military for years.  Now they are going to bring in more minorities so that when things implode, minorities - and even more so recent immigrants - will have no hesitation firing on whitey (the race dominant in the liberty movement and the only race that will put in wrench in their plans).  Better start looking for dual citizenship cause you and your kids are going to need it within the next 10 years.  It&rsquo;s called global governance - and with it will come population reduction - and IT IS THE AGENDA!  Get off the cell phone, turn off the basketball/football game, get off the couch and open your eyes!!!<br>

		<p>This is nothing new.   Back in the early 1990s I went through a rigorous military training program in a branch of the service that was exclusively white and Asian. Our incoming class dutifully included 13% blacks. These candidates had been put through a &lsquo;math and physics for dummies&rsquo; in the months leading up to the program kick-off.</p>
<p>All 13 failed out in the beginning stages of the program. The last one to go got violent and received non-judicial punishment. Our holier-than-thou overlords did these relatively promising black candidates no favors.</p>
<p>It is probably easier to achieve these national goals today, with the flexibility to simply lower standards.</p>

		<p>This recalls the immortal words of U. S. Army Chief of Staff General W. George Casey, Jr. uttered in the aftermath of diverse Major Nidal Malik Hasan&rsquo;s killing 13 U. S. soldiers and wounding 32 more at Fort hood, Texas on Nov. 5, 2009: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Our diversity, not only in our Army, but in our country, is a strength.  And as horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that&rsquo;s worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(&ldquo;General Casey: Diversity Shouldn&rsquo;t be Casualty of Fort Hood,&rdquo; Reuters, Nov. 8, 2009) <br>
<a href="https://tinyurl.com/" rel="nofollow">https://tinyurl.com/</a></p>
<p>Alas, for General Casey and the no-doubt like-minded top brass in the other service brances, in order for the great strength of diversity to fully blossom in the U. S. military, the leadership will have to follow the lead of America&rsquo;s elite universities and dramatically lower standards.  That is because the realities of the diverse human capital the military seeks to elevate to the upper ranks present an otherwise insurmountable obstacle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time [minority students] reach grade 12, if they do so at all, minority students are about four years behind other young people. Indeed, 17 year-old African American and Latino students have skills in English, mathematics and science similar to those of 13-year-old white students.&rdquo; (Education Trust, &ldquo;Closing the Achievement Gap,&rdquo; National Governors Association Clearinghouse, 2002, 9th paragraph) <br>
https://tinyurl.com/2d6sayq</p>
<p>Note the conditional &ldquo;if they do so [reach 12th grade] at all.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Those words means that the minority-white achievement gap is &ldquo;four years&rdquo; for the above-average contingent of minority students still in school by 12th grade. The below-average contingent (half of the age cohort) have already dropped out. <br>

		<p>Given that the military is trusted more than Congress or the press one could well wonder just how more trust who wants from whom. I have personnally witnessed spine twisting/arm twisting rationalization to help &#8220;deserving members&#8221; of protected groups be promoted. This is nothing less than an attempt to further change the mindset of the military from the non politized ebtity that it is. This does not bode well.</p>

The U.S. military is too white and too male at the top and needs to change recruiting and promotion policies and lift its ban on women in combat, an independent report for Congress said Monday.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>When women can jump 10ft ditches with 70lb packs, 40lbs of vest and weapon and 20lbs of ammunition, batteries and other unit-support gear and not before.  Because the only way to really avoid IEDs is to maneuver around civilian occupation zones but if you are running like it was morning PT, you won&rsquo;t have much fight on you _when you find them_.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Seventy-seven percent of senior officers in the active-duty military are white, while only 8 percent are black, 5 percent are Hispanic and 16 percent are women, the report by an independent panel said, quoting data from September 2008.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p><br>
When a man tells a Marine to jump, the Marine takes it as a challenge to do better than the officer can.  When a woman tells a Marine to jump, it&rsquo;s a studied insult as an exercise in domination.  Because he knows she never will jump as high as he can (52% of upper body, 66% of lower body, 25% lower cardio/respiratory capacity).</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The report ordered by Congress in 2009 calls for greater diversity in the military&rsquo;s leadership so it will better reflect the racial, ethnic and gender mix in the armed forces and in American society.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>And the Homogenous Chinese will kick our sorry behinds because they are less than a generation away from a late iron age agrarian culture and their farming -women- are stronger, more endurant and have higher willpower than our civilian men.</p>
<p>Added to which, Hispanics will fight.  Blacks won&rsquo;t.  Women will until they realize how pathetic they are at it and break down because they can&rsquo;t keep up with men and know this makes them a bigger target.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Efforts over the years to develop a more equal opportunity military have increased the number of women and racial and ethnic minorities in the ranks of leadership.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Isolating those spots from white careerists using illegal and unConstitutional quotas rather than merit based qualifications.  Driving whites from the combat arms in droves because it&rsquo;s &#8216;up or out&rsquo; anyway and they have no where to go and nothing to look forward to, except institutional biases towards the weak in officer positions where there should never be anything but solid symbols of co-ethnic = co-identity strength.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Among recommendations is that the military eliminate policies that exclude women from combat units, phasing in additional career fields and units that they can be assigned to as long as they are qualified. {snip}<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Marines call women dick holsters because if you train a man to kill well as a function of pumping up his self confidence as his muscle tone and testosterone, there is _always_ going to be heightened perception of their strength vs. others weaknesses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not out of control because they compete against each other and are so harshly disciplined with constant training that they know (and prefer) the differences between battlefield exigency and civilian life.  That doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be dragging in artifacts that belong, in a trained warriors mind, more firmly on the &#8216;protect, respect and breed with&rsquo; side of the line.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just the way it is.  Killers can&rsquo;t be kind.  You never want to meet a soldier &#8216;on the job&rsquo;.  And women cannot command the respect of nor compete with, men in a combat role.</p>
<p>If you make them officers as essentially a long jump past the combat MOS to &#8216;combat area&rsquo;, leadership, role, you remove all hope of the Marine who made it through of achieving his own career escape from the combat arms, once his knees and ankles and back remove the fun and lower his own performance levels.</p>
<p>Fewer men in leadership roles, replaced by women and minorities who -never were- in combat positions, means the utter breakdown in morale and rank loyalties is sure to follow.</p>
<p>Not everyone joins for college.  Not everyone is there to get off the farm or out of the inner city.  And (surprisingly) a lot of those with that commitment are _still white_.  Don&rsquo;t screw up the one thing that still works, mostly, in this nation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Stretching the definition of diversity, the report also said the military must harness people with a greater range of skills and backgrounds in, for instance, cyber systems, languages and cultural knowledge to be able to operate in an era of new threats and to collaborate with international partners and others.<br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Talking ebonics and looking like the people you&rsquo;ve been brought in to &#8216;save&rsquo; may have a place, in the Peace Corps.  It doesn&rsquo;t in _The Marine Corps_.  Or any other, professional, fighting service branch.  If X ethny, gender or what have you can&rsquo;t do the job, don&rsquo;t lower the qualification requirements until the job no longer gets done.</p>
<p>That is a recipe for disaster in a world where, increasingly, the enemy is just as advanced, technically, as we are.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve said it before, any white man who joins the ground combat forces ought to have his head examined.  He&rsquo;s fighting for a system that hates his guts and wants to see him and all his kind exterminated.  Even while they&rsquo;re off doing most of the dying in Afghanistan and Iraq this is the sort of thanks they get from the genocidal establishment.   </p>
<p>The silver lining is that the more the military becomes non-white the more incompetent it will be, and fewer whites will want to serve.  The government will be far less likely to start useless wars like Iraq with an Affirmative Action Army.  Despite all their propaganda they understand the reality of multiculturalism. </p>

		<p>This despicable call to allow women in combat is a call for genocide, in my opinion. I might be wrong, but think about it-<br>
I would think that most of the women who are wailing about wanting to be in combat are white. I am making an educated assumption, from what I know of the types of &#8220;jobs&#8221; minority female civilians tend towards. Military or not, I know minority females do not like to get down and dirty. Combat, I would think, is a hard, difficult, dirty job. I would also think that if one volunteers for combat are probably patriots. Again, I don&rsquo;t think many minority women qualify as such.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;m not being exactly eloquent, here, but I think I am getting my point across&hellip;</p>
<p>When they want to kill your women, they want to kill your entire race, bloodline, people. <br>

There is no mention of poor job performance or any other grounds for getting whites out of officer positions except for race. If there was a report stating too many blacks or latinos were officers, the MSM would be all over the story screaming racism. In the US it is acceptable to be racist against whites, this report is total proof of that fact.</p>

We are in trouble as a nation when we are using quotas for our military leadership under the guise of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.

		<p>Woman in combat means more dead whites, pure and simple.  As well as fewer future whites.  The white men who have died in combat over the last 45 years have died to make room for Mexicans, Indians and Muslims in America.  Thin our ranks even more.  The Army in particular uses white men as bullet bags as my Navy brother-in-law says. And when the revolution comes the blacks and browns will have no qualms about shooting the real Americans, kind of like in Libya where Quadaffi uses blacks to kill his own countrymen.</p>
<p>As for woman in the military, they have a place in their own, separate corps in support roles.  not in combat and not with men.</p>
<p>I am surprised at the small number of Hispanic officers, though.  Puerto Ricans have been serving in the military for the last 75 years at least and are far more competent than blacks.<br>

		<p>Promotion in the military should be strictly on merit.  One of the reason America is the world super power is because promotion is usually based on merit.  In many parts of the world there is rampant corruption in all aspects of life, and all government jobs and promotions are based on corruption.  So they get a lot of stupid, incompetent people in high positions, and the country ends up being a dysfunctional hell hole.  I sure hope that is not America&rsquo;s future.  </p>

		<p>I am against Affirmative Action completely.  I feel that the best man should get the job, not someone to fill some quota.</p>
<p>I am against Affirmative Action ever more when it comes to national or global security.  This is just insane.  I am not even stretching the use of the term.  It is insane to think that someone should be commanding a war because of the color of their skin, making decisions that could cost thousands of lives, over someone that could do a better job.</p>
<p>Go back to World War II.  DO you think that Laquisha Jackson would have done a better job than Macarthur or Patton or Eisenhower because she was a woman and black?</p>
<p>If you can find a female or minority that would better protect our country, fine.  But this will be a catastrophe.  All of our enemies must be laughing at us right now.</p>
<p>And as for women in combat roles.  I am all for equality, but women can do certain things better than men and vice versa.  I think men make better soldiers.  The Jessica Lynch situation a few years back proved this when she just hid in the bushes crying while her fellow male soldiers fought and died for their freedom and safety.</p>
<p>If women made better soldiers than why didn&rsquo;t Rome, Sparta, Byzantine, French, English, Ottoman, Holy Roman Empire, Nazi Germany, USA, etc., etc., etc. NEVER have female soldiers in front line combat or even at all?</p>
<p>Play the Joan of Ark card if you will, that is one in several billion and it is debatable that she ever saw front line combat.  Conclusion:  You have a better chance of winning the lottery than finding a woman to successfully command an army in battle.  Statistics do not lie.</p>

I was in the Army, and in Saudi Arabia, under Clinton. To say it was a racist anti-white dung heap would be a gross under statement. There was a policy that if a (black) Sargent couldn&rsquo;t do his job, they would continually promote him until he was high enough not to do any damage. That policy didn&rsquo;t make any sense to me than, or now. It also never worked because they higher up would figure a way to screw something up, or they would promote another incompetent (minority) person to take his place. </p>
<p>My opinion is that the Military is no place for Women - PERIOD! (no pun intended) As for black and brown minorities, I think they belong in the Military in a separate unit. I am not going to die so that some minority has the freedom to get a welfare check. If they want freedom, let them serve.</p>

It is difficult for me to imagine the the military (especially the Army) being more densly stacked with blacks and women than now! The officer ranks are filled with shuckin and jivin blacks who are totally worthless in their command positions, ranking NCOs are just in it for the paycheck (as are most blacks) When the armored troops leave on patrol they are mostly all white males which, as I have said before (and personally witness every FN day) leaves the blacks on camp to harass and pursue White girls, though the black girls are also targets but especially White girls. We have black female O5s and O6s here on camp and they know nothing!! No White female Army officers though, the Marines have a few, but the Marines also have few blacks in uniform and those that are there are decidedly different in speech, attitude and personal conduct, as are most of the Marines I work with. The Special Forces Group here now has no blacks that I have witnessed yet, though there may yet be some. Blacks refuse to remove their &#8220;DO RAGS&#8221; in the mess hall, a decided breach of military decorum, wear their uniforms as if they are NBA stars with no admonishment from officers (who know their careers will end if they do admonish blacks) I have a LOT more, not heresay, but personal involvment and personally witnessed in more than 7 years here in the muddled east muslim wars!

<p>The simple fact is that blacks want no part of combat arms hardship and, especially, danger.  There are, to be sure, exceptions, but during my two tours in Vietnam (one in a rifle company and another with the 5th Special Forces, they were very much exceptions.</p>

		<p>I was in the Marines back in the early 80s.  We had blacks in our paltoon in boot camp and the Drill Instructors (one white, one black and one hispanic) used to give the black recruits holy hell about their behavior and speech.   Back then, blacks had the &#8220;black walk&#8221; which was really more like a limp and they would swing their arms wildly.  The Drill Instructors literally had to teach them how to walk like white people so that they could march in formation.  Pretty funny.  </p>
<p>Blacks know that too many blacks in any organization, business, neighborhood, will ruin it.  Blacks know that but many liberal whites do not.  </p>

		<p>Seventy-seven percent of senior officers in the active-duty military are white, while only 8 percent are black, 5 percent are Hispanic and 16 percent are women, the report by an independent panel said, quoting data from September 2008.</p>
<p>8% are black&hellip;considering blacks are 13% of the population and their criminal background sounds like 8% is pretty close right.<br>

<p>What exactly is it do you want to win? The US should be invading Iraq,Afghanistan,Libya and Iran. These wins you want are precisely the problem. They go hand-in hand with the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority at home and in the military.</p>
<p>What I want is a majority Native Born White Military guarding America&rsquo;s borders. If the US military becomes majority post-1965 nonwhite, nonwhites will have the power and force to race-replace a Native Born White minority permanently-and this will include all the discriminaion and violence that will come with racial minority status. And there will be nothing Native Born White Americans can do it about it&hellip;Muslim Europe won&rsquo;t be rushing in defending White Folks.</p>
<p>There was no justification for attacking and occupying Iraq and Afghanistan. All that had to be done is to shut all Muslim legal immigration down to 0..forever..and commence the deportation of all the &#8220;nice&#8221; muslims.  If the 1965 Immigration Reform Act had not been passed, 9/11 never would have occured.  It is all about race-replacing the Native Born White Majority with-among other post-1965 high fertility immigrant groups-with high fertility Muslim immigrants. The is obvious.</p>

<p>Female protests?  Who cares.  That&rsquo;s not the real issue here.  </p>
<p>The issue is risking our white children&rsquo;s lives in a Third World hell-hole which some bureaucrat tells us &#8220;is a threat to American interests.&#8221;   I&rsquo;ll be damned if one of my white children dies in any illegal overseas war directed by unintelligent nonwhites, in countries that are NO THREAT and of NO USE to us.  The ultimate goal may be to admit more refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, it wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me one bit.</p>
<p>A return to the draft?  Only if you and anyone else who promotes a draft is put on the front lines first and made to stay there until the overseas war is over, which it never will be despite what Obama or any other politicians promise. Politicians love war, even though it is the most expensive single thing any government can do.  What do the politicians care, Obama will give the order to the Ben BerNACH to fire up the printing press.</p>
<p>The overtly antiwhite American government is no friend to whites and I would recommend to all whites everywhere NOT to serve or represent the &#8220;interests&#8221; of this government anywhere, let alone risk life and limb.  Let them recruit a nonwhite Third World army, which they&rsquo;re already doing, to fight their illegal overseas wars.</p>
<p>Read #5 CDEs post very carefully and then read it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Join the NRA and fight to maintain your 2nd amendment rights. We will end up having to defend ourselves when the chips are down. The military will end up a failed experiment in political correctness. Its a bad joke to think minorities, gays, and women will competently defend western civilization. It will probably be necessary to go back to the old state militia system and bypass the military entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;new, improved&#8221; military not only won&rsquo;t defend western civilization, they won&rsquo;t defend you and may indeed turn their weapons on us white Americans which is what I believe will happen</p>

		<p>My uncle Paul was on the Cab Board in Nashville, which at the time did not allow women to drive a cab at night. Federal Judge Tom Wiseman heard a lawsuit from a woman cab driver that wanted to work at night and ruled that she had the civil right to do so. My uncle pleaded with the judge that it was too dangerous for a man and most certainly for a young woman. The Cab Board was ordered to put her to work at night and she was horribly raped and murdered within two weeks. My uncle called the judge and told him, &#8220;Now she has her civil rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>I suspect the same thing would be true to women in the military serving in combat. We have actually seen what to expect during the invasion of Panama. Women are permitted to serve in MP (military police) units and when exposed to gunfire, they ran like scalded dogs, leaving their male counterparts to carry on the fight without them. What else would you expect them to do?</p>
<p>A good many men are going to be killed trying to help or save women, too scared to run, if they are allowed into combat arms or anywhere close to the actual fighting. Don&rsquo;t bore me with movies of superwoman. They are exactly the same ones you already know.<br>

<p>#24: &ldquo;Whatever you call it, women in combat=genocide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except for Russia in WWII where 8% of Soviet front-line combatants were women; they made the best snipers and fighter pilots. Behind the lines, Yugoslav, Polish, and Greek partisans made wide use of women in combat roles. And then there was Vietnam: The Viet Minh and Viet Cong used women extensively as infantry (you couldn&rsquo;t ask for better sappers and snipers). Remind us again please, who won those three wars?&#8221;</p>
<p>I lived in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and witnessed a great deal of history being made.  I also saw on the spot reports, and heard many first person reports.  There was one solitary group of Bosnian females who called themselves, &#8220;The Bluebirds.&#8221;  They stood out not so much for combat effectiveness, but for fewer causalities under fire.  Draw your own conclusions.  </p>
<p>I also know my military history.  So I wonder where you are getting your stats?  During WW2 Russian women did serve as snipers, but were not the best by any report we have.  One famous case, made into a movie the female sniper romanticized in the film was actually struck in the face by the MALE acclaimed best Russian sniper of WW2, Vassily Zaitsev for panicking and getting another team member killed.  In WW1, the famous Russian female soldier is solely represented by a 300 woman unit that was commanded by Maria Bochkareva.  She named it, The Women&rsquo;s Battalion of Death.  A largely fictionalized report made by the Bolsheviks at the time claimed that they captured 2,000 Austrian troops.  The myths of this battalion also includes a claim that male Russian troops beat them up after they captured the 2,000 troops to dissuade them from carrying on because &#8220;they feared reprisals from the Germans against Russian women.&#8221;  Likely, eh?   It turns out that Bochkareva made a career after the war of telling stories like these on the Western university lecture circuits making claims that historians have soundly debunked since.  The one real report we have on them comes from a nurse named Florence Farmborough, to whose field hospital the female combatants who survived at Seret retreated.  She writes in her diary; &#8220;In honour of those women volunteers, it was recorded that they did &#8220;go over the top.&#8221;  But not all of them.  Some remained in the trenches, fainting and hysterical; others ran or crawled back to the rear.  Bachkarova retreated with her decimated battalion; she was wrathful, heart-broken, but she had learnt the great truth; women were unfit to be soldiers.&#8221;  (From The First World War; A Complete History, Martin Gilbert, Merton College, Oxford).</p>
<p>But to be complete, what military historians note as in the case of the Bluebirds in the 1990s Yugoslavian wars there are cases for women in combat.  During the Albigensian Crusades, crusade leader Simon de Montefort was killed during the Siege of Toulouse by a boulder shot from a catapult, manner by a female team.  The siege of Haarlem (The Netherlands) during the Spanish War of Succession was lead by a very large, bombastic female.  What do the successful female combat roles have in common?  It is that women are effective in DEFENSIVE warfare.  The civilian population in South Vietnam fought a defensive war in a jungle, so no doubt, some of the combatants and sappers were female.  But when U.S. troops killed them, it was considered a War Atrocity.  So when America is invaded (or whatever), we will be able to count on all those Feminazis in NOW and in all those cushy government jobs to join their factions in the street to engage in house to house combat.  They will go in, thinking they are Zena, Wonder Woman, or one of those women on CSI (or wherever on the dial you choose) and kick some male behind.  I am asserting that reality will play out different than the enormous, fluffed up, ego-maniacal, female warrior myths made so common in The West during the past 40 years.</p>

<p>While I agree with your concerns, I must assert that this issue brings up a large plethora of issues, all of which bear discussion, comparing, etc., in illustrating what is wrong with our present and proposed military and government establishment.  For myself, I really resented it in 1970, when I had to register for the draft and worry about Vietnam when my female counterparts had no concern, but were already spouting speeches about women&rsquo;s rights and their inherent equality, even superiority.  </p>

<p>&hellip;&#8221;Soviet front-line combatants were women; they made the best snipers and fighter pilots.&#8221;</p>
<p>A WW2 fighter requires quite a bit of muscle to fly, let alone hold still before taking off.</p>
<p>1,000 Russian women served as combat pilots during WW2. Most flew as bombers, the few who became fighter pilots, were not the best, but did become aces before being killed in combat.  They flew as fighters late in the war, after most of the experienced Germans were gone.  Most air combat went on in the Western front.  Soviet air mostly did fighter-bomber work (bombing and strafing).  As far as the best snipers, I found that while about 2,000 Russian women were used as snipers in WW2, they succeeded while the USSR was on the defensive.  German snipers became more successful once the Russians went on the offensive.  Consulting the data I pasted below, it is obvious that Vasily Zaitzev was the best Russian and WW2 sniper.  Some sites only use Zaitzev&rsquo;s Stalingrad 224 kills when comparing to Pavlenchenko&rsquo;s 309 wartime kills).</p>
<p> Bodycount? Effect<br>
on the battlefield? Most strategic shot? Longest shot? Many factors go<br>
into the equation.</p>
<p>    * The Soviets probably had the finest snipers in WW2, as a group. Vasilli Zaitsev with 224 kills at Stalingrad alone and more than 400 kills in all (some say more than 500) is surely ranked in the top tier. Ludmilla Pavlichenko ranks as the best woman sniper with 309 or<br>
      more kills.<br>
    * Simo Hayha of Finland is credited with more than 500 kills (by sniper, 200 more with an SMG) during only 100 days, in the Winter War.<br>
    * Billy Singh of the Australian Light Horse would be the top WW1 sniper.<br>
    * Carlos Hathcock, USMC during Vietnam, is legendary for (among other things) setting a world record (longest range confirmed kill, stood for 40 years), shooting and killing an enemy sniper through the scope and crawling through 1000 yards of heavily defended enemy territory to eliminate a Viet Cong general on one of his first missions. </p>
<p>Actually, the greatest sniper of WW1 is Francis &#8220;Peggy&#8221; Pegahmagabow, a Canadian sniper who earned 378 confirmed kills.</p>

 What&rsquo;s with the use of the word &#8220;tragedy&#8221; to describe atrocities and crimes? A tragedy would have been if the 13 people were killed in a bus accident or if the roof had collapsed and killed them. The shootings in Tuscon weren&rsquo;t a tragedy, they were mass murder.A tragedy would have been a gas main explosion in the mall parking lot. September 11th wasn&rsquo;t a tragedy.  &#8220;New Speak&#8221; is with us today.</p>
<p>2. The Roman Army became overloaded with Barbarian mercenaries who had no stake in the preservation of the Empire which was one factor in its collapse.  Our services are full of diverse people, gang bangers from all the barrios of the US, Muslims, all of whom are getting first class combat training so that they can kill more police while home on leave or after their discharge. Also they can kill their own troops while &#8220;in theatre&#8221; . How about the Black Muslim who rolled the grenade into the tent and killed ? officers in Iraq!</p>

		<p>Back in the early 1990&rsquo;s, the command staff at the University of South Carolina Naval ROTC was all white (except for a Hispanic Gunnery Sergeant). This was definitely not the case with the Army ROTC. I&rsquo;m not sure about any blacks who imploded while in this program; most tended to wash out the first year, but there were a couple of Hispanics who had some real issues. One was brought in through BOOST and somehow made it through the first year. In his second year, he was caught stealing from a grocery store (by ringing up non-existent purchases and shaving the price off of beer and other things for his buddies). He was booted out and sent back to the fleet. Another guy came in through an Enlisted Commissioning Program, graduated and was selected for flight school. While at flight school, he tried to pick up the daughter of a LCDR (O-4) and had sex tapes in his car. He was allowed to resign instead of facing a court martial. A few years later, he was arrested in Georgia for four murders and a series of rapes. This man is probably sitting on death row, and if not, he will be carried out of prison in a box. </p>
<p>Where there whites who were useless, certainly, but you don&rsquo;t have the same percentages who just implode while on active duty. I would say to avoid the military at all costs right now. If all the whites bailed out, it would make your head spin to see how quickly it would fall apart. You are not going to have a lot of blacks with a functional 8th grade education make it through Electronics Technician (or some equally tough) &#8220;A&#8221; school. You read those stories of how the South African military is falling apart, this will be the same.  </p>

<p>But then, if this is what the Majority of the idiots in this Country are voting for, let&rsquo;s just say to hell with our Military defense, and all things great about our Nation, as it decays into a Third World State. Who cares, right? </p>

		<p>Reference comments from anonymous 45,  you are factually incorrect.  The best snipers and fighter pilots in the Soviet military during WW2 were men.  They easily had the highest number of kills.  The few women veterans who served in combat for Russia had so many problems physically and mentally when they returned home that after the war, the Soviet military became virtually all male and no women were put in combat units.<br>
        <br>
During the same war European countries did use women in the resistance movement but the vast majority were used in non combat positions like smuggling, signal intelligence and spying.</p>
<p>The Viet Cong did use women in limited numbers for combat operations but did so due to manpower shortages and desperation.  The same reason certain third world societies use children in war.  The North did set up an all female unit for fighting but there were so many defections and desertions that they had to disband it.</p>
<p>The Israelis tried using women in combat in the 1950&rsquo;s but had so many problems with them that they took them out of combat units and to this day do not use women in fighting roles.  As one Isreali general said &#8220;we do not use women in combat, we have to take war more seriously than that.  </p>
<p>Finally, of the 4 thousand societies that anthropologists have identified throughout recorded history, all have been male dominated and with a hand full of rare exceptions used men exclusively in their wars.  You do not make policy based on a few unusual women. You base it on the norm, otherwise you could find a few 60 year old men who are still good enough to fight in combat or a few 15 year old children who are mature and physical enough to fight in war.  Should they also be allowed to join our military and fight if they so choose?  How low do you go and where do you draw the line?</p>

<p>I must disagree when you say we were not justified in attacking Afghanistan. Heck, that country gave aid and comfort to al-Qaeda. Their terrorists attacked New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania, on 9-11-01. Our Constitution says, &#8220;&hellip;an attack upon one state shall be considered an attack upon all&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>We should have finished the job in Afghanistan, but Bush, in his idiocy, then went into Iraq. He fell into the same quicksand that consumed other heads of state,  in fighting a two-front war. </p>

		<p>If minorities have now become our new royalty, why not expect that royalty will once again expect to lead armies in battle.  <br>
Poblem is that armies led by any privileged class are beaten by armies led by men who best rose through the ranks.  </p>
<p>Is anyone surprised that the leader of this commission was black?  And does anyone believe that whoeever appointed him and the rest of the commission didn&rsquo;t already know exactly what this commission&rsquo;s &#8220;independent report&#8221; would be as soon as they appointed its members?  There&rsquo;s democracy at work, boys and girls.  Or it&rsquo;s just that military brass that doesn&rsquo;t fight in real wars sees no value in respecting the truth about how to win them.      </p>
