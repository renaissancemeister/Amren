<h1>SBPDL Year One: 365 Days in Black Run America is Available on Amazon</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Press Release, SBPDL, Feb. 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Collecting the best articles from the first year of the popular blog Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like, the 350-page book will help educate people on the many misunderstandings they have of the Black community.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Black people are loud at movies? Have you ever wondered why Black people don&rsquo;t tip? Have you ever wondered why lawn jockeys no longer adorn the lawns of suburbia? Have you ever wondered why popular clubs have dress codes and businesses have &#8220;no loitering&#8221; signs?</p>
<p>Do you know what a Disingenuous White Liberal (DWL) or a Crusading White Pedagogue (CWP) is? How about Black Run America (BRA)?</p>
<p>By reading the more than 275 entries in SBPDL Year One these questions and many more regarding Black people will be answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;SBPDL Year One is an honest look at the stuff Black people don&rsquo;t like, document a group of people that voted 96 percent for President Obama in 2008 and supported him with an approval rating hovering around 95 percent during a time when Black unemployment was around 18 percent,&#8221; said Paul Kersey, the author of the blog and book.</p>
<p>Stuff Black People Don&rsquo;t Like Year One covers the rise of the Tea Party, the real reason people opposed the implementation of universal health care, the first murder free month in Newark in more than 40 years, and the collapse of former great American cities such as Detroit, Atlanta and Birmingham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only in a nation governed by the principles of Black Run America could a harmless PA prank at Wal-Mart turn into a national scandal, where someone daring to say that all Black people must leave the store becomes an instant pariah,&#8221; Kersey said</p>

		<p>That blog has consistently put out top notch ideas and entries. I&rsquo;m glad to see the author(s?) decided to put out a book. I hope it gets a lot of buys. </p>
<p>I have shared links to normal friends and the writing is engaging and clever. Some of the early entries are written in a manner that isn&rsquo;t too threatening. </p>

		<p>Okay, I went to the blog and read the &#8220;Why Black People Don&rsquo;t Tip&#8221; thing.  I was curious because my daughter is working as a waitress while finishing her degree; she has mentioned how the hostess at her restaurant is under constant pressure to distributes black patrons evenly between the various waitresses, so that no one waitress is disproportionately hurt by this phenomenon.</p>
<p>What tripe!  The tendency not to tip is somehow passed down via DNA because of past slavery in various cultures?  (We should not forget that most white people have servitude in their family histories as well.)  Relevant issues such as ignorance, rudeness, disrespect and racism are not even seriously considered.  I work for a manufacturing company in Memphis, Tennessee, that hires a lot of workers from the local black community.  All of our floor managers end up disrespecting black culture after working here for six months are more.  (You learn a lot about people and their values when you have to work with them in a factory like ours.)  I am so tired or reading things that are supposedly trying to address the pervasive failures of black culture in America only to find yet another litany of politically-correct platitudes.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;How about Black Run America (BRA)?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The subtle joke (or maybe not so subtle joke) about Black Run America, is that most blacks think that is exactly what they want. It would of course be an orgy of the rabid murder and rape of whites and even others, at first. Then of course like most extravaganzas of: violence, debauchery, and concentrated intoxication, things go wrong. One is confronted with the reality of life (or even pure existence,) as opposed to brief moments of rapturous feeling or being simply lost in a phantasmal imbecilic stupor! </p>
<p>The paradox of any hypothesized or hypnotized Black Run America, will resemble at best Dante&rsquo;s Inferno and at worst Detroit or Zimbabwe. It is what they &ldquo;think&rdquo; they want, but what should in reality be what they should most fear.  Go figure, when considering the enriching African contributions of both history and science. </p>
<p>As always, God help us all!</p>

		<p>4 Mister Freeman:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with the webmaster of Thug Report.  I won&rsquo;t say his name here, because it&rsquo;s not publicized too widely on TR.  But I will say that, based on his previous time as a local talk radio host in St. Louis, he used to be sort of a neo-con on race.  But even while he was, he still spearheaded the nickel-and-dime campaign against expanding light rail into St. Louis&rsquo;s newer suburbs, and the light rail was rejected at the polls in spite of the other side spending six figures.</p>

<p>For some more information, here&rsquo;s a service industry workers blog on that very subject.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s just true. Black people don&rsquo;t tip&rsquo;.<br>
<a href="https://www.igotstiffed.com/41/its-just-true-black-people-dont-tip/" rel="nofollow">https://www.igotstiffed.com/41/its-just-true-black-people-dont-tip/</a> </p>
<p>It seems from the comments, that even fellow blacks don&rsquo;t like serving other blacks for the same reason.<br>
Poverty can&rsquo;t be the reason, for instances billionaire golfer Tiger Woods was a infamously bad/non tipper along with the other stereotypes he ended up embodying.<br>
There is no escaping your own nature.</p>

		<p>JOHN pm makes a good point:</p>
<p>whites are never confused about what to do with other white people whose IQs are below 80 or so:</p>
<p>they are less than fully competent, and should not be allowed to make major decisions, should not have children, should not drive cars, should not own firearms, run school boards, become police chiefs, et cetera.</p>
<p>the confusion begins when white people are confronted by black people with IQs in the same range:</p>
<p>they are somehow expected to become NASA scientists and neuroscientists, and if they do not, than white people feel responsible.</p>
<p>treating retards and children as though they were competent adults, giving them what they want, means catastrophe by definition.</p>
<p>here&rsquo;s what most blacks want:</p>
<p>to square the circle:</p>
<p>to enjoy the benefits of a civilization which they collectively cannot maintain and could never have devised for themselves (because the number of mentally competent blacks is simply too small, and is swamped by the majority of incompetence),</p>
<p>while at the same time cultivating the illusion that they can take charge of it and make it better.</p>
<p>the idea that blacks on average are on par with whites in terms of mental ability in the capacity for civilized behavior is the ultimate insanity, and is moreover something blacks could never have thought up by themselves in a million years.</p>
<p>I suspect that when competent, intelligent, knowledgeable, and educated blacks speak candidly amongst themselves, they knowledge all of the above as a matter of course.</p>
<p>I believe they shake their heads in amazement at the craziness of white people and their illusions about the potential of the black underclass.</p>

		<p>There is another black phenom that I know all AmRen readers are familiar with.  Ever notice how blacks back into parking places?  I work in a Memphis hospital and there is a parking garage where we park.  Smooth traffic through the garage gets disrupted when blacks take the traffic-hindering move to back into a parking place.  I have yet to see a black drive headfirst into a parking place in that garage.</p>

		<p>My ex-girlfriend was a server for a major chain restaurant. All the servers had a name for blacks: Spodas, witch is short for, &#8220;I spoda tip!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was a drag whenever a server got stuck with a table of blacks - then and now.</p>

		<p><i>Ever notice how blacks back into parking places?</i></p>
<p>I dunno&hellip; How do <i>you</i> drive into a parking space ? I back into it. It&rsquo;s more difficult to do than going head first, but it&rsquo;s the correct thing to do, and it&rsquo;s what the traffic regulations mandate. At least in the country I&rsquo;m writing this from.</p>
<p>Going head first is the lazy man&rsquo;s method. The problem, when doing that, is you complicate considerably the next step : taking the car out of the parking space. Backing out of it, you will lack visibility to incoming cars. When backing into an empty parking space, on the other hand, you are sure that no other car will cross your way.</p>
<p>Mind you, I&rsquo;m mainly thinking of underground parking here, where the problem is compounded by walls. But the basic logic also applies to an outside parking lot.</p>
<p>Therefore, I&rsquo;m rather surprised that blacks do not park head first. That would seem to be more in line with their propensity to rush for the low-hanging fruits, as opposed to taking the harder path now, in order to reap a benefit later.</p>

		<p>I have worked for tips during my lifetime. I often encountered the phenomenon of black people not tipping. I know some whites will not tip a black waiter/waitress or delivery driver, at least not as generously as they would tip a white person.</p>
<p>I had thought on this subject. If the black person did not tip me, but tipped a black worker more, that might even things out over the course of the year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was not always what happened. Many blacks did not tip, or tipped very cheaply even in the case of workers of their own color. Lots of white customers were stiffs too, but the rate seemed much higher among blacks. Another instance of not going along with the system of society.</p>

<p>I do also.  Actually, that is what is taught in AAA and other safe driving courses.  I haven&rsquo;t noticed blacks (or many other people) do it, however.</p>
