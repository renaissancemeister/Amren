<h1><a href="http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-world-europe/20110314/EU.Italy.Migrants.Le.Pen/">Far-Right Leader Says Europe Can&rsquo;t Handle Migrants</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Patricia Thomas, Comcast News, March 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Marine Le Pen, the daughter of France&rsquo;s longtime far-right leader who now heads his National Front party, on Monday advocated turning migrants back to sea before they can reach European shores after she toured a center for illegal migrants on Italy&rsquo;s southernmost island of Lampedusa.</p>
<p>A group of young protesters yelled &#8220;racist&#8221; at Le Pen as she toured the island, where some 8,700 north Africans have fled unrest that has spread from Tunisia to Egypt and Libya since January.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Europe is impotent and has not come up with any solution,&#8221; Le Pen said. Instead of patrolling near European shores, she said Europe&rsquo;s navies &#8220;in reality .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. should go as close as possible to the coasts from where the clandestine boats departed to send them back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Europe, she said, cannot handle the influx, which &#8220;is adding poverty to poverty, and disorder to disorder.&#8221;</p>
<p>She warned that the migrants were arriving &#8220;in proportions that Italy can no longer handle.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Fact is that there are agreements between Italy and other member states of the EU which mandates that &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; are to be divided up between the member states soon after arrival in Italy which is one of the main entry points in to the EU. This means illegal immigration is a dilemma not only for Italy but for EU members like Germany or France etc as well.</p>

		<p>How unbelievable to presently ask the question, can Western Civilization be saved in time?  It is estimated that in this country by 2050, one out of every third person will be a hispanic = third world country.  Is this intentional planned by the global elitists against the common man, yes.  The common man in the western world is having more and more of his wealth and power be taken away by these elitists.  The latest subprime debacle is the latest attempt to take away wealth from the middle class by creating money out of thin air.  Wealth is more and more concentrated in the hands of the few.  The presently allowed massive influx of uneducated third world peoples is used to dilute the white majority and to cause an economic burden to destroy the middle class living standard therefore indirectly, taking power and wealth away at the same time.</p>

		<p>What do these protesters want, &#8220;Camp of the Saints?&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;refugees&#8221; should be treated humanely, then brought back to whence they came.  Europe owes them nothing - their problems arose from their own governments failures.  Similar to our Mexican problem.</p>
<p>Similar problems came about due to the massive invasion of the Goths in the Fourth Century, who initially came as refugees fleeing the Huns.  See &#8220;The Day of The Barbarians, by A. Barbero, the story of the battle of Adrianople in August 378, when the cream of the Roman army was wiped out by refugees that the Emperor Valens had voluntarily let in only two years before.  They never left, and over the next hundred years, helped to completely bring down the Western (Roman) Empire.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of Jean Raspail&rsquo;s great book, The Camp of the Saints. This is what Italy is facing today - a horde of destitute people who wish to overrun the West and steal our riches.</p>
<p>What will Italy do? Will Italians invoke the spirit of Scipio Africanus, Julius Caesar, and Giuseppe Garibaldi? I can only hope. </p>
<p>The Interior Ministry of Italy today rejected a ship carrying 1,800 Moroccans from Libya (yes, I wrote this correctly. Moroccans from Libya).</p>
<p>Others were allowed to come in. I don&rsquo;t understand why. </p>
<p>The government has repeatedly begged the European Union for assistance, for coordinated effort, but obviously, to no avail. Berlusconi has always considered himself a loose cannon of international politics. Why doesn&rsquo;t he just say &#8220;to hell with this, we will secure our borders&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Of course Europe cannot handle the immigrants.  Germany, in comparison of size, is closest to Wisconsin.  Their population is over 80 million, which is more than twice the amount of California.  Other countries in Europe are not much different.</p>
<p>People say that Europe&rsquo;s natives are dwindling.  I think that it is an issue of space and subconscious, like Japan.  All these countries are overpopulated and need to shrink a little.</p>
<p>throw in the fact that these people can&rsquo;t speak the native language and probably can&rsquo;t count to ten in their only sweetens the deal.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care if there were only 100,000 people in Germany, Europe is for Europeans.</p>

		<p>A number of years ago I read how the Russian Spetsnaz managed to land on a Swedish beach, sneaked right up to the Royal Family&rsquo;s residence in a kidnapping &#8220;dry run&#8221; and left without being detected.  Granted that Sweden isn&rsquo;t the most heavily armed nation and the Swedish King not the most important head of state but impressive none the less.  Assorted special forces might be the only way that European countries may be able to reclaim their nations through &#8220;ethnic cleansing&#8221; of the non-European populatons since the main-stream military organizations are controlled by liberal race-traitor politicians.  </p>

		<p>We have prevented the arrival of the Moroccan ship from Lybia because it&rsquo;s a &#8220;regular&#8221; ship, not a 8 or 9 meter long boat filled with desperate people. We are not sure if, when docked for some hoursin our port, peeple would flee from the ship, then aasking for asylum. The situation is worsening. I know Gheddafi is a dictator and I don&rsquo;t like him a bit, but Lybia was calm and people had ceased to arrive in our country until the unrest began.<br>
Perhaps there is a design behind all that North African unrest. I mean: create un unrest in order to flee to Europe and get in more easily. </p>

		<p>&#8221; The waves of refugees, many of them in the form of boat people crossing the Mediterranean to flee from chaos in Tunisia, Libya, and possibly Egypt will cause severe social dislocations in countries like Italy, France, Greece, Spain, Malta, and elsewhere. The expense of dealing with these refugees is already increasing tensions inside the European Union, another development which the Anglo Americans are happy to promote.&#8221;</p>

<p>I respectfully disagree! I think &#8220;refugees&#8221; should be treated as the diseases they are and treated horribly, even to torture and murders. They are NOT GOING TO RETURN to where they came from. These &#8220;refugees&#8221; are going to continue their criminal activity, their usual muslim antics (and these refugees ARE muslim) and worse!! most will end up in America which is the true target of islam. </p>

<p>The people of Europe are probably on a par with the US white population in that both areas have FAR too many deniers of the problems caused by multiculturalism.  And both are on the verge of large scale financial implosion.  Among about two dozen other indicators that foretell of the coming economic disaster, the one stat that stands out the most is the one I read just about five minutes ago:  Housing starts are the lowest EVER in recent history.</p>
<p>If employers here would refuse to hire illegals, the jobs available for illegals would quickly dry up.  As it stands now, the biggest threat to this country if the country melts down economically is the millions of illegals overburdening the system, which will eventually lead to large scale conflict.</p>
<p>Europe is a bit more advanced in its dislike of foreigners as the following video shows:</p>

That&rsquo;s black history, folks!</p>
<p>So is the Knoxville Horror, the Wichita Massacre, the Eve Carson Tragedy, the Zebra Killings, and whatever Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpie Sharpton, and the &#8220;Honorable&#8221; civil rights icon John Lewis say on any given day that keeps us firmly entrenched in our justified prejudices.  </p>

		<p>The analogy of the Roman Empire post-Adrianople is apt. We are seeing today the mass migrations of peoples from the third world into the first. But at least the Romans saw something of a threat way back when, and attempted to counter the interlopers, though were not militarily strong enough to do so. </p>
<p>The annoyance is that the Western world <i>is  </i>strong enough militarily to deal with the new wave of invaders. But lacks the political will to do so. Then again, we can look at the abject failure of NATO (including the USA!) to deal with the Somali pirates  &mdash;  whose military strength is limited, to put it mildly. What on earth is the point of Western nations spending hundreds of billions of dollars on &#8220;defense&#8221; if the armed forces will not be employed to fight their enemies?</p>
<p>All goes back to the paralysis of will.</p>
<p><i>Is this intentional planned by the global elitists against the common man, yes. The common man in the western world is having more and more of his wealth and power be taken away by these elitists. </i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same old story. Elites using the underclass against the middle. Given the general prosperity of Europe, the underclass now has to be imported.</p>
<p>Then again, look at how global elites brought down Rhodesia and South Africa. These were countries which maintained a modicum of Western culture, as well as control over their own resources and economies. Their White governments were replaced with clients who are now integrated with the transnational economic order. Their resources are open to exploitation, and their populaces reduced to another demoralized worker pool, headed for third world status (fourth world for Zimbabwe). </p>
<p>South Africa is simply the Western world on a small scale: a minority of white peoples (and their allies) against an exploding third world populace. The end of apartheid has also been the end of civil order and economic stability. It&rsquo;s what will happen in the rest of the West.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is how the global economic order is given ideological justification by the left. It is liberal ideology, leftist activists, and progressive NGOs who provide the intellectual muscle for open borders and cleaning up the last enclaves of Western nationalism.</p>
<p>The question is: how does one counter an ideology? Kill the ideology, and remove the underpinnings of the transnational world order. </p>

<p>&#8220;What do these protesters want, &ldquo;Camp of the Saints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; should be treated humanely, then brought back to whence they came. Europe owes them nothing - their problems arose from their own governments failures. Similar to our Mexican problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our Mexican Problem is largely due to greedy capitalists in America, and drug abuse in America, along with soft policies that anyone needing to survive with any sense would take advantage of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similar problems came about due to the massive invasion of the Goths in the Fourth Century, who initially came as refugees fleeing the Huns. See &ldquo;The Day of The Barbarians, by A. Barbero, the story of the battle of Adrianople in August 378, when the cream of the Roman army was wiped out by refugees that the Emperor Valens had voluntarily let in only two years before. They never left, and over the next hundred years, helped to completely bring down the Western (Roman) Empire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe you ought to read a little more of this history.  Who&rsquo;s calling who a barbarian?  Valens only became Emperor because his predecessor Jovian was asphyxiated while on his way to Constantinople.  Valintinian was incidentally with him on this trip.  Valintinian was then appointed Emperor.  Valintinian  ruled in Rome and set Valens to rule the Eastern Empire.  Both brothers are reported to have been &#8220;earnest Christians.&#8221;  Interesting also to note that Valens was an Arian Christian while his brother was a Nicene.  Jovian had a cousin who made an uprising against Valen&rsquo;s and had the Goths as allies (Many of these Goths were already Arian Christians, and Valens had allied with them to fight Pagan Goths earlier.  Perhaps these &#8220;barbarians&#8221; were more honorable than Valens?  The Goths were various the Germanic tribes and had served in the Roman army for a long time before, first as soldier-slaves given in tribute, later as mercenaries, and later still, the bulk of the Roman army.  The tribes in question here was the Visigoths. Some as mentioned had been converted to Arian Christianity and set to civil war against their own people by the Valens.  The Pagan Visagoths resisted Christianity as they naturally would have resisted an invasion of Huns.  Only the Christians learned Roman intriguing, to add to the force.  Valen&rsquo;s defeat at Adrianople was taken as a sign from God and Arian Christianity, long disputed by the Nicenes, (who had poisoned Arius himself during Constantine&rsquo;s rule), and Theodosius, the next emperor, endorsed Christianity and Arianism was made a heresy. </p>
<p>When a state becomes so corrupt as Rome did, it was bound to and should fall. Christian competition, combined with the old methods of gaining a throne in Rome through assassination combined to cause the fall.  Corruption of our government, regardless of the type, is certain to cause us to collapse.  It is the corrupt government that allows in all the &#8220;barbarians&#8221; for political reasons.  It is the laziness and corruption of the people, that allows the corruption of the government.  &#8220;The people have the government they deserve.&#8221; - Voltaire.  </p>
<p>One must be very careful when comparing modern events to earlier history.  History does repeat itself, but not in exactly the same ways, and it is easy to take the wrong lessons away.  I don&rsquo;t know this book you refer to, but all other history of the era including Gibbon, relates these well known events, and it may be searched on the web.  By the way, Valens and his brother were actually Illyrians, which is part of modern day Croatia.  The two were raised in Britain and Africa on estates owned by their father.</p>

<p>No, it is the incorrect one, as my previous post (which will hopefully get displayed) shows.  The Goths were not interlopers.  Valens persecuted the Visigoths first, and had some in his own army, which had converted to his Arian Christianity. In case you don&rsquo;t realize it, they were the Germans and WHITER than the Romans!  Rome invaded Northern Europe, then enslaved the whites and took them south.  They were slave Visigoth soldiers in Rome&rsquo;s army.  The Visigoths eventually were allowed to settle in Spain and merged with the Gothic tribes known as the Vandals, who were already settled there. (Sheesh)  And they went on serving in the Roman army until Rome&rsquo;s corruption led to their full takeover.  There&rsquo;s a reason why the Holy Roman Empire consisted of largely Germanic territory for a thousand years.</p>
<p> Rome went out to dominate the world, make it all Rome, and so it cannot be a surprise when its chickens come home to roost.  The Popes, was the new Caesars,went into Europe to reconquer with religious superstition combined with political intrigue.  Europeans have largely and finally rejected it, only to be faced with its angry little brother, Islam.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be relieved when the Christian epic is finally over.  When Pope is black and the Holy See moved to continental Africa, it will be historically finished.  And that day will come because The Church is the Great Whore John railed against in Revelations.  I just hope that we can also prevent a Muslim one to rise in its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;The annoyance is that the Western world is strong enough militarily to deal with the new wave of invaders. But lacks the political will to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nations who expand into other countries one way or another, cause ruin and suffering there, are responsible for it and cannot walk away - unless they are the real barbarians.</p>
<p><br>
France and Britain invaded and occupied North Africa, the Middle East, and much of Africa in the 19th century.  We have been meddling, exploiting and intriguing in just about every corner of the world since WW2.  Blatant hypocrisy dulls the political will.  It is the practical impossibility of the present situation that dicates that Europe stop the immigration.  But that means assisting there.  </p>
<p>We must decide at last; are we the Roman Empire?  If so, we must accept our fate when the &#8220;barbarians&#8221; finally break in to sack our city.  IF we are not, then we had better take different lessons from Roman history.  Those lessons are there to learn and for us to avoid.</p>

<p> Sorry to take so long to respond, but I just took a look at your posts.  Some of what you say is, as far as I know, factually correct, some I didn&rsquo;t know, and some I take issue with.  Yes, I was aware that Valens was an Arian, that his successor (in the West) united the Empire under the Catholic (or Nicene, as you call it) orthodoxy, probably for practical even more than religious reasons.  But Constantinople was primarily Catholic, not Arian, ad because of that and many other reasons, Valens was not popular and his death was not truly mourned.</p>
<p> My more important point was that these Goths who defeated Valens and the Romans at Adrianople were NOT the Goths that were serving in and trained by, the Roman Empire.  That happened with their fellow Goth, Alaric, about 30+ years later, after a large number had been absorbed into the army.  This group was moderately warlike, and, through circumstance (i.e., a surprise flanking attack by Gothic and Hun cavalry), Valens attempt to negotiate instead of fighting, and Roman tactics against a more fluid enemy, the battle was lost.  These Goths had come into Roman territory voluntarily - begging to come in -looking for bread, protection and land, and yes, some Goths joined who had been in the army, or were escaped slaves (the Goths took Roman citizens as slaves, also).  In three years they held large swaths of Thrace and </p>
<p>Also, I am aware that the Goths were a primarily Germanic tribe, and &#8220;WHITER than the Romans! &#8221;  So what? Their coloring was not necessarily seen as a plus by the Romans, who had developed the most advanced civilization and culture the world had ever known at the time. The Goths had no civilization, and a very rudimentary culture.  They mainly took from the areas they traveled through (and looted).  Considering what the Germans did to the white (European) race in the last century, I think the Romans had it right (and I&rsquo;m part German).</p>
<p> Don&rsquo;t let your anti-Christian bias blind you to the real threat we face on our southern border (or the Europeans on theirs).  The lesson of Adrianople is that the invasion has to be stopped at first flood; it may already be too late for us.</p>
