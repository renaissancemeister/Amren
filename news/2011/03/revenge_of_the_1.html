<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Brenda Nathan doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the perception of her chosen profession  &mdash;  she embraces it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m a complete nerd,&#8221; boasted the California Polytechnic State University mechanical engineering major, one of 8,000 young people attending the National Society of Black Engineers convention in downtown St. Louis last week. &#8220;I take pride in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The revenge of the nerds  &mdash;  as Nathan and other conventioneers can attest after four days of courtship by the nation&rsquo;s top corporations  &mdash;  is called job opportunity.</p>
<p>The student-led organization was to conclude its 37th annual meeting with a Saturday night concert by rapper-actor LL Cool J.</p>
<p>In addition to the job fair, the four-day event at America&rsquo;s Center featured symposiums on employment (&#8220;The Parallels of Job-Seeking and Dating&#8221;), personal enhancement (&#8220;Eliminating self-defeating behavior&#8221;) and abstruse engineering discourse (&#8220;Battle of the Frameworks: ITIL/Six Sigma/ISO 9000/CMMI&#8221;).</p>
<p>Organizers said the presence of 300 top-drawer exhibitors  &mdash;  Apple, Boeing, Intel, the CIA, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Honda, Facebook, General Mills and Wal-Mart to name just a few  &mdash;  represented more than an empty gesture to minority hiring. Several companies, in fact, reserved interview rooms off the convention floor with the express purpose of making on-the-spot offers to qualified candidates.</p>
<p>Fourth-year Hampton University electrical engineering major Taylor Armstead, {snip} is fully aware of the advantage of being a highly educated black candidate: &#8220;We&rsquo;re a hot commodity right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Nationally, 2 million people earn a living as professional engineers. Of those, the NSBE estimates 70,000 are African-American.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Seventy percent of the 10,000 black students who enroll as engineering majors each fall, he reports, don&rsquo;t make the cut. Mack [Carl Mack, executive director of the 35,000-member society] said it is incumbent on blacks in communities, along with schools, to turn young people on to math and science as a practical alternative to the minuscule odds of striking it big in sports or entertainment.</p>
<p>To Mack, the group&rsquo;s outreach effort is the not-so-simple task of getting enough kids, and their parents, to buy into the reality of education being its own reward.</p>

		<p>Through the grapevine, I have heard that most of these jobs offered at this fair were more &#8220;administrative&#8221; jobs within an engineering department (e.g. HR, Personnel, Diversity, etc.) than actual engineering jobs.</p>
<p>Pray tell, what kind of high level engineering does Wal-Martinez do such that they&rsquo;re hiring at engineering job fairs?</p>
<p><i>Seventy percent of the 10,000 black students who enroll as engineering majors each fall, he reports, don&rsquo;t make the cut.</i></p>
<p>A high percentage of whites who start out as engineering majors also don&rsquo;t make the cut.  So where are the engineering job fairs for white students?</p>

<p>I question that figure. They can get AA&rsquo;d through college, but they won&rsquo;t pass the PE exam by AA. Most black engineers go into some management position and don&rsquo;t actually design things. But there are a few good ones, to be fair.</p>

<p>Uh so 70 percent of the blacks which actually try to attempt to actually learn a useful trade in college end up dropping out, and saddled with student loan debt for years, while the more imbecilic, blacks who just enroll in &#8220;African American Studies&#8221; courses get straight As just for showing up occasionally, and are funneled into government work, guaranteed for life with full pension. </p>

		<p>Black engineers are beneficiaries of the unearned Diversity Privilege and they endanger us all.</p>
<p>Their black public school teachers changed test scores to pass them, were admitted to college without showing SAT scores in order to increase our much needed, valuable, enriching diversity, were given grade inflation to keep the diversity program from failing, were graduated from college with diversity privilege and not study, were given diversity privilege jobs in engineering firms that must hire diversity to get public work projects, and then, black engineers designed the highway bridges that you cross every day, and when they flunk even the basic corporate testing, they get inspection jobs and fudge the results so they can take off work early.</p>
<p>Why worry? What could go wrong? </p>

		<p>My experience in the engineering profession is to have witnessed a group of black college graduates seek to pass a tough certification program with unwavering standards, and all fail.</p>
<p>I do note with interest however the ingenuity of the Nigerian mechanical engineer Umar Farouk Abdul, hailing from one of that country&rsquo;s wealthiest families, who failed to take down Northwest Flight 253 when he could not light his underwear on fire.</p>
<p>Umar is a 2008 engineering graduate from the University College London.<br>

		<p>Black Engineers are a joke. I worked at IBM for 7 years as a test engineer and blacks were always doing everything half-arsed. Furthermore, there were no actual black hardware development engineers. Most were white and asian. Black engineers become project managers, or are found niche jobs that are not critical for the business. A hot commodity? hardly..</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no way there are 70,000 qualified black &#8220;engineers.&#8221;  No way.  It&rsquo;s just like the black &#8220;pharmacists&#8221; that are being pushed on us who could well kill someone with their incompetence.  They&rsquo;re strictly AA gimmies.</p>
<p>Greed mongering whites are endangering our neighborhoods to a degree that is criminal.</p>

		<p>Blacks seem to have false perception of society:<br>
	</p>
<p>	I&rsquo;m often attacked by blacks for citing research done by the U.S. Department of Education or the US Census Bureau; many people of color would like to suppress the embarrassing information contained in these studies; it&rsquo;s not popular to say that blacks have enjoyed 50 years of special treatment through affirmative action and numerous other social programs designed to compensate for their inadequacies, and blacks resent the fact that the U.S. Department of Education falls short of proclaiming the entire race retards, but the truth is black leaders are using these studies to ensure blacks continue to receive preferential treatment.</p>
<p>	Job preference and educational scholarships are no longer awarded on academic merit; they are given to those who descend from Latin America or African, ancestry without affirmative action these groups could not compete, with the White and Asian populations in the field engineering, architecture, mathematics, science, or any intellectual endeavor.</p>
<p>	The federal examinations for employment is a good example of affirmative action at work; blacks and others minorities are giving ten points, just to even the playing field and they still struggle to pass the test and if a black squeaks by and passes the test their often promoted to the level of their incompetence rendering them totally ineffective.</p>
<p>	In the global arena whites are the true minority, the white race is a society of free thinking individualist; nearly all the technological advancements can be directly correlated to the white race.<br>

Of course black engineers are in high demand.</p>
<p>Every business wants to show the embrace &#8216;diversity&rsquo;. Blacks who make it into engineering have shown they have some talent. Black engineers provide diversity and they&rsquo;re likely to have basic skills.</p>
<p>The demand comes from the fact there are few black engineers and every business wants them. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they finished first or last in their class, having [skilled] black employees protects the company against charges of racism.</p>
<p>If blacks could make it in engineering, they would have it made; IF they could make it in engineering&hellip;</p>

		<p>Some time ago, while at a community college, I was told a story of diversity gone horribly wrong by my math instructor.  This was VERY off the record. </p>
<p>This instructor earned his engineering degree in the early 1970&rsquo;s. For the first couple of years, he stated that his group was fantastic and he learned a lot. However, this was the era of Nixon/Ford &#8220;goals and timetables&#8221; and the government started pressuring this company to increase minority hiring. The company created a new management training program that would be staffed (exclusively) by newly hired minority trainees. Off to the campuses they went and a minority would probably be hired if happened to wander up to the recruiting table. The fellow who was eventually assigned to this engineering group we&rsquo;ll call Darnell. </p>
<p>This caused some hate an discontent up front because one of the resident engineers thought he might have a shot at being a manager of this group, not some kid fresh off the street. For the first three months or so, Darnell didn&rsquo;t really<br>
micromanage or cause a lot of problems. I&rsquo;m sure he realized that he was out of his league and decided that he was going to show these engineers who ruled the roost. Heaven only knows what set him off. Soon, memo after memo began flying out of his office concerning things such as &#8220;everything in writing that goes to another area must come through Darnell&#8221;. You must keep Darnell appraised of phone calls made to other groups, outside <br>
vendors, etc. Going to senior management requires approval from Darnell. Morale went in the toilet rather quickly. Finally, these guys started hitting their breaking points and making it a point to see the senior managers anywhere outside of Darnell&rsquo;s purview. The senior managers knew that most of these<br>
management trainees wouldn&rsquo;t have been hired to repair the typewriters a few years before, but that they couldn&rsquo;t fire them and risk the wrath of the EEOC.</p>
<p>To really poison the well, Darnell saw that one of his engineers had lunch with a senior manager (without his approval) and decided to confront the engineer. A shouting match ensued and Darnell threatened to fire the engineer. Well, the engineer beat him to the punch and quit on the spot. Pretty soon, others started bailing in droves and this company seemed to be left with nothing but brand new engineers and a few senior engineers who were a couple of years away from retirement. Product quality<br>
deteriorated and an otherwise well respected company began hemorrhaging red ink (and trained employees). From what my instructor told me, by the mid-1980&rsquo;s this company was bought out, stripped of any usable assets and discarded. </p>

		<p>Blacks are also a hot commodity in the U.S. government military contracting world here in the muddled east. Incompetence, rudness, entitlement mentality and in some cases, overt hostility coupled with a high turnover rate. When we loose a White co worker, he/she is replaced  with a black, when we loose a black worker, he/she is replace with 2 or more blacks (witnessed this personally). At one point on a project I am on now, of 53 U.S. citizen expats, only 7 were White (managers and supervisors) </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m white with a math degree. I&rsquo;ve been out of college several years. I cannot get a single job that wants a college degree, much less one that wants math. My co workers do not have degrees. I have never had a boss who has a degree. White job fairs don&rsquo;t exist. What am I doing wrong, how can I get a decent job?</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s all the white privilege that somehow magically prevents me from getting a job, even though I&rsquo;m white? Or maybe white privilege does not actually exist? Hmmmmmm&hellip;</p>

<p>ITIL, Six Sigma, ISO 9000, and CMMI are doctrines of &#8220;management science&#8221; - they have nothing to do with engineering.  But then the journalist - being a journalist, and therefore ignorant of the world around him - probably didn&rsquo;t know that.  Those vaunted management-guru buzzwords are the kind of thing that&rsquo;s destroying this nation - managers today all-too-often know nothing about the actual thing they manage - instead their heads are stuffed full of useless nonsense like Six-Sigma, ISO, &#8220;Who moved my cheese&#8221;, and all the rest of that loathsome trash.  However, those are the sorts of things that a useless, affirmative-action window-manager might learn to mouth, in the furtherance of the illusion that he does something useful and important.</p>

		<p>I recruited and hired engineers for many years as a corporate manager and vice president. We were always on the lookout for top talent. Twenty years ago we rarely saw any black engineers apply for positions. When they were hired (never by me) they were always poor performers, almost at the incompetent level. Now the environment has changed, with more black employees at corporations that are more diverse and multi-national in their outlook. But nothing that I have seen has changed with respect to black engineering performance. It is usually between abysmal and sub-standard. On occasion I have experienced a black program manager who was good, but that was about one in 100. Those are not very good odds when you have to compete on a world wide basis. It is no surprise that American companies have declined in economoic performance compared to European or Asian companies. The more diverse the work force, the worse things have become. </p>

		<p>I was a technical recruiter for a major telecom company, the Black engineers were less than worthless. But since we did work for the Feds, we had to have <br>
our quota of them. The stories I could tell. . We would fill our openings with caribbean blacks, who worked hard, spoke the King&rsquo;s english. The american blacks were simply a pain in the ass, and usually ended up in some supervisors role, or some sort of diversity make work position. none of them contributed anything</p>

		<p>As a white engineer at Boeing I have a displeasure of having my desk near a black engineer. Can not say very much about his engineering abilities as the amount of work he produces is minimal. Talking and laughing on the phone, spending hours at the company gym, coming to work very late etc. is the norm. <br>
I was told, in private conversation with other white engineers, to forget it: &#8220;he can not be fired and he knows it&#8221;.<br>
Of course, this is just a single example. I am sure other blacks make fantastic engineers. - sarcasm off.</p>

		<p>I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from a California State University in Southern California. As I recall, there were less than five blacks in the whole mechanical engineering department. The program is extremely rigorous. </p>
<p>The original article states &ldquo;But the transformation is under way in a profession once almost exclusively the domain of white males.&rdquo; Based on what I have seen, large companies are desperately trying to perform this &ldquo;transformation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At engineering job fairs I would notice many large companies such as Boeing, GE, Disney and Northrop tout their equal employment opportunity credentials. On their brochures they would highlight blacks and other non-whites and rarely showed white faces. I&rsquo;ll never forget the Boeing commercial that showed clips of several employees and the only white shown was a non-threatening older man in a wheelchair. I am baffled by the way the industry has turned their backs on white engineers. It was white engineers that designed and built the Saturn V rocket that sent a man to the moon and returned him safely to Earth.  Engineering has historically been very white, only recently have Asians been enrolled in great numbers – and many are foreigners on visas.<br>
 <br>
Since large corporations are actively trying to put white engineers in the back seat, I deliberately avoided them when seeking employment. I eventually decided to go with a smaller company that puts zero emphasis on minority hiring. I believe these large companies have the surplus resources to accommodate potentially unskilled AA hires –for now. As foreign competition grows with India and China, these AA hires will become an expensive liability. This will put smaller companies who employ the traditional white engineers at an advantage. <br>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, all the companies that remain within the United States no longer seek employees from the &#8216;best and brightest&rsquo; pools.  It&rsquo;s the youngest and cheapest regardless of capability.  Cheap imports are even more desirable.</p>
<p>Hey America, you wanted an unethical society.  You got one helluva beauty.<br>

Some of you are jumping the shark with your comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, lucky you.  You will at least concede, will you not, that our anecdotal experiences are at least as valid as yours?  I am familiar with several graduates of an HBCU institution, who were all pretty well useless.  One of them was a masters student in computer engineering who didn&rsquo;t know how to write a program.</p>
<p>Overall, in a twenty year career, I just haven&rsquo;t met too many black engineers or scientists.  Because there just aren&rsquo;t many.  Of the ones I have met, several have been incompetent.  A few of them may be okay - not having worked with them, I cannot say.  I am aware of none who are truly outstanding.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s MY experience, pal.</p>

<p>Actually, is it possible that AA hires serve to keep the bulk of the workforce in line? </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no engineer, but I worked at a company where diversity was pounded into us quite vigorously, and the message to us white males was clear: be glad you&rsquo;ve got your miserable job, because non-whites are the future. </p>
<p>Makes one reluctant to ask for raises, slow to ask questions about where management is taking the company, and, frankly, grateful for the opportunity to put in that 10- 12- hour day. </p>

		<p>Over a 40 year career as a mechanical engineer (I am now retired), I never met a black engineer who could pull his own weight. A few worked a little, but most were simple completely worthless. They were AA hires, they knew it, we all knew it, and there was no body fooling anybody.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Highly Educated&#8221; does NOT guarantee &#8220;Highly Qualified&#8221; or Highly Capable&#8221;.  With Affirmative Action degrees being handed out like food stamps a degree is losing the prestige it once had, which is sad for some who have posted here, who worked hard for their degrees.</p>
<p>At a company I worked for years ago a &#8220;black engineer&#8221; appeared.  It was somewhat a mystery just what this person was &#8220;engineering&#8221;.  There was suspicion he had been assigned coffee maker duty, or keeping the pencils in the department sharpened, and this was when everyone used mechanical pencils, and the designers and engineers had their own CAD work stations.  Ya think?</p>

<p>Proof!! or I doubt it. The most common phrase heard from people who are deathly afraid of being called racissssssssssss is &#8220;some of my best friends are black&#8221; to which I say &#8220;that may be true unless you are the only White and you along with your &#8220;best black friend&#8221; is with other blacks&hellip;Then in any altercation YOU will simply be the honkie!</p>

		<p>I could relate any number of experiences with black engineers, from getting away with cheating in school, to professionals whose coworkers redo their analyses behind their backs because they need accurate results to get their own projects done.</p>
<p>Now as a mid-level manager at a very large semiconductor company, I can say that I have personally seen: a) pay tables quantifying the amount of extra hiring bonus paid to &#8220;minorities&#8221;; b) specific dictates from HR about hiring &#8220;minorities&#8221; i.e. quotas, which are supposedly illegal; c) a white engineer&rsquo;s annual review downgraded by HR because they needed more non-minorities getting negative reviews; d) PhD-only requirements being dropped for minorities only; e) promotions being dictated from upper management outside the normal system, over the objection of the direct manager; f) negative messages being blocked by upper management the following year, when the newly-promoted minority is failing to meet job grade expectations.<br>
