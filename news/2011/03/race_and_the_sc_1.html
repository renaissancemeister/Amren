<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>
          <span class="dropcap">I</span>t would be tempting to think 
that science writing, with its emphasis on data and reproducible 
results, is relatively free from the woolly thinking about race so 
common elsewhere. It is true that there are still a few objective 
publications that accept papers from people like Philippe Rushton and 
Arthur Jensen, whose findings do not conform to racial orthodoxy. They 
are exceptions. The most influential science publications, such as <i>Science and Nature</i> are extremely cautious about violating current intellectual fashion, and &#8220;popular&#8221; publications like <i>Natural History</i> and <i>Scientific American</i> are firmly in the hands of dogmatic egalitarians (see article, <a href="#article2">All the Data Fit to Print</a> ).
        </p>
        <table class="boxright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <td><img src="../../../../ar/1997/06/chemlab.gif" alt="" height="111" width="300"/> </td>

        <p>
          Not surprisingly, the mid-level trade journals read by science
 workers follow the fashion. The Scientist, for example, is a 
well-regarded trade publication that bills itself as &#8220;the newspaper for 
the life sciences professional.&#8221; It appears twice a month, and runs 
announcements of research and teaching positions as well as ads for 
&#8220;pre-owned lab equipment,&#8221; &#8220;high quality antibodies and proteins,&#8221; 
&#8220;hazardous gas detection instruments,&#8221; and other specialist gear.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of its issues for Black History Month (formerly known as 
February) was devoted almost entirely to non-whites, with the four 
front-page articles covering the following subjects: why blacks are 
unwilling to serve as research subjects, how black churches can help 
recruit black research subjects, the dearth of non-whites in the biotech
 industry, and the means by which non-whites &#8220;demonstrate that success 
in science can come despite barriers.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          The first two of these articles deal with a real problem. In 
response to wide-spread claims that science &#8220;ignores&#8221; minorities, the 
National Institutes of Health and other major grant-making bodies now 
require that biological research include large numbers of non-white 
subjects. This is not easy, because so many blacks refuse to take part.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the first article points out, anyone who tries to recruit 
black subjects runs into a wall of suspicion, and nearly everyone <i>The Scientist</i>
 interviewed seems to think this is because science is so &#8220;white.&#8221; 
America needs more non-white scientists, if only to encourage blacks to 
act as research subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the most frequently offered explanation for black 
mistrust is the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. This was a nearly 40-year 
study, stopped only in 1972, in which U.S. government scientists charted
 the progress of syphilis in 400 Alabama black men. The men were 
deliberately left untreated so doctors could study the full course of 
the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this is the only recorded instance of this kind of 
government malfeasance, it stands as the definitive symbol of white 
medical research for many blacks and even a few whites. As Arthur 
Caplan, the director of the University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Center for 
Bioethics explains   &mdash;   without elaboration   &mdash;   &#8220;there&rsquo;s certainly been many,
 many areas where minorities have been exploited, mistreated, abused, 
and used by the research community.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          As <i>The Scientist</i> reports, the other thing blacks 
frequently say is that since AIDS was probably invented by the U.S. 
government to exterminate them, medical research cannot be trusted. 
Various people interviewed in the article have a breezy, ready-made 
explanation for this mortifyingly implausible point of view: Blacks do 
not have &#8220;equal access&#8221; to medicine. As James Bowman, a black professor 
of medicine at the University of Chicago explains, &#8220;As long as we have 
an inequitable health care system, minorities must be suspicious.&#8221; &#8220;If 
they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re foolish,&#8221; he adds sympathetically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kathleen Boozang, a Seton Hall University professor of 
unspecified race, draws slightly different conclusions from &#8220;unequal 
access&#8221;: &#8220;If you&rsquo;re asked to be a subject of research, but then aren&rsquo;t 
going to reap the benefits, why should you participate? It ultimately 
goes back to the structure of the health care system and the lack of 
access to it.&#8221; Thus we arrive at the doubtful but reportedly widely-held
 view that non-whites don&rsquo;t like to be research subjects because there 
is not enough free medicine for poor people. If they thought there was 
something in it for them they might take part.
        </p>
        <table class="quoteright">
          <tbody><tr>
            <th> The pages of virtually any black newspaper are filled with advertisements for psychics, faith healers, and good luck charms. </th>
          </tr>
        </tbody></table>
        <p>
          According to one black woman who is a genetics counselor, 
blacks are afraid of science in general because of books like <i>The Bell Curve.</i> &#8220;[It says] we&rsquo;re inferior. You have scientists or even educators saying this,&#8221; thus tainting the entire scientific enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these explanations for low black participation may 
have a grain of truth, but the main reason   &mdash;   never touched on by <i>The Scientist</i>
   &mdash;   is probably the nature of blacks themselves. Whites do not ordinarily
 agree to be part of a medical study only because they think the 
research will benefit them or their families. They care about the public
 good and take a long-term view of how to contribute to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are not traits particularly characteristic of blacks. 
High crime rates are the classic sign of a short-term view and contempt 
for society at large. But even among non-criminal populations, when 
people are matched by income blacks give much less to charity than 
whites do. Likewise, black neighborhoods are notorious for ignoring 
municipal recycling plans, and only with the greatest difficulty can 
blacks be made to participate in blood drives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blacks are much less likely to make their organs available for
 transplant, despite government campaigns to explain to them that blacks
 often can accept organs only from other blacks. At the same time, one 
of the most consistent racial differences in polling data is the extent 
to which blacks believe that government can solve all problems (a view 
that coexists with the fear that AIDS is an extermination tool). Society
 is there to help them and not the other way around. This is not the 
view of people who volunteer their time in the name of medical progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, anti-scientific superstitions are likely to be more 
common among blacks than whites. The pages of virtually any black 
newspaper are filled with advertisements for psychics, faith healers, 
numerology books, good-luck charms and other such mumbo jumbo. People 
who patronize faith healers may not have much interest in medical 
research.
        </p>
        <p>
          But given that   &mdash;   for whatever reason   &mdash;   blacks are such 
reluctant research subjects, scientists are looking for them everywhere.
 The latest hope seems to be to persuade black churches to help find 
subjects, but <i>The Scientist</i> reports that this is by no means the 
happy ending. To the chagrin of some scientists, many black preachers 
expect to be paid if they are to round up subjects. One puts it somewhat
 delicately but unmistakably: &#8220;If you want to change a church&rsquo;s agenda 
to fit something on your own agenda, you need to invest in the 
infrastructure of the church.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the research is on diseases like prostate cancer or 
hypertension, to which blacks are particularly prone, churchgoers are no
 more willing than anyone else to play the white man&rsquo;s game. As one 
black breast cancer activist explains, &#8220;[the research institutions] 
usually send a very well-meaning white woman or white man into the 
community to pitch the idea. The congregation is very polite, but the 
people have no intention of complying.&#8221; If whites do not have the sense 
to send black recruiters they are advised, at the very least, to spend a
 lot of time attending church services and community events so as to 
&#8220;build a comfort level.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Overcoming Barriers </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          The article about how non-whites manage to overcome &#8220;barriers&#8221;
 and become successes in science rather realistically points out that 
the biggest barrier is usually poor schooling rather than outright 
&#8220;racism.&#8221; A different but telling complaint comes from Kenneth Olden, 
the first black to run one of the National Institutes of Health. He says
 blacks in general show little interest in science or scientists, and 
&#8220;the community&#8221; seems not to care about his glowing record at Harvard 
and the National Cancer Institute. &#8220;Does it bother me?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;It 
does a lot.&#8221; Indifference began at home; Dr. Olden&rsquo;s father could never 
understand why he wanted to spend so much time studying science.
        </p>
        <p>
          The successful non-whites interviewed for this article do not appear to dwell on &#8220;racism&#8221; but <i>The Scientist</i>
 warns that &#8220;even in the academic world prejudice sneaks out.&#8221; One black
 academic complained that when he was hired for his first job, the 
chairman of the department actually told him it was because they needed a
 minority. Also, a Choctow Indian woman who says her &#8220;native background&#8221;
 is &#8220;a profound influence on my holistic approach to cancer patients&#8221; is
 nevertheless insulted that people have asked her why she doesn&rsquo;t wear 
moccasins or braids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today&rsquo;s success stories complain about how hard it was not 
have role models but also complain about how much work it is for them to
 be role models. &#8220;Fighting stereotypes,&#8221; is also said to be exhausting 
business.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article about the dearth of blacks in the biotech business
 extols the efforts of companies that are trying to change things. Amgen
 Inc., for example, has given $1.5 million to Spellman, the black 
women&rsquo;s college, to set up a center for molecular biology. It grants 
scholarships to Spellman students and offers summer internships. <i>The Scientist</i> is silent about how many black lady researchers Amgen has managed to nurture.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Jensen, who is a recruiter for the biotech industry, is 
perplexed to note that employers who already have minorities don&rsquo;t want 
to give them up: &#8220;I think there are more minorities in academia. I don&rsquo;t
 know why, but when academia lands some sharp students of minority 
descent they glom onto them and really foster their interest in the 
academic research area  &hellip;&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The Scientist</i> managed to find some small companies that
 admit they make no special effort to hire non-whites. &#8220;We&rsquo;re looking 
for the very best scientists for the job without regard to their ethnic 
status,&#8221; says a CEO who manages 24 employees. However, the director of a
 scientific head-hunting firm says that affirmative action inevitably 
comes with size: &#8220;They&rsquo;ll have developed to 80 employees and they&rsquo;ll 
realize &#8220;Hey, we don&rsquo;t have a very diverse work force here,&rsquo; and they&rsquo;ll
 go out and try to correct that.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the big stories in the issue is about &#8220;diversity 
training,&#8221; which is pitched for two main reasons, one moral the other 
economic. Bernard Scales, the black man in charge of &#8220;diversity&#8221; for 
Dupont, says &#8220;it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, in terms of addressing equity,
 fairness  &hellip; and equal opportunity for all of our employees. And right behind that is that it&rsquo;s critical to our business success.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Maurizio Velasquez, founder of Diversity Training Group, 
agrees: &#8220;The more diverse a company is, the more competitive it will be 
in a diverse society.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert Hayles, a black man who runs his own diversity 
consulting business, says the same thing: &#8220;[W]hen there is diversity of 
style, of function, of age, of race, of language or of culture in a 
group contrasted to a group that is more homogeneous   &mdash;   given equal 
management and goals in both groups   &mdash;   the diverse groups quantitatively 
and qualitatively outperform the homogeneous groups.&#8221; <i>The Scientist</i> did not seem to think it necessary to cite Mr. Hayles sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biotech company Genentech has been pushing diversity with 
great enthusiasm. For example, it has an association of black employees 
who put on programs to edify non-blacks. It has a Hispanic association 
and a Filipino association. The co-chairman of the company&rsquo;s homosexual 
association says that such groups are &#8220;mushrooming&#8221; because of 
Genentech&rsquo;s promotion of diversity. This is supposed to be great for 
business.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same issue of <i>The Scientist</i> has two long editorials
 about racial matters. One is a rambling, largely incoherent piece by a 
black cancer specialist at the University of Texas. Two of its less 
opaque sentences are: &#8220;When the staff of a hospital deals with the 
health problems of minority patients without the training, insight, or 
sensitivity needed to approach these individuals, efforts are doomed to 
failure. You might not see this as racism but I do.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          In another editorial, Jordan Cohen makes two points: &#8220;Finding 
solutions to the most recalcitrant health problems, even being able to 
conceptualize what the problems are, will require a research work force 
that is much more diverse racially, ethnically, and by gender than we 
now have.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          How to get that precious diversity? &#8220;[T]here is simply no way 
admissions committees for M.D. and Ph.D. programs can select an 
adequately diverse class of students today without taking race and 
ethnicity   &mdash;   explicitly or implicitly   &mdash;   into account.&#8221; In other words, to
 get the &#8220;diversity&#8221; the country needs, standards for doctors and 
scientists must be selectively lowered, and better-qualified whites kept
 out. Ominously, Mr. Cohen is president of the Association of American 
Medical Colleges.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last article in this special issue is a somewhat sheepish 
account of the &#8220;science&#8221; going on in black universities. After a bit of 
hemming and hawing, the article concedes that &#8220;research output is less 
important than is research for its educational value.&#8221; It goes on to 
conclude that black colleges &#8220;could fill an important niche in 
translational research   &mdash;   that is, research that bridges discoveries from
 the laboratory to the community.&#8221;

          <b>Too white.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This special issue is probably typical of the kind of thing 
scientists read and think they have to believe. Even in the laboratory 
and operating room, there are strong pressures to have the right line up
 of non-whites rather than the most capable people. T<i>he Scientist&rsquo;s </i>cheerful acceptance of this view is almost amusing in light of a claim the paper makes in the masthead of every issue:
        </p>
        <blockquote> &#8220;<i>The Scientist</i> serves its readership in many
 ways, but one of its most valued aspects is its commitment to open 
discussion of controversial topics. While readers praise us for this 
commitment, they should also recognize that all articles  &hellip; reflect the views of their authors and not the official views of the publication  &hellip;&#8221; </blockquote>
        Now, perhaps, we understand. The editors actually know all about
 race and IQ, but promote affirmative action only to be &#8220;controversial.&#8221;

						<p>
							<i>Samuel Francis, American Renaissance, June 1997</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>
          <span class="dropcap">W</span>henever you get into a debate, 
you can almost always tell your opponent is hiding something when he 
starts piling up new arguments for his position in place of the old 
arguments you&rsquo;ve already refuted. In the debate over IQ and race, this 
happens frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          First the argument was that IQ tests were culturally biased. 
But new IQ tests showed that the more you control for cultural bias, the
 larger the IQ differences between the races. Then it was claimed that 
intelligence really can&rsquo;t be tested. But performance on IQ tests matched
 performance in school, academic tests, and professional success. Then 
they said &#8220;intelligence&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t really exist anyway. But intelligence 
is a concept that human societies have always recognized and would find 
it hard to abandon. Finally, the most recent argument has been that 
&#8220;race&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t really exist, that it&rsquo;s only a &#8220;social construct.&#8221; Now 
even that defense of egalitarianism, an increasingly common one, is 
starting to shrivel.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the shriveling isn&rsquo;t happening without a good deal of last-ditch egalitarian resistance. On April 17th, T<i>he Washington Post</i>
 reported in a front page story that archaeologists have now found 
remains of quite a few prehistoric pilgrims to North America whose 
skeletons are   &mdash;   well   &mdash;   &#8220;Caucasoid&#8221; (see AR, January and April, for 
reports on &#8220;Kennewick Man&#8221;). This is a problem for two reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first place, as everyone who has seen the Eisner 
version of &#8220;Pocahontas&#8221; knows, Caucasians were invaders who stole the 
country from the &#8220;First Americans&#8221;   &mdash;   namely the North American Indians, 
who, as <i>Post</i> staff writer Boyce Rensberger put it, &#8220;all resembled
 today&rsquo;s Asiatic peoples, popularly called Mongoloids.&#8221; (Popularly? When
 was the last time you heard someone in a bar referring to Asians or 
Orientals as Mongoloids?) If the &#8220;First Americans&#8221; or &#8220;Native Americans&#8221;
 were really Caucasian, then maybe Mr. Eisner will have to remake his 
movie and a lot of textbooks will have to be rewritten. But more of that
 problem anon.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, how could scientists tell the skeletons were Caucasian rather than Mongoloid? Identification, says the <i>Post</i>
 story, was &#8220;based on a scientific technique called craniofacial 
morphometric analysis. It involves detailed study of the shape of the 
skull and face, using a sophisticated method called multivariate 
analysis. In some cases, more than 60 different dimensions of a skull 
are measured and compared with comparable dimensions considered typical 
of specific racial groups.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          But if race doesn&rsquo;t really exist, if it&rsquo;s just a &#8220;social 
construct,&#8221; how can you identify the race of a skeleton? Mr. Rensberger 
(or his editors at Egalitarian HQ) tried to handle the difficulty 
manfully and sensitively. Here is their solution:
        </p>
        <blockquote> &#8220;Most anthropologists agree that races, as most 
people use the term, are socially defined groupings with no scientific 
definition. No physical traits are exclusively the property of one race 
or another. Still, anthropologists agree that certain combinations of 
measurements, chiefly of the face and skull, can be used to determine 
whether individuals belong to one population [!] or another. This is 
true primarily for groups [!!] that have been separated geographically 
for thousands of years.&#8221; </blockquote>
        <p>
          Now in the first place, the above paragraph has nothing to do 
with the news content of the story. It is inserted purely for 
ideological instruction, to let readers know that the <i>Post</i> has not signed up with the <i>Bell Curve</i> boys who believe that race might really exist after all. Back in the good old days of the Soviet Union, <i>Pravda</i>
 probably had lots of paragraphs just like it. But in the second place, 
whether Mr. Rensberger or his editors realize it or not, they have just 
told their readers that race really does exist. It exists, not as a 
social construct or as &#8220;socially defined,&#8221; but as an objective fact of 
nature.

          <b>Favorite football team: unknown.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Class, for example, is a &#8220;social construct.&#8221; You cannot tell 
someone&rsquo;s class by examining his skeleton. Nor can you tell his 
religion, nationality, regional origin, marital status, or favorite 
football team. But you can identify his race (and sex) because race is 
not &#8220;socially defined&#8221; but, like sex, is defined by nature.

          As J. Philippe Rushton notes in his <i><a href="http://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=1595&amp;category_id=95">Race, Evolution, and Behavior</a>,</i> &#8220;The view that race is only a social construct is contradicted by biological evidence. Along with blood protein and DNA data  &hellip;
 forensic scientists are able to classify skulls by race.&#8221; (p. 235) As 
behavioral geneticist Glayde Whitney wrote in AR (March 1997),
        </p>
        <blockquote> &#8220;it has already become obvious that there are 
substantial genetic differences between the races. It is trivial to 
identify unerringly the race of any individual, including mixes of 
various races. This fact should forever dispel the myth of racial 
equivalence. Fashionable nonsense to the effect that race is a social 
rather than a biological phenomenon is clearly and demonstrably false.&#8221; 
Race, in other words, is a genetic construct, a natural construct, and 
social definitions have nothing to do with it. </blockquote>

          The discovery of the Caucasoid skeletons in North America lets
 a lot of skeletons out of the scientific and journalistic closets, and 
some &#8220;scientists&#8221; whose job it is to guard those closets don&rsquo;t much like
 it. As the <i>Post</i> was careful to point out later in the same 
story, &#8220;Some anthropologists reject the Caucasoid label for the 
prehistoric skeletons.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel Grayson of the University of Washington, for one, says 
that using the word &#8220;Caucasoid&#8221; &#8220;raises &#8216;a red flag, suggesting that 
whites were here earlier and Indians were here later.&rsquo;&#8221; Professor 
Grayson adds that using &#8220;the word,&#8221; as the <i>Post</i> refers to the 
term Caucasoid, &#8220;implies that the ancient peoples who reached the New 
World were like today&rsquo;s Europeans or American whites.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, this is obviously getting out of hand, and it brings us 
to the second problem raised by these ancient skeletons. Somebody might 
say that the Europeans who arrived after 1492 weren&rsquo;t such aggressive 
invaders after all, that they might even have had some right to come 
here since their ancestors were here at least as early as &#8220;First 
Americans.&#8221;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the <i>Post</i> is quick to point out that &#8220;some other 
anthropologists&#8221; (who remain unnamed) note, &#8220;the &#8220;apparently Caucasoid&rsquo; 
skeletons may represent a physical type that was not ancestral to 
today&rsquo;s Europeans  &hellip; In other words, the 
scientists say it is possible that it is only a coincidence that the 
ancient skeletons have features that resemble those of Europeans.&#8221; Well,
 that&rsquo;s much better, because, you see, even though race doesn&rsquo;t really 
exist and is only a social construct, the prehistoric Caucasoids who 
came here were not of the same race as the later Caucasoid invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, the white people who came to this continent 9,000 
years ago didn&rsquo;t establish any political or cultural claim to the 
continent for modern whites, regardless of whether they were &#8220;ancestral&#8221;
 to them. Neither does the presence of Mongoloid ancestors of the modern
 Indians establish any political or cultural claim for their modern 
descendants. The claims of each group are based on what their more 
immediate ancestors contributed to the making of what is today American 
civilization and the American nation, and it ought to be fairly obvious 
that the modern European races (excuse me, I meant &#8220;population groups&#8221;) 
had a bit more to do with that than the Kwakiutls and the Ojibwas.
        </p>
          But another obvious point is that modern racial egalitarians 
can&rsquo;t bear to look at the evidence from comparative anatomy and 
molecular genetics that now prances before their eyes, and they have to 
resort to the most grotesque ideological and linguistic contortions to 
preserve the egalitarian myth that race doesn&rsquo;t exist. Newspapers like 
the <i>Post</i> and some scientists like (apparently) Professor Grayson 
are always happy to enlist themselves in the preservation of such myths,
 to the point that both science and journalism are imperiled. If the 
trend continues we might as well give the country back to the 
Caucasoids.  <img src="../../../../ar/graphics/textend.gif" alt="AR" height="11" width="11"/>

		<p>If you want to ruin a cordial conversation with a typical liberal, mention in passing that you agree with The Bell Curve. If you suggest that rapists are motivated by sexual desire you will get much the same result. <br/>

The dogmas of social liberalism cannot be proven scientifically. Therefore they are defended with invective, and threats to one&rsquo;s career. </p>

		<p>This article is a good reminder that science is not just a pure pursuit of knowledge and facts but rather is often interfered with by politically motivated people in one way or another. Sometimes it&rsquo;s downright dangerous to come up with inconvenient  facts, in authoritarian countries, or otherwise the researchers are hounded and can&rsquo;t make a living, in the countries that call themselves democratic. Research is often tainted by politics, so it&rsquo;s always best to be somewhat skeptical even about the guys in the white lab coats. </p>

The solution is simple. We gives the blacks their own country, or even their own continent. They build a fence to ensure no whites enter and steal any of their inventions. They then become the most advanced society in the worlds history, and whites wither away and die from the lack of black ingenuity. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be though, but I think I can handle it. I believe I deserve to be punished for my inferiority by being isolated from minorities. Working my rump off to pay taxes so they they have an easier life really hasn&rsquo;t taught me anything.</p>

		<p>As a research scientist myself, I am absolutely sickened by the extent to which science has allowed itself to become overrun with liberal fantasies. When objectivity and honesty give way to political goals, a fundamental underpinning of the scientific method is lost. </p>
<p>Even some liberal scientists have protested, as observed in &#8220;the Sokal Affair&#8221; in 1996 (!), where a physics professor intentionally published a scientific paper to show how standards have been lost, that at its core was complete nonsense such as gravity being merely a patricial social construct, that was accepted by peppering the paper with language and ideology of the left. The message was apparently lost on the leftwing ivory towers as things have only continued to deteriorate, over the past decade and a half, not improved.</p>
<p>There is also a problem of liberal suppression of research that is deemed politically-incorrect. As a result, one can see a rise of such &#8220;incorrect&#8221; science in places such as China, which means a loss to the West in the long run.</p>
<p>As far as minorities in science is concerned, the University I work at is gung-ho on bringing&rsquo;em in, standards be damned. When I was an undergrad about 20 years ago (when meritocracy was more prevalent), nearly all the grad students in the department were white or Asian. After getting my graduate degree, a post doc and returning to that same department to work as a research scientist about 5 years ago, there were about as many Hispanics and Blacks in the grad program as whites. Many Hispanics and Blacks got in on taxpayer funded programs specifically designed to give them major helping hands to enter graduate school that were not available to non-NAM students, such as special one-on-one tutoring sessions with professors (in some cases, with professors even going over tests from previous years with them before exams, explaining the answers in detail with them, for questions nearly identical to what they would be seeing that year), professional guidance counseling, their own Ombudsman (no access by non-NAM students), paid scholarships, strong encouragement of professors to write glowing recommendations for them, holding their hands through research, and getting their names onto scientific publications regardless of whether they had pulled their share of the load to justify it.<br/>
These students disproportionately break equipment, loaf, and impose a disproportionate load on the University resources, compared to traditional graduate students. At least there is still a degree of sensibility in professors when they are in the role of gate-keeper for Preliminary exams and PhD defenses, as perhaps only 1/2 to 1/3 of the numbers of these students entering the program compared to traditional students entering the program, ever make it through. That of course represents a major loss to the taxpayer funding it, but may at least represent a necessary obstacle to liberalism that even they cannot over readily overcome, as turning out incompetent PhDs would soon bring down the rankings of the university and reduce its significance and quality of future applicants, as well as reduce the monetary stream of cash from grants, from alumni, etc (probably the major reason in the administrators&rsquo; eyes). </p>
<p>Many whites are deciding it&rsquo;s simply not worth it to enter a life of science. If I had known 20 years ago how it would be when I was still in the early steps of this path, I would have gone into business or engineering.<br/>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve come to think more and more that much of this nation&rsquo;s decline is related to large-scale Affirmative Action employment.  Is this what happened to the quality of cars made in Detroit or to the postal service?  <br/>
And, as for scientific research, how can it operate in a society in which some issues are verboten?  It&rsquo;s akin to scientists trying to investigate the human body in an era in which cadavers could not be dissected.  Worse, we&rsquo;re being subjected to junk science touted as legitimate  &mdash;  such as the preposterous &#8220;gay gene&#8221;.  I once told a liberal friend that the left claims nothing is inborn but sexual orientation.  He had to agree.</p>

		<p>However, the director of a scientific head-hunting firm says that affirmative action inevitably comes with size: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have developed to 80 employees and they&rsquo;ll realize &ldquo;Hey, we don&rsquo;t have a very diverse work force here,&rsquo; and they&rsquo;ll go out and try to correct that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>No, at that point, a gubmint diversity enforcer (usually a huge, angry black woman) will pay a visit to the company and demand to know why there are no minorities working there.</p>

		<p>In Canada the native Indians and Inuit people have a bad time with alcohol. They seem to be highly prone to addiction.  However it is taboo to mention this.  And we are constantly assured by so-called experts that any problem they might have with addiction is caused by colonialism and by their parents and grandparents being in residential schools. These are the only socially acceptable explanations, even though there is not a scrap of evidence for them. </p>
<p>It is much more likely that there is a biological basis to this problem, and that the Indians have a genetic tendency towards addiction.  If this were studied extensively it might lead to breakthroughs in treatment that would be very beneficial to the Indians and Inuit.   But no scientist would dare to study such a thing because they would be vilified as a racist Nazi.  It is really a sad situation.  </p>
<p>Some aboriginal tribes in Canada have a very high rate of diabetes, and it is socially allowable to study the genetics of this problem and to talk about it in a rational way, but no one dares to mention &#8220;alcoholism&#8221; and &#8220;race&#8221; in the same sentence. </p>
<p>Political correctness does a lot of damage science.</p>

		<p>it has been decades since it became clear that Europeans settled the Americas before Asians.</p>
<p>the fact that most white Americans don&rsquo;t know it yet means we have an unparalleled propaganda system.</p>
<p>meanwhile, an open recognition of racial difference would allow us to dismantle an entire universe of counterproductive and expensive programs.</p>
<p>yet most whites would continue to stumble long, repeating the same mistakes.</p>
