			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ted Nugent, Washington Times, March 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Europeans are finally awakening from their self-imposed Rumpelstiltskin deep slumber to discover that multiculturalism is actually cultural rot and is ripping their countries apart.</p>
<p>From the United Kingdom to France to Spain to Germany, leaders or former leaders have decried multiculturalism as a poisonous experiment for their nations.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s next  &mdash;  is Europe going to rediscover that the Earth is not flat?</p>
<p>You have to wonder how these leaders ever could have signed on to encouraging Muslims to lead separate lives and not to assimilate in the first place. Pardon me, but even a venison-fueled guitar slayer knows that playing politically correct games always leads to death, destruction and decay.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Instead of condemning Muslim extremists, Europe instead condemned a Danish cartoonist who poked fun at Muhammad  &mdash;  free speech be damned. The German Government censured an author for writing a popular book that claimed Muslim immigrants were lowering the intelligence of Germany. Not to be outdone by the Europeans, the American media implied that those Americans who protested the proposed placement of a mosque in downtown Manhattan were bigoted and anti-Muslim.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While Europe was imploding because of political correctness and doing its best to accommodate Muslims praying in the street and whatnot, many Muslims were  &mdash;  and still are  &mdash;  working hard to impose their religious/political customs, traditions and values on those European nations and right here in America.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Europe really wants to get tough, its nations should outlaw Shariah law and all of its machinations. Public funds should be cut off immediately to Muslim groups that refuse to condemn Muslim extremism. Public officials and others should condemn Muslims who preach separatism. Those Muslim imams who preach jihad or hatred should be jailed or expelled and their mosques closed. Tougher immigration rules should be passed and enforced.</p>
<p>Muslims should be free to practice their faith but not free to impose it on others. Democracy doesn&rsquo;t work that way. When in England, act like the English. That&rsquo;s the respectful thing to do. Embrace it or leave.</p>

<p>No, Ted, if Europe really wanted to get tough, they&rsquo;d toss their Mohammedan populations out altogether, and send them back to their natural environment.  But Europeans  &mdash;  and amerikans  &mdash;  are as terrified of being called &#8220;Racists&#8221; as Nugent is of being called an animal lover.<br/>

As much as I appreciate Mr. Nugent&rsquo;s sentiments, I do wish someone would have edited his work.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Rumpelstiltskin deep slumber&#8221;?</i> I believe he meant Rip Van Winkle. </p>
<p><i>&#8220;What&rsquo;s next  &mdash;  is Europe going to rediscover that the Earth is not flat?&#8221;</i> I find this to be a clumsy and forced reference. </p>

<p>This is a strong end. The only thing I would add is that Muslims should be free to practice their faith &#8220;in Muslim nations&#8221;. There is no reason for a Muslim to be in a non-Muslim nation.<br/>

		<p>Ted has the right idea, but still falls short of what it will take for Europeans and Americans to be successful in the centuries old, religo-cultural war with the Islamists.  Islam needs to be outlawed in the West, with the penalty for practice being prison and expulsion.  Anything short of that, and we set ourselves up for slavery or extermination.  His last statement, &#8220;Embrace it or leave.&#8221;, also falls short of what is needed, for if seventy million Chinese embraced &#8220;Britishness&#8221;, but race-replaced all Britons, the ethnic British still end up as being an exterminated group. </p>

		<p> A small correction first, Mr. Nugent: Rumpelstiltskin didn&rsquo;t sleep for 100 years; the Sleeping Beauty did   &mdash;   wrong fairy tale.</p>
<p> Having said that, I must continue that I pretty much agree with everything you said about the impending doom of the Europe from whence both our ancestors came   &mdash;   unless the powers that be are willing to swallow their ideological prejudices and agree with these courageous leaders that, yes, multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work and is in fact extremely destructive to European civilization.</p>
<p> The liberals will have to admit they&rsquo;ve been wrong, and join in efforts to stop the rot and reverse the Muslim takeover of the continent. The European people in general will have to start having babies again   &mdash;   fertility rates of 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 children per woman of child-bearing age are slow racial suicide.</p>
<p> Think either of those things will happen? Don&rsquo;t bet the rent on it. We Whites have been brainwashed to view ourselves as the evil conquerers, the bigots, the &#8220;Nazis.&#8221; There are too many Whites in positions of authority and influence who, deep down, hate their own race, and want to see it die out. And too many White European couples see families of three, or four, or more children, as &#8220;too expensive&#8221; or &#8220;too much trouble.&#8221; We are the victims of our own success, both in Europe, and in America.</p>

		<p>For everyone here that says the Nuge is a genius&hellip;the Nuge is a visionary&hellip;the Nuge for President, he&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>I have met him and my brother used to work with his son.  Ted Nugent is no genius.  He is an average American and has common sense.  </p>
<p>That is better than some genius saying it.  The common man voices his opinion and people can disagree, but they cannot argue he is wrong.  The average man needs to voice his opinion in a public, non-comment section on an internet news site, venue.  Ted has, have you?</p>
<p>And for the record I would vote for him for President.</p>

		<p>Getting closer, but still not quite there.  He hasn&rsquo;t yet grasped the essential point, or at least he doesn&rsquo;t say it.  We don&rsquo;t need to watch out for and punish &#8220;extremist&#8221; imams in our own countries, and we don&rsquo;t need to outlaw shariah law.  What we MUST do is simply say no non-europeans in european countries.  Period.</p>

		<p>Attention, all Amreners;  Here is a man who was/is a Rock and Roll legend, once belonged to a band called the Amboy Dukes that had a hit called, &#8220;Journey to the Center of the Mind.&#8221;  He has become well known for his advocacy of Second Amendment Rights, hunting, and conservative politics.  I haven&rsquo;t heard him speak about religious affiliation.  So for those of you who think all Baby Boomers who dappled in the Counter Culture and changed, (bringing some useful insights with them) don&rsquo;t belong, consider the power that this well known NRA spokesman has with so many whites that have been and will be brought into greater consciousness as whites.</p>

		<p>Well, that WAS true   &mdash;   but all of a sudden the Europeans are waking up with regard to the truth about Islam.  Now that their countries are being taken over by radical Muslims, all of a sudden they&rsquo;re reversing their former tolerant ways.  Well, better late than never, I say.  Next they&rsquo;re going to have to come up with a viable plan to get the wretched Muslims OUT of their respective countries, and take back their own lands and populations.  The German minister is right   &mdash;   Islam DOES NOT belong anywhere in Europe, North America, or Australia.  We need to get rid of it toot sweet, before we all pay the ultimate price.</p>

		<p>It would be nice if some of this suddenly popular contempt for multiculturalism were applied toward anyone other than Muslims, and primarily in Europe/Canada, etc. It isn&rsquo;t just Muslims at issue here - it is ALL non-whites, and most specifically, those from Africa, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, The Middle East, etc! </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s somehow only okay to take a stance against multiculturalism by bemoaning disaffected and dangerous Muslims. That just scratches the surface of the REAL problem of the multicult fantasy!!<br/>

		<p>It&rsquo;s the wrong message.  Look at someone from the Middle East and decide whether having their genes in your pool would be a good idea (average IQ in Islamist states = low 80s).  Now realize that with the IQ comes the look.  And decide how much you want a dusky skin and dark eyes with heavy features as the attraction factor of your children&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s marital limitations.</p>
<p>If you won&rsquo;t grab hold and uplift that reality, you have only invited Goths across the Danube where, just like the Goths, the Arabs/Mestizos/Asians/Blacks will settle, breed themselves out of their habitat&rsquo;s ability to support them, _do nothing_ and then ask you why you have so much.</p>
<p>This is the outcome of 50,000+ year of genetics as survival strategy derived from living in a hellishly hostile environment, desperatey poor in resources and having no hope of improvement.  These cultures have subducted themselves to a socialized meme of endless &#8216;patience&rsquo; between outbursts of selective, exploitive, violence.</p>
<p>This NOT &#8216;fresh blood&rsquo; for our genelines.  Our genes are fine.  There&rsquo;s are damaged by inbreeding, rape and do-nothingism.</p>
<p>We need to return to being Europeans and let the world have their own &#8216;no Westerners/Whites allowed&rsquo; homelands.  As they have always done.  We will continue to improve because we manage our resources better.  They will either continue to watch from the sidelines and fall ever further back, evolutionarily.  Or mimic us and start to improve themselves.</p>

		<p>The cultural elites are blinded by their memes, narratives, amorphous definitions, and overgerneralizations substituting for logic. Islam should be outlawed in the West precisely because it is NOT a religion, instead it is a totalitarian political ideology, wrapped around of core of backwards 7th century Arabist culture with trappings of religion thrown into the mix. </p>
<p>&#8220;Are you now, or have you ever been a member of, the Communist Party?&#8221;  Do you realize this question is still (and rightly so) asked of potential immigrants trying to get anything other than a tourist visa?  Islam should also be part of that question. Who knows, such an approach might even make so-called moderate Muslims wake up and start a true reformation.  </p>

		<p>Cultural assimilation leads to genetic assimilation leads to white extinction. <br/>
Genetic assimilation was the goal from the beginning, multiculturalism was something they knew wouldn&rsquo;t work, it was just the preliminary step toward their ultimate goal of white extinction. Ted Nugent is saying what they want people to believe so they let him write an article for a big time news paper. Do you think they would let Jared Taylor write an article saying what he thinks for this same news paper? No way.</p>

Wage Jihad for Allah..and those who die in the cause<br/>

		<p>Europe will have to bring down an iron curtain against immigration ( from any source) and begin the long process of unwinding herself of the immigrant colonies. Repatriation. There are no half baked measures against this demographic disaster.<br/>
In France an alliance has been formed between Jewish groups and the immigrants frorm Islam to present a united front against the usual &#8221; ism&rsquo;s&#8221; - racism-xenophobia-islamophobia,antisemitism&#8221;,and anything else the mind conjures up in the fight against the European originals. Europe is occupied at present, militarily, culturally subdued and subjugated to a tyranical subculture devoid of Europeanism . The struggle for a new Reconquista will be long, very long and very hard. </p>

		<p>Faced with the issue of a troublesome immigrant minority, a society at the minimum must do one thing. They must absolutely stop all new immigration frrom the original country or countries. Only this will force the existing immigrants to assimilate over time. Worked in the United States.</p>
<p>Please make note, this is a minimum response. A more effective response would be to induce immigrants to leave. This could be done through forced selective expatriation. This would be resisted, of course. Another possible thing that could be done is to indemnify those who agree leave voluntarily and even those who are forcibly expatriated. Many legal and illegal immigrants have paid into public and private pension systems in Western countries. They could be given both an immediate payment and a reduced lifetime pension immediately in exchange for leaving. That could be a very attractive option to some people. Would also reduce the resistance of those who were involuntarily expelled. </p>
