			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Susan McCord, Augusta Chronicle, March 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 16th birthday party for one of James Brown&rsquo;s grandchildren ended tragically Saturday in the shooting death of an employee of the Columbia County facility where the party was held.</p>
<p>James S. Gillette Jr., 19, of Kensington Drive in Augusta, was pronounced dead at 12:45 a.m. at Medical College of Georgia Hospital, where he was taken after being shot at Belair Conference Center, Columbia County Chief Deputy Coroner Bonnie Holloway said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The shooting took place after fighting broke out, Morris said. About 200 to 300 people were in attendance, and there was no known security, he said.</p>
<p>Patrons had been asked to leave because of the fighting but were being allowed back inside when shots were fired, Morris said. One of them hit Gillette, who collapsed just outside the building&rsquo;s front door, he said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Deanna Brown, a daughter of the soul singer, confirmed Sunday that the party was being held for her niece. Brown said she did not attend the event and had no other information.</p>
<p>After the shooting, several people were seen leaving in two vehicles, both of which were riding on at least one &#8220;donut&#8221; spare tire, Morris said. Authorities have a partial ID on one of the suspects, a black male known as &#8220;DQ,&#8221; but had made no arrests as of 9 p.m. Sunday.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll bet $10.00 to anyone who reads this article that this will come out to be the &#8220;true&#8221; cause of this misunderstanding. When the real truth is an adult with the intellegence of a 8 year old felt slighted in some way and had to defend his street cred.</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder why they refer to their houses as &#8220;cribs&#8221;?</p>

		<p>This kind of thing is common.  The granddaughter of Bernard Parks, former Chief of the Los Angeles police department and presently a city councilman was murdered in a driveby shooting when he was Chief.  She was with her fiance a known gangster with a criminal record.</p>
<p>The children of Congressman and and oakland Mayor Ron Dellums were also gangsters.  His teenage daughter became a common San Pablo av street prostitute.  His son was jailed many times, while Dellums served in congress and dated White women.</p>
<p>At less exhalted levels, such as the average workplace one finds that the black employees are constantly dealing with their criminal relatives and friends as well as having criminal records themselves.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll say it again.  NOBODY minds 200-300 blacks gathering together in public or hotel venues, nor objects and cancels the event due to threat of violence - AND IT ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN BLACKS ARE INVOLVED.  But let a bunch of whites in suits and ties schedule an AmRen event, and suddenly the event always gets cancelled due to threats of violence.  When will Whites come together as a race and say ENOUGH.</p>

		<p>I attended many, many birthday parties for friends and classmates growing up.  Once a little girl dumped a Sprite on another girl, but that was the worst &#8220;violence&#8221; to ever break out.  A shooting would have been unimaginable&hellip;I guess our birthday parties lacked vibrant diversity!  </p>

		<p>Sorry to say this, but as soon as I saw the word &#8220;worker,&#8221; I concluded the victim was not black.  Sure enough, he was a young white man.  Interesting that with fighting going on - among the guests, I assume - a white kid working at the facility, and not participating, was gunned down.  Of course, a racial motive will NOT be looked at.</p>

Why do blacks bring knives and guns to parities, clubs, concerts, backyard barbeques, family reunions, etc.?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never felt unsafe attending any majority white event, public or private.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s a Georgia thing? This happens at least 5-6 times a year in the Atlanta area, and always with the same factors involved: First, a &#8216;sweet 16&rsquo; party. As an aside, show me a 16 year old black female that is &#8216;sweet&rsquo;. Heck, they&rsquo;d just as soon whip your backside while they cuss you out. But I digress. Then, 100 or more &#8216;uninvited&rsquo; black thugs and hoes er, youths, show up. There are no parents, er, adults in attendance.  A fight, er, misunderstanding, breaks out. There is a shooting or two or twenty. No one, amazingly, can ID the shooter - not ONE of the 100 or more uninvited black thugs and hoes, er, youths saw who done it. Then, after police are called and one or more of the black thugs or hoes, er, youths is shot and/or killed, the concerned parents (term used loosely) who hear about the melee rush to the site, wailing and screaming to police and reporters about dey baby done been shot or, conversely, &#8216;my baby ain&rsquo;t done dun NUTTIN! Where was da PO-leese?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so familiar, one could act out this play without rehearsing.</p>

<p>Obviously they go armed to protect themselves from the other blacks attending the event. It isn&rsquo;t as if they have to worry about whites attacking them anymore, the last of the real K are in their graves or in their 80s. </p>
<p>On another note yesterday a black ex-convict murdered an Athens Georgia police officer who was responding to a carjacking and wounded another officer.</p>

<p>The day before a black man sexually assaulted a young white college girl in broad daylight in the parking lot of an apartment complex near the University of Georgia.  He was attempting to drag her off and rape her when a bystander challenged him and chased him off.</p>

<p>I am white and I almost always exercise my right to concealed carry, especially when I know that I will be entering areas of enlightening diversity.</p>

		<p>America first raises a good point:</p>
<p>How are white service workers to avoid such situations without losing their jobs?</p>
<p>A waiter who refuses to serve an all-black party would certainly be fired.</p>
<p>If he accepts, he may be caught in the crossfire.</p>

		<p>Until about 10 years ago there was an annual black event in Los Angeles.  All the black sorities, fraternities and other clubs  in Los Angeles area colleges had a big picnic and dance in May, usually in a public park.  Every year someone was killed and others wounded.  Every year the blacks vowed that it would never happen again, they would behave themselves.</p>
<p>They finally stopped having these events after they killed another victim in Balboa Park.  If the park district had refused to let them have the parties because of the murders there would have lawsuits and cries of racism.</p>
<p>And these are the future affirmative action black leaders.</p>

		<p>I am a 45 year-old white man politely described by the FBI as being an &#8220;ex-felon, ex-mercenary, firearms expert, explosives expert and on the terrorist watch list, and I haven&rsquo;t seen any of this stuff at parties I have visited.</p>
<p>I like pot-luck parties with only a little alcohol, good food, and we play rummy.  I&rsquo;m no good at bridge, but I am a devastating rummy player.</p>
<p>Curiously, there&rsquo;s no violence at these functions.</p>

		<p>To Anonymous at ##12 and 13:</p>
<p>Yes, I did conclude that he was white, but then I researched the victim on the internet.  Many articles, including obituaries,  with his picture exist.  He certainly is white, lived with his parents.</p>
<p>Another potential good, productive citizen wiped off the face of the earth - still in his teens - by street thugs, who will not only never contribute, but only destroy.</p>
<p>I weep for my country.</p>
