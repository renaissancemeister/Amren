<h1><a href="http://www.blackamericaweb.com/?q=articles/news/moving_america_news/26458">Analyst Kevin Weekes Helps Change Face of Hockey</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Frederick Cosby, BlackAmericaWeb.com, March 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t believe that the face of professional ice hockey is rapidly changing should take a look at Kevin Weekes.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive season, Weekes can be seen on &#8220;Hockey Night in Canada,&#8221; the first national black hockey analyst in the history of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&rsquo;s prestigious ratings juggernaut, up north&rsquo;s equivalent to the United States&rsquo; &#8220;Monday Night Football.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m something that &#8216;Hockey Night in Canada&rsquo; viewers hadn&rsquo;t seen before,&#8221; Weekes told McClatchy Newspapers. &#8220;For some people, it has taken some time getting used to it. I know that from certain comments from the odd person. But the vast majority of people have been excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>[Weeks has] become such a hockey fixture that he&rsquo;ll be in Washington this week to participate in the third annual Congressional Hockey Challenge, a game between hockey-playing members of the House of Representatives and Senate versus lobbyists; to stop by the White House to witness President Barack Obama congratulate the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks {snip}.</p>
<p>Weekes will coach one of the teams in the Congressional Hockey Challenge. The proceeds from the event go to Washington&rsquo;s Fort Dupont Ice Arena, one of the few ice skating rinks in America located in a predominantly black neighborhood, and to the Fort Dupont Ice Hockey Club, the nation&rsquo;s oldest minority youth hockey program. Its founder, Neal Henderson, was profiled last month during NBC&rsquo;s coverage of &#8220;Hockey Day Across America.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weekes&rsquo; presence on the air has been a game-changer in terms of attracting more black fans to hockey and showing black youths that hockey isn&rsquo;t just an all-white sport. Willie O&rsquo;Ree, who became the NHL&rsquo;s first black player when he joined the Boston Bruins in 1958, said black kids can see someone who looks like them involved in a non-traditional game and see the possibilities for them in the sport.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} It used to be that black people didn&rsquo;t want to hear anything about hockey, dismissing it as a white man&rsquo;s game. Weekes recalls the days he was barely able to strike up a hockey conversation when he visited his black barbershop in hockey-crazed Toronto. {snip}</p>
<p><br>
{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;My concern with hockey in general,&#8221; Moore [former CBC president Scott Moore] told Sports Illustrated in 2009, &#8220;is we tend to skew old, and we tend not to speak to diverse communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weekes&rsquo; arrival in the broadcast booth coincides with growth in the number of black players in the NHL. There are more than 20 black players currently on NHL rosters, an all-time high. Four of them  &mdash;  all-star defenseman and Minnesotan Dustin Byfuglien, Canadian-born forwards Evander Kane and Anthony Stewart and Swedish defenseman Johnny Oduya  &mdash;  play for the Atlanta Thrashers.</p>

		<p>Yeah I bet that strategy works.  They can&rsquo;t even get more whites to watch hockey for goodness sakes.</p>

		<p>I know the real reason behind the push to get more blacks into traditional white activities  &mdash;  it&rsquo;s to push whites out. But there&rsquo;s an unspoken implication in all of this that is really not very complimentary to black people: it&rsquo;s that white activities are so much better and more interesting than black ones. You don&rsquo;t hear much about a push, for example, to get more whites involved in singing traditional African chants.</p>

		<p>Well here goes another sport Down The Tubes.<br>
I for one don&rsquo;t care what blacks can do, I want to see what other people like me (white) can do.<br>
But then again IF I said that I am sure I would be called a racist? And in America you can&rsquo;t be any worse than a racist, no matter how many facts back up your opinion.</p>

		<p>One of the reasons blacks aren&rsquo;t good at winter sports like ice skating and skiing is because they are generally more top-heavy than whites.  Being real tall doesn&rsquo;t help either.  The ongoing efforts to bring blacks into Winter Sports and other non-optimal black performance sports continues to be comical.  They think that anything that isn&rsquo;t black dominated must be because of racism, and one fluke athlete is held up to represent black supremacy and white inferiority.  Still, we continue to hear about the problem of supremacist whites.</p>
<p>In society Affirmative Action has been functioning for 40 years like a bully who bars white men from entrance because they are white men.  It has become plain that their failures are not due to white privilege or even racism.  They are their own worst enemy.  All the current Amren columns demonstrate this, yet we keep being held accountable for it.</p>

		<p>I wonder how this will affect the brawls so common in hockey?</p>
<p>Does this mean that we will see black NASCAR drivers soon?</p>
<p>I just love those matter-of-fact statements about the players, especially the Swedish black one.</p>

		<p>To be fair to Weekes, he is not an affirmative action hire. Maybe he&rsquo;s overexposed because he&rsquo;s black, but he is more coherent and crisp than most of the NHL Network&rsquo;s analysts. He was a career back up who showed brief flashes of brilliance when he played but has shown to be a very good analyst. Truth be told, if all blacks were like him there&rsquo;d be little racial strife anywhere. He&rsquo;s a very amicable fellow. Sadly that isn&rsquo;t the case.</p>
<p>I have to chuckle at the NHL trying to get more diverse. It&rsquo;s way too expensive to appeal to any significant non white minority other than Asians. It can&rsquo;t be played on a street (without a little bit of a production and even then, a ball on the street is not the same as a puck on the ice,) or a dirt lot. It is wholly the product of the cold, which for most states and even parts of Canada requires highly expensive refrigerated surfaces. Additionally the black advantage in hockey is lessened as compared to football or basketball. Propulsion is wholly dependent on the quadriceps and mobility the hips and groin. While the higher percentage of fast twitch muscles fibers always helps, jumping is not a prerequisite. Higher placed calf muscles are meaningless.</p>

		<p>This is the result of black people looking at the overwhelming white population of hockey and saying &#8220;that&rsquo;s racist&#8221; until white people cave in and push them in the sport.  Anything considered white makes black people green with envy and becomes a target for them to Africanize.  They can&rsquo;t be white so they must co-op, takeover or destroy what is &#8220;white.&#8221;  The same thing is happening with skateboarding and motorcycle racing.</p>

		<p>Right, more NASCAR driver, more chess players, more pro golfers, more pro tennis players, more Olympic swimmers and divers, more Olympic gymnasts, men and women, more, more, more, more, etc.</p>
<p>Then the whole world will be right and everyone will be able to sit next to his fig tree and just watch the world go by.</p>

		<p>Like there isn&rsquo;t enough violence and unsportsmanlike conduct in hockey already?  On and off the ice?  Gimme a break.  What possible good could getting blacks attending do?  They already riot at basketball games, awards ceremonies, hip hop bars, after football games, at fast food restaurants, and anywhere else they gather.  What a bright idea - blacks at hockey games.  </p>

		<p>Blacks in hockey is already a real problem and the NHL spends more time and money marketing to them than it does trying to fix the concussion problem. What is great about hockey now is that nearly every player is extremely articulate, polite, and educated. Of course there are a few boneheads out there but nothing like any other major team sport. The majority of the black players now in the league are actually very educated and articulate as well. However, there a few  &mdash;  and they are the ones most hyped up by the media  &mdash;  who are nothing but trashy punks (Joel Ward in Nashville, P.K. Subban in Montreal, Chris Stewart now in St. Louis). My home team recently acquired one of the twenty blacks and he has already broken several of hockey&rsquo;s unwritten codes of conduct (which most media outlets and readers of this forum do not understand) and pissed off a lot of season ticket holders like myself. If he stays around I will not be renewing my tickets for next season.</p>
