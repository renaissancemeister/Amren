			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nelson Pressley, Washington Post, March 19, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A few days before opening in &#8220;Sabrina Fair&#8221; at Ford&rsquo;s Theatre last fall, Susan Heyward found herself bawling in front of the cast.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I didn&rsquo;t understand why I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying,&#8221; Heyward says in an interview from New York. Heyward was playing the lead  &mdash;  the Audrey Hepburn part, if you think of the movie &#8220;Sabrina&#8221;  &mdash;  in Samuel A. Taylor&rsquo;s 1953 Cinderella romance. Chauffeur&rsquo;s Daughter Captures Heart of Rich Employer&rsquo;s Son, goes the story, only Ford&rsquo;s made the play about race by isolating Sabrina and her father as black figures in an affluent white milieu.</p>
<p>The script itself remained unchanged. But even though the characters did not mention the new theme, it was blatant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurt so much to be in a world where something so elemental to your being was ignored,&#8221; Heyward says, explaining her sudden eruption. &#8220;I had to acknowledge that for Sabrina.&#8221;</p>
<p>There may be power yet, then, in an idea that last seemed vanguard a couple of decades ago: nontraditional casting. Latinos, blacks and whites in Arena Stage&rsquo;s &#8220;Oklahoma!&#8221; last fall, and now an African American version of Horton Foote&rsquo;s 1953 &#8220;The Trip to Bountiful&#8221; at Bethesda&rsquo;s Round House Theatre. The concepts don&rsquo;t necessarily seem fresher than Arena&rsquo;s &#8220;Pygmalion&#8221; with an African American Eliza Doolittle 20 years ago or an all-black &#8220;Waiting for Godot&#8221; on Broadway in 1957.</p>
<p>But Timothy Douglas, director of &#8220;The Trip to Bountiful&#8221; (best known as the 1985 film that won Geraldine Page the Academy Award for Best Actress), suggests that nontraditional casting is enjoying a renaissance. The flurry on Broadway in recent seasons has included Morgan Freeman in Clifford Odets&rsquo;s &#8220;The Country Girl,&#8221; S. Epatha Merkerson in &#8220;Come Back, Little Sheba&#8221; and an all-black &#8220;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&#8221;  &mdash;  all 1950s plays, curiously, like &#8220;Bountiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The gambit is never wholly free from controversy, though. &#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; suggests actor Howard Overshown, who plays the son of the aging woman who longs to return home in &#8220;Bountiful,&#8221; &#8220;I feel nontraditional casting is in lieu of doing black plays.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the theater world still has to contend with the long shadow of August Wilson&rsquo;s 1996 speech railing against colorblind casting as a form of &#8220;assimilation&#8221; (his word) to be resisted. When Arena convened a national panel of black playwrights last winter, Wilson&rsquo;s speech was handed out as the starting point for the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an assault on our presence,&#8221; Wilson thundered, complaining of a theoretical all-black &#8220;Death of a Salesman,&#8221; &#8220;an insult to our intelligence&#8221; and &#8220;our playwrights.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We do not need colorblind casting; we need some theaters to develop our playwrights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edward Albee, who has long been outspoken about sticking to the playwright&rsquo;s intentions, issued a general caution on nontraditional casting as the current festival of his works was being put together at Arena. When Ford&rsquo;s director, Paul Tetrault, told the &#8220;Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&#8221; author about his concept for &#8220;Sabrina Fair,&#8221; Albee replied, &#8220;Do you think that black people and white people are completely interchangeable?&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;That had not come into my consciousness,&#8221; Douglas says in response to the assertion that doing a &#8220;white&#8221; play with black actors often takes one of the limited programming slots that might have gone to a black playwright. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Race frequently stands for little in contemporary productions of European classics; just check your most recent Shakespearean playbill, no matter where you&rsquo;ve been. &#8220;Colorblind&#8221; is the term for casting in those cases, and Tetrault uses it to explain the policy of his theater&rsquo;s annual production of &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221;: &#8220;We&rsquo;ll cast anyone in any role,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Lizan Mitchell, who is playing the homesick Carrie Watts in &#8220;Bountiful&#8221; at Round House, has appeared in Greek tragedies in which race was immaterial. It&rsquo;s the American plays that up the ante, she says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Thus black dramatists have been known to hold up a hand and say: Hey, if you want to send a less ambiguous message, we have a couple of scripts you could look at. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Still, Wilson&rsquo;s complaint about white-run theaters picking the plays and seldom drawing deeply from the black repertoire remains a problem. Smith and Tetrault are comfortable pointing to their companies&rsquo; track records producing black writers, but Mitchell  &mdash;  who says she often participates in readings of promising new plays that never get produced, to say nothing of the rarely touched canon of African American works  &mdash;  is troubled.</p>

		<p>  The reason that the theaters do not pick Black plays is that the Black community does not like to pay for plays, they want free admission.<br>
  Many Black plays have folded in towns and cities, even in the deep south&rsquo;sargest cities,with a majority Black population. Usually it is from lack of a paying audience.</p>

		<p>If blacks want &#8216;black theatre&rsquo; then maybe they should write some plays themselves, set up and run some theatres themselves, get the audiences themselves and stage the productions themselves.  Exactly as the &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites have done.</p>
<p>Or maybe they could just whine a lot and complain that &#8216;racist&rsquo; whites aren&rsquo;t doing it all for them.</p>

		<p>In 1969 I worked on a college play about ancient Greece.  The director cast an unknown black professional actor from LA to play the lead, the historical figure Alcibiades.  We thought it a bit odd at the time.  Three years later, Paul Winfield won the Best Actor Academy Award for &#8220;Sounder.&#8221;</p>

<i>&#8220;Indeed, the theater world still has to contend with the long shadow of August Wilson&rsquo;s 1996 speech railing against colorblind casting as a form of &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; (his word) to be resisted.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Even with the large numbers of blacks in the world, only a small percentage of them have any artistic sensibilities to create great art. Hence, they have to expropriate the works of whites.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how blacks have claimed Disney&rsquo;s &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; as somehow black and African. I guess any veneer of blackness is passable as black. </p>
<p>As I always say, if blacks don&rsquo;t like the jobs in entertainment, let them write, produce, act, and direct their own black movies and theater. The fact is THEY CAN&rsquo;T and there&rsquo;s no market for their work, even among blacks.</p>
<p>All black &#8216;art&rsquo; is political theater on race. They are truly &#8216;Johnny One Notes&rsquo;. Constantly have the oh-so-important them of race jammed down your throat during a night of escapist entertainment is not something most white people want to put themselves through.</p>

		<p>Plays like The Trip to Bountiful could credibly be done with an all-black cast (though a few whites would make it more believable).  The characters are struggling country folk and the few people whom they encounter.  The problem comes when European aristocrats are portrayed by blacks or when some white antebellum belle has a non-controversy-causing black boyfriend.  <br>
This whole race-blind casting scheme is a plot of the left to desensitize viewers and attempt to put non-whites on par with whites.  And the blindness goes only one way.  Shaka Zulu would never be portrayed by a white.  <br>
If race doesn&rsquo;t matter, then why should beauty, age, or even gender?  </p>

		<p>I love live theater but as most tickets these days run in the $100+ range, I will make a point of checking out the casts and or any other changes made to make traditional American theatre more multi-cultural and PC.</p>
<p>I would certainly never attend anything written by mulatto playwright Augustus Wilson who insisted that ONLY black directors manage his racist, anti-white works.</p>
<p>I suggest every white do the same.</p>
<p>Hit &#8216;em in the pocketbook and boycott these monstrosities!  Money is the ONLY thing the PC idiots, those who wish to destroy white civilization, respect and understand.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fall for any attempts to change our books, literature, plays and works of art, to claim they&rsquo;re &#8220;racist&#8221; or &#8220;don&rsquo;t reflect reality.&#8221;  </p>

		<p>Casting blacks in white roles, hoping to draw a greater black audience?  Great plan.<br>
Blacks don&rsquo;t know how to behave in theaters.  Cell phones, yakking, shouting at the screen, cursing with foul mouths, etc.  And theaters wonder why they are losing money and going bankrupt?  A lot depends on white folks donating to art and theater.<br>
Blacks don&rsquo;t donate squat to any charity, and they don&rsquo;t like to pay for theater tickets.<br>
If they do pay for tickets, they then think they and they alone own the theater and behave in-theater like they do on the street - loud, uncouth, hooligans often impulsively going violent.</p>

		<p>In the late &#8216;80&rsquo;s, I drove truck for a company that supplied transportation for Broadway plays, rock shows and other entertainment.  For one run, I was assigned to a black road show that happened to be in Atlanta.  I was prepared to load up the sets, and go on my way.  One problem.  The company didn&rsquo;t pay their trucking bill.  So, while I did load it, I was stuck there for 3 days while everyone argued back and forth about the bill.  Eventually I was told to just bring the stuff back to NJ and park the trailor at the yard. This cost lots of bucks.   Blacks just don&rsquo;t care for that kind of entertainment.  Needless to say, the company never signed on with a black troupe again.</p>

		<p>One play that I WOULD like to see done with partial black cast is &#8220;A Streetcar Named Desire.&#8221;  This may seem perverse and indulgent in the same way as films like &#8220;Jungle Fever,&#8221; at first glance.  But I think that this was the real intention of Tennessee Williams, and the taboo against the full expression of his intended meaning was too strong even for Williams to write.  </p>
<p>This play/film is about a former slave holding Southern aristocratic families demise in its final chapters.  Driven to the edge of banality by the abuses of Reconstruction, the last two Belles, sole heirs and remainders of the family are subducted into a seedy, undignified end. One  is little more than a sex-slave to a brute, and her sister (ironically played by Vivian Leigh), finally driven insane by the loss of any respectful social status, clinging to false memories until she is raped by her sister&rsquo;s brutal husband and then committed to an insane asylum where who knows what kind of abuses (common to the day) awaited her.  Imagine how electrifyingly polarizing the story would be if handsome white heart-throb Marlon Brando had been replaced by a black actor.  I&rsquo;d really like to have seen Sidney Poitier reveal himself fully in that sort of role.  As it is, the message of the play is a bit too muddled for today&rsquo;s white audiences, who need a real slap in the face like that.  Such scenes have been played out in reality in endless regularity since the 1960s.</p>

		<p>I remember attending a performance of Othello in the Cleveland OH area about 50 years ago. Othello was played by a black, and several black patrons sat prominently in the first row.</p>
<p>However, Othello was a Moor, a North African, not a sub-Saharan. I now wonder when that got changed.</p>
<p>BTW, we live in an African nation, as you can tell when you go to the grocery store and look at the pictures of the babies on the boxes of diapers.</p>

		<p>&#8220;We do not need colorblind casting; we need some theaters to develop our playwrights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- Whites didn&rsquo;t need non-whites to &#8216;develop&rsquo; them.  They did it themselves.  Read the words of poster #3:</p>
<p> &#8220;&hellip;blacks want &lsquo;black theatre&rsquo; then maybe they should write some plays themselves, set up and run some theatres themselves, get the audiences themselves and stage the productions themselves. Exactly as the &lsquo;racist&rsquo; whites have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the problem with most minorities.  They want to piggy back on our achievements without all the sacrifice and hard work.</p>

		<p>I myself have been forced to attend black plays in high school that were written and directed by blacks. They always came across as whiney melodramas about how whites drove blacks into poverty,homosexuality and criminal behavoir. The only black actor without a attitude that I have seen in film would be the black old man in song of the south. That&rsquo;s a little sad isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

		<p>I saw the 25th anniversary of Les Miz. It had a black cast as one of the key characters. It REALLY bothered me. I thought it was just ridiculous to cast a black for that part. He was a gifted singer, but it simply wasn&rsquo;t credible to cast a black for the role and it spoiled it for me. In any case in all the years I have gone to the theatre I can count the number of black patrons I have seen on the fingers of my hands. Blacks are simply not patrons of the arts. Indeed one reason I enjoy the theatre is because of the almost total absence of blacks - no loud talking, cellphone yakking etc. I basically stopped going to see movies because of them.</p>
