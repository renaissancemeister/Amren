			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corky Siemaszko, Daily News (New York), March 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Tanzanian woman was kept as a &#8220;slave&#8221; by a British widow for nearly four years during which she was fed just two slices of bread a day  &mdash;  and made to sleep on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Mwanahamisi Mruke was forced to work around the clock by a cruel mistress who hid her passport, ordered her about by ringing a bell  &mdash;  and didn&rsquo;t give her a single day off during her servitude, British papers reported Thursday.</p>
<p>The harsh details of Mruke&rsquo;s imprisonment came out during a trial that ended with the conviction of Saeeda Khan on a human trafficking charge  &mdash;  reportedly the first case of its kind in an English court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>{snip} Rivlin [Judge Geoffrey Rivlin] sentenced Khan to nine months in prison and about $60,000 in fines and court costs.</p>

		<p>So she gets fined. Does her slave get paid?</p>
<p>I remember when we covered Nordic law in 5th grade (a 2-room school house). There was so much paid for the loss of an eye, an arm (right arms were worth more), or a life (if the survivors missed the deceased  &mdash;  good reason to be nice to your relatives). And it all went to the victim or the victim&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>It seemed so primitive&hellip;and so just.</p>

		<p>I wish I remembered the details. Quite a few years ago, a German TV station brought a documentary on this very subject. This woman is not an exception, slavery is flourishing, especially among well to do Moslems.  Bring ignorant girls in from  black Africa, promise them jobs, before they know it, they are slaves. What can a girl from a backwards nation in that situation do if nobody helps her?  </p>

		<p>Right. An Englishwoman doing wrong. An Englishwoman? NO! The mentality, the very essence of the woman is not that of an Englishwoman.</p>
<p>Statistically, if the keep such statistics, this WILL be counted as an Englishwoman practicing slavery, forced involuntary servitude. A big negative for the &#8220;English&#8221;.</p>
<p>Same thing here in thge U.S. Every now and then you have a news story of some American holding other persons as slaves. That &#8220;American&#8221; is almost without or even without exception a dark skinned person with $50,000 cash in their pocket at the time of arrest.</p>
<p>But counted as an American.</p>

		<p>Having noticed articles about modern day slavery in Western countries I have discerned a theme that runs through them. The owners are always mean and insensitive. They do not feed their slaves well, or clothe them properly. They do not know when to rest their slaves or pet their slaves for being good slaves. Instead they get their kicks by stomping on those who serve them.</p>

		<p>A televison programme in South Africa, made by a South African compnay and aired after Apartheid was finished, proved beyond dount with interviews that black servants preferred by far to work for white employers.  They all said without any hesitation that black employers wanted them to work 24/7 and paid very little.  The white employers paid well, with a pension plan usually and ended up treating them like members of the families.  And that was my experiences there in 24 years.  But at least the black people have their freedom now.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m fairly convinced that the future of Britain will be a war between blacks and subcon Indians, in fact rather like the Africa Dr. Khan fled from.<br>
 White will have disappeared by that time.</p>

		<p>Slavery became a criminal offence in Britain on 6th April, 2010. The slave trade was ended in 1807. In 1834 it was illegal to keep a slave anywhere in the British Empire. However, it was not until 2010 when it was made illegal to own a slave in Britain as stated in Section 71 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. It was never criminalised before hand because it was not recognised as a state of being. There were other laws against kidnapping, abduction, false imprisonment, sexual trafficking, and other things associated with slavery, but it was not illegal for one person to own another. There are an estimated 27 million slaves in the world, which is more than there were when slavery was not illegal. So why the delay by the UK until 6th April 2010? It only came about as more and more domestic &#8216;slaves&rsquo; were discovered in London households of West African blacks and Middle Eastern arabs, especially those with diplomatic immunity as these families were quite used to having slaves in their home country and so saw nothing wrong with continuing the practice. Most of these households were extremely rich and none were White English. None of the &#8216;slaves&rsquo; were White or &#8216;bought&rsquo; in UK but shipped in as domestic help or extended family members. Of course, black africans in africa have owned slaves for thousands of years but blacks in UK and USA simply refuse to acknowledge this and prefer to blame Whites for the entire international slave trade. Black slaves are still being discovered in UK black households and this report from only a few days ago is the most recent to be prosecuted.</p>

		<p>Take a look at that photo of Saeeda Khan.<br>
She was a medical doctor in Britain&rsquo;s NHS.<br>
 That is the face of the highest echelons of British society.<br>
 - And you thought that English doctors were all clipped accented David Niven lookalikes?</p>

<p>Stay in Africa where she belongs! Then send all the Muslims back where they came from. </p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t you read about all the poor White women from Russia, and from other European nations, being promised &#8220;secretarial jobs&#8221; etc. only to end up at the hands of these vile prostitution ring cartels making them slaves with no one to turn to&hellip;we all know that White women are more prized as prostitutes than nonwhite women are, but you will never hear about it from our media. </p>

		<p>I read somewhere that only one American of native birth has ever been charged with slavery and she turned out to later be a psychopathic murderer. Most of the time the perpetrator is some middle easterner or African who claims they didn&rsquo;t know it was against the law! Yeah right! One Saudi national went as far as to say it was insulting to her Islamic culture to tell her she could not keep slaves. The answer to that would be to return to Saudi Arabia where that is tolerated. There are more slaves now than at any other time in history but Southern Whites have to constantly flagellate themselves for having slaves 150 years ago but Muslims arabs- who legally abolished slavery only in 1962- and whose government turns a blind eye to continued bondage of household help- get a free pass.</p>

		<p>We have seen a few cases in the U.S. of East Indians and Arabs doing this to whites.  I have personal experience of one such case.  Au Pair workers (women who come to another (Western Country) as a nanny/housemaid for wealthy people)have allowed many young European women to travel the world and get into many difficult situations.  I met one through a friend, who had a German friend, who knew this young German au pair.  I was set up on a date with her.  Once in her company, she told me how she was being abused by an Arab family she was working for, principally the wife.  This was in Northern California in 1994.  I didn&rsquo;t know how to help her.  I just encouraged her to get away from them.  I later worked in Eastern Europe recruited for my professional work having found the job through my Alma Mata.  Once there, I found myself in an abusive situation.  I found a way out and had a better experience afterward.  Traveling for work and experience is both dangerous and experientially profitable.  But it is full of pitfalls, especially if you are female.</p>

		<p>This is a third world thing that cuts across cultures and religions, mostly in Africa, Asia, India and the middle east, though also in Haiti.  </p>
<p>I have persanally witnessed many times people from such backgrounds talking down to others they deem lesser than them.  When I say talking down, I mean outright mean and domineering.  </p>
<p>Slavery was never abolished in Western Africa, yet we whites are blamed for the sins of just a fraction of our ancestors.  Even more stupifying - 95% of all Africans kidnapped from Africa and brought to the New World were sent to Caribbean, Brazil and Latin America!  But it&rsquo;s only white america that is associated with historical slavery, even though the portuguese and spanish were the most guilty by far.  They get a free pass.</p>

<p>That statistic is pretty much correct. I have seen stats saying about 30 million black African were taken out of Africa and about 600,000 were sent to British North America, which became the U.S. And those slaves sent to Latin America, Brazil, etc., for the most part WERE WORKED TO DEATH AND THEN JUST REPLACED! A population of replicating slaves as you had in the U.S. just never existed in most other parts of the western hemisphere.</p>
