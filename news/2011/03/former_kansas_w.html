<h1>Former Kansas Welfare Worker Says Illegal Immigrants Abused the System</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Steve Kraske, Kansas City Star, March 10, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A hearing on an Arizona-style immigration law drew impassioned testimony Thursday, including a statement from a former welfare worker who described &#8220;overwhelming&#8221; levels of fraud by illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Lana Reed, who worked as a bilingual specialist for the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services in Overland Park from 2008 to 2010, urged lawmakers to adopt the bill targeting illegal immigration. She described a system overrun by illegal immigrants who used false Social Security numbers and other fraudulent documents to game the system.</p>
<p>&#8220;I witnessed overwhelming levels of fraud and corruption resulting in the waste of millions of taxpayer dollars,&#8221; Reed told the House Judiciary Committee. &#8220;Most of the fraud was conducted pursuant to policies of the SRS, which required employees to turn a blind eye to fraud and abuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill would require police to check the legal status of those they suspect might be in the U.S. illegally. It would require state and local governments and their contractors to run citizenship checks on new hires and require proof of citizenship for anyone seeking public aid. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a standing-room-only statehouse hearing room, opponents argued that the measure would stretch already overworked police departments, prove costly to businesses and pose an administrative nightmare for workers who provide health services.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Kobach [Kris Kobach, secretary of State] insisted the measure would save the state millions in welfare benefits that no longer would be paid to illegal immigrants. He said the four states surrounding Kansas, including Missouri, have adopted &#8220;E-verify&#8221; programs for their own hiring.</p>
<p>Tom Stoffers of Tonganoxie said the state was being &#8220;bled dry&#8221; by illegal immigrants who use social services.</p>

		<p>I had a job in the field so I saw it first hand. Illegals work for cash so they can claim to have no income or a very low one, you have to take their word for it. Although they can&rsquo;t get welfare directly they can get Food Stamps (now called LINK and SNAP) and Medicaid for their anchor children and you know they always have a lot of them. Of course it goes into their hands as they are the adults. If pregnant or having a medical crisis the illegal can get Medicaid also. They always conveniently report the father as being out of the country. Throw in the cost for children&rsquo;s public schooling, school meals, emergency room visits, all other societal services (and they use it to the hilt), and it adds up. Social service agencies have hired many Spanish speaking workers just to take care of the illegals. Also, Chicago, like many other cities, is a &#8220;sanctuary&#8221; city so illegals have no fear in applying for aid; they&rsquo;re quite brazen about it. </p>

		<p>This whole scam sickens and angers me. They do the same thing here in Utah but take it one more level. Being that the LDS church will give assistance to its loyal (tithe paying) members they also get church assistance which ALSO includes food, rent, medical and other assistance. Medicaid also is a huge racket- I have insurance but still have to pay big bills since we have not met our deductable for the calendar year. When our baby is born in June we will still be out around 2,000 dollars- even with insurance! </p>

		<p>Here in Queens I swear it looks like every immigrant has a medicaid/food stamp card.  And the number of elderly immigrants who are getting everything including SSI, is unbelievable.  Why do we import the world&rsquo;s poor, elderly and sick?  I&rsquo;m tired of being at the local hospital and seeing just about everyone a foreigner and so many with children and pregnant too.  Free carfare, no co-pays, they can get medications that the rest of us can&rsquo;t.  Many times I am the only white American in the office.  I went to the dermatologist at a private practice and I WAS the only white American there.  A couple of years ago I had to go to the emergency room and there were many foreigners who didn&rsquo;t look to be sick or in pain to me.  Watching tv, drinking sodas, talking on cell phones.  Why are they allowed to use our emergency rooms for non-emergencies.  My sister had to beg for them to take me for my REAL emergency.  I&rsquo;m disgusted.  Then there&rsquo;s all of the foreigners in public housing here, with their free electricity.  </p>

		<p>&#8220;Kansas is being &ldquo;bled dry&rdquo; by illegals on welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>BUT!  Take consolation in the fact that the entire state of Kansas is on the verge of imploding due to an inability to meet its budget obligation, and they&rsquo;re going to be faced with the prospect of massive public employee layoffs, including firemen and police, while they are going to have to seek a reduction in the public pension fund which has only about 1/3 of the money to meet pension obligations.</p>
<p>The situation is at a point where it is either cutback or collapse!  They&rsquo;re in worse shape than Wisconsin.</p>
<p>As with most of the other states, Kansas could very likely be on the way out financially.  2012 will prove to be a disasterous year for the entire USA.  (And Europe.)  </p>
<p>Will the American Empire, as all others before it, finally gulp its last dying breath by 2015?  Some say yes and offer credible, valid reasons for their projection.</p>

		<p>I knew a woman who worked in this type of job in Oregon.  She told the same kind of story.  She said she was provided obviously false documents and the like.  She pointed this out to her superiors and was told in no uncertain terms that she was not working in law-enforcement and given direct orders to ignore the ongoing fraud OR ELSE!</p>

<p>Guess who is the Kansas Governor who now has this budget headache (largely caused by Kansas&rsquo;s significant and ever increasing Hispanic population)   &mdash;   I&rsquo;ll give you a hint:  We called him Samnesty Brownback while he was in the Senate, because he was right there on the &#8220;comprehensive reform&#8221; bandwagon right behind Juan McAmnesty and Lindsey Grahamnesty.</p>

		<p>I cannot begin the imagine the level of fraud, corruption and theft going on in my state of Caliofnria at the various social service agencies. This is especially true since many of those working at the social service agencies are spanish speaking  anchor babies, with a sympathetic disposition towards their la raza. Heaven knows there is not an illegal invader in this state going without. </p>

		<p>As a Kansan, I voted for Brownback full aware of his attitude toward illegals.  However, he could never pass amnesty in the state because conservative representatives would tear him a new one.</p>
<p>To 4:</p>
<p>Kansas is not in as dire straits as Wisconsin.  The state will have an easier time cutting spending because:<br>
a) it has a solid Republican base<br>
b) no union history<br>
c) a conservative citizenry</p>
<p>As a Kansan, I feel confident Kobach will continue pushing for tougher immigration standards and that Brownback will be outnumbered on this issue.  However, Brownback is fiscally conservative, so on that issue he should be a benefit toward common-sense white Kansans, who make up 85% of the great state.</p>

<p>I experience the same thing EVERYWHERE I go now.  When I see another white person, I pause and marvel for a moment.  As I walk the streets and pass building after building, I imagine how 50 years before, everyone there was white, and now, you will be hard pressed to see a white face more than once in half a day.</p>
<p>Imagine 50 years from now!  Whites on this continent will exist in the hinterlands of a fragmented landscape of independent nations, latino empires, african kingdoms.  I just wish I wouldn&rsquo;t be so old then!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because SSI is the new AFDC.  After Clinton signed &#8220;Welfare Reform,&#8221; SSI was the fastest growing Federal budget line item between that time and 9/11.  And now it&rsquo;s growing quickly again.  I am of the opinion that, other than the political triangulation, Clinton only signed welfare reform, which time-limited AFDC, because he knew SSI would be there to &#8220;save the day.&#8221;</p>

Go to any landlord/tenant court and you will see hispanics not paying rent, trashing apartments and getting Legal Aid lawyers against the landlord.

		<p>Whites need to form their own government, and no longer recognize our current government. Democracy does not work in the current situation. We cannot recognize a government of non-whites and white liberals who want to destroy us. It would be similar to Jews wanting to live and thrive in nazi Germany. It&rsquo;s a paradox, an oxymoron. We have to form our own government to survive and fight back.</p>

		<p>Mexico is a very corrupt country.  When people from Mexico and other corrupt countries move to the US, they bring their corruption with them.   Widespread corruption turns a country into a dysfunctional hell hole. </p>
<p>It is mainly non-white countries that are riddled with corruption (though some white countries, such as Italy, Greece and Russia, are also very corrupt).  Because of the racial angle, it is not polite to talk about it or to acknowledge that immigrants (legal or illegal) from corrupt countries tend to bring corruption with them.  </p>

		<p>Has America slipped into MADNESS?</p>
<p>These people don&rsquo;t come and take anything WE serve it up to them on silver platters then cry about it. whose fault is it theirs or ours? </p>
<p>I was reading about the tradgedy in Japan.<br>
Are you readers aware of the FACT there is No Looting going on?<br>
No Looting WHY the answer is right before your eyes see it, it is as clear as black and white.</p>
<p>Anytime I hear a black start talking of REPARATIONS and ask Just One Question and then as they stumble around trying to come up with an answer, I walk away.<br>
My Question Is: What were the names of your Slave Ancestors, the ones you can&rsquo;t stop hurting for?</p>
<p>Has there ever been another country where the MAJORITY gave away all their rights to anyone who was not a part of that majority.<br>
When we are no longer the majority in the USA, then that is when the fun will really start and it will be Too Late for us to do a thing about it.</p>

		<p>Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, who represents a distinctly Christian strain of pro-amensty anti-Americanism, is now governor.  As a U.S. senator, he was instrumental in blocking patriotic immigration reform at every turn.  I would say that this is a case of poetic justice, except that it&rsquo;s the people of Kansas (even those stupid enough to vote for him) who have to pay the bills.  </p>

		<p>Yes, SSI is the new welfare.  Elderly immigrants and disabled immigrants get it.  That we allow tax eaters in is unbelievable.  With welfare supposedly time-limited (even though I don&rsquo;t believe it) the social service agencies encouraged their &#8220;clients&#8221; to apply for SSI.  Then mothers go running down to the SSI office to have their kids put on.  Children who are really disabled (like being blind, cerebral palsy, downs, etc.) maybe.  But kids who aren&rsquo;t brought up right and can&rsquo;t behave should get SSI?  But they do.  Troublemakers get SSI in schools all over the country.  In some communities more than others, know what I mean? </p>
