<h1><a href="http://news.msu.edu/story/9018/">Racial Identity Tied to Happiness, Study Finds</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MSU News, March 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Black people who identify more strongly with their racial identity are generally happier, according to a study led by psychology researchers at Michigan State University.</p>
<p>The study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, appears in the current issue of Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, a research journal published by the American Psychological Association.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first empirical study we know of that shows a relationship between racial identity and happiness,&#8221; said Stevie C.Y. Yap, doctoral candidate in psychology at MSU and lead researcher on the project.</p>
<p>Previous research has found a relationship between racial identity and favorable outcomes such as self-esteem, Yap said, but none has made the link with happiness.</p>
<p>For the study, the researchers surveyed black adults in Michigan. The results suggest the more the participants identified with being black  &mdash;  or the more being black was an important part of who they are  &mdash;  the more happy they were with life as a whole, Yap said.</p>
<p>The study also explored the reasons behind the connection. Yap said it may be fueled by a sense of belongingness  &mdash;  that is, blacks with a strong sense of racial identity may feel more connected to their racial group, which in turn makes them happy.</p>
<p>This sense of belongingness is especially important for happiness in women, Yap said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For men, the potential factors relating identity to happiness is still an open question,&#8221; he said.</p>

		<p>I am happier when I identify with being white, when I am around other whites where I feel I belong and not around blacks.  But the government keeps shoving blacks on me in every aspect of my life and tells me I&rsquo;m bad to like being white and being around whites only.  Why is that?  Why can&rsquo;t we whites have racial pride and ties too?  What is everyone so afraid of if we do?  And it is fear.  When whites band together NO ONE can stand against us.  THAT&hellip; is what they fear.</p>

		<p>THe lesson that white people are taught is the exact opposite.  White people who feel guilty and  except the evil history of their race are good white people.<br>
Schools, tv, movies and of course NPR &amp; PBS all carry this message.</p>
<p>To feel bad about about your race makes you a good white person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Favorable outcomes&#8221; is vague. What outcomes are we talking about and how are they favorable?</p>
<p>Creating false high self-esteem doesn&rsquo;t significantly raise academic performance. Is a &#8216;favorable outcome&rsquo; simply being personally satisfied with failure?</p>

		<p>So should it be mandatory for all races to pair off and learn about cultural identity they can be proud of?  Something like health class or sex-ed that is required.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;For (WHITE) men, the potential factors relating identity to happiness is still an open question,&rdquo; he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>My humble theory is that this is what people have religion for.  The problem is that Christianity doesn&rsquo;t really support whites as a race, and men as men. Christianity tells us to be sheep and follow along, rendering all to Caesar and fearing this jealous, but apparently uninvolved God.</p>
<p>We whites have competed against one another for hundreds of years as individuals.  Now we are at a distinct disadvantage.  That is why we need to begin to accept whatever religious view a white may have as long as it does not run counter to white survival interests.  Asatru is best, folks.</p>
<p>I am realist enough to know that all the conservative Christians race realists aren&rsquo;t going to change.  I also understand the potential of the form for community organizing.  If there is going to be any chance, we must be more tolerant toward one another, seeing our desire to see the survival of the white race as the more important common factor.</p>

		<p>Would-be-Doctor Yap should test if happiness among blacks is related to any other delusional mental states besides raging racial pride. Might make for interesting reading if he can manage to safeguard his research from censure and publish his findings without censorship.</p>

		<p>Well, if they&rsquo;re happier if black-identified, then maybe segregation was right in the first place   &mdash;   blacks could identify with blacks all the time and be super HAPPY!!!

Blacks can bitch and whine all they want but in the end they prefer to be with blacks as we know since they all congregate and do act and think the same way on everything without exception. This proves there another devious factor as we also know involved in this social engineering meandering jive and of course we know who and what it is brainwashing mindwashing and trying to screw up the natural order of the races. <br>

		<p>What psychological claptrap!  As usual, the purveyors of such bunk are telling us, in a muddled fashion, things that humans have known since we first walked the earth.  <br>
The fact is, however, that leftists do not want black and brown people to accept themselves for who they are.  By trying to dissolve all differences in a big melting pot, they essentially are pushing them to act white and aspire to the exact same things that most whites do.  The same goes for males and females in regard to gender differences.<br>
People cannot have self-esteem, which I think is essential for happiness, when they are told that they can be anything they want, regardless of IQ.  Thus, a black man cannot simply be the best janitor in the building, but must aspire to a doctorate.  If he can&rsquo;t even read, it&rsquo;s either his own lack of ambition or the fault of the white teacher and her white-culture books and white instruction.  Thus, this man will probably feel guilty about his own drive and/or resentful of society.  </p>

		<p>Could this be genetic? The degree that people identify as black is probably determined by how much black genes they have. And black people are genetically predisposed to higher self esteem.</p>
<p>In any case, I don&rsquo;t think they have cause and effect around the right way.</p>

<p>You are correct that science is the greatest proof there is&hellip; <i>for whites.</i></p>
<p>Lefties are impervious to facts and rational insight.  Those are tenants of evil Western Civilization, the very thing the lefties are trying to rid the world of.  </p>
<p>Lefties prefer Marxist sloganeering, repeating LIES which they foist off as  TRUTH and then defending the LIES by Any Means Necessary threatening and smearing anyone who questions these LIES:  All whites are evil and guilty and must cede their homelands and treasure to nonwhites.</p>
<p>For repeating real FACTS using reason and logic you WILL be called a racist.</p>

<p>This is not true.  Blacks and Browns are 100% encouraged to honor and celebrate themselves and their culture, and NOT act white.  They are encouraged NOT to assimilate but to hold themselves separate with their own languages (Ebonics for blacks Spanglish for Browns).  If this keeps them uneducated and stupid so much the better for their masters because they will be better drones of the state, more open to marxist slogans and following the command to kill whites when the time comes&hellip;and it is coming. </p>

		<p>Racial cohesion for whites is not only healthy but fundamental to human nature.</p>
<p>Nature designed whites to survive together as one race.</p>
<p>The nature of the white race is to keep building and reaching new heights of knowlege and intellect.</p>
<p>To keep improving our quality of life to eventually guide the non-white world in making moral decisions that benefit the quality of life on earth.</p>
<p>But we have been sabotaging ourselves both racially and morally since the fall of Sumer.</p>
<p>Today millions of white Americans continue to be afraid of one another because we continue to sabotage our own principles of faith and trust between each individual.</p>
<p>Just look at the Appalachian people as a stark example.</p>
<p>Only until we accept, acknowledge, and make holy our rights under the Constitution and actually put them into practice will whites conclude this struggle out of ourselves to obtain the health, wealth, and wisdom, that is our right.</p>

		<p>Why does the Government shove blacks down our throats? Because if Whites ever woke up, they would realize that unrest means that power can be seized.<br>
Further, Whites have let themselves be convinced that it is racist merely to object to dispossession, much less to work for their own interests. Never before has a people been fooled into thinking that there is virtue or nobility in surrendering its heritage, and giving away to others its place in history; only whites have been tricked into thinking that love for their own people is somehow &ldquo;hatred&rdquo; of others.</p>

		<p>Self Esteem as rampant self confidence is a function of serum testosterone levels, same as any other steroid.  In blacks, with a 20% higher level than whites (and near 30% over Asians), it grants a sense of superiority by nature rather than achievement &#8216;as a state of being&rsquo; which is confirmable only in it&rsquo;s violent expression of dominance.</p>
<p>i.e.  They are so inferior in so many other areas that they find clinging to that hormone induced sense of native male euphoria a kind of ego reinforcement in spite of the facts.</p>
<p>At least until the edge bursts like too much caffeine and something bad &#8216;just happens&rsquo;.</p>
<p>OTOH, Racial Harmony as a sense of &#8216;belonging&rsquo; is a function of oxytocin production which is a visual driven mental relaxant/social binding mechanism that presumably offsets this dangerous edge, like using Lithium to cut Prozac.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that blacks have a native social culture however asa the only time I have ever seen them in groups where a fight -didn&rsquo;t- break out, for next to no reason, at a given numbered threshold, was when they were surrounded by whites.</p>
<p>The gender differentiation in happiness is a different, evolutationary, social psychology.  In females, &#8216;belonging&rsquo; is a certainty of group entitlement for which sexual submission or omega support roles grant access.</p>
<p>For males, being free of potential social baggage (women, kids, responsibilities) equates with potential empowerment as a means to attract -new- mates and build new inter-male bondgroups (men like being with men because there is zero expectation of resource access as dependent behaviors and thus sharing can be truly beneficial to the individuals) to improve their own position in the social hierarchy.</p>

		<p>I have noticed that progressive whites are happiest living in communities that are mostly white with a sprinkling of Asian/Indian professionals (so they can say their town has &#8220;people of color&#8221;), and as few blacks and Hispanics as possible. </p>
<p>a successful, well-adjusted, beige African-American family is icing on the cake.</p>
<p>but what makes them happiest of all is wringing their hands hypocritical over the utterly horrible whiteness of their small, expensive, white town while enjoying its clean, safe streets and civilized, friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>secretly, of course, they are congratulating themselves over being wealthy enough to live in one of the rapidly shrinking all white enclaves - which doesn&rsquo;t stop them from voting for politicians who promise to flood the country with nonwhites.</p>
<p>white folks sho is crazy!</p>
