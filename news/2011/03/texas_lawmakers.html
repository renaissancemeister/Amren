			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jam Donaldson, Black Voices, March 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Republican legislators in the Texas House have once again proved they are the bastion of backward thinking by voting 101-48 late Wednesday for a bill requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls.</p>
<p>Republicans have long-sought to enact this legislation, saying that their constituents had demanded this change to ensure election integrity. Republican governor Rick Perry declared the bill one of several emergency items on the agenda.</p>
<p>Democrats in the House voted unanimously against the bill, saying the measure would disenfranchise poor and minority voters and is targeting a problem  &mdash;  in-person voter fraud  &mdash;  that doesn&rsquo;t even exist.</p>
<p>{snip} The reality is that in-person voter fraud has never been a problem in this country. In fact, between 2002 and 2005, when hundreds of millions of people voted, the Justice Department charged a whopping 95 people with election fraud.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, said the bill would effectively return Texas to the days of Jim Crow:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s horrible,&#8221; Veasey said. &#8220;I think it discriminates against people. I think we&rsquo;ll look back in shame.&#8221;</p>
<p>One may think that such laws are innocuous. What&rsquo;s the big deal about requiring ID to be shown at the polls? Well, on the surface, nothing; however, voter ID laws disproportionately impact minority, student and immigrant voters and reduce overall voter registration and turnout among those groups.</p>
<p>The elderly, who are the least likely to have a driver&rsquo;s license or find their birth certificate, would have to pay a fee to order a birth certificate and then go down to city hall to apply for an ID card and pose for a picture.</p>
<p>Many low-income citizens who do not have a government-issued ID or have different addresses from their ID card will have to re-apply in order to vote. I feel bad for the granddad who moved to Texas to retire but still has his New York ID and won&rsquo;t be able to vote until he gets a new ID card.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The legislation also impacts college students by requiring a photo ID issued by the government. That excludes students from using student IDs and voting from their campus unless they choose to vote by absentee ballot.</p>
<p>Republicans are quick to point to the ACORN voting-registration scandal as evidence that voter fraud is a pervasive problem. Voter registration fraud, though, which usually consists of registering lots of people who don&rsquo;t exist for money, generally, does not result in in-person voting fraud and, thus, does not have any impact on the outcome of elections.</p>

		<p>Does Jam Donaldson, who wrote this article, honestly believe that Republican politicians meet in secret hide-outs and conspire about taking away rights from blacks and Hispanics? No doubt the writer is imagining what he would want to do to whites if blacks were the majority in Texas and thinking incorrectly that Republicans think the same as he does. You only have to look at Zimbabwe to see that this is true.</p>

		<p>How strange it is that the very people who are so upset that a driver&rsquo;s license or birth certificate might be required in order to vote are not at all upset about black thugs dressed in fatigues and holding weapons while  standing in front of voting locations.  But then in some cases authentic birth certificates might be harder to get than the average American citizen would expect. </p>

		<p>I considered posting a scorching comment on the black web site, but after reading some of their posts it&rsquo;s pretty evident to me that it would be a total waste of time.  Those people are not bright enough to think in objective terms.  That&rsquo;s why they make perfect dupes for so much propaganda and hateful brainwashing.</p>
<p>Probably the greatest threat to their status and opportunities in this country is the increasing numbers of mestizos yet they can&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>And their leaders are not much more aware.  They are given a script to follow by the left, telling them what is good and not good for blacks and they blindly follow it.</p>
<p>I get the impression that these same blacks have some idea that watering down the white population is more iumportant than protecting their numbers, jobs and benefits by disallowing illegals entry or the right to vote.  </p>
<p>They&rsquo;re in for a surprise when the country is so tribalized blacks will be cast aside as useful idiots by white radical leftists who want an open borders policy in order to prevent the country from having one dominant race in control.  That&rsquo;s their way of assuring nationalism will not take hold.  It&rsquo;s nonsense, of course, and the resulting conflict and chaos will be far worse for them than nationalism, which isn&rsquo;t going to happen anyway no matter if they were able to manipulate things or not.</p>
<p>In the end it will again be blacks who wind up at the bottom of the totum pole, and, if whites are edged out BEFORE conflict ensues blacks will be fighting much more viciously with everybody else but whites&hellip;..and most especially mestizos.</p>
<p>And I have no doubt they still will be unable to understand that they were played for fools.</p>

		<p>Liberals never want their constituency to be responsible adults for anything. Getting an ID or getting a simple change of address when you move are fundamental things that adults should be capable of. Instead of encouraging repsonsible behavior they scream &#8220;victim&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyone can go into their neighbor&rsquo;s mailbox and take out the voter booklet and show up at the polls and vote in lieu of the legitimate person it was addressed to.</p>
<p>Next time they ask me for ID when I use my credit card at Walmart I am going to fall on the floor and yell &#8220;Racist&#8221;, tell them how disenfranchised I feel and then sue them! Oops, I forgot I&rsquo;m not a priviledged minority.</p>

		<p> My resident state of Indiana has required government-issued  photo ID to be presented by voters at the polls for years. It&rsquo;s no big deal; a driver&rsquo;s license is normally presented by most people, but if you don&rsquo;t drive, you can get an Indiana non-driver&rsquo;s ID card at the license branch. And, get this, all you liberals sobbing over the &#8220;plight&#8221; of whoever: If you tell the license branch workers that you&rsquo;re getting the ID card so you can vote, THEY CAN&rsquo;T CHARGE YOU A RED CENT FOR PROVIDING IT TO YOU! So much for the &#8220;disparate impact on the poor and minorities&#8221; blather.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;ve worked the polls for my party (Democratic) for years, and let me tell you that the ID card requirement is a good one. It makes the chances for voter fraud (which does exist, don&rsquo;t think it doesn&rsquo;t) much smaller; and it keeps everyone a little more honest. Besides, why should voting be as easy as rolling off a log? I think it means more to people if they have to exert themselves, at least a little, to meet the requirements.</p>

		<p>If you get a chance to travel in Central America, you find that the populations basically acknowledge and accept race realism.</p>
<p>By contrast in the US, Black and Hispanic populations have been intentionally conditioned by the Grievance Industry to be offended by minor events like this. As a consequence of this conditioning, when the welfare state fails and real pain is imposed on those who have become addicted to it, these people will go bonkers.</p>
<p>I suspect that the international finance gang&rsquo;s plan is to then turn the media on these populations, and try to make them the scapegoat. It might work.</p>

<p>Okay Jam.  Then please explain to us what GOOD it would do to falsely register the dead and fictitious names for voting, and NOT have live people show up claiming to be those dead and fictitious people.  I understand that blacks have trouble thinking linearly like that, so you missed the obvious.  However, Whites CAN think analytically, and we DO see the obvious omission you tried to pull on us there.  </p>

		<p>Do those who are so upset think that the people who don&rsquo;t have a license or any type of ID will vote anyway? This is ridiculous,<br>

		<p>We seem to have pretty good finger-print technology nowadays.  Why couldn&rsquo;t we use such technology in our voting process?  With the computing power we have, I am convinced we could come up with a secure and nearly foolproof system which people may actually come to have confidence in.</p>

		<p>You mean to tell me there are all these people that just walk around with no identification?  No driver license?  No Social Security card?  No welfare ID even?  That is nonsense.  The only reason that blacks and hispanics are upset by this legislation is it will somewhat impair their ability to vote several times per election.  There is no reason to be against voter fraud unless you are committing it. </p>

		<p>Does anyone besides me remember the law that required the establishment of a Federal ID that was supposed to go into effect in 2008? The card would have been required to vote, board an airplane, sign up for the dole and to enter sensitive government facilities.</p>
<p>I suspect that implementation of the law never got funded after the Pelosi gang took over the house.</p>
<p>If the Federal ID law had been in place during the 2008 election we might have a different progressive in the White House.</p>

		<p>So opposition to voter fraud is reinstating &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221;.  That makes &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; look pretty sensible.  Heck, I think they should go back to having a literacy requirement.  It is typical of the left to think that you can have a successful democracy when people incapable of reading are voting.  Just how informed on the issues are illiterate people likely to be?<br>

		<p>Check out the Texas Department of Public Safety web site.  The fee for getting a non-driver photo-ID is only 15$.  That for an actual driver&rsquo;s license is just 16$.  The idea that paying for for a state issued photo ID is a hardship is simply absurd.</p>

		<p>It really cracks me up when liberals complain thanthe poor or minorities will be &#8220;disproportionately effected&#8221;. Obviously if they are here legally and eligible to vote they would have some sort of state issued ID. I think it is a law in all 50 states that a person must posses a state issued ID after about 30 days after taking up residence. A person whose permanent residence is in New York should not be voting in Texas so that arguement does not hold water. I&rsquo;m sure a &#8220;low income&#8221; person could take 15-25 dollars out of the beer, cigarette and cable TV budget to pay for an ID card if he or she doesn&rsquo;t have one. </p>

		<p>of course we need voter ID&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;<br>
and we need to vet our politicians!!</p>
<p>I have done a lot of research on this subject. For starters, Obama&rsquo;s maternal g&rsquo;mother stated to a reporter that she had been present at his birth in Mombasa. Immediately the Kenyan govt. sealed all Obama family records and passed a law making it against the law to interview members of the Obama family. When Obama was elected Senator, the most influential newspaper in Kenya ran the headlines: &#8220;Kenyan-born Obama elected to U.S. Senate.&#8221; He traveled to Pakistan in 1981 when Pakistan was off-limits to Americans. What passport did he use? British or Indonesian? He refuses to publish his college transcripts from Occidental, Columbia and Harvard. Is it because he was attending school as a foreign student? And, why has he spend over $2 million to keep from producing a birth certificate that would cost at most $25.00? And, Michelle once stated that they had visited Obama&rsquo;s home country. And, even if his mother is a U S citizen, if he was born in Kenya, she should have registered him with INS once they moved to Hawaii. She was such a scatter-brain that I doubt she ever did this, therefore he must be an illegal alien. My two sons were born out of country and we had to register them with the Consulate and when we got back to the US they got a Certificate of Citizenship&hellip;not a certificate of NaturaliZatrion as immigrants get when they become citizens. I doubt he has either</p>

		<p>You people are missing the point.</p>
<p>You want to continue to have white dominance of the country&rsquo;s political and social future and are using voter &#8216;licensing&rsquo; as a means to try and hang onto that control, for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Whatever the excuse, for or against, that is the bottom line.</p>
<p>And that is the bottom line that others are fighting -against-.</p>
<p>Until and unless you define that as a realistic goal you cannot force others to see that the reason whites want cultural dominance of our homeland is because the coming agenda of global corporate socialism is doomed to destroy us.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that we are particularly &#8216;noble&rsquo; in wanting to share it all.  It&rsquo;s that sharing it all is going to destroy us all.</p>
<p>Better them than us.</p>
<p>Racism, yes or no? is the question.  Race survival is the answer: We don&rsquo;t breed out of budget.  Everyone else does.  And thats how corporations get rich off of overproduction as junk consumerism.</p>

		<p>In Vermont you can now get a card that you can wave in front of a parking meter and when you come back that parking meter gives you your change back - in the past if you put in 50 cents you can now get 3 or 7 cents back if you are quick enough.</p>
<p>Just letting you guys know - if the will is there, the technology is there.</p>
<p>You can save 3 cents via an ID card but you can&rsquo;t identify voters because its too costly?</p>
<p>Pfft I guess - Maybe the United States should switch to a system like Mexico has where people who are born here aren&rsquo;t given automatic citizenship?</p>
<p>Nah, that&rsquo;d be racist.</p>
<p>Not for Mexico - becuase they are non-white, but for America - because they are still majority white.</p>

		<p>How exactly would this requirement discriminate against blacks? A voter can always show his prison ID. </p>

		<p>Do they realize how stupid they sound? Um..folks, there are no White Power guards standing outside the DMV keeping black people from walking in and getting ID. (However, when it comes to Philadelphia voting stations&hellip;.)</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve posted this before and I will post it again.  My sister lives in Germany.  Her and her families US address is my address.  One summer she and 3 English friends came to visit.  The friends left after a few days to tour other areas, my sister stayed.</p>
<p>Sister went to register to vote at city hall.  She brought passport, birth certificate, international and German driver&rsquo;s license etc.  To her shocked surprise she was not asked for any ID at all.  When her friends came back from their trip they heard about it and went down to city hall as a lark and also registered to vote.</p>
<p>All 3 English citizens voted absentee in the next presidential election.  They stil 15 years later get absentee ballots.</p>

		<p>&#8221; I&rsquo;m sure a &ldquo;low income&rdquo; person could take 15-25 dollars out of the beer, cigarette and cable TV budget to pay for an ID card if he or she doesn&rsquo;t have one.&#8221;</p>
<p>I live in Texas. A low income person does not have to pay anything, the state will provide it for free and if they are disabled and have trouble leaving their home, they can even have it done for them, so nobody has an excuse that they can&rsquo;t get an ID.</p>

		<p>They are suffering by this legislation because these &ldquo;Americans&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t American at all!<br>
In my own state you have to have an ID for alcohol (everyone all the time), an ID for voting, an ID for driving, an ID for going to school, and even school ID&rsquo;s to get about school functions, yet no one cries racism. Hell, you even have to have an ID for speeding tickets!</p>
<p><br>
No one will suffer who should not, that&rsquo;s like claiming that street patrols may discriminate against thugs!<br>
How will the poor illegal aliens be able to invade the nation if that nation requires them to be citizens? It&rsquo;s simply unfair!<br>

		<p>&#8220;Requiring voters to show ID would &ldquo;effectively return Texas to the days of Jim Crow.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>What the heck is wrong with this country?<br>
Asking people to show ID before voting?<br>
This is crazy.<br>
The next thing they will want you to do is:<br>
1. Show social security number before opening a savings account.<br>
2. Start asking for picture ID if you are stopped by police while driving.<br>
3.Show a picture ID before taking your check.<br>
When will this madness end? What about the illegals who Want To Vote or what about the Dead People who like to vote several times?<br>
Look at other countries They Welcome Americans and other foreigners  to vote and vote often in All Their Elections.<br>
(This Is Sarcasm I Hope You Know)</p>
