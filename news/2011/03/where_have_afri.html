<h1>Where Have African-American Baseball Players Gone?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Rob Ruck, Salon, March 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It&rsquo;s come to this: More African-Americans were elected to Congress as Republicans last November than appeared in the World Series. Texas Rangers reliever Darren Oliver was the sole African-American on the field. And while the number of black Republicans in Congress  &mdash;  two  &mdash;  is unlikely to grow any time soon, neither are the ranks of African-American major leaguers.</p>
<p>The meteoric rise and decline in African-American baseball has been staggering. Dark-skinned players, of course, were everywhere in the Series. They made up 40 percent of the players, but most came from the Caribbean or were Hispanic Americans. Few were U.S.-born blacks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before integration, African-American boys learned baseball on the other side of the racial boundary demarcating American sport. They played for sandlot and Negro League teams organized and managed by African-Americans. When that sporting infrastructure crumbled after integration, no alternative black-controlled institutions emerged. Black youth were left with fewer ways to learn the muscle memory, intricacies and lore of the game.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MLB was thrilled when C.C. Sabathia threw the first pitch of the 2009 World Series to Jimmy Rollins  &mdash;  only the second time a Series began with an African-American on the mound and another at bat. Both had played for RBI (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities), a program rebuilding baseball&rsquo;s infrastructure in hard-pressed areas. MLB, which backs RBI and promoted it relentlessly during the postseason, has committed to building an urban academy modeled after its Compton, Calif., facility in each of its franchise cities. One measure of this effort&rsquo;s success will be how many boys eventually sign professionally; another would be whether it helps repair the fabric of neighborhoods that MLB has long shunned. To do that, groups like the Josh Gibson Foundation in Pittsburgh need to lead the way. Sean Gibson, the Foundation&rsquo;s executive director and Josh&rsquo;s great-grandson, wants an academy built on the Hill, the historic heart of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s black community. &#8220;We are part of this community,&#8221; Gibson explained. &#8220;We want its needs served first and foremost. Baseball can help bring it back, but the community needs to lead the way.&#8221; Even with community buy-in and ongoing MLB support, the African-American contingent is not likely to return to its historic highs of the 1970s.</p>
<p>And baseball will be poorer for it. &#8220;All cultures bring something different to the game,&#8221; Mets outfielder Gary Matthews Jr. told the Times&rsquo; David Waldstein last spring as baseball celebrated Jackie Robinson Day. &#8220;The African American player, there is a charisma that he brings from his culture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a little spice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That little spice is missing when we&rsquo;re not participating.&#8221; Matthews, the lone African-American on the Mets that day, was released later that summer.</p>
<p>Baseball&rsquo;s tortured past was inextricably linked to its exclusion of African-Americans. Their subsequent entry into baseball was the game&rsquo;s finest moment. But its future most likely lies elsewhere, in the Caribbean and the nation&rsquo;s growing Latino communities.<br>

		<p>The article admits dark-skinned players are (more than) sufficiently represented, but diversiphiles always have alternative rationales for why there&rsquo;s still not enough diversity.  If it&rsquo;s not too few blacks, then it&rsquo;s too few American-born blacks.  If it&rsquo;s not too few American-born blacks, then it&rsquo;s too few blacks from Southwestern states or some subset of some other race.  </p>
<p>&#8220;More diversity&#8221; is an ideology, not a goal that could actually be met to its pushers&rsquo; satisfaction.  No Affirmative Action office ever shuts down upon the achievement of its purported goals when it was created.  </p>
<p>By the way, where have European-American basketball and football players gone?  Oh, mostly to the stands as spectators or the sidelines as cheerleaders where they belong.<br>

		<p>This pap reminds me of a schizophrenic article on the decline and fall of the formerly segregated &#8220;Negro Leagues.&#8221; The author of that article denounced Major League Baseball for its racism in maintaining segregation until 1947, but, without missing a beat, decried Major League Baseball for integrating its team rosters afterwards. By signing black players to contracts after negotiating to acquire the athletes from the blacks who owned the Negro League teams, the wicked Major League owners helped to destroy uniquely black institutions, namely Negro League baseball clubs. Without their star players, the black ball clubs withered and folded as their fans began to gravitate towards the Major League teams.</p>
<p>Please be aware that my references to the Negro Leagues are not intended to be controversial or offensive. Historically, this is what the league was called by everyone, white and black, at the time.</p>
<p>To debate such a topic is silly. Seriously, do you think blacks sit around bemoaning the absence of white players in the NBA?</p>
<p>The real reason that blacks quit playing baseball in great numbers is that other sports have been put on a paying basis and have surpassed baseball in popularity. In the so called &#8220;Golden Era,&#8221; baseball was the only sport that paid decent salaries. Every talented athlete, including many who excelled in other games, gravitated towards baseball because it paid the best wages. </p>

		<p> Yet another &#8220;pity the poor blacks&#8221; story. Is there no excuse that liberal writers will not use to try to put a guilt trip on those of us of the Caucasian persuasion?</p>
<p> When the game of major league baseball is as thoroughly dominated as it now is by darker-skinned Hispanics, many of them actually of African descent themselves, don&rsquo;t expect me to get all teary-eyed because there aren&rsquo;t &#8220;enough&#8221; U.S.-born blacks out there.</p>
<p> And by the way: Where was this writer when the number of White players in the NBA was steadily dropping to its present abysmal level of 10 percent? Isn&rsquo;t that a reason for alarm, too? Or does &#8220;unfairness&#8221; land only on the heads of the dark, and not on  the sunny locks of the White race? </p>

		<p>African-American kids in considerable numbers refuse to even  consider playing baseball. Those that do, who are top athletes, do well in the game. Three sport star Dave Winfield chose baseball. Now is in the Hall of Fame. Bo Jackson played baseball and football. Did pretty good in baseball. Kenny Lofton chose baseball over basketball after leaving the University of Arizona, where he starred in basketball. Retired with 2,428 major league hits and 1,528 runs scored. Carl Crawford turned down college scholarships in football and basketball to play baseball. He just signed a $20-million-a-year contract with the Boston Red Sox.</p>
<p>Build it, brothers, and they will come. Oh, and you can play minor league baseball without college, even without high school. You even get paid for it. If you&rsquo;re really an athlete, they&rsquo;ll give you chance to learn even if you have little baseball experience, maybe none.</p>
<p>There are fewer black American in baseball because the kids don&rsquo;t aspire to it. When you&rsquo;re 18 years old, four years of bus rides and small town stadiums doesn&rsquo;t compare to the dream of collegiate glory, the willing coeds black and white, and the under the table &#8220;perks&#8221; provided by wealthy alums and boosters.</p>
<p>Somewhat the same for those who play scholarship sports in college. After they fail to make the NFL or NBA, how many want to sign up for the no-glory world of minor league baseball and small chance of making the major leagues? Not too many.</p>

<p>Not true. Baseball is still over 60% white.</p>
<p>&#8220;And by the way: Where was this writer when the number of White players in the NBA was steadily dropping to its present abysmal level of 10 percent?&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually it is about 24% white but I take your point.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s natural and easier for young blacks to play pick-up basketball games; wild street ball, less discipline. It has evolved to be accepted more and more on college &amp; pro teams.</p>
<p>My brother played baseball and basketball up until high school. (His not trying out for either sport in high school is still a sore subject for my dad. But, it&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s life.) He was a stand out in all aspects of both sports.-Tall, fast, (faster than most blacks) superb athlete. There were more white father &amp; son/coach &amp; player duos than there were black. Most of those fathers and sons went above and beyond their normal practice times; owning batting cages, baseball camps galore, &amp; baseball was their only sport. (My dad coached and we both went to differnt types of sport camps, but my brother was always the best at any activity.)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to this All-American game. That&rsquo;s why it ends up being mostly white. </p>

		<p>My dad taught me to play baseball.  Eye always on the ball, always follow the ball into the glove with your throwing hand, think of your body as a spring, shift your weight forward and step into your swing.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t just get by in this sport being a big galoot that can run, jump, carry your dribble, and take a 3-step layup.  Fundamentals are essential, and the rules of baseball are too rigid to be bent for creative ghetto renditions of the sport.  </p>
<p>Would I have learned to play without a strong male role model to teach me the intricacies of the game?</p>
<p>Probably not.  I think it really is that simple.</p>

		<p>This is an interesting subject. One that is quite difficult to get at, but I&rsquo;ll try to point out a few things people don&rsquo;t understand about the &#8220;Negro Leagues.&#8221; The first thing to get straight is the word league is quite deceiving. Most of the leagues were slip shod affairs with teams going broke and leaving the league during the season and other entering during different periods. The teams never played the same amount of games. Championships were more or less decided by consensus. Players &#8220;contracts were about the same. The player lived up to the contract, or he didn&rsquo;t. There were instances of a player changing teams in between games of a double header. Many times, a barnstorming team would have to augment their roster with local players if a car broke down with players getting to the game.</p>
<p>Any real semblance of stability was given by the white people who had some of the clubs and the White people who set up the games. The most successful team in Negro League history, the Kansas City Monarchs were White owned. Only in one case, did the team own a stadium. Otherwise, they had to find a place to play and pay rent. Many teams played in the rented major league stadiums when the Major league team way away. </p>
<p>The quality of play ranged anywhere from single A/sandlot ball<br>
to AA and in a very few cases for short periods AAA. The pitching might have a top hurler, but very little after him. Fundamentals were lacking at all levels. Very few understood where to throw the ball in different situations, etc. The Negro Leagues did allow most of it&rsquo;s members to follow their dream of playing pro ball, something they would never have been able to do if they had to try out for a majors. </p>
<p>A little aside on Jackie Robinson. Jackie Robinson broke his contract with the Kansas City Monarchs to sign with the Dodgers.<br>
I guess the Dodgers and the White ownership of the Monarchs came to some sort of understanding to let it go.</p>
<p>As far as the idea of there not being many African American players in the majors anymore, it&rsquo;s just more of the AfricanAmerican experience. They&rsquo;re not able to keep up. We&rsquo;ve seen this time and again in every walk of life in this country. It&rsquo;s nothing new for them to make a bit of a splash and then fade over time.</p>
<p>This is a very interesting subject, but also shrouded in mystery. The main stream newspapers of the time didn&rsquo;t cover the Negro Leagues and the coverage in the black press was very spotty. It&rsquo;s quite hard to find that coverage because there are no records of that time from the black press (nothing new there). Most of the books covering this are nothing but propaganda. </p>

		<p>Oh liberals, you poor, poor liberals.  When the &#8216;wrong&rsquo; kind of diversity happens, you say: &#8220;Oh the woe!&#8221;</p>
<p>You cannot &#8216;engineer&rsquo; the perfect mix, whatever that is, and so you cry.  Your precious &#8216;african&rsquo; americans are being left in the dust by other black and brown skinned people.  What did you think was gonna happen when you preached for open borders, sanctuary cities and illegal immigration?</p>
<p>An outside people is racing ahead of your &#8216;american&rsquo; blacks, and it never even dawns on you that they never move ahead because of too much disfunction from within, starting with you enablers of indolency!</p>

		<p>Question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where Have African-American Baseball Players Gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p>Baseball takes a lot of strategic thinking, discipline and a sacrificial team mentality. </p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>These are not the &#8216;qualities&rsquo; that blacks posses. </p>

		<p>The author Ruck is full of baloney when he says that Juan Marichal and other Latino stars came in after Jackie Robinson &#8220;integrated&#8221; baseball. According to Ruck, this was in the late 1950&rsquo;s, when Latinos first entered baseball.</p>
<p>Ruck forgets that Adolfo Luque played for the Cincinnati Reds during the 1920&rsquo;s. He was a native of Cuba - therefore  a true Latino - albeit, he was not a black Cuban (like Mike Cuellar or Tony Perez), but a white Cuban a la Fidel Castro. He was a decent pitcher for the Reds, and had a couple of 20-win seasons for them. The White Sox had Chico Carrasquel, a fine shortstop, on the team since the early 1950&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll credit Ruck for admitting that black boys are more likely to grow up without a father to teach them the nuances of baseball at an early age. But, he doesn&rsquo;t mention that parks in the inner city do not lend themselves to ballplaying, like they did in the past.</p>

		<p>One of the more shameful aspects of white culture is the replacement of sports heroes with non-whites&hellip;.a form of worship of non-whites, particularly blacks.</p>
<p>What makes it particularly shameful is, almost always, there are far superior white athletes.  Faster, tougher, white football players, far more accurate basketball players, better hitters, faster runners, and boxers who can&rsquo;t even come close to being defeated by their non-white counterparts.</p>
<p>Why aren&rsquo;t they the sports legends being paid millions?  Racism.  Better white players are routinely dismissed.  Every once in awhile a story leaks out about how this is true or our Eastern European cousins field an unstoppable athlete, particularly in the combat arts (boxing, MMA, etc.)</p>
<p>Whites ignore it, worship the non-whites with heads bowed and wallets open.</p>
<p>Why is this an extremely important thing to understand?  In every culture, every race, every period of time, the alpha males ruled the rest with iron fists. Our alpha males were VERY generous to us&hellip;.creating egalitarian societies with fairness, the rule of law, and, let&rsquo;s face it, a luxurious standard of living.  Alpha males and no one else is responsible for that.  Their reward?  To be stabbed in the back, forgotten, often marginalized.  Betrayal to other groups who hate us, and would enslave us (have already enslaved us).</p>
<p>One day, our alpha males will set the situation right.  It is literally encoded genetically in their DNA to do so.</p>
<p>Let me ask something.  What motivation have we given them over the last 100 years to treat us well?  Heck, what motivation have we given them to treat us as anything less than dangerous fools in dire need of micromanagement.</p>
<p>One day, democracy will probably be remembered as a great idea we simply weren&rsquo;t worthy of.  And as your king/warlord/dictator or perhaps simply slavemaster, demands of you while returning scraps for anything less than total and absolute obedience, ponder how it could have been different.</p>
<p>Had we been loyal.</p>

		<p>Just another reason to take your son (&/or daughter) to baseball games while they are growing up. Maybe they will make the connection between sportsman like conduct on the field and the idiocy that passes for celebration in the NFL &amp; NBA. One question that is rarely asked is: Why don&rsquo;t you have epic scandals in college baseball like those you hear of regularly in football and basketball? </p>
<p>I live near a major metropolitan area with an NFL franchise and have only been to one game (I was given the tickets). However, I have been to a number of baseball games. It&rsquo;s nice to enjoy the whiteness of the crowd. </p>

		<p>Few blacks can play. Hand to eye coordination skill is not there and they cant pitch. Everybody knows a rare black pitcher Oaklands Vida Blue threw Aaron a big fat pitch right down the middle so he could hit #715 and break Ruths record in &#8216;74 killing 2 birds with one stone helping his bro and being the famous pitcher. Blue was unknown before that.</p>

		<p>Blacks love the notoriety and lavish garbage that being rich can provide - thus being &#8216;afleets&rsquo;. The few American born athletic blacks are divided into two groups: the fat ones and the tall ones. The fat ones play football; the tall ones play basketball. Football is much more suited to the fat athletic blacks, as football is a thuggish, beat-em-up and pound-on-em type of game. Right up the blacks&rsquo; alley. The tall ones can virtually stand on the ground and drop a ball through a hoop; run to the other end of the court and do the same thing. A pretty easy way to become a God. </p>
<p>The in-betweeners are left with baseball. Being fat is a detriment there, and height offers little advantage other than perhaps a bit of a longer throw and strike zone. Along with the fact that the races are more evenly divided between the races, which doesn&rsquo;t sit well with the black tribal mentality. They can make much more money with much less work dealing crack on the corner.</p>

		<p>I am a big baseball fan myself.  I root for the Toronto Blue Jays of MLB and have been to the ballpark in Toronto a plenty of times.  I have been there quite a few times but never ever received a souvenir yet.  I promised myself I will get one this summer.  </p>
<p>One of the well-known liberal local newspapers in Toronto, is named the Toronto Star, and one of their sports columnists accused the Toronto Blue Jays organization of having too many Caucasian players, and called the organization, &#8220;Toronto White Jays&#8221;.  </p>
<p>In the following day, the ballclub presented a counter-accusation, stating that the majority of employees at the Toronto Star were caucasian.  </p>
<p>The title of the counter-accusation was &#8220;The Toronto White Star&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Since the Star accused of the ballclub for having a majority Caucasian roster, the team occasionally forced itself to deliberately overpay to entice a few black players to sign with and play for the Blue Jays.</p>
<p>I did not even notice the majority of Blue Jays players were Caucasian until the moment the Toronto Star mentioned it.  </p>
<p>The Blue Jays never had any Korean player, but did have a couple of Japanese pitchers in the past, named Tomo Ohka and Mike Nakamura.  They both are retired now.  </p>
<p>Speaking of Japan, I know a very lovely girl named Emi, who was born in Japan, but came to Canada for roughly a year to learn English.  She and I used to volunteer once every week to help with the dishes at a church to feed less fortunate elders in Toronto.  She also enjoyed having conversations with the local elders in Toronto, which helped her improve her English language skills.  She went back to Japan a few months ago.  </p>
<p>It broke my heart when I read that Japan is suffering from the multiple natural disasters, and I quickly looked at the map of Japan to see if the city where Emi lives in (Akai, in Southwestern part of Japan) was affected by the disasters, and felt very relieved to realize that the city she lives in was extremely unlikely to be affected, </p>
<p>and when she posted on facebook that she and her family members were safe, my palms were wet with my tears for a few minutes!! </p>
<p>I read, as soon as the disasters happened, South Korea immediately sent a rescue team to Japan, I was very glad, and made me feel rather proud, to read that.  I hope China does the same shortly.  The president of South Korea stated that South Korea is indeed responsible, willing, and ready to give any type of assistance that Japan might need for the next little while.</p>
<p>Regarding the nuclear plants in Japan melting down and being very unstable&hellip;.  there are a lot of papers around the world claiming the nuclear plants might lead to thousands of deaths in the next several days if the government of Japan does not take adequate actions to cool down the nuclear plants.  The reports indicated that the deaths caused by the unstable nuclear plants might possibly lead to deaths a few times that of the total number of deaths caused by the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during the World War 2.    </p>
<p>but the smartest, most experienced nuclear scientists in Japan say the nuclear plants are under control and nobody will suffer any injury caused by the nuclear plants being unstable, but all of the media reporters are either being dishonestly exaggerating in order to make a bit more profit, or they do not have sufficient amount of knowledge in the field at all to put together correct reports.  I admit I am not very knowledgeable in that field either.  </p>

		<p>The same article comes up in some form every spring.  They never adress the real problem.  Black youth are about as interested in baseball as I am in rap music.  The writers always talk to the reader as if its some kind of national emergency.  How about talking to the black youths directly.  In order to solve this &#8220;crisis&#8221; they are the ones who will need to develope the skills to one day make it in the bigs.  But, as always, they want someone else to do it for them.  Who?  The owners, the scouts, the fans, who is going to do it for you?  </p>
<p>Last year the article featured in Amren placed the blame on scouts and owners bringing up players from the Caribbean and other Latin American countries at a higher rate than American Blacks then calling it racism.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  The youth of those countries practice the game 7 days a week year &#8216;round.  They will be leaps and bounds better than American Blacks AND American Whites who practice far less.  Say what you want about where they should or should not get their players.  It is a business and they will FIND the best talent.  Whether it be Kansas, Harlem, or the Dominican.</p>
<p> All black sports writers, ex-great players, city leaders, etc&hellip; can go to any urban area and ask black youth age 10 to 18 what they think of baseball.  They will be told it is too slow, too boring, too old, lame, stupid, no excitement, not enough room for individual boasting and too white.  In the 1950&rsquo;s there was BASEBALL for the urban youth.  Now there are hundreds of activities and baseball is at the bottom.</p>
<p>Finally, Jackie Robinson is a great champion of minority achiement in all sports.  Rightly so.  Go to any of our great urban centers and ask any 12 year old who he was and what he was known for.  You will get two answers: I dunno and who cares.  Sad but true.   </p>

		<p>My fondest Afro-American baseball memory is when the underachieving Garry (sic) Templeton gave the fans of St. Louis the middle finger for booing his lack of hustle as he returned to the dugout.  Manager Whitey (love that name) Herzog climbed the dugout steps and pulled Templeton off the field.  Templeton was then traded to San Diego that off season. How many whites would have the courage to do that to a black loafer these days?</p>

		<p>Baseball is a unique sport because you cannot succeed on athletic ability alone. You must have skills and discipline that take decades to develop. Even an athlete as great as Michael Jordan could not succeed in baseball. I have to tip my hat to him for trying. I saw him in several games with the Birmingham Barons and he just lacked the baseball skills.</p>
<p>It takes dedicated parents to help a child learn baseball. There are hundreds of trips to practice and games, hundreds of hours in the backyard, and years of encouragement.</p>
<p>Here in Tuscaloosa we have small private black school, Stillman College. Their baseball coach and almost all their players are white. They are always very successful playing the other black schools in their league. They even advertise on television telling high school players that Stillman is a good place to continue their careers.</p>
