<h1>When Test Scores Don&rsquo;t Add Up: 32 Metro Detroit Schools Show Improvements Too Good To Be True</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Peggy Walsh-Sarnecki, Chastity Pratt Dawsey and Kristi Tanner-White, Detroit Free Press, March 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Each year, millions of children in Michigan and across the nation take state standardized tests that impact everything from a school&rsquo;s reputation to how teachers will be evaluated to whether schools will even survive.</p>
<p>The pressures to perform, experts say, tempt some school administrators and teachers to cheat.</p>
<p>The Free Press, as part of a http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2011-03-06-school-testing_N.htm&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;&gt;nationwide investigation with USA TODAY and other partners, analyzed millions of test score results and found that 34 schools across Michigan  &mdash;  32 of them in metro Detroit  &mdash;  showed test score gains over a one-year period that experts say are statistically improbable. More broadly, the analysis found 304 schools in six states and the District of Columbia that had test scores so improbable, they should be investigated. Besides Michigan, the states were Arizona, Colorado, California, Florida and Ohio.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Education reformers caution against jumping to the conclusion that a surge in scores reflects cheating. But experts in testing procedures say the increases exceed what can be reasonably expected.</p>
<p>The pressure to raise test scores is enormous, particularly among schools that fail to meet the requirements of the federal No Child Left Behind law. And with that pressure, the incentive to help students cheat also is growing, the experts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But high leaps and other indicators also signal that the scores might be too good to be true, he and other experts said.<br>
{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Student reports consistently showed a pattern of improper assistance by school staff in answering MEAP test items,&#8221; the state investigation concluded.</p>
<p>The Michigan Department of Education ordered the school to tighten its testing procedures and be subject to close monitoring by the Office of Educational Assessment and Accountability.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In its own report, state officials noted that Crofoot fourth-graders taking the math test went from being 39% proficient in 2003 to 87% proficient in 2004, and 100% proficient in 2005. Fourth-graders taking the reading test went from being 52% proficient in 2003 to 84% proficient in 2004 to 89% in 2005.</p>
<p>Such massive improvements in test scores  &mdash;  while not conclusive proof that test tampering has taken place  &mdash;  are statistically improbable and should be investigated, experts say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Yet wild gains in test scores don&rsquo;t trigger investigations of cheating in Michigan. The state opens up investigations only if a credible allegation is raised. Like most states, Michigan leaves the implementation of guidelines for administering the MEAP up to the school districts.</p>
<p>Fremer said the idea of investigating high scores seems ridiculous to most officials. The response often is: &#8220;You want me to investigate when scores are going up? What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An analysis of Michigan scores from 2007 to 2009 found 83 schools statewide with standard deviations of three or more. When focused more narrowly on 2008 to 2009, it found 34 such schools  &mdash;  32 of them in metro Detroit.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In at least 10 states, teacher pay already is  &mdash;  or is about to be  &mdash;  linked to test scores. Several school districts in Michigan have tied teacher salaries to test scores, too. Under a 2009 state law, school districts have until September to develop plans to make student test scores a significant part of teacher evaluations. Michigan also plans to raise the bar for what is considered proficient on the MEAP, saying schools aren&rsquo;t adequately preparing students for college.</p>
<p>The federal No Child Left Behind law penalizes schools that fail to make &#8220;adequate yearly progress,&#8221; often leading to staff being reassigned or schools being closed. Most of the 130 schools in Detroit Public Schools that have closed since 2005 were cited for having low test scores.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Across the nation, incidents of testing irregularities abound  &mdash;  cheating has been found in Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York and South Carolina, according to FairTest, a Massachusetts nonprofit that aims to prevent the misuse of standardized tests.</p>
<p>In Georgia last year, the state investigated 191 schools, including many in Atlanta, following an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report identifying schools with unusual gains. The state has subsequently begun collecting erasure data  &mdash;  the number of times an answer is erased on a test and the number of times it has been changed from wrong to right  &mdash;  to trigger investigations.</p>
<p>Failing to investigate questionable scores could mask students&rsquo; real gains and academic needs, said John Tanner, executive director of San Antonio-based Test Sense, an organization that helps schools make use of test scores.</p>

		<p>What ridiculous machinations we go through because we can&rsquo;t recognize we didn&rsquo;t all evolve the same capabilities.    I certainly understand why teachers and there unions didn&rsquo;t want incentive pay based on test results.   I think at the individual level teachers understand better then the rest of us the falsity of &ldquo;all beings created equal&rdquo; however they are a collectivist bunch and are too vested in maintaining the system as it stands then to broach the truth.  </p>

<p>Cheating could accomplish so much if all that fussing would be stopped. Blacks have high test scores and are happy, teachers can earn their pay based on test results, officials can be happy at the improvements inner city schools have made, Maybe they can now happily stay in their own schools and do not need whitey anymore to somehow raise their ed. level. Everything honky dory. </p>
<p>This by the way is nothing new.  Back in the sixties the principal from our school decreed that black children get an A where a white child will get a C. What could he do? The government was breathing down his neck to bring up <br>
 grades of black students, and that was the only way that worked. The blacks were happy. </p>
<p>Later, in an overseas American High school, a &#8220;wonderful&#8221; black teacher was found out to have given students the test scores the day  before a test. Just give blacks high grades and eliminate a lot of stress. </p>

		<p>Atlanta is now famous for this as well.  Blacks don&rsquo;t need REAL achievements to feel good about themselves.  All they need is a shiny trinket they can show off.  NONE of the parents of the children who were cheated are willing to go after the school administrators responsible because they are black.  This problem will never be solved with logic.<br>

No Child Left Behind makes teachers even less willing than they used to be to teach in inner city schools. You can&rsquo;t teach what is not there. <br>

		<p>To poster #2, this solution is already being implemented nationwide, and has been in operation for many years.  </p>
<p>I know this for a fact across three states and seven school districts.  (Liberal &#8216;social justice&rsquo; types are at the forefront of all the grade inflation, false test scores, etc but many of us who are against that have wisened up and know that sometimes you have to hold your nose in an impossible situation rather than endure the unemployment line.)  </p>
<p>Latinos are now benefitting from this, as only about 10% of them can function without the extra &#8216;boost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If students, all students, were held to &#8216;white&rsquo; american standards, such as we who were born before 1980 were, then the black latino graduation rate nationwide would be in the single digits.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; marches all over the place then?  Keep the peace.  Pass Shaquana and Pablo and continue to live the fiction.  That&rsquo;s what everyone wants.</p>

		<p>i think in cases like this the long view is needed. These &#8220;people&#8221; who have an inferior intellect are shuffled through the system until they hit the job market. When no one hires them because of incompetency they immediately yell &#8220;discrimination&#8221;. For whites who are not hired their only recourse is to try harder&hellip;and they do. The problem is when too many of &#8220;those people&#8221; then the wheels come off as no one is there to make the corrections. Scary to think of when its realized who could be in charge in the future. </p>

		<p>sshadow,</p>
<p>Self selection:  Only cheaters can survive is the logical imperative.</p>
<p>If the government sets up impossible criteria for school officials to meet, then any school teacher who won&rsquo;t cheat will be fired.  Schools serving the tougher projects can&rsquo;t expect the average IQ of their blacks to be the oft quoted 85.  Hard stats will be hard to come by, but an average of 75-80 would be reasonable enough, which is roughly 1 SD below the black average.  That coupled with no motivation and no parenting predict proficiency in the single digits. In this range most will be functionally illiterate even with motivation.  There is only one way to achieve 89% or 100% proficiency in these schools. </p>

		<p>Some of you are giving the teachers a pass for doing this when they are operating on a leftist agenda to dumb down White children to equalize everyone.  Because of this I&rsquo;m not so certain that if the government and &#8220;No Child Left Learning&#8221; were no longer influencing education that teachers would start holding students to some standards. Education is becoming increasingly like civil service which is nothing but a glorified jobs mill for people who can&rsquo;t cut it in the private sector.  This extends not only into public schools but also colleges and universities.  I had a string of bad professors when I was pursuing my degree.  Instructors who wouldn&rsquo;t show up for class and just write the assignments on the board for students to complete the next class session or classes where teachers weren&rsquo;t teaching but giving out assignments and leaving us on our own.  Our educational system is a joke and it&rsquo;s also a national security issue because this dysfunction translates into an increasingly illiterate workforce that can&rsquo;t even compete with developing nations.  I predict that as public schools become more and more nonwhite and Whites either homeschool or go to private institutions that taxpayers will become increasingly unwilling to pay for public education and they&rsquo;ll vote their interests.  This will result in alot of cutbacks including teachers&rsquo; salaries and a return to the basics like reading, writing and arithmetic.  The competition among private institutions will result in them getting more quality teachers and also the best paying jobs.   </p>

		<p>Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Capital of the Third World:</p>
<p><i>The Los Angeles Board of Education is set to shut down six charter schools across the city that have been accused of cheating on 2010 standardized tests.</i></p>
<p><i>Executive director of schools John Allen, founder of the Crescendo organization, allegedly ordered principals and teachers to use actual test questions to get them ready for the exams. Several teachers at the schools alerted the district about the tactics.</i></p>
<p>Notice it was the *teachers* (last time I use that grammatical &#8220;radical/chic&#8221; demarcation, I swear, besides, it&rsquo;s already jumped the shark) who blew the proverbial whistle; if the school were caught, any teacher with experience knows the administration and charter operator would immediately assign 100% of the blame to teachers, deflecting any wrongdoing from themselves.</p>
<p>The cheating issue is a little deeper than the insanity of tying teacher pay to test scores, or money-grubbing Charter-school operators desperately needing to prove they are doing a better job than the socialist-run government schools in order to renew their lucrative contracts. </p>
<p>Hell, if a school run by a White-hating Mexican that teaches &#8220;Mayan&#8221; math, the Nahuatl language and emphasizes Mexican culture, collective governance, and anti-Americanism as its three main focal points can have its charter (and funds) repeatedly re-approved by the LA school trustees what&rsquo;s the big deal about a little cheating on state tests?  The new superintendent himself doesn&rsquo;t seem to think this is a big deal and has stated that the school may yet have its charter renewed.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s also this issue concerning high-stakes testing:  the newer cohort of teachers, overwhelmingly non-White, ill educated, dumb as a box of rocks, entrenched in the marxist religion, full of meaningless, stupid slogans and ed school claptrap, considers <b>all</b> of these test to be inherently meaningless and <b>racist.</b></p>
<p>Because the tests are reflective of and geared to Whites by an oppressive system, they claim, no student &#8220;of color&#8221; can possibly hope to do well (and hence the achievement gap).  The tests measure nothing, they state like automotons, only reflecting one&rsquo;s ability to take tests, perfectly regurgitating what their Ayers-inspired instructors and <i>Pedegogy of the Oppressed</i>, the ed school Bible, has drummed into them.</p>
<p>Outright blatant cheating, lack of integrity, blaming the tests instead of lack of ability and little to no concern over the implications of fraud are sure signs of End of Empire, a marker of entrenched corruption, dissonance and lack of standards.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is hanging on to by a thread.  Eventually, all merit-based tests will be declared &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; and race will trump achievement.</p>
<p>And, it won&rsquo;t be the White race.</p>

		<p>Around late 1967, the middle school that my oldest sister attended was being pressured by the NAACP to start taking a few blacks (the busing mandate had not been handed down by the Supreme Court yet). The principal was starting to receive a lot of flack from his superiors downtown so he told them the arrange a meeting with the &#8220;brightest kid they have&#8221;. This turned out to be a kid we&rsquo;ll call Lewis. Lewis was sharper than most blacks, but in reality had a 105 - 110 IQ. This principal had a couple of years until retirement and even spent a couple of years as the principal of a black elementary school during WWII. He had no illusions about what to expect and tried to derail this thing from the beginning. </p>
<p>Lewis was brought in and assigned with the kids who were in the Honors type program (120 and above IQ&rsquo;s). As you can imagine, Lewis was lost from day one. In typical fashion, he started acting up in class, asking really stupid questions, etc. Instead of derailing the process, this principal really caught a lot of heat from his bosses downtown and nearly lost his job. My oldest sister and a friend of hers got their one trip (ever) to the principal&rsquo;s office because the teacher caught them writing a poem about what a dim bulb Lewis was. My dad and the other girl&rsquo;s father had to intervene, lest the principal might have suspended them for a couple of weeks. Lewis quietly transferred to another white middle school and was placed in the middle performers class. However, within a couple of years, there was a flood of blacks thanks to busing and many of the white teachers either left the profession or took newly created jobs at the private schools in town. </p>
<p>Those teachers then could see the writing on the wall. I&rsquo;m not sure if they ever thought that pay would be tied to student performance. But then this was a generation of (mostly) women who had few illusions about levels of achievement. My mother in law started at a public school around this era, but retired after 30 years at a private school. </p>

		<p>As a former school teacher, what everyone has heard is true</p>
<p>when it pertains to Black students and their violent and</p>
<p>inattentive attitudes while in school.  Black and retarded</p>
<p>students, should not be mainstreamed into White classrooms,</p>
<p>but rather should be schooled in buildings equipped with</p>
<p>teachers whom have been trained how to manage these types</p>
<p>of behaviors and mental disorders.  In addition, there needs</p>
<p>to be a study conducted as to why Blacks find it difficult to</p>
<p>conform to the rules in White schools or in civilian</p>
<p>communities, as the prison records can attest to their inability</p>
<p>to assimilate and conform.  It is a shame that this type of </p>
<p>study has not been earlier performed, because there could</p>
<p>have been a medicine developed to assist Blacks overall, in</p>
<p>assisting their aggresive behavior.</p>

<p>Oh, but this is so true.  I cannot think of one fellow &#8216;teacher&rsquo; in my building, who is non-white, who I would trust as a teacher for my own kids.  They have some passion, yes.  They speak the lingo and the body language of the kids.  (In fact, they act just like them!)  So much so that they are routinely mistaken for students by security and other teachers from other floors, but they are so marxist in orientation.  I feel like Che Guevara or Jay Z will walk in the teachers lounge any minute!</p>
<p>For the life of me I cannot recall a time when I thought of them: &#8220;Hmmm, what a smart teacher.&#8221;  </p>
<p>When they describe or show their student projects in teacher meetings, it&rsquo;s all baby work (this is high school).  &#8220;Look at all the pretty colors!  Look!  Darnell Quantavious showed how to find slope and drew a pic of Stewie from Family Guy!  Awesome!&#8221;  (Actual project, btw.)</p>
<p>Too bad he either copied or was directly coached by the teacher for the tiny math portion of the project.  Minority teachers also get a free pass in the cussing, cursing and losing their cool department, especially black staff members.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m at (and have been), the black teachers can literally yell at the top of their lungs at students, using every choice word, and no one says a word, not even any admins.  Latino &#8216;teachers&rsquo; get a free pass with being very physical and touchy-feely with the students - hugging them, kissing their cheeks, play fighting, mild sexual banter, etc.  I see it every day.</p>
<p>The young, white women are not much better.  Most, and I am speaking from voluminous observation, have a flirting and touching problem with the black male students.  Not with the latino students mostly, but with the biggest, blackest thug types.  Content knowledge is nearly non-existent and they teach out of hastily made photocopies, employ that project-based learning garbage and infuse everything with &#8216;social justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As one of the few white males in this building, I pick up a lot of slack around here, keep my head down, bob my head in agreement when social justice slogans are aired, and silently lament the loss of a great nation to the chaos that is coming.  </p>

		<p>To number 9,</p>
<p>I know a school that is 70 percent non-white but produces top notch scores in math and science. I have the solution to closing and even reversing the white-minority gap. Bring in more Asians so Asians outnumber Blacks and Latinos and the problem will be solved. Everyone check out this link; <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_17606226?source=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_17606226?source=rss</a></p>
<p>The media will NEVER discuss the fact that such schools are 70 percent non-white and more successful than &#8220;all white&#8221; schools.</p>

		<p><i>Some of you are giving the teachers a pass for doing this when they are operating on a leftist agenda to dumb down White children to equalize everyone</i></p>
<p>About much of what you say I cannot argue.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in a state like mine (California) that is becoming increasingly non-White (as is everywhere else, it seems) the voters WILL vote in the interests of themselves   &mdash;   which will mean MORE school bonds, more money for teachers&rsquo; salaries and pensions, more money to educate the ineducable   &mdash;   more good money thrown after bad.</p>
<p>And yes, many teachers are automatons with desires to make everyone equal which does mean dumbing down our White children.  This is why I, as a school teacher, implore parents of White children to immediately pull their precious children out of government socialist schools, do it now, and don&rsquo;t look back.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t regret it.</p>
<p>You see, there are still a few of us traditional types in the schools, we who are not lefty drones spewing marxist drivel, although our numbers are quickly and drastically shrinking.</p>

<p><i>Everyone check out this link; <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_17606226?source=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_17606226?source=rss</a></i></p>
<p>The media will NEVER discuss the fact that such schools are 70 percent non-white and more successful than &ldquo;all white&rdquo; schools.</p>
<p>Well the media, from your link clearly does disclose a school that is 70% non-White and is quite successful, of course those students are Asian. There&rsquo;s a good reason the term NAM (non-Asian minority..) was coined.. it&rsquo;s for those particular minorities we don&rsquo;t want moving to our neighborhoods or going to our schools. <br>
