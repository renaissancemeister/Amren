<h1>African Dictator&rsquo;s Son Orders Luxury Superyacht</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michelle Faul, Yahoo! News, Feb. 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The son of Equatorial Guinea&rsquo;s dictator of 30 years commissioned plans to build a superyacht costing $380 million, nearly three times what the country spends on health and education each year, a corruption watchdog said Monday.</p>
<p>The statement from Global Witness said that German company Kusch Yachts has been asked to build the yacht, housing a cinema, restaurant, bar and swimming pool, though construction has not yet started.</p>
<p>Global Witness has been urging Washington to institute sanctions against Teodorin Obiang, whose extravagant lifestyle currently includes a $35 million-dollar mansion in Malibu, California, a $33 million jet and a fleet of luxury cars, while earning a salary of $6,799 a month as agriculture minister.</p>
<p>The government press office in Equatorial Guinea confirmed that the president&rsquo;s son had ordered the yacht design, but said he &#8220;then dismissed the idea of buying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It said that if the order had gone ahead, he would have bought it with income from private business activities and not &#8220;with funds derived from sources of illegal financing or corruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The tiny West African nation may be oil rich, but U.N. statistics show that 20 percent of children in Equatorial Guinea die before reaching the age of 5, and the average citizen is unlikely to live beyond 50. The State Department report on human rights also has condemned  killings by security forces and the torture of prisoners.</p>

		<p>If his opulent spending bothers all these white liberals so much, why don&rsquo;t they lean on the purveyors of the yachts, houses and cars not to do business with him?  Honestly, it&rsquo;s probably better that he spends all that money on yachts and cars   &mdash;   It will do the world far better in the long run than wasting it on the hopeless task of educating low IQ Equatorial Guineans.</p>

		<p>Oil rich Equitorial Guinea handles its banking though New York, which makes us no strangers to this regime.</p>
<p>As black Africans, our white &#8216;human rights&rsquo; crusaders will leave them alone, as blacks abusing other blacks rarely rates a mention. </p>

		<p>Mark Thatcher and his band of South African mercenaries tried to mount a coup d&rsquo;etat in Equatorial Guinea a few years back  &mdash;  good thing they were stopped  &mdash;  it would have been a tragedy had the country faced a change in leadership.</p>

		<p>Given the stability of African regimes, I would hope Kusch Yachts gets payment in full before construction starts.  I can just imagine a huge yacht built to African tastes and specifications.  </p>

Obiangs big chief lifestyle is tribal.<br>
If America had a reality show and a website that asked to fill in a bullet question concerning the moral decisions of the EG government, it could be as entertaining as a game of limbo in a sandals vacation.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether it was your topic but in Germany a very lot of small business went bankrupt after doing their services for African Presidents because they were never paid.<br>
The black dictators always said things like: &#8220;The white men should be happy that we give them all the resources even after slavery.&#8221; </p>

		<p>Wonder if splc will list this fool as a hater?  You would have to be hate filled to conduct your life this way with your country in dire straits.  </p>
<p>Oh, where is michelles next trip with her 200 person entourage?  Oh, and the bust of Churchill went back to England out of love&hellip;sorry we just need to know those things.</p>
<p>Is this extravagance somewhat genetic? or just the hate part?</p>

<p>No. Why should they bear the onus of this? They take the business wherever they can get it and it&rsquo;s not their responsibility  to question where the money came  from. They are boat builders, not policemen. </p>
<p>Anyhow, the money trickles back into Europe  this way, and that&rsquo;s a benefit to us.  To spend it on African &#8220;education&#8221; or other social programs would be throwing it away even worse. </p>
<p>But I agree that they should take pains to get a large deposit IN ADVANCE!  </p>

		<p> I read this in several media outlets,,,sure corruption,bribes graft etc affect virtually every country on the globe to various degrees but in sub Sahara Africa it appears to be greatly accenctuated and taken to an unprecedented level ..I remeber a story a few years ago about another country,possibly Kenya, trying to order a fleet of superluxury cars that were close to the national budget,,,the mind boggles <br>
and it seems that the quagmire most Africans have sunk into has no bottom no matter how much money and aid Western nations keep throwing at it</p>

		<p>Fact about this little country:  its average IQ is 59, the lowest in the world (Sao Tome/Principe is purportedly also 59).  Do note that there are many part-Portuguese (part-white) people in both these countries:  if the IQ average included them, take a guess about what the average black IQ might be.  </p>
