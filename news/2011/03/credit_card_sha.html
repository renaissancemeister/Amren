<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the credit card industry every week is &#8220;Shark Week.&#8221; Like a Great White shark investigating a school of financially insecure fish they know where to find the people who &#8220;need&#8221; them the most.</p>
<p>Hence the term: &#8220;predatory lending.&#8221; They know those with the weakest bank statement (if they have a bank account at all) make the best prey.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Studies show that just like the mortgage industry, the credit card business is awash in racist policies. According to Andrea Freeman, law professor at California Western School of Law and author of a 2010 study called Credit Card Ills, there are many dangers for the black community when it comes to credit.</p>
<p>Racial discrimination appears &#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the form of &#8216;redlining,&rsquo; the practice of varying credit card contract terms based on the applicant&rsquo;s zip code and other signifiers of race such as names and appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Essentially, black cardholders who carry balances on their accounts are more than twice as likely as whites to pay high interest rates.</p>
<p>So if you have a name commonly used in white communities, live in a white neighborhood and pay your bills on time, you might get a 7 percent interest rate. If you have an ethnic-sounding name, live in a black neighborhood and pay your bills on time, you might get a 17 percent interest rate.</p>
<p>Professor Freeman demonstrates that the credit card industry&rsquo;s business model is based on the poorest consumers paying the highest fees and interest rates in order to subsidize credit card use by the richest consumers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>So why would credit card companies focus on people who are already having a hard time paying bills?</p>
<p>Subsistence Users tend to carry credit card balances from month-to-month. As a result they are charged interest fees on their balances. Interest is the price you pay for the privilege of getting today what you could not afford until tomorrow.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In 2004, nearly 60 percent of African Americans had a credit card, and nearly 84 percent of them carried a month-to-month balance. This means that low- and middle-class African Americans (who tend to live check to check) are essentially a primary source of income for a multi-billion dollar credit card industry.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Institutional racism allows the financial industry to profit off of the black community. Once we understand how much race impacts our fiscal choices, we can change our behavior, take control of our collective finances and create solutions to our economic reality.<br>

		<p>Alright, Lurie Favors, Esq.  Show us how it&rsquo;s done.  Go out and start a bank and give lines of revolving credit to these obviously deserving and creditworthy black customers at the interest rates that creditworthy middle to upper middle class whites get.  You&rsquo;ll be the one &#8220;profiting off the black community,&#8221; and not some white bank.</p>
<p>And when your bank goes into Chapter 7, don&rsquo;t come cryin&rsquo; to me.</p>

		<p>No surprise here. If creditors lend Afro-Americans money then it is &#8220;institutionalized racism&#8221; and if they do not lend Afro-Americans money it is &#8220;institutionalized racism&#8221;.<br>
Furthermore, if Afro-Americans fit into a demographic that is flawed or undesirable in any way, it is whitey&rsquo;s fault.<br>
If given the choice, I&rsquo;d be &ldquo;racist&rdquo; for NOT lending Afro-Americans money.<br>

		<p>&#8220;I`d rather be racist for NOT lending African-Americans money&#8221; Anglo-American666<br>
 The first time I ever broke through the &#8220;Their problems are my problems&#8221; routine was at age 19 working in a Steakhouse. A new  Black cook had been hired that night. He cornered me and another guy in the store room and told us we needed to lend him 20 dollars  each till payday and it would  greatly grease his wheels to our benefit behind the line. For some reason, I didn`t trust him, or I  just didn`t like the shakedown, so I lied and  told him I didn`t have any.  He went &#8220;okaaay&hellip;&#8221; so convincingly the other guy paid right up.<br>
  Thiry minutes later he was missing in action and so was his car. Come to find out he had stayed at his new &#8220;job&#8221; just long enough to get twenty bucks each from twelve of the other waiters.<br>
The guy that paid up beside me announced to everybody that I DIDN`T fall for it. The murmurs of respect from my older co-workers washed over me like a warm shower. That was 1978 and I still get good feelings for making the cautious decision. <br>
 I credit it all to my Dad. He was a bleeding heart social worker but when it came to hard earned money it was every man for himself.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;predatory lending&#8221; is in itself fraudulent.  The notion that lenders somehow profit by making loans to known deadbeats is on its face absurd.</p>
<p>That people with known poor credit scores pay higher interest rates is simply a reflection of the additional risk lenders assume when extending credit to unreliable borrowers.</p>

<p>Credit Card Sharks Hunt For Black Prey<br>
 For greedy credit card companies and banks, African Americans make the best victimsBy: Lurie Favors, Esq. | theLoop21 (Add to your loop)  <br>

Credit: Stay ViolationJust count the number of (predatory) check cashing or payday lending companies in the average African American community and compare it to the number of banks.</p>
<p>So why would credit card companies focus on people who are already having a hard time paying bills?</p>
<p>Subsistence Users tend to carry credit card balances from month-to-month. As a result they are charged interest fees on their balances. Interest is the price you pay for the privilege of getting today what you could not afford until tomorrow.</p>
<p>For credit card companies, interest is the pot of gold at the end of the credit card industry&rsquo;s rainbow. High interest rates are like winning the Powerball after finding the pot of gold.</p>
<p>In 2004, nearly 60 percent of African Americans had a credit card, and nearly 84 percent of them carried a month-to-month balance. This means that low- and middle-class African Americans (who tend to live check to check) are essentially a primary source of income for a multi-billion dollar credit card industry.</p>
<p>Media master Tom Burrell notes: &ldquo;Low-income blacks&hellip;are the dominant supporters of the multi-billion dollar payday loan and rent-to-own entities that can charge triple-digit interest rates, and rent merchandise at sometimes more than 200 percent above the manufacturer&rsquo;s suggested retail price.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Institutional racism allows the financial industry to profit off of the black community. Once we understand how much race impacts our fiscal choices, we can change our behavior, take control of our collective finances and create solutions to our economic reality.</p>

		<p>So whats stopping blacks from creating their OWN crdit card companies if they feel the White companies are &#8216;racisss&rsquo;! They could have a card thats black in color, shaped like a black power fist and call it &#8216;The Race Card&rsquo;!<br>
I can just see the comercials now - a group of blacks holding up their cards and saying &#8220;the race card, I never leave home without it&#8221;!<br>
I&rsquo;m quite sure the White card companies would GLADLY transfer their balances over to the new card - without penalty!</p>

		<p>The lending discrimination myth got its major impetus from a now famous 1992 Boston Fed study.  That study has since been debunked by FOUR SEPARATE RESEARCH TEAMS.  Details:</p>
<p>1992 - July - A Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study indicates that &ldquo;even after controlling for financial, employment, and neighborhood characteristics, black and Hispanic mortgage applicants in the Boston metropolitan area are roughly 60 percent more likely to be turned down than whites.&rdquo; The study suggests racism is behind the higher loan denial rate.</p>
<p>1993 - Forbes Magazine queries Boston Fed Senior Vice President and Research Director Alicia H. Munnell on the default rates of black and white mortgage holders in the Boston Fed&rsquo;s 1992 study purporting to show that racism is behind the higher loan denial rate for blacks.  The reporters learn that default rates on loans of whites and minorities are equal. This indicates no discrimination, they point out to Munnell.  &ldquo;[That] is a sophisticated point,&rdquo; she replies. &ldquo;You need that [lower default rates for blacks] as a confirming piece of evidence. And we don&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forbes: Did you ever ask the question that if defaults appear to be more or less the same among blacks and whites, that points to mortgage lenders making rational decisions?</p>
<p>Munnell: No &hellip; I do believe that discrimination occurs.</p>
<p>Forbes: You have no evidence?</p>
<p>Munnell: I do not have evidence &hellip; No one has evidence. (1)</p>
<p>1996 - A study by the  Federal Reserve System and academic specialists finds  &mdash;  like the 1993 Forbes investigation  &mdash;  no evidence &ldquo;of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&rdquo; Quoting from the abstract of the study:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Results of the analysis fail to find evidence of better performance on loans granted to minority borrowers. Indeed, black borrowers are found, all else being equal, to exhibit a higher likelihood of mortgage default than other borrowers. These findings argue against allegations of substantial levels of bias in mortgage lending.&rdquo; </p>
<p>1998 - October - Economists Stan L. Liebowitz and Theodore Day investigate the 1992 Boston Fed study suggesting racism in the mortgage market. They are &ldquo;shocked at the poor quality&rdquo; of the the data: </p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;When we attempted to conduct a statistical analysis removing the impact of &hellip; obvious data errors, we found that the evidence of discrimination vanished. Without discrimination there would be no reason to try to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; the mortgage market. Nevertheless, our work largely evaporated down the memory hole as government regulators got busy putting the results of the Boston Fed study to use in creating policy. That policy, simply put, was to weaken underwriting standards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two economists warn: Bad loans today will mean dispossessed minorities tomorrow: </p>
<p>&ldquo;After the warm and fuzzy glow of &lsquo;flexible underwriting standards&rsquo; has worn off, we may discover that they are nothing more than standards that led to bad loans &hellip; If this is the case, current policy will not have helped its intended beneficiaries if in future years they are dispossessed from their homes due to an inability to make their mortgage payments.&rdquo; (2)</p>
<p>1999 - Finance  professors at the University of Illinois and at Wichita State University disclose findings on the creditworthiness of minorities consistent with the 1993 Forbes report, the 1996 Federal Reserve study cited earlier, and the 1998 findings of Liebowitz and Day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[E]verything else being the same, minority applicants are probably less creditworthy, on average, than whites. Therefore, in the absence of fair lending laws, it is likely that minorities would be denied loans more frequently than whites and would pay higher interest rates and fees on approved loans &hellip;  [F]air-lending laws have the perverse effect of forcing lenders to cross-subsidize minority borrowers from the higher profits they earn on white borrowers. Such cross-subsidization is inherently &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; because it works as a tax on one group that is used as a subsidy for another.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>Why is it so hard to accept the idea of predatory lending?</p>
<p>The banks lend to poor people because the fees and interest charges more than make up for any losses (and in the unlikely event that there are losses, the gubmint will raid our pockets to make the banks whole).</p>
<p>Some of the tricks used by banks that led to the housing crash are blatantly criminal (how many of these people have been sent to jail so far???).</p>
<p>Providian bank (sub-prime credit cards) was caught a few years ago holding payments until after the due dates in order to add late charges&hellip; I don&rsquo;t recall the bank president being led out in handcuffs.</p>

		<p>Simple cure, don&rsquo;t provide credit to anyone with too low a credit score AND when black card holders reach 12.5% of the total number of card holders (the same percentage as they are in the general population), then no more cards are offered to that group.  Its the only logical way to address the issues Andrea Freeman is concerned about.  For extra safety, make those wh desire a credit card take a test to assure they have fundamental debt-related competencies.</p>

		<p>This professor has not concept of the business models or basic economics that drive the credit industry.  If the law and poltical pressure didn&rsquo;t force the card companies to be more liberal with their polices, they wouldn&rsquo;t lend to many on the lower tier.  But then that would be called discriminatory and institutional racism.  So credit is provided, and in a democracy we allow individuals to run amuck with their cards.  They can buy anything they want, and nary a care how to re-pay it.  But if they can&rsquo; pay how is the credit card compensated?  Well they charge higher rates to those in that category who can pay.  It is the poor credits that make up for the dead beats.  <br>

		<p>To all the black people reading this:  Here&rsquo;s how to avoid being taken advantage of by racist, predatory credit card issuers:</p>
<p>1.  Only buy what you can afford.</p>
<p>2.  Pay off your credit card bill in full every month.</p>
<p>When you do this it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the interest rate is.  That&rsquo;s what I do, and frankly I don&rsquo;t even know what the interest rates are on my credit cards.<br>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t quite understand. Are blacks forced to sign up for lousy credit card deals or carry balances forward for stuff they shouldn&rsquo;t be buying, or can&rsquo;t afford, in the first place?</p>
<p>This is another abdication by blacks of responsibility and a public admission of black stupidity.</p>
<p>First, blacks are a higher risk when it comes to lending. You hardly need to be a genius to figure that out. So of course the credit terms will be somewhat harsh. </p>
<p>What the article implies is that blacks, because they are black, and marginally employed, and poor, and not so bright, should be given lots of credit at low interest rates and not have to pay it back because they are black, marginally employed, poor, and not so bright.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if blacks see white people with credit cards so of course, they want credit cards, not understanding how the system works. Like building good credit and watching your spending.</p>
<p>These types of articles make me sick. Yes, predatory lending can be ugly, and a problem, but only if you repeatedly allow yourself to fall prey.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately there are a few grains of truth in the piece. Setting rates, and pitching offers by zip code IS in practice at many banks.  Its there because they can&rsquo;t use race directly as a consideration. </p>
<p>However, for someone like me who used to live in a 63134 &hellip; It was quite a penalty to pay. The area I lived in was majority white, and lower-middle class. 63134 also encompassed parts of two majority black areas that had horrible crime rates, and every other problem typical of black communities. </p>
<p>Not only did banks redline the area for business loans   &mdash;   which killed the white area just as effectively as black moving in would have, it raised the home owners, car, boat, and other insurance rates. It also made some companies offer higher interest rate cards than they did in neighboring zip codes (with roughly the same income levels) that did not share a large black or hispanic population. </p>
<p>Eventually the banks did something else with it &hellip;they started targeting my former zip code, and the ones surrounding it for lending to hispanics. Even going as far as advertising in Mexico suggesting they would make home loans in these zip codes more freely. </p>

		<p>Credit card companies are in the business to make money by getting back more than they lend.  Otherwise they wouldn&rsquo;t be in the business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been offered to borrow money through credit card companies, yet unlike the dull and poor, don&rsquo;t borrow money I can&rsquo;t repay to buy a FUBU jumpsuit I don&rsquo;t really need.</p>
<p>But yeah, it&rsquo;s the racist credit card companies fault some ethnicities are more prone to be dull and poor.</p>

		<p>The simple and obvious point is that no one needs to buy on credit unless they choose to do so and the logical corollary of that, in the final analysis a credit purchase will always cost more than saving up and paying cash.<br>
  But for some reason freedom of choice is deemed &#8216;racist&rsquo; if blacks don&rsquo;t come up winning on it.</p>

		<p>Looking at these &#8216;risk versus interest rates&rsquo; figures, I don&rsquo;t see any real difference between USA and UK credit cards. In UK, there are many complaints about the financial services industry and how it affects low-income households, mainly White (as the majority population) and I have not seen adverse comments concerning race. However, if there are are very large number of USA blacks who fall into the high interest category when compared to White cardholders, then percentages and ratios would appear to skew figures as in this story.  BTW, 17% is not high as cards in UK can charge well over 20%, nearing 30%. This is an excellent opportunity for the SPLC and NAACP et al to step in and set up a black credit card banking service. However, this will never happen as they know their membership only too well. Even these racist groups know about risk management.</p>

		<p>a good credit rating brings a lower interest rate for the card holder and vice-versa. The card companies are mitigating their risk by applying that simple formula. Nothing racist about that and it is likely many whites are poor risks also. Some simple advice is to cut the card in half if the holder is spending too much. </p>

		<p>Nobody twisted these people&rsquo;s arm and forced them to get credit cards or sign on home or car loans. It is a function of not wanting to live within your means and having to pay a high price- a lesson I had to learn the hard way. If someone cannot maintain a bank account then they do not deserve credit- period. A bank account that is kept solvent is a sign of responsibility and unfortunately many people do not see that. I had a white coworker who was offered a 200,000 mortgage with both incomes not exceeding 10.00 an hour! This was during the height of the &#8220;housing bubble&#8221; and he admitted that he and his wife had trouble with banks and had two accounts that were so overdrawn that they had not been able to pay and had abandoned them. One Monday morning he came in all excited that they had signed up for the gym- on the platinum package! This is not responsibility and it drives prices and interest rates up for all of us.</p>

<p>Another Schadenfreude moment!</p>
<p>Well, Lurie, how about publishing the average black credit rating as compared to the average white credit rating?  Maybe then we can get a more accurate picture as to why credit card companies might be, well, a tad bit suspicious of lending to blacks?</p>
<p>If you were doing your job as a journalist, Lurie, you would have included the following, which took me about 90 seconds to find via a Google search:</p>
<p><i>When calculated on a 100-point scale, the average credit score for African Americans is about half of the average for whites.</i></p>
<p>How about explaining to us why every other business in the black community is a check cashing/payday advance business (the other being fish joints: You Bring it, We Fry It! No Questions Asked! (or is it Axed?).</p>
<p>Credit card companies are not charity! Even though this is a widely-held belief preached in the black community.</p>
<p>Face it!  Blacks have no ability to handle such complicated financial issues as credit. That&rsquo;s for chumps.  Any cash money or &#8220;free&#8221; money, like a credit card or payroll advance will be immediately used for such essential items as grillz, rimz, $300 basketball shoes, ghetto bling and outings to the local casino.  Everyone knows this!</p>
<p>And, I, Schadenfreude, will be laughing all the way to the&hellip;.with my 800 credit score.</p>
<p>Yeah, Credit, Baby.   Getting it must be a white thang.</p>

		<p>Here in the Indianapolis area, there is a station that is a talk radio only format. In the 12- 3 slot, they have Dave Ramsey (who competes with Rush Limbaugh) during that time. The vast majority of his callers are white (or at least sound that way). I haven&rsquo;t heard a caller named DeMarcus or Lucrecia (granted I don&rsquo;t have the opportunity to listen religiously). The few black callers I have heard tend to get nothing but incessant criticism from their peers. If they do survive and pay off their bills, then everyone is lined up at their door wanting to borrow money. These people are viewed as ATM&rsquo;s (often under duress). </p>
<p>The last time I checked, Ebay and Craigslist do not ask you if you are a minority when you look at an item. That or just walk into H.H. Gregg (a regional appliance store headquartered in Indianapolis) Sears or Best Buy with cash in hand. Oh yea, silly me, &#8220;I gots to have my new 56 inch big screen TV&#8221;. &#8220;My 1995 Buick gots to have 22 inch rims.&#8221; </p>
<p>You have some of the rent to own, check cashing, and &#8220;Buy here, Pay here&#8221; places in the outlying areas, but they are much more heavily concentrated inside of I-465.  </p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s strange is that there is a lot of &#8220;civil rights&#8221; complaining about banks and the high interest rates they levy on revolving credit accounts for black customers, yet there isn&rsquo;t quite as much whining from the civil rights industry about rent-to-own joints.</p>
<p>I once did some TVM calculations, and just based on the RTO business&rsquo;s sticker price for merchandise, and what they were asking for weekly or monthly payments, they were charging interest rates between 70 and 300 percent.  And that&rsquo;s only half the story, because their sticker prices are inflated as it is because the merchandise they sell is at least a few model years or seasons old, ergo the sticker price should be less than what it was when it was new.  So adding that in, the interest rate is effectively even higher.</p>

		<p>How poorly written is this piece?  </p>
<p>&#8220;For the credit card industry every week is &ldquo;Shark Week.&rdquo; Like a Great White shark investigating a school of financially insecure fish they know where to find the people who &ldquo;need&rdquo; them the most.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you for capitalizing &#8220;Great White&#8221; - was this an unintentional double entendre? Or, do you make it a point to capitalize common nouns?  If it is a double entendre, why not throw some color on the fish?</p>
<p>In your opening sentence, I would also like to feverishly applaud your grammatical ability.  I mean really - why use a comma to separate a dependent clause from an independent clause?  </p>
<p>Do great white sharks investigate?  Your verb choice is amazing and accurate. </p>
<p>What type of fish is saying to himself, &#8220;Man, I really need to find a shark.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Your logic is as flawed as your politics, ideology, and writing skills.  </p>
<p>Thank you Mrs. ESQ.</p>

		<p>As I&rsquo;ve posted before, I worked for a black-run company. The CEO had degrees from elite colleges, drove a Mercedes, had a house in a great neighborhood. </p>
<p>Yet just about every vendor got stiffed on bills, often to the tune of six-figures. No one from the company would even bother to contest creditors in court. It was truly bizarre. </p>
<p>Turns out the guy running the company had been doing this for more than a decade. </p>
<p>Then I found out about the allegations of rape, and six-figure settlements. That&rsquo;s when I left (and then I heard even weirder stuff). <br>

		<p>It is a pure &#8220;we&rsquo;re damned&#8221; scenario, the minorities demand what they cannot fairly attain, and still reserve the &#8220;civil&#8221; right to call us racist as we hand over whatever they want this time. Everyone knows they would fail on their own, this neverending cycle of crying victim is their real job: getting new prizes in their annual racist witch hunt as collecting reparations and getting white guild pushed ever further. <br>
We are obligated to give them free money and bend over and happily take the &#8220;racist&#8221; taunts. The only way out is for all whites to quit our jobs and form a breakaway society in the states with the most whites.</p>
