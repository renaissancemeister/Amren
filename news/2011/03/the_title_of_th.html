<h1>&#8220;Straight Talk on the Airways&#8221;? Not Any More</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Edward Bernays, VDARE, March 30, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The title of this article is taken from
					<a href="#cover">a 
					1999 cover story</a> in Jared Taylor&rsquo;s
					<a href="/ar/1999/01/index.html">
					<i style="">American Renaissance</i></a> 
					about talk radio. The main point of the article: talk radio 
					had emerged as one of the few places where Americans could 
					freely discuss racial issues.
					<i style="">AR</i> noted:</p>
					<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
					<span style="">&nbsp;</span><b style="">&#8220;In 
					a </b>
					<b>culture dominated by liberal assumptions,&nbsp;A</b><b style="">mericans have to look hard for the truth about race and immigration. 
					They can find it on the Internet, on some cable-access 
					channels, occasionally on C-Span, and sometimes on talk 
					radio. Of these, radio is by far the most popular medium and 
					has the greatest impact.&#8221;</b></p>
					<p>In what would be unthinkable today, 
					seven of the most popular talk radio hosts of the 
					time  &mdash;  Michael Reagan,
					Larry Elder,
					David 
					Brudnoy, Bob Grant,
					Michael 
					Medved,
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Hamblin">Ken 
					Hamblin</a> and
					Al 
					Rantel  &mdash;  all gave interviews to
					<i style="">AR</i> and candidly 
					discussed their views on affirmative action, immigration, 
					race and IQ, whites becoming a minority and other racial 
					issues. Not only did these mainstream hosts  &mdash;  including two 
					blacks  &mdash;  give
					<a href="/interviews/index.html">
					interviews to <i style="">AR</i>,</a> 
					they also gave answers that would likely get them fired.
					<i style="">AR</i> editor
					Jared Taylor 
					had been a regular guest on some of these programs and at 
					least one host  &mdash;  Brudnoy  &mdash;  was a subscriber to the publication, 
					and reviewed Taylor&rsquo;s book
					<i style="">Paved With Good Intentions</i>
					favorably in
					<i style="">Human Events.</i></p>
					<p>In fact, Jared Taylor was a regular on 
					talk radio throughout the 1990s. He even appeared on 
					national TV shows such as
					<a href="/interviews/2003/0210donahue/transcript.html">
					Donahue</a>,
					<a href="/interviews/2004/0106scarborough/index.html">
					Scarborough Country</a>, Hardball with Chris Matthews and 
					other popular programs. C-SPAN broadcast at least two of
					<i style="">AR&rsquo;s</i> bi-annual 
					conferences and also two press conferences where Taylor was a speaker.
					<i style="">AR</i>&rsquo;s <a href="#cover">
					groundbreaking</a> <i style="">
					Color of Crime</i> (<a href="https://archive.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime1999.html">1999</a>) 
					[<a href="/colorofcrime1999.pdf">PDF</a>]report 
					was actually discussed on the Rush Limbaugh Show (though not 
					by Limbaugh: even more impressive, black guest host
					<a href="https://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=21982">
					Walter Williams summarized the report favorably</a> to 
					Limbaugh&rsquo;s 20 million listeners).</p>
					<p>Discussions of
					<i style="">The Color of Crime </i>
					were such a hit on talk radio that in several cities, the 
					producers heard 
						Taylor
						talking about the report on a competing station and 
					called to book him on their own programs. A press conference 
					at the National Press Club to discuss the report was widely 
					attended and resulted in a
					<a href="/interviews/1999/0602color-of-crime/index.html">
					CSPAN broadcast</a> and national print coverage. </p>
					<p><span style="">&nbsp;</span>For 
					many Americans, occasions such as this were the first time 
					they heard someone arguing for the
					interests of whites as a group. Responses to
					<i style="">American Renaissance</i> 
					from interested listeners were in the thousands and the 
					magazine netted many new
					<a href="https://store.amren.com/cart.php?target=category&amp;category_id=86">
					subscribers</a> from these debates and appearances.</p>
					<p>Heading into the new millennium, the 
					media appearances slowed a bit. But they really came to a 
					halt around
					2004. 
					The change was dramatically apparent by 2005, when an
					update of
					<a href="https://archive.colorofcrime.com/colorofcrime1999.html">
					Color of Crime</a> provoked
					only 
					a few radio interviews. </p>
					<p>Taylor told me recently: </p>
					<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
					<span style="">&nbsp;</span><b style="">&#8220;The 
					irony is that media appearances dried up just as listeners 
					were becoming much more interested and sympathetic. In the 
					early 1990s, callers would rage at me just for talking about 
					the </b>
					<b style="">unfairness of racial 
					preferences</b><b style="">. 
					Ten years later, after a discussion of what is at risk if 
					the country turns majority non-white, listeners would 
					surprise even the most conservative hosts by calling to say, 
					&#8216;I agree with everything Mr. Taylor has said.&rsquo; Is it a 
					coincidence that the megaphone is being taken away just as 
					the audience starts to get the message?&#8221;</b></p>
					<p>Peter Brimelow, who unlike Taylor was 
					an established MSM journalist when he
					began 
					writing about immigration in 1992, and who
					was considerably in demand after the publication of his
					<i style="">Alien Nation</i> 
					in 1995, also reports that media invitations abruptly ceased 
					around 2004. Brimelow believes, partly because of his study 
					of the
					evolving War Against Christmas, that there is
					co-ordinated 
					systematic blacklisting  &mdash;  facilitated, ironically, by the 
					internet.</p>
					<p>In 2008,
					<i style="">American Renaissance</i> 
					attempted to revive media interest in racial issues with a 
					campaign of pitches. Numerous media advisories were sent to 
					a talk radio/TV list of 500 producers and hosts from around 
					the U.S. This list included national 
					shows as well as smaller regional and local programs but 
					takers were few. Several pitches resulted in zero 
					interviews.</p>
					<p>Around the same time, VDARE.com 
					initiated a small media relations program that included 
					weekly talk radio pitches. Unlike
					<i style="">AR</i>, VDARE.com does 
					not explicitly defend white interests, focusing instead on
					broader American interests. Moreover, the website sticks 
					primarily to
					immigration-related issues as opposed to topics such as 
					IQ, black-on-white crime and other taboo subjects. This does 
					not stop
					Media Matters, the
					$PLC 
					and other
					well-funded witch-hunters from
					labeling 
					VDARE a white supremacist site. But it did make it somewhat 
					easier for Peter Brimelow and the writers of VDARE to land 
					more radio interviews than Taylor.</p>
					<p>From 2008-2010, VDARE.com writers were 
					occasionally featured on nationally syndicated shows such as 
					The Lars Larson Show,
					<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnI=1&amp;sourceid=deskbar&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+The+Curtis+Sliwa+Show+">
					The Curtis Sliwa Show</a> andÂ­  &mdash;  before the host apparently
					changed sides on immigration  &mdash;  The 
					Lou Dobbs Show. VDARE.com columnists also appeared on 
					bigger local shows such as
					<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnI=1&amp;sourceid=deskbar&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+The+Ron+Smith+Show+">
					The Ron Smith Show</a> in Baltimore, The Mike McConnell Show 
					in Cincinnati
						and the
					<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnI=1&amp;sourceid=deskbar&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+Radio+Free+Rocky+D+">
					Radio Free Rocky D</a> program in 
						Charleston. (By far the most 
					open-minded:
					<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;btnI=1&amp;sourceid=deskbar&amp;q=site%3Avdare.com+Talkback+with+Chuck+Wilder+">
					Talkback with Chuck Wilder</a> on the
					<a href="https://talkbackwithchuckwilder.blogspot.com/">CRN 
					Radio network.</a>) </p>
					<p>But despite this modest success, most 
					pitches only netted 2-3 interviews on smaller stations, in 
					contrast to Taylor in the 1990s. (The VDARE.com PR program 
					was suspended in 2010 because a
					key 
					donor reneged on its annual grant). </p>
					<p>So how did open discussion of racial 
					and immigration issues go from being relatively acceptable 
					in 1999 to being forbidden only a decade later?</p>
					<p>Time has played some role. Looking at 
					the seven established hosts interviewed in the AR article, 
					three are now retired (Rantel, Grant and Hamblin) and one is 
					dead (Brudnoy). 
					Younger hosts coming into the business apparently feel their
					careers 
					will be in jeopardy if they violate
					racial taboos.</p>
					<p>There is some speculation that
					<a href="https://online.wsj.com/article/SB121504302144124805.html">
					corporate consolidation</a> in the talk radio industry has 
					led to fewer outlets and more Politically Correct
					centralized control of guest lists. </p>
					<p>But the overwhelming reason: PC taboos 
					have
					simply grown more intense  &mdash;  and better organized  &mdash;  over the 
					past decade.
					Black 
					crime and the
					<a href="https://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc0504/article_462.shtml">
					racial aspects of immigration</a> were certainly 
					controversial issues in the 1990s, but they were not 
					proscribed like they are now.</p>
					<p>It is not just talk radio that is less 
					open to debating racial issues. In the 1990s, major 
					publishing houses released books such as
					<a href="/store/paved_with_good.html">
					<i style="">Paved With Good Intentions</i></a>,
					<i style="">The Bell Curve</i>, 
					<i style="">Alien Nation</i>,
					<i style="">The End of Racism</i>,&nbsp;<i>Hating 
					Whitey<img alt="" src="/e/ir_t_vdare_l_ur2_o_1.gif" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" height="1" /></i> 
					and other books that challenged racial orthodoxy. None of 
					these books would be touched by a major publishing house 
					today. In fact, Taylor has been shopping around a sequel to
					<i style="">Paved With Good 
					Intentions</i> to publishers big and small for several years 
					with no takers  &mdash;  despite his first book&rsquo;s commercial success. 
					(<i style="">AR&rsquo;</i>s New Century 
					Foundation will publish the book soon, with the title
					<i style="">White Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century</i>.)</p>
					<p>Another sign of the times: the
					<i style="">American Renaissance</i> conference, last held in 2008 has been scuttled 
					for two straight years now after hotels backed out of 
					contracts due to
					political pressure and
					death threats  &mdash;  which the law enforcement authorities were 
					unable/ unwilling to counter. While
					<i style="">AR </i>events
					always attracted protesters, they previously went off 
					without incident and
					attracted a fair amount of press coverage. In 
					significant contrast, no Main Stream Media outlets even 
					reported the suppression of AR&rsquo;s conferences in 2010 and 
					2011.</p>
					<p>The 1999 AR talk radio piece ended with 
					the following in regard to the seven radio hosts 
					interviewed: </p>
					<p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
					<b style="">&#8220;Though they have different views of the importance of race, they are 
					refreshingly open to discussing it. It is men like these who 
					help talk radio chip away at the rigid liberalism that has 
					for so long set the boundaries of acceptable discourse.&#8221;</b></p>
					<p>Some talk radio hosts still talk about
					<i style="">illegal</i> immigration (as they will at
					FAIR&rsquo;s upcoming Feet to The Fire radio fest  &mdash;  possibly 
					explaining why FAIR itself no longer talks much about 
					reducing legal immigration). They will occasionally gripe 
					about racial double standards. But talk radio is no longer
					<b style="">&#8220;chipping away&#8221;</b> 
					at liberalism with regard to race, immigration and America&rsquo;s changing demographics.</p>
					<p>What this means is that the internet is 
					now the last bastion of straight talk on race, 
					demography  &mdash;  and America&rsquo;s future. </p>
					<p>Sites like VDARE.com, American 
					Renaissance now have a greater readership than ever, in part 
					exactly because talk radio no longer discusses their issues. 
					Newer websites and blogs such as Alternative Right, View 
					from the Right, Half Sigma, Nicholas Stix, Uncensored, 
					Mangan&rsquo;s and many others freely discuss and debate the 
					latest racial controversies, research and issues on a daily 
					basis. Podcasting and streaming video mean that the 
					electronic MSM faces technological as well as intellectual 
					obsolescence  &mdash;  exactly as has already happened to the print 
					MSM.</p>
					<p>Of course, this means that leftist thug 
					groups like Media Matters and the Southern Poverty Law 
					Center ($PLC to VDARE.com) would like nothing better than to 
					shut down websites they don&rsquo;t agree with. VDARE.com is 
					likely at or near the top of their list. Given the racial 
					loyalties of our current president and Attorney General, we 
					can be sure censorship of &#8220;hate speech&#8221; websites would have 
					strong support in high places.</p>
					<p>Hopefully, in a decade&rsquo;s time, we will 
					not look back at today and marvel that websites like 
					VDARE.com could freely criticize the demographic 
					displacement of whites and AR could openly discuss 
					black-on-white crime.</p>

- Edward Bernays, VDARE, March 30, 2011<br>
 <br>
  &mdash;    &mdash;  -<br>
 <br>
The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution, written by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending, was published in 2009. It thoroughly refutes Steven J. Gould&rsquo;s preposterous assertion that human evolution stopped 50,000 years ago. <br>
 <br>
Steven J. Gould is often cited as one who has &#8220;thoroughly refuted&#8221; The Bell Curve, by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray. The 10,000 Explosion exposes Steven J. Gould as an ideologue whose emotions determined his reality perceptions. It also serves as a supplement to The Bell Curve by explaining how the racial differences detailed in The Bell Curve evolved.<br>
 <br>
A review of The 10,000 Year Explosion can be found here:<br>
<a href="/ar/2009/05/index.html" rel="nofollow">/ar/2009/05/index.html</a><br>
 <br>
Click on the link, and scroll halfway down. The 10,000 Year explosion is even more devastating to the dogmas of racial egalitarianism than The Bell Curve because it is easier to read. The fact that The 10,000 Year Explosion has not encountered the invective thrown at The Bell Curve suggests to me that the public is becoming more, rather than less, willing to consider biological reasons for racial differences.  <br>
 <br>
When it becomes more obvious that No Child Left Behind has failed, and how it is failed, these differences will be even harder to deny. <br>
 <br>
It is worth mentioning that Charles Murray has an easy time getting his articles published in The Wall Street Journal, Commentary, and even The Washington Post. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed the local paper here has become more liberal since Obama&rsquo;s election. They&rsquo;re just doing their part in our democracy. Not the paper was very conservative when Bush was in charge, but perhaps a bit less liberal. One commentator noted, of the New York Times during the 1990s, &#8220;they went from being the liberal but fair paper of record to being a politically correct parody of their former selves&#8221;. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, I thought there was still free speech in America.  Just kidding, I know there hasn&rsquo;t been for years.</p>

<p>This is what the Leftists and minorities are afraid of.  I myself did not know about this website until I found it once by accident.  If Amren was mainstream it would be HUGE.  That is why there will never be a government backed NAAWP, WET, etc.  Too many white people would agree with it and the brain washing would stop.  God forbid patriotic white Americans have something to connect them all.</p>

		<p>The purpose of talk radio is to keep disaffected whites away from white nationalism.  The job of people like Rush Limbaugh is to tell just enough of the truth to make people believe he is on their side, then steer them into supporting anti-white establishment political hacks.</p>
<p>Charles Murray is very far from being pro-white in any sense.  Recognizing racial differences doesn&rsquo;t make one a white nationalist.  The internet is now full of &#8220;race realists&#8221; who are indifferent or hostile to white survival.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been saying this for years. American Renaissance should be producing their OWN video and audio interviews and posting on this website, youtube, and others.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the beautify of the internet. It by-passes the mainstream filters.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor should be doing weekly skype-type interviews. TAYLOR picks the guest. TAYLOR picks the topic. TAYLOR asks the questions. No filters. No holds barred.</p>
<p>These videos should flood the internet. I suspect, some might even go viral.</p>
<p>The future is here and the future is internet video.</p>
<p>Use it or stagnate with a small readership.</p>

		<p>I have noticed that the subject of race is becoming more and more taboo, unless it&rsquo;s front-and-center pro-black.  I assumed it was because we&rsquo;ve got a half&half-er; in the White House along with his mixed bag of cronies, appointees, and supporters.  But I also believe there is definitely something more sinister behind it; I&rsquo;d bet a lot of money I don&rsquo;t have that its name is George Soros and that his function is to pay off a whole lot of people and corporations to keep their mouths shut with regard to race or related political topics.  Did anyone notice that the black Rev. in NY who calls Obama the &#8220;long-legged mac daddy&#8221; was shut down for several months, and the video he made that once accused Obama of having a homosexual relationship with a man named Larry Sinclair - has been cut?  Along, regrettably, with the good Rev.&rsquo;s song about same - that alone was worth hearing.  I played it for my 92 year old mother and she was delighted, as well as astounded.  Ergo, friends, SOMEBODY Out There is paying a LOT of money to have a ton of people silenced.  The Rev. in NY is a real good example, since he and his congregation are BLACK - so it isn&rsquo;t just race that dictates who gets shut down.  Nope.  Our President has VERY long arms, and there&rsquo;s MONEY at the end of those arms, and that money will accomplish a simple shut-down or a real threat of harm to anyone who rocks the racial or Presidential boat.  Be aware, folks!!</p>

		<p>Two things have changed of late.  Nearly everyone is connected to the internet now, and the economy is dependant more than ever on continued mass immigration.</p>
<p>The power of the first scares the heck out of public figures.  Anything they say can come back to haunt them.</p>
<p>An end to mass immigration would bring an end to massive lending. This would bring increases in the money supply to a screeching halt, including the ability of the U.S. government to make payments to bondholders.</p>

The purpose of talk radio is to win the support of disaffected whites, and to induce them to support economic policies that make the rich richer, even at the expense of those disaffected whites. Rush Limbaugh&rsquo;s support for NAFTA is only the most obvious example of this. <br>
 <br>
Rush Limbaugh is a shill for the corporate establishment. The corporate establishment wants more immigrants so that it can raise prices and cut wages. </p>

		<p>For the record, Phil Donahue&rsquo;s MSNBC show was cancelled not because he had Jared Taylor on twice-back-to-back shows. Phil Donahue&rsquo;s MSNBC show was cancelled because he was a very publicly opposed to the invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>Here is the larger point. The MSM is on board with Bush-Clinton-Obama perpetual war policy. These wars are being sold to the American people as &#8220;noble&#8221; causes because of our &#8220;noble intentions&#8221;:&#8221;We are liberators, not conquerers&#8221;. Now any adult with a functioning brain nows that this is all a bold-face lie. But the ideology of post-1965 immigration policy-the blessings of diversity nonesense-is part of the ideology of the &#8220;noble&#8221; intent of Bush-Clinton-Obama foreign policy&hellip;&#8221;see how noble our intent is,why we are even willing to race-replace the evil White Americans at home&#8221;. So, in addition to providing &#8220;strong&#8221; evidence of the &#8220;noble&#8221; intentions of Republican and Democratic Parties, the corporate owners of these two parties get access to lots of foriegn scab labor and warm bodies for the military&hellip;that&rsquo;s quite a racket I must say.</p>
<p>Having Jared Taylor on th MSM to talk about the harmfull consequences-for White Americans-of post-1965 nonwhite immigration policy would expose the ideology of the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of post-1965 diversity for what it really is thereby risking the very real possibility of a Native Born White American revolt against post-1965 immigration policy. But if Native Born White Ameicans revolt against post-1965 immigration policy and the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diversity that comes with it, there is a very high probability that Native Born White Americans will also revolt against a foreign policy that is justified by by its noble intentions of promoting the &#8220;blessings&#8221; of diverstiy abroad. In fact, this is precisely  the justification that General Wesley Clark gave for the bombing of the Serbian civilian population during by Bill and Hillary Clinton years. It is not a coincidence that Hillarly Clinton is using the same justification for bombing Libya and several other Muslim nations.  This is why Jared Taylor is receiving no more invitations to speak to his fellow White Americans through the MSM.</p>

		<p>There&rsquo;s a story about how an Argentine patriot who escaped the dictatorship of Rosas in the early 19th century, Sarmiento, wrote on a boulder as he crossed over the Andes into Chile, &#8220;No se puede matar las ideas&#8221; (You can&rsquo;t kill ideas).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, given the control the present establishment has over what people are allowed to think and debate, I don&rsquo;t think this is entirely true. As we see, ideas can be supressed and &#8220;quarantined,&#8221; which is what is going on with truths regarding racial matters.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t think things are going to turn around until we have a mass awakening of young people of European background who will, like the Hippie movement of the 1960&rsquo;s, &#8220;tune in and drop out.&#8221; (I&rsquo;m intentionally leaving off the &#8220;turn on&#8221; because that will keep anyone from seeing what is really happening)</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that a person who posts on this site in support of the racial truths put forth in &#8220;The Bell Curve&#8221; and numerous other books and investigations has essentially &#8220;dropped out&#8221; of polite, &#8220;respectable&#8221; society and will either have to &#8220;walk in the shadows&#8221;, cover up their true beliefs in order to survive in a job like teaching - as I had to do for all of my career - or face the economic consequences of not being able to have a middle class income.</p>
<p>On the other hand young people, once they latch onto certain truths, have the rebelliousness and abandon of youth, and will not be constrained to conform to a lying and corrupt system as now exists. For this reason, only the newest generations at this point are the hope for the changes that will have to occur.<br>
&#8220;Revolution begins in the hearts and minds of the people&#8221; - let&rsquo;s hope that it will get sparked in them soon.</p>

<p>AMEN!  Their purpose is to also to ridicule,demonize WN&rsquo;s and NEVER talk about nonwhite crimes against Whites. Have you noticed that ALL these talk show hosts have blacks on their staffs and are &#8220;friends&#8221; of theirs?  Rush even had many blacks at his wedding (not sure,but I think the one performing the wedding was black), I do know his wife demanded that Elton John (the homosexual) be the main entertainment.

		<p>The reason for the 2000&rsquo;s blackout is precisely because anecdotal public opinion is starting to turn in favor of race reality. High IQ, post-modern liberals understand that calm and intelligent discussions posing quantifiable positions on inherent racial differences are their ruin. Silencing is their only strategy by making such topic beyond the pale.    </p>
<p>Any information that dispels this fantasy threatens their entire house of cards. Once that house of cards is toppled, egalitarian principles will no longer be used to stifle Western man. I suspect they are burying this debate until these anti-white principles can be enforced through the brute force of invading non-white populations. </p>
<p>In the late 1990&rsquo;s, cutting edge research on evolutionary biology/psychology was in much of the same predicament. While still controversial, so much of that research has proven accurate and it is slowly gaining momentum on it&rsquo;s own merit.<br>

<p>Folks, these are clear markers that resources are scarce. In a few years we&rsquo;ll not have these things at all. True, they ARE wasteful, but would it not that there are OVER 310 MILLION people in this once bountiful nation, all the talk of wasting plastic would be a joke. As for the reality, the present, you might as well dump your cigarettes on the road, and recycle nothing.

<p>I hope I am wrong about Paul Craig Roberts. Unfortunately, I do not think I am. I read Paul Craig Roberts&rsquo; commentary very carefully. He no longer writes about the very harmful consequences of post-1965 immigration policy. At best, PCR makes a few bleats about outsourcing. He has jumped ship&hellip;.and, if I had to make a prediction about where he is rapidly swimming to, I would say he is vectoring towards the shoreline of the nation of race-replacement. The demographic shift in Texas-terrible in itself-goes hand-in-hand with a massive transfer of wealth from millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans to the greedy,cheating White elites. Roberts is well aware of this..but he won&rsquo;t write about it.  Instead, we get a sermon from the  Mount speech in his vdare.com post yesterday about the poor Mexicans coming to America for a better life. Paul Craig Roberts will make it to the shoreline of the nation of race-replacement very soon where he will get a  friendly greeting from Alexander Cockburn. Expect open race-treason from PCR sometime in the near future.</p>

<p>Been there done that.  Eventually, you, like me, will swear off almost all lamestream conservative blogs.</p>
<p>One of the few I bother with anymore is Mark Levin, (I follow him on Twitter), and I&rsquo;m this close to unfollowing him.  There&rsquo;s currently a big food fight between he and someone in New Jersey named Paul Mulshine, who has the audacity (more like the courage) to tell some inconvenient truths about certain well known figures in the arena of lamestream conservatism, how they&rsquo;re really not that &#8220;conservative&#8221; at all, more interested in making money than advancing a cause.  You know how that goes   &mdash;   They came to do good and wound up doing very well indeed.  Now, Mulshine&rsquo;s columns (in a mainstream NJ paper, I think the Newark Star-Ledger) have a few errors, both in fact and in logic, but his points are mostly right on.  But Mark Levin has ripped Mulshine a new one, accusing him of being a &#8220;neo-Confederate,&#8221; (ironically, Levin lives in Virginia, and swoons over the VA politicians like Bob McDonnell and Ken Cuccinnelli who are advancing state interposition over ObamaCare), and other supposedly nasty things.</p>

Social conservatives oppose abortion, dislike birth control, and favor large families.<br>

Economic conservatives agree with me that population growth favors those who gain their incomes from property ownership at the expense of those who work for a living. They disagree that this is a problem.<br>

Liberals are supportive of birth control and abortion. Nevertheless, they suspect that those who complain that there are too many people in the world are really complaining that too many are the wrong kind of people. </p>

<p>I post about nonwhite generated population growth within the borders of America on this website quite often. I&rsquo;ve been doing this for the  four years that I have been posting here. The evidence is overwhelming that high fertility post-1965 nonwhites are the number one threat to the ecosystems in America. Have you seen my posts about the ecologically destabilizing giant snake head fish and Chinese legal immigrants? I&rsquo;ve made about seven of them just in the past year on American Renaissance. You&rsquo;ll never read about this on numberusa.com&hellip;over there, you are not allowed to bash - that is to say,criticize - post-1965 high fertility nonwhites. No one should give numbersusa.com a penny for its incessant worshiping of high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. Strangely, vdare.com has not posted anything about the snake head fish invasion of America which is a direct consequence of importing post-1965 high fertility Asians into our America.</p>
