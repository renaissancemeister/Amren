<h1>No More Forums About a Black Agenda</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i> John McWhorter, The Root, March 16, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Talking about racism or special programs for blacks will not change the future of African Americans. Ending the war on drugs will.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last March, there was an Event, with prominent participants, the theme of which was to call on President Barack Obama to put forth a black agenda. Holding his &#8220;feet to the fire&#8221; was a metaphor that came up here and there. I wrote the following:</p>
<p>&#8220;In March of 2011, late March to be precise, I am going to evaluate whether We Count! The Black Agenda Is the American Agenda has had any effect on the lives of black people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m going to be as fair as possible. Obviously I have a suspicion how this is going to come out, but I&rsquo;m going to go at it from a scientific frame of mind. I&rsquo;m going to do my evaluation putting myself in the mind of someone who wants to show that there was an effect. That will include that I will allow evidence that something is going to happen even if it hasn&rsquo;t yet  &mdash;  as long as it can be shown pretty clearly that the We Count! &#8216;discussion&rsquo; people had in Chicago a year ago was a part of the reason why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, here we are, and it&rsquo;s safe to say that this event had no effect upon the welfare of black Americans, or on the chances that the president will create legislation principally for blacks. Nor do I see any sign that the event will have such an effect in the future. It is a historical footnote. {snip}</p>
<p>{snip} My purpose is to point out that the time has come when discussion events on the state of black America like this, which occur all year every year across America, no longer serve the purpose we assume they do  &mdash;  i.e., helping. I want to suggest a different direction.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to miss that these &#8220;forums&#8221; are no longer a new direction. There was a time when such events galvanized black people around a common purpose: {snip}.</p>
<p>That is not happening at the typical event where some people decry racism (to applause), while others talk about responsibility and &#8220;stepping up&#8221; (to applause) and everybody goes home. Nowadays, after these events, often deemed &#8220;terrific&#8221; and &#8220;deep&#8221; by all concerned, how many poor black kids learn more, and how many fewer get shot? How many black adults know more about how to find and keep a job? How many fewer black men spend the prime of their lives in prison?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>My suggestion: Making black America better will entail battling the senseless war on drugs. Police forces assigned to trawl black neighborhoods create thousands of young black people wary of whites  &mdash;  and thus less likely to ever succeed in a world full of them. When drugs are illegal, you can make money from the markup that selling them entails, and thus, so very many young blacks step outside of legal work to do so  &mdash;  especially when their schools are bad  &mdash;  and end up in prison or a coffin.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Take away the war on drugs and all of this dissolves. With one generation of black inner-city boys who have never known cops as the enemy; who think of &#8220;slingin&rsquo; on them corners&#8221; as something old-school that no one could do now; and who stay in their neighborhoods to help raise their kids, black America would turn a corner.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The economy offers no work to young black people? Out of the many answers to that, here&rsquo;s the most important: Anything whatsoever that black boys do besides sell drugs on street corners  &mdash;  anything at all  &mdash;  would be an improvement, and we all know it. Hard drugs available at stores? Yes, in standardized (and certified clean) doses  &mdash;  along with funding, now used to terrorize inner-city blacks, freed up for rehab. That&rsquo;s a sane trade-off, especially given that there has been no addiction epidemic in countries that have relaxed their drug laws.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>I am even going to put this in a way that I almost hesitate to, but must: You may pretend that Barack Obama could institute a black agenda or govern from the left. You may wait for an America where there is no racist bias of any kind. You may pretend that we can change what goes on in black families by saying sonorous things about responsibility. But if you do, you are not fighting at all.</p>
<p>I think we should fight.<br>

		<p>Even if McWhorter gets what he wants, it still won&rsquo;t make black America any better.  It won&rsquo;t end black hostility towards cops in general and white cops in particular, because they&rsquo;ll STILL commit a disproportionate percentage of real violent crimes that even the most strident of libertarians think should be crimes.  If McWhorter gets what he wants, most of the &#8220;black inner city boys&#8221; (BTW, aren&rsquo;t we told there is no such thing as a &#8220;black boy?&#8221;) won&rsquo;t instantly go from slinging dope to studying neurosurgery.  They&rsquo;ll actually become even more shiftless and itinerant, because slinging drugs, as illegal, immoral and illicit as it is, is the only kind of &#8220;work&#8221; they can do.  Who knows where it would go from there.  </p>
<p>Are we to presume, Mr. McWhorter, that the kind of &#8220;black inner city boys&#8221; who would make a career out of selling the kinds of substances that society currently deems so dangerous as to make their sale/use/possession/transport a crime, would all of a sudden become angels or even decent human beings if those laws were repealed?</p>

		<p>I was a teenager in the 1980&rsquo;s when the crack epidemic hit the news. Black leaders were the ones that demanded harsher sentencing for crack vs powder cocaine since the low price of crack was devastating poorer inner city neighborhoods. In the 25 years since the guidelines were put in place the very communities that they were designs to help are now screaming discrimination! It really doesn&rsquo;t make sense- </p>

		<p>Charles Murray once noted that, given our current welfare system, legalizing drugs would lead to another problem. Specifically, some people would be perfectly happy to spend their lives stoned and welfare payments would make that possible, especially after legalizing drugs brought the price down.</p>
<p>But I still think that legalizing drugs is preferable to what we have now.<br>

		<p>These constant hand-wringing suggestions aimed at trying to insert square pegs into round holes as a perfect fit are a complete waste of time.</p>
<p>Black males are not going to be rocket scientists no matter what manipulations are enacted.  They will, in fact, not rise above levels necessary for janitors and other laborers no matter what is done, short of installing them in positions they aren&rsquo;t qualified for, which, incidentally, is what the elites are foolishly trying to do right now.</p>
<p>And that will end in disaster, I can promise you.</p>

I used to like McWhorter. He used to put blacks in their place and they hated him for it. He seemed to change, especially with the election of President Obama.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m of two minds over legalizing drugs. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind responsible people using drugs on their own, at home and not on the roads.</p>
<p>However, drugs are illegal for a reason. Too many people use them irresponsibly. It&rsquo;s the old story of few people spoiling it for everyone. Just a couple years ago, people used a legal substance called Phen Phen (I believe). It was sold in health food stores as an energy supplant. Apparently, it worked to give people a small boost of energy. I never used it and I never heard about it. By the time I heard of it, some girl went to a rave, took a fist full and died. It was banned. We now have restrictions on over the counter cough medicine and allergy pills because people abuse them.</p>
<p>Despite the Utopia drug advocates envision by the legalization of drugs, I don&rsquo;t believe making drugs legal will make people use them responsibly. Fewer people would go to jail but drug related accidents and domestic incidents would likely skyrocket and they would likely be banned again.</p>
<p>We all know some white kids use drugs but why is it that they seem to use them more responsibly? There must be drug dealers in the white suburbs but why are there no turf wars or drive-by shootings? Even with meth in rural communities. Other than home robberies, where is the meth related violence?</p>
<p>Whites and minorities seem to use drugs differently. Making drugs legal won&rsquo;t stop blacks from being blacks and misbehaving.</p>
<p>As I always say, I could care less what blacks do so long as they do it in their own communities. And that&rsquo;s the problem. They want openly flaunt their dysfunction in every community they infiltrate. When they make their own communities uninhabitable, they move to whiter pastures.</p>

No one can dispute that there is a wildly disproportionate amount of black on white crime, but the fearmongering about crime in general did nothing but service the private-prison complex (CCC/Wackenhut)and teach non-violent offenders valuable skills like &#8220;shank-making 101&#8221; before releasing them onto the public.</p>
<p>Taking non-violent offenders and placing them in medium security prison, knowing they are going to be re-released into the community, is a recipe for disaster. Kenneth Hartman points out that there was a downward trajectory of crime over the course of twenty years running concurrent with an explosion of our prison population. These two don&rsquo;t go together and we&rsquo;re being perceieved as a rather draconian state.</p>
<p>Decriminalization is tricky because what&rsquo;s good for one country is not necessarily good for another. A good example is healthcare. Socialized medicine goes over great guns in Europe but we&rsquo;re about to find out exactly why it won&rsquo;t work here. Same with drugs. The Netherlands might be mature enough to handle it, but something tells me we can&rsquo;t pull it off.</p>

		<p>Actually, ending the war on drugs will make life better for everyone in America.  It escalates violence, wastes police manpower, and encourages the formation of gangs to promote the acquisition, distribution and addiction to drugs.  Were so-called illegal drugs made legal, one would see an extreme drop in the levels of violence in this country.  I do not deny that those drugs have extremely deleterious effects on the individual using them.  The effort to quash a personal choice has incredibly deleterious effects.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m for ending the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; but not for the same reasons as this guy. With people like this it&rsquo;s damned if you do damned if you don&rsquo;t, so you just have to ignore them.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if John McWhorter has written similar articles about how alcohol and &#8220;having a liquor store on every corner&#8221; has destroyed the black community blah blah blah&hellip;&hellip; We&rsquo;ve heard it all before. </p>
<p>&#8221; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be as fair as possible. Obviously I have a suspicion how this is going to come out, but I&rsquo;m going to go at it from a scientific frame of mind. I&rsquo;m going to do my evaluation putting myself in the mind of someone who wants to show that there was an effect&#8221;. <br>
This kind of contradiction in principle is very prevalent in the black community when talking about science. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s an IQ thing or not but the basic concept of science seems to be lost on them.  </p>

		<p>Brillant Thinking&hellip;simply Brillant.<br>
The real culprit is the War on Drugs. Drugs arent a<br>
problem, they dont destroy self respect, destroy brain<br>
tissue, destroy physical bodies, destroy will power, takeover all thought processes,<br>
reduce all of life to a quest for the next escapist high.<br>
no no.. the real problem is recognizing all this. The <br>
real answer to drug addict escapism..is total socially<br>
sanctioned escapism. Is this writer, by chance, a drug<br>
addict himself? This article has all the hall marks<br>
of addict style &#8220;thinking&#8221; which is no thinking at all,<br>
just verbal smokescreens built around the craving for more<br>
drugs. Remember with addicts it is always&hellip;always the drug<br>
that does the talking. The person disappeared long ago.</p>

		<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of the damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&rsquo;t premise.  Blacks constantly complain of the impact of drugs and drug-selling on their communities, yet any stepped-up law enforcement faces sure criticism.<br>
I personally support complete legalization of all drugs.  It&rsquo;s the only way to stop the illegal trade that wrecks ghetto communities, overburdens the police, and fills up jails and prisons.  Criminalization of drugs apparently doesn&rsquo;t lessen the usage, and, if street drugs were sold openly and freely, the cost would go down, thus ruining the profit motive for current steet-corner sellers.  <br>
I often watch cop shows on TV.  Nine times out of ten, any ghetto black man who is stopped will have a number of outstanding warrants.  He will try to elude the police, whether in a speeding car or on foot.  Both cops and bystanders are endangered by the chase.  Many times these men have several warrants, evidencing the courts&rsquo; practice of simply putting them back on the street with their promise of returning for trial  &mdash;  which they apparently seldom do.  If jails weren&rsquo;t crammed with drug offenders, surely men in for other crimes could be held until sentencing.  No matter how many times these arrestees fail to appear, they&rsquo;re allowed bail again or just released.  <br>
I sometimes wonder if the government fears decriminalizing street drugs because it would take &#8220;jobs&#8221; away from blacks.  Of course, poor blacks made a living in the days before welfare or widespread dope dealing.  They used to do many of the jobs that illegal Mexicans now do.<br>
Street drugs cannot be effectively prohibited any more than alcohol.  Someday, decriminalization  &mdash;  if not full legalization  &mdash;  will undoubtedly occur.<br>

		<p>Even if the &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; were miraculously ended, blacks would still clamor for more.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say Jamarcus Washington OD&rsquo;d on heroin, now a legal drug once again. His family would be demanding more money to be spent on rehab centers, midnight basketball, and other programs. Municipal budgets would go through the roof, for one thing.</p>
<p>Besides, who is the black community to guarantee that crimes still won&rsquo;t be committed? Suppose Jamarcus and a few of his hip-hophead friends crawl into a car, and wind up running a couple of people over? What if they invited Tanika Jimerson over to hang out, and they gang-raped her? What if they were short of money, to buy even more, legal over-the-counter narcotics, and decided to rob Jose Escobar&rsquo;s liquor store, shotgunning him for resisting?</p>
<p>Legalizing banned narcotics could produce even worse misery.</p>

		<p>While I found the article to be full of the usual justifications, excuses and pandering, the comments were actually refreshing.  It was downright odd to see so many blacks actually admitting that their problems are their own to solve.  If more of them can be turned to this mindset we might see hope for blacks after all.<br>
 <br>
I was particularly intrigued with how many recognized that government gimme programs were destroying them from within.<br>

		<p>What if the law were changed so that drug use was made legal for blacks, but not for whites.  That would address the concerns of the black &#8220;community&#8221;, wouldn&rsquo;t it?  They would no longer be subject to the depredations attendent on criminal prosecution of drug offences, only to the depredations caused by the drug-use itself.  And it would send an unmistakable message too.  That we whites hold ourselves to a higher standard.</p>
<p>Actually, I generally agree with Mr. McWhorter, on the course of action he proposes, if not the reasons.  I think the war-on-drugs is insane, and only leads to the increasing erosion of our liberties.  Mr. McWhorter is an honorable man, who wants what is good for his people.  I would just point out to him that, just as he wants what is good for his people, I want what is good for mine, and that his people and mine are not the same, and what is good for these two respective groups may not be the same thing.</p>

		<p>Prohibition of alcohol only served to create a gigantic criminal enterprise that came close to completely controlling this country.</p>
<p>Legalizing drugs is the only alternative to a country that is slowly spiraling downward economically, because the revenue will be needed in order to keep from reneging on public pensions and laying off 90% of public employees, which is the direction this country is headed.</p>
<p>Too, drug prohibition, unlike alcohol is creating a HUGE criminal class that threatens to take over entire governments, if drugs are not legalized.</p>

		<p>I favor legalizing drugs only if certain conditions are met:</p>
<p>An end to the welfare state, except for old age pensions.  No AFDC, food stamps, housing subsidies, etc.  Also, any government subsidized rehab and other drug treatment must be financed 100% by taxes on the drugs themselves.</p>
<p>What won&rsquo;t work is making drugs legal and cheap and then burdening the taxpayer with the welfare and drug treatment programs that the drug addicts then need.</p>
<p>The program above might really help black neighborhoods.  Not because drugs are legalized, but because welfare is ended.  But as an aside, if illegal immigration isn&rsquo;t ended there won&rsquo;t be any jobs for those blacks who want honest work to do.  So add enforcement of immigration laws to the list.<br>

		<p>If recreational drugs are legal, then you have ever more problems related to the use of those drugs: domestic violence, low productivity, trauma care. If they are illegal, then you have problems due to the criminals who get into the business of supplying those drugs  &mdash;  especially intergang violence.</p>
<p>The fact that blacks are most heavily involved in the illegal drug distribution business can be attributed to the fact that blacks just don&rsquo;t have much else happening: the police don&rsquo;t seriously patrol their neighborhoods (so drug selling is easier), and blacks are less likely to take off on a career as  rocket scientist or CEO (so drug selling is more attractive). </p>

		<p>The so-called &#8220;War on Drugs&#8221; is an ongoing national insanity that, like prohibition, has created an entire wealthy and huge criminal class, corrupted cops at all levels, driven addicts to criminal behavior to support their habits, and cost the public enormous endless enforcement expenditures.</p>
<p>If the stuff were legal there&rsquo;d be no money in it and no criminal behavior required to support drug habits.  When&rsquo;s the last time anybody heard of a liquor store being robbed to make off with the inventory? Or a turf war by liquor store owners?</p>
<p>Nations that have decriminalized drugs haven&rsquo;t experienced any sudden increase in drug usage by the population at large, though places like Amsterdam have seen an increase in promiscous displays of drug use, mainly by foreigners who gather there to enjoy freedom from drug prosecution.</p>
<p>Back before drug prohibition in this country, every local drug store sold narcotic drugs over the counter, including heroin and its derivatives.  The country wasn&rsquo;t populated by the stoned, incapacitated, and permanently addled then, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be now if drugs were decriminalized. And street crime motivated by the need to support an expensive habit would diminish immediately.</p>
<p>Stopping this madness is long overdue.</p>

		<p>To correct centuries of racial discrimination, perhaps we should make drugs legal for everybody - except for white people, who will still be barred from buying, using or possessing them.</p>
<p>Then we can see if white youths will make gangs and stuff.  At the least it will preserve the bulk of our kids from becoming useless potheads.</p>
<p>For the life of me I do not understand how anyone can call for legalizing something that turns people into retards.  Can a cocaine addict be a productive member of society?  I have &#8216;students&rsquo; in grade 11 who are stoned all the time, even when they come to school.  They do no work, act like idiots and ruin the class for everyone else.  </p>
<p>Should we expand that population?  If you make it legal, how can you prevent it from spreading?  Don&rsquo;t say counseling or ad campaigns, because at the end of the day, the children will say, &#8220;But it&rsquo;s legal, so it&rsquo;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>I also think it might be fun to run that legalization experiment just to shut the promoters up.  </p>

		<p>I am trying to think on a practical level here. If you legalize it, how is the stuff marketed?  It is still a dangerous substance and should be sold only at pharmcies or specially created drug dispensaries, where the addict has to be registered to get his fix and sign for every dose he gets. If he can not make any money on it anymore, will there be a big interest to recruit new druggies?  <br>
How about an ongoing TV campaign,on every channel there is, showing the druggies in their &#8220;natural&#8221; state of existence, from health issues, to death, from living quarters to relationships, The whole squalid existence.  <br>
A new problem would arise,  All the out of work drug dealers. <br>
I have no idea what to do with people who can not work. Have them sort trash at recycling centers. </p>

		<p>Uh the blacks that get sucked into the drug trade are probably not the kind of people that would succeed if it wasn&rsquo;t for the irresistible allure of drug dealing. Most of them would probably just resort to more destructive crimes like robbery. At least the way things are now, many of these very dangerous people simply sell drugs to their own people and kill one another off battling for turf or another nonsense.</p>

		<p>More often than not one will discover free <a>CNA training</a> through medical centers and as a result managers. You have to realize that the entire pediatric schools in addition to methods repeatedly are those which shall be rendering free CNA activities. To reach professional to free you simply must expect to have an interviewer send to this particular courses and the best kinds hours they&rsquo;re going pay it off.        <br>
        <br>
Often hostipal wards and / or maybe nursing buildings have definitely agreements utilizing district faculties that enable these people to deliver CNA people in the course to highschool to receive cut down quotes. This important ends up of the companies that may be on the go available for CNA staffing, properly ends up really towards classmates that may be fascinated with buying schooled as being a CNA.      <br>
      <br>
One way that a person can probably generate free CNA training is as simple as emailing whether this military, that will be more compared with willing to post you to assist you CNA, LVN so RN training programs. Those tools will be hectic, as well as ideal jobs at the private market. Check out doors nearby hiring organizations.      <br>
      <br>
At last any person laid-off much like some of us are, having been fired organizations are going to gladly cover the cost of CNA training. Typically the government is now spending so much time to generate some individuals back up in jobs, transforming into a CNA is actually a rapidly preparation, as well as being achievable that can be used. I realize a handful somebody that has turned free CNA qualifying measures using this tactic.      <br>
      <br>
Typically i&rsquo;m interested in CNA document merely because we want work, given that are laid-off was besides not solely heading to feature the Six hundred rupees to spend for the idea higher education. Just fatigue all these selections before taking released financing. Commonly occasion you search with enough contentration there can be alternate option how can someone already have all of this paid to have.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Should we expand that population? If you make it legal, how can you prevent it from spreading? Don&rsquo;t say counseling or ad campaigns, because at the end of the day, the children will say, &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s legal, so it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t, and based on the observation of that 11 year old YOU CAN&rsquo;T. This idea that we need to save people from there own bad choices when they clearly have alternative choices just as accessible as the &#8220;bad choices&#8221; is destroying both the freedom principles on which this nations constitution was founded on, but also putting us deeply into dept. That is why. Your position allows pot heads to burden me with their own bad choices.  </p>

I see.. okay the War on Drugs is a war on free choice and<br>
its poor economics. Lets take every moral element out of it<br>
and look at the &#8220;economic&#8221; argument. For example..whose<br>
&#8220;free choice&#8221; is being denied? The wife whose drug addicted<br>
husband leaves her alone unsupported? How about the &#8220;free choice&#8221;<br>
of the drug addicts children? Or the drug addicts employer?<br>
Do the druggies children get to choose for a absent father?<br>
Does the employer get to choose for the destroyed machinery,<br>
medical bills, or ruined reputation of his company all caused<br>
by the druggie? How about the cost of prosecuting and incarcerating druggies..its horrible to build concrete boxes<br>
called jails to warehouse druggies as a result of their choices.<br>
No..much more economical to bring all of society down to the drug<br>
addict level of escapism, moral indifference, self absorption<br>
and surrender. That will surely be a sound long term choice.</p>

		<p>&gt;Fewer people would go to jail but drug related accidents and domestic incidents would likely skyrocket and they would likely be banned again.</p>
<p>Many countries in Europe have decriminalized drugs and have not seen the litany of horrors which you imagine. </p>
<p>&gt;They&rsquo;ll actually become even more shiftless and itinerant, because slinging drugs, as illegal, immoral and illicit as it is, is the only kind of &ldquo;work&rdquo; they can do. Who knows where it would go from there. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather step over an addict than get mugged by one. </p>
<p>&gt;We now have restrictions on over the counter cough medicine and allergy pills because people abuse them.</p>
<p>Actually, the sale of ephedrine is monitored and limited because of ephedrine&rsquo;s structural similarity to methamphetamine. It can be used to create methamphetamine using chemical reduction in which ephedrine&rsquo;s hydroxy group is removed; this has made ephedrine a highly sought-after chemical precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. For this reason it is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. </p>
<p>&gt;would all of a sudden become angels or even decent human beings if those laws were repealed?</p>
<p>Incentives work.  The lucrative rewards offered by the black market in drugs draw in entrepreneurial talent. </p>
<p>&gt;Making drugs legal won&rsquo;t stop blacks from being blacks and misbehaving.</p>
<p>True.  </p>
<p>&gt;Legalizing banned narcotics could produce even worse misery.</p>
<p>For most our nation&rsquo;s history, hemp, opium, and coca were in fact legal. 100 years ago our great-grandparents could walk into a drug store and buy the stuff by the pound. It was cash and carry, no questions asked. Did we have neighborhoods infested by crack gangs? Drive-by shootings?  International drug cartels taking over entire nation-states?  What was the murder rate 100 years ago compared with today?</p>
<p>&gt;If recreational drugs are legal, then you have ever more problems related to the use of those drugs: domestic violence, low productivity, trauma care</p>
<p>That assumes that legalization will inevitably lead to a massive increase in drug abuse.  Is this what has happened in Europe? </p>

And that is precisely what the druggie does..day in and day out<br>
infringe other peoples rights. I am sick of preserving the <br>
&#8220;free choice&#8221; of these morally handicapped people. Society<br>
has a right to be protected from them by whatever means<br>
necessary. Furthermore the <br>
number of choices a druggie has should be severely limited.<br>
First bad &#8220;choice&#8221;..rehab and counseling. Second bad &#8220;choice&#8221;<br>
rehabilitation and a nice hard labor sentence. Third bad<br>
&#8220;choice&#8221; society should end it by exercising the China Option.</p>

<p>John:</p>
<p>I wanted to commend you for your very well-written, succinct post.  I am also happy to see more and more people understanding and realizing the futility of the billion dollar war against drugs and how this insane &#8220;war&#8221; causes average American citizens more harm than the drug dealers.</p>
<p>What have been the results?    <i>The Drug Warriors believe your Constitutional rights are a small price to pay for the victory they promise is coming.</i></p>
<p>Despite all the &#8220;just say no&#8221; propaganda, media attention touting huge drug busts, billions of dollars wasted chasing drug dealers, typing up of law enforcement agencies and government justification of eroding your Civil Liberties in the name of &#8220;fighting drugs&#8221;, the Drug Wars continue unabated.</p>
<p>From Jay:</p>
<p><i>For the life of me I do not understand how anyone can call for legalizing something that turns people into retards. I have &lsquo;students&rsquo; in grade 11 who are stoned all the time, even when they come to school. They do no work, act like idiots and ruin the class for everyone else.</i></p>
<p>Comrade:  Legalizing drugs will not cause that 11th grader to suddenly start paying attention in class and become a world-class scholar.  He&rsquo;s a retard and will disrupt your class with or without drugs.  </p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t the disruptive 11th grader, the problem is an educational system that allows any kid, drugged or otherwise, to disrupt class with impunity, blaming YOU instead of the kid for his aberrant behavior.  It is a violation of the other kids&rsquo; Civil Rights, and yours as well as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.   I see it every day.</p>
<p>Besides that, how could children have more access to drugs than they do now?</p>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t happen in the US after the Prohibition on Alcohol was lifted, and:</p>
<p><i>Even though Prohibition ended in the middle of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the crime rate began falling immediately. And it continued downward for 30 years.</i></p>
