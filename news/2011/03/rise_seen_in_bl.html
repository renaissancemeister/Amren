<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 31% spike in murders of African-Americans in 2010 accounted for all of last year&rsquo;s nearly 14% citywide increase in homicides, according to an analysis by the New York Police Department.</p>
<p>Black people, who comprise 25% of the city&rsquo;s population, accounted for 67% of the 536 murders in 2010, according to the report released Tuesday. Black men 15 to 29 years old were most likely to be killed. They make up less than 3% of the city&rsquo;s population but last year represented 33% of all homicide victims, according to the report.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Ric Curtis, an anthropology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he {snip} doesn&rsquo;t necessarily think gangs are to blame. &#8220;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s complex because it&rsquo;s not readily apparent what is causing it,&#8221; Mr. Curtis said.<br>

		<p>Never fear!! Even if it&rsquo;s proven to be black on black crime somehow someway white racism and discrimination along with poverty will get blamed.If you were to blame black murderers for the killing of other blacks that would prove you&rsquo;re nothing more than a heartless racist who cares little for the true victims.Those true victims must be all black people including the killers.</p>

		<p>It is mind-boggling the degree to which certain &#8220;protected groups&#8221; in America can ALWAYS be cast as victim only - never as perpetrator even when their guilt is glaringly obvious! Blacks are hardly the only ones in this category, but they must surely occupy one of the uppermost spots on the list. And we wonder why the issues are never really addressed. </p>

		<p>It amazes me that academics are so educated that they can&rsquo;t see the simple truth before their eyes.  No need to over analyze it,just watch the local news,or drive through an inner city. The problem is crystal clear but academic liberal PC makes it impossible to admit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rise Seen in Black Victims&#8221;</p>
<p>By Sean Gardiner</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s complex because it&rsquo;s not readily apparent what is causing it,&#8221; Mr. Curtis said.</p>
<p>Why did your article quote Curtis as if he was telling the truth or that he was the last word in the matter?</p>
<p>Why no mention about the simple fact that blacks are being killed by blacks in 99% of the cases? Why no mention of the criminal circumstances</p>
<p>of these killings?  Is your undestanding of &#8220;truth&#8221; or your commitment to journalism so weak, so befuddled by Poltical Correctness that you censor even the most basic facts from reporting? Hmm?</p>
<p>Good luck Sean&hellip; it must be interesting to watch you try to be a reporter while forcing yourself to evade, lie and deny reality. Quite a daily tap dance</p>
<p>I am sure.</p>

<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>Until the WSJ starts reporting black-on-white rapes, torture-murders and black-created hoaxes forthrightly and honestly and black-on-white genocide in South Africa, I could not care less how many blacks murder each other on the streets of NY.</p>
<p>When the WSJ starts identifying blacks as those who disproportionally murder and rape whites, and I mean in every instance, reports honestly the huge number of black-on-white crimes and warns whites, in no uncertain terms, of the danger of black criminals, I could not care less about black-on-black crime or any other &#8220;crime&#8221; reporting done by the WSJ. </p>
<p>There is no honesty anywhere in any msm medium about crimes, murders, rapes and robberies committed by blacks against whites. In fact, one gets the strong impression from the msm that most, if not all criminal acts are white-on-black.  Until and unless there is honest reporting about the true nature of black criminal hatred and mayhem against whites, I have nothing but contempt for anything the msm report.</p>

<p>Mr. Ric Curtis knows very well what the problem is. </p>
<p><br>
The real problem is that everyone and I mean everyone is afraid to come right out and say what the problems is. </p>
<p>Come on folks, the Emperior has no chothes and blacks are lagging behind on the evolutionary ladder. If you were to take all the black people in the world with an IQ of over a 100 and put them on an island somewhere the proof would emerge. More intelligent and more civilized peoples don&rsquo;t kill each other at the same rate as those just starting up the ladder. </p>

		<p>Ric Curtis, an anthropology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he and his colleagues were asked by the Brooklyn District Attorney&rsquo;s Office last year to explore whether gangs are behind the spike; some 11% of all murder victims were gang members. But Mr. Curtis said he doesn&rsquo;t necessarily think gangs are to blame. &#8220;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s complex because it&rsquo;s not readily apparent what is causing it,&#8221; Mr. Curtis said.<br>

This article reminds me of articles describing how the most recent effort to enable blacks to perform as well in school as whites has failed. The deep thinkers will scratch their heads, considering this possibility and that one, while ignoring the obvious reason. <br>

		<p>Prof. Curtis doesn&rsquo;t know what to blame?</p>
<p>I once had a problem with skunks living under my house. I phoned a number of pest control companies, but no one would fool with it. So I called the Professor of the wildlife department at the renowned nearby state university for any suggestions. His suggestion was - in all seriousness - to dig a 3ft by 3ft ditch around my house and fill it with water, as &#8216;skunks don&rsquo;t cross water&rsquo;. I told him sarcastically that was just perfect - if I COULD dig a ditch that deep all the way around my house and if I COULD get enough water to fill it, and if he WAS right (which he wasn&rsquo;t) about skunks not crossing water, then he was a bit off - the skunks were ALREADY under my house and that would ensure they would never leave. Also, I asked him, &#8220;Have you never seen a National Geographic special? Skunks swim like otters, you damn fool. Did you get your teaching certificate at Wal-Mart? That&rsquo;s the dumbest thing I ever heard. And you&rsquo;re making big money and teaching our children? Who did you sleep with to get this job?&#8221; And I hung up.</p>
<p>These are the people who are brainwashing our children. So, Prof. Curtis. You are in good company. You are truly a nitwit. </p>

		<p>I sometimes wonder if (blacks) ever wonder why there isn&rsquo;t this much resentment against any other race, Asian, Hispanic, whatever.<br>
Some people seem to not mind being around other races, some dont.<br>
But with blacks it seems as if no race on the planet Earth is that interested in mingling with them.<br>
It is NOT skin color, so they need to ask themselves what is it?<br>
Is it behaviours? Is it attitude? Just what is it?<br>
The reasons are fairly obvious to most people.</p>

		<p>Compared to Chicago, New York&rsquo;s Bantus have it pretty good. In 2010, some 88% of Chicago&rsquo;s murder victims were Bantus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s laughable that this professor Curtis pretends not to know why Bantus are being killed.</p>
