<h1><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/03/29/BAF01IKVNI.DTL">Chauncey Bailey Shooter Laughed at Killings</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Henry K. Lee, San Francisco Chronicle, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Devaughndre Broussard chuckled in the trial of bakery leader Yusuf Bey IV and another member of the group as he recalled how one victim tried to run away before Broussard emptied an assault rifle at him.</p>
<p>Bey and the other member, Antoine Mackey, made fun of how another victim&rsquo;s leg flew up in the air when he was riddled with rounds from a rifle, Broussard said.</p>
<p>In between the chilling details of those two slayings, Broussard testified for the first time about the shooting death of Chauncey Bailey, whom Bey allegedly ordered killed to prevent the Oakland journalist from writing about the black empowerment group&rsquo;s financial collapse.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It was Broussard&rsquo;s second day on the witness stand in the murder trial. He has confessed to being the gunman who killed Bailey with three shotgun blasts on Aug. 2, 2007, as the Oakland Post editor was walking to work at 14th and Alice streets in downtown Oakland.</p>
<p>Bey ordered up another slaying less than a month before Bailey&rsquo;s death, telling Broussard to kill Odell Roberson, 31, the uncle of the man who shot and killed Bey&rsquo;s brother, Broussard said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But after Broussard reported that he and Mackey couldn&rsquo;t find the elder Phillips, Bey told him to kill Roberson, a &#8220;dope fiend&#8221; and transient who lived on the streets of Oakland near the now-defunct bakery, Broussard testified.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Broussard, 23, burst into laughter on the stand when he recounted how Roberson had tried to run away when he leveled an SKS assault rifle at him. He said he had fired the rifle &#8220;until the clip was empty,&#8221; about eight to 10 rounds. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mackey is accused of killing a third victim, 36-year-old Michael Wills, in July 2007. Bey, who is accused of ordering the killing, boasted about &#8220;getting&#8221; a white &#8220;devil,&#8221; Broussard said.</p>
<p>Mackey and Bey made fun of how Wills&rsquo; leg flew up after he was shot, with both men shouting, &#8220;It&rsquo;s good!&#8221; while raising their arms straight up, simulating a field goal, Broussard testified.</p>

		<p>I am all for an eye for eye type society. The minute that guy started chuckling and then recounting the horrific details about that guys leg he should have been automatically been taken to a room with a guy with a gun. The guy with the gun would then get the chance to blow off his body parts with the automatic rifle. Then go get the other guy and do the exact same thing. When we begin dealing with crimes in this fashion the lack of regard for humanity that consumes this nation may finally start to dissipate.</p>
