<h1>Outreach to Hispanics Is Restarted</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>MJ Lee, Politico, March 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>For the first time since the midterm elections, President Obama will talk to a Hispanic audience for a town-hall-style conversation about education.</p>
<p>The forum will be hosted by Univision, the largest Spanish-language TV network in the country, and moderated by the journalist Jorge Ramos. Students, teachers and parents will be in the audience. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In Univision&rsquo;s announcement, the network didn&rsquo;t mention that immigration would be discussed, but the topic is likely to come up. Obama has supported the Dream Act bill that would change the country&rsquo;s immigration system.</p>
<p>Obama has collaborated with Univision Communications on a number of occasions since taking office, particularly by granting interviews in the months before the midterms. {snip}<br/>

		<p>This is all political, and all looking out for 2012.  If Hispanics don&rsquo;t vote for him by about the same percentage in 2012 that they did in 2008, he&rsquo;s done for, and I think he knows it.  However, the national average is that if you lose nine Hispanic votes, you need to gain only one white vote to get back to even par.  But the converse is also true   &mdash;   If you lose one white vote, then you need to gain 9 Hispanics to get back to even par.  Obama knows his white vote percent will be smaller in 2012 than 2008, so he&rsquo;s really got to try to go All In with the Hispanic vote.  The black vote, he&rsquo;s got in the bag.</p>

<p><br/>
Indeed, Obama did &#8220;collaborate&#8221; with Univision prior to the 2010 midterms.  That&rsquo;s when he told Univision&rsquo;s Hispanic audience to &#8220;punish our enemies&#8221;: </p>
<p>&#8220;And if Latinos sit out the election instead of saying, we&rsquo;re gonna punish our enemies and we&rsquo;re gonna reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us, if they don&rsquo;t see that kind of upsurge in voting in this election, then I think it&rsquo;s [amnesty&rsquo;s] gonna be harder and that&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s so important that people focus on voting on November 2.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I quote this from&hellip;&hellip;..http://cambriawillnotyield.blogspot.com/2011/02/hating-ones-own.html</p>
<p>A lesson WE all need to learn. Pass it on to your children and the misguided Christians in your midst.</p>
<p>&#8220;The toleration of the rape of their women is not a simple case of cowardice on the part of the British white males, although that most certainly is the assumption of the Pakistani males. Like the jackal, who is a coward himself, the Pakistanis attack only those who are weaker and more cowardly than themselves, and to them it seems obvious that the white Brits are cowards. But it is not because of fear that the British white male does not fight for his own. The British male does not fight for his own kind because he doesn&rsquo;t believe there is any such thing as kin or kind. There are only generic people, all moving toward a generic, colored utopia. And that&rsquo;s the main point: the white European male has been told for upwards of fifty years that white people are evil and have no right to exist. So why should he care when white women, mothers of the future, either lose their lives or are ruined for life? By liberal logic he shouldn&rsquo;t care, and in point of fact he doesn&rsquo;t care. Walter Scott would care, Rudyard Kipling would care, but the Brits and their European counterparts do not want to live in Scott&rsquo;s and Kipling&rsquo;s Europe.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a case then of no innards; it&rsquo;s a case of no Christian innards. The British male will fight for a multi-racial Britain, but he will fight against a Christian Britain. And because of that fact, the Brits&rsquo; unwillingness to fight for a Christian Britain, the warning of the Mercia Police Inspector will go unheeded. <br/>
  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  -</p>
<p>This concerns the Paki&rsquo;s in Britain. This is also the case with the nonwhites (blacks, mexicans, etc.) in the USA. This is also the case of the cowardice of White males in America and worldwide, it seems. We need to heed the above and below.</p>
<p>&#8220;the Pakistanis attack only those who are weaker and more cowardly than themselves, and to them it seems obvious that the white Brits are cowards.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is obvious we have become the &#8220;weaker&#8221; race when we cave into the horrific behaviors against us committed by nonwhites all over the world. The term &#8220;racist&#8221; leveled against us drops us to our knees and we allow our OWN to be raped, murdered, assaulted, demonized and jailed for fear of being labeled a &#8220;racist&#8221;. How much lower can we go? How our brave ancestors would recoil in horror at what their descendants have become.</p>

		<p>This is also from the link I posted above that I forgot to post. Is this not true of most of us here at Amren? </p>
<p>&#8220;The &lsquo;get out the information&rsquo; boys of the BNP and the AMERICAN RENAISSANCE always fail to make a breach in the liberals&rsquo; fortress because they think: 1) white people will &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; if they get the information about colored atrocities, and 2) once awakened, white people will &#8220;vote&#8221; the colored people away. &lsquo;Tis not so. As we have seen time and time again, white people do know about the colored invasion and about colored atrocities, but they approve of the invasion and think the atrocities have to be tolerated so that the greater good, a multi-colored society, can become a reality.&#8221;</p>
