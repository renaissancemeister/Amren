<h1>Activists Propose &#8216;Majority Minority&rsquo; Congressional District for Washington</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jim Brunner, Seattle Times, March 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>As work begins on reshaping Washington&rsquo;s congressional-district boundaries, some local activists want to see the state create a district that  &mdash;  for the first time  &mdash;  would be more than half minority.</p>
<p>That could be done, just barely, by combining Southeast Seattle with the suburbs south of the city, where the minority population has exploded over the past decade.</p>
<p>The Win/Win Network, a nonprofit group, drew up the potential &#8220;majority people of color&#8221; district and plans to submit it to the Washington State Redistricting Commission, the bipartisan panel charged with redrawing the state&rsquo;s political map this year.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The new district would stretch from Southeast Seattle to Federal Way. It would follow the boundaries of several legislative districts: the 11th, 30th, 33rd, 37th and 47th.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The &#8220;majority minority&#8221; district  &mdash;  one of the first new congressional district ideas to publicly emerge  &mdash;  faces some serious obstacles.</p>
<p>For starters, the idea of splitting the city of Seattle between two districts may prove controversial. The city currently is contained entirely within the 7th Congressional District.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Splitting Seattle could prove unpalatable to Republicans, since it would put the city&rsquo;s overwhelmingly Democratic vote at play in two congressional races instead of one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Another potential objection is that the district wouldn&rsquo;t give a majority to any single ethnic or racial minority  &mdash;  rather it would treat all of them as a single bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;It assumes it&rsquo;s whites versus everybody else. That&rsquo;s not very helpful,&#8221; said Richard Morrill, a Seattle demographer and University of Washington geography professor emeritus.</p>

		<p>At what point does blatant and deliberate gerrymandering completely undermine the legitimacy of representative democracy?</p>
<p>This rigging of the electoral process shows a contempt for the people and their choices and opinions. Which tells ou a lot about the sectarian priorities of these &#8216;nonprofit groups&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>Majority/minority: Remember that Whites are minorities, globally.  We have about 2% of the global population of fertile females (we&rsquo;re somewhere around 7-8% total).  That&rsquo;s right  &mdash;   Whites are the global minority.</p>
<p>This is just one reason why Whites need to demand that they stay majority (and move towards 90%+ from there) in all of their White nations.  </p>
<p>Whites suffer under White genocide.  It really is that simple.  Poster Jupiter7/Jupiter has been saying &#8220;Race-Replacement&#8221; for years on this blog.  Is anyone paying attention?</p>
<p>The immigration is always non-White, and it goes to all White countries and only White nations.  Nobody is asking for black countries to become &#8220;Multicultural.&#8221;  Nobody is telling the brown countries that they are too brown.  It is ONLY White nations that get kicked around with the White guilt about being &#8220;too White.&#8221; &#8220;Not diverse enough.&#8221; </p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this obvious?  We are being race-replaced.  This is White genocide.  Call it White genocide! Put it in the public.  Whites are not racial by nature.  You must present the problem in direct terms or most Whites will never, ever, wake up to their dispossession and genocide until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It assumes it is Whites against everyone else&#8221;</p>
<p>Correct.  And this is precisely how every, and I mean every, single race views anything.  It is only Whites that are non-racial, and the reasons for this are complex.  But all you really need to know is that Whites are, by race/genetics, &#8220;less racial.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is why it is important for sites like Amren, and intelligent racially-aware Whites like YOU to present important racial interests to your individualistic White friends.</p>
<p>Other minorities have taken advantage of this promiscuous altruism of Whites.  We must end it.  In a multicultural, globalist society, why should Whites be the ONLY group who is playing for the other team?  </p>

		<p>This would be my new congressional district.  Aside from the racial pandering, though, it&rsquo;s not as big a deal as it sounds.  Most of the whites living around here already vote like they&rsquo;re from Mogadishu anyway.  Not much would change in the grand scheme.</p>

<p>Yes, poster this is so true!  Jupiter7 is right. I have been saying this same thing for at least 20 years or more. I believe that most posters here do pay attention to this and know this as a fact. Problem is, most Whites will never listen because they are too scared to face reality and do not want to be called a racist if they do face that fact. What we need is for the Rushs, the Hannity&rsquo;s, the Levins. the Becks to start saying it!! But of course they won&rsquo;t for fear of losing those big checks they get and most of them all have blacks working at their stations or a few personal black friends. They may get offended, dontchaknow.</p>

		<p> More racial gerrymandering coming up in the state of Washington, one of the most liberal areas of the country. How terribly inconvenient that the proposed, bizarre district would contain a jumble of minorities, instead of just   &mdash;   oh, let&rsquo;s see   &mdash;   BLACKS.</p>
<p> Funny, isn&rsquo;t it, how the assumption is that a White legislator will not vote in favor of blacks&rsquo; interests (bad!)   &mdash;   while on the other hand, it&rsquo;s assumed that making a district 55 percent or more minority will assure that the legislator will be a minority too, because minorities   &mdash;   especially blacks   &mdash;   won&rsquo;t vote for a White candidate if they have one of their own as an alternative (good!)</p>
<p> But then, nowadays so many people, and the mainstream media, are deaf and blind to irony.</p>

		<p>I live here, and I can guarantee you, a congressional district which included South Seattle and the suburban towns to the south would not be a gerrymandered district. In fact, it would concentrate a lot of voters with like interests in a single district.</p>
<p>Better make up your mind. In earlier decades, many  Republicans complained about the practice of dividing minority votes among several districts, allowing Democratic control of these districts, but never electing minority representatives.</p>
<p>Following the 1990 census, under political and legal pressure this practice began to decline resulting in the election of more minority representatives. Then Republican and conservatives began to complain about minority districts.</p>
<p>Having minority districts is far preferable to dividing the minority vote among otherwise conservative-leaning districts. Preferable for everyone. Here in Washington, no guarantee that this proposed district would elect a minority representative in any case, and if it did, what minority? Along with a large black population, there are other minorities and immigrants from dozens of countries living in these town, and whites would remain the largest element in the electorate.</p>
<p>Creating minority districts was one factor in the Republicans overturning the Democrats&rsquo; permanent control of the House in the 1990s.</p>

		<p>This is how Newt Gingrich got elected. Democrats gerrymandered essentially a 100% black district in Georgia so blacks could have one of their own in Washington. This sucked Democrat votes away from Newt&rsquo;s opponent, helping Newt get elected.</p>

		<p>Very wise words from Anonymoose.  Stacking minorities in majority-minority districts is key to creating conservative districts amenable to white interests elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Well the business community that provides the funding and voters of the Republican party are bound and determined to bring in every kind of non White immigrant cheap labor so one would think that the Republicans would be happy to get more minority voters.</p>
<p>Poor Bill Gates.  He still has a few positions filled by White Americans.  If only there were more non White immigrants his company would be 100 percent minority immigrant.</p>

		<p>It is indeed whites versus everyone else, and it&rsquo;s always been that way. The fact that there are whites collaborating with those who want us exterminated shows how evil, stupid or greedy the wealthy whites can be in their pursuit of the dollar. The greatest threat to our physical survival is the fact that the wealthy whites have no solidarity with the rest of the white population, indeed they throw us under the wheels of the bus every chance they get to get a few more dollars. They forget there are more important things than money, such as leaving behind a future for generations yet to come. Indeed, young whites today and those yet unborn have at best a dark and brutal future, if not no future at all in part because of rich whites selling out middle-class and poor whites. It&rsquo;s bad enough we are surrounded by hostile ethnic groups that want us dead or replaced, but it&rsquo;s even worse when some of our own are also our enemies because they are put simply race-traitors.</p>

<p>No, it&rsquo;s not too much for me to understand. Either you have &#8220;minority&#8221; districts, or you distribute the &#8220;minority&#8221; vote among predominantly white districts which might otherwise have a conservative-leaning majority.</p>
<p>BTW, the fact that a district possibly has a &#8220;strange&#8221; shape on a map does not mean that it is a gerrymandered district. If you get maps which show population distribution you get a different picture of what you have to do to draw up districts.</p>
<p>What gerrymandering means, more than anything, else, is devising districts to favor one political party at the expense of depriving voters of the possibility of electing representatives who represent them. Minority districts do not do that, and neither do the district that surround minority districts.</p>
<p>The practice of dividing the minority vote to create more Democratic districts was a sad chapter in American political history, and one for which the Democrats are rightly held responsible. The Republican were right to resist this, and they are wrong to flip-flop on the issue.</p>
<p>Unless you propose devising a way to deprive minorities of representation entirely, you must be on one side or the other on this issue. I don&rsquo;t see where the middle ground is. </p>
