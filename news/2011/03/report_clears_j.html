			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Krissah Thompson, Washington Post, March 29, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>After reviewing thousands of pages of internal e-mails and notes and conducting 44 interviews with department staff members, the [Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)] reported that &#8220;department attorneys did not commit professional misconduct or exercise poor judgment&#8221; and that the voter-intimidation case against the Panthers was dismissed on &#8220;a good faith assessment of the law&#8221; and &#8220;not influenced by the race of the defendants.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In a statement, Smith [Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.)], who chairs the House Judiciary Committee and is expected to hold hearings on whether the department is politicized, said the review  &mdash;  which was limited to the actions of attorneys in the case  &mdash;  &#8220;did not address the Civil Rights Division&rsquo;s misguided policy of using racial considerations when determining whether to enforce voting rights laws. The Division should protect the voting rights of all Americans, regardless of race, gender, religion or political affiliation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An investigation by Justice&rsquo;s inspector general is ongoing.<br>

		<p>Is anybody really surprized of the outcome of this? Did Eric &#8220;my people&#8221; Holder help with this report? Any sane person could see that the actions of the panthers were wrong. To me this FURTHER proves that they are biased against White Americans! They might have unknowingly given Lamar Smith some more ammo.</p>

		<p>OF COURSE they cleared the DOJ!!!  We couldn&rsquo;t have the TRUTH be told here, now could we?  Because if it WAS told, then that would clear the way for every white person and organization who had been discriminated against to sue for justice - and get it, if the BP case was used as a precedent.  Ha - who&rsquo;s kidding who here??</p>

		<p>DOJ investiagates and clears the DOJ. This is afterall the first colored pres and his colored AG who called the new Black Panthers &#8220;my people&#8221; and avocated white babies being murdered too? <br>
Clearly a conflict of interest. <br>
What will happen when Obama loses in 2012? Riots? Burnings? Murders? Assaults? </p>
<p>Better call out the fire hoses police dogs and 60s Alabama cops &hellip; Todays cops have been emasculated.</p>

		<p>From the first, Civil Rights has meant, in practice, the advancement of non-whites at the expense of whites. Now the march is complete, no wonder the agency in charge has exonerated itself. </p>
<p>The affect of Rep. Smith&rsquo;s inquiry is yet to be seen, but judging from Rep. King&rsquo;s hearings on radical Islam, it will likely be tepid. Still, talk of de-jure equality for whites must precede the de-facto state; and both must be in force before we can shake the thrall of &#8220;Civil Rights&#8221;, and do away with consideration for the rights of our enemies.</p>

		<p>ACORN investigated themselves too and found nothing amiss. So did the global warming kooks. I guess that settles it.</p>

		<p>The Washington Post is basically a government organ on this one. Krissah Thompson is an excellent example of what William McGowan described in &#8220;Coloring The News.&#8221; She&rsquo;s a professional African-American. By that I mean she&rsquo;s an African-American, hired to cover African-American lawmakers, because she is an African-American. In other words, she relies on keeping her African-American credentials valid in order to get the access she needs to continue playing that professional role   &mdash;   so she can&rsquo;t report aggressively and independently&hellip; or even acknowledge the fact that when Andrew Brietbart asserted that no one shouted the &#8216;n-word&rsquo; at lawmakers during the Obamacare vote that he had the goods.  </p>

		<p>One of the greatest dangers of democracy is that it encourages counter revolution by population count, rather than good sense.</p>
<p>Nominally, this is &#8216;all okay&rsquo; because those candidates which are previously vetted, selected and groomed for us are controlled by their masters in the higher class business elites.</p>
<p>The problem then becomes: what happens when the sub-dominant population realizes they&rsquo;ve played their hands and can go no further without actually BECOMING THE MAJORITY?</p>
<p>Until we acknowledge the dangerous truth that lies behind that issue, we can ill afford appeasement by A/A allocation of advanced percentile employment to an undercapable race group.</p>
<p>We are NOT all equal, mentally, morally or physically.  It _is_ genetic.  And unless you change what it means to be black by overlaying white group behaviors as genotype changes, there will never be safety for the decent people in the company of a physically more demanding, bullyish, secondary race.</p>
<p>Bluntly: discrimination saved us.  False egalitarianism will destroy us.  Because we are NOT the same.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t mean to be flip, but how is this different from what we&rsquo;ve got now? Just instinct here, but   &mdash;   like whites   &mdash;   I suspect African Americans are on the whole a lot fatter, and a lot older than they were in the late 1960s, or even the early 1990s. </p>
<p>Maybe there will be an uptick in assaults on whites   &mdash;   which, granted, have continued at a ferocious rate during the Obama presidency   &mdash;   and some election day disturbances, but why would it be worse than what we&rsquo;ve got now? <br>

<p>Can someone please explain this &#8216;civil rights?&rsquo; I hear the phrase &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; used by The Ministry of State Media all of the time. The nearest I can make out is that it means <b>Anti White</b>.</p>

		<p>How very nice that the Justice Department is able to CLEAR ITSELF of wrondoing.</p>
<p>Perhaps Charles Manson should be afforded the opportunity to clear himself of any wrongdoing in the Sharon Tate murders.  As expensive as our legal system is to operate, this sort of approach could save the taxpayers a bundle!</p>
