<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>&#8220;Why no video of looters in Japan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s prime minister calls the 9.0 earthquake and the following tsunami the greatest crisis in Japan since World War II. Ten thousand people are feared dead. Millions are without power, and millions sleep outdoors in cold weather. But we haven&rsquo;t seen looting. So I posted this question on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Race is not an issue,&#8221; Mike replied. &#8220;Third World countries like Haiti loot due to poverty. Japan is like America, an economic superpower. Plain and simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poverty equals crime&#8221; is the standard &#8220;plain and simple&#8221; explanation, especially to the left. The analysis contains holes big enough to drive a Hummer through.</p>
<p>In the &#8220;economic superpower&#8221; called America, we see widespread looting following natural disasters, as well as during power blackouts, &#8220;civil unrest&#8221; and basketball team victory celebrations. If we attribute this to American poverty, what about Japanese poverty?</p>
<p>&#8220;Japan Tries to Face Up to Growing Poverty Problem,&#8221; read the headline of a 2010 New York Times article. Here are excerpts:</p>
<p>&#8220;After years of economic stagnation and widening income disparities, this once proudly egalitarian nation is belatedly waking up to the fact that it has a large and growing number of poor people. The Labor Ministry&rsquo;s disclosure in October that almost one in six Japanese, or 20 million people, lived in poverty in 2007 stunned the nation and ignited a debate over possible remedies that has raged ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many Japanese, who cling to the popular myth that their nation is uniformly middle class, were further shocked to see that Japan&rsquo;s poverty rate, at 15.7 percent, was close to the &hellip; 17.1 percent in the United States, whose glaring social inequalities have long been viewed with scorn and pity here&hellip; .  </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>If Japan&rsquo;s percentage of people living below the poverty line is about the same as ours, and if poverty causes crime, as Mike suggests, why isn&rsquo;t the crime rate in Japan about the same as ours?</p>
<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown in the 1960s became one of the most impoverished areas in California. Public policy professors James Q. Wilson and Richard Hernstein wrote: &#8220;One neighborhood in San Francisco had the lowest income, the highest unemployment rate, the highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 per year, the least educational attainment, the highest tuberculosis rate and the highest proportion of substandard housing&hellip; .   That neighborhood was called Chinatown. Yet, in 1965, there were only five persons of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two low-income areas outside of Boston  &mdash;  South Boston and Roxbury  &mdash;  were featured several years ago in U.S. News &amp; World Report. They had similar socio-economic profiles: high levels of unemployment; the same percentage of children born to single-parent households; and the same percentage of people living in public housing. But the violent crime rate in Roxbury, predominately black, was four times higher than that of South Boston, predominately white.</p>
<p>Culture and values explain why some countries and some communities experience crime, while others do not. This explains why many students from Asian countries outperform equally &#8220;disadvantaged&#8221; black and brown students from the same &#8220;underperforming&#8221; inner-city government schools.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Culture and values explain why in Los Angeles, a city with a 46 percent Hispanic population and a 10 percentage Asian population, one sees no Latinos or Asians holding up &#8220;Will Work for Food&#8221; signs. When South Korea played for soccer&rsquo;s 2010 World Cup, the Los Angeles Korean community received permits to view games on big-screen monitors in the streets near Koreatown. The police said the streets were more trash-free after the games than before.</p>
<p>Culture and values are not set in stone. They can and do change for the better  &mdash;  especially when we accept responsibility and stop blaming bad behavior on poverty. Plain and simple.</p>

		<p> Mr. Elder is spot-on. Culture and values play a huge part in how a particular ethnic group or nation behaves at a time of great disasters. East Asians not only tend to have IQs among the highest in the world, but they are greatly influenced by the Confucian Ethic, which teaches striving for success, respecting one&rsquo;s elders, obeying legitimate authority, etc.</p>
<p> On the other hand, in the case of American blacks, we have taught them for many years that they were &#8220;victims,&#8221; that they were &#8220;mistreated&#8221; by &#8220;the man,&#8221; that they are &#8220;entitled&#8221; to reparations, lowered standards (except in professional sports, of course)to benefit them, and other such making-it-up-to-them actions by the White folks.</p>
<p> As a result, while the blacks want to live in the United States and take advantage of all the good things that are available to them just by being American, they reserve the right to be scornful of what the country stands for, and to take what they want, in the apparent belief that ultimately they are stealing from &#8220;Whitey&#8221; and thus that makes it OK.</p>
<p> In the case of Haiti, of course the blacks there were slaves at one time, and they finally rose up and drove their French-speaking version of Whitey into the sea. Having achieved &#8220;independence,&#8221; they&rsquo;ve done nothing with it in 207 years except make their country a basket case. It&rsquo;s hardly surprising that they looted after their earthquake, as their country had little infrastructure, governmental coherence, or anything else that makes up a viable society. </p>

		<p> I am forced to agree since I grew up really poor and have never been arrested for a crime more serious than an unpaid traffic ticket. I always figured that it would be more profitable to work than to steal as the time served would more than likely not be worth the money gained.</p>

		<p>People of all races sustain a sense of identity continuum by identifying their sense of consciousness as a &#8216;living will&rsquo;.  </p>
<p>Despite the fact that at least 70% of your life is performed on instinctive autopilot and remembered with less accuracy than a cuttlefish responding to colors.  Do you remember tying your shoes two weeks ago?  Eating breakfast last month?  The make and model of the car that cut you off in rush hour, 497 days ago?</p>
<p>Of course not.  Because our complex, intuitive and brilliant (even if also tragic or disappointing) moments that make us feel most certain of ourselves as a list of more permanent/memorable accomplishments are but few, linked together amongst a mosaic of oh-that hours, days and years.</p>
<p>Those simple behaviors are what make us biologically human.  And they are genetic.  Now let&rsquo;s say that some people are more possessed of specific genetic autopilot behaviors than others.  And you set them in a complex environment where the only things that are of social value are those which do not reflect their innate behavioral traits.</p>
<p>That is where denial of genetic differences is going to, always, lead to misapprehensions of conditional enablement as prejudice or racism.  Because that existence is not necessarily less cognizant in the moment.  It can be joyous and happy and highly self-aware.</p>
<p>But it will never see the deeper factors in play, it will be as though they don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
<p>And the fact that they do have relevance will seem like something coming out of nowhere as an &#8216;unfair&rsquo; modification of that simple awareness of existence.  As when you cut your finger on a book for the first time as a child and suddenly paper seemed so incredibly unreal as an agency of little weight or stiffness but immense sharpness and burning pain.  </p>
<p>I often think that the only way we will ever get through to the less social cohesive as intellectually capable that there really is more to life than what they are (gleefully) missing out on, is to somehow preemptive render them able to break time up into finer segments so that that continuum of instinct is not itself a biologically sustainable as a want-get construct.</p>
<p>And as a greater comprehension of and experimental emphasis upon those same genetics are what will get us there, so too will it become necessary to create more complex scenario modeled edutainments which absorb the reality of the viewer and trigger or imprint that awareness of greater topology in the moment than is immediately visible.</p>
<p>The problem is that I don&rsquo;t see any real benefit to this process to higher IQ population groups because while such genomic therapies are undoubtely likely to raise our own IQs higher as well, creating economic competition without overcoming a native repugnance at physiological mergence is a bad idea.</p>

<p>Really? As I recall looting was abundant after Katrina. It it was not just &#8220;the necessities&#8221; that was taken! recall seeing expensive shoes, clothes, alcohol,video games and large screen tvs being stolen. Who steals a large screen tv when in a serious crisis and you have no power?</p>

<p>Japan never even used to have ANY unemployment. Maybe underemployment but almost NO unemployment. NOT NOW. And the problem as in the U.S. is only going to get worse, with regard to both poverty and unemployment. What once was, is no more, both in the U.S. and Japan.</p>

		<p>Japan is a mono-racial country, for one thing.  They have an identical shared cultural background, for another.  They all agree on what is acceptable conduct and what isn&rsquo;t; and, they have moral values that make looting unthinkable.  Exactly the opposite of   &mdash;   well, you know who&hellip;.</p>

		<p>One very, very obvious reason for a racial group to be NOT in perpetual poverty is the quality of its genes.  It takes a certain quality of genes to understand how to make society work, how to govern, the abstract concept of money, how to interact with another in a civilized matter, how to constructively solve social problems, the concept of holding down a job and going to work until one can retire, not to reproduce unless one can provide for the offspring without depending on welfare, wealth is saved to pass from one generation to the next, a cohesive family unit with a father and mother, mutual respect among parents to serve as role models for their off springs, etc.  The black race and some Hispanics have a very difficult time functioning among themselves and with others due to a lower level of genes.  The deficiencies are inherent so they can be overcome?  It is anyone&rsquo;s guess. So far no, as shown by the billions wasted and still counting in trying to educate the blacks and Hispanics in this country by affirmative action, Head Start, Race to the Top, etc., etc.  Without white generosity, the blacks in this country will quickly revert back to their lowest nominator as shown in Africa and Haiti.  Anyone, who thinks otherwise, is deluding themselves.  This perpetual throwing vast tax dollars at a problem that cannot be solve by money needs to stop.  This country (taxpayer) is bankrupted.     </p>

		<p>Considering Japan is a country and nation that has taught it&rsquo;s people for thousands of years to be mindful of the collective good over the gain of the individual, this is a &#8220;no-duh&#8221; moment.</p>
<p>With black on black crime the individual takes precedent over the good of the collective (I can&rsquo;t believe I just said that).  They even have &#8220;Japanese Only&#8221; stores in Paris, France!</p>

&#8220;No looting reported.&#8221; The Japanese govt. is expert at hiding unpleasant truths.</p>
<p>Maybe there is some, maybe there is none, maybe there is a lot but we won&rsquo;t hear anything but &#8220;no looting.&#8221;</p>

<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown in the 1960s became one of the most impoverished areas in California. Public policy professors James Q. Wilson and Richard Hernstein wrote: &ldquo;One neighborhood in San Francisco had the lowest income, the highest unemployment rate, the highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 per year, the least educational attainment, the highest tuberculosis rate and the highest proportion of substandard housing&hellip; . That neighborhood was called Chinatown. Yet, in 1965, there were only five persons of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translation &#8220;lowest REPORTED income&#8221;   &#8220;highest unreported, and untaxed  employment.&#8221;  As for the crime rate? It was quite high.  The usual white collar tong extortion of businesses and property owners, 400 percent shylocking, illegal gambling, murder of gamblers who welshed on their debts. this is  found in any Chinatown in the world.  Beginning in 1965 and even earlier with illegal immigration we received thousands of young common street criminal hoodlums shipped over by the Tongs of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>All these 25 year olds arrived with valid birth certificates and passports declaring them to be 15 so that they would be under the Juvenile rather than the adult courts when arrested for their numerous murders.</p>
<p>As well as the cultural constraints against victims reporting crimes, the young Hong Kong  hoodlums simply murdered those who dared report crimes.</p>
<p>As for the &#8220;poverty&#8221;  The public defenders office and the indigent criminal defense panel got so sick of defending Chinese criminals on the taxpayers dime both organizations instituted a policy of investigating the finances of the Chinese criminals who pled poverty to get free legal help.</p>
<p>In most instances it was found that either the criminals themselves or their families owned houses, apartment houses, sweatshops, restaurants, illegal gambling and brothel clubs and could well afford to pay for their legal defense.</p>
<p>Then there was the widespread immigration fraud of the false son.  A family living in the USA legally would claim their long lost son wanted to rejoin the family.  Due to the chain immigration laws all these &#8220;sons&#8221; came to the United States.</p>
<p>Of course they weren&rsquo;t relatives at all.  In many cases the families who took in these Hong Kong mafioso were coerced into it under pain of death.  But of course Chinese cultural constraints prevented them from reporting this to the authorities.</p>

		<p>It is better to define the problem as one of &#8220;culture&#8221; rather than &#8220;race&#8221;. Being called a &#8220;culturist&#8221; doesn&rsquo;t sound that bad now does it?

		<p><i>&ldquo;Poverty equals crime&rdquo; is the standard &ldquo;plain and simple&rdquo; explanation, especially to the left.</i></p>
<p>They claim that poverty causes crime, simply because they see a lot of crime where a lot of (apparent) poverty is.  So simpleton leftists come up with a shibboleth and spout it endlessly.  They ignore the many impoverished areas that have low crime stats.  Mainly because most of those are white, and if they called attention to them, they would also be undermining their own racial egalitarianism.</p>
<p>The reality is not so much that poverty causes crime, it&rsquo;s that crime causes poverty.  Crime causing poverty is an axiom that allows for impoverished but low-crime areas.  Poverty causing crime cannot.</p>
<p>President Obama actually agrees that crime causes poverty:</p>

		<p>Poverty is not excuse.  Poverty does not cause the kind of endemic  crime that is seen in every black &#8220;community&#8221; in America.   It&rsquo;s the blacks causing the crime because they are apparently compelled to engage in it by their DNA. </p>

<p>This is obvious nonsense. When you&rsquo;re a victim of both a tsunami and and earthquake and you lose your home, your possessions and your job, then you instantly become &#8220;poor.&#8221; You have nothing left but your basic nature. There are no class distinctions left.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that leftist explanations always tend to strip human beings of their autonomous free will. This is so they can be more easily controlled.</p>

		<p>Have you seen the news footage of Japanese arriving in American airports?  I bet the same situation is happening in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain and France of plane after plane filled with Japanese being dumped on white soil.  News reports also state Japanese are rushing to get passports to get out of Japan.  For all the talk about how different Japanese/ East Asians are from black people there are many similarities.  Japanese are fleeing to white countries like Haitians did after the earthquake there in 2010 but unlike Haitians who were plucked away by white do-gooders, the Japanese have the ability to travel anywhere on their own.  Have you noticed when major events strike non-white countries like the fighting in Libya, Haitian earthquake, Japanese earthquake/tsnami/nuclear disasters that they are used by the citizens to move to white locations?  We have watched for seven days now the buffoonery of the Japanese government.  People in affected areas have had to fend for themselves without water, food, proper clothes and blankets.  And this is with relative calm.  Remember back to Hurricane Katrina, relief supplies by the government arrived within four days and that is with black people shooting at rescue helicopters, setting fires to buildings, looting and shooting police officers.  At the beginning of this crisis news personalities said the Japanese were the best at this and that, now they don&rsquo;t say that after being in Japan.</p>
<p>Here is a group of articles about the 1995 Kobe earthquake.  The first article is must read.  Ironically, it&rsquo;s written by Glen FUKUSHIMA, the same name as the troubled nuclear plant.  What Fukushima stated back in 1995 is happening once again.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op2.html</a><br>
&#8220;Meanwhile, eyewitness accounts unfiltered by the Japanese mass media (through phone calls, letters, and visits) painted a less rosy picture of arguments, fistfights, looting, price-gouging, hoarding of merchandise, and other conflicts one would expect in most societies struck by such massive destruction and temporary loss of legal order. Whether or not encouraged by the authorities, Japanese journalists engaged in considerable wishful thinking by reporting the Japanese response to this disaster as uniformly characterized by docility, obedience, and resignation.&#8221;</p>
<p>NHK, the Japanese news outlet that provides much of the coverage of these disasters, is owned by the Japanese government.</p>

		<p>Some basic facts to explain the lack of looting by Japanese, and the looting by blacks that we see in America:</p>
<p>In Japan the police are very strict.  Looters would very likely be arrested.  Conviction rates in Japanese courts are well over 90%.  There is no jury system in Japan.  <br>
To be arrested is shameful for Japanese, not only for themselves but for their families as well.  Japanese prisons are harsh.</p>
<p>Looters in America are rarely arrested.  For most young black males an arrest is nothing to be ashamed of, even a source of pride.  For many young blacks, prison is a right of passage.<br>
Police in America stand by and watch black looters.  Conviction rates in U.S. courts are low.  Black juries are loathe to convict blacks.  Blacks lack impulse control, are rarely business owners, and harbor resentment toward businesses in the neighborhoods where they &#8220;stay.&#8221;</p>

		<p>San Francisco&rsquo;s Chinatown in the 1960s became one of the most impoverished areas in California. Public policy professors James Q. Wilson and Richard Hernstein wrote: &ldquo;One neighborhood in San Francisco had the lowest income, the highest unemployment rate, the highest proportion of families with incomes under $4,000 per year, the least educational attainment, the highest tuberculosis rate and the highest proportion of substandard housing&hellip; . That neighborhood was called Chinatown. Yet, in 1965, there were only five persons of Chinese ancestry committed to prison in the entire state of California.&rdquo;<br>

The longer a racial group has practiced civilization the more civilized it is likely to be. This is because agriculture and urban living exert different population pressures than a hunter gatherer existence. <br>

		<p>&ldquo;Poverty equals crime&rdquo;<br>
As a Euro-American who was raised in a poor household, I can tell you this is nonsense.<br>
My family has never been wealthy, but crime is unheard of within our blood. Many anti-racists claim that the crime of blacks is caused by their poverty, yet they completely ignore poor whites that behave and don&rsquo;t use their poor earnings as an excuse to rape or kill whomever they like! In our neighborhood, we lived side by side with poor blacks, and the difference in our behavior was extraordinary. While they were out &ldquo;talking&rdquo;, (more like yelling) and causing trouble (including harassing whites) we were typically inside studying (homeschooled) or working in the yard. <br>
What people normally consider &ldquo;white trash&rdquo; is not typically, what you have to worry about when you are going out to your car or walking down a street at night. &ldquo;White trash&rdquo; may be very rural, but they are friendly and don&rsquo;t behave like animals. Areas that are &ldquo;white trash&rdquo; often have virtually no crime, yet blacks have crime wherever they go.<br>
I resent nothing more than being associated with those people simply because we earn roughly the same, yet nature has dictated that we are too different for association.</p>

		<p>I believe Japan allows very limited immigration. The Japanese are one people of common ancestory. Ancestory is very important in their culture. They were a formidable enemy in WWII because of their unified culture. Likewise they are surviving the current crisis with dignity and strength. Japan is clear evidence supporting the falsehood of &#8220;diversity&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Of course, in white communities there is very little if any looting after disasters.  Who can imagine roaming outlaw bands of whites, whether in cities, suburbs, or rural areas, burglarizing, raping, and shooting up their own communities?  It would be much like the circumstances in Japan, with civilians behaving in an orderly fashion and assisting one another.  Yet the left-wing MSM is beating the bushes down to the dirt to find some instance of looting behavior on the island.  Where, normally, the leftists would support any non-white group, it&rsquo;s too important to them to try to prove that blacks are just like everyone else.  These efforts are some of the most disgraceful antics they&rsquo;ve done yet.</p>

		<p>This spring season there WILL be flooding in the upper mid-west.  Homes will be ruined and electrical power will be lost for thousands.  It is all but guaranteed.  It will not be the first time for many of these folks.  Very few of them are &#8220;well off.&#8221;  In fact, by definition, many of them live below the poverty line.  There will be ZERO looting.  NONE.  Why?  The race, whoops sorry, the culture of the resisidents will not permit it.  Complete stangers within this culture will offer each other support, food, aid, labor, and virtually anything they can to help their fellow citizen within this culture get back on their feet.  The culture of this area is also known for pulling themselves up by the bootstraps after tragedy.  In fact, many of them will need to have their arms twisted just to recieve anything resembling charity. To say that poverty causes crime is a giant slap in the face of every citizen who will not loot, rape, or pillage because his culture&rsquo;s morals, values, and ethics simply does not permit it.  Poverty does not cause crime.  A culture&rsquo;s morals and values or lack there of certainly can.  To say that all cultures would behave the same in the face of tragedy is absolutley absurd.</p>

		<p>I dont know if this is true or not, but my old man told me many times that there were exactly zero Japanese Americans on welfare during the great Depression. He went to high school with a lot of them in the 1930s. He was one of the very few white Americans that wasnt predjudiced against the Japanese in the 1940s.All of his Japanese classmates went to detention camps in the 1940s.</p>

		<p>I am a professional problem solver who helps communities rebuild after disasters such as Katrina in Louisiania and Gustav in Texas. The difference was like night and day between the two Areas .New Orleans a black community ran by black leaders was rife with corruption and incompetence which resulted in the middle class black community trying to replace their black mayor with a white politician in the hopes of getting something done. Mayor Nagin was only able to get elected for a second term by a very slim margin which he accomplished by bringing back as many welfare recipients as he could to vote for him which resulted in his city having the highest murder rate in America two years in a row there after. Galveston a mostly white community had no problems with crime after Gustav hit and the community was hands on involved in helping each other clean up the mess.I was in great demand in New Orleans but not needed at all in Galveston. </p>
