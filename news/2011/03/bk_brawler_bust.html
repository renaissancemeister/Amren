<p>The Smoking Gun, March 24, 2011</p>

</div> 


<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bikini-clad Alabama woman [Kimesa Smith] was arrested Saturday night on a misdemeanor battery charge after she had a violent meltdown over a Whopper Jr. and fries at a beachfront Burger King in Panama City Beach, Florida.</p>
<p>As seen below, Smith&rsquo;s antics were videotaped by a fellow diner who uploaded his video to the Internet (and, while filming the melee, exclaimed &#8220;This is the best spring break ever.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Smith, 31, argued with Burger King employees before jumping atop the front counter, where she swung at workers and threw a large plastic jug at them (the jug apparently was used to collect charitable donations).</p>
<p>Smith, a Montgomery, Alabama resident, also allegedly pulled the hair of a fast food worker and threw other items at employees. She was joined in these pursuits by several acquaintances, none of whom were charged.</p>
<p>According to a Panama City Beach Police Department report, Smith tried to pull away after being handcuffed. &#8220;Take your damn hands off me, you can&rsquo;t touch me,&#8221; said Smith. While in custody, she &#8220;continued screaming and yelling&#8221; at a cop and a Burger King employee who identified her for officers.</p>
<p>In an interview, Smith said that the confrontation began after she complained to workers about the tardy delivery of the Whopper Jr. and french fries she had ordered. {snip}</p>
<p>After waiting 20 minutes for the items, Smith said she flung the bag of food at workers with whom she had quarreled. Smith also copped to, among other things, throwing another customer&rsquo;s drink at wokers, pulling the manager&rsquo;s hair, and throwing the coin jug.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Describing herself as a &#8220;first time spring breaker,&#8221; Smith, a mother of four, said she had traveled Friday to Florida with friends and three of her children, the youngest of which is two and has cerebral palsy. In anticipation of a night of drinking, Smith {snip} said she went to the Burger King to &#8220;get something in my stomach.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Smith said that Burger King employees bear some responsibility for the altercation. &#8220;When I walked in they had no smiles on their faces. We weren&rsquo;t treated fairly,&#8221; she said. Having herself previously worked at McDonald&rsquo;s and Church&rsquo;s Chicken, Smith added, &#8220;I know how to greet my customers.&#8221;</p>
