<h1>State Monitor Orders Asbury&rsquo;s Barack Obama School Closed</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Nancy Shields, Asbury Park Press, March. 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The century-old Bangs Avenue School .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. renamed for President Barack Obama just a year ago .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. will be closed as a neighborhood school this summer, largely because of a steep slide in the district&rsquo;s total enrollment the past decade.</p>
<p>Bruce N. Rodman, the state-appointed monitor who oversees the district&rsquo;s finances, Thursday ordered that elementary students be reassigned to the city&rsquo;s two other elementary schools as of July 1.</p>
<p>According to a plan presented at a community meeting Monday night, all kindergarten-through-fourth-grade students living west of Comstock Street would go to Bradley Elementary School at 1100 Third Ave., and those east of Comstock would attend Thurgood Marshall Elementary at 600 Monroe Ave.</p>
<p>Fifth-graders would be moved to the middle school.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The fiscal monitor had indicated some action was imminent after Superintendent of Schools Denise Lowe could not get the Board of Education&rsquo;s backing Wednesday night for an alternative plan to create two pre-kindergarten-to-third-grade learning centers at two elementary schools and send all fourth- and fifth-graders to the third school, thereby keeping all three schools open.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Rodman said in a letter to district officials that he concluded the closing of the Obama school to be the best option. He cited a 35 percent drop in enrollment the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Lowe reported at the community meeting that enrollment had dropped from 2,783 eight years ago to 2,063 in October 2010, and was now under 1,900 students.¹4 </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The district plans to keep the Obama name as it uses the school building in a different way.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s generally in poor taste to name a building after a sitting or living figure. It&rsquo;s best to wait until they pass before their legacy can truly be assessed. </p>

		<p><i>The century-old Bangs Avenue School &hellip; renamed for President Barack Obama just a year ago &hellip; will be closed</i></p>
<p>Well, Boo Hoo HOO!! </p>
<p>And, just like its namesake, this school is a failure!  And, like its namesake, mired in fiscal mismanagement.</p>
<p>When achievement test scores for NJ were released in the newspapers, Barack Obama Elementary School was the ONLY school in the state not included in the report. Great Schools does not list BHO Elementary. The records for this school are sealed.</p>
<p><i>The district plans to keep the Obama name as it uses the school building in a different way.</i></p>
<p>Maybe this would be a good place to put the Obama Presidential Library or a miniature golf course.</p>

<p>If this closed school building is larger than the school district&rsquo;s central office building, then look for the administration to go on an expansion binge and move into Obama Central.</p>

		<p>Would I be too cynical to think that the school changed its name in a desperate effort to prevent closure due to poor standards and declining rolls?</p>
<p>Seems fitting somehow.</p>

		<p>Oh, so prophetic: The Obama machine isn&rsquo;t going anywhere. The parallels are worth chuckling over.</p>

<p>In fact, I thought it was THE LAW (or at least established custom) in the USA. </p>
<p>(Unlike dictatorships and monarchies where pictures and glorifications of the ruler are seen everywhere.)</p>
