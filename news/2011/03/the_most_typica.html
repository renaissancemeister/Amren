			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maressa Brown, The Stir (blog), March 6, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Who would you guess is the most typical human face on the planet? Does that face looks like yours? Unless you&rsquo;re a 28-year-old Han Chinese man, the answer is NO. That&rsquo;s what <cite>National Geographic</cite> proved as part of its series on the human race called &#8220;Population 7 billion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Research determined that a 28-year-old Han Chinese man is really the most typical person on the planet. There are 9 MILLION people on the planet who fit that description. Wowzers! The magazine was able to create this composite photograph with pictures of nearly 190,000 men of those 9 mil.</p>
<p>The researchers determined that in 20 years, though, the most typical person will be from India.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how this is possible, since India is crowded enough already, and India is not even attempting to expand into Africa, unlike the Chinese. India already has third-world conditions throughout a large part of the country, and a massive increase in the population is not going to help matters any.</p>

<p>There are more Chinese in the world than any other people.  It does not matter how many Chinese or Indians there are, White Europeans will still be running things, inventing things and discovering everything.  If there were only one white male in an Earth of 8 Billion humans, the white guy would be King.</p>

		<p>Actually, I would have guessed that from just the composition of the library crowd who, every morning, show up for &#8216;free&rsquo; (for them) English language training with up to three paid instructors and an average class size of only about 15-20 people, here in the library where I write this.</p>
<p>Of course there is also an armor-glass encased &#8216;Immigration Office&rsquo; just next door in the Atrium too (I kid you not).</p>
<p>And whenever they stroll by the rest of us peons these people have nothing but hard eyes and haughty looks as they go back from &#8216;practice English&rsquo; to whatever East Asian tongue is current this week.</p>
<p>Only a socialist rag like National Geographic would seek to celebrate such conquering mono-ethnism as &#8216;diversity&rsquo; as has not only _overrun_ their own nation to a state of perpetual poverty, enforced negative eugenics and totalitarian resource control but yes, now seeks to export itself as &#8216;the face of change&rsquo; to it&rsquo;s newest locusting point.</p>
<p>The Mexicans still have the most babies in hand, belly and stroller (and next to the blacks, the least clue as to what quiet in a library is about) but the Chinese are not far behind and they start out 6,000 miles further away&hellip;</p>
<p>Whites made this world.  Now we are told we must lose it because &#8216;we take too much&rsquo;.  Which is the inverse of saying that the wealthy classes pay the most taxes because they are in a 70% bracket.  Yeah, right.  And they form 10% of the population compared to the rest of us mere-mortal 20%ers.</p>
<p>95% of the globes population growth comes from the third world.  China included.  That means that 95% of the &#8216;takers&rsquo; are going to be financially poor, genetically bereft and have only a breeding strategy to sustain our culture, when we are gone.</p>
<p>Because the powers that be have decided we don&rsquo;t deserve a mono-ethnic homeland, like every other race on the planet gets.</p>

<p>The Kudzu plant from China has taken over the South Eastern part of the United States. The Chinese Mitten crab has taken over the waters along United States and Europe. Why would the Chinese people be any different, especially when the US and Europe provides more benefits for them than their own people.</p>

		<p>I actually had an idea for a Jeaprody style game show where an asian person is brought out and three contestants have to guess which nation of the orient that person comes from. Of course there would be questions about the country itself, its cusine and fiannly some of its history before the answer is finally put to the test. The contestans would also have to guess based on the appearnace of the person alone as the show went on. The show would be called &#8220;Who is Hu?&#8221; and would feature spinoffs involving Latin Americans, Africans and Europeans. What do you think?</p>

		<p>Of course the cultural genocide will continue,  whoever pulls the strings wants European faces to be part of history. Unless of course white people wake up and take the last place we have left as their own . I am sick of haughty Asian peasants making my life hard in a country my ancestors built.</p>

		<p>Is that Margaret Cho&rsquo;s mother?  Kidding aside, East Asians are a high breeding population like most non-white groups.  They have the same perspective on space, resources and quality of life that keeps them breeding even in bad conditions like having no income or home.  China for 2,000 years had a famine almost every year because of overpopulation.  A study a couple years ago found men with haplogroup O, which is the major haplogroup of Chinese and other East Asians, suffer from low sperm count.  Even with low sperm count East Asians still produce populations much larger than white ones.  Germany and Japan are the same size geographically yet Japan has a population that is 130 million compared to Germany&rsquo;s 80.  America&rsquo;s white population is 220 million compared to China&rsquo;s population of 1.8 billion even though both countries are the same size.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t know how (the Indians will be most populous), since India is crowded enough already&#8221;</p>
<p>The National Geographic editors are predicting the end of nationalism and borders, and are projecting their vision of a future world where the most aggressive breeders have unfettered rights to migrate to Europe and North America. </p>

		<p>Actually I think this will be a boon for white people in those parts of the world where they are challenged by delusional Leftists espousing Multiculturalism. Nothing like a dose of reality. When the fact that ethnocentrism is the norm in the world and is an unchallenged political belief in both China and India the cat is out of the bag.<br>
And the battle for white preservation will be engaged. I think we may very will win that battle, on our turf, because the issue will be survival of North America in a world where we will be outnumbered and not at all sympathetically treated. Will there be Affirmative Action and lavish, or even not lavish, welfare programs in the new limited, if not stunted, version of America?<br>
Probably not. Things will go Darwinian, not because of a right wing cabal of neo-Nazis but because there will be no alternative.   </p>

What do you mean, man?<br>
INDIA IS EXPANDING INTO EUROPE AND THE AMERICAS. They have an offical policy of taking over the world via immigration. Their prime minister proudly said so a few years back. Their goal is not to revive the pesthole that their disease ridden overcrowded country is&hellip;it is to take over the developed nations peacefully, and make those places into cozy pestholes.<br>

<p>Uh, if you will read my original comment more carefully, you will see that I said expanding into Africa. Obviously, I believe that the Africans will be more tractable and easily pushed aside than I believe whites will be in the long run.</p>

		<p>Agree with Tim.<br>
The Indians like to trade and merchandize themselves in places such as Africa. Only the Chinese have the will and the ethics ( by which I don&rsquo;t mean the Christian ethics ) to implement a policy of &#8220;lebensraum&#8221; in Africa, to take over and collectivize agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to their State&rsquo;s needs. They will be able to sell this as &#8220;saving the world&#8221; because in all likelihood it will appear to be so, since the Africans cannot feed themselves and in the meantime are sitting on and wasting a very large and fertile area that could feed billions if properly tended to. So, the Africans will have to go. How that will happen will probably be worked out in an advanced microbiological laboratory in China.</p>
