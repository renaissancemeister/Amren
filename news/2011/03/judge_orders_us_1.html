<h1>Judge Orders Use of Islamic Law in Tampa Lawsuit over Mosque Leadership</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>William R. Levesque, St. Petersburg Times, March 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The question of what law applies in any Florida courtroom usually comes down to two choices: federal or state.</p>
<p>But Hillsborough Circuit Judge Richard Nielsen is being attacked by conservative bloggers after he ruled in a lawsuit March 3 that, to resolve one crucial issue in the case, he will consult a different source.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case,&#8221; the judge wrote, &#8220;will proceed under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nielsen said he will decide in a lawsuit against a local mosque, the Islamic Education Center of Tampa, whether the parties in the litigation properly followed the teachings of the Koran in obtaining an arbitration decision from an Islamic scholar.</p>
<p>The suit was filed by several men who say they were improperly ousted as trustees in 2002. The dispute may decide who controls $2.2 million the center received from the state after some of its land was used in a road project.</p>
<p>But attorney Paul Thanasides last week appealed Nielson&rsquo;s decision with the 2nd District Court of Appeal, saying religion has no place in a secular court.</p>
<p>His client: the mosque.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mosque believes wholeheartedly in the Koran and its teachings,&#8221; Thanasides said Monday. &#8220;They certainly follow Islamic law in connection with their spiritual endeavors. But with respect to secular endeavors, they believe Florida law should apply in Florida courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The judge&rsquo;s ruling comes as conservative lawmakers in Florida and around the nation are increasingly discussing legislation to ban or curtail the use of Islamic law, sometimes called sharia law, in U.S. courts.</p>
<p>Two Florida Republicans, Sen. Alan Hays and Rep. Larry Metz, this month announced legislation to prevent Islamic law, or any foreign legal code, from being applied in state courts.</p>
<p>The Tampa case is drawing attention from some who cite it as proof judges are improperly using foreign law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Florida has joined the march towards Sharia,&#8221; a writer on the Constitution Club blog said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others are less certain, including Neelofer Syed, a Tampa immigration lawyer who is a guest lecturer on Islamic law at Stetson University College of Law.</p>
<p>The mosque, she said, is incorporated under the laws of Florida and so is ruled by state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the judge&rsquo;s ruling is flawed,&#8221; Syed said. &#8220;If you live in a country, you are subject to that country&rsquo;s laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In an appeal of the judge&rsquo;s decision, Thanasides wrote, &#8220;The First Amendment restricts courts&rsquo; authority to review, interpret and apply religious law because these actions interfere with a party&rsquo;s right to choose, free from state involvement, the religious dogma it will follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge said he would use Islamic law to decide only the legitimacy of arbitration.</p>
<p>&#8220;What law would we be applying (at) trial?&#8221; Thanasides asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That trial would be civil law,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;Florida law.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Our judicial system is just as corrupt as the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch.  It has nothing to do with right and wrong.  Get use to it.  Things will get worse as the wheels of multiculturalism roll happily along&hellip; </p>
<p>This judge should be sent packing.  Immediately.  He&rsquo;s unfit for employment no matter what his trade.<br>

<p>American jurisprudence arose from British common law, not Middle East sharia law. How hard is that for this judge to understand?</p>

		<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, several states have or are in the process of passing laws which prohibit Sharia Law from being used in its public jurisprudence.  Now we see why they&rsquo;re doing that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m gonna take a wild guess here and suggest that the &#8220;land&#8221; was given to the mosque by the state or some other idiotic group for free &#8220;majani&#8221; or free of charge in Arabic and THEN! the state bought it back and paid the hostile invaders (or worse, stOOpid black converts) for it. Of course, I could be wrong.</p>

		<p>Pfff! Sharia belongs in US courts only in situations like this, where Sharia motivated the actors who entered a court-resolved dispute. Those who would prevent the court from considering Sharia, would prevent the court from considering the full context of a contractual agreement.</p>

		<p>So ya like Sharia law, do ya, judge?  Well, then, why don&rsquo;t we who are Americans apply it to YOU for your stupid decision here, and simply separate your questionable capo from your irrelevant corpus?  It&rsquo;d set a marvelous precedent in this country for any other judges who may be under the misapprehension that it&rsquo;s acceptable to proceed in their courtrooms under any other laws but those of the United States of America!</p>

		<p>Civil arbitration under sharia law - that´s what a kadhi is for.<br>
(Which system can very well exist side-by-side with Western law, as shown in large parts of the former Turkish realm; the kadhi is generally perceived as quicker and cheaper :) So, if the litigants feel the need for civil court, they aren´t good Muslims anyway (and they know their case is weak).<br>
Item, if the judge thinks the law he is (hopefully) competent in is not applicable in this case, he should have recused himself.</p>

		<p>If Islamic law is successfully used in a Florida court in one case, there&rsquo;s no telling what it will lead to. Islamic law calls for the stoning of adulteresses, forced marriage of children, and it condemns Christianity. If other foreign laws were used in American courts when the case concerned members of their respective ethnic groups, the laws of China, Cuba, and any number of African countries could be next.  </p>

		<p>The court is applying Islamic law in the same sense that it applies course of dealing among merchants.  The purpose is to determine whether the actions taken by the parties complied with the agreement.  Here, the agreed principles are governed by Islamic Law.  There is a long tradition of courts applying foreign law in appropriate circumstances.  Everybody chillax.</p>

		<p>And so it has begun. The first brick has been lain in building a shariah nation. The foundation was set when a muslim was elected to Congress and had his swearing in photo in using the koran. It will only get worse. Hopefully this cancer will be proven benign, but we have to be prepared for a long battle with the malignancy known as Islam. </p>

		<p>Catholics are forbidden to get divorced.  Do we see Catholic bishops lobbying the domestic relations Judges forbidding them to grant secular divorces to Catholics?  No. So why are muslims allowed to do this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sharia law is religious law. Whatever happened to seperation of church and state?&#8221;- Lucas</p>
<p>Neither gentlman knows their history. ENGLISH Common law arose from the implementation of Justinian&rsquo;s Law Code in the Roman Empire, which were derive from the ECUMENICAL COUNCILS tht were overt religious law of the Eastern Roman Empire, and Anglo-Saxon CHURCH law for the native Saxons BEFORE the Norman Papal troops won in 1066. </p>
<p>Separation of Church and State is a misnomer, as has been documented by countless books, videos, and audios ever since ONE Judge fallaciously tried to divorce the Christian, European COVENANTAL Nature of American Jurisprudence from her overtly RELIGIOUS Basis!</p>
<p>As Drs, Rushdoony and North said, fifty years ago, &#8216;It&rsquo;s not a case of religion or NO religion- it&rsquo;s ALWAYS a case of WHICH RELIGION.&#8221;</p>
<p>We better return to our forefather&rsquo;s Christian Faith, or we ARE going to be under Sharia Law. Misericordie, DOMINE!</p>
