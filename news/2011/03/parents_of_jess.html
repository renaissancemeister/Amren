			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Michael Sheridan, Daily News, March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Jesse Bender was believed to be a runaway, then possibly a victim of a child predator, in a series of false reports made by members of her family, police say. </p>
<p>A 13-year-old girl reported missing by her parents was really trying to escape an arranged marriage in Pakistan, police said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Jessie Bender&rsquo;s folks told authorities last month their daughter ran off because she didn&rsquo;t want to go on a two-month family trip to her step-father&rsquo;s native country. They then falsely claimed she was abducted by someone she met on Facebook, officials said.</p>
<p>However, after weeks of investigating leads that wrangled the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Office and police departments nationwide, authorities say it was all a lie.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>
Police soon discovered that another family member had helped the young teen hide out in Apple Valley, about 30 miles from her hometown of Hesperia in Southern California, to avoid becoming a Pakistani man&rsquo;s bride.</p>
<p>Bender, as well as her three siblings, were taken into child protective custody while authorities decide whether to recommend filing charges against her family, San Bernardino County sheriff&rsquo;s spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The parents&rsquo; claim that she had been kidnapped sparked a nationwide investigation, involving both local and federal agencies. {snip}</p>

		<p>The mother should find herself inside the thick walls of a Federal penitentiary.  The step-dad should be arrested as well, and deported back to Pakistan.  No more travel to the US, in fact, the whole country should be banned from coming here.</p>
<p>This, along with the story of the Border Patrol agent who was killed when the beanbags were shot, shows mainstream Americans how backward our immigration policy has become.  We are literally losing our nation, and yet no one does anything about it.</p>

		<p>This is an old formula that even Charles Dickens portrayed in stories and W.T. Stead was moved to incite government policy reform in 19th century England.  White children, especially females have for centuries been the victims of plots like this one.  Ironically today it is assisted by other female relatives. In the case of Ukrainian, Russian and Moldovan sex slaves, they are often recruited by older women and even friends, who promise them jobs in the West.</p>
<p>Both these &#8220;parents&#8221; deserve the most severe prosecution available.  If it is not a punishment that includes at least four decades in prison without parole, it will be far too light.  What can anyone say about a parent who would do this to their daughter?</p>

		<p>It looks pretty obvious that the girl didn&rsquo;t inherit any of the mother&rsquo;s &#8216;good&rsquo; looks.  LOL</p>
<p>The father probably made a financial deal for the match.  I personally know of an Indian man who paid 20,000 to a family to marry their daughter (from Pakistan) and bring her over here.  He was like 25 years older than her.  When she got over here and got her green card, she falsely accused him of domestic violence and the family attempted to extort him.</p>
<p>There is nothing but bad news from that part of the world.</p>

<p>This famous quotation is attributed to Genghis Khan, &#8220;The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy, to drive him before you, to see his cities reduced to ashes, to see those who love him shrouded in tears, and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last part is the most important. The marauding horsemen of the Khans raped the women, leaving a trail of brown-eyed and dark haired descendants across slavic Russia which can still be seen today.</p>
<p>This girl was sold not just by her step-father, but by her government which opened the gates to the barbarians.   </p>

		<p>In the Muslim world, this is a &#8220;dog bites man&#8221;  type story.</p>
<p>I had groups of Muslims literally weeping onto my doorstep because their 15-year-old daughter &#8220;was missing, could have been murdered,&#8221; etc. etc.</p>
<p>Turns out she had run away from an arranged marriage to someone 4 times her age back in the home country, and they were trying to track her down through my neighbor, who had to refuse to answer the door for weeks on end to avoid them.</p>
<p>The tears were real though.</p>
<p>They stood to lose thousands of dollars if the sale of their daughter to some ugly old brute fell through.</p>

		<p>When I saw this reported originally in the news, it was covered as &#8220;girl&#8221; ran away from home. When you read the rest of the story, it is much more clear. And the racial angle is so obvious. Probably marriage not only to a Paki man, but an elderly Pakistani man at that. And forced conversion to Islam too. And that marriage arranged with dowry? The man pays a large bride price to the &#8220;father&#8221; and mother.</p>
<p>And ask yourself this. What white American woman and mother, even one like this, would ever tolerate being married to a Pakistani man? This marriage has to be a sham marriage of some sort?</p>

		<p>I wonder how much money the step-father was planning to get for selling this poor girl?  A pretty blue-eyed white virgin would be worth a lot in Pakistan - I wouldn&rsquo;t even be surprised if this man married the mother to get access to her beautiful daughter and the other kids. </p>

<p>Most ALL muslim men. I personally know 18 and 19 year old Kuwaiti girls that already have had 3 or more kids put in them and are divorced with their MUCH older &#8220;X husband&#8221; already on another  13 or 14 year old &#8220;wife&#8221; These young, and usually very pretty, girls know no different and would get away if they could, but those of us that know Kuwait and Saudi laws, KNOW that is not possible without the very real possibility of being murdered.</p>

		<p>People who engage in interracial marriage tend to be dysfunctional, and this case is a perfect example. The mother not only married a Pakistani, but wanted to transport her child to Pakistan for forced marriage. In other words, she wanted her daughter to be transported to a strange foreign country and raped. What kind of a mother would do such a thing? The daughter must have been terrified. Had it been successful, the same thing would have probably happened to the younger children, too.</p>

		<p>One of the most dangerous things to be is a step daughter in a Muslim family. Thankfully this girl had family that was looking out for her and she was able to escape a horrible fate but unfortunately this is not always the case. Muslims see family ties very differently than we do and if you are not a blood relative then you have a very different standing. In one blended family situation both the mom and dad had a child from other relationships plus several children together. As the two older kids grew up and entered the teen years- in spite of being raised since toddler years as brother and sister- they were told that since they were not blood related to each other they had to be in full Islamic dress and gender separation around each other. To resolve this situation the girl was offered in marriage at age 12 to a 22 year old man. This was one of the final straws for me and I left Islam right after that. </p>

		<p>If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, there have been similar situations which have resulted in so-called honor killings when a daughter refused to cooperate with a coerced marriage.  Jesse Bender did well to flee, as her life may well have been in danger.  Islamic culture is unspeakably brutal with regard women and children.</p>
<p>The US needs to wake up to the dangers of Islam.  Mohammedism (falsely called Islam) gets away with far too much by portraying itself as just another religion.  In reality it is a dangerous geopolitical movement with a religious component.  In this sense it poses a unique threat to civilized culture.  When you strip away Mohammedism&rsquo;s religious facade, you are left with a collectivist political philosophy that is not really so different from Stalinist communism. It is almost as if Stalin or Mao had blended a religious system into their political philosophy in order to use it a weapon against the countries that believe in religious freedom.</p>
<p>Getting back to the story, where&rsquo;s the biological father?  Judging just from the pictures, the daughter&rsquo;s physiognomy indicates some level of intelligence.  The mother, on the other hand, has a empty look about her.  (There is also the added evidence that the mother demonstrated a profound lack of judgment by marrying the Pakistani.)    Miss Bender must have gotten that somewhere.</p>

		<p>Who comes up with all these new names for old crimes?<br>
In this case The Fake Arranged Marriage was little more than a thinly veiled ploy to sell a child into Slavery. In this case Sexual Slavery and Even Worse if that is possible?<br>
The crimes of this FAUX mother /father should earn them both many years in a new cozy prison cell. But it won&rsquo;t, he isn&rsquo;t white so he has rights beyond belief and the mother if thats what you want to call her will claim he forced her to agree.</p>

		<p>Children have a right to a certain amount of unconditional support from their parents.</p>
<p>One thing in particular the parents are responsible to do is provide for them a sufficiently comfortable standard of living even if they choose not to be married to someone. </p>
<p>Another thing in particular is safety from rape.</p>
<p>If a girl wants to be married to some old guy from pakistan she should be informed of the dangers.</p>
