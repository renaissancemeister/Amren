<h1>Thugs Terrorizing Bronx Mail Carriers, Striking at Least Four Times</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Barry Paddock, Daily News (New York), March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A team of muggers is targeting postal carriers in the Bronx, police said Monday.</p>
<p>The team has struck at least four times, investigators believe. In each incident a group of men threatened the mail carriers with a weapon or threw them to the ground, then made off with mail, cops said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Police released a sketch yesterday of a suspect in the most recent incident. He is 18 to 22 years old, 5-feet-6 and 175 pounds with black hair. He was wearing a dark jacket in the incidents.</p>

		<p>Absoultley no mention of these crimes out here in Califronia. I see the newspapers out there are just as good at describing criminals as the liberal rags out here. How long can the liberal MSM cover-up the fact that the diversity utopia is impolding in their faces? Dark days for America ahead. Be aware and prepare my friends.</p>

		<p>Robbing the mail was big in Los Angeles in the 1980s and 1990s. Seven L.A. post offices were hit during Christmas 1984. It got so bad on the streets that armed postal inspectors often went along with carriers on their routes; the USPS stopped sending welfare checks by mail in L.A. County in 1995. Arming lone carriers isn&rsquo;t the answer but having a second person (an armed plain-clothes agent) riding shotgun would help. I&rsquo;d be willing to pay .50 cents a letter to finance it. And of course, you&rsquo;d only need it in urban areas.<br>

&#8220;Police released a sketch yesterday of a suspect in the most recent incident. He is 18 to 22 years old, 5-feet-6 and 175 pounds with black hair. He was wearing a dark jacket in the incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just a guess, but I would say the perp was probably Japanese. Or maybe an Eskimo. (sarcasm off)</p>
<p>In my area the media refuses to identify the race of most perps. Still you can usually guess the perp&rsquo;s race by other clues, like location of the crime, type of crime, etc. In addition, MOST violent crimes here are commited by blacks. And that, IMO, is the reason the media refuses to identify perps by race. To protect the black race. They dont want White America to know the truth about black criminality. </p>

		<p>Of course there is no other description of race, ethnicity.  They include dark hair, but not even brown eyes because that would tell you that they are probably a darker ethnicity or race.  It would not let enough people assume that it might have been a white person.  </p>
<p>I highly doubt that it was a few Czechs with dark hair and blue eyes, though.</p>
<p>At this point in our country they do not even care about catching them.  It is more important in the eyes of the liberals to make sure no one has a negative thought about a minority than protect other people.  In their eyes racism is worse than muggings, robberies, murders, or rapes.    </p>

		<p>&#8220;Police believe a group of several men was behind all the assaults. They released a sketch of a suspect in the most recent incident, described to investigators as a Black man between 18 and 22-years-old, about 5&rsquo;6″ and weighing around 175 lbs.&#8221;</p>

Call the reporter and ask why race wasn&rsquo;t mentioned. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll tell you that &#8220;How would that information help you? You aren&rsquo;t out there looking for the suspect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, unless you are law enforcement, you aren&rsquo;t allowed to be on the lookout for dangerous criminals.  Leave it to the pros.  Nothing to see here. Move along.</p>
<p>But really, we all know that the lib. media just wants to squelch anything that might permit a virulent outbreak of White racism, bigotry, prejudice, discrimination, intolerance, and hate, such as being reminded that the blacks just can&rsquo;t stop living into our worst stereotypes for them.  </p>
<p>No reality allowed! It&rsquo;s too dangerous. Dangerous discoveries must be managed with the best interests of the community and in inclusive ways that reflect our universally held values.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reality rages.</p>
<p>In time like these, racism really is the best option. Instinct is survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Sir, that in this enlightened age I am bold enough to confess, that we are generally men of untaught feelings; that instead of casting away all our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable degree, and, to take more shame to ourselves, we cherish them because they are prejudices; and the longer they have lasted, and the more generally they have prevailed, the more we cherish them. We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason; because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages. Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice, and to leave nothing but the naked reason; because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection which will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, sceptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man&rsquo;s virtue his habit; and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anytime race is not mentioned, almost everyone will assume the perps are black.  They might be Hispanic or Arabic, but blacks will get the blame by default since they commit many more crimes.  Of course, if the suspects are white, the headlines will scream the fact.<br>
And we all know about the non-mention by the MSM of notorious, heinous crimes that all internet users know well.  My husband watches the cable news channels all day and claims that he&rsquo;s heard absolutely nothing about the gang rape in Cleveland, TX!  And of course he knew nothing about the Wichita Massacre or Knoxville Horror until I told him.</p>

<p>So black thugs are mugging black and hispanic affirmative action government employees.  We should care?</p>

Because race, height, weight, sexual preference, IQ, and all other identifiers being seen as discrimination, the news media will now report all criminal suspects as either hominids or mammals; unless they are white, then they will be described as neo-Nazi goose-stepping swastika heads. </p>

		<p>There was a time, long ago, when criminals were afraid of attacking postal employees, especially letter carriers. The Feds would come down on them like a metric ton of bricks, and they would get no help from the locals who depended on the mail for checks and communication. Today with Obama and the internet, the situation has become much different.</p>
