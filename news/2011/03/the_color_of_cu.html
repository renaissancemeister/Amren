<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>While we wait for the state&rsquo;s budget situation to get even worse, it&rsquo;s worth remembering who&rsquo;s going to be most affected by all the coming service cuts.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/50768709/The-Color-of-Cuts"><big>This new report</big></a> from the Washington Community Action Network is a strong reminder that, as the report says, the type of cuts the legislature is considering  &mdash;  cuts to Basic Health, the Disability Lifeline, maternity support, education funding, and higher education assistance  &mdash;  will fall &#8220;disproportionately on people of color.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>Reject cuts to services that disproportionately impact communities of color and raise new revenue to promote equity and prosperity for all Washington residents.</blockquote>

		<p>Seattle is only 8% black in total, and over half of all homicides there are committed by blacks.  For some strange reason, every time I post that fact in a comment they censor it over there at The Stranger.</p>
<p>Blacks committed at least 14 of the 28 homicides in Seattle in 2008.</p>
<p>Blacks committed at least 12 of the 21 homicides in Seattle in 2008.</p>
<p>Blacks committed at least 7 of the 17 homicides in Seattle in 2008 (five of the 17 were committed by a crazy asian woman who killed her family).</p>

		<p>&#8220;Raise new revenue.&#8221;  Meaning tax increases, meaning us unimportant people of non-color have to pay for it.</p>
<p>The proper question isn&rsquo;t which races will be hurt by budget cuts, but which races disproportionately benefit from Washington State&rsquo;s welfare system and which races disproportionally pay for it.  &#8220;Equity,&#8221; as this group seems to want, will only come by making these cuts and not increasing taxes in order to avoid them.  Or rather, that will be the first baby step to equity.</p>

		<p>News flash to Eli Sanders: Most of the people on the government dole are &#8220;people of color&#8221; so of course they will be the most affected by cuts in the myriad of taxpayer provided (aka free) services.. And by the way, white is a color too and poor white people will be just as affected as poor people of other colors.<br>
 <br>
Perhaps if we spent more time getting people of all colors to help themselves rather than being helpless victims in need of government assitance we would all have a better society. But then again without a perpetual supply of victims, the Democratic party would cease to exist and liberal propaganda would fall on deaf ears.</p>

		<p> When they say &#8220;people of color,&#8221; they always mean &#8220;blacks.&#8221; Asian Americans are also &#8220;people of color&#8221; by the liberal definition, but does anyone think they are who the writer has in mind? No, because they don&rsquo;t feed at the federal trough the way blacks do.</p>
<p> And by the way, would it be OK if budget cuts &#8220;disproportionately affected&#8221; White people? Is it perfectly all right to inconvenience or harm us, but &#8220;verboten&#8221; to do it to &#8220;people of color&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I agree- nobody in charge cares about working class neighborhoods of no color! It is almost as if the appellation &#8220;of color&#8221; makes a neighborhood,community or person automatically worth more. It&rsquo;s as if we are being told- you whites get back to work, don&rsquo;t complain and pay the bills.</p>

		<p><i>&#8220;I vote for any term ending in &ldquo;.. of color&rdquo; as the most infuriating cliche of the new decade. I&rsquo;ll be happy when the PC vanguard decides that it&rsquo;s offensive and taboo, as inevitably seems to happen with any appelation used to describe blacks.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I agree.  But it&rsquo;s interesting to note that &#8220;persons of color&#8221; as a euphemism for &#8220;blacks&#8221; was once considered to be a condescending insult.  Of course, no one knows anything about recent history  &mdash;  or indeed, any factual history at all  &mdash;  these days, so the irony passes unnoticed.</p>
<p>In the end, Whiners Of Color will always find <i>something</i> to blubber and complain about.<br>

		<p>If the Whiners of Color are worried about the service cuts that will result from budget shortfalls, perhaps - just perhaps - they should take the measures necessary to reduce their dependency on these services. </p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t complicated stuff - if one has the intellect of an adult.</p>
