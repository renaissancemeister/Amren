<h1>Obama Says Race a Key Component in Tea Party Protests</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kenneth T. Walsh, U.S. News, March 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<blockquote>
<i>[An excerpt from Kenneth T. Walsh&rsquo;s book </i>Family of Freedom: Presidents and African Americans in the White House.<i>]</i>
</blockquote>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Adding to his woes, in January 2010 the race issue erupted again in an unusual and unexpected way. Democratic Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate majority leader and an Obama ally, was embarrassed because of some racially insensitive comments he had made to John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, the authors of a new book, Game Change, about the Obama campaign. It turned out that Reid had predicted in 2008 that Obama could succeed as an African-American presidential candidate partly because he was &#8220;light-skinned&#8221; and because he didn&rsquo;t speak with a &#8220;Negro dialect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid quickly apologized, and many black leaders, including the president and Attorney General Eric Holder, defended him as a decent man who was not a racist. But Republicans tried to score political points, with party chairman Michael Steele and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, calling on Reid to resign as majority leader. He refused, but the furor showed how race remained just below the surface of American life. Racial polarization was again on the rise. In January 2010, 96 percent of African-Americans approved Obama&rsquo;s job performance, virtually unchanged from his 100-day mark in April 2009. But whites were losing faith in him, with only 44 percent approving his job performance, compared with 62 percent the previous April, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll in January 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>African-Americans&rsquo; views on achieving racial equality also were growing more negative, even though black voters remained in strong support of Obama. According to McInturff [Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster], only 11 percent of blacks said that African-Americans had reached racial equality, down by 9 percentage points in one year, and 32 percent said equality would not be attained in their lifetimes, up by 9 points. Four in ten whites said African-Americans already had reached racial equality, while 31 percent said it would happen soon.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Lincoln and King. On March 12, 2010, President Obama welcomed me into the Oval Office for an interview for this book. {snip}</p>
<p>Obama was in a reflective mood. He began the interview by saying he had been &#8220;fully briefed&#8221; on my topic and was ready for me to &#8220;dive in.&#8221; He proceeded to methodically defend his effort to build a race-neutral administration. &#8220;Americans, since the victories of the civil rights movement, I think, have broadly come to accept the notion that everybody has to be treated equally; everybody has to be treated fairly,&#8221; the president told me. &#8220;And I think that the whole debate about how do you make up for past history creates a complicated wrinkle in that principle of equality.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip} He made clear that he was president of all Americans, not just of African-Americans, and didn&rsquo;t want to be thought of only as a black president, even though he acknowledged that the country had been extremely proud in November 2008 when a majority of voters made history by electing him. He said he wasn&rsquo;t sure how many Americans still saw him &#8220;through the lens of race,&#8221; although he acknowledged that, within the black community, &#8220;there is a great pride that&rsquo;s undeniable,&#8221; and many African-American children &#8220;may feel a special affinity to me as a role model.&#8221; He compared all this with Irish-Catholic Americans who felt enormous pride in John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s election as the first Irish-Catholic president in 1960.</p>
<p>I asked him if he was very conscious of his own race as he conducted the business of the presidency, and his answer was insightful. &#8220;You just don&rsquo;t think about it, you really don&rsquo;t,&#8221; he replied. {snip}</p>
<p>I asked him how much he felt an obligation or responsibility as the first African-American president to advance racial justice and make up for some of the past disparities between blacks and whites. He replied, &#8220;Well, I think that every president should feel an obligation to deal with not only issues of discrimination, but also the legacy of slavery and segregation that has been such a profound part of our history. You know, obviously it&rsquo;s hard for me to engage in a mind experiment and say, well, if I weren&rsquo;t African-American, would I feel less strongly about it or more strongly about it  &mdash;  and I know I feel strongly about it. I do come to this issue with personal experiences that are unlike any previous presidents&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I also think that anybody in this office who cares deeply about the future of the country would be looking and saying to themselves, the population is changing; the future workforce is going to have a lot more African-American and Latino and Asian workers. And if those populations don&rsquo;t feel fully assimilated into the culture, aren&rsquo;t performing at high levels educationally, are caught in cycles of poverty  &mdash;  that that&rsquo;s not good for America&rsquo;s future. And that&rsquo;s certainly how I feel  &mdash;  and I would like to think that any president would feel that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But Obama, in his most candid moments, acknowledged that race was still a problem. In May 2010, he told guests at a private White House dinner that race was probably a key component in the rising opposition to his presidency from conservatives, especially right-wing activists in the anti-incumbent &#8220;Tea Party&#8221; movement that was then surging across the country. Many middle-class and working-class whites felt aggrieved and resentful that the federal government was helping other groups, including bankers, automakers, irresponsible people who had defaulted on their mortgages, and the poor, but wasn&rsquo;t helping them nearly enough, he said.</p>
<p>A guest suggested that when Tea Party activists said they wanted to &#8220;take back&#8221; their country, their real motivation was to stir up anger and anxiety at having a black president, and Obama didn&rsquo;t dispute the idea. He agreed that there was a &#8220;subterranean agenda&#8221; in the anti-Obama movement  &mdash;  a racially biased one  &mdash;  that was unfortunate. But he sadly conceded that there was little he could do about it.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m going to grant Obama the point for the sake of discussion only.  In reality, we all know the consensus ideology of the TPM on race is non-concern at best, egalitarianism on average, and out and outright pandering at worst.  </p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly conceded that there was little he could do about it.&rdquo;  Cue violins, cry me a river.</p>
<p>For, sadly, we still live in the United States of America, where at least legally speaking, white people can still organize against a black politician on the basis of race alone and with the sole motivation of race.  And sadly, Barack Obama is not a dictator, who can wipe out any such opposition, or any opposition at all, with the stroke of an ink pen, nor is he the head of state of a European-style soft tyranny which has made such opposition and organization illegal based on the emotional appeal of &ldquo;hate.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>This is great! But unfortunately further inevitable economic decline is still in WN&rsquo;s long-term interest since the White mainstream doesn&rsquo;t care about their collective interest unless their wealth is under threat like now which is why there&rsquo;s a TP in the first place</p>

		<p>If Native born White Americans allow blacks,foreigners from Kenya and high fertility post-1965 nonwhites to define the terms of the debate, the debate will be completely defined in terms of their racial interests&hellip;and their is a corresponding demonization of legitmate Native Born White American racial interests.</p>
<p>As far as the Tea Partiers go, let&rsquo;s be honest:they are bunch of fools who persist in trying to convince a highly racialized black population and  a rapidly growing and highly racialized post-1965 nonwhite population that is voting in every presidential election to race-replace the White Tea Partiers and Native Born White Americans in general.</p>
<p>The conclusion is obvious:either Native Born White Americans become highly and openly racialized in their politics or they will be race-replaced by high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. Ad in the process of being race-replaced, Native Born White Americans will be violently persecuted by blacks and post-1965 high fertility nonwhites.</p>
<p>The idea that the Tea Partiers are ever going to be able convince blacks and post-1965 nonwhites that they are not racists laughable.</p>
<p>They only way only to fight back is to throw the racist charge back at blacks and post-1965 nonwhites..becuase it is a true claim.</p>
<p>The race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority by high fertility post-1965 nonwhites is not up for debate&hellip;there is no debate..we reject race-replacment&hellip;.this is what we and the White Patriots who speak on our behalf should state loud and clear in their MSM appearances. There is 1)no way to be nice about it and 2) there is no other way to do it.</p>
<p>The ongoing post-1965 race-replacement immigration policy is a hardcore racist policy. It has to be stated just like this. This is what Jared Taylor must start doing&hellip;it will most definitely catch peoples attention..and most importantly, allow the White Patriot movement to define the terms of the &#8220;debate&#8221;.</p>

		<p>If Obama really believes what he is saying, and is not just cynically playing the race card after the press dealt him a handful of race cards to play, then he is as delusional as his buddy Kadaffi.  And he should take the same advice he gave to Kadaffi&hellip;..step down, you&rsquo;ve lost it, you&rsquo;re insane.</p>
<p>The tea party is not mad because &#8220;everybody else&#8221; got something and they didn&rsquo;t.  They are mad because this country is bankrupt from giving everybody everything rather than have them earn it, and they want to &#8220;take back&#8221; the country NOT from a black man, but from a full blown Marxist narcissist and drag it out of Socialism.</p>

		<p>There are always so many unchallenged assumptions in these MSM articles.</p>
<p><i> but the furor showed how race remained just below the surface of American life.</i></p>
<p>They say this as if it&rsquo;s even conceivable that someday race will <i>not</i> be &#8220;just below the surface&#8221; (or flaring into outright hostilities) in <i>any</i> multi-racial society.</p>
<p><i> He proceeded to methodically defend his effort to build a race-neutral administration.</i> </p>
<p>How can he &#8220;defend&#8221; something that doesn&rsquo;t exist (as proven by some of his statements in this very interview)?</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Well, I think that every president should feel an obligation to deal with not only issues of discrimination, but also the legacy of slavery and segregation that has been such a profound part of our history.</i> </p>
<p>Ah yes, that unproven and mythical &#8220;legacy of slavery and segregation.&#8221; Kind of like the unicorn, the very existence of it must never be questioned.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;But I also think that anybody in this office who cares deeply about the future of the country would be looking and saying to themselves, the population is changing; the future workforce is going to have a lot more African-American and Latino and Asian workers.</i></p>
<p>Ah, but <i>why</i> is the population changing? Is it not the direct result of current policies? Is this how you&rsquo;re going to get back at whites for that imaginary &#8220;legacy of slavery and segregation:&#8221; by helping to turn them into a small minority?</p>

		<p>Getting a jump on the race card before 2012.  Obama&rsquo;s sheer craftiness fully illustrates that he&rsquo;s just a radical, liberal white man in a dark suit.  Anyone white who runs against him will be labeled as a racist.  Any black who dares will be a &#8220;Tom&#8221;.  Maybe there&rsquo;s some genius to Obama!<br>

		<p>Individual blacks (Obama, Clarance Thomas, Powell)  don&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p>The problem with large groups of Africans isn&rsquo;t what they do, but what they don&rsquo;t do: maintain a civilization. This is why the problem is only noticeable when their are many of them.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that conditions in Africa are actually normal, it&rsquo;s civilization has to be designed, built, created. </p>

		<p>&#8220;Subterranean agenda?&#8221;  Yeah, right&hellip;  I&rsquo;m a Tea Party member and we don&rsquo;t care WHAT color people are who join our movement, as long as they agree with us politically.  The fact that BO is black (well, half) is incidental; we would fight his policies just as strongly if he was white or any other race.  Subterranean agenda - I think that&rsquo;s what exists in Obama&rsquo;s mind, not in ours.  His subterranean agenda is to get revenge for all the experiences of American blacks that have been negative, and to blame it all on the whites.  That&rsquo;s why he sat in &#8220;that church&#8221; for 20 years (not knowing of course what the minister was saying) - he must have absorbed the radical black viewpoint osmotically&hellip;.</p>

		<p>Although Tea Party activists are quick to jump to their own defense against being labeled &#8216;racist&rsquo;, and show black attendees and speakers in their midst, claim how they go out of their way to help blacks in their personal lives, etc, frankly they are going about this the wrong way. By replying and going on the defense about it, the Tea Partiers are playing a game that gives the libs the upper hand to freely disrupt their activities and lives, slander them, and define the boundaries of their speech and the topics which are okay for discussion, allowing the libs to take anything and everything that the Tea Party brings up for discussion off the table by labeling it as racist in motive.<br>
 <br>
The Tea Party should instead completely ignore the liberal labels and continue to go about their business as usual. If others want to leap to their &#8220;defense&#8221;, then that&rsquo;s okay, but the issues that the Tea Party bring up- Big Government, Government spending, Taxation, Obamacare, etc- are economic issues. </p>
<p>If minority groups act in blatantly race-based ways with racial preference demands and agendas and neither they nor their agendas are labeled racist and removed from discussion, then the label racist has become meaningless, and should not apply for anything that a mostly white group does out of the principles of fairness, especially when that mostly white group does things that do not actually touch the topic of race.</p>

		<p>And what is wrong with a little racism???</p>
<p>I am proud of my White European Heritage. I think White Culture is superior (just look at South Africa after blacks took over). If that makes me a racist, let it be. <br>
I am proud of being a Christian. Is that racist?<br>
I think islam is an evil cult, not a Religion. Is it racist? No, I am simply doing what my ancestors have been doing for the past 1400 years. Opposing evil.<br>
I live in a White neighborhood and send my children to White schools. Is that racist? No, I am just protecting my family and myself and want the best education for my kids.</p>
<p>And yes, I also want my president to be White. In this case it is not his race that bothers me but the fact that he is a communist destroying my Country. Go ahead, call me a racist. I really don&rsquo;t care.<br>
I am sick and tired of Whites constantly being on the defensive apologizing to everyone for living!!!<br>
No more!!! It is time to stand up and fight for our survival. If we don&rsquo;t, the White Race and Culture are finished.<br>

		<p>The Tea party is just an anemic Republican party reform movement that has been taken over by race-replacement enthusiast and war-mongerer Sarah Palin. This is where implicit Whiteness will get ya..you betcha Sarah from Alaska.</p>
<p>Am I the only one here who  watched &#8220;Prophets of Doom&#8221; on History International? Five experts on resource scarcity explaining in great detail just how precarious the situation in America is. Two of the experts I recognized. One was former Hudson River Keeper John Cronin-water scarcity expert- and peak oil popularizer James Kunstler. Since Jared Taylor touched on environmental themes in his Charlotte talk, he should watch the rebroadcast of this two hour special-three or four times-and take notes. This is about the fourth   History Channel show  on the comming ecological and economic collapse of America&hellip;just in the past year! It was very compelling.</p>
<p>This brings me to my next point. The Tea Party is so limited in its vision. And this is the reason for its anemic impact.  If the Tea Party had an expansive vision of race-replacement,post-1965 high fertility nonwhites,eco-sanity themes like the one discussed in &#8220;Prophets of Doom&#8221; and other shows in the series, they wouldn&rsquo;t act like scared little girls every time the race-replacement enthusiasts called them a racist. A White Patriot concerned about the racial survival of the Native Born White Majority-and this is the fundamental issue-would dig in and fight by throwing the racist charge back at the race-replacement enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The White Patriot movement must be the ecology movement&hellip;our long term racial survival requires this&hellip;importing post-1965 nnwhites is incompatible with this&hellip;as is Brimelow&rsquo;s moratorium nonsense.  The Tea Partier&rsquo;s vision is so incredibly limited&hellip;and hiding behind a hanfull of black conservatives to prove that they are not racist..so incredibly stupid.</p>

		<p>Is anybody surprised?</p>
<p>He had already hinted this in interviews by saying &#8220;some of these people don&rsquo;t like what I represent&#8221; as a question directly based on whether the Tea Party protests were based, at least in part, on race.</p>
<p>Notice how he didn&rsquo;t say &#8220;no, it&rsquo;s not about race&#8221; but left the field open to speculation by his vague answer.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a crafty politician&rsquo;s way of saying &#8220;yes, I do think so&#8221;.</p>
<p>And of course, he comes the confirmation. He probably withheld what he thought until the midterms are over. He figures it can&rsquo;t get worse now. And I think he is right. All the republican main contenders are either half-wits or &#8216;republicans&rsquo;(like Mitt Romney).</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also interesting to note that this is the first *openly* hostile president to whites.</p>
<p>Of course, someone like Bill Clinton was too but he was hostile in his indifference, as an indirect way. He might have been hostile in secret but we&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>We do know about Obama now. And forget fightning back. If the black prez uses the race card, any counter-attack will be blown to pieces by a bloodythirsty MSM who are aching to scream &#8220;I told you so!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Still, I didn&rsquo;t think Obama would sink this low.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Many middle-class and working-class whites felt aggrieved and resentful that the federal government was helping other groups, including bankers, automakers, irresponsible people who had defaulted on their mortgages, and the poor, but wasn&rsquo;t helping them nearly enough, he said.&#8221;</p>
<p>What the dimwit can&rsquo;t comprehend, as is true of others of [half] his race, is that whites know they would BE helped if all those other groups he mentioned WEREN&rsquo;T helped using whites&rsquo; tax money. We&rsquo;re TIRED of our money going to bankers, automakers &amp; irresponsible people who defaulted on their mortgages (and many others he failed to mention) making US poor in the process. We&rsquo;re TIRED of being the backbone propping up the rest of the country and the world, and our ability to do that is quickly diminishing. So what then, oh, black Swami?</p>

		<p>True,Red,White and Blue is an example of the insanity of the Tea Partiers that I have posted about. He and his fellow Tea Partiers are being singled out for race-replcement by a highly racialized foreigner from Kenya and he responds with blatherings about &#8220;if you agree with us on economic issues&#8221; your OK with us&hellip;.even if you want to replace us within the borders of America with post-1965 high fertility Hispanics,Muslims,Asians,Africans and Carribeans.</p>
<p>Tom Swift</p>
<p>So, your OK with three Blacks, all of whom are enthusiastic about race-replacing the Native Born White Majority with high fertility post-1965 nonwhites. Obama has been very open about his race-replacement enthusiasm. Colin Powell&rsquo;s public enthusiasm for race-replacing the Native Born White Majority has been well documented over at vdare.com.</p>
<p>The Tea Partiers are really a creepy bunch&hellip;the Tea Party is a politcal movement completely compatible with the race-replacement of the Native Born White Majority. I want nothing to do with the Tea Partiers.</p>
<p>Clarence Thomas-married to a White Woman-is deeply connected to the race-replacement enthusiasts of the Republican Party inner core. Why would you be confortable with some like this?</p>
<p>The only game in town for Native Born White Americans is a Native Born White American Patriot Movement&hellip;either this or race-replacement. </p>

		<p>I agree completely with WhiteEuropeanAmerican. I stopped apologizing for my race long ago. When someone call me a &#8220;racist&#8221;, I simply say &#8220;So&#8221;?. Then they call me a &#8220;hater&#8221;, and I respond that I hate no one, but that I love my people. Then I get the blank stare. Then I ask them to define &#8220;racist&#8221;. That really stumps them. BTW, is there such a thing as a Non-whiteEuropeanAmerican? It&rsquo;s kinda like WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant); I&rsquo;ve never seen a non-white Anglo-Saxon. </p>

		<p>The Tea Party activities are definitely driven by issues that are the exact opposite of minorities that are owed a living, but I certainly lack the X-ray vision of the president and most liberals to see the level of race consciousness in the heart of the Tea Party folks. Policies of white self-interest are at the heart of the Tea Party movement.  </p>

		<p>No surprise, our &#8220;post racial&#8221; president accepts the $PLC&rsquo;s take on the Tea Party.  The Tea Party is against ever bigger and more expensive government in a time of 2 trillion dollar annual deficits.  But since the President is a black man, this is deemed racist.  That is why we should have a white president   &mdash;   not because Dubya was any damn good, but because you can criticize the policies of a white president without being called a racist.</p>
<p>The Tea Party is stupid enough to latch onto Sarah Palin, who is a neocon eager to start new wars.  No country ever balanced its budget in the middle of a war.</p>
<p><i>But I also think that anybody in this office who cares deeply about the future of the country would be looking and saying to themselves, the population is changing; the future workforce is going to have a lot more African-American and Latino and Asian workers. And if those populations don&rsquo;t feel fully assimilated into the culture, aren&rsquo;t performing at high levels educationally, are caught in cycles of poverty &mdash; that that&rsquo;s not good for America&rsquo;s future.</i></p>
<p>The country is changing because of our insane immigration policies.  Instead of stopping immigration, our political masters insist that we must invent some way to raise the intellectual level of an ever increasing number of blacks and Mestizos.  Good luck with that.  The only thing that would work is the one policy that is forbidden   &mdash;   eugenics.  And even that would take many generations to work.</p>

		<p>If anything, race is too small of a component in the Tea Parties. Glenn Beck (the self-appointed leader of the Tea Party movement) probably spent more time at the &#8220;Restoring Honor&#8221; rally praising a Marxist race hustler than praising Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, or even Abraham Lincoln (the one Dead White Man president that is semi-politically correct to lionize, provided his views on black inferiority are ignored).</p>
<p>As for complaining that the tea parties are &#8220;too white&#8221;: So are the ranks of great scientists and inventors. Do you have a car? Thank a white man. Have you ever used antibiotics? Thank a white man. Do you live in a residence with air conditioning? Thank a white man. Do you use a PC? Thank a white man. Do you use anything that required the use of mathematics more advanced than basic algebra and geometry to develop (this includes most technology developed in the last century)? Thank a white man. Have you ever consumed iodized salt (this is a common measure to ward off cretinism)? Thank a white man. Without whites, most of the world would be about as advanced as the Iron Age, and the Chinese would still be thinking of themselves as the finest people in the world for developing block printing and gunpowder (and not much else, considering that they basically went 500 years without advancing by the time Europeans arrived, and seemed perfectly happy to stay that way until forced to do otherwise).</p>

		<p> -he told guests at a private White House dinner that race was probably a key component in the rising opposition to his presidency from conservatives, especially right-wing activists in the anti-incumbent &ldquo;Tea Party&rdquo; movement that was then surging across the country.</p>
<p>So, whats wrong with that? Isn&rsquo;t he a member of the NAACP, and wasn&rsquo;t he a member of the CBC? Isn&rsquo;t race a &#8220;key component&#8221; in those groups? I don&rsquo;t recall THEM cheering for Reagan or the Bushes. </p>

<p>&#8220;I pray it&rsquo;s a cold day in hell before we ever have another black democrat in the White House again doing anything other than vacuuming the carpets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forgive me if I&rsquo;m wrong but it sounds like you wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with a quasi &#8220;conservative&#8221; black Republican pursuing the same &#8220;colorblind&#8221; policies, perhaps in a more discreet way.<br>
