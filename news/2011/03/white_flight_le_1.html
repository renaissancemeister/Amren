<h1>White Flight Leaves System Segregated by Race</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Anna Patty, Sydney Morning Herald, March 10, 2008</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>White students are fleeing public schools, leaving behind those of Aboriginal and Middle Eastern origin, a secret report by high school principals reveals.</p>
<p>The NSW Secondary Principals Council conducted a confidential survey which raises serious concerns about &#8220;white flight&#8221; undermining the public education system and threatening social cohesion. Some teachers and principals have described it as &#8220;de facto apartheid&#8221;.</p>
<p>The findings are backed by research from the University of Western Sydney, which has identified evidence of racial conflict in schools in the wake of the Cronulla riots. It also suggests students of Anglo-European descent are avoiding some schools with students of mainly Asian background.</p>
<p>Not only have some public schools lost enrolments; they have become racially segregated. In pockets of rural and remote NSW, Aboriginal students fill public schools and white students attend Catholic and other private schools in the same town.</p>
<p>Around Sydney, the parents of some Anglo-European students are avoiding what they perceive as predominantly Lebanese, Muslim and Asian schools.</p>
<p>In New England, in towns such as Armidale, white middle-class students are flocking to Catholic and independent schools.</p>
<p>In their report, principals say this is so the students can &#8220;get away from their local school&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is almost certainly white flight from towns in which the public school&rsquo;s enrolment consists increasingly of indigenous students,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;The pattern is repeated in the Sydney region. Based on comments from principals, this most likely consists of flight to avoid Islamic students and communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report, its pages stamped confidential, was based on responses of 163 high school principals, representing a third of the Secondary Principals Council membership. It was presented to the NSW Government after it was completed in February 2006, but has not been released.</p>
<p>Principals in New England said 56 per cent of the Anglo-European students who had left their schools had gone to a nearby Catholic or independent school. In North Sydney, 35 per cent of students who had left the public system went to a nearby private school.</p>
<p>The report shows the percentage of Anglo-European students in public schools has decreased by a third in western NSW, by 42 per cent in North Sydney and 37 per cent in New England.</p>
<p>A University of Western Sydney academic, Carol Reid, has also found that one in four male students surveyed in Sydney&rsquo;s south and west had been involved in ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>She had received anecdotal reports from principals about white students avoiding what were regarded as Asian schools on the North Shore and some selective high schools that had high proportions of Asian students.</p>
<p>Dr Reid, who is the associate head of the school of education, surveyed 350 high school students aged between 14 and 17 in south-western Sydney, after the Cronulla riots of 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;ve been involved in education for 30 years and I&rsquo;ve never seen this polarisation around class, but also around ethnicity and race,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I have discovered is principals are losing the last of their white kids to Catholic schools across the road. A principal in the Middle Eastern part of the city was saying that he had no white kids in his school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m concerned that social cohesion is going to be at risk through this. I see signs of that. You have a lot of segregation going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The survey of principals reports one saying: &#8220;The Asian students are scared off by Lebanese enrolment at our school following the Cronulla riots  &mdash;  we had 18 no-shows on day one in year 11, mostly Asian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m seen as a Muslim school, so I don&rsquo;t attract very many non-Muslims, whether Anglo or not. I&rsquo;ve worked hard to raise the school profile and gradually increase enrolments, but the Muslim label appears to alienate other groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noel Beddoe, a former principal in Narrandera for 20 years who is involved in Aboriginal education, said a &#8220;de facto apartheid&#8221; had developed in some towns in the west and north of NSW, including Mungindi, near Moree, where Aboriginal students attend the public school and whites attend the Catholic school.</p>
<p>Busloads of white students from towns including Boggabilla cross the Queensland border every day to attend a Catholic and public school in Goondiwindi. The same is happening in southern NSW, where students are bypassing Balranald Central School and crossing the border to go to schools in Victoria.</p>
<p>Up to 15 years ago, Boggabilla Central School, near the Queensland border, had a relatively even mix of white and Aboriginal students. The proportion of white students has dropped from around 40 per cent in the early 1990s to 10 to 20 per cent today.</p>
<p>Owen Hasler, the NSW Teachers Federation organiser for the New England region, said: &#8220;There has been a significant movement of white Anglo students away from quite a few of the schools in the New England and Western region. It is clearly evidenced by the numbers and proportion of Aboriginal students in those schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said around 8 per cent of the 1100 students at Gunnedah High School during the 1970s were Aboriginal. That proportion had grown to about 25 per cent of the 600 students now enrolled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public schools are becoming de facto Aboriginal schools,&#8221; Mr Hasler said. &#8220;It appears to be a result of the last 10 to 15 years of funding. We can understand people making the choice to send their kids away to other schools when there is a financial incentive to do so. But is that fair to the kids who want to stay in their own local community?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Reid said policies of the Howard government and the Liberal state government that had strongly supported parental choice in schooling, including de-zoning, had contributed to &#8220;white flight&#8221;.</p>
<p>Parents were no longer restricted to schools close to home and could use generous government subsidies for transport. Boarding school allowances of up to $6396 per child were also available, making it easier for some families to avoid their local school.</p>
<p>The Isolated Parents Association is lobbying to have the $54 million federal government boarding assistance scheme extended to more families in rural and remote areas. It is means-tested and restricted to children of families who live more than 56 kilometres from the nearest government school, or more than 4.5 kilometres from the nearest transport to school.</p>
<p>The association&rsquo;s national president, Roxanne Morrissey, said families who lived near a public school should be supported in their choice of another school that offered a wider curriculum choice.</p>
<p>The NSW Greens MP John Kaye said the State Government spent $443 million a year on a transport scheme that &#8220;encourages travel past local public schools to private schools in other suburbs&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s a recipe for educational segregation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Rick Johnston, director of Catholic schools in the Armidale diocese, said enrolments of Aboriginal students were increasing. In 1985 there were 6557 students in Catholic schools in the Armidale region and of these, 196 were Aboriginal. Last year there were 465 indigenous students out of 5892 students.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am committed to improving education outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe that education is the most important key to breaking the cycle of disadvantage experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharon Cooke, who is employed by the Catholic schools office in Armidale as an Aboriginal education consultant, said there were 25 schools within the diocese that employed 20 Aboriginal education assistants and two Aboriginal language teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are committed to increasing the number of teachers within our schools who are of Aboriginal heritage,&#8221; she said.</p>

		<p>As long as they don&rsquo;t get to the bottom of the real reason for this woeful &#8216;segregation&rsquo;, that whites don&rsquo;t like being harassed and victimized by people of color (or anyone for that matter) and the authorities instead blame the very whites being bullied, or blame WHITE racism (although the REAL racists are so bold now they need not specify white racism, instead choosing simply using the word racism or hate)&hellip; as long as they don&rsquo;t get to the real issue all of their talk about fixing the problem, and this media attention, is only going to make things worse.</p>

		<p>While I suppose there a certain level of perverse satisfaction in seeing another predominately white English-speaking nation now suffering the consequences of attempted racial mixing, it makes one wonder how many more examples of this madness develop before people listen to their racial instincts and senses.</p>
<p>The Japanese don&rsquo;t welcome hordes of racially diverse foreigners.  They like their country the way it is, its values and traditions, its customs and its universal language.</p>
<p>Nationally, diversity is simply a source of disunity and trouble. We were able to tolerate a certain level of national diversity, so long as our immigrants were of mainly northern European stock.  Even the early Italians had adjustment problems, and their cultural departure from earlier European immigrants was relatively minimal. </p>
<p>Today we&rsquo;re being invaded by Mexicans, South Americans, Africans, some Eastern Europeans, few of whom bring anything to the national table except dependency, crime, and dissolution.</p>
<p>Sorry, but that&rsquo;s just the way it is. The starry-eyed lout who dreamed up Obama&rsquo;s inane campaign slogan &#8220;Diversity is our Strength!&#8221; should be tarred, feathered, and stuck on top of the Washington Monument.</p>

		<p>And so it begins.  I remember when smug Euros used to castigate white Americans for this.  Unfortunately for them their elites slavishly follow the American multi-cultural religion and now they&rsquo;re starting to experience the reality of it.  </p>
<p><i>We are committed to increasing the number of teachers within our schools who are of Aboriginal heritage.</i></p>
<p>Oh, Brother!  It brings up an interesting point: private schools are only better because they can keep out the riffraff,  most  don&rsquo;t fundamentally deviate from the Regime&rsquo;s program, particularly its racial program.    </p>

		<p>This is not news to me. I went to school in Australia in the 80s and 90s and since I&rsquo;ve become somewhat racially aware, looking back I realise just how racially segregated the school was. Whites stuck together, Asians stuck together (in their various individual ethnicities - Chinese, Indians, Phillipinos etc), Islanders, and so on. Most got along with each other at the time (other than the usual suspects) but it&rsquo;s striking how obviously the students self-segregated.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine what these schools must look like now, when the racial makeup of the country has diversified in leaps and bounds since even that time. Particularly with these recent massive waves of Chinese, Indian, Middle-Eastern, and even African immigration. But I can certainly picture Whites no longer feeling welcome when certain ethnic groups have grown to such a large extent that they start to exert an overly-dominant presence.</p>

		<p>In America, there were the &#8220;Jim Crow&#8221; laws of the Deep South, that segregated schools.</p>
<p>In Australia, they can&rsquo;t use &#8220;Jim Kookaburra&#8221; laws as an excuse. Why in blazes can&rsquo;t politicians and educators in Australia see that people want to be among their own kind? What&rsquo;s this thing about &#8220;social cohesion&#8221;, anyway? People are more concerned with self-preservation, than social cohesion.</p>

		<p>There are many outstanding and dedicated teachers in the public school system here in NSW and many government run schools have a reputation for excellence, BUT:</p>
<p>1, I have noticed that most politicians send their children to private schools.</p>
<p>2, We sent some of our children to an independent private school, it was like the difference between night and day. Many non-catholics here put their children into the Catholic school system, simply to get them away from the PC and other rot in the public system.</p>
<p>3, We have always lived in a white English speaking area so I don&rsquo;t know the answer to this question, but do these ethnic minorities do much volunteer work for their local school(s), eg. helping in the canteen, helping at fund-raising events, serving on the P&C;, working bees to improve facilities, I suspect not.</p>
<p>4, We now have the disturbing trend of more and more islamic schools being established here, bad news, but they will certainly demand all of their entitlements such as Government subsidies and free travel passes for their pupils. I also hate to think what may be taught in these institutions outside the official curriculum.</p>
<p>5, In NSW you can get your kids into a good school either by paying to go private or choosing to live in a &#8220;good&#8221; location. This should be a fudemental human right. This seems to be a right that the PC do-gooders want to take away from us. The good news is that both sides of politics here are very sensitive to this issue.(The greens just want an open door multicult society with unrestricted immigration) </p>
<p>6, Busing. That sounds like an evil dirty word, like AA, Diversity &amp; Empowerment etc.</p>
<p>7, I notice that at any train staion in Sydney, nearly all schoolkids associate with their own ethnic group.</p>
<p>8, The Cronulla Riots. This was a case of Australians speaking out for their rights, to be able to go to the beach without being harrased by Muslim louts. The good news is that at my local beach there is hardly a Muslim in sight, no medieveil black robes or Muslim youths speeding in their hotted up Skylines &amp; Subarus.</p>
<p>9, I think that some politicians have got the message about the would be Islamic invasion of Oz but they can&rsquo;t say much due to UN and other PC guidelines. But by and large I feel that we have been able to be more outspoken on these issues than our American friends. (And we don&rsquo;t have the black or mexican problems here either)</p>
<p><br/>
White America, speak up before you are destroyed totally.</p>
<p>PS The Australian dollar is now trading at more than parity with the Greenback, Mr BHO will have to stop printing money to pay for immigrant welfare.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t know what the big surprise is here. What did the Aussies expect was going to happen? The truth is Australia never should have abandoned its White Australia immigration policy. Immigration is only a privilege, not a right, and Australia never had anything to apologize for or explain about it.</p>

		<p>I went to a public school in a rural NSW town and can vouch for this. It was probably 80-85% white and the rest were aboriginals, only other non whites were a couple of half philipino&rsquo;s, mail order mums and 65 year old nam vet dads. I still have a few aboriginal friends that turned out alright, not particularly successful but nice people. Only reason they turned out ok is they hung around alot of whites and didnt get dragged down by the abo mob. Most of the abos stick together, and most try to imitate american blacks. The only reason the town is segregated is because the abos absolutely ruin whatever area of town they live in. </p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just the beginning. Here in the US it&rsquo;s too late because the diversity machine is running full bore, and there&rsquo;s not even any discussion about slowing down immigration. The only acceptable talk is to increase it. </p>
<p>I try to look at this issue historically. All people around the world want to go where the whites are due to their overall success. That is what&rsquo;s attracting them.</p>
<p>Here in California we&rsquo;ve already lost the culture war - it&rsquo;s &#8220;fail accompli&#8221; and there&rsquo;s no turning back. Same in many other parts of the US. </p>
<p>I think Australia has a chance though the doors is going to close soon. Hope the people down under make the right decisions. <br/>

		<p>To the poster who thinks Eastern Europeans are in the same category as Mexicans, I have a bone to pick. Eastern Europeans are not Mexicans and these other third world invaders, please remember that. I am of Slavic descent, and I take offense at my ancestors being mentioned in the same breath as Mexicans. Most people there are decent people who are Christians, not Jews, Muslims, mobsters or terrorists if you please. They have a very strong sense of racial, cultural and national identity. My own father left this country a better place than when he found it, and I am doing the same. Huge numbers of Slavs fought and died for this nation, as well as suffered tremendously building this nation, and we are no more happy about the brown, black and yellow invaders than you are. Indeed, my ancestors killed, massacred and drove them  back whenever they got the chance.</p>

<p>Right, so remove people&rsquo;s choice to decide where they want to live. What next? Road blocks? If people liked &#8216;diversity&rsquo; then they wouldn&rsquo;t take up the option to flee it. In fact, Kaye should be PLEASED that these middle class white racists are fleeing. Typical liberal fascist. Don&rsquo;t you see - there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with &#8216;multiculturalism&rsquo; - it&rsquo;s the PEOPLE that are causing all the problems. If they all just did as they were ordered then we&rsquo;d all happy.</p>
<p>These left wing liberals have a moral obligation to lead by example. They need to relocate themselves and their families to the heart of an ethnic ghetto and send their children to the local government schools. We can start with the politicians, academics, journalists and celebrities. They can show us all how it&rsquo;s done.</p>

		<p>Australia is the only western country that actually has a eugenic immigration system, where immigrants perform better at school on average than Australians, and where immigrants commit less crime on average than Australians.</p>
<p>But that isn&rsquo;t enough to make Australian multiculturalism a success.</p>
<p>Aboriginal performance is much worse than African American performance. A significant proportion of Aborigines literally can&rsquo;t count up to 10 (or even to 7, in their languages they don&rsquo;t have any numbers higher than 3, so 6 is called 3 3), and that&rsquo;s just how the far left likes it. Aborigines are not expected to obey white-man&rsquo;s laws, or behavioural norms.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the Muslims, and the black Africans.</p>
<p>Australia is doing better than other Western countries, but it&rsquo;s still slowly disintegrating.</p>
<p>People need to recognise white flight for what it is: ethnic cleansing and genocide against white people. Whenever there is evidence of white flight, whoever caused it should be jailed for genocide.</p>

		<p>In my experience, the initial stages of globalization and diversity in Sydney and Darwin in the late 1990&rsquo;s caused division and social anxiety between whites, aboriginals, muslims, Greeks, and sicilians, based on varying cultural, economic, and racial, pathologies.</p>
<p>At the time, whites in Darwin and Sydney seemed to have wanted a more socialized environment to the extent that open minded yet stationary traditionalists were socially ignored by politically active liberals.</p>
<p>Today the same situation exists but apparently to a far greater degree.<br/>
The liberals continue to resist nationalism although they are hesitant to increase the divide as fast as they did in the late 90&rsquo;s because of the open racial violence perpetrated against whites by blacks.</p>
<p>The traditionalists seemed only to have gained ground by the natural act of resisting violence against them by meeting blacks with the same for the sake of their survival.</p>
<p>A hole opened up by white liberals that continues to endanger the white population while merely being observed by Australia&rsquo;s financial elite.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, Australians will have no choice but to come together for their racial survival even if winning means fermenting a coordinated resistance based on race and intelligence, against  the path of their government.</p>

		<p>Well, apparently the article fails to mention anything about Greeks. hummmm</p>
<p>Greeks are the largest anti-white and non-white demographic in Australia and are well adept as stealing the land of others. </p>
<p>Heck, they stole(or attempted to steal) many of our heroes:<br/>
1)Alexander the Great<br/>
2)Pyrrhus of Epirus<br/>
3)The great Skanderbeg<br/>
4)Kolokotroni</p>
<p>They even stole a part of Epirus from us and want the rest! Cameria is Albanian land!!!!! Greeks need to return to Africa and do the Balkans(and Europe) a big, huge favor.</p>

		<p>One of a parent&rsquo;s prime priorities should be to see that his child doesn&rsquo;t attend a school that&rsquo;s black or brown majority.  It&rsquo;s not just the danger of violence or lack of proper teaching that&rsquo;s a problem.  Last night, I watched a show about Ohio prisons.  Two white (as far as I could tell) prisoners talked and acted like ghetto blacks.  They interacted with black cons in a way that seemed unusual in large prisons.  I&rsquo;ll bet these guys attended public school in some big Ohio city and soaked up the hip-hop culture like a sponge.</p>

		<p>At least we know when the real rubber hits the road that whites are the same everywhere even though they originated from England as a penal colony 200 yrs ago.</p>

		<p>Because &#8221; actions speak louder than words &#8221; as proven by the racist, anti-White Christian (Euro-Stock Western Civilized people) by the hypocritical Marxist, globalists of all ethnic, religious(?) cultural backgrounds. They say every group is &#8221; equal in every aspect of humanity &#8221; but want every non-White, non-Christian aka, non-Western person to leave their own majority culture, immigrate legally(?)or illegally ( alien trespassing,invading hordes) into any and all formerly majority White-Christian countries without any limitations on their quality or quantity over-whelming the creative native culture that created this &#8221; societal paradise &#8221; that these third worlders strongly covet and enabled by the native&rsquo;s treasonous, non-representatives on all levels of unconstitutional, anti-White racist,corrupt governments in any Western country worldwide. Non-Western countries are not pressured nor expected to pay for their own genocide by duplicating the West&rsquo;s own self-destruction.</p>

		<p><b>Aboriginal students fill public schools and white students attend Catholic and other private schools in the same town.</b></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tax season and I&rsquo;m more than a little steamed right now considering that I live in California and am forced to support hoards of lazy, unproductive welfare recipients.</p>
<p>What angers me the most about this situation is the double taxation.  I am compelled, wholly against my will, to support local public schools filled with violent blacks and Mexicans who are taught by Communists to despise my kind, and I must pay heavily to send my own children to a private school to escape these indoctrination centers filled with hateful pests.</p>
<p>Question for my Aussie friends:  Are you allowed to own and/or carry arms?</p>

		<p>All the evidence, every day, from all over the world showing that multiculturalism doesn&rsquo;t work, yet the idiot leadership continues to go down the path of wonderful, liberating diversity. It does wonders against any white guilt which still exists in every non-minority.</p>
<p>Whites just want to go to school like their parents did. They don&rsquo;t want to have to study 24/7 to get all A&rsquo;s like the Asians. They also don&rsquo;t want to school to join a gang, like the Lebanese.</p>

		<p>The experience of anononymous was similiar to mine. I grew up in Dubbo, N.S.W and went to a public school. The only non-white people were the Aboriginals and they glued to each other. They made up about 20-15-10% (?) of the school and all trouble at the school could have been sourced back to them in some way. Once in high school a large group of Aboriginal girls marched into the front office and started harassing teachers. The only other non-white people were a tiny number of Filipinos (maybe about three or four) and one Chinese girl. It was amazing how homogenous we were apart from the Aboriginal-White divide.</p>
<p>Things are no longer the same. While we&rsquo;re still mostly white, it is incredible how many &#8220;diverse&#8221; groups have infilitrated my old hometown in the past three or so years. In 2006 you could go out onto the street and walk around and not see a single Sudanese person, but now you will usually see a group of about five. Public housing ghettos, which used to be predominantly Aboriginal, now have spatterings of Sudanese wandering around them. Why? What is going on? Why are they coming out to rural areas? I have a feeling the government is running a program to get them employed in rural places. Why Sudanese?</p>

		<p>Jack Parsons #22: Here&rsquo;s something for you to consider. No one who is sending their children to a Private School, which needs to be paid for by their own personal funds, should be required to pay School taxes to support a School that their children do not use. </p>
<p>The same should apply for Elderly Couples, whose children have grown, moved, and gotten married, as well as childless couples. </p>
<p>Why are these people paying for Schools that they are not using? </p>
<p>Let the tax burden fall to the minorities that use them. See the Schools fall further into disrepair, or get totally destroyed by the sole occupants of them. </p>
<p>Watch NEA Union member Teacher salaries go into the dumper, as the revenue dries up, for their bloated, unearned compensation, with benefits most of us don&rsquo;t have, and more time off from work than they know what to do with.  </p>
<p>If your children need to use the Public Library for any reason, then either pay for the use of it for the year, or pay as you go. </p>
<p>Having all parents who send their chilren to Private, or Parochial Schools, band together to demand these solutions, is the only way that you will be heard, and taken serously. </p>
<p>Going it alone is not an option, and you cannot relate to those Politicians in power that they will be removed from Office if they do not comply, with just one person, or one family. Strength in numbers will do your talking. </p>

&#8220;In America, there were the &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; laws of the Deep South, that segregated schools.ver</p>
<p>In Australia, they can&rsquo;t use &ldquo;Jim Kookaburra&rdquo; laws as an excuse. Why in blazes can&rsquo;t politicians and educators in Australia see that people want to be among their own kind? What&rsquo;s this thing about &ldquo;social cohesion&rdquo;, anyway? People are more concerned with self-preservation, than social cohesion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soprano Fan,<br/>
Good line about the Kookaburra.LOL!!<br/>
Why can&rsquo;t politicians everywhere realize that!!?? After they&rsquo;ve realized it they should all commit mass Sepuku to atone for what they&rsquo;ve done to their OWN race for the most part.</p>
<p>When Civil War II commences those &#8220;stronzi&#8221; will all run for protection to the people whom they betrayed. </p>
