			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ron Fonger, Flint Journal, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Rosa Parks became the mother of the civil rights movement by refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white man.</p>
<p>But Parks is shown standing  &mdash;  not seated  &mdash;  in a new sculpture that was quietly unveiled Friday at the downtown Flint Mass Transportation Authority bus station.</p>
<p>Sculptor Anthony Frudakis&rsquo; bronze statue depicts Parks in a standing position, wearing glasses, a purse over her shoulder, clutching a pair of gloves. It&rsquo;s a less commonly seen pose than those showing Parks sitting down, refusing to leave her seat, as she did on Dec. 1, 1955.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to show her is sitting in a bus seat  &mdash;  especially (when the sculpture is) in a bus station,&#8221; said John Pryor of Grand Blanc Township. &#8220;(That sitting position) tells everything  &mdash;  the whole story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pryor, 72, said he&rsquo;s looked at many other depictions of Parks, and was among those who waited in line for the opportunity to see her casket after her death in 2005. He said that having Parks seated makes it easier to explain her story to children.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re teaching our African American kids their history,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pryor isn&rsquo;t alone. There were similar questions when a statute of Parks, sculpted by a different artist, was dedicated in Grand Rapids last year, and Frances Gilcreast, president of the Flint branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said she had heard standing-versus-sitting comments even before the statue was unveiled.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Others who saw the sculpture Friday were mixed in opinions of what they saw.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>MTA employee Kay White said she wasn&rsquo;t impressed by what she saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;They kept it in a box for two years and it looks nothing like her,&#8221; White said.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the Rosa Parks statue comes five years after the MTA agreed to contract with the Greater Flint Arts Council to secure and deliver various types of artwork with a civil rights theme as part of a renovation of the bus station.</p>
<p>The sculpture of Parks has been considered the centerpiece of the collection, but even though it was delivered to the bus station nearly two years ago, it had been left in a wood crate until Friday.</p>
<p>MTA and Arts Council officials have said they ran into unexpected delays because of citizen complaints about some of the artwork being placed in restrooms and because some artists weren&rsquo;t able to complete some of the pieces they agreed to.</p>

								<h2><a href="/ar/2005/12/index.html#article2">A Curious Madness</a></h2>
						<p>A curious state of madness descended on the country on October 24, and began to dissipate only by the first week of November. Americans lavished the praise and honor reserved only for supreme heroes on a woman whose sole achievement was to refuse to give up her seat on a bus.</p>
<p>From the moment Rosa Parks died at the age of 92, until she was buried nine days later, virtually every politician and organ of the media competed to see who could heap the most praise on a woman invariably referred to as a &#8220;civil rights icon.&#8221; She became only the 30th person  &mdash;  and the first woman  &mdash;  to lie in state in the Capitol rotunda, where President George Bush laid a wreath. Her casket was accompanied by a military honor guard for memorial services in Washington, before she was buried on November 2 in a seven-hour funeral in Detroit. The President ordered that all flags over federal buildings and bases fly at half mast. It was an astonishing tribute to a woman whose lifetime of achievement began and ended in one afternoon.</p>
<p>The myth that has grown up around Rosa Parks is of an exhausted Birmingham seamstress who, in 1955, was too tired to give up her seat and move to the colored section so a white man could sit down. According to the myth, this spontaneous act sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and launched the civil rights movement. In the miles of column inches that greeted the news of her death, there were only hints of what really happened.</p>
<p>In fact, Parks&rsquo;s decision to keep her seat was carefully planned by the NAACP, for which she had worked for 10 years as a secretary. Her arrest did help start the bus boycott, but she played no role in organizing it. And though the boycott has gone down in folklore as a great blow for freedom, it did not even succeed; it was a court order that integrated Birmingham&rsquo;s buses.</p>
<p>Several black women had already done exactly what Parks later did. They were arrested and charged with minor infractions. Parks&rsquo;s best known predecessor was Claudette Colvin, a 15-year-old high school student who refused to give up her seat on March 2, 1955. She was arrested and taken off the bus kicking and screaming. Police say she was screaming obscenities; she later claimed she was screaming that her constitutional rights were being violated. Not even Miss Colvin&rsquo;s case was the spontaneous act for which Parks is now generally remembered. The girl had been active in the NAACP Youth Council, and had even discussed strategy with Rosa Parks herself.</p>
<p>The NAACP considered basing a desegregation case on the basis of Miss Colvin&rsquo;s arrest but soon decided she was not an attractive plaintiff. She was dark, and many blacks wanted a lighter-skinned spokesman. The NAACP also learned she was several months pregnant by a married man, and discovered her habit of breaking out in volleys of curses. This was not a girl conservative black church-goers would support.</p>
<p>As E.D. Nixon, then a leader of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, explained years later, &#8220;I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win with.&#8221; Rosa Parks was far more promising: &#8220;morally clean, reliable, nobody had nothing on her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NAACP had been planning a bus boycott for years, and was waiting only for the right person to act as figurehead. Far from being an accidental hero, Parks was carefully groomed for her role. A white integrationist, Virginia Durr, had paid for Parks to attend civil rights strategy seminars at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. The school, known to be rife with Communist sympathizers, was under FBI surveillance.</p>
<p>Moreover, Parks&rsquo;s role was strictly limited: keep her seat and hold her tongue. Others swung into action immediately to organize the boycott. The very day she was arrested  &mdash;  it was a Thursday  &mdash;  an English professor at all-black Alabama State College named Jo Ann Robinson stayed up all night mimeographing 35,000 leaflets calling for a one-day bus boycott the following Monday. On Friday, she and her students secretly leafleted elementary and high schools. As part of a coordinated effort, Montgomery&rsquo;s black preachers met and agreed to endorse the Monday boycott from their pulpits, and to hold a mass meeting Monday night at Holt Street Baptist Church to assess the results. That evening, after a surprisingly successful boycott, thousands of blacks crowded into and around the church to hear 26-year-old Martin Luther King give his first public speech. The boycott lasted for more than a year, with both the blacks and the bus company more stubborn than anyone had expected. Blacks organized carpools that even the Citizens Council had to admit operated with &#8220;military precision.&#8221; Parks played no role in any of this.</p>
<p>It was not the boycott that eventually brought integration, but a court case  &mdash;  and one in which Rosa Parks was not even a plaintiff. In Browder v. Gayle  &mdash;  one of the four plaintiffs was foul-mouthed Claudette Colvin  &mdash;  a three-panel district court in Birmingham ruled on June 19, 1956 that segregated buses were as much a violation of the 14th Amendment as segregated schools. The Supreme Court upheld the decision in December. Then, and only then, did Montgomery agree to integrate its buses.</p>
<p>It can be argued, therefore, that the boycott was both a failure and unnecessary. Rosa Parks was a catalyst in organizing what turned into an impressive demonstration of black solidarity, but virtually anyone presentable would have served equally well. Rosa Parks did not risk death. She did not face fire hoses or police dogs. She did not even face humiliation. She knew very well that if she was polite and cooperated with the police she would be treated courteously. She also knew that the NAACP and her white friends would immediately bail her out of jail.</p>
<p>It is impossible, even by the most sympathetic reading, to see Rosa Parks as anything but an unimportant actor in a drama that was not even necessary. Not once, in the intervening 50 years, did she do anything of the slightest importance. Black congressman John Conyers gave her a job in his Detroit office, apparently more out of courtesy than because of her abilities. As she grew older, she mismanaged her finances, and depended on a local church to pay her rent. Eventually, her landlord simply stopped charging.</p>
<p>Rosa Parks has dined out  &mdash;  and become a hero of American history  &mdash;  on the basis of a single half hour of immobility. Surely, never in the history of the world, has so small an act won such praise.</p>
<p>The last few years have been building up to the extraordinary excesses we have just witnessed. In 1996, President William Clinton presented Parks with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 1999, Congress voted her its Gold Medal. These, too, are exalted honors.</p>
<p>Blacks are not likely to complain if whites make a demigod of an unimportant woman, but why do whites bow their heads before such transparent fraud? There is no satisfactory answer. Americans are never happier than when glorifying non-whites who have denounced the alleged sins of whites. The adulation of Rosa Parks is just another chapter in the lemming-like rush to destruction whites everywhere appear to have joined. If a still-majority-white Congress and Senate can vote by acclamation to make Rosa Parks the first woman to lie in state in the rotunda, any act of racial self-mortification is possible.<br>

<p>This is one of those black ideas I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about.</p>
<p>&#8216;Black kids aren&rsquo;t learning black history!&rsquo; which is supposed to explain why they continue to fail.</p>
<p>Give blacks their black history courses and nothing will change. All that will happen is someone will come up with a theory to explain why teaching black history didn&rsquo;t work. Black history wasn&rsquo;t taught right. The wrong black history was taught. White people don&rsquo;t take black history seriously. Black history was taught in the wrong way. Etc.</p>
<p>Someone will propose a &#8216;slave auction&rsquo; and when it&rsquo;s done in class, black children will be traumatized and the lawsuits will be filed.<br>

		<p>We might ask why we do not see a statue being erected to Allan Bakke, or to the unsung women who organized the protests against court-ordered busing, or to the Ricci case plaintiffs. They were fighting against violations of their civil rights. But the current party line consigns to the memory hole White people who struggle for their rights. </p>

<p>You forgot the fact that Rosa was also helped by the white man who asked her to get out of her seat  &mdash;  a reporter (NYT?) that was in on the scam. The whole thing is what is referred to as Soviet agitprop.</p>

		<p>The Rosa Parks effect has rubbed off on Canada.  </p>
<p>Some Canadian activists are attempting to invent a local Rosa Parks, from the story of a black woman who sat in the white section of a theater in 1946. She received a fine.</p>
<p>The purpose today is to stir up some white guilt, which can then be turned into social leverage.</p>

		<p>I think the statue should show her in jail. She did, after all, break the law and was arrested. </p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s somewhat nauseating to realize more than $60,000 went for this travesty. </p>
<p>Only blacks could demand a statue showing another black seated and being honored for refusing to get up off her behind and not see the irony. At least this sculptor did.</p>

		<p>Someone should look at the effect that court case had on public transport. Is catching public transport now a more relaxed, pleasurable, social experience where people can interact with their community in harmony? Is it more financially viable now that it no longer offends black people?</p>

		<p>I lived in the South during this time and the main reason blacks were asked to sit in the rear of the bus had little to do with their color.<br>
Hygiene was not high up the ladder for many people at this time (blacks in particular) and if they weren&rsquo;t at the back of the bus the stench was repulsive.</p>

<p>Interesting little creavate you open here.  It might have something to do with separate drinking fountains, restrooms, seating in various public places, etc.  Having many semi-tropical swamps, the South was right in using some sort of dividing lines in attempting to restrict the spread of Yellow Fever, Malaria, Cholera, Typhoid, TB, other water borne bacterias, etc.  The lack of scrutiny in Public Health due to PC restraints has allowed diseases and threats once considered rare or non-existent to become more common in the U.S.</p>

An authentic black history would reveal how little blacks have contributed to world civilization and American history. It would discuss how cannibalism and human sacrifices were common in Sub Saharan Africa before European colonialism. It would tell how African blacks were complicit in the slave trade and profited from it. It would discuss white flight, not as irrational color prejudice, but as a rational response to black crime whenever blacks move into a white working class neighborhood. </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting.  I remember going to school back in the late 70s and some blacks had a very peculiar dirty sock smell to them. There were also a few blacks on the schoolbus and if I sat behind them little pieces of nappy frizz would fly off their head and up my nose and make me cough.</p>
<p>The only picture I remember of Rosa Parks in the history books was her police mug shot holding up a sign with some numbers on it.  That would be more appropriate.  <br>
