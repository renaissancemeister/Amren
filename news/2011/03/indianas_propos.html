<h1>Indiana&rsquo;s Proposed Immigration Crackdown Draws Fire</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Carrie Ritchie and John Tuohy, Indianapolis Star, March 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Indiana&rsquo;s proposed immigration law  &mdash;  which would be one of the toughest such laws in the nation  &mdash;  took hits Tuesday on two fronts.</p>
<p>Calling Senate Bill 590 a waste of resources, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry announced that he had joined about 2,600 people in signing a petition to encourage state lawmakers to leave immigration reform to the federal government.</p>
<p>Blow two? The Indianapolis Convention &amp; Visitors Association, which also opposes the bill, acknowledged that one convention scheduled for Indianapolis this summer has said it will pull out if the bill passes and that a second said it would no longer hold conventions in Indiana if the bill becomes law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Various education, business and religious leaders were relatively quick to sign the Indiana Compact, which will be shown to lawmakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Supporters stress the strain illegal immigrants have put on public services such as schools, medical care and social services. Others argue they provide a cheaper labor source that undercuts Hoosier workers at a time of high unemployment.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The bill has already passed the Senate and is awaiting action in the House.</p>
<p>If it does pass, the city&rsquo;s convention association said that it has been told by executives of the Presbyterian Church&rsquo;s Bi-Annual Conference  &mdash;  scheduled to meet in Indianapolis this July  &mdash;  that they would not hold their conference here.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Convention &amp; Visitors Association has &#8220;a growing concern&#8221; that the legislation will damage the local tourism industry, said spokesman Chris Gahl.</p>
<p>Jerry Powell, president of Resource Recycling, based in Portland, Ore., runs multiple conferences a year, including one scheduled in Indianapolis in August.</p>
<p>He said he couldn&rsquo;t pull the conference out of Indianapolis this summer because of legal and financial obligations with the JW Marriott, but he said that he would never hold another conference in Indiana again if the immigration bill passes.</p>

		<p>Mainline Protestant churches have really become far-left on social issues.  The Episcopal Church, to which I still belong on paper, had its General Convention in Denver in 2000.  It was to have been held at an Adams Mark hotel, but the NAACP sued the chain for discriminating against guests attending the Black College Reunion in Daytona; and the Church moved the convention to another hotel because it didn&rsquo;t want to support any business accused of racism.</p>

		<p>For one, Gov. Mitch Daniels is said to be a major Presidential contender next year.  I&rsquo;d love the state legislature to force his hand on such a crucial issue.  I already don&rsquo;t trust him for his outsourcing of the Indiana Toll Road operations to Saudi Arabia.  If he vetoes such a bill, that&rsquo;ll tell me everything I need to know.</p>
<p>Second, as far as religion in Indiana, don&rsquo;t forget that Jim Jones got his start in Indianapolis.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the article AR. Another place I will never visit if the immigration bill does not pass. I have already visited AZ twice and plan a return this year. Indiana needs to heed the will of the people as expressed by the representatives passing the bill. The others can go to Mexico for their conventions and tourist visits.</p>

		<p>So, a State should have its housing, education and welfare services debauched. Have it&rsquo;s wages driven down and it&rsquo;s crime rate driven up.</p>
<p>Because otherwise a convention might not be held there!</p>
<p>People really need to start manning up.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t listen to them! If these sore-losers chose their conference locations on ideology only they&rsquo;d all be meeting in California or Britain. I&rsquo;m sure they, and many others, will be doing business in Indiana when this passes. Regardless, Indiana will benefit from immigration enforcement far more than it would from a few meetings.</p>

<p>Translation: The special interests they represent want to use illegals for cheap labor.</p>
<p>When this bill passes I recommend they make surprise inspections at all the members of that association and fine the bejeezus out of them.</p>

		<p>The &#8220;damage to the tourism industry&#8221; is of course the fleeing of illegal aliens the &#8220;tourism industry&#8221; likes to hire rather than American citizens, college kids, or high school kids who are citizens.  Pass the bill.  Let them flee.  Recorded employment will go up, wages will go up, crime will go down, social services will go down, and there will be a net financial gain all around.  Plus, if anything is going to &#8220;hurt the tourism industry&#8221; this summer, it will be the price for a gallon of gas, thanks in large part to Marxist Obama&rsquo;s moratorium on drilling for oil.  That will be the PRIMARY cause for a collapse in tourism this summer, and it has nothing at all to do with illegal aliens, but rather with a President illegally holding office and ruling by dictate.</p>

		<p>Who cares about a few conventions? For every convention dollar Indiana loses, they&rsquo;ll save a thousand dollars on services that won&rsquo;t have to be provided to illegals.</p>
<p>Additionally, with fewer illegals cluttering the landscape, Indiana will gain desirability as a place to visit. Why do you think Dollywood, here in East Tennessee has gained so much in popularity? Sevier County is 97% white! White people from the heartland come here to be among their own KIND! </p>
<p>The last time I was at Disney World in Orlando in 1991, I noticed most of the people didn&rsquo;t look like me. I swore I would never go back and have not. </p>

<p>Why is the Presbyterian Church opposed to our nation enforcing its laws? What&rsquo;s in it for the Presbyterian Church? What is their history? Have they always been anti-American or is this a recent thing? That&rsquo;s almost as ridiculous as a recycling firm being &#8220;philosophically opposed&#8221; to the enforcement of our laws. And are there no entities that would actually <i>favor</i> Indiana with a convention due to this decision, or is this another case of biased reporting?</p>

<p>Another example is Branson, Missouri.  &#8220;Classic country music&#8221; are pretty much code words for &#8220;no blacks,&#8221; or not even any troublesome white &#8220;wannabes&#8221; (thinking of another word that starts with &#8220;W&#8221;).  Southwest Missouri has a fast growing Hispanic population, but only in the towns with chicken plucking plants, Branson not being one of them.</p>

		<p>An evironmentalist named Jerry Powell from smart growth Portland is boycotting Indianopolis because the people of Indiana oppose importing high fertility post-1965 nonwhites inot the state. In other words, Jerry Powell the &#8220;environmentalist&#8221; wants to continue-full steam ahead-with an immigration policy that will easily triple the size of the US population over time. I don&rsquo;t get it&hellip;or maybe I do. Jerry Powell is a fake environemtalist. He is using enviromentalism-ecology to make the case for the race-replacement of the Native Born White American Majority&hellip;the one group that contributes 0 to US popualation growth. Native Born White Americans should start having large families again. If and when this happens, &#8220;environmentalist&#8221; Jerry Powell will publicly declare his opposition to large Native born White American families.</p>
<p>Native Born White American Patriots are the only serious and credible environmentalists in America&hellip;the rest are all big fakes.</p>
<p>Ask the Jerry Powell&rsquo;s of this world if they would like to see Native Born White Americans having large Native Born White American families again.</p>

Not another red cent will be given to ANY church for ANY purpose, period. Christianity turned its back on me. I reciprocate.</p>

		<p>Thr problem with Christianity is its utter commitment to universalism.  In their minds, there is only one way to live   &mdash;   the way of Christ   &mdash;   and everything else, including race and national identity, is subsumed under that.  </p>
<p>Presbyterian ministers really do believe that it would be better to have 100,000 Nigerian Christians coming to America than 100 Scots freethinkers (Scotland, of course, being the birthplace of Presbyterianism).  To donate money to this church is to donate money to its campaign.    </p>

		<p>Attrition through Enforcement</p>
<p>Nowadays it is bad news for all those illegal nationals who entered this country, without permission. State laws are tightening up, as the feds have refused to tackle this battle ground Issue. A few States are going against the grain of most US citizens and legal residency. Those particular States as Utah and Washington State are soon going to be painfully aware, as the word gets around of poorly enforced laws. Supplementary States that are leaving the illegal alien floodgates open will also be paying dearly, which means fiscal suffering for their legal people. Better be ready for an onslaught of economic thunder as they head your way? It will not be pleasant as Americans will unseat the pro-illegal alien politicians, who crushed any chance of constructive restrictions. California  &mdash;  the well and truly tested Sanctuary state must now pick the pockets of taxpayers again, because illegal workers and families have flooded in and drained part of the 46 billion deficits the state is facing.</p>
<p>If the federal Pres. Obama&rsquo;s government is reluctant to implement the E-Verify program to identify the immigration status of people in the job market, then State politicians should enforce the law as mandatory. With 10% of US Citizens and permanent residents out of a job, it would be in the best interest of every State lawmakers to enact this law. This would be for everybody in the workplace, newly hired and longtime labor. All should be recognized with cross-referenced documentation, identified on the I-9 form submitted to homeland security. New innovation should be added, that including picture ID on nationwide drivers licenses. This would detect many bogus job seekers to their new employers. ATTRITION THROUGH ENFORCEMENT!</p>
<p>This also goes for billions of welfare dollars spent in the illegal alien high population state of Nevada. But now with a few more less restricting States, thousands will constantly leave the original policing State of Arizona and head outwards? As with Governor of New Mexico who has been less happy with the circumstances of handing out drivers licenses under the previous Governors watch of Gov. Bill Richardson and therefore many will also pack up and move on from there. Currently illegal migrants and immigrants have unlimited access to welfare entitlements, schooling and free health care and Include the obvious costs of jail and imprisonment. Birthright citizenship will be having its day in court. Even if it is not amended, the parents  &mdash;  HAVE NO RIGHTS TO STAY  &mdash;  and should be deported. The bill currently has 68 cosponsors and will amend current U.S. code to entail at least one parent to be a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident for a new born to obtain automatic citizenship.</p>
<p>You as a heavily laden taxpayer should incessantly harass your representative and demand their sponsorship for an amendment. Another controversial bill that will also save federal and State taxpayers is ending &#8220;Chain Migration.&#8221; There is a mounting list of 21 co-sponsors for Rep. Phil Gingrey&rsquo;s Nuclear Family Priority Act (H.R.692) that would end chain migration. H.R.692 would purge all family-preference visa classes, except for spouses and minor children, and creating a renewable visa class for parents. Of course the radical Liberal other side under the pretense of polling people by the University of Texas and Texas Tribune has addressed the subject of 14th Amendment. Not only did these two parties misinform the public being asked, but also misrepresented the act of the birthright citizenship law. Anybody can engineer the questions asked to get a favorable answer in any poll.</p>
<p>Something that the Leftists progressives have intentionally forgot in their radical diatribe, that although The Fourteenth Amendment extends citizenship to all persons born in the U.S. and &#8220;subject to the jurisdiction thereof&#8221;; but it also grants Congress the power to enforce and define the necessities of the amendment. The US Constitution also grants us free speech. So if you are against supporting financially anymore the illegal immigration invasion? First you can join NumbersUSA and not only fax for free the Congress, but join millions of Americans who want to halt this continuous travesty by Liberal politicians. You can also become a member of the local TEA Party with a huge influence gaining momentum in Washington, to stop the Tax and Spend Liberal-Democrats.</p>
<p>Add your voice to the uncountable numbers of people who are fed up with illegal&rsquo;s stealing their jobs, lowering wages. Here is also the Washington Switchboard number 202-224-312 to bombard your unconcerned Senate and House. Personally, I&rsquo;m thoroughly frustrated and furious that we must educate the children of illegal immigrant, and pay for their health care; when we cannot even pay for our own families needs?</p>
<p>National News: America has the highest deficit in US history, and the majority of that debt is owned by Communist China.</p>
<p>SAVE OUR JOBS, buy American, if you can find it?</p>

		<p>Let all who wish to continue the disatrous entitlement of illegal immigrants pay!!  Send them the bill for the education, medical, crimes, housing etc, etc.   Ignorance of the costs, kept hidden by MSM/policicans, allows the arguement to continue.  This is eonomic/cultural/political colonization of USA.  Most citizens do not support illegals. Few benefits come from conventions. Compare it to the costs of entitlements for noncitizens.  Send the SPLC &amp; religions the bill for the costs of courts,education,medical,housing,& crimes.  Lets&rsquo; be very democratic and send the bills for illegals to those who vote against enforcement of immigration laws. I have nothing against foreigns &hellip; I just don&rsquo;t want to pay for them. <br>
  Lets&rsquo; get REAL here. </p>
