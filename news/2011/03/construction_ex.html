<h1>Construction Exec Commits Suicide Two Days Before Sentencing for $19M Federal Highway Fraud</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Marzulli and Brian Kates, Daily News (New York), March 14, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A construction executive committed suicide two days after being convicted of steering federal highway contracts to crooked minority contractors in a $19 million fraud scheme, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>Zohrab Marashlian of Perini Corp. faced up to 12 years in prison and $34.5 million in fines and forfeitures after Wednesday&rsquo;s fraud and money laundering conviction in Brooklyn Federal Court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marashlian bribed three no-show minority firms to put Perini workers on their payroll and process bogus invoices on contracts that required a certain amount of work go to minority companies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Marashlian, chief of Perini&rsquo;s civil division, pulled in $14 million in salary and bonuses between 1994 and 2007  &mdash;  the period in which he secured the fraudulent contracts.</p>

		<p>Why did he kill himself? Sounds like he made out great. Surely this immigrant must have squirreled away something beyond the reach of the Obama Justice Dept. which probably isn&rsquo;t all that interested in his conviction, anyway.</p>

		<p>Even when the Teamsters were under the iron glove of Jimmy Hoffa, the stolen pension fund was at least wisely invested in Las Vegas ventures. And in terms of skimming and diversion schemes in construction, $19 million is peanuts, believe it or not.</p>

		<p>This is some of the nonsense that goes on when people and companies are hired based upon who or what color they are as opposed to how well they perform.  I have been involved in planning and zoning for 25+ years - know scores of construction and engineering firms - and am unaware of ANY minority-owned construction firms or engineering firms. Have never even mat a &#8220;minority&#8221; construction manager or lead engineer or architect.  Where are they all? They must all be in the big cities, none in middle-sized cities of the Northeast.  Frankly, would not trust a firm that had to get work based on their ethnicity.</p>

		<p>This is SOP for the constrution industry. This has been going on for years and will never stop. The actual &#8220;fraud&#8221; starts with the government making some contracts only open to minority &#8220;contractors.&#8221; The original fraud of the fedgov gives birth to the fraud perpetrated by the construction firms.</p>

<p>And he wasn&rsquo;t smart enough to salt some away in an overseas haven?</p>
<p>By its very nature, &#8216;affirmative action&rsquo; is corrupting. It automatically takes the reward away from hard work and efficency and gives it to those who are politically favoured. So, why any surprise when a corrupt system ends up with corruption?</p>

		<p>Why would he kill himself?  He steered contracts towards minorities.  It doesn&rsquo;t even matter that it was with dubious honor.  In Detroit he would have gotten the key to the city.  Saddam Hussein did, how hard can it be?</p>

		<p>Armenians are one of the few minority groups which do not yet qualify for aa. Reagan added the Hindus and Hasidic Jews. The Mulisms will probably be included before Obama leaves office. Middle Eastern Christians like the Lebanese and Armenians may never get it.</p>

_____________________________</p>
<p>Sir, you have to understand, these so called minority contractors are just set up to be used by actual construction firms to get the contract. Otherwise, they do no actual work.<br>
Many times, the White owned construction firms just set up their own inhouse dummy &#8220;minority&#8221; firm. Usually, they use a person&rsquo;s wife to head it up. It&rsquo;s all just on paper.</p>
