<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Tony Hill said an unusually disheartening day of substitute teaching Glendale middle-school students spurred him to write a letter to Senate President Russell Pearce.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t intend for that letter to be read on the Senate floor by Sen. Lori Klein, R-Anthem, or for it to become the center of an immigration legislation debate. He didn&rsquo;t intend for it to become the focus of a public-records fight between Pearce and the media, or to find himself the center of media attention.</p>
<p>But it was, and now he is.</p>
<p>Hill said he wrote the letter Klein read last week, and he said every word is true. Klein did not name the author during her speech.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pearce told the media he would not release the author&rsquo;s name because the teacher would &#8220;probably be attacked, probably be fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a few hours later, Senate Republican staff released the original letter.</p>
<p>When contacted by phone, Hill said he didn&rsquo;t write the letter out of malice or hatred.</p>
<p>&#8220;It just upset me that this was what&rsquo;s occurring &hellip; to see this disregard for America and their hatred towards it and their entitlement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hill, who said he has a master&rsquo;s degree in education and is working as a substitute teacher until he can find a teaching position at the community college level, said this was the first letter he&rsquo;s written to a legislator. He said he regrets sending the letter because of the media attention it attracted.</p>

						<p>
							<i>The Arizona Republic, March 21, 2011</i></font>
						</p>
						<p>March 15, 2011</p>
<p>Dear Senator Russell Pearce,</p>
<p>I am compelled to write to you about a recent event that occurred to me. I currently work as a substitute teacher in the west valley areas of Phoenix, Glendale, and Peoria. I was called upon to teach history and language arts for 8th grade at a Glendale public school. The number of students I had in each class ranged from 28 to 38 children, which were almost all Hispanic and a couple of Black children. The day started out as usual turning on the television listening and watching the announcements and saying the Pledge of Allegiance. During the Pledge of Allegiance I notice the vast majority of students refusing to stand and say the pledge. I asked the students why they refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance and they responded by saying, &#8220;we are Mexicans and Americans stole our land.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teacher&rsquo;s instructions were for the students to read a few pages and answer the questions regarding Mark Twain in their history textbook and to finish their final drafts to Senator Steve Gallardo thanking him for his position on Illegal Immigration rights. Their teacher apparently had showed them a video with Senator Steve Gallardo and Lou Dobbs. Most of the students came unprepared for class not possessing paper and pencil. I provided the students with paper and pencils only to have them wade-up the paper and throw it at each other along with their pencils.</p>
<p>The students&rsquo; final drafts that I read were basically the same. Most of them stated they were in the country illegally, White Americans are racist, and that they came here for a better life. I asked the class if America adopted Mexico immigration laws would Americans still be consider racist?</p>
<p>That question they could not answer and called me a racist for asking it. I mentioned that my wife and children are Hispanic so how could I be racist? I asked the students to stop speaking Spanish in class because it was impolite to speak a language in front of people who may not speak that language. Their response was that Americans better learn Spanish and their customs because they are taking their land back from us.</p>
<p>When it came to completing the Mark Twain assignment only 10 students completed it out of all my classes. Most of the students refused to open the book, tore the pages out of the book, or threw the textbooks at each other. I thought are these the students we are trying to educate with taxpayers money. I have found that substitute teaching in these areas most of the Hispanic students do not want to be educated but rather be gang members and gangsters. They hate America and are determined to reclaim this area for Mexico. If we are able to remove the illegals out of our schools, the class sizes would be reduced and the students who wanted to learn would have a better chance to do so and become productive citizens.</p>
<p>I applaud and support your efforts to stop this invasion into our state and country. When the citizens of a country are forced to speak the invaders language, adopt their customs, and forced to support them, are we not a conquer nation? I do not want to see our state and nation turned into a third world country. Thank you for standing up to this invasion. You may contact me by phone, e-mail, or mail. Thank you, again.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Tony Hill</p>

		<p>America paid for our lands with money and blood!</p>
<p>The Mexican commissioners were disposed to agree to all the major American demands, save one: The cession of Lower, or Baja, California. This, for whatever reason (and several have been suggested by various historians) they adamantly refused to give up, also demanding that a strip of land, permitting unrestricted passage from Sonora to Baja California, also be included in the treaty. When Trist finally agreed to this concession, after an initial refusal to consider it, the remainder of the negotiations went more quickly. After that, the only other disagreement of any consequence which arose was over whether or not San Diego was located in Upper or Lower California. After much consulting of maps, it was finally agreed to include it in the territory ceded to the United States.</p>
<p>By the end of January 1848, it was apparent to Trist that he had obtained everything Polk wanted, with the exception of Lower California, the cession of which, according to his original instructions, was not as vital to the administration as that of New Mexico and Upper California (for which the U.S. paid $15 million). Taking a firm stance, he pressured the Mexicans to finish up the work they&rsquo;d begun two months earlier. On February 2, 1848, Trist, along with Couto, Atristan, and Cuevas put his signature on the treaty, which included an additional &#8220;secret&#8221; article allowing for up to eight months to pass between the time the treaty was signed and the exchange of ratifications by both governments.</p>

		<p>Whenever I hear that *&^%# about how my state, California belongs to Mexico I simply ask them &#8220;how long did Mexico own California?&#8221;  None of them know.  I reply &#8221; Mexico owned California for exactly 14 years, 1822 to 1836.  Before that Spain owned it for about 50 years, from 1775 to 1822.  Before that, the Indians owned it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I ask them if they know how many Mexicans lived in California before the Americans took it by force, violence and war.  They never know.  </p>
<p>I reply &#8221; the last Mexican census, 1830 had just 2 catagories, Mexican and Indian.  There were only 6 thousand Mexicans living in California recorded in  that 1830 census.  But the &#8220;Mexicans&#8221; were not all Mexicans.  Ethnically, there were many Americans, both black and White, Europeans, Pacific Islanders, Filipinos and lots of Chinese, mostly from southern China, refugees from the  horrible Taiping civil war.&rsquo; </p>
<p>Then I recap, Indians for thousands of years, Spain for 50 years, Mexico for 14 years and the United States for 175 years.</p>
<p>The only races who have any standing in the &#8220;who owns California debate are the Indians and the Americans.</p>

		<p> Despite suggestions by the reporter that Mr. Hill might be misrepresenting himself, what he recounts sounds highly likely to have happened just the way he said it did, in view of what we have heard and seen of so many Hispanic activists and their effect on the young people in their ethnic group in the U.S.</p>
<p> Every time I hear one ethnic group saying of another, &#8220;You stole our land!&#8221; I have to laugh. Folks, your people didn&rsquo;t have any warranty deed to this land, signed and registered at the courthouse. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way when it comes to the sections of this earth occupied by various ethnic groups and races. Land belongs to him who is strong enough to take it and hold it. Your ancestors   &mdash;   the portion of them who were Spanish   &mdash;   took it from the Indians, who had taken it from someone else a number of centuries before.</p>
<p> The area of Europe that was Yugoslavia has been carved up, and people shifted from one part to another, innumerable times in just the last 100 years. Alsace-Lorraine passed back and forth from Germany to France several times. A huge swath of eastern Germany was simply carved off and given to Poland, and two million Germans driven out of it, after World War II.</p>
<p> The Arabs have been hyper-ventilating for 63 years that the Israelis &#8220;stole our land.&#8221; That&rsquo;s nonsense. The group itself is what counts. The Jews continued to exist as a people although driven out of many nations for 2,000 years, because they refused to intermarry, or give up their religion. Their toast was always, &#8220;Next year in Jerusalem!&#8221; but they always remained practical. Their occupation and re-making of Palestine into the State of Israel is one of the very few instances in history where a group really did &#8220;regain its land.&#8221; </p>

		<p>With a horde of invaders like this, I give it twenty years tops before a civil war becomes an absolute necessity in order to hold the country together. When the Southwest becomes almost entirely Mexican and the ethnic cleansing reaches a fever pitch, even a liberal president will be compelled to call out troops to retain the integrity of the United States. The kids mentioned in this letter are entirely alien and do not belong here. They will either get their fondest wish to annex large parts of the US to Mexico, or they will be defeated. I grow more and more pessimistic everyday. On a positive note, as these revanchist desires become more and more open, it will compel more and more Whites to take pro-White positions as a matter of survival.</p>

		<p>Thanks goes to the Supreme Court for its 5-4 decison in Plyer v. Doe for forcing tax-payer funded schools to admit these America-hating mestizos. Also, the US congress&rsquo; refusal to clearly define in legislation the original intent of the 14th amendment no doubt had resulted in many of these anti-American mestizos being granted citizenship and settling in Arizona. Oh, and the greedy business wing of the AZ Republican Party just got the state to defeat several pieces of legislation aimed at stopping and reversing the invasion, including a bill which would keep these vile brats out of tax payer substitdized public schools .  </p>

		<p>Mexicans apparently know almost as much about history as they do about rocket science.</p>
<p>To them, anything they desire is automatically theirs, which they can justify with the pretext that it was stolen. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s pure fiction.</p>
<p>Just listen to their pre-programmed, Democrat-approved responses. &#8220;You&rsquo;re a racist for asking that.&#8221; No, you&rsquo;re a coward running from reality because inside you know you are wrong and you won&rsquo;t face up to it.</p>

		<p>Our town has a recently arrived population of these &lsquo;youth&rsquo;. And, by some coincidence, a new problem with graffiti. One newcomer took down an American flag from a local business and ran through the street, dragging it along.</p>
<p>The presence of low-IQ minorities has made life more expensive, more dangerous, and less fun for native born Americans. Nobody voted for this.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve read some of the comments below the article. What&rsquo;s funny is the repeated remarks of racist that go round if the comment is against illegals. They also trashed Mr. Hill yet I doubt very much they know him. My question is then, how do they know what exactly Mr. Hill is? They&rsquo;ve assumed&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; he&rsquo;s white. Now who is the racist? What a damn shame we&rsquo;ve come to this.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to speak English.<br>

You don&rsquo;t have to be Christian.  <br>

<p>I have the voice of a woman in my head who appeared on c-span discussing her experience with minority students. She claimed we weren&rsquo;t doing enough to help blacks and Hispanics in school. </p>
<p>The phrase that is stuck in my head is her high-pitched, whining assertion that &#8220;these kids WANT to learn!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Somebody needs to tell these Mexicans outright in no uncertain terms that they have more land than they can ever use in Mexico. What land they have developed down there is no more than a conglomeration of tar paper shacks, raw sewage in the streets, in an environment of abysmal corruption, which is EXACTLY what any land in the US they now claim is theirs would look like as well if they had retained it.  If the Gringo had not won the land via war, monetary payment, with a signed treaty, it would be just an extension of Mexico.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re too dimwitted to understand that anybody knows full well that it is not land they want but the development the Gringo has constructed on it, something they could not create themselves, so they continue their idiotic mantra about being the legitimate owners of our land. </p>
<p>Like every non-white in the US right now, as a group, they could not build a prosperous country.  It is beyond their abilities. Their presence here is unequivocal proof of their failure and inabilities. So, what they intend now is to steal our country.  </p>
<p>They would not be able do that, however, were it not for the gutless, naive white fools who are in positions of power, the same types who allow the kind of attitudes and conducts flourish as this article describes.</p>
<p>Our real enemies are these same whites who cater to these dark-skinned miscreants, because they haven&rsquo;t the courage to stand up and fight for fear they&rsquo;ll lose their financial status and their power.</p>
<p>I just read where many states have spent all the stimulus money allotted them by the messiah and are now frantically trying to make budget cuts and enact austerity measures in order to prevent mass layoffs.  Wisconsin is only one of many who are cutting back vigorously.  2012 will be more of the same, with a possible depression likely then, if it does not come sooner.  </p>
<p>We will go through a period where our property taxes will be raised far in excess of legitimate property values, as the governments try to keep from collapsing totally, even going so far as to renege on pension obligations to public employees.  Sales and income taxes will be increased, and those states who had no income and or sales tax, will enact both by legislative decree, in a last ditch attempt to keep from going under to levels where their public departments will resemble skeleton crews.  Social freebies that drew these Mexicans to this country will dry up entirely.</p>
<p>The elites might even be forced to legalize drugs in order to benefit from the taxes derived from their sale and the benefits of cost reduction by incarcerating millions fewer drug users and dealers, thereby reducing court costs, incarceration costs, with savings from fewer salaries paid to people who are employed in the fields related to them, all to keep from going under.</p>
<p>In short, these Mexes are going to find out that the land they want to steal will no longer offer freebies they sneaked into the country to receive, right along with almost zero job availability for unskilled labor, plus very likely their low intensity conflict with blacks over the now decreasing numbers of low level jobs will accelerate their feelings of hatred towards each other, resulting in more fighting a killing than what has been exhibited so far.</p>
<p>So, if I were these Mex types who sneer at our traditions, culture and values and who delight in spitting on the graves of our ancestors, I wouldn&rsquo;t feel too cocky about getting their way right now, because it&rsquo;s ALL in the process of change, and their miserable lives and futures are ALL in doubt.  </p>

		<p>Paraphrasing from my comment on yesterday&rsquo;s article:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latinos�? are a diverse people who share one great salient characteristic: Complete inability to be rational, especially with anyone outside their in-group. To understand them, you have to understand the thought processes of a small child.</p>
<p>Whoever opposes them in their quest to get whatever they want whenever they want it, whether they deserve it or not, is &#8220;unfair.&#8221; If the opponent is the superior Anglo/White establishment, it becomes racist as well as unfair. No other people on this planet are so mentally limited by their own mass persecution complex, and so impermeable to logic or reason. This has been going on since the Spanish conquest and before, when the various indigenous tribes were treating each other with no more consideration than the Spanish did.</p>
<p>The author knows as well or better than I that there are very few questions these &#8220;students&#8221; can answer in ANY field. As far as they&rsquo;re concerned, intelligence is &#8220;racist&#8221; as well, because so pitifully few of them possess much of it.</p>
<p>The ignorance is boundless, the political views memorized slogans, the ability to manage the kind of society that provides &#8220;a better life&#8221; extremely limited, and the capacity to comprehend that this won&rsquo;t be a good place to live anymore if they are in charge of things non-existent.</p>
<p>The author, like myself, is apparently one us who knows these people&rsquo;s weaknesses while finding it hard to genuinely dislike them.

<p>And their intention is for revenge. That is what is on their minds. One way or another, decades from now but it will happen. And it will not be pretty when it happens.</p>
<p>Such hate, such venom, such disrespect and lack of civility. And purposeful too, without any amelioration. Baseless hate directed against those that could do them so good. And this from what are basically KIDS! And now not only concentrated only in the American southwest, but ALL OVER the nation as well. Beware!<br>
And worse, they have the nerve to call whitey a hater and racist.</p>

		<p>There is a specific date by which we can say the Mexican secessionist movement began, and that was May Day 2006.  We shouldn&rsquo;t forget the vastly heightened demands for separation and independence by the Mexican marchers, placard wavers, and speakers all over California on that day putting a large number of their peoples&rsquo; stamp of approval on their leaders&rsquo; demands for secession, independence, and separatism.</p>
<p>They made it very clear that they don&rsquo;t want American citizenship, that they want to secede from our Union.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s mildly ironic that all we hear about is &#8220;white separatism&#8221; or &#8220;white secession,&#8221; when an actual five year old movement by Mexicans is going on right now.</p>

		<p>I agree with Mr. Hill&rsquo;s observations, but I wonder how he ever graduated from college with such a weak grasp of written English.  The content is excellent; the execution terrible.<br>
This letter is a proofreader&rsquo;s nightmare, but serves as a very good format for a high-school English lesson.  My impression is that this man writes at about a 7th grade level.</p>
<p>Let us begin with the first sentence:  An event does not occur to you.  An event takes place.  But even that construction is awkward.  Why use the word event at all?  This is not the writing of a native speaker of English.<br>
I suppose in today&rsquo;s world black is capitalized when describing a group, out of an overly sensitive effort not to offend; but when I was in school black and white when describing skin color were not capitalized.<br>
The day did not turn on the television; a with before television would help.  <br>
He incorrectly says notice instead of noticed. In what grade do we learn to us tenses properly?<br>
Had showed?  What happened to had shown?  Had showed is ignorant.<br>
Next, he needs a comma before not possessing.<br>
Wade-up the paper?  Does he not know the word wad?<br>
Mexico immigration laws should be Mexican immigration laws.<br>
Considered instead of consider.<br>
Americans had better, not better.<br>
&#8220;I thought are these the students we are trying to educate with taxpayers money.&#8221; should be: I thought, &#8220;Are these the students that we are trying to educate with taxpayers&rsquo; money?&#8221;<br>
The next sentence is disjointed and incorrect.  Are the Hispanic students substitute teaching?<br>
Remove out of is redundant and ignorant, as is invasion into.<br>
Where is the apostrophe in &#8220;invaders language.&#8221;?<br>
A conquered nation, not a conquer nation.</p>
<p>What a mess this is, and a terrible reflection on the educational system that produced this so-called teacher.<br>
How can he teach anyone English if he cannot even write it himself?</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m afraid jack from OKC and GWS are correct, this will end in blood because these invaders want to kill us, then take our land from us. Whites are going to have to learn from my Russian ancestors the lesson they learned, namely anyone darker than you is there to kill your people and take your land, therefore kill them, all of them where ever they are in your lands. Otherwise they will do the same to you. This is going to lead to bloodshed, and American soil will run red with the blood of white Americans and enemy aliens alike. I&rsquo;m afraid whites are only now waking up to the fact the ruling elite, the rich and the military are going to side with these brown invaders who in my view are insurrectionists who deserve meeting their deaths in hails of American bullets.</p>

		<p>Here is what that teacher should have told the students:</p>
<p>1.  The southwest of what is now the United States was ceded to the United States by Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.  That treaty is what ended the Mexican-American war.</p>
<p>2.  One condition of the treaty was that Mexicans living in what is now the United States could stay where they were, keeping ownership of their property.  They could decide to be American or Mexican citizens, and if they didn&rsquo;t make a choice they automatically became American citizens.  The vast majority of those Mexicans stayed and became American citizens.  Thus no Mexican living in Mexico can claim that they are coming back to some ancestral land that was &#8220;stolen&#8221; from them.</p>
<p>3.  If the landed ceded by Mexico is now regarded as &#8220;stolen&#8221;, that means that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is no longer in force, and thus that Mexico and the United States are still in a state of war.  Thus all Mexicans living in the United States are enemy aliens and should be deported or kept in internment camps.</p>
<p>4.  American politicians are stupid, craven traitors for allowing the only nation on Earth that still makes territorial claims against the U.S.A. to send us millions of its own citizens as occupiers.<br>

		<p>What do people with no interest in schooling think they&rsquo;re going to &#8220;take over&#8221;?  Do they think they will take over Silicon Valley and Wall Street just by being the majority?  Do they think they will keep the US infrastructure and energy grid going with no education beyond Latino/a Studies?</p>
<p>If they are capable of learning to work in the Valley, on the Street, and at the energy plants, who is capable of teaching them?  Who pays the taxes that fund that teaching?  Do the angry Hispanics expect those teachers and taxpayers to happily enable their own destruction, and to feel unending white guilt while doing so?</p>
<p>These are moot points anyway.  If they can&rsquo;t handle an essay on Mark Twain, these kids are not going to suddenly smarten up enough to fill Harvard and MIT.  If there were no white people, the tech work would be done by Indians and NE Asians, not low IQ Mestizos.  I assume most &#8220;Hispanics&#8221; (thank you Nixon for that meaningless category) who make it into positions of power will be white Hispanics.  The same white Hispanics who abuse Mestizos in Central America, but who suddenly transform into oppressed colored folks the second they cross the border.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s one thing I want to know.  It appears that Mexico was doing a lousy job of educating their underclass long before NAFTA came along.  So they send their underclass up here with zero education, zero ability to speak English, and we&rsquo;re supposed to be turning them into Rhodes scholars?  How?  Do they think white Americans are magicians or something?</p>
<p>So they want a better life up here.  What or who made life better up here?  I don&rsquo;t suppose the angry Hispanics will ask themselves that, or feel grateful for being allowed to benefit from the intelligence and smarts of the people who made the society they want a better life from.  They don&rsquo;t seem to have the ability to ponder such things.</p>

		<p>As a former public schoolteacher, I know exactly what this brave young man is talking about.  That IS the attitude of these ill-advised young people.  Fortunately for us, they are lazy, many are on drugs and alcohol, and since many were not nourished properly in childhood, their brains are not as well-developed as they should be, and so they are relatively stupid.  This is NOT an accusation; it is a fact, particularly with first-generation Hispanic kids in America.  What it will take to defeat them is brains, which WE have - and not brawn, which THEY have and admire (just check the stats to see who watches the PPV cage fighting human animals on the weekends).  They are simply not smart enough to take back much of anything except maybe the Mojave desert, and most people would let them have it for free, if they stayed out of everywhere else in this country.  Seriously, they can&rsquo;t reproduce fast enough or raise their IQ&rsquo;s fast enough to take any part of America away from us - unless we&rsquo;re dumb enough to give it to them.</p>

<p>Just one observation on your last sentence here.  I don&rsquo;t think the Indians owned it ever.  That is because they didn&rsquo;t know where they were.  They lived on the land like any animal, unaware and uninterested in any outside world, and introverted beyond their basic instincts.  They used to be famous for having no concept of land ownership.  That fact has been worked on politically because it no longer serves politically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reply �? the last Mexican census, 1830 had just 2 catagories, Mexican and Indian. There were only 6 thousand Mexicans living in California recorded in that 1830 census. But the &ldquo;Mexicans�? were not all Mexicans. Ethnically, there were many Americans, both black and White, Europeans, Pacific Islanders, Filipinos and lots of Chinese, mostly from southern China, refugees from the horrible Taiping civil war.&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt; You&rsquo;re more than a few years off regarding the Chinese in California, old boy.  Here is a copy and paste from an online history of the Chinese in California; </p>
<p>Few if any Chinese appear to have traveled to California in the pursuit of this (fur)trade and no Chinese merchants established themselves in California. The Ching Dynasty had severely restricted all contact with the outside world. After 1760 the only ports open to foreign trade were located in Kwangtung Province in the south of China. It was against the law for Chinese to travel outside of China except with the specific permission of the Emperor. The Opium War of 1839-1842 resulted in the Treaty of Nanking which opened five additional ports and ceded Hong Kong to Britain, but contact between Westerners and Chinese was still severely limited.</p>
<p>The earliest documented arrival of significant numbers of Chinese people in California dates from the middle of the nineteenth century. Gold was found on the American River in California early in 1848 and word of the discovery was first disseminated by ships engaged in trade throughout the world. Among the first to learn of the new El Dorado were the people of Kwangtung Province. The Ching Dynasty was in decline, flood and famine had racked the country in 1846 and 1848, and the Tai Ping Rebellion was about to break out. Law and tradition argued against travel to California, but poverty and a desire for quick riches were powerful motivations for a few hardy souls. These few soon sent back word of Gum Shan (Gold Mountain) and triggered a wave of Chinese Argonauts. The first rough census of Chinese in California was initiated in 1852 when 25,000 were counted. The vast majority of them were from Kwangtung.</p>

If Americans are so racist, why is it that so many Mexicans immigrate to the United States? They do so because Anglos can run a better country, and a better economy than they can. <br>
 <br>
If Mexico had won the Mexican War, as many military analysts in Europe expected it to, Mexico would be at least twice as large as it is. It would be just as badly run. Mexicans would still be immigrating to the United States. <br>

<p>Are you starting to grasp the kinds of things that are being openly taught to ALL American children in American classrooms?</p>
<p><i>Whenever I hear that *&^%# about how my state, California belongs to Mexico I simply ask them &ldquo;how long did Mexico own California?</i></p>
<p>Anon #2:</p>
<p>Mexicans and central Americans (who also lay claim to this land, believe me I hear it) with below room temperature IQs cannot follow such a complex argument.</p>
<p>Simply say this:  Mexico fought and lost a war; it signed a treaty and accepted $15 million from the U.S.   This is American land; no Mexican has a right to it.</p>
<p>Repeat ad infinitum.</p>
<p><i>So, if I were these Mex types who sneer at our traditions, culture and values&hellip;I wouldn&rsquo;t feel too cocky about getting their way right now, because it&rsquo;s ALL in the process of change, and their miserable lives and futures are ALL in doubt.</i></p>
<p>They sneer at our traditions, culture and values because our government allows them to freely do so in public and in the media, and, in fact teaches them such in the schools while stomping down any White who deigns to complain about being race-replaced, forced to pay confiscatory taxes to support these people and resists being usurped from his homeland.</p>
<p>The government, with its mighty force and power, will back THE INVADERS not US and until and unless this changes and WE are allowed to organize in our own best interests WE are the ones whose future is in doubt.</p>

<p>Tim Pawlenty:  C+</p>
<p>Michelle Bachmann: B-</p>
<p>Lowest possible score: 0bama:  F-</p>
<p>And, as Anon #5 informs us:  <i>The AZ Republican Party just got the state to defeat several pieces of legislation aimed at stopping and reversing the invasion, including a bill which would keep these vile brats out of tax payer substitdized public schools.</i></p>
<p>George Wallace was not wrong when he stated there isn&rsquo;t a dime&rsquo;s worth of difference between the two parties.</p>
<p>We Native Born White Americans have no friends in the government.  We are on our own, just as  planned, kept atomized and separated, our rights dwindling away:</p>
<p><i>Judge orders use of Islamic law in Tampa lawsuit&hellip;&rsquo;This case,&rsquo; the judge wrote, &#8216;will proceed under Ecclesiastical Islamic Law.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>As our Constitution is torn asunder.</p>
<p><i>How bad does it have to get before we fight back?</i></p>
<p>Very bad, as in land clearances of Whites with possible on-site executions, starting in California.  Will it come to this? At this moment, from my vantage point in California, and from how I see Whites being dehumanized everywhere,  I don&rsquo;t see any signs that this won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>If you believe I&rsquo;m wrong, instead of calling me a defeatist and telling me &#8220;we don&rsquo;t need people like you in our movement!&#8221; explain yourself.  Outline what YOU see as a positive future for Whites because I don&rsquo;t see it.  I believe our fate is the same as Whites in SA:  that of genocide</p>
<p>But, even a rabbit will fight back if cornered.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t think our enemies don&rsquo;t know this:</p>
<p><i>Obama is holding meetings that could determine if you can even own a gun in the future&hellip;the White House staff, along with radical gun ban groups, are working overtime on scores of anti-gun rights proposals that Obama could enact by Executive Order.</i></p>
<p><i>No President has ever been as anti-gun and vindictive to gun owners as Barack Obama.</i></p>
<p>Please keep this in mind.</p>
<p>And to Mr. Hill:  You are very brave to have done what you did, may all kudos, praise and honor be bestowed upon you.  You have eloquently stated truths which will most likely cost you your job, reputation and pension.  And, for going up against and questioning the PC Reign or Terror, you are sure to receive Death Threats as well.  </p>
<p>And even though Death Threats are a Felony, YOU will be the one charged with a Felony because you deigned to challenge set-in-stone educational Dogma: Those  PC and multi-cultural lies which must NEVER be questioned.</p>
<p>I highly doubt Ms. Klein will come to your defense.</p>
<p>Good luck to you, you will need it.</p>

I taught in a school that had the first illegal alien 6 man football player of the year. He could neither read, write, or do simple arithmetic; but, he could run very fast. He graduated, but on drugs and was eventually sent back to Mexico 2 or 3 times. Never took, though, because how hard was it to get back in? </p>

		<p>&#8220;My fear is that this will end in blood. Unfortunately, the federal and many, if not most, state governments side with the invaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UN will also side with the invaders. Whites will be demonized. All the military might of the world will be used on us.  People have told us this was coming for decades. What they&rsquo;re doing in Libya, intervening in a civil war, is setting the precedent. Then world communism will be in place even though it disappeared.</p>

<p>I agree with you, Roger. Mr. Hill&rsquo;s letter is so fraught with errors I was surprised to read he has a degree in education. </p>
<p>However, many of the errors are in spelling, perhaps typographical, not structural. At some time or other we all make typos, especially me. And you, too: &#8220;He incorrectly says notice instead of noticed. In what grade do we learn to us tenses properly?&#8221; But, for an educated man, Mr. Hill made way too many careless mistakes, as you point out. </p>

<p>&#8220;When will there ever be enough citizens of this country&hellip;&#8221;?</p>
<p>This is exactly the question we should ask first when it comes to immigration, legal or otherwise. I do not believe anybody truly knows how many people are living in our country today. The Census is a joke. My guess: There&rsquo;s 50 million to 75 million people here illegally and approximately 320 million citizens. In other words, I believe our current total population is nearer 400 million than the 300 million usually stated. Compare that to the 160 million in population just sixty years ago and you can understand why I say we are already way past the &#8220;over-population&#8221; point. </p>
<p>If we had a sane government in Washington, a &#8220;maximum allowed&#8221; number would be set before there was any debate over immigration reform.  </p>
<p>Anyone care to guess the second question that should be asked concerning immigration?<br>

		<p><i>What do people with no interest in schooling think they&rsquo;re going to &ldquo;take over�?? Do they think they will take over Silicon Valley and Wall Street just by being the majority?</i></p>
<p>Alas, yes. Their leaders as well as white liberals will push through affirmative action, requiring their &#8220;representation&#8221; in industry and finance. Of course, if they lack the smarts to run these things, we will see further economic decline and more financial debacles. The downward slide will continue, but that is a small price to pay for &#8220;equality.&#8221; </p>
<p><br>
<i>Do they think they will keep the US infrastructure and energy grid going with no education beyond Latino/a Studies?</i></p>
<p>You wonder how much of American infrastructure decline is owing to the universities wasting several decades on ethnic and women&rsquo;s studies? And to affirmative action pushing unqualified students into the universities and civil services? We are not training the engineers and scientists we need. The fact that America is importing more IT people, as well as IT technologies, ought to give the citizenry cause for concern. But as the citizenry is being dumbed down and/or replaced with illegal immigrants, concern for such things seems to be on the downturn.</p>
<p>The strength of a people ought to be in its citizenry, but the elites are in a race to see who can elect a new people.  </p>

There is a specific date by which we can say the Mexican secessionist movement began, and that was May Day 2006. We shouldn&rsquo;t forget the vastly heightened demands for separation and independence by the Mexican marchers, placard wavers, and speakers all over California on that day putting a large number of their peoples&rsquo; stamp of approval on their leaders&rsquo; demands for secession, independence, and separatism.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one thing I want to know. It appears that Mexico was doing a lousy job of educating their underclass long before NAFTA came along.</p>
<p>The Mexicans don&rsquo;t educate the underclass at all.  I know a woman who is a teacher&rsquo;s aide and translator in one of those hispanic schools.  She told me all about the Mexican elementary education system.  </p>
<p>School is free to 6th grade.  Jr high costs tuition and fees that are moderate for the middle class but totally unaffordable for the huge underclass.  High school is even more expensive.</p>
<p>In the rural areas there are no school buses.  The parents don&rsquo;t have cars.  So how are the kids to get 5 or 10 miles to town for schooling?  There is no effort to do do what was done in rural America in the 19th century, tiny one teacher schoolhouses  accessible to kids living in rural areas.</p>
<p>The kids are put to work at 6 or 7 watching the babies or peddling or chasing birds away from the crop.  City kids have plenty of accessible elementary schools but are often sent out to peddle and or beg.  The girls are indentured as maids to middle class people at age 10 or so.  Of course part of the work of the maid in latin america is to be sexually available to any male member of the family or visitor who wants them no matter what her age. Probably why the statuory rape law stops on girl&rsquo;s 12th birthday.</p>
<p>That is the Mexican education system in one of the richest countries of the world.  Basically worse than Africa.<br>

<p>&gt; You&rsquo;re more than a few years off regarding the Chinese in California, old boy. Here is a copy and paste from an online history of the Chinese in California; </p>
<p>Anonymous replies:</p>
<p>I happen to be a direct descendant of a Chinese woman who arrived in california with an entire shipload of Chinese from Canton, the Province that suffered the most from the civil war.<br>
Canton was a rebel province.  Every time the imperial troops invaded Canton the Cantonese fled to the ships and went wherever they could.  Many went to the Fillipines.  Others to Vietnam and other Asian countries.</p>
<p>I once worked with a Chinese immigrant who knew a lot about Chinese history.  He was a direct descendant of one of the Imperial generals who suppressed the rebellion.  His ancestor became a provincial governor and nobleman as a reward for his service.  Read early California history (not from the internet) and you will learn that Chinese, mostly southerners arrived in California as early as 1820.  Because of the civil war between the north and south many southerners arrived from 1830 on.</p>
<p>The native daughters and sons of the golden west is an association of Californians whose ancestors arrived before 1851.  They have a lot of information.  There are many small historical societies and museums in California.  They have a lot of information that is not on the internet.  Since that information comes from for example, newspaper articles dated 1870 it is more reliable than something on the internet.</p>
<p>One last thought; what makes you think that the Chinese ever in 5000 years ever obeyed any government edict or law that was contrary to their interests?  </p>
<p>Most of the Cantonese peasants who fled china between 1820 and 1860 because of the civil war were probably totally unaware of the anti immigration law because Canton and other southern provinces were governed by the rebel forces. Did the Confederate states obey Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s laws passed during our civil war?</p>
<p>The revisionist racist White hating historians that infest our academic world now claim that the Chinese were brought over as opressed slave laborers to build the trans continental railroad<br>
in the early 1860&rsquo;s.  Those historians never mention the eastern part of that railway that was built by Irish immigrants.  They want people to think the entire railroad all the way east to Chicago was built by Chinese.</p>
<p>Most of my White ancestors arrived for the gold Rush and stayed.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;we are Mexicans and Americans stole our land.�?</p>
<p>I have been hearing this since the early 1970s from Mexicans in Northern California.  In the late 1970s, I saw a news report that featured La Raza frankly and in public proclaiming their intention to initiate a &#8220;Reconquesta&#8221; of the Southwest, stealing a term from Spanish history where the real reconquest of Spain from Muslims was completed in 1492.  Ironically, that event was with whites retaking their indigenous land from non-whites.  It is the habit of Hispanics AND Amerinds to make huge leaps in both historic associations and logic in parlaying any political or social point where a lie is required to gain points with their own and other ignorant parties.</p>

		<p>Some of the commenters here make the excellent point that Spanish is a European or &#8220;White People&rsquo;s&#8221; language. Don&rsquo;t expect the logic to have any effect on the folks we&rsquo;re dealing with, though.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more shakey intellectual ground to argue that Indians might make the &#8220;you stole our land&#8221; claim while Mexicans cannot. Mexicans are indoctrinated with the concept that they are of two peoples, Spanish and Indian (= Mestizo), and so can claim that at least half of their ancestry has roots in the &#8220;stolen land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Logical discussion just goes in one ear and out the other with this demographic anyway. All the same, that&rsquo;s how they see it, to the extent that they ever reflect on the sloganeering they&rsquo;ve been indoctrinated with.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time there, and appreciate the fact that  &mdash;  in rural areas anyway  &mdash;  life would go on much as before if ever the industrialized world managed to destory itself. Choose your poison: Nuclear reactor meltdown, military showdown over scarce resources, an essential widget becoming unavailable due to a natural disaster in Lower Slobbovia&hellip; It has little effect on the campesino who goes to town once a week to trade in the open market.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an idealized fantasy of that kind of world in some of the sloganeering. The fact of the matter, though, is that these people don&rsquo;t want to live that kind of life. They want to live OUR kind of life. They want indoor plumbing and loud stereo systems and modern medicine without having to put up with the tiresome white man, his wimpy rule of law, and his boring education system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice for us to know these things, but don&rsquo;t waste your breath pointing out the fallacies and inconsistencies in their &#8220;logic&#8221; to them. It just makes them angrier. <br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s not our land they want, it&rsquo;s our labor.</p>
<p>The overwhelming dominant pattern of behavior of non-whites towards whites is one where they contribute nothing to a productive life while reaping all the benefits of a mechanized, wealthy, high technology civilization that whites and whites ONLY maintain.  Even that would not be so bad except for what they want to do with the free time that results&hellip;..rape, rob, murder and brutalize whites.</p>
<p>There is a name for this.  And it&rsquo;s not crime.  It&rsquo;s slavery.  Whites are de facto slaves to non-whites to varying degrees.  In a situation very similar to apartheid, the vast majority of whites are kept in line by the behaviors of other whites.  Because this includes violence, arrest, economic dispossession and threats of worse down the road, there has not yet risen a counter to this problem among whites.</p>
<p>Non-whites, being non-productive and unable to care for themselves, makes their being the masters, a sick joke.  All it would take to adequately punish them for their audacity would be to stop feeding them&hellip;..literally, stop GIVING them the food they put in thier mouths every day.  No matter how they responded, in short order, it would cull their population by an extremely large amount.  They cannot win a true conflict with us because they are completely dependent on us, is the bottom line.</p>
<p>The issue with other whites is much more problematical&hellip;.and has existed for hundreds of years, resulted in the bloodiest civil war in history, and two world wars where mechanized extermination of people was invented.  To be blunt, various factions of whites have always felt quite comfortable using other races as a type of biological warfare weapon against those who have a conflict with them&hellip;&hellip;to disastrous outcome.</p>
<p>In the racial consciousness war going on, the only real enemy of any importance is other whites.  But, how can you fight them if any effective method involves a third world war?</p>

1. All whites are driven out of the entire southwest regions.<br>
2. Fifty years later, the region is in total ruin and simply looks like Mexico does today.<br>

		<p>I teach latinos in NYC.  Their handlers and &#8216;social justice&rsquo; organizations tell them they are destined to take control of America.  I hear it all the time.  The &#8216;have-as-many-babies-as-you-can&rsquo; attitude is a reflection of this mindset.  </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, a white teacher asked a student to speak english to him because he didn&rsquo;t know spanish.  She told him that he needed to learn spanish, and that she didn&rsquo;t need to learn english.</p>
<p>When the incident made the rounds at school, the all-latino office staff and admins tried to smooth the feathers of the affronted teacher, but he&rsquo;s become very jaded and often speaks of moving to another country when things really get tough.  </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say anything about it, but rather reflected on the fact that outside the school it was 100% latino as far as the eye can see.  Almost half the radio stations are now spanish - and that&rsquo;s on FM.</p>
<p>I see now that where I&rsquo;m at, it is a liability NOT to know spanish, and only optional if you know english.  (All government docs are now in spanish also, and the number of support services for latino families is astronomical.)</p>
<p>Some days I see nothing but latinos from morning to night, save for asians here and there, and a few coworkers at my job who are white or black.  I don&rsquo;t even remember what it&rsquo;s like to live around white people anymore, and I grew up in a 100% white small town.  When I see more than three white people standing next to each other, it is an unfamiliar, almost jarring image.</p>
<p>I do believe that the nation will separate as states abandon the federal government and its mismanaging of everything.  I just feel bad that I&rsquo;m going to be old when the time for survival is upon us.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to be hateful to any of my fellow Amren brothers and sisters because I admire all of you here for being racially awake and it makes my day to read your comments - BUT - I think we&rsquo;ve got MUCH bigger problems facing us as a race than how somebody misspelled a word or missconstucted a sentence. It&rsquo;s like worrying about how the deck chairs are arranged on the Titanic. We as a race have stuck an iceberg, and are sinking fast. If I were being attacked by some ghetto &#8220;yufs&#8221; I personally wouldn&rsquo;t care if the Whites that came to help me could even spell their own name, and I&rsquo;m sure if the gun was against your head, you wouldn&rsquo;t either.<br>
Look, I&rsquo;m no scholar at spelling or putting sentences together myself ( as you can probably tell ), but I manage to get my point across, and I WILL come to your aid when you need me. We need White warriors on our side, and I&rsquo;ll take them any way I can get them.    </p>

<p>Actually, this is a rather astute comment. </p>
<p>It seems as if third world populaces can raise their standards of living only with advanced civilizations providing the technology, the medicine, and food. This is so whether in black majority rule Africa, or the inner cities of North America and Western Europe. Third world populaces therefore must migrate into the advanced world to gain all the advantages of a modern standard of living. Either that, or crank up the propaganda machine to get advanced countries to subsidize them via aid for Haiti, Ethiopia, Detroit, or wherever. All this is made worse via Western elites who promote mass migrations, foreign aid, and multicultist indoctrination. </p>
<p>We can see the outcome in places like the new rainbow nation of South Africa. A minority of Whites (and perhaps some Indians) provide the tax and technological basis to keep an exploding black populace at some sort of level of existence. Remove those Whites, and you end up with a total collapse, ala Zimbabwe. </p>
<p>The reality has been that third world populaces are unable to sustain, much less create, a modern, advanced society. Perhaps this is owing to the usual factors of lower median IQ, or impulse control issues, or inability to think long term, or whatever. Regardless, we are seeing a decline of civilization where third world populaces displace advanced societies. </p>
<p>It should also be interesting to see as China becomes a superpower, how the Chinese plan to deal with third world depredations. </p>

		<p>What money are these Latinos living on? They operate on the &#8220;you can&rsquo;t get blood from a turnip&#8221; economic model.  In other words, show up at a hospital and don&rsquo;t pay the bill, stiff a landlord, cause an accident with no insurance, or don&rsquo;t pay child support.  There is no debtor&rsquo;s prison in America, but we can start by garnishing their SSI and foodstamps, put them in rooming houses instead of Section 8 apartments.  The only downside is that poor Americans, for whom these safety nets were originally invented, will suffer as well.  We have to turn off the spigot of welfare to these Latinos.  They are also gaming Social Security and Medicare.  Did you know that stepchildren and adopted children are now covered under Survivor&rsquo;s benefits?  They also father children near retirement age to get an additional check.  They bring their old folks here and put them on Medicare.  Hospitals in New Jersey have gone under because virtually no Latinos have private insurance. These changes in our laws have been enacted by the Democrats with Republicans going along to garner the Latino vote.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m totally opposed to illegal immigration and believe we have way too much of the legal variety as well, which hinders assimilation.  Furthermore, multiculturalism has at its heart a hatred of America, and the anti-American values taught in our schools by liberal administrators and teachers unfortunately corrupts the children, who grow to have a hatred of America.  This is what we&rsquo;re seeing here.</p>
<p>That said, the Pledge of Allegiance is strictly for American citizens only, not for foreign nationals.  It is inappropriate to make kids of another citizenship, including illegals, give a pledge of loyalty to the United States, as their loyalties should remain with their citizenship.  Now since we very well can&rsquo;t have just American students in the schools state the pledge while having the foreign nationals remain seated, I think we should no longer have the Pledge in our schools.</p>
<p>Yes, I miss the days such as when I was in elementary school when nearly all students were Americans and we could all stand and take the Pledge.  I wish we could return to them. But since we&rsquo;ve unfortunately decided to have the mass importation of foreign nationals in our schools, we do need to stop saying the Pledge of Allegiance  &mdash;  that&rsquo;s a pleasure/duty for Americans only.</p>

		<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that the Mexicans stole the land from the Spanish when they rebelled!  The Mexicans only owned it for about a dozen years, and they didn&rsquo;t settle it because the original owners, the Indians, were too fierce and beat back Mexican invaders every time.</p>
<p>The Mexicans were so afraid of Indians in the Southwest, that one of the stipulations in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which the Mexicans insisted on, was that the Americans would stop the Indian raids from the north. </p>
