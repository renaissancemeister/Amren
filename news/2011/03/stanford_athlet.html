<h1>Stanford Athletes Had Access to List of &#8216;Easy&rsquo; Classes</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Amy Julia Harris and Ryan Mac, California Watch, March 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A drama class in &#8220;Beginning Improvising&#8221; and another in &#8220;Social Dances of North America III&#8221; were among dozens of classes on a closely guarded quarterly list distributed only to Stanford athletes to help them choose courses.</p>
<p>Stanford officials said the list was designed to accommodate athletes&rsquo; demanding schedules and disputed that the list was made up of easy classes. Officials discontinued the list last week after student reporters working for California Watch began asking about it.</p>
<p>The list, which has existed at least since 2001, was widely regarded by athletes as an easy class list. More than a quarter of the courses on the list did not fulfill university general education requirements.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The classes on the list were &#8220;always chock-full of athletes and very easy A&rsquo;s,&#8221; added Kira Maker, a women&rsquo;s soccer player who used the list her freshman year.</p>
<p>Titled &#8220;courses of interest,&#8221; the list was distributed by the Athletic Academic Resource Center. Advisers in other departments at the university said they were unaware such a list existed.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But some faculty and students say the list may have offered an academic advantage for the athletes who requested it  &mdash;  especially since the general population was unaware it was even available. The Athletic Academic Resource Center didn&rsquo;t advertise the list or post it on its website. But athletes have been known to ask for it.</p>
<p>Athletes said they heard about the list by word of mouth or simply picked up the document at the resource center.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Before officials discontinued the list, Julie Lythcott-Haims, dean of freshmen and undergraduate advising, said with other scheduling resources available to all students, perhaps the list was &#8220;unnecessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Other professors were unconcerned that a class they taught made it onto the list. Some, in fact, said they believed student athletes should be treated differently than the typical student.</p>
<p>Stanford &#8220;accommodates athletes in the manner that they accommodate students with disabilities,&#8221; said Donald Barr, who teaches a course titled &#8220;Social Class, Race, Ethnicity, Health,&#8221; which was highlighted by resource center advisers.</p>
<p>Some faculty members said they didn&rsquo;t believe the list harmed anyone  &mdash;  and may have helped fill their classrooms.</p>

		<p>Way back in the 80&rsquo;s when I attended college, I took a fairly easy course in Phys. Ed.  A girl in the class - not an athlete - but a minority (hispanic) wrote a paper, as did everyone in the class, and got up and read it, as did everyone else.  She wrote about an athlete who had since retired and it was blatantly plagiarized.  She even gave outdated statistics for the since retired athlete.  It was apparent that she went to the library and copied it from something like Sport Illustrated.  I recognized the incorrect statistics almost immediately.  The teacher gave her an &#8216;A&rsquo; for the paper.  The teacher was no fool either.  She knew what this girl had done.  The college was here in NYC and the teacher was from the South.  It was obvious to me even then, that the teacher felt sympathy for this girl and gave her the &#8216;A&rsquo; when she should have given her an &#8216;F.  I have more than one story like this from my college days.  I didn&rsquo;t attend any Big Ten school either.  In many cases the non-Whites don&rsquo;t even have to be athletes; all they have to be is non-White, and their given unfair &#8220;breaks&#8221;.  Since this sort of thing was going on back then I can imagine what things are like today.  As a matter of fact back when I was in college because the borough that the college was located in was changing demographically and less Whites were attending, the school began to lower its entrance standards so that they wouldn&rsquo;t have to close their doors.  They even instituted remedial courses in English, Math and other subjects.  When I noticed these classes - even then as a teenager and young adult - I thought to myself, Beginning math?  What was grammar school and high school for???  Of course now I see what the real score is, where all this nonsense derived from and where it&rsquo;s going and who&rsquo;s behind it.  It is discouraging though because this favoritism not only in schools but in the workplace and literally everywhere for non-Whites seems almost unstoppable.  I&rsquo;ve awakened to it all and I think it&rsquo;s time all Whites awakened to it.</p>

<p>They could have taken nuclear physics and still received a passing grade, just as the black non-atheletes do.</p>
<p>I mean, we wouldn&rsquo;t want them rioting would we?  Don&rsquo;t we have to pretend they can accomplish something by fooling them into believing they did it all on their own, so they won&rsquo;t cause chaos and jeopardize all the fat cats&rsquo; assets?</p>

		<p>I think what should be discontinued are high school and college sports altogether. People seem to have completely forgotten why they send their children to school and college. I think some of these universities exist solely to field a team of some sort and make money through athletics. School sports teams used to be a way to build school spirit and burn off some energy. </p>
<p>I think its ridiculous that the local news spends 1 minute covering recent crimes in the area, 1 minute on the stock market, a couple of minutes on weather&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..then 15 minutes talking about the stupid high school sports teams in the area. Analysts discuss the teams performance, etc&hellip;.it is so crazy to me. The economy is tanking, people are losing jobs and homes&hellip;lives are falling apart.  But goodness, how are we looking for this years football teams? </p>
<p>Why not spend 15 minutes talking about the  latest test results from these schools. We have become a society of former high school &#8220;super-stars&#8221; that cannot read or do math. And as soon as those stars graduate from school, there are another 5 super-stars to take his place. </p>

		<p>I thought this was pretty standard at any college. When it comes to sports, the administrations will practically sell their souls to &#8216;keep up with the Jones&rsquo; involving competitive sports. </p>
<p>In high school, I let this black athlete cheat off my Spanish tests. He was a good athlete, a bit of a player; but I didn&rsquo;t care. He was nice enough while we knew of one another in high school. I was a cheerleader. He had had my mom for Spanish I. This was the second time he was taking Spanish II from another teacher. He needed two years of a foreign language to get into college. He played for the Gamecocks, but he didn&rsquo;t go pro. </p>
<p>I roomed with a guy in NC who had gotten a degree only because he went to jail for 7 years for dealing drugs to the &#8216;higher up&rsquo; clientele. He didn&rsquo;t understand how I could be so pissed that while my parents &amp; I planned and prepared for college all of my life with it being thrown off by a horrible life-change incident, but he just happened to get a college degree for free.</p>
<p>Life&rsquo;s not fair, but there is so much more to be upset over.  </p>

		<p>#2 - NYC resident:<br>
In the early 1970&rsquo;s I attended Hunter College in Manhattan.<br>
I noticed many loud and boisterous blacks in the hallways during class breaks, but almost none in any of my classes.<br>
One day when my class got out I followed the group of blacks in the hallway to their destination.  It was, by all appearances, just another class, but after talking to the instructor I learned that it was a remedial class, listed on the class schedule as 001 or 002.<br>
Any reader who has attended college will recognize right away that these are not college-level classes, and should more properly be taught in the adult education section of a high school, but, by having them under the same roof as my 200 to 400 level classes, it helps jack up the statistics of black enrollment, so LaVon and LeBron can call themselves &#8220;college students.&#8221;  Funny thing, before I could be admitted to Hunter I had to go back to my private high school, at the age of twenty-one, and complete Trigonometry, not having the cachet of having attended a New York City public school, which automatically bestows college admission to the student.<br>
This was forty years ago; I wonder what things are like now.</p>

		<p>This does surprise me somewhat coming from Stanford.  After all it is Stanford.  I worked as a teaching assistant while in grad school and discovered a &#8220;list&#8221; of professors who were favored for athletes because they would give a passing grade no matter what drivel they turned in.  Luckily the professor I worked for was not on it.  I would have had a hard time grading those papers all the while being expected to pass them.  In the TA office I chanced to glance at some of the papers my colleagues were grading.  Most of them looked like they could have been written by third graders.  With names like Jamal, Shurrell, and LaTonio I could guess what race the students were.  </p>

		<p>So what else is new?  Just about any college with a sports team has &#8220;jock&#8221; classes which assure a passing grade for anyone who drags themselves into class.<br>
Back in the &#8216;80&rsquo;s I had a basic economics which mostly consisted of junior high school algebra. I was sleeping while the athletes were struggling.</p>

		<p>My little daughter at Berkeley needed a science requirement so she signed up for an entomology class thinking it would be interesting.  Little did she know what was in store&hellip;</p>
<p>The name of the class turned out to be &#8220;Bugs and Society&#8221; and it was geared for student athletes, specifically the football variety.  LD said the football players sat in the back, in a pack, with blank stares on their faces.  She almost bolted after the first day but decided to stick it out for easy credit, the experience, storytelling opportunities and laughs.</p>
<p>LD said there was no textbook or note-taking and the professor spent most of the time writing the exact questions and answers to the next test on the board and then going over repeatedly &#8220;what was going to be on the next test.&#8221;   There were even tutoring session offered for those who had trouble memorizing the answers to the test.</p>
<p>The super dumbed-down &#8220;science&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t have been more blatant or easy but the football players (mostly black) still couldn&rsquo;t seem to regurgitate the test answers that were handed to them and mostly flunked the tests.  </p>
<p>We have had plenty of laughs from the stories about football players in &#8220;Bugs and Society&#8221;, but unfortunately, LD didn&rsquo;t learn any entomology.</p>
<p>The irony is that unlike Stanford, Cal hasn&rsquo;t won a Pac-10 championship since 1959.</p>

		<p>Yep, even though Stanford has academic minimums for everyone, there is still a huge difference between Whites and Blacks.  I worked as a pharmacist at a pharmacy close to Stanford.  Black students would forget to refill their asthma meds till in the midst of an asthma attack, not pick up their birth control pills even though insurance paid all but $5 of the cost, etc. etc.  White Stanford students rarely to never had these problems.</p>

		<p>This preferential treatment for minorities goes on all the time.  If you want to keep blacks out jest have an intelligence test.  <br>
<p><br>
I young man I know had to pass a test to get hired by AT&T.;  He said the test was very hard.  He is pretty smart.  He said the 25 or so people taking test were groaning and breaking pencils.  The top four out of the group would make it.  He was number four.<br>
<p><br>
AT&T; has blacks working with him at his job.  He and another white worker were talking about how difficult the test was.  They ask a black worker did he think the test was hard.  He said, &ldquo;What test?&rdquo; <br>

		<p>In my undergrad, I majored in Sports Management.  You would think this would be a popular major for athletes, and although it had a higher representation than the school in general, it was nothing spectacular.  The reason?  Strict admission into the program.  3.25 GPA, business minor classes, and tough biology, anatomy, and physiology.  </p>
<p>So, the athletes that did get in were whites  &mdash;  a couple football players, five or so baseball players, volleyball player, swimmer, tennis player&hellip;I can only hope the program keeps its tough admission standards.  Just because one is good at sports doesn&rsquo;t make one good at running a sports business, team, league, franchise, or organization.   </p>

		<p>Our daughter attended a small private Southern college.  The only way blacks could attend was through the mechanism of athletic &#8220;scholarships.&#8221;  They neither had the IQ nor the basic inclination to attend academically.  Without athletic set-asides, the university could never hope to admit any blacks, and therefore keep away a likely Federal discrimination lawsuit.  Also, those few blacks they did admit for athletic reasons allowed the liberal whites an opportunity to minority pander, assuage their liberal guilt, and generally feel both smug and superior as they could now consider themselves &#8220;down with the brown.&#8221;</p>

		<p>In all the essentials this is old news. Universities have spent the last several decades not merely cooking up easy classes for blacks but whole fields of &#8220;study&#8221;  &mdash;  &#8220;black&#8221; studies, &#8220;ethnic&#8221; studies, and so on  &mdash;  to accommodate the black intellectual incompetents federal mandates and the schools&rsquo; commitment to leftist ideology compelled them to admit. An added benefit (to them) has been the legion of otherwise unemployable black &#8220;scholars&#8221; retained in comfortable sinecures by these programs.</p>

I had the misfortune of having worked at Stanford for 2 years. The entire school revolves around a false image. They do have a few professors who are very intelligent. They also have a few students who are very intelligent, but most of the students are complete idiots in the common sense area. I remember one Chinese guy who couldn&rsquo;t figure out why a drill wouldn&rsquo;t cut a hole in a part he was making for a project. He had the drill in the chuck backwards. I told him the drill was backwards, so he reversed the spindle, not the drill. It still didn&rsquo;t work, so I had to show him which end goes into the chuck. There was another guy (I think from S. America) who wanted to drill a 1/4&#8221; hole, so he first used a 3/8&#8221; drill. When that made the hole too big, he tried the 1/2&#8221; drill. Confused why the hole wasn&rsquo;t getting smaller, he asked me if he should use a 5/8&#8221; drill. The excuse from the staff was that the kids couldn&rsquo;t understand the simple things because they were so smart. The staff is insane: Mostly Narcissists and Sociopaths. We had an Asian woman in some kind of human resource position. She was suppose to make sure the staff and students worked together, and had what they needed. She couldn&rsquo;t speak English, nor could she write. Her emails were useless. It took several people to figure out what she wanted, and when we figured it out, it was completely irrelevant to the school, the students, or us. Staff meeting were a joke.</p>
<p>I am currently taking an advanced English class (English 2) at a Junior College. Our first essay was due last week. I wrote 12 pages, and some black person wrote 3/4 of a page. I got 100%, and they got 30%. I do not understand how that black person even got past English 1. They were unqualified to take the class. I find a lot of black teachers will pass blacks with an &#8220;A&#8221; even thought they can&rsquo;t do the assignments. </p>

<p>You&rsquo;re apparently White.  My question would be, Why would you let a Black cheat off your exams when you were in high school?  My second question would be, Why would you room with a guy who you knew had a criminal record for dealing drugs?  The implication in your statement is that he was Black too.  And I get the impression that you did more than &#8220;room&#8221; with him.  Have you finally realized what the score is?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t care to say that I belong anywhere. I&rsquo;m as conservative as my 66-yr old father, not like most 33-yr old females. But, I was disappointed to read that one poster went to Harvard and another&rsquo;s child went to Berkley. Those are suppossed to be fine schools, but they&rsquo;re way too liberal &amp; expensive for my taste. </p>
<p>I graduated in the top of my class in high school. Spanish class was easy for me. I didn&rsquo;t offer to let the athlete cheat, but I didn&rsquo;t resist. I liked him as a person. Everyone did. I didn&rsquo;t care what color he was. I had black friends in school. (But, I did talk disparagingly about blacks in the company of white friends. I&rsquo;m from the South. My parents never used the n-word. They knew we&rsquo;d figure it out for ourselves.) I wanted him to be able to go to college. I knew he wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere after that. </p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know the guy in NC was a drug dealer until after I was his roommate. He lived in a nice complex. He was white. (No, I don&rsquo;t think we ever touched. I may have hugged him when we first met. I was only there a couple of months.) He sold drugs to white businessmen. But, with the life I&rsquo;ve lived ( I acquired a TBI on spring break of my senior year in high school.), I could tell by the things he said our first night spent talking, getting to know one another. He was shocked. He asked if I was psychic. I can read people very well. Other people have noticed this as well. I guess it&rsquo;s the gift that comes from being avoided, rejected, and left to myself for 15 years for my to become a good observer. I read a lot, too. </p>
<p>Life hasn&rsquo;t been handed to me. I wasn&rsquo;t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I&rsquo;ve experienced more than most could imagine. I&rsquo;m pretty unrelateable to most, not really belonging anywhere. I have a few people who I call friends that have always been friends. That&rsquo;s enough. You&rsquo;d never know anything had happened to me. Things have circled back around. I think most men think I&rsquo;m attractive. I won&rsquo;t spend my life striving for something that won&rsquo;t last anyway. I&rsquo;m not lazy. I just don&rsquo;t want what most who are just starting their lives want. I felt like my parents could have helped me more, but it&rsquo;s good that I learned for myself. I graduated from UGA (I paid for the second half after I lost the HOPE.) I owed it to myself and my parents. I own a house. I have a job. I have a relationship with God through Jesus Christ. I&rsquo;m content. </p>
<p>This may give you another perspective. No harm on this end. I understand.  </p>

		<p><i> But, I was disappointed to read that one poster went to Harvard and another&rsquo;s child went to Berkley. Those are suppossed to be fine schools, but they&rsquo;re way too liberal &amp; expensive for my taste</i></p>
<p>FYI:  Harvard is a private university, tuition is $36,992.00<br>
      UC Berkeley is a public university, tuition ~ $9,000</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s per year BTW.</p>
<p>The #1 student organization at Berkeley is Young Republicans.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I had the misfortune of having worked at Stanford for 2 years. The entire school revolves around a false image. They do have a few professors who are very intelligent. They also have a few students who are very intelligent, but most of the students are complete idiots in the common sense area. I remember one Chinese guy who couldn&rsquo;t figure out why a drill wouldn&rsquo;t cut a hole in a part he was making for a project. He had the drill in the chuck backwards. I told him the drill was backwards, so he reversed the spindle, not the drill. It still didn&rsquo;t work, so I had to show him which end goes into the chuck. There was another guy (I think from S. America) who wanted to drill a 1/4&rdquo; hole, so he first used a 3/8&rdquo; drill. When that made the hole too big, he tried the 1/2&rdquo; drill. Confused why the hole wasn&rsquo;t getting smaller, he asked me if he should use a 5/8&rdquo; drill. The excuse from the staff was that the kids couldn&rsquo;t understand the simple things because they were so smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be surprised (maybe not anymore!). A lot of these brainiacs do mostly bookwork and never touch a drill or other actual mechanical items. Probably blue-collar types have more practical experience with power tools than the lawyers&rsquo; and doctors&rsquo; kids at Stanford.</p>
<p>At least it means there will be plenty of jobs in trades&hellip;</p>

		<p>Back in 1972, I went to Temple in North Philly. There were remedial classes serving almost exclusively black students. There were security guards in most buildings. It was frightening for me  &mdash;  white girl from the &#8216;burbs. Fortunately for me, I did not encounter one black person in my classes during my junior and senior years, because of the academic demands. <br>
&hellip;1972. You could still smoke in class then&hellip; </p>
