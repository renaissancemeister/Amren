			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Life can be lonely on the high seas and one pirate has decided enough is enough, it&rsquo;s about time he got himself a wife.</p>
<p>But the Somali pirate chief has taken a fancy to his 13-year-old Danish hostage  &mdash;  and he is so besotted with her he&rsquo;s willing to let the rest of her family go free, and even forget the $5million dollar ransom his pirate colleagues demanded.</p>
<p>According to The Times, the pirate made the bizarre proposal during a conversation with a Danish reporter, who visited the African nation to track down the Johansen family who were taken hostage in the Indian Ocean more than a month ago.</p>
<p>Jan Quist Johansen, his wife Birgit Marie Johansen, their sons Rune and Hjalte and their daughter Naja, were kidnapped along with their two crewmen.</p>
<p>Their yacht was hijacked in the Indian ocean 260 miles from the coast just weeks from completing the end of their two-year voyage. They have been trapped on board the previously hijacked MS Dover, along with 20 other hostages, since February 24.</p>
<p>The reporter, from the tabloid Ekstra Bladet, was not allowed to speak to the family, but he spoke to the chief pirate who apparently revealed his plans for a bride. </p>
<p>The terrifying proposal puts more pressure on the authorities and hostage negotiators to free the family.</p>
<p>If the Danes give me permission to marry the girl, I will free the rest without any condition,&rsquo; Kristian Kornoe quoted the pirate chief as saying.</p>
<p>The reporter, who assumed the offer was never going to be accepted, said: &#8216;The father, Jan, seemed completely exhausted, even ill.</p>
<p>&#8216;The rest of the family is tired and angry. The smell is unbearable &hellip; it is hot, the water is filthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Henrik Ljung, a senior Danish psychologist, said &#8216;The offer of marriage was simply a way of applying psychological pressure, a show of force.</p>
<p>&#8216;It&rsquo;s an extremely effective tool if you want to raise money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Somali pirate Abdullahi Mohamed said earlier this month the gang responsible for the kidnap would kill all seven hostages if any attempt was made to rescue them.</p>
<p>The family, from Kalundborg, 75 miles west of Copenhagen, were planning to enter the Mediterranean through the Suez canal from the Red Sea.</p>
<p>That route would take the family through the Gulf of Aden, one of the most dangerous waterways in the world in terms of piracy.</p>
<p>It is the first time children have been captured.</p>
<p>Two days before they were captured Americans Jean and Scott Adam and Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were killed after their boats were seized by Somali pirates.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the Danish crew will be able to survive the ordeal as was the case with British couple Paul and Rachel Chandler, who were finally released in November 2010 after 388 days in captivity in return for a secret £625,000 ransom.</p>
<p>Earlier on the same day that the Danish vessel was captured, Somali pirates also hijacked a Greek-owned cargo vessel with 23 crew on board.</p>
<p>The MV Dover was seized in the north Arabian sea, 260 miles north-east of the Omani port of Salalah.</p>
<p>There are three Romanians, 19 Filipinos and a Russian aboard the Panama-flagged vessel.</p>

		<p>While the report is tragic, the idea that people are still sailing or cruising in the area begs the question; what the hell are you people thinking?  </p>
<p>Year after year we hear the same stories of Somalians kidnapping some moronic boaters who are sailing through their hunting grounds. Even commercial ships don&rsquo;t have a clue as they surrender their lives and cargo like sheep to the slaughter - all after they knowingly cruised through waters crawling with people who are known to kill at the drop of a hat. And a sensible person is supposed to continue to be outraged year after year?  Why? What&rsquo;s next; jogging through mine fields for exercise and fun, and doing so continuously until blown up? </p>
<p>Sorry, folks, but my sympathy for these willing victims is now down to &#8220;zero&#8221;.     </p>

Where is the combined strength of the US, Royal and EU Navies? Surely these disgusting lawless Muslim pirates (criminal gangs) could be put out of business in a few days and then some sort of interim administration installed in Somalia. After all the USA and NATO are already trying to do this in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the recent intervention in Lybia. </p>
<p>Is the pirate&rsquo;s ransom proposal absurd or naive? Not really, this is the way these people think. Mariage, often forced or arranged to a 13 year old (or younger) girl is quite normal in that part of the world.</p>
<p>A recent and horrible crime. A young lady (white) from Tasmania was murdered by her Somali boyfriend. Apparently he just lost his temper with her.<br>

		<p>Sorry, but I have lost almost all sympathy for these people that go yachting through the Suez Canal.  Arm yourself to the teeth or avoid it!  Its not hard.</p>
<p>I only feel sorry for the girl.  She never asked to be put in this situation and probably never heard of the pirates before she left for open waters with her parents.  Honestly I assumed the pirates were &#8220;marrying&#8221; captives all along.  It is the Muslim way.  But 13 sounds old for a devout Muslim, TBO.</p>

Make all these pirates swing, and there will be fewer White girls who share her fate.  </p>

		<p>I cannot vouch for the truth of this  &mdash;  just something I remember reading, and it makes sense.  I read somewhere, a long time ago, that when the PLO first started hijacking planes back in the 70&rsquo;s  &mdash;  their pre-&#8220;violent terrorism&#8221; days  &mdash;  they hijacked Israeli planes.  Israeli commandoes are said to have stormed the planes, killing all hijackers.  There was &#8220;collateral&#8221; damage  &mdash;  civilians killed.  But as soon as the savages realized that if they hijacked an Israeli plane, they&rsquo;d be killed en masse, they moved on to easier targets and stopped hijacking Israeli planes.  As I said, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or just some anecdote I read that &#8220;should be true.&#8221;  But that&rsquo;s how I would deal with these &#8220;pirates.&#8221;  I cannot believe that even a vacationing family could not fight off a boatload of &#8220;democrats&#8221; with two or three rifles between mom and dad and a 13 year old daughter.  Seriously, you usually hear that it&rsquo;s about four of these hoodlums in a small motorboat with a couple of AK 47&rsquo;s.  One shot per family member, properly trained with a decent rifle, would take care of them.  Let alone a tanker!  I still cannot comprehend how four of these impoverished miscreants can take a tanker hostage.  Can the capitalist pigs that own these vessels not afford a couple of rifles?</p>

		<p>Somalis have been bandits for centuries. They have always been thugs.  It&rsquo;s their way of life.  </p>
<p>Now, they have turned their efforts to the sea, where the pickings are inestimably greater than on land.  Thievery is all they know how to do.  Should this be any surprise?</p>

Sailors, primarily whites, travel the seas because the sea is the last bastion of freedom.</p>
<p>As a sailor, I could not refute the will of people to be there.<br>
However, if whites plan to sail, they must realize that they must be prepared to fight.</p>
<p>That means taking all precautions necessary to ensure a safe passage by posting a lookout(s), being a sharp navigator, positioning a sniper(s), and utilizing aluminum torpedoes for commercial use.</p>
<p>North and sub-Saharan Africans have been known to jettison logs into canal zones, liter the water and plant bombs in dead caracasses, and of course use rifles and RPG&rsquo;s so it would be imperative to avoid Yemen and the Gulf of Aden altogeather. </p>
<p>America&rsquo;s dillemma will only grow because piracy was born from globalism and globalism is that which every gangster benefits.</p>

		<p>For whatever reason it seems we are unable to kill blacks with military force no matter how justified such military action may be. We have zero compunction about slaughtering Pakistanis with predator drone strikes, killing dozens at a clip in mass extrajudicial killings via hellfire missiles, but we seem unwilling to harm a hair on a black pirate&rsquo;s head. </p>

Unleash Hell on them with one swift and incendiary attack to be continued until there is nothing left alive in their lairs; not even a fly. Annihilate every last one of them then make Mogadishu uninhabitable for the next three centuries.</p>

		<p>I remember reading about a Sardinian noblewoman (about the same age) captured in the early 1800s by pirates in Tunisia. The sultan made an ultimatum to the woman&rsquo;s family to either pay up her ransom, or he would &#8220;marry&#8221; her. Europeans were scandalized and angry, but paid up IIRC. So as a money-making scheme this wouldn&rsquo;t be new. Like the psychologist said, it could be a way to wear down resistance. I&rsquo;d be surprised if he&rsquo;d be so restrained and calculating though.</p>
<p>Maybe this &#8220;chief&#8221; wants to marry and steal his way into Europe? The rest of Africa&rsquo;s thieving leadership seem to always buy French villas.</p>

		<p>To the Somali, piracy is just doing business with the strange white man.</p>
<p>The correct response would be to take his entire village and clan into custody, and offer to exchange their lives for the hostages.</p>

But unfortunaately, times have changed. You cannot do that now when you have invited Muslims -  by the millions! - to come and live among you.  They would be assassinating the Royal Family, blowing up trains, rioting in the streets, creating mayhem. </p>

		<p>Is it stupid to go cruising in pirate-infested waters? Absolutely. Does that justify what the pirates do? Absolutely not. Some people have such a one-dimensional way of thinking. They think that if a victim - of anything, whether it be piracy, rape, assault, murder - is anything less than a saint, &#8220;they had it coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the mine comment - that dog don&rsquo;t hunt. A mine is an object. A tool. When triggered, it can&rsquo;t help but go off. It does not have free will. Somali pirates do have free will. They chose to kidnap people. They chose to murder those four Americans. That means they can be held accountable. To treat a Somali like a land mine is to let him get away with anything and everything.</p>
<p>While the stupidity of people who go cruising in pirate-infested waters disgusts me, the greatest part of my anger is reserved for the Somalis who commit the acts of piracy - and the governments who are fully capable of stopping them but do not.</p>

<p>Every kids knows that pirates were doing good money a few centuries ago. The only reason we didn&rsquo;t have pirates for the last 100 years was that they had no rights at all.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart once said: &#8220;Holy sh&hellip; even the UN, the liberal organization that wants to protect anyone, does not care about pirates. They have absolutely no rights at all.&#8221;<br>

		<p>This has reached the point of insanity. When the &#8220;pirates&#8221; are pictured, they look like a bunch of adolescent thugs. I have never been able to understand how a small boatload of these terrorists can overtake huge tankers or even small yachts. Why aren&rsquo;t people armed when they sail these dangerous waters and why can&rsquo;t the thugs be overwhelmed by the crew of larger vessels?<br>
Why not send troops to Somalia where the pirates orginate and wipe them out, if we really want to go to war? Leave the civil wars to the countries fighting them, and concentrate on this place where Americans have been murdered. Until then, unnecessary travel in those waters need to be avoided. That&rsquo;s as foolish as the students on spring break going into that other terrorist country, Mexico.</p>

<p>  &mdash;  Comment from Australia. </p>
<p>The US military should not be called on to rescue anyone who makes the idiot decision to sail through pirated-infested waters.</p>
<p>It is not the job of the US Government to rescue fools who put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way in areas or waters, international or otherwise, outside of US sovereign territory.</p>
<p>How many pirates should we kill and how should we do it?  How would we identify them?</p>
<p>Attack by air, as in Libya?  Has any war or battle been won by bombing from the air?  Would you be willing to risk your life in a ground war in Somalis fighting guerillas armed with automatic weapons because of someone else&rsquo;s stupidity?   Would you expect me to risk mine?  Who then?</p>
<p>&#8220;The only rational policy is that followed by the Royal Navy for centuries: Hunt them down and hang them. It&rsquo;s sad to see this Danish girl suffer, but that&rsquo;s her parents&rsquo; fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree that it&rsquo;s the parents&rsquo; fault for foolishly risking their daughter&rsquo;s life.  There is no excuse for such recklessness.</p>
<p>With that said, again it is not the job of the US government to hunt down and hang foreign pirates no matter their heinous crimes.</p>
<p>It is your job to either protect yourself with deadly force when knowingly entering dangerous, foreign territory or stay out of said territory.</p>
<p>The British military, by the way, was in the habit of marching into capitals and hanging the leaders of countries with whom they had disagreements; but as Somalia has no government per se, only anarchy, even this tactic would not work.</p>
<p>See Black Hawk Down for further information about fighting a guerrilla ground war in Somalia.</p>

		<p>June as to your question as to why most of the large commercial vessels are not armed it is because of deliberate policy by the shipping companies.  They don&rsquo;t want to shoulder the responsibility of how those weapons might be used.  You should also know that modern cargo vessels have very small crews, maybe 12 people on a large container ship and maybe less on a tanker.</p>
<p>Another factor for the shipping companies is that they have &#8220;outsourced&#8221; their labor just like other corporations so a vessel is crewed mostly by sailors from the Third World and often officered by a few Eastern Europeans.  I don&rsquo;t know of any cargo vessels that sail with European or American national crews.<br>
Personally if I was a captain from Poland I doubt I would trust some crew from Sri Lanka or India or whatever with weapons.</p>
<p>For the small vessels used for &#8220;pleasure cruising&#8221; having weapons on board can cause lots of problems and even arrest and imprisonment at some ports of call.  Many countries have strict gun laws so you have to decide if you want to risk their almost sure discovery at some hostile port of call or have the small comfort of a few small arms.</p>

		<p>The lesson we should learn from this is: some rapes are more equal than others. I just read that Alabama issued an apology to a black &#8220;victim&#8221; of an alleged white-on-black gang rape 67 years ago. I have heard nothing about this case in the US media. Barring deaths, I expect to hear nothing of it. And even should death result, I doubt the sexual issue will be mentioned.</p>

		<p>21 Jack Parsons: It is and has always been the policy of the United States that all people from all countries have the right to sail in international waters, which means three miles off any coast, or closer if necessary to get to where you&rsquo;re going, such as passing through Turkish waters to enter or leave the Black Sea.  (We do recognize other countries&rsquo; exclusive fishing zones, up to 200 miles off their coasts.) That&rsquo;s why we allowed the Soviet Navy to loiter off our naval bases, in recognition of the principle of freedom of navigation.  And that&rsquo;s why the suppression of piracy in international waters is the business of the U.S. Navy, and all navies.  What they do onshore to their own people is not our business, but once they get three miles offshore, they have entered the civilized world and need to act like it.</p>

		<p>It would be so incredibly easy (and fun) to quickly end this piracy, by simply trolling.  All that needs to be done is to arm and armor a rotating group of commercial and private ships and equip them with USA Seals.  These fake ships could stop in various nearby ports and the &#8220;sailors&#8221; could go to bars and brag about their valuable cargo and their itineraries (i.e., chum).  Then when they are attacked, they simply kill all the attackers, sink their boats, and sail on.  Radar and satellites could identify mother ships, which should likewise be sunk, with no prior communication nor quarter given.  </p>
<p>After 1 year, when not a single pirate ship has returned to its home port, these thugs will get the message. </p>
<p>We could also do what they did to some bank robbers once in Papua New Guinea:  After killing them, they dropped them from 200 ft from a helicopter into the middle of town, where they lie rotting for days, as a reminder to others who might have a proclivity to stray from the law.    </p>
<p>As long as we continue to be &#8220;touch-freely&#8221; about this issue, piracy will continue.  If you want to end the brutality of piracy, then you need to apply brutality to pirates. </p>

<p>In a similar incident, a French family was taken hostage in the area a while ago. French special forces mounted a sophisticated operation to rescue them. During the assault of the yacht, the commandos accidentally shot and killed one of the hostages. </p>
<p>However, even after the tragic end of their adventure, the sailing family insisted that it was their Marx-given right to travel through this dangerous area in order to engage with poor downtrodden Africans. </p>
<p>Even the pirates kept eliciting their sympathy, and they referred to them as &#8220;fishermen unable to make a living in the depleted waters&#8221;   &mdash;   presumably by the evil white Western man.</p>
<p>Really, leftists are hopeless. Provided a non-white thug holds the blade, they would still find excuses for him at the very moment he would be slashing their throat. Those are diseased people.</p>

		<p>I have to say I am disappointed in many of the posts here. People should be able to sail where they like with out fear of piracy in this century. It is our cowardly governments and the liberal citizenship who allow these miscreants to flourish. </p>
<p>We all know the answer to solving this seemingly difficult(for the US, UN, EU, ETC.) problem. Destroy and kill every pirate and pirate enabler in the country and the area.</p>
<p> Do Not! Set up a puppet government, do not give aid, and for God&rsquo;s sake do not occupy the area. Every time there is an incident set the Armed Forces on them and kill as many people, break as much stuff, and confiscate all weapons and vehicles. Done problem solved I&rsquo;m sure after the first time piracy in the region would not exist. </p>

		<p>From post # 27 &#8220;Ten captured Somali piracy suspects are thought to have died after the Russian navy released them in an inflatable boat without navigational equipment.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Hats off to the Russians, who know how to &#8220;reform&#8221; pirates.   I suspect that their method results in an extremely low rate of recidivism.</p>
<p>Here is what I want to hear from OUR Navy: &#8220;Unfortunately, during their attempt to capture the commercial ship, none of the pirates survived. Their mother ship also apparently developed a leak and sank, with all aboard presumably lost.  In other news,  the home villages and docked ships of the pirates were destroyed in a series of massive, unexplained explosions, which seemed to come out of nowhere.  In nearby villages, many &#8220;fisherman&#8221; have taken up new careers in farming.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Thank you for the feedback.  However:</p>
<p>Just as Letters of marque won&rsquo;t work (as introduced in congress in 2007), sending in the US Military is not the answer.  It is horribly expensive, not cost-effective and would be akin to swatting at mosquitos on the open ocean, the reaction time too great in such a vast expanse.</p>
<p>The only viable option is that shipping companies willing to sail in pirate-infested waters must be willing to bring on board contracted maritime security companies for voyages around the Horn of Africa to combat those who bring violence upon their crews.</p>
<p>This is a case where violence must be met with violence   &mdash;    terms the Somali pirates understand.  Let it be known widely that any small craft seen as threatening and that comes within 1000 yards of any vessel on the open seas risks being fired upon without mercy and sent to the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>As for those who venture around the Horn of Africa on private yachts:  Call the Darwin Awards!</p>

		<p>34 Jack Parsons: Why haven&rsquo;t shipping companies hired ex-military gunmen?  Are they afraid of escalating violence, with pirates using exocet missiles or something?  Or can they not enter European ports with weapons aboard?  <br>
     I still like the idea of suitably disguised and armed small craft.  We&rsquo;ve so large a navy, with so many young officers who need real fighting experience.  Repelling boarders with cutlasses and miniguns should do a lot to sort out the Halseys from the desk sailors.</p>

     It may well be that there is no other source of livelihood.  Africa&rsquo;s population has outgrown their resources.  (That is, the resources they are capable of managing themselves.)  If piracy is the alternative to starvation, then starvation is the alternative to piracy.  There&rsquo;s no way out for them, and no pleasant way out for the West.  Protect out own, turn our eyes, and let nature take its course.  </p>

		<p>Like everyone else, I&rsquo;m attracted to the ideas of poster #27  &mdash;  send out decoy ships, manned by SEALs, and set rumors going about the value of its cargo. Reminds me of what the Detroit police department used to do (before the riots)  &mdash;  send a heavily armed cop, disguised as an old lady, into a neighborhood that had experienced an alarming number of muggings. Muggers attempting to take on the old lady were blown to bits. Did a lot to lower the crime rate.</p>

		<p>It is like &#8220;schoolteacher&#8221; says, hunt them down and hang them if the various navies had adopted that policy they would have ended the pirate threat in 2 weeks. The stupidity of these pirates amazes me, they actually attacked a Indian destroyer last year, oh look a grey ship lets shoot at it.  With predictable results of course. What we need are a modern variant of Mungo Herdman or Robert Meynard.</p>

  If they resist they can be landed by helicopter in the Somali desert with bottles of water.</p>

<p>I agree. Somalis live in a barren desert area which is incapable of sustaining a large population - and yet they have one of the world&rsquo;s highest birth rates!!!  That should not be our problem, and we shouldn&rsquo;t let it be.   As you say, let Nature take its course (which means Malthus). We should not be responsible for their improvidence.  </p>
<p>But our European/Christian traditions   (all just  silly nonsense to them!)&hellip; say that we are our brother&rsquo;s keeper. So we import them, and in doing so we pay for our own dispossession.</p>
