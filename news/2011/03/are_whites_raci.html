<h1>Are Whites Racially Oppressed?</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John Blake, CNN, March 4, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;We went from being a privileged group to all of a sudden becoming whites, the new victims,&#8221; says Charles Gallagher, a sociologist at La Salle University in Pennsylvania who researches white racial attitudes and was baffled to find that whites see themselves as a minority.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have this perception out there that whites are no longer in control or the majority. Whites are the new minority group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Call it racial jujitsu: A growing number of white Americans are acting like a racially oppressed majority. They are adopting the language and protest tactics of an embattled minority group, scholars and commentators say.</p>
<p>They point to these signs of racial anxiety:</p>
<p>* A recent Public Religion Research Institute poll found 44% of Americans surveyed identify discrimination against whites as being just as big as bigotry aimed at blacks and other minorities. The poll found 61% of those identifying with the Tea Party held that view, as did 56% of Republicans and 57% of white evangelicals.</p>
<p>* More colleges are offering courses in &#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221; as white Americans cope with becoming what one commentator calls a &#8220;dispossessed majority group.&#8221;</p>
<p>* A Texas group recently formed the &#8220;Former Majority Association for Equality&#8221; to offer college scholarships to needy white men. Colby Bohannan, the group&rsquo;s president, says white men don&rsquo;t have scholarship options available to minorities. &#8220;White males are definitely not a majority&#8221; anymore, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>* Fox talk-show host Glenn Beck led a march on Washington (attended primarily by white people) to &#8220;restore honor,&#8221; and once called President Obama a racist with a &#8220;deep-seated hatred for white people and white culture.&#8221; He later said he regretted making that comment.</p>
<p>* Conservative news outlets ran a number of stories last summer highlighting an incident from the 2008 elections, in which activists from the New Black Panther Party appeared to be intimidating voters at a polling place. Those claims were never proven.</p>
<p>Mass rallies in Washington, voter intimidation at the polls, creating ethnic studies programs at colleges to promote racial self-awareness  &mdash;  it sounds like a script from a civil rights documentary.</p>
<p>But not everyone buys that script. Mona Charen, a conservative columnist for the National Review, challenges that view with this question: If more white Americans feel like an embattled minority, why did they elect President Barack Obama?</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they become racist after electing the first black president?&#8221; she asks.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The proof, she says, isn&rsquo;t just in the fact that the nation elected its first black president. She cites the rise of more interracial couples.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I grew up, it was incredibly rare to see interracial couples,&#8221; she says. &#8220;People would turn their heads on the streets. Now it&rsquo;s so common that no one notices it anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>When white is no longer the norm</b></p>
<p>The notion that many white Americans feel anxious about their race is not new. Today, however, economic anxieties are feeding those racial fears, says Tim Wise, author of &#8220;White Like Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many white Americans have lived under the assumption that if they worked hard, they would be rewarded. Now more white Americans are sharing unemployment lines with &#8220;those people&#8221;  &mdash;  black and brown, Wise says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Economic insecurity is what Colby Bohannan says convinced him to form the &#8220;Former Majority Association for Equality.&#8221; The association is awarding $500 scholarships to five deserving white men because they aren&rsquo;t eligible for scholarships reserved for women and minorities, he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some white Americans not only feel ignored in higher education; they feel excluded by popular culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>This racial unease is more pronounced among older white Americans, who grew up in an era where America&rsquo;s icons were virtually all white, Wise says. </p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that we&rsquo;re losing our country is something that&rsquo;s not going to have a lot of resonance for someone under 30,&#8221; Wise says. &#8220;These are white folks who don&rsquo;t remember the country that their parents are talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221; began popping up in a few isolated academic institutions in the 1990s. Now such programs can be found in places such as the University of Wisconsin and the University of Utah. These courses examine what whiteness has meant during different periods of American history.</p>
<p>For many decades, white people saw themselves as individuals, not as members of a race, says Matt Wray, a sociologist at Temple University in Pennsylvania, who writes books about white studies.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Diversity is not strength&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Some white commentators are unapologetic about this racial anxiety.</p>
<p>Peter Brimelow, author of &#8220;Alien Nation: Common Sense About America&rsquo;s Immigration Disaster,&#8221; asserts that much of white America&rsquo;s anxiety derives from living under a black president and changing demographics.</p>
<p>Diversity, he says, &#8220;is not strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Some may see him as extreme, but Brimelow argues in his columns that more white Americans are moving toward his stance on immigration and other issues.</p>
<p>He cites as proof the rise of the Tea Party movement and the racial makeup of Beck&rsquo;s march on Washington. He says more whites recognize, even if it&rsquo;s only on a subliminal level, that they have common interests to defend.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>James Edwards, host of the &#8220;Political Cesspool&#8221; radio show, isn&rsquo;t shy about naming those interests. He says white Americans have become the &#8220;dispossessed majority&#8221; and that coming demographic changes may turn the United States into a &#8220;Third-World flop-house.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing wrong for Jewish organizations to promote the self-interest of Jews or black organizations to promote the interest of blacks,&#8221; he says. &#8220;There is no organization to stand up to advance the interests of the dispossessed majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those white interests have been compromised by what he sees as the &#8220;preferential treatment&#8221; blacks have received in the job market to compensate for slavery, Edwards says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Both Brimelow and Edwards reject outright the Southern Poverty Law Center&rsquo;s description of their organizations as extremist.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;It&rsquo;s not a race issue, it&rsquo;s a principle&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Ginger Howard is a white Southerner who doesn&rsquo;t feel dispossessed. She attended Beck&rsquo;s rally last summer and described it as a religious event, not a political one.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s not a race issue, it&rsquo;s a principle issue,&#8221; says Howard, owner of the Ginger Howard Selections clothing store in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>Chris Plante, a conservative talk show host, says white racial anxiety isn&rsquo;t a race issue but a smokescreen by leftists. Plante says they yell racism to avoid talking about Obama&rsquo;s &#8220;unpopular liberal expansion&#8221; of the federal government.</p>
<p>Plante, who says he grew up in a Chicago home with a picture of Martin Luther King Jr. on the wall, attended both Beck&rsquo;s rally and a follow-up rally by Jon Stewart, host of the Daily Show.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The Beck crowd was no more white than the Jon Stewart rally, but nobody in the news media described the Stewart crowd as overwhelmingly white,&#8221; Plante says.<br>

		<p>Disingenuous &amp; tendentious. CNN gives the impression  &#8220;whiteness studies&#8221; are pro-white counterpart to black or chicano studies when they are actually anti-white. Brimelow &amp; Edwards are slimed as &#8220;hate group&#8221; members while Tim Wise, he who looks forward to whites dying en mass to make way for multiculturalism, is cited as an expert. And the final say is given to a sociologist who says &#8220;it&rsquo;s the right thing that America becomes [majority] brown &amp; yellow.&#8221; Another hit piece &#8220;debunking&#8221; white concerns. </p>

		<p>For starters, the clueless, white, Democratic Party voting, guilt ridden liberal has to be enlightened. </p>
<p>The white vote must be taken away from the Democratic Party. It should not be that difficult, so why is the GOP refusing to play that card?<br>

<p>Beck was right.  We all know Obama feels the &#8220;racial angle&#8221; to the Tea Party movement according to a new book.  In fact, O is kind of right.  Traditional white values   &mdash;   hard work, rugged individualism, religious and economic freedoms   &mdash;   this is the central aspect to the Tea Partiers.  To be certain, a few noted blacks agree with these ideals (God bless them), but most blacks and minorities do not.  They want handouts and cry racism whenever whites dare vote for their interests.</p>
<p>The Repubs won 60% of the white vote in November.  This is unprecedented.  Even moderate whites understand the crisis, however they do not know the reason.  Quasi-socialist states in Western and Northern Europe are better places to live in than anarchist states overrun by Mexicans and blacks.  Solve the demographic problem, and the economic problem will take care of itself. </p>

<p>Did you guys catch that bit? CNN is trying to play &#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221; as helping whites cope with being a &#8220;dispossessed majority group&#8221; when everyone already knows &#8220;Whiteness Studies&#8221; were designed to incite hatred against whites. Things like that are part of the reason whites are oppressed.</p>

		<p>I was expecting the usual pablum when I started reading the article, but I was pleasantly surprised to see Peter Brimelow and James Edwards given space to comment. Of course, the writing is in that slightly condescending, smarmy tone that is used to let the reader know that the author does not take White oppression seriously, especially near the beginning of the essay.</p>

		<p>What frosts me the most about this article is that CNN is throwing Glenn Beck and James Edwards into the same box.  Beck is an egalitarian, and Edwards obviously believes in racial differences.  IOW, Beck sees 2 and 2 in front of him and spouts off about MLK, while Edwards sees 2 and 2 in front of him and adds them together to make the obvious four.</p>
<p>I read JE&rsquo;s &#8220;TPC&#8221; blog regularly, and while I don&rsquo;t agree with everything on it, the irony of this CNN article is that JE&rsquo;s article/blog post after the Beckapalooza back in late August, exposing its racial silliness, is the best thing JE ever wrote in any medium.  In fact, AR covered it as a news story in its own right.</p>
<p>If CNN has an ulterior motive here, it&rsquo;s to try and make Beck out to be the same kind of &#8220;racist&#8221; as James Edwards.</p>
<p>To address a few other things:  Whiteness studies courses in colleges are anti-white, not pro-white.  The &#8220;scholarship&#8221; for white men, you can be as little as 25% white and get it, and the scholarship trustees denounce &#8220;white racism,&#8221; bone-headedly.</p>

		<p> The writer reports, accurately enough, about the rise of White nationalism, or race realism, call it what you will, in the U.S.; but does so with thinly veiled editorial comments that imply such a notion as Whites being under any threat, or having been the victims of ANYTHING, is bizarre, bigoted, &#8220;thinly-veiled racism,&#8221; or fill in the blank with your favorite liberal cliche.</p>
<p> CNN&rsquo;s article cites the usual unimpeachable authority, the Southern Poverty Law Center, in referring to Peter Brimelow and James Edwards as some kind of &#8220;White racists,&#8221; without, apparently, even checking on the SPLC&rsquo;s own highly questionable credentials.</p>
<p> Mona Charen, who ought to know better, is quoted (approvingly) as saying that White Americans &#8220;elected Barack Obama president&#8221; (no, we didn&rsquo;t; only 43 percent of us voted for him); and that mixed-race couples are now so common that &#8220;nobody notices any more.&#8221; Excuse me, Ms. Charen, but many, many White Americans still notice, and many, many of us don&rsquo;t approve. </p>

		<p>I suspect the CNN types are starting to realize that they cannot simply continue to mock away and dismiss the claims that Whites are indeed being oppressed by a broader government, media, academic and  entertainment establishment that has unofficially declared that Whites are the enemy of the &#8220;new&#8221; America. They know it is true, of course, as they themselves have been active participants in this ideological ethnic-cleansing!!  </p>

		<p>&#8220;A growing number of white Americans are acting like a racially oppressed majority.&#8221;</p>
<p>No acting is necessary.</p>
<p>White Americans ARE a racially oppressed majority. For example, stick-it-to-the-white-male IS the operating principle of America&rsquo;s elite universities as regards admissions decisions: </p>
<p>&#8220;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>SOURCE: &#8220;How Diversity Punishes Asians, Poor Whites and Lots of Others&#8221;<br>

<p>&#8220;Stick to the white male&#8221; is also the essence of the government schools&rsquo; approach to history and literature.  New York University education historian Diane Ravitch:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;we&rsquo;ve gone from one extreme [uncritically teaching a common American culture &lsquo;that had a strong grounding in English literature and western European history&rsquo;] to the other. Instead of a simplistic patriotism, we have in our public schools an adversarial culture, a treatment of American history that emphasizes the nation&rsquo;s warts and failings and diminishes its genuine accomplishments &hellip; Groups like the National Council of the Social Studies [organization for social studies teachers] periodically express hostility to history as a field of study, worrying that it is by nature conservative, even jingoistic &hellip;&rdquo;<br>
(Ex Uno Plures, Education Next, Fall, 2001)<br>
<a href="http://educationnext.org/ex-uno-plures/" rel="nofollow">http://educationnext.org/ex-uno-plures/</a></p>
<p>Ravitch uses the voluminous &ldquo;bias and sensitivity&rdquo; guidelines of textbook publishing giant McGraw-Hill to illustrate how the diversity ideology is implemented in the production of textbooks: </p>
<p>&ldquo;The MH [McGraw-Hill] guidelines express barely concealed rage against people of European ancestry. They deride European Americans for exploiting slaves, migrant workers, and factory labor; they excoriate the land rapacity of the pioneers and mock their so-called courage in fighting Native Americans: &lsquo;Bigots and Bigotry,&rsquo; say the guidelines, referring to European Americans, &lsquo;must be identified and discussed.&rsquo; European Americans, the guidelines suggest, were uniquely responsible for bigotry and exploitation in all human history &hellip;&rdquo; (THE LANGUAGE POLICE, 2003, p. 44) </p>
<p>Note: ALL publishers of textbooks hoping to market to government  schools must engage in pre-emptive censorship by means of such &ldquo;bias and sensitivity&rdquo; guidelines.</p>

		<p>As a white male, I have personally witnessed the discrimination growing over the past 20 years.  Back in the 80s we still lived in America.</p>
<p>Fast forward now, and city governments, big companies, colleges are all falling all over themselves to hire or bring on board every minority they can.  White women get the pass too as surrogate competent whites.  It&rsquo;s just the white men who are excluded.  </p>
<p>I work for the city where I&rsquo;m at.  The only whites who get a free pass out here are the Italians, and they are very, very ethnic and cultural - not at all Mayflower Americans, or I see American jews, who are well entrenched, and they are all very leftist.</p>
<p>Other than that, pretty much every position from high and low, especially high, is filled with a black or latino of either gender.  I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I saw a white, male, anglo-saxon American in a position of authority.</p>
<p>I had a black supervisor who made no secret of his disdain for whites and he made our lives a living hell.  I escaped thank God.  I have several latino bosses, supervisors and other authority figures above me.  It&rsquo;s like I live in Latin America!  When I go outside, I see 95% non-whites everywhere I go, mind you it was almost all white here 30 years ago.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know my own country anymore.</p>

		<p>While the piece is obviously anti-white and pushes a leftist agenda, it is not nearly as badly skewed as one would usually expect. Tim Wise doesn&rsquo;t get the sole or last word, as he usually does. The very fact that the concept of the oppression of whites is seen as a subject worthy of &#8220;mainstream&#8221; news attention is a step in the right direction. VDARE is a good entry point for racial agnostics to begin to consider these matters. Its anti-immigration theme will resonate with many whites who are only dimly aware of what&rsquo;s happening to their country.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s encouraging to see the use of the word &#8220;white,&#8221; referring to race, in at least a neutral manner by a liberal institution like CNN. For too long, the term &#8220;white&#8221; has been slandered as merely a term used by national socialists (the presumption being that the mere association with national socialism would somehow discredit the term   &mdash;   and for much of brainwashed public, duped to see national socialism as some kind of metaphysical evil, it probably did).</p>
<p>What I find most galling is that neither Brimelow nor Edwards were given the chance to slam the SPLC for the transparently cultural-Marxist, anti-white organization that it is. That will be an important step forward   &mdash;   when the SPLC is roundly discredited in mainstream discourse as any kind of quotable or credible authority in these discussions.</p>

  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  Forwarded Message  &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;    &mdash;  </p>
<p>From a chain email:</p>
<p>Russell K. Nieli recently brought to light a new study by Princeton sociologist Thomas Espenshade and his colleague Alexandria Radford that shows that lower-income European Americans (poor whites) are the most discriminated against group of people in college admissions.</p>
<p>Nieli writes: &#8220;When lower-class whites are matched with lower-class blacks and other non-whites the degree of the non-white advantage becomes astronomical: lower-class Asian applicants are seven times as likely to be accepted to the competitive private institutions as similarly qualified whites, lower-class Hispanic applicants eight times as likely, and lower-class blacks ten times as likely. These are enormous differences and reflect the fact that lower-class whites were rarely accepted to the private institutions Espenshade and Radford surveyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Get that? Not African Americans, not Mestizo Americans   &mdash;  - but European Americans are the most discriminated against group in college admissions.</p>
<p>This widespread discrimination against European Americans should be unsurprising. And immigration is making it worse, as more non-whites immigrate here their &#8220;disparate impact&#8221; status makes them prime affirmative action candidates.</p>
<p>All other racial groups have powers lobbying on their behalf. Blacks have the NAACP, mestizos have La Raza, Asians have the 80-20 Initiative, Indians have USINPAC, etc. What do European Americans have?</p>
<p>When other groups lobby on behalf of their ethnic interests and whites do nothing, whites are bound to receive the short end of the stick. And all the while this is taking place, many whites pursue the &ldquo;ostrich strategy&rdquo;. They stick their heads in the sand and wish it were otherwise.</p>
<p>Time to take your heads out of the sand, white people.<br>

		<p>Yes whites are racially oppressed, and it&rsquo;s soon going to get much worse. Arguably genocide is already  being committed against us by virtue of the huge numbers of non-white rapes and murders against us, the fact whites are forced to support hostile alien&rsquo;s reproduction at their expense, and the fact we have no legal rights. Soon organized murder campaigns might be added to the list. We are oppressed right now, and it&rsquo;s time whites start to realize that dispossession in one&rsquo;s own land requires them to take action, now lest they find themselves the new blacks in Amerika.</p>

<p>I agree that white elites are at the crux however that doesn&rsquo;t alleviate non whites and their responsibility in any of this. It is also more than just a nuisance as race does matter to them as much as it should matter to us.</p>

<p><br>
Sure it is more common, but I still turn my head in disbelief.  Most white Americans still find it appalling.  Mona Charen should try talking to a white American sometime, instead of talking for them.</p>

		<p>Where to begin? There&rsquo;s so much nonsense in this article, it&rsquo;ll win a Pulitzer Prize!</p>
<p>Only a liberal sociologist would feel baffled that whites might feel they are being dispossessed. How could that be? Don&rsquo;t you know every white receives preferential treatment from schools as a child? Or that whites have scholarships coming out of the woodworks for them to go to college? Or that the Universities are, in defiance of the law, using all manner of underhanded measures to give an extra leg up at recruitment time to whites? Similarly that employers also are giving preferential treatment to whites for both employment, and in decisions about who to retain when layoffs are necessary? That the Universities and Society at large are full of whites-only organizations and organizations designed to promote white interests and benefits? Don&rsquo;t you know blackness studies are really just a hate blacky program in disguise? Don&rsquo;t you know that the schools and the media teach white unity and that whites are deserving of special privilege, while teaching that minorities are evil, cowardly, thieving and behind every problem both past and present in the world? You didn&rsquo;t? What are you, some kind of ***(look of terror)** RACIST?<br>

		<p>As the country continues its downward spiral more and more whites will be complaining and taking to the streets, so the above CNN dreg will have a lot of material to &#8220;reveal&#8221; about how whites are reacting to the destruction of their country, their traditions, culture and history, but especially he will be able to recount how whites will be uniting under policies that will continue to grow that disfavors them and offer even more non-white privileges.</p>
<p>The protests will begin as opposition to cutbacks via austerity measures, as in Wisconsin and Ohio, and revolts against higher taxes, but they will evolve into racial issues, because, ultimately, that is the basis for most all the problems in this country.  From that point, there will more open conflict, because there will be no stopping the social and economic degeneration of this failed empire.  The game is over.</p>

		<p>There is a prior question that must first be asked and it is this:Are high fertility post-1965 Hispanics,Muslims,Asians,Carribeans,Africans, the &#8220;American Left, White Liberals, Republican and Democratic party insiders and CEO of Corporations waging a vicious race war against the Native Born White American Majority? Obviously yes. And this vicious race war is being implemented through post-1965 legal immigration policy which began with the passage of the 1965 Immigration Reform Act.</p>
<p>Native Born White Americans are increasing feeling like racial foreigners within the borders of America..a nation founded by Whites and built by Whites. And in the process of making Native Born White Americans an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of &#8220;America&#8221;. Native Born White Americans are increasingly subject to discrimination and racial violence at the hands of post-1965 high fertility nonwhites and also having what ever wealth they have left being transfered away to the very greedy cheating class. And the greedy cheating class-CEO of corporations- is using  this stolen wealth to emasculate and demonize Native Born White American Males-on a regular basis these days-in TV commercials. It is now common on TV commercials to pair White Women with Black Males, and  at the same time mock the intelligence of Native Born White American Males-along with a heavy dose of emasculation thrown in for good measure. A very hostile environment has been created for millions of Native Born White Males. What happens when high fertility post-1965 nonwhites are the majority in the military and police departments around the nation? Everyone knows the obvious answer to this question. The evidence is obvious that Native Born White Americans are being racially oppressed&hellip;It&rsquo;s all very out in the open about these days. </p>

The only fact that whites have to consider very seriously is how they can maintain their power in their own lands before it&rsquo;s too late and much more difficult to regain the standard that they set which the whole world benefits from. It&rsquo;s the responsibility of whites to make sure another Dark Ages never happens.</p>

<p>Truly ye come of The Blood; slower to bless than to ban; <br>
Little used to lie down at the bidding of any man. <br>
Flesh of the flesh that I bred, bone of the bone that I bare; <br>
Stark as your sons shall be   &mdash;   stern as your fathers were. <br>
Deeper than speech our love, stronger than life our tether, <br>
But we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together. <br>
My arm is nothing weak, my strength is not gone by; <br>
Sons, I have borne many sons, but my dugs are not dry. <br>
Look, I have made ye a place and opened wide the doors, <br>
That ye may talk together, your Barons and Councillors   &mdash;   <br>
Wards of the Outer March, Lords of the Lower Seas, <br>
Ay, talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees!   &mdash;   <br>
That ye may talk together, brother to brother&rsquo;s face   &mdash;   <br>
Thus for the good of your peoples   &mdash;   thus for the Pride of the Race. <br>
Also, we will make promise. So long as The Blood endures, <br>
I shall know that your good is mine: ye shall feel that my strength is yours: <br>
In the day of Armageddon, at the last great fight of all, <br>
That Our House stand together and the pillars do not fall. <br>
Draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands, <br>
And the Law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands. <br>
This for the waxen Heath, and that for the Wattle-bloom, <br>
This for the Maple-leaf, and that for the southern Broom. <br>
The Law that ye make shall be law and I do not press my will, <br>
Because ye are Sons of The Blood and call me Mother still. <br>
Now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you, <br>
After the use of the English, in straight-flung words and few. <br>
Go to your work and be strong, halting not in your ways, <br>
Balking the end half-won for an instant dole of praise. <br>
Stand to your work and be wise   &mdash;   certain of sword and pen, <br>
Who are neither children nor Gods, but men in a world of men! <br>

<p>1) Discriminate against whites by requiring them to have higher test scores than applicants from &#8220;disadvantaged minorities&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Force whites to attend courses and workshops indoctrinating them into the belief that WHITES benefit from racial discrimination in all walks of life</p>
<p>3) Punish white students who point out the blatant contradiction between 1) and 2) (but his say, who talk about REALITY).</p>

<p>And it is indeed masochistic, suicidal whites were doing this  to themselves - the so-called &#8220;disadvantaged minorities&#8221; would never have had the perverted ingenuity to come up with the idea of destroying the greatest university system on earth by REJECTING talented whites from POOR families in favor of excepting frighteningly stupid minorities from well-to-do families - and calling that &#8220;progressive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not where I work (inner-city Connecticut). For my job you need a Master&rsquo;s Degree or other special skills. So out of 40+ employees at my workplace, four are black. The last four hires were 3 White males and 1 White female. Our boss is an Irish-American male (very pro-White) but does want to hire more Spanish speakers since the community is 30% Puerto Rican. Problem: few hispanics have Master&rsquo;s Degrees or can pass the tests for non-Master&rsquo;s positions. I hear the same thing from the local police: They would hire more blacks &amp; hispanics but most of them just don&rsquo;t have the skills, education, psychological make-up, or clean criminal records to cut it.<br>

<p>It is sickening. So much sympathy for a race-Blacks-who voted overwhelmingly for a president who wants to  race-replace the Native Born White Majority of America with high-fertility post-1965 nonwhites. But if this induces deep digust with Engleman&rsquo;s comments, the fact that numbersusa.com..and vdare.com-just recently as two days ago on vdare.com-spend so much time and effort worrying about how immigration harms Blacks is even more sickening. When push comes to shove, Blacks will always vote for the race-replacement of Native Born White Americans&hellip;this,is their intent&hellip;and it is a manifestly malignant intent towards Native Born White Americans. So to waste precious  time and resources making the case that Blacks are harmed by post-1965 legal immigration is complete nonesense. Peter Brimelow and vdare.com should not be doing this. Native Born White Americans and blacks need to go their separate ways.</p>

<p>&gt; Thanks for your post.  I LOVE Kipling!  Did anyone here see the PBS Masterpiece Theatre film about Kipling and his son&rsquo;s death in WW1 shown earlier this winter?  It was good EXCEPT that it made Kipling seem as if he was a MUSLIM!!  He was a Freemason and a British patriot.</p>
<p>Here is a poem I collected a few years ago, I think from some poster on Amren.  I had to write the last line here, because my copy seems to have been incomplete.  There was no by-line either.  Perhaps the original poster is still out there, and wouldn&rsquo;t mind posting it corrected?  Anyway, here it is;</p>
<p>England Forever</p>
<p>No crown but ours shall govern here, <br>
No strangers rule with gold or fear, <br>
No plow but ours may slough the loam, <br>
No prow but ours slash the spume, <br>
No hand but ours may bind our kin, <br>
No gods but ours proclaim a sin, <br>
No law but ours may stay a blow, <br>

Like this webite, such &#8216;good faith&rsquo; news articles are only allowed to exist as a safety valve.</p>
<p>For those who grimace at the truth they see, it is proof that someone still cares enough about honesty to say.</p>
<p>For those who -grin- rather then face the truth, it is a chance to see the arguments made so speciously that it&rsquo;s clear that they are not to be taken as a serious threat.</p>
<p>It is interesting to look at the psychologies of each.  Conservative critics look for communalism and agreement.  Liberatlist do gooders look for a reason to stand apart &#8216;as morally superior&rsquo; compared to those they despise being associated with as having common cause as much as &#8216;racist needs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the point you have to understand.  There is nothing wrong with being racist.  It is merely the dominance psychology by which one species group (lion prides, wolf packs, horse herds) exerts manipulative control over resources to another.  The twist lies in the certainty that until and unless you learn to acknowledge that need for dominant control _as a survival necessity_, you will never see the Darwinian selection process play out &#8216;as equals&rsquo; with competing genelines.</p>
<p>Just because we are all human does not mean we are all equally endowed to maintain a Modern, Western, culture.  But failing to admit that we want what our forefathers intended to be our inheritance more than blacks or mestizos or or or (liberal white leftists) means that we are subject to a destructive entropy effect whereby, _it is possible_ for all of us to lose.</p>
<p>This is the reality we must embrace: our social psychology (group altruism, for ourselves) will not act inclusively of all other population groups.  It just will not, instinctively, we will hold back from making a full effort to ensure the future of those we do not want to share our children&rsquo;s genes with.</p>
<p>And yet if we -don&rsquo;t- make that full effort, Western Culture will die anyway.  So it&rsquo;s them or us, regardless.</p>

		<p>College scholarships that do not apply to institutions with valuable (high standards driven) curriculum are a waste and nothing to be fought over.</p>
<p>We should use this (white education bias) as a justification to create our own, private, education system than then, like the Mormons and Amish, flood into select communities to dominate _through competence_ whas a sheepskin alone can no longer buy as a certification.</p>
<p>If Whites set up independent school systems in gated community style isolates, with collegiate level teleremoted courses that began very young and gave our superior intelligence a real lap-lead, we would quickly be able to completely dominate through private ownership what public sector controls now spoil as much as withhold from us.</p>
<p>Such -preparatory steps- being what we need to undertake, now, to ensure that we are ready for what comes after the fall.  Don&rsquo;t demand more money.  Don&rsquo;t demand more segregation by property tax isolation.  Get laws on the books which provide for the right of whites everywhere to educate their children as they see fit _without standards_ set by the public education system.  Then create the best home schooling system on the planet and remove the propaganda poison from our childrens&rsquo; learning experience.</p>

		<p>Three groups are always required in the progressive paradigm:</p>
<p>1) Bad lifestyle habits including immediate gratification and lack of personal responsibility are perpetually subsidized for one group. <br>
2) Responsibilities for the subsidy are shifted by theft onto the backs of a second (productive) group.<br>
3) A cut for the subsidy transfer is skimmed off by a third (elitist) group in order to entrench its wealth and power.</p>
<p>What is the end result? The end result is a kind of suicide cult: <br>
Group #2 is sucked dry and killed off, followed closely thereafter by the eradication of group #3 by group #1, after which group #1 self-eradicates because its members have neither the personal nor external resources to save themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody ever said that group #3 is not smart and cunning.  They very well might wake up in time to slightly modify the paradigm, so that group #2 is kept alive just enough to always supply the other two groups&hellip; in effect, slavery and/or a kind of living death for group #2. </p>
<p>We got this way because the left patiently and cynically preyed upon the natural sympathies and goodness of Judeo-Christian traditionalists, by distorting language to disguise its agenda. </p>

<p>The fact is that most crime is intra-racial and intra-class. Statistics demonstrate this. Most Blacks are likely to be the victim of crime by other Blacks 91% of the time. Most Whites are likely to be the victim of crime from other Whites 78% of the time.</p>
<p>If a wealthy person is murdered, statistics show that is a 60% percent chance that the person is also upscale or wealthy. For poor or lower income people, there is an 82% chance that this is the case.</p>
<p>Also, the odds that a man or woman is murdered by their spouse or someone who knows them is at least 50-70%   </p>

		<p>I, too, am getting sick and tired of self-proclaimed &#8220;race loyalists&#8221; fantasizing about whites and blacks allying against Hispanics and even Asians. I live in southern California, and Lord knows I&rsquo;m familiar with all the problems brown Hispanic immigrants, illegal AND legal, bring. But as bad as those Latinos are, the blacks are far worse. The Hispanic crime rate is three times the white crime rate, but the black crime rate is twice as high as Hispanics&rsquo; and six times as high as whites&rsquo;. The city of Compton, once a punchline for its ultra-high crime rate and sheer ghetto blackness, has seen a dramatic drop in crime (although it&rsquo;s still high) because Hispanics have pushed many of the blacks out. A Latino neighborhood will be dirty, unfamiliar, and full of non-English signs, but at least a white woman or man can walk down the street there without being jumped and curb-stomped because of the color of our skin. The same cannot be said for black neighborhoods. We are whites. We have achieved more than any other race, and we are fully capable of handling our brown mestizo problem without begging for the Bantu&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>Silly as the idea of a white/black alliance against Hispanics is, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the delusional fantasies some truly misguided self-proclaimed &#8220;race loyalists&#8221; have about a white/black alliance against Asians. If anything, we should be allying with the Asians against the blacks. Which race shares our values about hard work and education, and has a lower crime rate than whites? And which race reveres welfare, laziness, and Barack Obama, and has committed some of the most savage atrocities in history against our white children?</p>
<p>I believe as much as anyone here that America should be a white nation, and I have no problem with a ban on all non-white immigration, including Asians. But I have no beef with the Asians who are already citizens here, nor do I have a problem with white Hispanics. They have caused me no grief and I do not seek trouble where there is none. (Brown mestizos, of course, are another story, and they need to go back where they came from). But the blacks&hellip;they have given me and my kind more instances of grief than I can list here. For whites to ally with them is folly.</p>
<p>I have been called a &#8220;race traitor&#8221; for having Asian friends. Those of you who are calling for whites to ally with blacks&hellip;look in the mirror to see your race traitor.</p>

		<p>On the subject of racial alliances, I should add something about American Indians. I was reading some essays by David Yeagley, Comanche Indian and Amren speaker, and he made some good points. He was basically saying that liberals like George Soros want blacks and Indians to ally against whites. Neo-cons like Rush Limbaugh want whites and blacks to ally against Indians. But no one is talking about the alliance that makes the most sense - whites and Indians allied against blacks.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the facts. How did the Indian get to America? He walked over the Bering land bridge. He made it on his own. How did the white man get to America? He built ships and crossed the Atlantic Ocean. He made it on his own. Now how did the black man get to America? He never made it on his own. He had to hitch a free ride. Now which two races have something in common? Which two races should be allying against a common enemy?</p>
<p>Out of all the *outside* enemies (our white liberal race traitors are the worst enemies of all) we as white people face, blacks are the worst. Mestizos are bad. Muslims are bad - they killed 3000 of us on 9/11 - but blacks murder about 10,000 white people EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Since 9/11/01 almost 100,000 white Americans have been murdered by blacks. The WTC looks small in comparison. And that&rsquo;s just in America - add in the whites murdered by blacks in Canada, Europe, Australia, and especially South Africa, and let&rsquo;s face it - they&rsquo;re committing genocide against us.</p>

<p>&#8220;When one considers the statistics for test scores world-wide in which America falls way behind countries like Singapore, Sweden, or Switzerland, one needs to factor in the American black and latino population of students; Subtract the test scores of those minority populations, and the &ldquo;Americans&rsquo; scores compare very favorably with the highest in the world. This is the crux of the problem we have in the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a business capitalist myself I disagree with your opinion that &#8220;Americans&#8221; both with or without Hispanics and blacks subtracted would compare to the rest of the world. Currently, China, India, Japan, South Korea and Finland ( in the western hemisphere) have the highest standards of education and student performance. Even if I were to subtract the black and Latino quotient, the Euro-Americans would never compare even in the best private schools to the aforementioned nations in terms of the adavanced scientific, mathematical and general knowledge.<br>
Certain factors have become a disadvantage :</p>
<p>1. Our extremely dumbed down education standards incomparable to India and China.</p>
<p>2. The overall laziness and lack of motivation among the youth today ( yes I mean Euro Americans too). Instead of taking education and research seriously, the kids in America are more interested in wasting time in watching retarded garbage on TV, going to parties, facebook-chats, watching sports and indulging in activities that is bad for their morale. </p>

<p>Not true. There are plenty of Euro-American kids who are succeeding.</p>
<p>My 17-year old, for example, is taking AP Physics, the second course and  Calculus BC, which is the second course, at a public high school.  Both classes are filled with plenty of Whites and Asians, the physics textbook he uses the same one used at the UCs.</p>
<p>The standards for the AP English classes are excruciatingly high, a 5 (and only a 5) on the AP English Composition test allowed my daughter to move directly to second year English coursework at the UC she attends (UCs do not give credit for any APs, BTW, scores are only used for placement).</p>
<p>As for PISA scores, statistician Steve Sailer writes the following in his article: <i>Pisa Scores Show Demography is Destiny</i></p>
<p><i>White Americans students outperformed the national average in every one of the 37 historically white countries tested, except Finland (which is, perhaps not coincidentally, an immigration restrictionist nation where whites make up about 99 percent of the population).</i></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll notice on the chart:</p>
<p>Whites:</p>

<p>Asians:</p>

<p>And, for #49:</p>
<p><i>Please! America is still a White man&rsquo;s nation. Anyone who is being honest with themsleves knows this.</i></p>
<p>Are you naive, foolish or both?   What you state is beyond laughable and easily disproved.</p>
<p>May we have some examples of this being a &#8220;White Man&rsquo;s Nation&#8221; given that Whites are discriminated against via AA preferences for college admissions, job placements, by a media that refuse to report black-on-White torture/murders, for career advancement, for a hyper-hypocritical DOJ that does nothing when black thugs to intimidate White voters?</p>
<p>Let me ask you this:  Why does the USG allow every single racial/ethnic group to form advocacy groups that stand up for the &#8220;rights&#8221; of their people <b>except for Whites?</b>  Why are we called Racist Nazis when we try to form groups to defend and promote the interests our own people (Whites?) against outright government-enforced discrimination against us?</p>

I, too, am getting sick and tired of self-proclaimed &ldquo;race loyalists&rdquo; fantasizing about whites and blacks allying against Hispanics and even Asians. I live in southern California, and Lord knows I&rsquo;m familiar with all the problems brown Hispanic immigrants, illegal AND legal, bring. But as bad as those Latinos are, the blacks are far worse. The Hispanic crime rate is three times the white crime rate, but the black crime rate is twice as high as Hispanics&rsquo; and six times as high as whites&rsquo;. The city of Compton, once a punchline for its ultra-high crime rate and sheer ghetto blackness, has seen a dramatic drop in crime (although it&rsquo;s still high) because Hispanics have pushed many of the blacks out. A Latino neighborhood will be dirty, unfamiliar, and full of non-English signs, but at least a white woman or man can walk down the street there without being jumped and curb-stomped because of the color of our skin. The same cannot be said for black neighborhoods. We are whites. We have achieved more than any other race, and we are fully capable of handling our brown mestizo problem without begging for the Bantu&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>Silly as the idea of a white/black alliance against Hispanics is, it&rsquo;s nothing compared to the delusional fantasies some truly misguided self-proclaimed &ldquo;race loyalists&rdquo; have about a white/black alliance against Asians. If anything, we should be allying with the Asians against the blacks. Which race shares our values about hard work and education, and has a lower crime rate than whites? And which race reveres welfare, laziness, and Barack Obama, and has committed some of the most savage atrocities in history against our white children?</p>
<p>I believe as much as anyone here that America should be a white nation, and I have no problem with a ban on all non-white immigration, including Asians. But I have no beef with the Asians who are already citizens here, nor do I have a problem with white Hispanics. They have caused me no grief and I do not seek trouble where there is none. (Brown mestizos, of course, are another story, and they need to go back where they came from). But the blacks&hellip;they have given me and my kind more instances of grief than I can list here. For whites to ally with them is folly.</p>
<p>I have been called a &ldquo;race traitor&rdquo; for having Asian friends. Those of you who are calling for whites to ally with blacks&hellip;look in the mirror to see your race traitor.</p>
<p><br>
SNA viatrix:</p>
<p>Statistics demonstrate that Hispanics(espeically illegal immigrants) have the highest crime rate of any group. Have you seen the FBI&rsquo;s most wanted list?</p>
<p>Secondly, while there may be Blacks who are a menace to society, the fact is that (as Mr.Jared Taylor has stated several times), given the fact that Blacks did not migrate to America with their own free will. Thy have been here for centuries, in fact, much longer than most other groups of people and thus, do have a legitimate claim to American citzenship. Hispanics, Asians and other such groups cannot make such a claim. </p>
<p>This is simply a fact.</p>

<p>The fact is that most crime is intra-racial and intra-class. Statistics demonstrate this. Most Blacks are likely to be the victim of crime by other Blacks 91% of the time. Most Whites are likely to be the victim of crime from other Whites 78% of the time.</p>
<p>If a wealthy person is murdered, statistics show that is a 60% percent chance that the person is also upscale or wealthy. For poor or lower income people, there is an 82% chance that this is the case.</p>
<p>Also, the odds that a man or woman is murdered by their spouse or someone who knows them is at least 50-70% </p>
<p><br>
These figures sound reasonable.</p>

<p>I am much happier since I did this. I would never take a job where I had to work with, or even interact on an ongoing basis, with Minorities. I don&rsquo;t have too, and I just don&rsquo;t. </p>

		<p>To poster # 56, Bon - from the land of babble :</p>

<p>Asian nations consistently outscore western nations including USA in terms of the more accurate Science and Mathematical academic standards at school level :</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study</a></p>
<p>Also, even without any stats&hellip;..most high school toppers especially in the sciences and mathematics are Asian Americans comprising of Chinese, Indians, Japanese or Korean Americans. I seldom see south east Asians and Middle easterners near the top. Amongst the white ethnicities, Jewish Americans would flank the # 1 spot for their intellectual abilities.</p>
<p>Also, it is interesting to look at the statistics of yet another prominent western nation - a nation where the sun never set and the nation which ruled much of the world including the United States at one time - United Kingdom. As ususal, the Chinese / Indians outperform the native white Britons.</p>

<p>Yes, there certainly are highly talented and intelligent native born whites in America. But, commonsense dictates that they are far too few and in between. We are certainly on a downward trend. The most popular kids in society are not the nerds my friend, it is the braindead diva, bimbo, high school jock and the retards who give education a bad name. I must say, I am generally disappointed in the youth today. Meanwhile, the Chinese &amp; Indians are aggressively outscoring us in every field. China already has the world&rsquo;s fastest &amp; efficient supercomputer, fastest train&hellip;while India just released the world&rsquo;s fastest and longest range hypersonic cruise missile - BrahMos ( ranked #1 in the world) and had a successful lunar mission recently which enabled NASA to probe the presence of water on moon. There is a hugh tectonic shift of power from west to east and I&rsquo;m seeing it happen everyday - particularly with the callous behaviour of Euro Americans who like other groups such as blacks and Latinos live in a culture of entitlement and instant gratification rather than hard work &amp; enterprise.</p>

		<p>America may be somewhat still a white..woman&rsquo;s.. nation but it is in no sense a white man&rsquo;s any longer. White women(at least feminists)will have an out among the so-called minorities: they can always proclaim their own grievances against white men and will usually be listened to.</p>

		<p>&#8220;but blacks murder about 10,000 white people EVERY SINGLE YEAR&#8221;</p>
<p>This is false. According to the DOJ, between 1976 and 2005 the annual number of black on &#8220;white&#8221; homicides in the US ranged from 816 to 1,393. And this including many non-white hispanic victims.</p>

		<p>Mark, what you are saying is simply not true. Crime statistics from every source - FBI/DOJ, local law enforcement, private statisticians, etc. - show that the black crime rate is approximately twice as high as the Hispanic crime rate. As for the FBI&rsquo;s Top Ten list, ten arbitrarily selected criminals are hardly a representative sample of anything. Also remember that the black Obama administration is in charge of the government, including the FBI, and they certainly have a motive for keeping blacks off the Top Ten list - and focusing white anger on other targets.</p>
<p>On the Asian issue, Asians can assimilate to American culture within a generation through their own intelligence and hard work, while blacks whose families have been here for hundreds of years still isolate themselves in ghettos, speak ebonics, and scream kill whitey. Who is that a black (no pun intended) mark against? How are you going to explain blacks&rsquo; utter failure to be successful when they&rsquo;ve been here for so long and have had all sorts of benefits and opportunities handed to them on a platter? What are you going to do, blame evil racist whitey for oppressing the poor black man? Please try it, it&rsquo;ll expose you as the troll I suspect you are.</p>
<p>As for Hispanics, &#8220;Hispanic&#8221; is not a race. There are white Hispanics, brown Hispanics, and black Hispanics. Brown and black Hispanics are troublemakers and should be dealt with accordingly. White Hispanics are our white brothers and sisters. If you automatically take the black&rsquo;s side in any black vs. Hispanic conflict, you may well be siding with a non-white against a white. Is that your definition of &#8220;racial loyalty&#8221;?</p>
<p>I have never said that blacks should be deported or stripped of their citizenship. I simply advocate the repeal of the unconstitutional 1964 Snivel Rights Act, the overturning of the evil (yes, it was evil) Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, and a return to legal, voluntary segregation and freedom of association. On that particular issue Mr. Jared Taylor (since you so kindly brought his name into the discussion) and myself are in full agreement. </p>
<p>As for Asians and White Hispanics, if they&rsquo;re here illegally or they&rsquo;re anchor babies, they do not deserve to be in America, but if they are true citizens (U.S. citizens who are not anchor babies), I do not see why the already overpowered federal government should have the power to revoke their citizenship and throw them out, especially if English is the only language they speak. The Obama administration certainly does not need yet another power. That is my opinion and I speak for myself alone, not Jared Taylor or anyone else. You shouldn&rsquo;t try to speak for Jared Taylor either.</p>
<p>And why should &#8220;how long someone&rsquo;s been here&#8221; be the end-all standard for deciding who should be a citizen? Do you think a black person whose ancestors have been here since 1700 is &#8220;more&#8221; of a citizen than a white person whose ancestors didn&rsquo;t come here until 1900?</p>

		<p>John (47): Perhaps you cannot see the flaws in your own argument. You point out, correctly, that the beliefs of whichever guy you were arguing with are not the same thing as &#8220;the truth.&#8221; But then you praise Mr. Engleman as some sort of noble beacon of shining light. Mr. Engleman&rsquo;s statements are his own personal opinions and are not the same thing as &#8220;the truth&#8221; either. The same can be said of your beliefs, my beliefs, and the beliefs of everyone else, everywhere. We ALL have our own personal biases. It&rsquo;s part of human nature. To pretend that ANYONE is completely above that is ridiculous. </p>
<p>And on the subject of shark jumpers, I suspect that most of those who make extremely foolish posts here are either leftist trolls trying to make us look bad, or white supremacist/neo-Nazi types who have ruined the reputations of their own websites through their own stupid antics and are now trying to come here because Amren is &#8220;clean.&#8221; Kind of like the blacks who ruin their own neighborhoods and then try to move into white ones.</p>
<p>Some people treat the Internet as a giant popularity contest. They make posts slavishly praising other people and seek the same kind of praise in return. I have no need for that and frankly, I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t have &#8220;groupies.&#8221; My freedom of speech is all I need and I&rsquo;ll be happy. I&rsquo;ll speak my piece and some will agree and some will disagree. That&rsquo;s the way the world is and I have no beef with that. </p>
<p>The Internet is too damn important to turn into a popularity contest, especially when the survival of the White race is at stake.</p>

<p>Good for the Asians.  Tell them to stay in their own countries and stop flooding into ours.  And, while you&rsquo;re at it, tell them to stop stealing our technology as well.</p>
<p>We could quibble all day on this board as to which race has done what and it would get us nowhere, and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter to me either way.</p>
<p>What matters is this:  This is a concerted effort to &#8220;genocide&#8221; us Whites worldwide and destroy our homelands so there will be nowhere to run.</p>
<p><b>Nothing Else Matters.</b></p>
<p>Maybe if the USG would take its boot off our necks and stop telling our children in the government schools that we are responsible for all evil and poverty in the world *ALL OF IT*  and that we should hand over our wealth to solve it, we would be doing better.</p>
<p>Maybe if the USG would stop outright discriminating against us via AA, favoring those with IQs of 85 over us, we would do better.</p>
<p>Maybe if the USG would stop flooding our homeland and schools with &#8220;immigrants&#8221; and refugees from the poorest, most backwards places in  Africa, Asia and the Middle East and stop demanding that we pay for them via satanic taxation we would do better.  Maybe if the USG would stop the H-1B program that favors sub-par Indian and Asian engineers and programmers over Native Born White Americans we would be doing better.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think our children don&rsquo;t know this because they do, especially when our high-scoring White children are locked out of college slots in favor of those with drastically lesser abilities and forced to honor foreign cultures instead of their own (which they&rsquo;re told is pathological).</p>
<p>Maybe if the USG allowed our people to have White-rights groups, as is afforded every other racial/ethnic group in the US, we could speak up and out against White discrimination and black predators that rob, rape, torture and murder our people with neigh impunity while the media and government yawn (or cheer our demise).</p>
<p>We are in a death spiral because of triangulated programs that have been put in place 50 years ago to eliminate us, before the advent of the Internet, with the full complicity of the government, academia, and intelligentsia.</p>
<p>Our homelands flooded with non-Whites.  Our culture dismantled.  Our achievements assigned to others.  Murder and mayhem against Whites with nary a peep from the media.  A concerted effort to decrease White numbers world-wide. Government edict not to organize ourselves.</p>
<p>If this is not genocide I don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<p>Are Whites racially oppressed? </p>
<p>Oppression?  </p>
<p>We are targeted for genocide.</p>
