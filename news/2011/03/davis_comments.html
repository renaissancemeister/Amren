<h1>Davis&rsquo; Comments Shock GOP Leaders</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jerry Zremski, Buffalo News, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Congressional candidate Jack Davis shocked local Republican leaders in a recent interview when he suggested that Latino farmworkers be deported  &mdash;  and that African-Americans from the inner city be bused to farm country to pick the crops.</p>
<p>Several sources who were in the Feb. 20 endorsement interview with Davis confirmed his comments, which echo those he made to the Tonawanda News in 2008, when he said: &#8220;We have a huge unemployment problem with black youth in our cities. Put them on buses, take them out there [to the farms] and pay them a decent wage; they will work.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Davis repeated those sentiments in the recent interview, the Republican leaders  &mdash;  who later delivered the party endorsement for the vacant seat in the 26th Congressional District to Assemblywoman Jane L. Corwin of Clarence  &mdash;  said they couldn&rsquo;t believe what they were hearing.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Davis spokesman W. Curtis Ellis acknowledged that Davis&rsquo; comments &#8220;may not be politically correct and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may not be racially correct.&#8221;</p>
<p>The revelations about Davis highlighted a busy Monday in the race to replace Rep. Chris Lee, an Amherst Republican who resigned last month after getting caught in an Internet flirtation with a woman who wasn&rsquo;t his wife.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Through his campaigns, Davis has struck a populist bent, raging against the impact free trade has had on local manufacturing and the effect illegal immigration has had on the country. Sources said he repeated those sentiments in the February meeting with GOP leaders.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not be politically correct and it may not be racially correct, but when you have African American people in Buffalo who do not have jobs and are out of work, why are you bringing people into this country illegally to take jobs?&#8221; Ellis asked.</p>

I can&rsquo;t believe it either.  After all, they won&rsquo;t work when they can collect welfare and commit crimes instead.</p>

How dare he suggest that lazy unemployed blacks actually be given work. And enforce our immigration laws?  WTH is he thinking.  Have him make an official apology and run him out of office asap.</p>

<p>The reason why those unemployed blacks live in the cities (some the most expensive places to live in the world) is in order to prevent whites from living there.  They only survive on 100% handouts.</p>
<p>If we are going to change to an employment model for blacks, why should they be &#8220;bussed in&#8221;.  It would be cheaper and far easier to live where they work.</p>
<p>Of course, all this would already be happening if anti-white racism wasn&rsquo;t what defined policy in the US.</p>

		<p>We have black atheletes who receive fifty million dollar deals and still have their enablers who speak righteously about how they are slaves on an auctioning block. Does anyone believe that if blacks are asked to work in a field, even for a decent wage, that they will just go with the flow?</p>
<p>And while blacks themselves would probably overwhelmingly approve of his deportation initiative, this Davis character is forgetting that in our representative government the black politicians are as eager as their white counterparts to sell out their own people to garner a piece of that Hispanic vote.  </p>

		<p>Mr. Davis&rsquo; proposal is more ethical than the current welfare system, as there is dignity in work. It would also solve a good portion of our national obesity problem which would, surely, make Michelle Obama very happy.</p>

I was trying to come up with alternative headlines like, &#8220;A Reasonable Proposal&#8221;, &#8220;Work American Blacks Won&rsquo;t Do&#8221;, or &#8220;Honest Work Demeaning to African Americans&#8221;.</p>
<p>Blacks in Buffalo are incessantly telling us that the crime problem in Buffalo is caused by black unemployment. Whenever a violent crime is committed by blacks, neighbors who are interviewed say black boys need jobs. Black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; also tell us that jobs for blacks is THE KEY to solving the black crime problem.</p>
<p>Now someone offers a reasonable solution to two problems and everyone is shocked.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for black &#8216;leaders&rsquo; in Buffalo to support this imitative. They won&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t want to demean blacks by actually expecting them to get their hands dirty by doing &#8216;Hispanic labor&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In other news, two weeks ago, there were two stabbings at a rap concert half a block from a police station. Just this morning, there was a fatal shooting directly across the street from the metro police station. Shootings and crime in the vicinity of police stations is nothing new in Buffalo. It happened before and it will again.</p>

I still will not forgive them for being weak and allowing an Obamination take root.</p>

Hard core right (like Jack Davis), Tea Partier, liberal Democrat; then the &#8220;moderate&#8221;, &#8220;center&#8221;, &#8220;cross appeal&#8221; (Jeb Bush types). <br>

		<p>Blacks would be useless in the fields. They would do less than half the work that hispanics do, and they would probably kill a few of each other.The only solution for the efficient harvesting of crops would be a guest worker program.</p>

		<p>I wish we could clone this guy for every congressional race!  If Republicans really want to win, they have to make a case that they will protect and promote the jobs and wages of native-born Americans.  Deportation of illegals, a basic moratorium on legal immigration, and a better trade policy are key building blocks to make that case.  Of course, it is not clear that the GOP establishment really wants to win.</p>

		<p>I remember in the seventies when social freebies became widely available. Black workers disappeared over two years and migrant Mexicans replaced them on the farm I worked summers as a teen. Davis pointed out a sure bet. Of course, eliminate the misery and the socialist house can&rsquo;t win. Or really has no reason to otherwise exist. Thus, suggesting people work is &#8220;racist&#8221;. </p>

		<p> I nominate Jack Davis for the Prince Philip Award. If there was one, it would given each year to the man who says what everybody else was thinking, but was afraid to say.</p>
<p> Actually, his suggestion about busing blacks from the inner city to the rural areas to pick crops   &mdash;   after the Hispanics had been deported   &mdash;   makes sense in a way. In many cases, it&rsquo;s not that blacks &#8220;can&rsquo;t find&#8221; jobs; it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re gaming a system which seems to have been designed to pay people to be poor. And to be fair, there are many Whites, and other races, who are gaming it, too.</p>
<p> But blacks make up the critical mass of that group. I say, Bus &#8216;em out there. The fresh air and exercise will do them good. Let them see what it&rsquo;s like to earn a day&rsquo;s pay, instead of just having it handed to you.<br>

		<p>No one here should be in favor of bringing back chattel slavery. Davis is an idiot. Native Born White American Patriots are better than this.  Instead of calling for a return to chattel slavery-and this is exactly where this is going-he could have openly opposed a race-replacing post-1965 legal immigration policy.</p>

		<p>Former first lady Patricia Nixon worked picking fruit during the summers while in high school and college.</p>
<p>Only 40 years ago the fruit ranchers in Oregon and Washington employed local White high school students to harvest the crops.  They sent buses to all the small towns.  Many kids bought their first cars with money earned picking crops.</p>
<p>But all those teen age jobs such as paper routes, yard work, maid and baby sitting, restaurant etc have been given to illegal immigrant adults rather than the teens who held those jobs for hundred of years.</p>

		<p>Assuming this were logistically feasible what&rsquo;s wrong with the idea for inner-city kids regardless of color?</p>
<p>My wife was in nursing school in the Ukraine towards the end of the Soviet Union era.  </p>
<p>The girls at her nursing school (along with other groups)were given a one month break and bused to gov owned grape vineyards to pick grapes.  They were given 3 hots and cabins to stay in and while the work wasn&rsquo;t easy she has fond memories of those days.</p>
<p>Of course getting inner-city kids to successfully engage in actual physical work out-doors might present it&rsquo;s own challenges.</p>

		<p>What a laugh. Has this Jack Davis ever actually laid eyes on or interacted with unemployed inner-city blacks? Most are not motivated to work at all, keep regular hours or commute to jobs they don&rsquo;t want in the first place. They drink too much, smoke and do drugs; they aren&rsquo;t physically capable of doing this sort of stoop labor for more that a day or two, and that includes the impressive looking musclehead ex-cons amongst them. Bright ideas like this always fall flat in the real world. Davis seems to think he&rsquo;s the only one who has ever thought up a scheme like this when in fact similar things have been tried (minus the deportations, of course) over and over </p>

		<p>No,NO,No!!! That Davis guy has it all wrong. I think the plan is for white people to pick crops as a side job so all of us whites from the privileged race can earn enough money to pay for all the goodies and programs blacks and Hispanics so desperately want and deserve. </p>

		<p>Are the naysayers upset because Mr. Davis wants to employ Americans? I like the idea, although I didn&rsquo;t realize that we grew any produce anymore. Everything I see in the markets have stickers on them telling me the tomato or the avacado or whatever comes from Mexico, Central or South America&hellip;so why do we even need illegals? Oh, I forgot, we Americans are so stupid, we need them to be CEOs.</p>

		<p>Here in Connecticut back in the 1950s and 1960s, a popular summer job was picking and sewing tobacco. (White) kids would be bussed up to farms in Northern Connecticut and work 8-hour days for minimum wage. I suppose now to have blacks do the same work (without it being called racist), you&rsquo;d have to pay them all $100-an-hour and provide them with Cadillac Escalades. </p>

		<p>What in the world is so wrong about his position? The Hispanics are here illegally, so they should be deported. That&rsquo;s self-explanatory.</p>
<p>The inner-city blacks are unemployed, impoverished, and (small wonder) are committing crimes. If they were making a good wage doing farm work, how would that not be a benefit to them? Whites have had a noble tradition of doing agricultural labour throughout their history. Why are people so scared of giving blacks the option to do a little honest labour? And being outdoors would undoubtedly be healthier for them than their urban lifestyles, healthier in every sense.</p>
<p>Again, note that he said &#8220;pay them a decent wage.&#8221; This is a completely sensible and compassionate proposal.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought that the massive amount of unskilled and seasonal work done by illegals could easily be done by other groups of americans who don&rsquo;t work. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if it were innner city youth, the homeless, or common welfare trash. Who cares what they are or are not payed for their services. Learning a work ethic and having a reference for a real job is worth infinitely more than a lifetime of crackbabies and low income housing projects. Of course this is counterproductive to the welfare state. To suggest anything such as this is immediately considered &#8220;shocking&#8221;. </p>

		<p>OK, I admire this guy&rsquo;s courage, but if he&rsquo;s talking about transplanting blacks to my largely white rural midwest, this is NOT a good idea. I WILL fight him tooth and nail.</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s unlikely to happen. Try to imagine blacks working as hard as Hispanics. Yeah, it&rsquo;s almost surreal. Also, there would be too many parallels to &#8220;slave days&#8221; for most blacks. </p>

I think it is a good idea and I also think by saying that, that he killed his political career.Things ARE gonna change though, but when &#8220;urban&#8221; blacks begin leaving the urban areas of the big cities, it WILL NOT be to work on any farm for any amount of money, they will be leaving to loot, rob, rape (especially White women) pillage, murder&hellip;.you know&hellip;the usual by the usual suspects. Repeated scenes of &#8220;In Cold Blood&#8221; is what is gonna be happening, especially to unarmed White Americans.</p>

		<p>To find a solution for replacing the Mexican migrant workers who currently harvest our crops we need only look back to a program used throughout the South in the early 20th century. The solution is for local prisons to lease out low wage chain gangs to farmers who need assistance harvesting their crops. Not only would this solve the migrant problem, it would serve as a strong deterrent for committing crime, and it would provide local governments with much needed revenue. </p>

		<p>Perhaps whites in America need to model their communities like Orania, South Africa.  In that town, whites must do all their own work - manual labor included - and it is illegal to hire a black person to do work for them.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it is, white civilization will not thrive until whites dig their own ditches, clean their own toilets, and care for their own sick and elderly.</p>

		<p>Best idea I have heard in ages. Here in Chicago, they are always claiming that a lack of jobs for teens is causing them to turn to crime. Lets bus them out to the field where they will stay until the crop is picked. They will get good exercise, fresh air, and kept away from gang leaders. They won&rsquo;t get paid until the crop has been harvested.<br>
   They do not have to do this. If they refuse, mama loses her welfare check.<br>
   Getting the illegals out will be an added benefit.</p>

		<p>Some of these comments are really shocking. Agricultural work could have been easily mechanized years ago and  no one would  had to do what everyone here  understands is chattel slavery. Moreover, no one here is suggesting that very wealthy people-Lou Dobbs and his two teenage daughters for example-be coerced into picking crops. Why is this? Why aren&rsquo;t there calls for coercing the wealthy into farm labor? How does one morally justify coercing the poor into-whatever the race- farmwork while the wealthy-the very ones who have forced an race-replacement immigration policy upon millions of ordinary Native Born White Americans get to enjoy the fruits of their great stolen wealth. </p>

		<p>Give Mr. Davis credit for having the guts to tell it like it is. However this simplistic idea won&rsquo;t work in the real world. As others have noted being bussed to farm work was a summer staple for White teens decades ago.Honest hard work provided much needed income for typical teen needs. Changing times made for lazy enabled teens who couldn&rsquo;t get off their skateboard or put down their video game to work. Blacks were already ingrained with an entitled mentality so hispanics filled the void. Yes we need to crack down hard on illegals but the void will never be filled by lazy black thugs unless they are on a prison work detail. Kudos to Mr. Davis for defying PC, but we don&rsquo;t live in a simple world.</p>

		<p>Anyone who denies that low-wage-very low wage farm work-is not chattel slavery, they should go have a look at the documentaries &#8220;Bitter Harvest&#8221; and &#8220;Bitter Harvest Two&#8221;.</p>
<p>The reason why farm labor was never fully mechanized is because of the opposition of Cesar Chavez. The full mechanization of American agriculture is long overdue. If it had been done earlier, the only remaining farm labor would be skilled robotics repair and operation technicians who would be highly paid.</p>
<p>Keep something in mind, Slaves are defined by the options available to the slave. People without any leverage and power are the ones that always fall into slavery. And when this happens a culture emerges which justifies this as being the natural order of things. But there is nothing natural about this. Its all about who has the power.</p>
<p>As a previously mentioned, Davis could have openly opposed nonwhite legal immigration because its continuation will reduce Nataive Born White Americans to an ever dwindling racial minority within the borders of America..with no power or leverage, the very condition that increases the risk of chattel enslavement. Be very carefull what you wish for folks.</p>

		<p>Do you know what bothers ME the most?  The many, many people who have posted ACCEPTING the theme that &#8220;blacks won&rsquo;t work&#8221; and thereby ACCEPT that we should keep on paying them to sit on their stoops, deal their drugs, have open free time to rape our daughters, etc.  What bothers me even more than that, are the few who seem to think farm labor is &#8220;chattel labor&#8221;.  Obviously, those sort are DWAR (Disingenious White Am Renners).  Chattel labor is slave labor, no payment tendered for work forced on them, and chattel is another name for PROPERTY.  Since when did farm labor, one of the industries which made our nation the grocery store to the world, become so repulsive?  WHY is it so repulsive to expect anybody (other than Mexicans) to work in the fields.  As has been stated, many white teens were happy to do so.  My own step son did so.  So why should blacks be exempt?  It is NOT an outrageous idea to require those on welfare to WORK at SOMETHING in order to be eligible for partial aid through welfare.  We used to have vagrancy laws.  We need them back.  We used to have prisoners working on various road and farming jobs.  We need to get back to that.  We used to have blacks working at SOMETHING and many happy to do so, before we copped out and established an entire lifestyle allowing them to do nothing at all, and hate us for doing so while expecting even more from us.  Kick the illegals out.  Make agri-corps pay decent wages and prosecute them heavily if they break laws by hiring illegals.  Make Welfare recipients work as part of the deal at SOMETHING, and if they can&rsquo;t find something, WE will find something for them to do like picking crops, pounding gravel into roadbeds, cleaning the streets, whatever.  WHY do so many here just ACCEPT that we should continue to pay blacks to do nothing, and when an alternative is offered, then whine about how that can&rsquo;t be done.  SURE IT CAN.  And it SHOULD be.  We are going broke and losing our souls as a nation pandering to illegal aliens and the black alien amongst us, while assuming some  sorts of work has no dignity attached to it.  I was a janitor for four years during college.  So what?  I was happy for the income.  Was it demeaning?  NO.  It was work that needed to be done, so I tried to do it well.   To those who seem to keep saying &#8220;well, blacks won&rsquo;t work so why even try to make them&#8221;  I say, then stop whining about blacks not working when YOU have accepted and enabled them not working with your defeatist attitude.  </p>

		<p>Black people and yes even white people used to do farm work. I know because as a teenager I was one of those people. So what happened?</p>
<p>Most small family owned farms went bankrupt or were sold off because it was no longer possible to make a living as an independent farmer. Now farms are large corporate affairs that need lots of cheap, government subsidized labor. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that even Hitler realized that a rural peasant class was important for the stability of a nation. </p>
<p>The Roman Empire eliminated their small farms and replaced them with large estates worked by slaves and we did the same thing with illegal immigrants. </p>
<p>This leads me to believe that Hitler may have read a history book about what happened to the Roman Empire. </p>

Not only would this solve the migrant problem, it would serve as a strong deterrent for committing crime, and it would provide local governments with much needed revenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>This could be a solution, but it would have to be monitored closely.  The problem in the old days was that it corrupted quickly into cheap labor schemes with payoffs to local politicians, special favors, etc.  On top of that, and worst of all is that crimes were invented when the chain gang populations got too low.  Add to all this the problem that veritable sadists often made up the ranks of guards.  </p>
<p>The corruption of that system was made famous by a number of historical situations and reforms were begun.  I agree with anyone who would say that we have gone too far int he opposite direction today.  But if you don&rsquo;t want to research and read up on it, I can suggest a few old movies made in the 1930s, &rsquo;40s, even early &rsquo;50s on the subject.  Aside from &#8220;Cool Hand Luke, and Papillion,&#8221; which is more a showcase for Paul Newman and Steve McQueen, we have a number of other more pertinent films, the most important being, &#8220;I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang,&#8221; 1932, Paul Muni. This is an absolutely true story.  The actual fugitive was present at the studio for a time, helping direct the film as it was being made, which was based on his book.  He had to flee the set at a point.  </p>
<p>Many of you will no doubt know about this film and the story, so I am just reminding all of us that as we make suggestions and nurture our zeal for a correction to the current set of injustices being dealt to white Americans through systematic usurpation, that we do not revert to the harsh and heart-breaking corruption of the times some now refer to as somehow being, &#8220;The Good Old Days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since we are focusing so much on Japanese culture and conduct these days, perhaps it is valid to view how they deal with crime and confinement, &#8220;How would the Japanese do it?&#8221;  I looked it up and found among other things the following;</p>
<p>Copied from Wikipedia;</p>
<p>On confinement, prisoners are first classified according to gender, nationality, type of penalty, length of sentence, degree of criminality, and state of physical and mental health. They are then placed in special programs designed to treat their individual needs.</p>
<p>Vocational and formal education are emphasized, as is instruction in social values. Most convicts engage in labor, for which a small stipend is set aside for use on release. Under a system stressing incentives, prisoners are initially assigned to community cells, then earn better quarters and additional privileges based on their good behavior.<br>
[edit] Administration</p>
<p>The Correctional Bureau of the Ministry of Justice administers the adult prison system as well as the juvenile correctional system and three women&rsquo;s guidance homes (to rehabilitate prostitutes). The ministry&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and parole systems. Prison personnel are trained at an institute in Tokyo and in branch training institutes in each of the eight regional correctional headquarters under the Correctional Bureau. Professional probation officers study at the Legal Training and Research Institute of the Ministry.<br>
[edit] Prison population</p>
<p>In 1990 Japan&rsquo;s prison population stood at somewhat less than 47,000; nearly 7,000 were in short-term detention centers, and the remaining 40,000 were in prisons. Approximately 46 percent were repeat offenders. Japanese recidivism was attributed mainly to the discretionary powers of police, prosecutors, and courts and to the tendency to seek alternative sentences for first offenders. By 2001 The overall prison population rose to 61,242[1] or 48 prisoners per 100,000. By of the end of 2009, the prison population had yet again risen to 75,250, or 59 prisoners per 100,000.[2] One reason for the rise is a large increase in the number of elderly being convicted of crimes, with loneliness being cited as a major factor.[3][4]<br>
[edit] Juvenile offenders</p>
<p>Although a few juvenile offenders are handled under the general penal system, most are treated in separate juvenile training schools. More lenient than the penal institutions, these facilities provide correctional education and regular schooling for delinquents under the age of twenty.<br>
[edit] Aftercare treatment</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Justice, the government&rsquo;s responsibility for social order does not end with imprisoning an offender, but also extends to aftercare treatment and to noninstitutional treatment to substitute for or supplement prison terms.</p>
<p>A large number of those given suspended sentences are released to the supervision of volunteer officers under the guidance of professional probation officers. Adults are usually placed on probation for a fixed period, and juveniles are placed on probation until they reach the age of twenty.<br>
[edit] Use of volunteers</p>
<p>Volunteers are also used in supervising parolees, although professional probation officers generally supervise offenders considered to have a high risk of recidivism. Volunteers hail from all walks of life and handle no more than five cases at one time. They are responsible for overseeing the offenders&rsquo; conduct to prevent the occurrence of further offenses. Volunteer probation officers also offer guidance and assistance to the ex-convict in assuming a law-abiding place in the community.</p>
<p>Although volunteers are sometimes criticized for being too old compared with their charges (more than 70 percent are retired and are age fifty-five or over) and thus unable to understand the problems their charges faced, most authorities believe that the volunteers are critically important in the nation&rsquo;s criminal justice system.<br>
[edit] Inmate rights abuses</p>
<p>Amnesty International has cited Japan for abuse of inmates by guards for infractions of prison rules. This abuse is in the form of beatings, solitary confinement, overcrowding, or &#8220;Minor solitary confinement&#8221; (keiheikin), which forces inmates to be interned in tiny cells kneeling or crossed legged, and restrained with handcuffs for prolonged periods of time. [1],&#8221;</p>
<p>Searching the agricultural system in Japa was interesting as well.  I suspect that the Japanese have been consciously having less children so that the Japanese can better manage their islands in the future.  It is clear that an ever expanding population will require more and more outside support.  It appears that the Japanese are number one in the application of both foresight and common sense.<br>

<p>No one volunteers to do farmwork. They &#8220;volunteer&#8221;. I did farm work for a  month one summer when I was in college. When I made my first complaint about the low wages I was told:&#8221;If you don&rsquo;t like it I can get the Puerto Ricans&#8221; My late father was already into his sixth month of being unemployed at the time after the legal asian immigrants stole his engineering job..along with thousands of other Native Born White American Men who had their engineering jobs stolen by legal asian immigrants. I actually considered enlisting at the time. If this isn&rsquo;t a chattel slaves choice..it&rsquo;s darn close to one.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll ask the question again:Will Lou Dobbs and his teenage daughters-who attend Yale-be coerced into doing farm work? How about that other well known immigration enthusiast from Dale NJ Bruce Springteen. Will his spoiled Boston College son be coerced into doing backbreaking farmwork? How about Jorge Bush and daughters? Yeah, we all know the obvious answers to these questions. Farmwork is for some people and not for others. Real fair isn&rsquo;t. If Native Born White American Patriots don&rsquo;t come up with plans for reconstructing White American society that has economic fairness at its core, they may very well keep the race-replacement game going on for a long time.</p>
<p>Thousands of Native Born White American Teenagers enlist in the US Military when faced with the &#8220;choice&#8221; of very low wage back backbreaking work such as farm labor. Thousands of them come back in body bags or to Walter Reed Army Hospital missing libs. </p>
