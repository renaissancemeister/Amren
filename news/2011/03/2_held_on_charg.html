<h1>2 Held on Charges of Sexually Assaulting 11-Year-Old Girl at Sleepover</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lolly Bowean and Deanese Williams-Harris, Chicago Tribune, March 3, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Bail was set today for two men accused of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl while she was attending a sleepover party for one of the suspects&rsquo; younger sister.</p>
<p>Steven Johnson, 19, of the 17800 block of Chicago Avenue in Lansing, and Daniel Rucker, 20, of Calumet City, are both charged with predatory criminal sexual assault, a Class X felony.</p>
<p>The girl was visiting Johnson&rsquo;s home on Feb. 26 because his sister was having a sleepover to celebrate her 12th birthday, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Sometime that night, the girl went to the basement for some blankets and was assaulted by both Johnson and his friend Rucker, Assistant Cook County State&rsquo;s Atty. Allison Sise said in court.</p>
<p>The party started Saturday evening and included dancing and games that continued into the late evening, police said. When the girls went upstairs for bed, the 11-year-old was sent by an adult to the basement, police said.</p>
<p>After the court hearing, Tom Driscoll, a deputy supervisor with the state&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;s office, said an adult took the girl home at 9:45 a.m. the next day even though she told the adult and a friend of the attack that night.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>An investigation found evidence on a mattress in the home, Sise said. The girl identified both Johnson and Rucker in a line-up.</p>
<p>Rucker admitted to having sex with the girl, Sise told the judge. Johnson told police he had sexual contact with the girl.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Children as well as other adult family members of Johnson were in the house at the time of the attack, police said. Police said they were seeking their cooperation in the investigation, and that the Department of Children and Family Services has been notified.</p>
<p>Johnson and Rucker are friends who work together at an advertising company, lawyers said.</p>

		<p>Johnson lives with his mother and his 2-year old child in Lansing. He is on probation for a theft charge. As a juvenile, Rucker pleaded guilty to aggravated battery and also has a child who lives with the child&rsquo;s mother.<br>

Why do they keep letting them out? Why do they keep giving them another chance? <br>

These young black rapists will be hung in prison by their own cell inmates or add to a prison system grossly saturated with rapists.</p>

		<p>The story of the 11-year-old&rsquo;s rape made it to the press, suggesting that the victim was not White.</p>
<p>But then, the &#8220;adults&#8221; in the house chose her for the important task of retrieving blankets from the basement, suggesting that they wanted the job done right&hellip;</p>

<p>Ah, yes, they look right out of the cast of &#8216;Mad Men.&rsquo;  That is why Steven Johnson, 19, lives at home, right?</p>
<p>I would place money that what these two *actually* do for a living is hand out flyers for nightclubs and place them on windshields.  That allows them to roll out of bed past noon and stroll into work only when they run out of &#8220;blunt&#8221; money.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope they get stiff sentences; additionally the parents should be charged with neglect of a child for not getting the rape victim to a hospital immediately after she informed them.  Lock them all away.</p>

		<p>This very thing is one reason my mother rarely allowed me to attend slumber parties. Often there isn&rsquo;t much adult supervision and if adult males are present there is an assault risk. This girl should have never been sent into the basement alone  &mdash;   especially with high testosterone and low impulse control black males present. I am pretty sure that all parties involved are black but based on reporting it would be hard to tell. If the girl and parents are white then hopefully their eyes are opened to the feral nature of most black men. Unfortunately political correctness would make many parents give permission for a preteen girl to attend such a party against better judgement. I was also not allowed to go to overnights if both parents were not present or if it was held in a bad neighborhood.</p>

		<p>Blacks dont appreciate whites, assuming the girl was black, getting into their business and besides these 2 are immediately excused as only being human and forgiven.</p>

		<p>I keep reading about how plastics and soy products have negatively changed the testosterone level of American Males. Why is it that Black males aren&rsquo;t equally affected? They eat plenty of junky food of which soy is an integral ingredient and they drink cheap wine and booze from plastic bottles. Why aren&rsquo;t they being feminized?</p>

		<p>Probably, like others here, I assumed the girl is White for the following reasons.</p>
<p>1. In a crime, no mention of race of perp = Perp is black!<br>
2. In a rape with no mention of race of victim = Victim is White<br>
3. Blacks don&rsquo;t have to rape 11 year old black girls<br>
4. Blacks would not have sent a black girl to the basement<br>
5. Only a White girl would be so naive to GO to the basement.</p>
