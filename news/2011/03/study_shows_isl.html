<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Troubles from &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221;? Not in the United States, according to a new study today that says attacks on Muslims do not happen a great deal more than attacks on Christians. {snip}</p>
<p>The results come from the Center for Security Policy, which produced a 42-page report called &#8220;Religious Bias Crimes 2000-2009: Muslim, Jewish and Christian Victims  &mdash;  Debunking the Myth of a Growing Trend of Muslim Victimization.&#8221; </p>
<p>The evaluation used statistics on reported crimes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation&rsquo;s Uniform Crime Reporting Program. </p>
<p>The study contradicts claims that religious bias crimes against Muslims have increased because of the spread of so-called &#8220;Islamophobia.&#8221; The report said &#8220;religious bias crimes  &mdash;  also known as hate crimes  &mdash;  against Muslim Americans, measured by categories of incidents, offenses or victims, have remained relatively low with a downward trend since 2001, and are significantly less than the numbers of bias crimes against Jewish victims.&#8221; </p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>Two types of Moslems reside in the Twin Cities. Those from the Middle East are mostly college educated and lead assimilated middle class lives. Those from Africa, particulary Somalia, are uneducated, unassimilated, dependent on welfare, and prone to black on white crime. The problem is not religion, it is race.</p>

<p>Muslims MURDERED nearly 3000 Americans in ONE DAY and thousands more through the world but THEY claim they are the victims in America.<br>

<p>Eva! this is probably the case at the moment because blacks are inherently violent and opportunistic. BUT! please believe this, when there are enough muslims and the muslims feel they have the clout to defy the law and government in their determination to convert America to islamic sharia THEY WILL! this bodes very badly for American women and already terrifies women in muslim countries (been working in muslim countries for nearly 8 years and speak conversational Arabic)) I know what they think, I know what they do from personal experience. They WILL challenge authority when they have the numbers to do so and it will be political initially, though they will resort to overt violence at the first opportunity because violence WORKS. No offense meant of course, well!! maybe to muslims:) Rememeber, THERE IS NO ROOM IN A MUSLIM WORLD FOR A NON MUSLIM, EXCEPT AS A SLAVE.</p>

Islam, its Qur&rsquo;an, and its Ahadith do exactly that, and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, THEY ARE THE THREAT   &mdash;   and they have no place in the USA or any other civilized country.</p>

		<p>Americans are too busy trying to survive these days to commit any hate crimes. But I&rsquo;m sure there are many,probably millions like me who don&rsquo;t like muslims, don&rsquo;t trust them and don&rsquo;t think they belong in America. Islam is akin to a cancer to any American capable of rational thought. </p>

<p>Yes, race is important in determining behavior.  But we aren&rsquo;t robots.  Materialists reject the importance cultural and social structures have on shaping the behaviors of people.  This is why Islam is extremely dangerous  &mdash;  more so than poor blacks.</p>

		<p>Eva, don&rsquo;t kid yourself.  Those dapper Arabs have it in for you just as much as the Somali Muslims do,  because of their religion.  The difference does lie in the fact that the Arabs are more educated, though - they know what &#8220;taqiyya&#8221; is, and are adept at practicing it.  </p>
<p>Oh, it means they&rsquo;re good at lying to your face, and pretending to get along until Islam is ascendant and they have the upper hand.</p>
<p>And the bottom line is, if you&rsquo;re not Muslim, you&rsquo;re not worthy to live.  That&rsquo;s Islam.</p>

<p>Not so in  France, where they are North African and also sub-Saharan African. From France, they can spread out all over Europe; and they do. </p>
<p>Mostly Turks in  Germany, Pakis in Britain. But Moslems are by no means limited to the &#8220;Middle East&#8221;.  And the ubiquitous (and highly fertile) Somalis (Africans!) are by now everywhere, even in Finland,  spreading the blessings of their wonderful diversity to every white country.</p>
<p>None of the white countries affected wanted this! No one ever voted for it!  Nobody was asked or given a  choice.  It is a tabooed topic   &mdash;   in some countries illegal even to question.  Who is behind this? </p>
<p>Rather than waste time ranting against Moslems and Mexicans, who are only the symptoms (and yes, I agree they are troublesome enough) but NOT THE CAUSE, we should be searching for the root of the illness&rsquo; That lies among us, I&rsquo;m afraid.  Those ignorant Somalis and Mexicans ABSOLUTELY do not have the power to enter and settle in the USA  without enjoying powerful backing.  Without such support and tacit blessing, they have no power to do anything.  They could all be removed within a week, if we had the will. But we can&rsquo;t. We are helpless in the face of this invasion;  our governments and &#8220;representatives&#8221; are against us!   Why does our government (and all white governments) collaborate with them against the wishes of its own people?    Why do our governments allow us no choice?  Why  is the whole subject placed beyond the boundaries of legitimate discussion and made unmentionable?  THAT is the Big Question we should be addressing!</p>

		<p>Not all Arabs are Moslems and not all Moslems are Arabs. Many of the Arabs of Lebanon were practicing Christians millenia before Europe was converted. Likewise, most of the Moslems of Iran and Afganistan are not Arabs; they are Indo-Europeans. Iran has always allowed Christians and Jews to practice their religions.<br>
I was born in Germany, raised in the US, and have taught at Iranian universities. My extended family includes both Christians and Moslems in Germany, France, the US, and Iran. They are highly successful, sophisticated professionals.<br>
I was shocked at the naivete of many of the readers who attacked my comment. Mr. Preparation-H is representative. &#8220;They&#8221; (apparently Moslems), &#8220;have no place in the USA or any other civilized country.&#8221; The stance is that of an undereducated, lower class person. I remind Preparation-H that the US is founded on freedom of religion. Whether the US is a &#8220;civilized country&#8221; is in doubt.<br>
A &#8220;civilized country&#8221; would not attack and carry out mass murder in countries which pose no threat to it as the US is doing in Iraq, Afganistan, and Libya.  </p>

<i>&#8220;Why waste time ranting against Moslems and Mexicans, who are only the symptoms and not the illness?&#8221; </i></p>
<p><br>
Ghw:  I agree that we should not waste more time on  the symptoms than the sickness. Unfortunately,  that is quite common here, and on most other sites as well.</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two types who do this:   those naive persons who see only the superficial problems and not the deeper cause.  And secondly,  those who do want us to see the deeper cause,  so they distract us with the superficial problems.</p>
<p>This is a complex &#8220;war&#8221; that we are in, full of devious and subtle propaganda on the one side,  and with naive but clueless and well meaning people on the other.  And yes, it is a war, whether many of us  know it or not! This is not a simple matter of the Mexican family down the street who play mariachi music all night and litter their front yard with beer cans.  This comes from the highest levels and it is going on worldwide. </p>
<p>Getting rid of that Mexican family will accomplish nothing. It is like cancer   &mdash;   you have to get the problem  out <b>at the root. </b></p>

		<p>Eva- I am a former Muslim convert who was married to a Muslim and suffered horrible physical, emotional and financial abuse almost daily for nearly 3 years. Most of the other American women who were married to Muslims suffered the same fate. Most of the Muslims I knew were not interested in fitting into the American way of life- they were here for what they could get and to hell with all of us! We did not attack any innocent civilians for the hell of it- we were attacked on 9-11. Iraq was murky going in but again we did not just go to attack innocent people. I listened to horrible insults about my country and people and I agree with the other posters here- if you have no desire to assimilate or if your religion has a desire to dominate all other religions as Islam does then you truly have no place here!</p>

		<p>12 Eva: The Founders established this nation for themselves and their posterity, not for Moslems, a culture that has been an enemy of the West from its beginnings.  They really have no legitimate place in America or Europe, any more than U.S. and European forces belong in Libya or Afghanistan or Iraq.   <br>
 <br>
     In America, the people you call &#8220;lower class&#8221;, and I call &#8220;working class&#8221;, have rights too.  We are under no obligation to listen respectfully to arrogant professionals who would drown us with foreigners.  Foreigners who, despite your  highly successful, sophisticated, professional extended family, are far less civilized than the average redneck.  It&rsquo;s our country, and we have every right to decide who we let in, and we are not so undereducated as to trust the policies of intellectuals and politicians who despise us.</p>

<p>They did not establish it as a haven for all the disgruntled, greedy, or rootless  peoples of the world.  Nor to become a tangled babel for all the world&rsquo;s religions.   Unfortunately, it has since been perverted to accommodate that newer meaning  (thanks to Emma Lazarus et al).</p>

		<p>Any so-called &#8220;religion&#8221; that condones or promotes so many perverse and evil behaviors is no religion at all:</p>
<p>Religious Genocide (aka, Jihad: &#8220;kill the disbelievers wherever we find them: Sura 2:191. The infidels are your sworn enemies: Sura 4:101), following the example of Mohammed himself. <br>
Murder (suicide killing of innocents in name of God, honor killings, hanging of homosexuals, etc). <br>
Polygamy (a man may take up to four wives, as did Mohammed himself) <br>
Pedophilia (Mohammed married a 6-yr old: many muslims take 12-yr old wives today: half of all Pashtun men have a bacha baz, a boy lover) <br>
Adultery (a man may take concubines, as did Mohammed himself) <br>
Incest (a man may marry siblings or cousins, as did Mohammed himself) <br>
Misogyny: gender inequality, debasement of all women to status of mere property; every female, regardless of age, must belong to a male as his absolute property. Court testimony of a woman is worth one-half that of a man. Women can&rsquo;t leave home without male, must wear burkha in public. <br>
Religious intolerance (Koran&rsquo;s penalty is death for slander of Islam, or for conversion to any other religion ) <br>
Taqiyya (cheating, stealing, and lying, even under oath, in name of God); <br>
Dhimmitude (infidels, as less than equal, must pay unbeliever&rsquo;s tax to reside under Sharia law) <br>
no free speech (first amendment) <br>
abrogation (later koranic passages supercede earlier passages when they contradict each other). </p>
<p>And, between taquiyya and abrogation, an intelligent muslim (aka educated, highly successful professionals) will lie or maneuver his way out of any meaningful argument, and in good conscience. <br>

Please allow me to correct several errors in your response:<br>
1. Factual error: the deist quasi-Protestant &#8220;Founders&#8221; established a secular nation. While they were reluctant to allow Catholics and Jews to reside in the colonies, they certainly did not concern themselves with Moslems.<br>
2. Imprecision: Islam was founded in the 7th century AD. In what way was it &#8220;an enemy of the West since its beginning?&#8221;<br>
3. Error of definition: China and Iran are ancient civilizations. France and Italy are old civilizations. Jingoistic lower class and red neck Americans have no civilization.<br>
4. Grammatical error: &#8220;It&rsquo;s our country and we have every right to decide WHO we let in.&#8221; The &#8220;WHO&#8221; should be a &#8220;WHOM.&#8221; (English is my second language. What&rsquo;s your first?)</p>

		<p>Eva, it is a fact, not an opinion, that many Muslim immigrants are fanatical, viciously anti-American, and willing and eager to give aid to terrorists. Not all of them are like that, but enough of them are that way that it&rsquo;s basic common sense not to let them in. And let&rsquo;s not forget that even the peaceful ones don&rsquo;t have a &#8220;right&#8221; to immigrate to America. Immigration is a privilege, not a right. The proper purpose of immigration is to benefit the host country, not to provide a safe haven for every refugee with a sob story, true or not.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t attack us at Amren over the Mideast wars. We didn&rsquo;t start any of them. Afghanistan was legitimate. We retaliated against the people who attacked us. Iraq was started by a racially disloyal white politician who has always been hostile to white interests. Libya was started by a black leftist who hates white people, white conservatives especially. We here are blameless. Ah, the sweet irony of someone trying to bash white race realists for a war started by a black hate-whitey militant.</p>
<p>Gotta get that America-bashing in, too, dontcha, with your false accusations of &#8220;war crimes&#8221; against my country. We take great effort to avoid &#8220;civilian&#8221; casualties - too much. That&rsquo;s what went wrong with Afghanistan - those Muslim terrorists don&rsquo;t wear uniforms, so every terrorist with an AK can scream &#8220;Civilian!&#8221;</p>

		<p>There is not just a serious problem with Muslim immigrants wanting to take over America, there is a rapidly growing number of natural-born American citizens who are converting to Islam.  As if immigrant Muslims were not bad enough.</p>
<p>There is, for example, a mosque on the Navajo Indian reservation in the Southwest.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the case of John Walker Lindh, American Muslim converts are just as much a danger to our country, as immigrant Muslims.</p>
<p>I am for the First Amendment right of every American to choose whatever religion one wants to practice, or to not have any religion at all.  Even the right to be an agnostic or an atheist.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, despite liberal myths about Islam being a religion of peace, the Koran is incompatible with a secular government like ours granting freedom of religion and freedom from religion.  Make no mistake about it, Islam has no counterpart of Liberal Christianity, Reform Judaism, or Unitarianism!  Muslims take every word of the Koran literally that they must kill or convert all &#8220;infidels&#8221;!</p>
<p>In WW2, we had the threat of the Nazis, during the Cold War, we had the threat of the Communists.  Today, we have the threat of an ever-increasing Islam that wants to conquer the entire world!</p>

1. The Founders established a non-sectarian national government for the nation.  The states were free to regulate religion as they saw fit.  The Founders did not wish to have the federal government insert itself into state matters, nor would the states have accepted federal authority over their internal affairs.  The lack of any mention of Moslems does not mean that the Founders welcomed them, any more than the absence of references to Sharia means that they wanted to stone adulterers.  Such things were simply unthinkable.  They still are, to real Americans.<br>
2. Islam has been an enemy of the West from the time of Mohammed.  Conversion by the sword, remember?  Tours, Jerusalem, Constantinople, Vienna?  <br>
3. The civilization that rednecks are part of is rooted in a set of cultural attitudes that evolved in America when British subjects placed themselves beyond easy reach of Royal authority.  More formally known as &#8220;Jacksonian democracy&#8221;, this civilization is distinguished from its British parent by the belief that a commoner was capable of managing his own business and need not kneel to people of greater power, wealth, or schooling.  It&rsquo;s the civilization of Mark Twain and Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Willa Cather, John Muir and George Gershwin.  It is still a new civilization, with many enemies within and without, but French and Italian civilizations were new once too.  <br>
4. It&rsquo;s obvious that English is your second language.  No native speaker would make themselves look so foolish by criticizing someone for failing to use an obsolete, quaint word like &#8220;whom&#8221;.  In 1937, H.L. Mencken wrote that the word was schoolmarmish, and Noah Webster said that it was useless back in 1783.  Use it yourself, by all means, but hectoring an American for writing in his own national idiom is simply arrogant.  What would you say if I ridiculed a German for using the Swabish dialect?  <br>
     You have made my case.  Your contempt for working class Americans is obvious.  Even our language is faulted for not conforming to your bias.  There&rsquo;s no reason that we should respect your views when it&rsquo;s obvious you care nothing for our concerns.  It&rsquo;s no surprise that you get on so well with edumicated Iranians.  I was living in Los Angeles 30 years ago when a horde of them appeared, running from the Ayatollah Khomeni.  True to their ancient culture, they regarded every ordinary American as trash, just as they regard their lower-class countrymen as dirt beneath their feet.  Not only do we not want Moslems in our country, we don&rsquo;t want White, wannabe aristocrats either.  Our country, our civilization, our people, our rules.  </p>

<p>This country is NOT Islamophobic, Homophobic, Judophobic, or Martianophobic. This country is &#8220;Naziphobic.&#8221; Any white person who doesn&rsquo;t worship the other races and hate himself is a Nazi. Any white person that doesn&rsquo;t support affirmative action is a Nazi. Any white person that tries to cut government spending for minorities is a Nazi. Any white person who wants to stop immigration is a Nazi. Any white person that doesn&rsquo;t want to pay for someone else&rsquo;s medical is a Nazi. Any white person that posts on Amren is a Nazi.</p>

		<p>Notice that Eva said that she was born in Germany, not that she is German&hellip;necessarily. Her hatred of Americans isn&rsquo;t typical of the Germans that I&rsquo;ve met.  She said that some of her extended family include Moslems in Germany and that she has taught at Iranian universities.  Perhaps what she meant to say was that ALL of her relatives living in German are Moslems.  </p>
<p>To refer to Eva as a White, wannabe aristocrat might have been a bit of an overreach.    </p>

<p>As a modern, white European, it is dishonest that you associate yourself with Muslims and blacks.</p>
<p>Most people in most nations have the ability to educate and refine themselves.</p>
<p>However, as members of the white race, whose people have endured the loss of hundreds of millions to war and amalgamation over thousands of years, it is time to understand that their is no valid use in intermingling with blacks in the very areas in which we live and bear new life.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism places the very future of whites at risk no matter how intellectual non-whites are.<br>

		<p>Third world immigrant populations are replacing whites in the west because whites are not replacing themselves. Birth rates in western countries are below replacement levels due to contraception and the killing of white infants before birth. Those peoples who do not practice the two evils of contraception and abortion will prevail.</p>

		<p>There is no such thing as a &#8220;moderate&#8221; muslim.  All muslims are commanded  to follow the koran. The way the koran is written, the later passages take precedence over the earlier passages.  The concepts of &#8220;taquiya&#8221; (lying and deception to further islamic aims) and &#8220;dhimmi&#8221; (subordinating ALL non-muslims to the will of islamic society  &mdash;  those that the muslims deem worthy of being spared death) are integral to islamic &#8220;faith&#8221; and are immutable principles to muslims.<br>
islam is NOT a religion, but rather a system of government which has NO PLACE in American society.  The sooner we rid ourselves of this foreign government system the better.</p>

<p>The subsequent posts after mine (#11) only serve to confirm what I had said: </p>
<p>that we waste precious time and energy on unsubstantial nonsense, losing track of the real issues and  missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<p> Rather than going after the source of our problems, here   are a great number of posters fussing about Eva&rsquo;s place of birth  (who really cares?&hellip;but Hans got it right, btw) and bickering over grammar and the spelling of &#8220;whom&#8221;!   It really makes <br>
one despair.</p>
<p>Most of us know the difference between &#8220;who/whom&#8221;, Eva;  but since when is Amren supposed to be a grammar manual?  Should that be our concern?  There are bigger issues to concern us. Should we allow ourselves to be sidetracked like this?</p>
<p>And let me add, furthermore, that Eva&rsquo;s expressed contempt  (however grammatically   correct) for the &#8220;rednecks&#8221; she lives amongst ill befits a guest living in someone else&rsquo;s country. It may be good grammar, but vry bad manners!  </p>
<p>If I went to live in Slobbovia, I would be careful not to tell the inhabitants that they were  Slobs. As a guest in their country, I would owe them that respect.</p>

		<p># 28 gwh: So, what is the real issue, the source of our problems?  Perhaps it&rsquo;s something outside the domain of AmRen?  Not every website and every article and every post need be concerned solely with ultimate causes.  As Lincoln said, if you can&rsquo;t skin, you can hold a leg.  </p>

<p>&#8220;Not all Arabs are Moslems and not all Moslems are Arabs. Many of the Arabs of Lebanon were practicing Christians millenia before Europe was converted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry Eva, but if this statement is a reflection of your historical knowledge and intellectual sophistication, then you lose.  Europeans were largely converted to Christianity by the time Islam was invented.  Olav Tryggvason came from England with many ships and men in the summer of AD 995. He came to claim the throne of Norway and to bring Christianity to the country. He went ashore on the island of Moster on the west coast of Norway. He was accompanied by several English priests and a bishop called Grimkjell. On the island Olav Tryggvason held the first official mass in Norway. About 35 years later Norway was officially a Christian country.</p>
<p>Many &#8220;Christians in Norway and England wore both Christian Crosses and Thors Hammer.  Many grave stones feature both.  However, Norway was the last European hold-out.  All others, including Sweden and Denmark had long since been Christianized.  German tribes were half Arian Christian by the fourth century.  How you miss that as a &#8220;German&#8221; I cannot guess.  Selective education, perhaps?</p>
<p>But whites everywhere would serve themselves best if they were to return to Odin and Thor.</p>
