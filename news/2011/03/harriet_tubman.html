<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Harriet Tubman has history on her side. But does she have the votes?</p>
<p>The famous abolitionist is locked in a historical steel-cage match with the increasingly forgotten patriot John Hanson  &mdash;  one that&rsquo;s playing out not far from John Hanson Highway in Annapolis, where Maryland lawmakers, historians and activists have been debating whether to refresh the state&rsquo;s history by dumping Hanson in favor of Tubman.</p>
<p>At stake: one of 100 marble pedestals in the exclusive if not always accessible National Statuary Hall Collection at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>For the past 108 years, Hanson, a leading advocate of American independence, has been honored at the Capitol with a larger-than-life statue that the public almost never sees. Wearing a tricorn hat, waistcoat, breeches and other colonial-era clothes, the old Southern Marylander&rsquo;s 7-foot, 3-inch bronze likeness peers down at lawmakers and legislative aides rushing through a restricted-access corridor outside the Senate chamber.</p>
<p>Hanson was a member of the Continental Congress and in 1781 was elected as &#8220;President of the United States in Congress Assembled.&#8221; But as time marches on, he slips deeper into the margins of history, his legacy imperiled even in his home state.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t even know who he is,&#8221; Leslie Rowland admitted from College Park, where she teaches mid-19th-century American history at the University of Maryland.</p>
<p>Now Hanson could be in jeopardy of fading even further into obscurity, with Maryland lawmakers considering a proposal to replace the former slave owner with a hero of the Underground Railroad.</p>
<p>Tubman, who was born into slavery in Dorchester County, on Maryland&rsquo;s Eastern Shore, would be the first African American and the 10th woman in the 100-member marble-and-bronze club that Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) has called a &#8220;diversity embarrassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The collection reflects basically a white male view of history,&#8221; said Linda Mahoney, president of the Maryland chapter of the National Organization for Women, which has lobbied for the Tubman statue. &#8220;It&rsquo;s time to update Maryland&rsquo;s representatives in National Statuary Hall and take a different look at history.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Harriet Tubman is the ultimate icon, especially for women and African Americans. She&rsquo;s an obvious selection.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Racial and gender divide</p>
<p>The debate is fraught with potential land mines on race and gender. The key players for the most part have spoken cautiously about the bill, which has considerable support among women and African Americans, Mahoney said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Most historians say that Hanson&rsquo;s role as President of the United States in Congress Assembled was more akin to House Speaker than POTUS. Still, Middleton likens the proposal to removing George Washington from the collection.<br>

		<p>Look how well the nation is faring since we have a more diverse society, with women and minorities dominating social, government and political outcomes.  All we need is more of the same to bring closer the time when women will realize how much they need men to protect them from harm, as in the pre-20th century world.  When the entire country is the Louisiana Superdome, men, and white men in particular, will come back into favor and get respect once more.  Until then, the grasping greed of special interest groups, like The National Organization for Women, The NAACP, The SPLC, La Raza, MECHA, etc., will continue to squabble over the corpse of America.  It&rsquo;s dead, my friends.  Get ready.</p>

		<p>This collection represents a &#8220;white male view of history.&#8221; Horror of horrors, except that up until recent decades, this nation was over 80% white. Blacks and leftists certainly do not consider Apartheid Africa, with its majority white government lording over a black populus, to be a particularly healthy chapter in South African history. So why are they so eager to replicate it here.</p>
<p>We were all hectored that Obama&rsquo;s election marked a transcendant moment in our history. After an uninterrupted slew of white presidents, a black man had finally broken the mould and it was a new day. Fine, except, as I point out above, the nation was majority white and its leaders were a healthy reflection of that. The nation is still majority white (not for long) and we are now to celebrate the ascension of a member of a class that represents 13% of the population (with whom he has little in common, except skin color) and we call it progress? Strange. </p>

		<p><i> Harriet Tubman has history on her side. But does she have the votes? </i> </p>
<p>From the very first sentence, this &#8220;impartial&#8221; MSM writer shows their bias.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The collection reflects basically a white male view of history,&rdquo; said Linda Mahoney, president of the Maryland chapter of the National Organization for Women</i> </p>
<p>You can almost see the venom dripping from her lips as she says that.</p>
<p><i>Hanson was a member of the Continental Congress and in 1781 was elected as &ldquo;President of the United States in Congress Assembled.&rdquo; But as time marches on, he slips deeper into the margins of history</i></p>
<p>I thought that was the whole purpose of statues: to remind people of historical events that might otherwise be forgotten.</p>
<p><i> Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) has called a &ldquo;diversity embarrassment.&rdquo; </i> </p>
<p> Obviously a liberal who apparently thinks the whole history of the US was &#8220;an embarrassment.&#8221;</p>
<p><i> Now Hanson could be in jeopardy of fading even further into obscurity, with Maryland lawmakers considering a proposal to replace the former slave owner </i> </p>
<p>Slave owner? So were Washington and Jefferson. So I would assume they are the next to go?</p>
<p>A quick glance at the comments on the original story shows a general level of cluelessness, including some arguing that John Hanson was actually a black man and the nation&rsquo;s &#8220;first black president&#8221; who was &#8220;beat down&#8221; and &#8220;oppressed&#8221;  &mdash;  just like poor Obama.</p>

		<p>&hellip; . Harriet Tubman is the ultimate icon, especially for women and African Americans. She&rsquo;s an obvious selection.</p>
<p>I would agree with this statement if this was a debate for statues of African Americans and/or women.  If you put Harriet Tubman up against our Founding Fathers to debate who had the biggest impact on America, it is not even close.</p>
<p>So&hellip;</p>
<p>Who did more for our country?  The answer to this question should get the spot.  And when I say who did more I mean who physically did more, inspiration doesn&rsquo;t count.</p>

		<p>Of course, John Hanson fought for a country that had more freedoms than the one that lorded over it previously, and Harriet Tubman became a beneficiary of this (along with all other Americans, unknown history professors inclusive).  But the fact he was a noble and honorable patriot is less important than the fact he was a white male.  You see, we should honor people who aren&rsquo;t white or male, and when we do this is raaaacist.</p>

		<p>When Prez. Ronald Reagan signed the bill that trashed the Washington and Lincoln holidays, he signed the  declaration of surrender of traditional America. By replacing the statue of a dead white man with a dead black female, the victors are, in effect, occupying conquered territory.</p>

		<p>Remember that George Washington&rsquo;s statue was recently concealed by the NAACP. Is there a list of statues or other historical items disappearing in the dead of night nationwide? There are the Confederate Battle Flag and Confederate monuments being moved/hidden then disappearing all together, but I can&rsquo;t remember what ones. Once people stop talking about it I too am guilty of forgetting. An old courthouse in mobile, AL, used to have four statues over the entrance (Moses, Solomon, plus two more). I have asked many people but no one remembers them. I &lsquo;ll have to go to archives and see if I can find pictures. </p>

		<p>During renovations to the Texas State Capital in the 90s A confederate monument inside the capital was removed and replaced with a memorial to black reconstruction legislators. George W Bush<br>
had Confederate Plaques removed from the State Judicial building just prior to his nomination to run for President. Last year a dorm<br>
at the University of Texas,which was named after a legendary law professor, was renamed, and Sanford Levinson, a current Professor at the Law School, has called for the removal of Confederate Monuments from the grounds of the State Capital. So far Rick Perry hasn&rsquo;t caved in.</p>
