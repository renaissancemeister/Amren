<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Todd L. Shepard talked for years about killing police and igniting a revolution but people &#8220;didn&rsquo;t take it seriously,&#8221; a former friend testified today in Shepard&rsquo;s first-degree murder trial in the slaying of a University City police sergeant.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was absolutely no question he had a complete disdain for police, with police authority,&#8221; said Ryan Harshmann, who identified himself as a friend in 2007-08. &#8220;It had more to do with the uniform than the face behind the uniform. Once you put on the police uniform, you were the enemy to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Officials have said they know of no connection between Shepard and Sgt. Michael King until Shepard allegedly walked up to King&rsquo;s parked patrol car on Leland Avenue and Delmar Boulevard about 10:20 p.m. Oct. 31, 2008, and fired five shots with a stolen .38 caliber pistol.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Melody Newsom, Shepard&rsquo;s fiancée, told the court she had known him about 20 years and had lived with him almost four years. He talked daily, she said, about starting a revolution &#8220;to make things better for the lower class people with the killing of police.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McCulloch, prosecuting the case personally, is seeking a death sentence for Shepard.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Shepard is already serving a 23-year federal prison sentence on an unrelated drug charge.</p>

		<p>This man with revolution on his mind may one day wind up an American success story like Angela Davis who in 1970 purchased weapons used to kidnap and murder a Superior Court Judge named Harold Haley.  It was Jonathan Jackson, 17, who smuggled guns owned by Davis into a Marin County courtroom in San Rafael, Calif, and armed three black convicts. They then attempted to escape by using the judge, an assistant district attorney and three women jurors as hostages. Judge Haley was later murdered.  Angela Davis was freed (after much media hoopla, remember Rodney King) and went on to run for vice-president of The Communist Party USA but was defeated. After spending some time in Cuba she went on to become an esteemed and celebrated professor of Feminist Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz where she teaches young white liberal idiots.  </p>

  &mdash;  -<br>
Communist revolutionaries use jargon more highly developed than &#8220;make things better for the lower class people.&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement sounds more like an awkwardly sanitized paraphrase of what the killer really spoke about daily for years.</p>

		<p>Bob McCulloch was one of the infamous &#8220;truth squaders.&#8221;  If anyone needs the back story, let me know.  And the irony is that this murder happened a few days before the Presidential election, about a month and a half after he and the two others formed the &#8220;truth squad.&#8221;</p>
<p>University City is a suburb that is black on the north end and white liberal (associated with Washington University) on the south end.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Shepard, the similarities between he and the Hutaree are many, except:  (1)  He&rsquo;s a lot darker,  (2)  He actually killed a cop (allegedly), and (3)  He did it in the name of racist black extremism bordering on extreme leftism in general.  Ergo, the SPLC won&rsquo;t use his name and images to raise money.</p>
<p>Local radio reported that Shepard said he wanted to kill cops &#8220;because the ballot box wasn&rsquo;t working.&#8221;  What does he mean by the &ldquo;ballot box not working?&rdquo;  Lyndon Johnson won 61% of the popular vote, the highest of any candidate in a genuinely contested Presidential election in American history, and then rode that mandate into signing every anti-police civil rights bill that neutered the cops that came to his desk.  Barack Obama won 365 electoral votes and then said that the Cambridge, Mass. P.D. Sergeant &ldquo;acted stupidly&rdquo; because he dared to arrest a belligerent black man who was in the middle of a publicity stunt.  (Yeah, I&rsquo;m still riding that horse.)  And, as it sadly turns out, the Republicans in the state leigslature are going to give the SLPD back to the city (another back story I&rsquo;ll provide if needed) so that the wackos who constitute city government can put in a civilian review board which will even further handcuff white cops in the face of black crime.  Seems like the ballot box IS working, and all you have to do is vote Republocrat.</p>

		<p>Of course, this is a disgrace and a tragedy.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;d like to relate a situation I observed this last weekend. I&rsquo;m a walker and when I was out walking Sunday morning, I passed a policeman sitting in his patrol car texting. in a deserted picnic grounds parking lot. I passed not 10ft away from him and he never looked up and I just continued on my way. Some time later, while coming home from a different direction, once again I encountered the same ploicemen, sitting in his car at another parking lot, texting. Once again, I passed very close to his car and he never looked up. If I&rsquo;d have been a bad guy out to shoot him, he would&rsquo;ve been dead either time.</p>
<p>These are extremely dangerous times and to be so unawares is unacceptable. This is not the first time I&rsquo;ve observed the police not acting correctly and I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t be the last.</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m not saying Sgt. King was texting or anything, but I feel he may not have been as alert as he should have been.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to us all. Don&rsquo;t get caught unawares by these bums, if possible.</p>

<p><br>
The truth is that Angela Davis was framed. She did know the Soledad brothers, but she did not purchase the gun nor did she smuggle any guns in the courthouse. Those were trumped up charges against her. That is why she was acquitted. </p>
<p>I am not a fan of this phony communist, who lives a opulent, capitalist, but your post is inaccurate in regards to facts. <br>

		<p>Who was that low-life black that killed the white serviceman and became a darling of the left? Mumba or something? I think he finally met his maker. Call out Mike Farrell and co. and make this guy the oppressed, write a book, make a movie, etc. And BTY&hellip;Angela Davis received the key to the city of Little Rock  &mdash;  courtesy of former mayor Buddy Villines. And I, too, have not nor will forget BHO&rsquo;s response to the set-to in Cambridge or henchman Holder&rsquo;s answer to black panthers at polling site, nor numerous other blatant acts of uncivility (to put it mildly).</p>

		<p>All you PC liberal &#8220;we&rsquo;re all the same&#8221; whites who might be reading this (Timmy Wise from Nashville, e.g.), imagine being this guy.  He&rsquo;s a mongrel &amp; knows it.  There used to be laws against creating offspring like this; now common sense must be relied upon.</p>
<p>I wonder what the percentage is of the male who fathers such people, white or black?</p>
<p>Maybe 95% of the time the woman is white &amp; the man is black?</p>
<p>Just a guess based on what I&rsquo;ve observed.  And, I&rsquo;m not young.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve NEVER seen a white man leading his family around, say, a mall, with a black wife &amp; a brood of black/mulatto kids.  I&rsquo;ve seen the opposite many times.</p>

		<p>When I saw the given name &#8220;Todd&#8221;, I wondered if this killer could be black.  I immediately thought that if he is (before I viewed the photo) then he probably has a white mother.  And how many of such mothers intentionally become pregnant by black thugs just to poke a stick in the eyes of white society?  </p>

		<p>So the Prosecutor will be seeking the Death Penalty. That sounds about right. Hurry up and get the trial over with, so this slime bag murderer can take up his new residence in Hell.</p>
<p>As for Tom Irons seeing that same Cop in a Park, texting, what a waste of time, the Cop should be doing his job by being alert, and looking around for potential problems, or criminal acts. He can help no one, including himself, if he is not constantly vigilant. </p>
<p>Tom, the next time you see a Cop on Duty, in his car, or out on a foot post, and he is not paying attention to his surroundings, please report that Officer to his Commanding Officer at his Precinct. Take the Patrol Car number, or location of the Officer, and make a phone call.</p>
<p>You may well save that Officer&rsquo;s life, after being reprimanded, for deraliction of duty, and let&rsquo;s also remember that he is working, and drawing a salary, with benefits, that most of us don&rsquo;t have, so staying focused on the job he wanted should not be too much to ask of him.</p>

<p>Sentencing hearing began today.</p>
<p>Money quotes from this article:</p>
<blockquote>On the witness stand, Shepard said he became agitated at home in Berkeley the morning of Oct. 31, 2008, because he saw then-presidential candidate Barack Obama on TV, saying in an answer to a question that he would not seek an endorsement from the controversial National of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan.
<p>Shepard said it made him mad enough to tear up his voter registration card and flush it down the toilet. McCulloch asked how, as a convicted felon, he could have been registered to vote. Shepard insisted that he was.</p>
<p>Shepard said he had lunch at a Red Lobster restaurant, where a waitress wore a name tag that said &#8220;Truth,&#8221; and he heard her talk to others about being revolutionary. He said it reminded him of how activist Malcolm X used to talk about people who used the term loosely.</p>
<p>On an errand later to buy drugs, Shepard said, he drove through &#8220;enemy territory&#8221; in University City on a &#8220;reconnaissance mission&#8221; to look for police, as he had done dozens of times before.</p>
<p>He said he noticed a white male officer  &mdash;  not King  &mdash;  walking a beat on Delmar Boulevard. &#8220;I remember saying to myself that would be a good way to start a revolution there, by knocking a patch off the back of his head.&#8221; But he said he kept going because he could not find a parking place.</p>
<p>He said he passed up shooting a female officer in a patrol car because she was black. He described seeing King, parked on Leland Avenue, as &#8220;like a vision or something.&#8221;</p>
<p>King, 50, was monitoring Halloween night traffic along the Delmar Loop.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an aside, MO allows convicted felons to vote if their probation is complete.  I don&rsquo;t know if this Shepard&rsquo;s probation from his previous felony conviction was over.</p>
