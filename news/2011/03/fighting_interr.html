<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Authorities and witnesses said about 1,500 people were at the DMV music awards ceremony at the Crystal City [Arlington County, Virginia] Hyatt hotel when several fights erupted. Five people were treated at the scene and one was taken to a hospital, witnesses said. </p>
<p>The annual awards ceremony honors local performers in rap, hip-hop, go-go and R&B; categories. More than 40 awards were to be presented, and the ceremony was about halfway through when the fighting started about 9:45 p.m., according to witnesses. </p>
<p>One witness reported seeing as many as half a dozen fights. </p>

		<p> We could have easily guessed &#8220;who,&#8221; couldn&rsquo;t we? But I notice that the news report makes no mention of race. Normally I would assume this was to try to cover up the fact that blacks had caused yet another big ruckus. But maybe, considering the type of &#8220;music&#8221; that was featured, the writers figured we&rsquo;d be able to make the right choice, anyway.</p>

		<p>I saw the video.  They trashed that hotel.  In all honesty the hotel had to of known there was a high probability of something like this happening.  Can anyone really say they were totally shocked?  Yet they will continue to book hotels and conference rooms anytime, anywhere, while Amren will continue to be harrassed and restricted from booking many of the same hotels.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s a good night out without a few fights to spice things up? It&rsquo;s all a part of the cultural style of some groups. Blacks and Puerto Ricans usually have rampages during and after any event where you get a large number of them together. Trashing the place is part of their culture. If you&rsquo;re white then stay away if you value your health. </p>

<p>Naturally this was the kind of violence that Patrick Cannon was trying to avoid when he wrote a letter to that hotel in Charlotte, which was to host American Rennaissance. The artillery that gangsta rappers pack pales in comparison to the kind of violence that speakers like Jared Taylor or Sam Dickson are known to bring.</p>
<p>Just compare and contrast the uplifting lyrics of one of the rappers who attended this award show, and notice the stark contrast with the viciousness that Jared Taylor displays:</p>
<p>Fat Trel (DMV award winner)&#8221;No Secrets&#8221;:</p>
<p>We killing brothers <br>
We killing mothers <br>
We killing kids <br>
That&rsquo;s how it is <br>
I&rsquo;m sorry we getting it how we live </p>
<p>Jared Taylor:<br>
&#8220;We believe in complete freedom of association.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly one can see why the SPLC has Jared on its hate list as &#8220;one to watch.&#8221;</p>

4. Or was it that ignorant filthy disgusting c*ap the blacks call rap?</p>

One witness reported seeing as many as half a dozen fights. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Which means that if there are 4-6 blacks to a fight&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
Witnesses said police arrived in more than 20 vehicles. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>As the first responder numbers suggest, 20 cops in single patrol units rolling on a riot with some 24 participants gives you _just about_ man to man coveage.</p>
<p>So they can&rsquo;t jump you and then say you started it&hellip;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<br>
The cause of the fighting was not known. <br>
&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Of course not!  Because, as we all know, music in all cultures is about firing the blood and quickening the spirit without challenging the conscious mind at all.</p>
<p>Hence this altercation had nothing to do with calling women &#8216;hos&rsquo;, talking about using guns to handle &#8216;bidness&rsquo; by murdering rivals and police.</p>
<p>After all, did not Brahms, Bach, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and all the other Classical artists also render an image of society so ugly, weak and deserving of contempt that making a victim of ANY OR ALL it&rsquo;s members was as simple as turning to the individual next to you in a concert hall and setting to fisticuffs?</p>
<p>Happened all the time from the 1500s onwards.  I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

Here in Buffalo, this weekend, there was a rap concert downtown. There were two stabbings in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>In the same entertainment district, there was a robbery and a rape for which the media  provided no descriptions. Imagine that, a women was raped and they news media won&rsquo;t even give a description of the suspect.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, the Buffalo News ran an article about 7 rapes. They ran the story only after the seventh rape. After the first rape, six other women were raped because the Buffalo News didn&rsquo;t want to report that a black man was raping women.<br>

		<p>I&rsquo;m just glad it was not a mom &amp; pop operation that was trashed.  I&rsquo;m happy as can be seeing it was a &#8220;globalist&#8221; corporation that loves diversity.  I wish events like this happened to them every minute of every day.  Since these corporate fascists want to re-write (destroy) the American social order (founding race and culture), let&rsquo;s all sit back and watch as these globalists promote these people to the front of the line.  We can watch on the sidelines as the destruction gets worse and worse with each passing day and both groups eventually destroy each other.<br>

		<p>Films being shot on location require taking out insurance and I&rsquo;ve seen the questionnaire some insurance firms provide. Besides the predictable questions about dangerous stunts there is a question about having hip hop or rap music in the film. I assume that the insurance companies know the score. I have no idea of the extra cost but it must be substantial given the potential damage.</p>

		<p>Notice how the controlled media article declares that the fight just &#8220;broke out&#8221;, as if The Fight was a living entity with a mind of its own. </p>
<p>Just like when they write about black shootings. It&rsquo;s never &#8220;DeMarcus whipped out his &#8216;gat&rsquo; and shot Jamal,&#8221; it&rsquo;s, &#8220;the gun went off.&#8221; I guess guns are also living things with minds of their own.</p>

		<p>&#8220;You can take the blacks out of the jungle, but you can&rsquo;t take the jungle out of the blacks&#8221; most people would consider that statement to be racist but blacks prove that it&rsquo;s 100% correct on a daily basis.

		<p>I&rsquo;ve been at assorted raves where, despite much use of alcohol and &#8220;controlled illegal substances&#8221; there was little to no violence and everyone was generally mellow. Yet the government is on a jihad to shut down raves and rave culture. Compare this to rap. </p>
<p>I wonder if we will see law enforcement move against rap music, given its open violence? Or is there a political agenda here to go hands-off of rap? </p>
<p>Just a random thought&hellip;</p>
