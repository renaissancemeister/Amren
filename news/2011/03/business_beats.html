			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Gregory Rodriguez, Los Angeles Times, March 28, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Conservative Utah has bucked the national GOP trend of embracing hard-line  &mdash;  and arguably inhumane  &mdash;  laws meant to make states inhospitable to illegal immigrants. Two weeks ago, Utah Gov. Gary R. Herbert signed into law a bill that will grant work permits, and a path to legal residence, to undocumented immigrants and their immediate families.</p>
<p>And conservative Arizona, which last year passed the anti-immigrant law known as SB 1070, defeated a second slate of such measures, including one that sought to deny birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Surprised? You shouldn&rsquo;t be. There&rsquo;s nothing inherently conservative about taking a punitive line against illegal immigrants. Instead, as these votes in Utah and Arizona show, old-school conservatism  &mdash;  that of employers and business interests  &mdash;  just might be the key to finally dealing justly with the 11 million people living within our borders without papers.</p>
<p>Business&rsquo; first loyalty is to the bottom line. That tends to make businesspeople seem indifferent to social issues; they concentrate on balancing their books and staying afloat, not on saving the world. For the politically liberal, that smacks of meanness and greed. But cool pragmatism is the right antidote for passionate bigotry. In fact, despite all the time and energy Americans spend praising the wonders of tolerance and the virtues of inclusion, bottom-line values have throughout our history done about as much to fight bigotry as has any particular brand of high-minded moralism.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As Jonathan Koppell, dean of the public policy school at Arizona State University, says, &#8220;Most businesses are hard-pressed to let visceral emotions drive decisions to the point where the balance sheet suffers. In the marketplace, alienating a significant segment of the population is never a good strategy. Sadly, the same cannot be said of the political arena.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how did business meet politics in Utah and Arizona?</p>
<p>Utah saw the economic damage Arizona did to itself with SB 1070. The law, which prods police to question those they stop about their immigration status, drew boycotts and cost the state millions of dollars in tourism and convention business. Pushed by business leaders and the Mormon Church, politicians didn&rsquo;t repeat the mistake.</p>
<p>As for Arizona, with five more virulently anti-immigrant measures up for consideration, 60 state business leaders sent a letter to the Legislature asking them to not make matters worse.</p>
<p>None of this suggests that Republicans or most voters in these states are suddenly pro-illegal immigration. What it may mean, however, is that the pragmatism of pro-business conservatism is finally standing its ground against the emotionalism of social conservatism.</p>

		<p>Economics over all else is not (lower-case &#8216;c&#8221;) conservative   &mdash;   although it <i>is</i> consistent with contemporary <i>Movement</i> &#8220;Conservatism.&#8221; The contemporary American &#8220;Conservative(?)&#8221; movement, any thin top-dressing of support for social issues notwithstanding, is a collective cheerleader for corporate capitalism: It praises the regime of the Bourgeoisie as ruling class where this condition obtains, and advocates rule by the Bourgeoisie where this does not obtain. What calls itself &#8220;Conservatism&#8221; in America today is <i>short</i>-term tunnel-vision mono-maniacal economo-mania. Cheap labor is its holy grail. </p>

		<p>This argument rests on one of the biggest lies of the conservative agenda&hellip;&hellip;capitalism.</p>
<p>It is a lie that the US has a capitalist system and an even bigger lie that the rest of the western world is based on capitalism.  What we have is communism within an unstable rule of law.  What that means is, the law is ever in flux, unevenly applied and outright ignored by those that rule us (our democracy is nothing more than lies).  The law says one thing and is enforced to prevent competition, especially with regard to power in almost any sphere of life&hellip;.but literally does not exist for our elites.  Take for example, Obama&rsquo;s recent attack on Libya.  Set aside the fact that it barely makes any sense.  Obama mobilized our military at the command of the UN, ignoring Congress and killed a whole bunch of people with no justification whatsoever (unless you believe the taliban mercenaries Kadafi was killing were &#8220;his own people&#8221;&hellip;.lol).  These are serious crimes, even war crimes.  They should trigger an instant impeachment and imprisonment.  Instead, barely anything was said.  Rule of law?  There is none.</p>
<p>With regard to business.  Illegals do not make money for any business.  That is simply out of line with the reality of their productivity relative to their pay.  You pay them half what you would an american and get 10% of the productivity.  A huge net loss&hellip;.not counting the ocean of money they consume in welfare and law enforcement&hellip;.paid for mostly by business taxes.</p>
<p>No business person interested in making money would hire illegals&hellip;..because it loses money.  The idea that low pay increases profits is an outright lie.</p>
<p>So why are businesses hiring illegals?  The real reason is the people who run those businesses are nothing more than employees themselves.  The decisions they make don&rsquo;t effect their own salaries so they really don&rsquo;t care.  But most of those hired into those lucrative management positions are marxists.  Forty years ago, marxists were let in to many institutions by normal people.  They turned around and systematically eliminated non-marxists. They&rsquo;ve bent businesses away from making money towards, social justice.</p>
<p>Which is the real cause of our economy crashing.  How can you have a successful economy when those who run the institutions want to tear them down, holding them up only long enough for them to get theirs?</p>
<p>This is something whites are going to have to come to grips with.  Conservatives don&rsquo;t act like liberals, only less rabid because of greed.  If they did, you could negotiate with them&hellip;..buy them off.</p>
<p>Conservatives are simply the marxists who want the system to burn down to the ground and whites to be exterminated after they themselves have enjoyed their wealth.  They are believers.</p>
<p>Because of this, solutions to the white survival problem have nothing to do with voting or joining existing political groups (ie voting republican as opposed to democrat).  They begin with destroying those political groups&hellip;.or at least not cooperating.</p>
<p>When immigrants can&rsquo;t get the food, shelter, drugs, prostitutes and guns that they want because whites won&rsquo;t hand them over, that will be the beginning of a solution.</p>

		<p>Of course the business community wants more immigrants. More immigrants mean more customers and more job applicants. By the law of supply and demand that means higher prices, lower wages, and higher profits. </p>

		<p>Wait until he&rsquo;s fired because affirmative action has moved on from hispanics to some new minority Africans perhaps?</p>
<p>In the last 15 years blacks have been cleansed from affirmative action jobs by hispanics.  40 years ago Whites were cleansed from employment by blacks.  15 years from now employers will have found some new group and Rodriguez will be ethnically cleansed from his job by the newcomers.</p>

		<p>Dream on, left-wing loons.  Businesses appreciate customers who don&rsquo;t exhibit loud and vulgar behavior, shoplift, attack employees, or pay with rubber checks.  They don&rsquo;t want to have to pay through the nose for security and property insurance or close down and move because of white flight.  <br>
So why would they want &#8220;diversity&#8221;?</p>

		<p>In the marketplace, alienating a significant segment of the population is never a good strategy. Sadly, the same cannot be said of the political arena.&rdquo;&hellip;&hellip;so alienating Whites is not a problem? If this is what causes businesses to listen then Whites need to get organized and boycott bussinesses who are lobbying the politicians to vote in their so-called interest to give illegals an easy path way to citizenship.As for politicians,they could care less also about alienating their White voter base.They&rsquo;ve been doing exactly that for the last 45 years since the immigration act of 1965&hellip;reaching out to minoritys while ignoring their White voter base.And now we hear Arizona voted to not deny citizenship to babies of illegals that are born here because of pressure from bussinesses?? Then Whites should now be boycotting Arizona&rsquo;s bussinesses..We need to get organized and fight back..The Whites in Arizona need to get the names of the 60 bussinesses who put pressure on its state leaders to shoot down that bill and a boycott of those bussinesses should begin.White consumers and voters in Utah need to throw their neo-con GOV out the door..conservative?? Blasphemy!! I think i need to go puke.</p>

		<p>Like it or not, Liberal Rodrigues makes a valid point: The people who run businesses are interested in maximizing next year&rsquo;s profits. Cheaper labor means higher profits in the short run. More immigration means cheaper labor. Therefore, business leaders work to increase immigration. QED</p>

		<p>&#8220;60 state business leaders sent a letter to the Legislature asking them to not make matters worse.&#8221;: It is obvious that neither our business leaders nor the majority of our politicians care for our Country. I&rsquo;m curious - are we allowed to write and discuss a new constitution?  Not something to overthrow the Government, but something that outlines a separation of nations based upon ethnicity should our current government reach a point of failure.  We would still have a confederation of nations of some sort, but not the open-borders free flow of people the New World Order has planned. The purpose would be that once we reach the (I believe) inevitable point of racial conflict, we have something which may be workable enough that we could implement a plan to avoid mass bloodshed and destruction. Think Czechoslovakia as compared to most other situations of national breakups that are done through violence.  We already have nationalists within the various racial camps, and our business leaders and politicians will only continue to exacerbate the deterioration of America.  It seems to me that since their plan is the destruction of America in general and of Whites in particular, that we should develop the best plan possible to save what land area we can while saving as many of our children as possible.  We will have to suffer in giving up lands that we once controlled (I know, we already have), but with the forces arrayed against us as they are, I don&rsquo;t see much for alternatives. It seems we should put forth something that people can see, read, and come to understand as a possible future option where we have some sense of racial survivability.  I can&rsquo;t see us ever transferring 100M+ people now, and 200M+ people by 2050, out of the continental U.S., and after that if anything, non-Whites will come to consider forcefully shipping White Americans back to Europe or having what&rsquo;s left of us put on a reservation in Northern Canada&hellip; if we&rsquo;re lucky.  P.S. For some reason I&rsquo;m having visions of White people dressed as Cherokee Indians&hellip; crying&hellip;</p>

		<p>Long sighted liberals want illegals or any immigrant policy that will bring them more votes.  Short sighted conservatives only see the money they will make paying lousy wages that no whites want.  Both contribute to the demise of the U.S., but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there.  Nearly every business and political endeavor results in weakening the majority white, host population that has provided America with its heart and soul for over 250 years.  That will soon be gone.  It will be interesting to see how all these greedy, politically expedient people will manage when there is no reserve culture to dip into for their various schemes.  Chaos and anarchy is what is coming.  More and more people are coming to that conclusion.  Everyone I talk to seems to have this on their minds these days.</p>

		<p>One news story on this was titled <i> Utah on immigration: We aren&rsquo;t Arizona</i>.  Pretty soon they won&rsquo;t be America, either.  Two things about this stand out - the first is how immigration policy is wholly irrational, how any immigration control at all is completely unacceptable because it might preserve even a trace of whiteness and anyone who does anything that promotes  that, even as an unintentional consequence, anyone who even suggests that it is acceptable,  is automatically a racist and a criminal in the eyes of the establishment.  The second is the role of business in our destruction.  These Chamber of Commerce types are traitors,  literally worse than communists.  Communist Poland or East Germany were never threatened with being overrun by Muslims or Africans,  but the EU Poland and Germany are.   And you can always come back from a bad economic system, you can&rsquo;t come back from racial extermination.  </p>

		<p>Famous economist Dr. Walter E. Williams (especially in his 1989 book <i>South Africa&rsquo;s War Against Capitalism</i>) and others have taken a position that libertarianism/capitalism is a means to overcome &#8220;racism&#8221; because the only color that matters is green. </p>
<p>If so, it is nothing to uphold as a virtue, but rather is a fatal flaw, a failure mechanism, whereby the system eventually destroys itself.     </p>

		<p>This is convenient argumentation on the part of the leftists when it suits their purposes. No such arguments were made by these same types when affirmative action laws were instituted, despite the fact that business doesn&rsquo;t need such laws to hire whoever will give the same quality of work for lower wages. Notice that the leftist Rodriguez conveniently ignores affirmative action in this piece, because it doesn&rsquo;t suit his purposes at the moment. Notice also that he ignores the fact that &#8220;illegal&#8221; means something that is <i>against the law</i>.</p>

		<p>Mr. Rodriguez should look at the history of conservative business practices such as those he advocates. Go back 200 years and he would see that certain business men knew there was a good profit to be made importing and keeping Africans as slaves. </p>
<p>The institution of slavery was good for the economy of the time. The factories of Europe were supplied with cheap raw materials and the American planters all lived in nice big mansions but what were the long term cost of this quick profit.</p>
<p>Heck, war is good for business in the short term but it never does the average citizen any good in the long run because they are the one&rsquo;s that end up paying for it.  </p>

		<p>According to the logic of the writer, prostitution, slavery, child labor, illegal immigration, organ harvesting, war, and selling illegal drugs are all good for business (they all make money for someone), and should be allowed.   </p>
<p>Basing societal decisions on just money and greed alone (i.e., &#8220;good for the economy&#8221;) is evil and wrong.  But that is exactly what these guys are trying to sell.  These global capitalists don&rsquo;t care about you, your family, or your culture   &mdash;   all they want is money, money, money, and if they destroy your family and nation, who cares?  They&rsquo;ll just stuff their plunder in a bag and move on to the next nation to exploit.  </p>

Social Democracy only works in countries where nearly everyone is white. A heterogeneous work force is more difficult to organize than a homogeneous work force. If whites become a minority in the United States about the only thing we can be sure of is that the vast majority of them will vote Republican, as they do in the South. <br>

		<p>The Republican Party exists in order to advance the economic interests of the richest ten percent of the country. Anything else Republican politicians talk about is an effort to win the votes of whites who are hurt by Republican economic policies. <br>
 <br>
If you keep that in mind you may be angered by what Republican politicians do. You will never be surprised. </p>

		<p>When the short sighted &#8220;capitalists&#8221; of big business and the chain stores/restaurants/hotels have flooded the country with cheap hispanic labor, they will have a perfect replica of cheap Mexican business and industry, complete with the inefficiencies, poor quality control, industrial theft, poor attendance records, and in fighting among groups.  They will also see, in their industries, rampant side line businesses from their property, as is seen in Mexico: fencing stolen goods, drug deals, pimping for time spent with child prostitutes, etc.  In short, when American greedy businesses have all the Mexican labor they cry for, they will have all the aspects of a Mexican industrial model also.</p>

		<p>The role of capitalism in white dispossesion is the elephant in the living room of the white nationalist movement.  Ever since Europeans took African slaves, the profit motive has been the main cause of treason among our people.  For the first time since the the immigration floodgates were opened in 1965, we are at a point where public anger over immigration is high enough to actually do something about it.  But now,  all the progress that we have made has been halted because of rich white men who don&rsquo;t want their supply of slaves cut off.  These people are traitors and should held in the same regard we have for people like the SPLC and Tim Wise.  Make no mistake, it&rsquo;s not a few bad apples here, virtually all white business owners and executives are on board with amnesty for illegal aliens and continued high levels of legal immigration.  We need to recognize that capitalists as a class are enemies and always have been and act accordingly.  </p>

		<p>Number 4, Anonymous, makes by far the best comment here. You anti-capitalism folks are living in the dark ages. What we have here is the fascist form of socialism combined with Communist control of education, culture and most media. <br>
If we had strict lassez-faire capitalism with no regulations, bailouts, tariffs, taxes, licenses, subsidies, no Fed, no welfare, no entitlements, no government miseducation,et., we&rsquo;d be fine. <br>
Slavery was first adopted as a humane alternative to the killing of war prisoners. The anti-capitalist South was kept back by slavery, in fact capitalism abolished slavery throughout most of the world. Socialism-Communism-Fascism reintroduced it.<br>
Number 26, you are trying to put over a pakage deal. War and slavery can only be instituted by government.<br>
Child labor, prostitution and all drugs should be legal. We can make our own choices here. 95% of the kids in school would be better off working. Organ harvesting if done voluntarily should be legal. If there was no safety net there would be no problem with illegal immigration. Adam Smith envisioned free movement of labor as well as capital. We don&rsquo;t need any more Drug Wars or tobacco prohibition or fetus fetishism. </p>

		<p>ATBOTL, I agree 100%.  I was going to write a similar comment.  The history of this country is about cheap labor.  And cheap labor usually means non-white labor.  Because America is a very powerful and influential nation the ideas of cheap labor has spread throughout the world especially to other white countries and they have followed the same path of using non-white as cheap labor sources.</p>

		<p>People here arn&rsquo;t necessarily &#8220;anti-capitalist&#8221;. Capitalism is an effective and efficient means of allocating resources to society. We just don&rsquo;t fetishize it to the extent that mainstream &#8220;conservatives&#8221; do that we put free market principles before other considerations. Capitalism is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p>
<p>The business class has always been one of our biggest enemies on the immigration question. Money and self-interest will ALWAYS come before everything else when they are involved, and especially when we remember that big business is one of the largest hotbeds of diversity worship. There is no academia-left / big business-right dichotomy. They&rsquo;re both loaded with liberals, or at least, race liberals.<br>

This argument rests on one of the biggest lies of the conservative agenda&hellip;&hellip;capitalism.</p>
<p>It is a lie that the US has a capitalist system and an even bigger lie that the rest of the western world is based on capitalism. What we have is communism within an unstable rule of law.<br>

 <br>
In other words, you do not like the economic status quo in the United States, so it cannot be capitalist. You remind me of Marxists I used to argue with who told me that the Soviet Union did not practice socialism, but state capitalism. </p>

		<p>Mr. Engelman, the US has never been a purely capitalist society and has been getting much less so since Wilson.<br>
If you look at the Communist Manifesto you will find that almost all of the planks have long since been US law and law in the rest of the world.<br>
Everything from government education to the FCC to the Fed (a fine example of central planning)and the list goes on. We much more resemble the fascist form of state socialism than any kind of free market. i&rsquo;m happy to supply many references here if you wish.<br>
Of course, Communism, the alleged withering away of the state, never came to pass in the former Sino-Soviet Bloc (s) but they all had state socialism which nonbody will deny.<br>
So your comment is a nonsequitur.</p>

		<p>It should be said that immigration policy is not driven by economics but by ideology.  It is a policy of genocide against white America and most of those who support it can be roughly divided into two categories: the genuinely hate-filled members of the Liberal/non-white/Democrat coalition and those who collaborate for profit or out of fear.  The economic aspects of modern immigration have been examined over and over again,  starting with the National Research Council&rsquo;s conclusion in 1997 that immigration added only 10 billion dollars to an economy then worth 10-12 trillion.   Of course these economic findings are never argued in public because they are part of the Eric Holder-style discussion of race in America - a one-sided conversation where anything that might aid in the survival of white America is prohibited.  Economics is a side-issue in the immigration debate,  immigration policy is racial, and the forces of genocide love it when their victims get side-tracked into trivial matters.  </p>

		<p>Nathaniel Branden,Jr., you&rsquo;re engaging in verbal fallacies(ie playing word games).  If the US in the late 19th Century, when &#8220;business interests&#8221; sought the mass importation of Asian coolie labor, was not a free market, laissez-faire, capitalist society, then no such society has ever or will ever exist.  </p>
<p>Do you actually believe that if we had no welfare, we would have no illegal immigration?  Do you advocate the free movement of labor across borders?</p>

		<p>The fact is that only real true measure of a nation&rsquo;s wealth is its GDP per capita.India might have a much greater aggregate GDP than Luxembourg, for instance, but as we all know Luxembourg is the &#8216;richer&rsquo; country.<br>
 Now GDP per capita is a function of productivity per capita.If a nation imports huge numbers of people with productivity below that of the natives (as the USA is currently doing with &#8216;hispanics&rsquo;), the GDP per capita (and thus the &#8216;real measure of the nation&rsquo;s wealth) falls, and the nation is poorer.<br>
    Eventually even the capitalist bosses currently profitting from mass immigration will be hit in the pocket themselves - paupers generally don&rsquo;t buy very much.</p>

		<p>From Australia: What has happened for the USA to sink so unbelievably low? I think our illegal refugees program is bad.. one look at a story like this and I truly think it is impossible. Who let this go on?? Why didn&rsquo;t anyone protest?? Here the PCness is mad too, but something that extreme would never happen hear.</p>

		<p>The US was nowhere near a laissez-faire economy in the 19th century, Lincoln instituted a dictatorship, went off the gold standard, abolished habeas corpus, the Feds subsidized internal improvements, gave subsidies for huge land grabs by the railroads, there were all sorts of laws inhibiting local businesses, anti-abortion laws were enacted, the venomous antitrust laws were enacted, the south was under military occupation. Read Louis Hacker, Clarence B. Carson and other real historians, and yes, IF all government education, welfare, medical care, social security, disability aid and civil rights laws in the private sector were abolished that would drastically illegal immigration. Illegal welfare immigration has been government sponsored a la LBJ&rsquo;s Great Society from the beginning. The railroads who brought in the coolies were exactly the ones given the federal grants. I have worked for employers who have specialized in hiring foreign cheap labor and they were paid by the Feds to do so.<br>
