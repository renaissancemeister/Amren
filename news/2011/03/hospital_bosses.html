			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Daily Mail (London), March 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The level of English among some foreign doctors is &#8216;absolutely awful&rsquo;, hospital bosses have said.</p>
<p>Some cannot even speak well enough to communicate with patients, they warned.</p>
<p>Bosses at Queen&rsquo;s Hospital in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, revealed the poor level of English in their doctors from overseas after complaints from both staff and patients.</p>
<p>Chief executive of the Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Helen Ashley said many of the problems centred on them being unable to understand English sufficiently.</p>
<p>The hospital is struggling to employ middle grade, registrar-level doctors, and has on occasion to employ a locum doctor to cover a shift, Ms Ashley said.</p>
<p>While the application process for consultants involved their English and communication skills being tested with simulation of a meeting with a patient, Ms Ashley said she could not account for the English skills of locums, who work at the hospital on a temporary basis.</p>
<p>Helen Ashley said the hospital has been forced to rely on locums whose English isn&rsquo;t always up to standard</p>
<p>She added doctors from India and Pakistan had similar training to English doctors but due to changes to the NHS recruitment process and the drop in the value of the pound, many now prefer to go to work in countries such as Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Burton Hospitals Trust, Jim Morrison, said: &#8216;I don&rsquo;t want to sound racist, but some of the worst-speaking doctors that I have come across have been from Europe.</p>
<p>&#8216;They are free to travel in Europe and occasionally their communication of English can be absolutely awful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Local people in the town have also complained about the issue.</p>
<p>Chairman of East Staffordshire Borough Council&rsquo;s health sub-committee, Trevor Hathaway, told a meeting at Burton Town Hall: &#8216;A couple of weeks ago, a relative of mine met a consultant and he couldn&rsquo;t understand a word he was saying.</p>
<p>&#8216;Not only that, the nurse had to tell him what to write on the paperwork.&rsquo;  </p>
<p>Ms Ashley added: &#8216;That&rsquo;s not the first time I have heard that, or seen it in a complaint letter.</p>
<p>&#8216;We had one doctor there were two or three complaints about his language skills.</p>
<p>&#8216;He was hard to understand.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Who cares if they can&rsquo;t be understood? Think how diverse it is!</p>
<p>I know diversity = automatic improvement, because the creatures who run our society say so.</p>
<p>Diversity, diversity&hellip;I just can&rsquo;t get enough of it! I dream of the day when people drop their jobist prejudices and acknowledge that a janitor is just as likely to perform brain surgery successfully as a brain surgeon. And if they don&rsquo;t speak English, that&rsquo;s even better!</p>
<p>Confusion is clarity!<br>
War is peace!<br>
Ignorance is wisdom!<br>
Diversity is strength!</p>

		<p>You don&rsquo;t have to go to England to find a problem with understanding hospital personnel.  Several years ago I was a patient in Fairfax Hospital NOVA and I found it a challenge to decipher the &#8220;English&#8221; of the oriental nurses they employ.  </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see Amren is paying more attention to the displacement of whites by Asians in desirable professions instead of only focusing on black dysfunction.  </p>

		<p>It is probably good that this issue has at least been raised in a UK national newspaper.</p>
<p>We have the same problem here, fortunately our health system is still such that one can vote with one&rsquo;s feet, like go to a private hospital or go to a Dr of one&rsquo;s choice.</p>
<p>Can someone who knows a bit more about these things verify that a Dr trained in say, Pakistan, has the same level of skill &amp; training as an Australia or UK trained Dr. To me it seems highly  unlikely and if the patient and Dr can not communicate it is a very serious situation.</p>

		<p>I am a veteran of the US Army. I am seventy years old.</p>
<p>Last year, I went to the Veterans Administration in Pennsylvania for health care.</p>
<p>I was assigned to a muslim woman &#8220;doctor&#8221; in muslim garb. She was unable to understand English, so she would look at a computer screen where there was apparently &#8220;English&#8221;, phonetically spelled out so she could &#8220;speak English&#8221; to me. However, after a few minutes in her presence, it became obvious to me that she could not understand a word I said, and her responses to me were completely irrelevant to my statements.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I knew a psychiatrist at the facility who told me that I could request a different doctor, which I did. However, how many veterans are stuck with this asshole of a &#8220;doctor&#8221;, who will mis-diagnose almost every patient.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the US Army discharges competent doctors each year who would be able to relate to other veterans, and be able to at least speak English and communicate competently with other veterans.</p>
<p>Just my thoughs,<br>
Bill </p>

		<p>Strangely enough, before the establishment of the NHS in 1948, virtually all doctors in Britain were actually of British descent.<br>
  Obviously the influx of third world doctors into Britain is somehow linked with government policy, since the NHS is entirely state funded.</p>

		<p>Apart from their bad English, I would be very leery of physicians who were trained in India and Pakistan.  These countries are very corrupt and dysfunctional (especially Pakistan).  The education systems are also very corrupt and no doubt it is possible to get a medical degree by bribery.  I&rsquo;m sure some of these physicians are competent, but we don&rsquo;t have any way of knowing which ones.    </p>
<p>The same can be said of Russia and parts of Eastern Europe and anywhere from Mexico south.   But unfortunately in Canada we also have a lot of these foreign trained doctors.  </p>

<p>&gt; In india, as in much of the Commonwealth nations, the British medical school system is emulated and were often initiated by Brits.  Many Americans travel to India and Southeast Asia to receive surgeries because of the huge savings in cost and have long reported excellent results and very good care in general.  </p>
<p>Guessing that they must be lousy doctors because they are not white is not a valid criteria for criticism. The real problem is having so many doctors from other lands that creates not only a language barrier but causes all sorts of dysfunctions in the system, just as it does in society in general.  The impact in the hospital and in health care increases the probability of mistakes and contribute to an increase in mortality due to medical mistakes with a corresponding increase in malpractice lawsuits and insurance costs.  Diversity in health care delivery costs much more than containment in one system.</p>
<p>The few foreign trained MDs I have seen records from (I am retired) in cases where I was involved showed more thoughtfulness and accuracy than the many I have seen over 25 years by American doctors.  This is because American doctors have to be noncommittal in their language due to worries about malpractice accusations.  Foreign trained doctors also seem more ready to try different solutions, unrestricted by typical AMA hyped prejudices and preferences (promoted by for example, powerful pharmaceutical lobbies).</p>
<p>I worked in Slovenia with a Slovenian orthopedic surgeon for a couple years in the late 1990s.  Their medical school is the typical Russian style four year school.  But they have better outcomes than we do.  The U.S. is 37 in the world where health care delivery is concerned.  Young doctors go to work, but are apprenticed under more experienced doctors.  The doctors at a hospital have weekly conferences where they discuss the most serious cases together and arrive at solutions.  This provides every patient with multiple professional opinions and averts errors common to American doctors.  I had a good friend there who was diagnosed with a very serious cancer.  Three surgeries later, he still had some remnant.  So he was sent to Switzerland to have very expensive photon treatment.  He is cancer free today and is enjoying life with his second wife and two children to add to his other two grown up boys from a previous marriage.  He has been building a very nice home all through this, never having had to pay a penny (Euro) for his care.</p>
<p>What stood out to me from my experience in that country was that it was largely composed of one (Slovenian( ethnicity and everything was far simpler and therefore more efficient because as my friend used to say, &#8220;Here we are like one big family.&#8221;  However, their new membership in the EU is probably already affecting that.</p>
<p>We Americans need some serious sobering. </p>

		<p>I was assigned a chinese doc by my HMO a few years back.  I could not understand him, and he didn&rsquo;t seem to care if he was understood or not.  The fact that he mumbled, seemed incoherent at times and overly distracted made matters all the worse!</p>

		<p>I organise medical English courses at a chiropractic teaching college. Time and again we are made aware of the problem of doctors not understanding English sufficiently to be able to deal with patients. We have a right to understand what a doctor is telling us about our bodies. The UK government has been dragging its heels for too long over this and its time some decisions were taken instead of this awful inertia which means we will do nothing until people speak out and/or someone else dies. Why does the EU dictate what we can or cannot do in relation to the way we live? And why is it that incoming doctors from non EU countries are tested significantly on their language skills before they are allowed to practise? An Australian doctor has to pass an English language test to work in the UK but not one from Poland? Where is the logic in this? </p>

		<p>Nobody suggested Dr&rsquo;s were incompetent because they were not white. We either said we could not understand them or talked about the corruption, bribery, and lack of respect for science in the third world,especially in muslim countries. That was quite a leap you took. </p>
