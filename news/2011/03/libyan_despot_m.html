			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Corky Siemaszko, Daily News (New York), March 7, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Libyan leader Moammer Khadafy played the race card Monday, warning Europe that if he falls they will be deluged by hordes of illegal African immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are millions of blacks who could come to the Mediterranean to cross to France and Italy, and Libya plays a role in security in the Mediterranean,&#8221; he told the France 24 television station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Libya may become the Somalia of North Africa, of the Mediterranean,&#8221; Khadafy&rsquo;s son, Seif, added. &#8220;You will see the pirates in Sicily, in Crete, in Lampedusa. You will see millions of illegal immigrants. The terror will be next door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blaring bigotry came as Khadafy&rsquo;s forces drew a line in the sand around the despot&rsquo;s hometown of Surt and launched a fierce counter-attack against rebels trying to topple him.</p>

<p>Only if the Europeans let them get that close, Moammer.  </p>
<p>Somehow, though, I suspect that such a black tsunami would be even more than the limp-wristed European Soviet would be able to swallow without breaking up.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The blaring bigotry came as Khadafy&rsquo;s forces drew a line in the sand&hellip;&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Notice that &#8220;Corky Siemaszko,&#8221; author of this puff piece, considers it &#8220;blaring bigotry&#8221; that Khadafy describes blacks in truthful terms, but sees nothing wrong with presuming that Europeans will have no choice but to welcome them with open arms.</p>
<p>Excellent work,Comrade Siemaszko!<br>

		<p>This quote: &#8220;You will see millions of illegal immigrants. The terror will be next door.&#8221; - is described as &#8220;The blaring bigotry&#8221;: Although Col. Khadafy often sounds like a drug-crazed lunatic, it appears his son fully understands this particular situation.  Not that we need to take any efforts to keep the Khadafy&rsquo;s in power, but maybe we could give one of them a job as Secretary of Homeland Security and let him protect our Southern border&hellip; as it seems our current DHS leadership prefers not to want to do the job.</p>

<p>They doing exactly that right now.  Europe, like the US, is too cowardly to protect it&rsquo;s own territory and citizens.  It will be the people who finally drive out the invaders, right along with the cowardly, simple-minded, elitist dregs.</p>

<p>Baloney. Libya has become 1/4 sub-Saharan African under Khadafy. Without him they wouldn&rsquo;t have been in Libya to start with. He let them in and has been using them to extort money from Italy by threatening to let them immigrate illegally. With Khadafy gone the Libyans would deport all the sub-Saharans and the threat would be no more.</p>

		<p>Whether he goes down or not, Africans are going to swarm Europe.  Just like in America, whites are simply incapable of seeing the danger and do not have the courage to do anything about it if they do.<br>

		<p>&#8220;blaring bigotry&#8221; is hilarious! Try simple truth from the regime. The US and UN have no business getting involved in Libya. Regardless of the outcome in this country the government will be hostile to the US and western civilization.</p>

		<p>Said the one liberal socialist to his boyfriend, while sipping delicately at a soi latte` in San Francisco:  &#8220;So, have you had a democratic revolution in your country yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other tittered and poked his pinky out, the better to sip his own estrogen laced beverage more daintily&hellip;</p>
<p>Like it or not, mob revolution produces, not unity but poverty.  Not democracy but anarchy.  Strongmen are an easy (to replace) way to keep countries that are in no way ready for the 21st century from taking out entire regions with migratory genocide and population displacement.  As the poor seek wealth.  As the dispossessed seek shelter.  As the terrorist seeks a sheep herd to wolf walk into a new victim population with.</p>
<p>Which doesn&rsquo;t mean much, if Eurabia was up to the fight, it wouldn&rsquo;t take more than a week or two of 5&#8221; gun equipped destroyers blowing fishing boats out of an economic exclusion zone as territorial &#8216;interest&rsquo; around key mid-point islands to convey the necessary message: &#8220;We don&rsquo;t want you.  Slaughter yourselves to a Malthusian equilibrium.  We won&rsquo;t stop you so long as you only kill yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Italy alone could do this, if she wanted to.</p>
<p>The question is whether or not EU-rope still has the stones.  Or if they are entirely the willing victims of an Arabian &#8216;dialogue&rsquo; condition which has forever put them on their knees.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Khadafy, with respect sir, I quote a famous aviator of the 48th &#8216;Liberty&rsquo; TFW flying F-111Fs out of Lakenheath England in 1986: &#8220;How should we know it was the camel&rsquo;s turn to be on top?&#8221;</p>
<p>With Predators, such mistakes will be in-future easily avoided.</p>
<p>Khadafy is old, is warped in the mind and is in need of replacement.  Whether Libyans do this for themselves or simply sink lower into squallor is non of our business.  Only when they head North as opposed to East or West, does their fate matter.</p>

		<p>In a sane world this would be a hollow threat as the Europian nations would band together and send military forces to those borders with shoot to kill orders. It wouldn&rsquo;t take long for word to get out and that would be the end of this &#8220;swarm&#8221;. It should be treated as a foreign invasion - which it is!<br>

		<p>Just what is Mr. Khadafy implying here?  Would a swarm of sub-saharan Africans ruin Europe?  Everyone in the world will admit this, even European citizens, but not their government.</p>
<p>I have a solution.  If immigrants wash up on the beach, walk up to their boats and push them back into the sea and escort them a few miles out.  Of course my personal solution would involve more fatal measures to be taken, but this is a start.  DO NOT give them asylum or even jail time!  Europe&rsquo;s jails are probably nicer than their actual homes.  Do not give these criminals a paid-for vacation.</p>

<p>(Who does he think he is with his trying to scare us over illegal immigrants? He&rsquo;s been in power for 40 years. He should be able to come up with something better than that.)</p>

		<p>And that was the difference. When Reagan bombed Libya in &#8216;86, he did it as retaliation for a terrorist attack, ordered by Libya, that killed Americans. In that instance he used the U.S. military as it should be used - to protect and defend American interests. If Obama orders U.S. military involvement in Libya now, it will be to intervene in one side of what is basically a Libyan civil war - a war that we have no business and no interest in.</p>
<p>And for the poster who (several months ago) said he voted for Obama because he thought O would &#8220;stop the neocon wars,&#8221; how&rsquo;s that working out for you? O&rsquo;s keeping our boys (and girls) in Iraq &#8220;maybe just a little longer than planned. Just a little, honest!&#8221; More U.S. dead in Afghanistan in two years under Obama than in eight years under Bush. And now threats of intervention in Libya. Nice going, genius. Looks like that worked out about as well as &#8220;hope and change.&#8221; Not to mention the sheer hypocrisy of a self-proclaimed &#8220;white race loyalist&#8221; voting for a &#8220;hate whitey&#8221; black militant.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally have a long memory about that sort of thing, but an Amrener voting for Obama&hellip;that really got to me.</p>

		<p>I really wonder what Europe would do in response. The whole place has become so emasculated I wonder if anyone would really put up a fight. 50 men from the 12th century could probably conquer Europe. One longboat and you could take England.</p>

		<p>  As I remarked in a previous post on this site Gaddhafi is not as crazy as he makes out.Playing the race card and his derisive  remarks about Al Qaeda are purposely meant to show that if his regime is to fall we will see a virtual invasion of Europe by Africans and the possibility of an Islamic State or terrorists taking control of Libya,,,one can see a hint of a desperation creeping in amongst the rat cunning and brutal rule of this dictator&hellip;ala Madame Pompadour `After us The Deluge`  <br>
  Gaddafi likes to also use his Western educated fluent English speaking sons as the so called ` nice articulate` side of the regime.Also  interesting how one of them,Seif,is now also  warning of utter terror and chaos  in Libya and even this Somalia style piracy in the Mediterranean.<br>
  Yet The threat of a  massive African invasion of Europe  if Libya further crumbles is very real,North Africans and  Sub Saharan Africans.<br>
  The success and resurgence of the right wing parties as we<br>
are seeing right now in france with the National front may be crucial in at least trying to contain some of this human deluge for the time being. <br>

		<p>I must say, that is a convincing threat on the part of Mr.Gaddafi (or Ghadafi, or Kaddafi, or Khadafy or Qadafi, or whatever spelling they&rsquo;re using for his name). If the European leaders were rational, it might even be a smart move on his part.</p>
