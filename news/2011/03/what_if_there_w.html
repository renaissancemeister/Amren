<h1><a href="https://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/what-if-there-were-not-so-many-white-people/">What If There Weren&rsquo;t So Many White People?</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Christian Rudder, OkTrends, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip} Since most thinking about race hinges on the fact that one particular race predominates, what if, using statistical models, you could make that predominance disappear?</p>
<p>Right now, even on a per capita basis, whites gets more messages than non-whites on OkCupid:</p>
<p>But how much of this reflects whites&rsquo; &#8220;popularity&#8221; and how much reflects their population? What would this graph look like in a racially-balanced world? How would people&rsquo;s choices change, if the people to choose from weren&rsquo;t mostly of one race?</p>
<p>This post is based on 82 million messages sent on OkCupid over the last few months. Here&rsquo;s what we found.</p>
<p><b>Our data set</b></p>
<p>OkCupid is actually less white than the rest of the U.S. Internet, though it&rsquo;s hard to make direct group-to-group comparisons because Quantcast (our national demographic source) doesn&rsquo;t have multiracial data.</p>
<p>For this post, to keep the discussion streamlined and accurate, I&rsquo;ll only include OkCupid&rsquo;s largest single-race groups: whites, asians, blacks, and latinos.</p>
<p><b>Where To Start</b></p>
<p>When you look at the messages sent by each of our four biggest racial groups, it&rsquo;s actually kind of amazing how much white people are flooding the market. In raw terms, everybody, whites and non-whites alike, sends white people most of their messages. {snip}</p>
<p>The kind of messaging imbalance that currently exists has observable effects on how people think about race and dating. Search for &#8220;interracial couple&#8221; on a stock photo site: you&rsquo;ll find a rainbow of Asians, Latinos, Black, and Indians, all hanging out with their white significant others. {snip}<br>
But as we&rsquo;ve seen, in a scenario where people have an equal choice of messaging options, things are very different.</p>
<p>In other words, person for person:</p>
<p>Asians are the most desired racial group in the country. </p>
<p>Then Latinos. Then whites, sort of. As we&rsquo;re seeing it now, the data is being distorted: a huge part of the country is white, and white people mostly like to talk amongst themselves. Intentionally or not, minorities are left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, people prefer their own race</p>
<p>Given equal choice, every race strongly prefers itself:</p>
<p>And white people actually prefer themselves the least, but right now there&rsquo;s just so many of them. It&rsquo;s interesting to think what things would be like if the shoe was on the other foot; if another race outnumbered whites 19:1. {snip}</p>
<p>For white people, there are also some places where a relatively smaller population still sends a disproportionately high number of messages to themselves  &mdash;  aka the most racist towns in America. The white people in Greenville, MS, for instance, comprise only 59% of our user base there. However, 95% of their messages go to whites; that&rsquo;s 14× the expected rate.</p>
<p>Cities with the most white-loving white people</p>
<p>#1 Greenville, MS</p>
<p>#2 Jackson, MS</p>
<p>#3 Montgomery, AL</p>
<p>#4 Memphis, TN</p>
<p>#5 Atlanta, GA</p>
<p>The most segregated city north of the Mason-Dixon line is a surprising one: New York. White New Yorkers message other white New Yorkers at about 2× the national rate, probably about Animal Collective.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It seems that generally, people of all races write down to blacks and Latinos and up to Asians and whites. This is a pretty crazy result: proof that race not only affects the quantity of the contacts between people, but the quality as well. For example, the average black person writes at a level almost one full grade-level higher when writing to a white person than when writing to another black person.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because men write women. If women wrote men, we&rsquo;d expect blacks to be the most &#8220;desired&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>And white people actually prefer themselves the least, but right now there&rsquo;s just so many of them. It&rsquo;s interesting to think what things would be like if the shoe was on the other foot; if another race outnumbered whites 19:1.</i></p>
<p>Well, they could try looking at a South African dating site. But, given what happens in heavily-black Southern towns and New York City, I&rsquo;d expect the novelty to wear off.</p>

		<p>Oh MY&hellip;. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m from Greenville.  Took all my Parents&rsquo; money to send me to a private school.  Takes all of everybody&rsquo;s money to send their kids to private schools.  If you&rsquo;re too poor for that, you move to a white part of the country.  It&rsquo;s the kind of town where you can&rsquo;t leave anything outside without having it stolen. It&rsquo;s been that way since the Seventies.</p>
<p>I had cousins whose ceiling fans were stolen off the front porch, right on the city&rsquo;s grandest and busiest boulevard&hellip;in broad daylight&hellip;and the ceilings were twelve feet tall.  It would have taken a big ladder.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who had a fine house on the most chic and expensive road, in the best (and farthest outlying) part of town.  Took her YEARS to sell it.  At any price.</p>
<p>Had an uncle on the City Council.  Nothing but horror stories from him.  Most of the Council is Black.  City Government is now completely dysfunctional.</p>
<p>Greenville used to be the kind of place that got write-ups in Town &amp; Country.  Greenville&rsquo;s highest society were international players.  Greenville High led the nation in Latin.  It was one of the best high schools in America (before forced Integration).  The city was known for having many published authors.  It looked like Uptown New Orleans; with grand, tree-lined boulevards, and beautiful houses.  In fact, the king of New Orleans Uptown Society told his daughter, &#8220;When you go to Greenville, you go among the Aristocrats of the Earth.&#8221; (I quote from John M. Barry&rsquo;s book Rising Tide).  </p>
<p>Greenville was more like a place in Connecticut than a part of the South.  It was known for its sophistication, and for the reserved behavior of its populace.  Greenvillians looked upon the rest of Mississippi, in the way that Maggie in &#8216;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&rsquo; viewed &#8220;Sister Woman and the No-neck Monsters&#8221;. People had houses in Maine.  Greenville girls went to the best boarding schools.  At one point, there were as many Volvos per capita, as there were in Greenwich Connecticut or Marin County, California.  In other words, the city had a sizable intelligentsia.</p>
<p>But the Kennedy/Johnson &#8220;Great Society&#8221;, along with other government meddling, basically allowed Blacks to eventually destroy everything.  And they pretty-much have done so.  The downtown shops, once chic beyond belief, closed, when ALL the money anyone could spare was diverted to paying private school tuition.   Today, the city is not much. Headline news includes a Greenville &#8216;Mom&rsquo; who killed her toddler by baking him in the oven.  Guess what color? </p>
<p>Greenville&rsquo;s new stats are all about obesity, domestic violence, theft, lifestyle-related disease, illiteracy&hellip; The usual thing for an extremely black place.</p>
<p>Jackson-proper is even worse (mostly because it&rsquo;s bigger): run by Blacks&hellip;dysfunctional&hellip;dying&hellip;  I live in a white community on the outskirts.  So many of us are so happy to be surrounded by other whites again.  We all wonder if this is the last time such a thing will be possible.  Rather than jinx ourselves and our community, by putting down roots, we leave our boxes mostly packed from the last move&hellip;and the move before that&hellip; Each time, fleeing&hellip;</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve had your life thwarted, disrupted, stunted, over and over, by nonwhites, you have a tendency to appreciate whites.  And yes: you create a &#8216;Bubble of Whiteness&rsquo; to wrap yourself in, so that you may float safely in the surrounding Sea of Darkness.  For my Kids&rsquo; generation, it&rsquo;s second nature.  It has to be pointed out to them that they live in a carefully-maintained cocoon.  They have never known anything else.</p>
<p>Call us White-loving Racists if you need to, Christian Rudder.  Me, I&rsquo;m just trying to survive.</p>

		<p>This may or may not be off topic but it`s something I learned about dating sites.  One night at work I wrote a profile. Then I had a female customer write my profile again, pretending to be me. Her ad got about a dozen responses. Mine got none. Hmmmm&hellip;</p>

		<p>Yet in countries that are 99% East Asian like China, South Korea and Japan all plastic surgeries done are to make them look like white people or closer to it.  There are youtube videos of scores of East Asian celebrites with extensive plastic surgery to look white.</p>
<p>One big reason for these results are non-white people are explicitly told to date within their racial or ethnic group by their parents and/ or peers.  Most white people in America at least and I would guess anywhere are not told to stay inside their racial group and without a doubt not within their ethnic group.  Add to that the idea if a white person is not open to dating non-white people he or she is racist while non-white people who are not open are seen as being mindful of his or her racial heritage, of who made him or her.  The ultimate goal is to destroy white people particularly Northern European dispora.</p>
<p>Another smaller reason is obesity.  Obesity rates among white people are much higher than East Asians.  Obese people are less desirable to most people.</p>

<p>Woah, hold up.  Is the author seriously saying that whites who prefer whites are racist?  The rest of the study was interesting(nothing new there, but his &#8216;what if&rsquo; statistics leave out a lot of variables and ignore other data), but that&rsquo;s just insane.</p>

		<p>Lauren and Bigreddan,</p>
<p>Greetings from a fellow Deltan, albeit one from the area to the south of your home town. I thought I was the only one around here who paid enough attention to the issues to actually find a site like this. Usually, &#8220;our&#8221; people in this area tend to be politically apathetic, a redneck version of keeping it real. </p>
<p>I hate to see the downfall of Greenville, as well. It&rsquo;s a town that had a sort of spirit back in the day, one you could really feel. Now it seems alien to me. I almost never go there unless I need to get to Walmart (a place I loathe, so you can imagine how often that happens) as fast as possible. </p>
<p>Greenville isn&rsquo;t the only town in this side of the state experiencing an exodus. It&rsquo;s too bad, too, because I&rsquo;ve always felt that the Delta had a white population that was unlike any other in the world.</p>

		<p>It reminds me of a news story prior to the 2008 US presidential election showing how states with the largest percentage of blacks had white populations that were also the least likely to be excited about voting for a &#8220;historic&#8221; president. Familiarity with non-whites seems to breed contempt, or at the very least, distrust.    </p>

		<p>This whole thing is nonsense. This guy is just trying to repeat the modern myth story of &#8216;white people are bad and losers&rsquo; around a data set which is woefully incomplete at best. At the core of it, he&rsquo;s just trying to encourage miscegenation.</p>
<p>He shows blatant hypocrisy in his judgements, saying on one hand that all people tend to contact their own race more, then complains of racism for whites who do this. And when whites turn out to be the least &#8216;racist&rsquo; of groups, being willing to text out to others groups more often, he even chastises them as doing so for hating themselves instead of praising them for trying to be the least &#8216;racist&rsquo; group. Damned if you do, damned if you don&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>What kind of data set is this anyway? Is this representative of whites and other races at large in the population? Its just a subset of the group who used OkCupid during a short window of a few months. Not exactly an empirical finding that can be said to be representative of the races, is it? Is texting a measure of popularity, or simply a measure of who does it more? Maybe the more productive whites are less likely to waste time &#8216;tweeting&rsquo; all day as opposed to &#8216;vibrant&rsquo; people of color teen and 20-somethings one sees perpetually with a cell phone or Blackberry in hand texting away.</p>
<p>What are we to make of the steady downward trend of whites as age increases? Is this really less white popularity, or that fewer and fewer whites are represented among daters at these age groups, more likely to have already entered into stable relationships as they get older? That would suggest that the reverse is true, that whites are more popular, in fact, or better &#8216;catches&rsquo; for being more likely to have settled down. Also as people climb the success ladder at work to becoming managers, etc, how many of them have the time, or the desire to be seen chatting away on OkCupid?</p>
<p>The reality is that black women and Asian men are the ones having trouble finding dates, and that accelerates by the time one gets to be middle aged and older.</p>
