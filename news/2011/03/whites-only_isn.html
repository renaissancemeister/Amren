			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Editorial, Los Angeles Times, March 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Texas scholarship that excludes nonwhites betrays ignorance of the point of minority aid: an attempt to counter centuries of white privilege.</p>
<p>If there are scholarships and loan programs and government contracts set aside for blacks and Latinos, can there be similar set-asides for whites?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>We accept the organization&rsquo;s assurances that it is not motivated by racism. But we still find the idea of whites-only scholarships offensive (even if they are legal), and the organization&rsquo;s underlying understanding of race is even more so.</p>
<p>That understanding is sometimes called the &#8220;symmetrical view&#8221; of race. It holds that whites and minorities are similarly situated and that programs that exclusively benefit whites are as legitimate as those that serve minorities. {snip}</p>
<p>This symmetrical view ignores history. Scholarships and other arrangements that favor racial minorities are generally an attempt to counter the effects of centuries of white privilege. And despite what some people might believe, those effects haven&rsquo;t gone away. This country has done much to overcome its history of racism, but gaping disparities in education and wealth persist. Scholarships and other programs seeking to close those gaps naturally will focus on blacks and Latinos.</p>
<p>Many Americans cringe at the phrase &#8220;whites only,&#8221; and for good reason. Historically the exclusion of nonwhites was inextricably tied to notions of white supremacy. The time hasn&rsquo;t arrived when &#8220;whites only,&#8221; or any policy predicated on it, can be regarded as just another patch in the quilt of diversity.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t begrudge any young men scholarship aid from the Former Majority Assn. for Equality. But we wish the organization would offer its largesse on a nonracial basis.</p>

		<p>Has the UNCF given any scholarships to poor whites from Appalachia?  There is a historic inequality that needs to be addressed I think.  I sure wish the UNCF would offer it&rsquo;s largesse on a non-racial bias.</p>

		<p>The premise of this complaint is fraudulent.  In Europe, which is the indigenous land of whites, whites would naturally be in control.  In America, which was settled, and organized by Europeans would naturally see whites in control.  In Japan, Japanese have Japanese privilege, IN Chinda, IN India&hellip; etc.  (That Europeans went out into the world and spread civilization is a fact, and it could not have been done any other way).  The new Leftist idea is that it is NORMAL to flood a white nation with non-whites and then claim discrimination because you and &#8220;your people&#8221; are not the ones in control. </p>
<p> &#8220;Eyes on the Prize,&#8221; has always meant takeover, not equality.</p>
<p>We need to keep these social engineering Western Communists honest(Russia doesn&rsquo;t even want them).  They twist even their own arguments to suit their imperative of supplanting whites however they can.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time for private, white male only colleges.  It&rsquo;s time for a white only nation.</p>

<p>Of course that would mean that the Federal Non-Discrimination Laws would do the discriminating for them.  But really, if they think this group should just offer a NONRACIAL scholarship, why don&rsquo;t all of them do so?  And that box all the non-racists are always wanting applicants to check; why don&rsquo;t they just eliminate them and let&rsquo;s see how a truly color blind bureaucracy would serve a meritocracy.</p>

<p>&gt; I bet that Hispanics have Hispanic privilege south of the U.S. Border.  I bet that blacks have black privilege (such as it is) in Africa.  Anyway, no white man could ever hope to become president in Africa, Mexico, or any other non-white nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Historically the exclusion of nonwhites was inextricably tied to notions of white supremacy.&#8221; </p>
<p>The United States, once drained of its wealth in its past and future attempts to supplant whites in society, will look like Mexico, or any of the other filthy, near third world dungheaps  that are currently supplying America with its future &#8220;betters.&#8221;  They will then look about for the whites who have always supported them, but we will be gone, or at least out of their reach.</p>
<p>I say betters because this is a contest, make no mistake.  The one with the most self-serving as the winners. This has never been about equality.  That word is just one of their tools.</p>

<i>&#8220;We accept the organization&rsquo;s assurances that it is not motivated by racism. But we still find the idea of whites-only scholarships offensive (even if they are legal)&#8221;</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s the crux. &#8216;Though legal, we find white scholarships to be offensive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is what they want the publics reaction to be; offended by anything whites do.</p>
<p>Most liberal arguments follow the same agenda in trying to promote this &#8220;offensive&#8221; behavior by whites.</p>
<p>This article is a good sign, however. It shows that a) some whites are seeing a need and taking action, b) it brings the issue to a large pool of readers who will question why they should be offended, and c) it shows that the left is feeling the pressure to respond to these white scholarships.</p>
<p>Hopefully, white people reading this editorial will start asking, &#8220;Why should I or anyone be offended by a white scholarship when there are thousands for non-whites?&#8221;</p>
<p>Good job, LA Times, Good job.</p>

		<p>The Bill and Melina Gates schlorship program excludes CAUCASIANS TOTALLY but the minsteram media ignores it as do most of the talking heads on radio and television.  One of my white liberal friends said that &#8220;Bill Gates probably thinks that most white parents can afford to send their kids to college with their own money.&#8221; I&rsquo;ve written the Bill O&rsquo;Reilly show about bringing the Gates&rsquo; philosphy to his viewing audience but got no response from him.  I guess it doesn&rsquo;t matter though as white parents will continue to feed the war machine with their kids as cannon fodder.</p>

<p>Could the LA Times make it any clearer that it hates whites? </p>
<p>FTR, most, if not all of the MSM feel the same way about you if you are white and in no way should you support the propaganda media that hates you.  This includes FOX news.</p>
<p>If you live in the Los Angeles area you must immediately shun the LA Times and tell every white you know to boycott a medium that expects you to pay to be told it hates you.</p>
<p>Put &#8216;em out of business, white Los Angelenos&hellip;..that is if there are any whites left in California.</p>

		<p>The LA Times editorial fails to take into account that past racism cannot be used to grant Latinos special benefits, because they weren&rsquo;t in the country at the time of Jim Crow and the fact that we allowed them or their ancestors to immigrate here already indicates a generous gift given to them.  (At any rate, Latinos pre-1970 or so were considered white anyway.) Should a recent immigrant from South America immediately be given benefits over a white native-born American?  </p>
<p>Also, the LA Times falsely implies scholarships pit wealthy whites vs. poor minorities.  Not true  &mdash;  as someone mentioned earlier, the Bill and Melina Gates scholarship program, directed towards lower-income folk, expressly excludes whites while allowing every other ethnic group.  So poor whites  &mdash;  hardly the beneficiaries of past racism  &mdash;  are being unfairly excluded from scholarships.</p>
<p>If scholarships were strictly means-only based (which few Amren readers would complain about), whatever hardships minorities face would show in a greater-than-average allotment of scholarships to them.  No problem there.  But if pure race-based scholarships independent of financial situation are wrong as the LA Times claims, they should be wrong regardless of the races that benefit.  Disappointing to see the LA Times support this double standard, so yes, a boycott of them is well deserved.</p>

		<p>I find it difficult to believe that this story about the anti-White feelings expressed in this LA Times editorial has only received ten comments.  I would hope that more White males especially would be upset by their statements concerning trying to give scholarships to deserving White applicants.  We can see clearly that White poeple are under attack by the socalled &#8216;Elites&rsquo; in this country and now after the expose of NPR that&rsquo;s in the news, there is no mistake about it that these people like Bill Gates and others want to put the working class White people at the bottom and keep us there.  I would hope that the White population of this country wakes up before it is too late.</p>
