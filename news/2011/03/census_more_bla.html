<h1>Census: More Blacks in South Moving To Suburbs</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Atlanta Journal Constitution, March 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>African-Americans in the South are shunning city life for the suburbs at the highest levels in decades, rapidly integrating large metropolitan areas that were historically divided between inner-city blacks and suburban whites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this will shake up the politics,&#8221; said Lance deHaven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee. Because the South is a critical region for Republicans in presidential elections, &#8220;all the Democrats have to do is pick up a couple Southern states, and Republicans are in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>The share of blacks in large metropolitan areas who opted to live in the suburbs climbed to 58 percent in the South, compared to 41 percent for the rest of the U.S., according to census estimates. That&rsquo;s up from 52 percent in 2000 and represents the highest share of suburban blacks in the South since the Civil Rights Act passed in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The South also had major gains in neighborhood integration between blacks and whites. Thirty-two of the region&rsquo;s 38 largest metro areas made such gains since 2000, according to a commonly used demographic index. The measure, known as the segregation index, tracks the degree to which racial groups are evenly spread between neighborhoods. Topping the list were rapidly diversifying metros in central Florida, as well in Georgia, Texas and Tennessee.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s clear that black growth continues to locate in the suburban South, leading to declines in their historic segregation,&#8221; said William Frey, a demographer at Brookings Institution who did a broad analysis of the census data. &#8220;This new dispersed growth of blacks, coupled with the new waves of Hispanic growth, are changing the region&rsquo;s longstanding &#8216;black-white&rsquo; image and heralding the beginning of a more diverse region.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Good thing.<br>
I am pretty sure the guys who always protest against the Amren conferences are living in those areas. Let&rsquo;s see how long they will remain liberal after they have black neighbors and suddenly their sister can&rsquo;t get out at night.</p>

		<p>Of course they&rsquo;re moving to the suburbs to get away from the high crime cites, all while the Ethiopian Muslims are moving to rural America and the progressive white people are still buying downtown warehouse space to convert to lofts.</p>

		<p>The urban areas of Atlanta are so notoriously dangerous that anyone and everyone who can gets the heck outta Dodge; but a significant portion of these statistics is the result of demolishing public housing projects and spreading the black welfare thug population out amongst the white (and formerly safer) neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>I moved to Paulding County Georgia in 1996 thinking that this was a &#8220;safe place.&#8221; For a few years it was great - no crime, no loud music, and no blacks. In the last few years there has been an increase of blacks. Guess what? The crime has escalated and I&rsquo;m constantly going out on my porch every time there is a &#8220;disturbance!&#8221; Why in heck should there be disturbances in my neighborhood? For years everything was quiet; then, the blacks moved in and there are &#8220;disturbances!&#8221; My wife and I have put our home up for sale (knowing that we will loose money)and we are getting out of here! What a shame! We considered our house our &#8220;home place.&#8221; My only fear is that &#8220;where we go - they will follow!&#8221;</p>

		<p>This article makes no mention of the most common vehicle for this; subsidized housing.  In Atlanta they have closed and torn down most of the government housing projects and moved those residents to the suburbs under section 8 subsidies.  Blacks aren&rsquo;t &#8220;choosing&#8221; to move to the suburbs so much as they are being pushed out.  In the case of Atlanta it is to make room for more gays and wealthy whites.  I&rsquo;m positive the next Atlanta mayor will be white and the long rein of black &#8220;leadership&#8221; will be coming to an end.  Atlanta is not the only city doing this either.  Naturally whites in the suburbs have no say in this as even predominantly white suburbs are overrun by the hoards.  Katrina gave the process a major boost as well.  In Georgia&rsquo;s smallest county, Douglass, the black population has doubled in less than 10 years to nearly 40%.  The only whites who are immune live in a gated community at the very south end of the county.  The rest have been left to tough it out as blacks are moved into foreclosed homes in what used to be nice neighborhoods.  I have family trapped there by their mortgages and their sense of doing what&rsquo;s right by NOT walking away from their mortgage.  <br>

		<p>Dave, come to Frankfort IL, virtually no blacks here, or minorities for that matter. It&rsquo;s like living in the 70&rsquo;s. Go on their website and check the demographics of our city. It&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s an invisible force field protecting us from minorities. For whatever reason, blacks don&rsquo;t cross the town boundary which is Harlem Av. Don&rsquo;t even have to shop with them, the stores are filled with all whites. I think the census reported less than 1% non-white population here in Frankfort. The town is primarily conservative based on voting patterns.</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s no secret what&rsquo;s happening.  My neighborhood has fallen victim to the Fed&rsquo;s poverty dispersement scheme known as Section 8.  It&rsquo;ll be downright impossible to sell our house when the time comes to evacuate.  This is how suburbs are &#8220;diversified.&#8221;   </p>

<p>That is the reason why I will never buy a house.<br>
The politics even support none-whites moving into white areas. If they wouldn&rsquo;t do that, on every map even morons could see that the crime rate is totally a race problem. By spreading out they try to make crime looking more like a common problem.</p>
<p>Today you buy a house for 500.000$ and if after only one year you have two black neighbors, the value can sink to 100.000$. In such a changing world, in such a &#8220;diverse&#8221; world the biggest financial mistake you can do is to invest in immovables.</p>
<p>A girlfriend of my is living in a very small village with nice upper middle class people. The state put a social housing project in this little village and now there are maybe 10 tramps.<br>
Pretty sure they value of the houses around have lost more than dozens of thousands of their original values.</p>

		<p>The South is still majority white.  If blacks disperse themselves into white suburbs, they&rsquo;ll lose the bloc votes that put black mayors and Congressmen into office.  <br>
Liberals are always making these toothless threats about blacks taking over by their numbers, when they continue to comprise less than 13% of the population, abort half their babies, and often only bother to vote when black candidates are on the ballot.</p>

<p>Why are you still in Georgia? Thomas Chittum, in His book, CIVIL WAR II, predicts that Georgia and the Deep South will eventually become one black nation and that whites there will be dispossessed. You had better get out now before you lose everything.</p>
<p>Blacks are being driven out of California by Hispanics, and the blacks are primarily relocating to the Atlanta area. Blacks are also moving south from northern states. After Hispanics declare much of the Southwest a region of Mexico, this will be the catalyst for blacks deciding to declare the Deep South to be New Africa.</p>

Living in the American south is the absolute worst place to go, or remain, if one wishes to avoid blacks.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just too dang many of them down here and virtually no way to keep em&rsquo; out of your backyard. About the only sub- region down here where you can achieve avoidance is rural Appalachia or Ozarks. The second way are exclusive gated subdivisions. Unfortunately though, if you go this second route, your just a fort situated in hostile indian country and you won&rsquo;t get a calvary escort either.</p>
<p>Non- urban living north of the Potomac and Ohio Rivers is &#8220;by far&#8221; your best option to achieve &#8220;avoidance&#8221; in 2011.</p>

		<p>To Russ (#10): I&rsquo;ve also read CW2 (it&rsquo;s available free for download <a href="/misc/CWII.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and IMHO Chittum is wrong on that prediction. Not his fault, but in 1995 he could not have foreseen the re-arming of white America as a result of Obama&rsquo;s election. That means we have the blacks outgunned by a wide margin, which will more than negate any numerical advantage blacks might have in the future. He also apparently failed to notice that blacks are utterly incapable of forming any kind of stable or coherent government. (One look at Detroit, Haiti or Zimbabwe should make that point obvious.) So any &#8220;New Africa&#8221; they might proclaim would quickly collapse into chaos and anarchy, allowing whites to move back in and sweep them away like so much sand from a tile floor.</p>
<p>I do, however, agree with Chittum&rsquo;s prediction that the military will fracture along racial lines. That will also accrue to our advantage. Thanks to the affirmative-action and diversity lunacies, the majority of black officers and senior NCOs are incompetent slot-fillers, while the lower ranks are poorly trained, undisciplined and relegated to clerical and other &#8220;way in the rear&#8221; jobs. Meanwhile, as a recent article (and photo) here on AR showed, the elite soldiers are almost all white. Result: the black factions would be annihilated.</p>

<p>From what I gathered when I read the book, Chittum seemed to think it was at least as likely that blacks would not be able to hold any territory at all and would be completely extirpated. Remember, Hispanics have the benefit of scores of millions of reinforcements just to the south; blacks don&rsquo;t. </p>

<p>Yes true there are more and more blacks in Georgia but at the same time the Whites are increasingly race aware and heavily armed.  I moved out here 15 years ago from the west coast and love it, I am now nestled into a small white town in middle Georgia and I pray it stays this way. Unfortunately the closest city, Macon, is getting worse and worse and this community was set up as a white bedroom offshoot.</p>
