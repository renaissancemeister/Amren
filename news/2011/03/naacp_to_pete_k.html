			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Greg Sargent, Washington Post, March 9, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is weighing in for the first time on Pete King&rsquo;s hearings into the radicalization of Muslims, arguing that King&rsquo;s plans {snip} risk stereotyping Muslims in a manner historically endured by African Americans.</p>
<p>In a letter to King that was not distributed widely to the press, the NAACP invokes the assassination of civil rights figures, and specifically invokes discrimination against blacks as a forerunner to what King is doing:</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The invocation of American domestic terrorism, and the comparison of King&rsquo;s efforts to discrimination visited on African Americans, amount to a double-barreled shot at the very premise of his hearings, which is that the threat of Islamic terror is unique enough to justify the focus of high-profile Congressional hearings on just this one group of Americans. {snip}<br>

<p>The Honorable Peter King<br>
Chairman<br>
Committee on Homeland Security<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
Washington, DC 20515</p>
<p>The Honorable Bennie Thompson<br>
Ranking Member Committee on Homeland Security<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
Washington, DC 20515</p>
<p>Dear Chairman King and Ranking Member Thompson:</p>
<p>On behalf of the NAACP, our nation&rsquo;s oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots civil rights organization, I am writing to strongly urge you to reconsider holding the narrowly focused and reckless hearings planned by the Committee on Homeland Security, tentatively scheduled for March 10, 2011, on the &#8220;Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that Community&rsquo;s Response.&#8221; Such a hearing, as presently planned with it&rsquo;s limited and skewed focus on one religious- ethnic group, would be not only counter-productive as it clearly does not provide a focus on so many of the other &#8220;homegrown terrorist&#8221; groups working to radicalize sectors of U.S. religious communities, but it is also divisive and potentially harmful to our nation&rsquo;s security interests.</p>
<p>The NAACP is no stranger to domestic terrorism: as the surviving friends and family of Harry T. and Henrietta Moore, Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Jr., Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney, and Emmitt Till, not to mention the 168 killed and 450 injured in the Alfred T. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, and too many others can attest, we are all too familiar with the evil concept. We are also too familiar with the process of being ostracized and demonized because of who we are or what we look like. Finally, members of the NAACP also have a long history of working with and benefitting from the goodwill of people of all races and ethnicities regardless of their background. It is clear that the most effective means of identifying terrorists is through their behavior  &mdash;  not ethnicity, race or religion.</p>
<p>Factual history has clearly demonstrated that &#8220;homegrown domestic terrorism&#8221; cannot be relegated to one racial or ethnic group. To do so is to overlook actual historic and current events, which are both riddled with terrorist acts by extremists from a large variety of racial, ethnic, political, social and religious groups. Furthermore, by identifying one group as being largely responsible for current terror threats against our nation, you are promoting misinformation and stereotypes that can only build mistrust among members of that group. This in turn will make it more difficult for members of that group to cooperate with authorities in identifying or reporting genuine threats, and more unlikely that they will. On the other side of the equation, this approach creates misguided hostility towards or Muslims or perceived Muslims by perpetuating stereotypes which incite further misunderstandings or even violence against those groups.</p>
<p>So I must again urge you in the strongest terms possible to rethink the focus of your proposed hearings on domestic terrorism. The United States today clearly faces a wide variety of dangers, from both foreign and domestic sources, and to focus on one group presents not only a disservice to that group, but also to our Nation. I look forward to working with you in the upcoming Congress to help identify and eradicate threats against our Nation. Please feel free to contact me whenever you feel that the NAACP can be of assistance.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Hilary O. Shelton Director,<br>
NAACP Washington Bureau &amp; Senior Vice President for Advocacy and Policy</p>

		<p>Sorry NAACP..every time you open your mouth your Low IQ<br>
hustler mentality comes out..nothing that you have ever<br>
said or done has shown that racial stereotypes werent<br>
by and large accurate. Even more dangerous than your group<br>
is Islam. And just as with blacks the &#8220;stereotypes&#8221; are based<br>
on observation and painful experience. Differnce is <br>
black criminality is a largely a individual chaotic thing,<br>
Islamic psychopathology is organized, focused and fueled<br>
by the express commandments of Islam </p>

		<p>The hysterical reactions coming from Moslems and their liberal lapdogs really make it sound like they have something to hide!  If Congress decided to investigate Hindu or Sikh terrorism in America, does anyone think either group would turn handsprings trying to prevent such an action?  Everyone would likely yawn and scratch his head, as there would be little, if anything, to investigate.  The Moslems appear so fearful of investigation that Rep. Keith Ellison was apparently dispatched to put on an uncannily poor performance of crocodile tears and slavish whining.  The left appears ready for a meltdown.</p>

		<p>Can we still stereotype copperhead snakes?<br>
do I have to observe a mosquito to know it&rsquo;s intentions before I swat it?<br>
Can a single DUI or only one murder be so rare that now we find out that we have been overprosecuting these anomalies?<br>
Isn&rsquo;t every day a new day and today is the first day of the rest of our lives?  <br>
The fact that the naacp is even listened to, points to the insanity that is in our faces, in this country.  No wonder that the rest of world laughs at our gullibility and stupidity, but it isn&rsquo;t funny.</p>

Blacks have been all over this one comparing &#8216;targeting&rsquo; Muslims to racial discrimination against blacks before the civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Blacks are siding with Muslims for the same reason they side with Hispanics; they&rsquo;re hoping to build a non-white coalition that will take down the white man.<br>

		<p>Islam is a religion, not a race. Or more truthfully, a form of political imperialism disguised as a religion. </p>
<p>More than any other group known to man or woman, Muslims are responsible for bombings, attempted bombings, plans for bombings,beheadings, hijackings,&rsquo;honor killings&rsquo;,the hanging of homosexuals, the burnings of churches, temples, and synagogues and the people in them, the persecution and murder of Jews, Christians, Buhddists, Hindus,agnostics, atheists, and anybody else that Muslims are offended by and disagree with. </p>

		<p>I&rsquo;ll make a prediction. The most obvious questions that can be asked about the topic of these hearings will not be asked by the &#8220;Patriots&#8221; who convened the hearing. A question that should be obvious to anyone with a functioning common sense faculty of the human brain.</p>
<p>The very obvious questions:What made the death and destruction on 9/11 possible in the first place..and who voted for a particular policy that made 9/11 a certainty?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make another prediction also. During this congrssional hearing, there will be great praise for the rapidly expanding Muslim &#8220;American&#8221; population&hellip;America couldn&rsquo;t survive without them..and this praise will come from the American &#8220;Patriots&#8221; who convened this hearing&hellip;you can just see it comming:Muslim &#8220;Americans&#8221; are crucial for fighting the war on terror.</p>
<p>You see, if these two most obvious questions are asked, a massive level of mendacity and treason would be exposed&hellip;there would be no going back.</p>
<p>So here is my question:Why aren&rsquo;t Peter Brimelow and Brenda Walker-two experts in the Patriotioc Immigration Refrom Movement-asking thes two obvious questions?</p>
<p>The two most obvious questions that should be asked:Would 9/11 have occured if there was a national origins immigration policy  in place since 1965 that completed excluded Muslims? Second question:Who voted to allow the Muslims-a young high fertility legal immigrant group whose members include lots of very angry young high fertility Muslim Men-to come into America and expand very rapidly thereby making the death and destruction on 9/11 a complete certainty. I bet you numbersusa.com has the information that would expose the massive level of mendacity and treason that underlies the convening of this hearing on &#8220;American&#8221; Mulsim terrorist cells. Why isn&rsquo;t vdare.com asking these two very obvious questions about this hearing.</p>

		<p>- as it clearly does not provide a focus on so many of the other &ldquo;homegrown terrorist&rdquo; groups working to radicalize sectors of U.S. religious communities,</p>
<p>So tell me Ms. Shelton, could you list all these MANY other groups for us please and detail their terrorist activities?</p>
<p>The NAACP is no stranger to domestic terrorism: as the surviving friends and family of Harry T. and Henrietta Moore, Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, Jr., Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney, and Emmitt Till, not to mention the 168 killed and 450 injured in the Alfred T. Murrah building in Oklahoma City, and too many others can attest, we are all too familiar with the evil concept-</p>
<p>Oh God here we go again, bringing up crimes committed against blacks from 50 YEARS AGO and the one lone bombing by a White guy! Is THAT all they&rsquo;ve got? I see they didn&rsquo;t feel the need to bring up the victims of 9\11 and the THOUSANDS of people killed by ONLY muslims in RECENT history.</p>
<p>Finally, members of the NAACP also have a long history of working with and benefitting from the goodwill of people of all races and ethnicities regardless of their background.</p>
<p>No Ms. Shelton, the NAACP doesn&rsquo;t have a long history of &#8220;working&#8221; with ANYBODY, but they definately have a long history of &#8220;benefitting&#8221; from others goodwill.</p>
<p>The United States today clearly faces a wide variety of dangers, from both foreign and domestic sources,-</p>
<p>Yes and the NAACP being one of those domestic sources!</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you in the upcoming Congress to help identify and eradicate threats against our Nation.</p>
<p>In a sane world the NAACP would be told that the upcoming Congress has no desire to legitimize their organization by working with them, and that in fact they themselves will be next in line to be investigated.    </p>

		<p>7 Jupiter:  I was thinking about you when I watched a tiny bit of the hearings this afternoon.   The general tone of the hearings, at least on this the first day, was that &#8220;most Muslims are alright&#8221; but &#8220;we gotta do something about the radical fringe making life hell for the rest of them.&#8221;  My reaction in my own mind sounded so much like your usual admonitions that I think I should start paying you copyright royalties.  Obviously, the fundamental point is this:  I really don&rsquo;t care if even of one non-white Muslim legal immigrant was/is/will ever engage in terrorism.  Terrorism, while terrifying, is a red herring in the larger scheme of things.  All I care about is that us the native born white American majority aren&rsquo;t dispossessed by all these &#8220;good, non-terrorist&#8221; post-1965 non-white Muslims (and others.)</p>
<p>8 Tom S.:  The NAACP&rsquo;s interest in OKC is that the Murrah Federal Building was full of Federal workers.  And in an even semi-major city like Oklahoma City that has a sizable black population, and knowing the kind of people our Yankee government likes to hire, you can add two and two together to make the obvious four.  Black women were a majority of those killed and injured inside Murrah.</p>

		<p> As is its wont, the NAACP gins up all the cherished hobgoblins   &mdash;   &#8220;persecution&#8221; of blacks for &#8220;who we are,&#8221; &#8220;scapegoating&#8221; of Muslims (Why, just look at how many hundreds of Scandinavian Lutherans from Minnesota have set off terrorist bombs in this country!), and the piece de resistance, a revival of McCarthyism!</p>
<p> All this makes for good entertainment if you&rsquo;re having a dull, boring evening, but it&rsquo;s just an attempt to change the subject, and to mis-direct the audience&rsquo;s eyes while the magician cleverly palms the cards. Muslims are the ones mounting terrorist attacks, almost exclusively; Rep. King is right to hold these hearings; more power to him! </p>

		<p>I find it curious that the most vociferous objections to this hearing come from mainly blacks.  You don&rsquo;t suppose it has ANYTHING to do with the Nation of Islam adherents, radical muslims and dyed in the wool white hating and America hating BLACK muslims, being entirely black as an organization, do you?  What ties might there be between NOI and NAACP and radical muslims, I wonder?  As others have said&hellip;.what do they have to hide?  Here&rsquo;s a hint:  right after 9/11 the entire Congress and Senate stood on the steps of the Capitol and declared their &#8220;unity&#8221;.  And after the declaration, most of those present began singing God Bless America.  Hillary Clinton, many Democrats, and all of the Black Caucus left and refused to sing.  You could see it on the MSM tape.  They just left rather than sing a song asking God to bless America in the aftermath of the most horrendous terrorist attack on this country then, or now.  A pretty telling event when one contrasts the American blacks and their liberal plantation masters at that moment with White England standing firm together during the Blitz.  Eh?</p>

<p>When you begin an argument for why you are doing hearings by reaffirming the cliche, you sound defenseless and have already lost.  In fact, both King and Hannity spent more time going after the Democrats instead of Muslims, considering it is the &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslims around who sit silently and do nothing when their fellow religionists strap bombs to themselves and blow up other peaceful co-religionists.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call this for what it is, smoke and mirrors.  Neither man is serious enough to call for an outright ban on Muslim immigration, because to do so would take guts.  Of course, the only way to prevent Muslims from trying to kill us is by keeping them out of the country.  But no one points out the obvious (except Michael Savage) because that would be against the nation&rsquo;s dogmatic belief in &#8220;multiculturalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily, we have much better luck than Europe.  When Europe falls, maybe America will wake up.  Hopefully it won&rsquo;t be too late.</p>

<p>The exact same immigration policy that allowed your beloved Hindu and Sikh &#8220;Americans&#8221; to come in and steal jobs and other resources from  White Americans is the same one that allowed a cabal of young Muslim men to enter America and crash aircraft into the Twin Towers,the Pentagon and into the ground in rural Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Your post confirms my worst fears aready that this congressional hearing will end enthusiastically endorsing the continuation with the race-replacing post-1965 immigration policy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll make another prediction about what will come out of these congressional hearings. There will be a comparison made between the 9/11 Muslim  terrorist and the harmless Militia Movement&hellip;expect more goverment harrasment against law abiding White Americans in the Militia Movement&hellip;and from there, a direct line to police state  repression of   White Americans who are publicly opposed to the importation of Muslim legal immigrants and other post-1965 nonwhites.</p>
<p>Since 9/11 the Muslim &#8220;American&#8221; population has increased by a at least a million-probably higher if you include births to  Muslim immigrant couples. Nothing has changed. The exact same immigration policy that made 9/11 possible continues. And I want to know who voted for this. The answer to this question exposes the massive deception and treason that underlies this congressional hearing. </p>
<p>The NAACP and the &#8220;Patriots&#8221; convening this congressional hearing both agree-enthusiastically-that legal Muslim immigration must continue apace, thereby making race-replacememt and another 9/11 a complete certainty. </p>
<p>This hearing and the politician holding this hearing are not the least bit serious about protecting White Americans against another terrorist attack.</p>

<p>We have wasted our country on the undeserving and the unqualified.  And more to come&hellip;</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s just another way for liberals and racist blacks to keep whites in line.  They like to invent &#8216;white racism&rsquo; to keep money and sympathy rolling in for them.  Never forget that.</p>

		<p>Guys like Pete King are completely unnecessary for the stereotyping of Muslims; they stereotype themselves every day via their own behavior.</p>
<p>Anyone who disagrees is free to name other entire religions who call for the beheading deaths of everyone who disagrees with them, this disagreement cruelly causing them to pretend to be &#8220;offended&#8221;.  I can&rsquo;t think of any.</p>

		<p>For the people who oppose hearings for the Radical Muslim problem in America, I ask you, do nothing, just wait for the next American-hater to kill innocent people? Then what? Just wait for the next mass murder attempt by a misguided radical muslim? I believe people should watch the tape from a few weeks ago, the Imam/Hannity confession where &#8220;Sharia Law is coming to America and Americans&rsquo; are afraid of it&#8221; Think for yourself!!!</p>
