			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Sinclair Skinner, Washington Post, March 18, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Vincent Gray should resign. His involvement in nepotism and financial mismanagement is inexcusable and an embarrassment to the District of Columbia. And his administration duped voters with a plan to bully Adrian Fenty from office in what I believe was a corrupt campaign that violated election law.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Mayor Gray is not who he claimed to be on the campaign trail. He said he was a man of integrity who would end cronyism, but he has doled out $100,000 jobs to the children of high-ranking members of his administration. He has hired campaign staff members for city jobs at exorbitant wages that ignore lawful salary limits. With money from a city facing a budget crisis, he leased a car that cost almost $2,000 a month. And as the District&rsquo;s shifting demographics and struggling school system cloud its future, his leadership has made Washington a laughingstock.</p>
<p>Now, with Congress investigating Sulaimon Brown&rsquo;s claims that he was paid and promised a city job to impugn Adrian during the 2010 mayoral race, D.C. must brace for what could be the greatest political embarrassment since Mayor Barry&rsquo;s arrest in a 1990 drug sting. A cadre of federal investigators will descend on Washington as the GOP-controlled House begins a campaign to disenfranchise the District under a control board. As Republicans take over our Democratic city, already slim hopes of home rule will prove even more elusive, and last year&rsquo;s bitter debate over Michelle Rhee&rsquo;s personality will seem like a picnic.<br>

<p>Actually, DC&rsquo;s &#8220;shifting demographics&#8221; are what might save it, or at least spare it becoming Baltimore, or worse, Detroit.  DC is becoming more white and affluent.  The election of Vincent Gray was one of, if not the, last gasps of degenerate black DC.  </p>

		<p>Move along folks, nothing new to see here. Just another episode<br>
in black politics in America. Washington has gone through its Marion<br>
Barrys and Sharon Pratt Kellys, and now Vincent Gray. Same pattern always.. the blacks congenital inability to comprehend politics<br>
as anything but opportunity to steal, award self esteem boosting job titles and salaries to cronies. Armani suits and Rolex watches for all. The only<br>
halfway honest man was Anthony Williams and he was put in place<br>
by the whites in Congress after Barry was ejected. Then<br>
came Adrian Fenty who made the fatal mistake of bringing in <br>
the efficient Asian Michelle Rhee to fix the DC schools.<br>
They were both run out of town. Accountability..and measurable performance..the two unacceptable things in the black<br>
world. What could Fenty have been thinking?<br>
Well now we are back to normal. Vincent Gray with his felon cronies, bribes, and missing funds  has the blacks breathing a sigh of relief. We have gotten back to our roots. Praise Jesus.</p>

The real sin committed by Mr. Fenty appears to be that his excesses might expose blacks to criticism and ultimately cause blacks to lose power.</p>

		<p>A typical black mayor, huh?  Fenty wasn&rsquo;t black enough for Washingtonian blacks, so they&rsquo;re back to exactly what they want.</p>

		<p>Like Adrian Fenty was some great prize.  He handed over control of the D.C. schools to his life-in girlfriend, who then proceeded to import as many H-1B Asian teachers as she could.  Now she&rsquo;s living in with the Mayor of Sacramento, a former &#8220;baller,&#8221; and she&rsquo;s probably looking to do the same there.</p>

		<p>Some posters here, make it sound like D.C.&rsquo;s ex-mayor Adrian Fenty was a great statesman. Not true. He literally cried on the steps of SCOTUS, after the Court struck down D.C.&rsquo;s handgun ban, in the Heller decision. He and his minions in the city council dragged their feet to lift the ban, and they passed new laws making it tougher to buy, keep and bear arms - similar to what Daley did in Chicago, after SCOTUS struck down Chicago&rsquo;s ban in the McDonald decision. He even trashed a bill - on the advice of the Brady Bunch - that would have given the district&rsquo;s residents a measure of home-rule, if their Second Amendment rights were fully restored. Rather than accept the fact that the district&rsquo;s residents could exercise their constitutional rights under the Second Amendment, Fenty did not support the bill.</p>
<p>Fenty did little to fight crime in D.C., even suggesting via his police chief, that the National Guard patrol the city&rsquo;s streets, and promulgate a curfew. This was an admission that his police force - other than protecting himself - was not up to the job.</p>
<p>Fenty was more like Mugabe than he was George Washington.</p>

		<p>What is it with you people! Why is a corrupt black politician more abominable than your average white corrupt big city white politician.<br>
How is it that this shady black mayor is a reflection on all black politicians, and somebody like Chicago&rsquo;s Richard Daley is not a reflection on all white or Irish/Catholic mayors?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet you any money that Richard Daley and the Irish/Catholics that control the state house in Illinois, are more corrupt than this black mayor in D.C.! I&rsquo;ll bet you he is no more corrupt than the politicians that control NYC or the New York state government, or New Jersey - for that matter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he probably aspires to be just as corrupt and just as powerful as they are, he just hasn&rsquo;t achieved his goal yet. Because American politics seems to attract the most narcissistic, most duplicitous, most larcenous crew of crooks and downright criminals from among our citizenry, it is ludicrous for whites who comment on this thread to try and paint black politicians with a more heinous brush. They all belong to the same club, they all work with one another, therefore they who are corrupt are all brothers under the skin!<br>

		<p>Average African America</p>
<p> Daley may be corrupt..but he runs a heavily black city..and he <br>
has adopted to the ethics and norms of a heavily black city.<br>
And the more he adapted the more Daley became part of the problem<br>
Furthermore the black Mayors of DC were elected BECAUSE they were<br>
corrupt. The blacks loved Marion Barry BECAUSE he smoked crack.<br>
He was &#8221; a man of the people&#8221; you see.<br>
Michelle Rhee was run out of town BECAUSE she tried to improve things.<br>
It is racial&hellip;if you want to compare blacks to whites..compare<br>
a white mayor running a white city. Spokane Washington, or<br>
Twin Falls Idaho &hellip;then look for black style urban corruption.<br>
You wont find it.</p>
