<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->

<p>A Yale University study found that women who&rsquo;ve reported high levels of discrimination have more visceral fat, a type of fat that lies deep and surrounds abdominal organs.</p>
<p>Unlike the kind of fat that manifests in rolls and flaps, visceral fat can accumulate without people realizing it. Even skinny people can have unhealthy amounts of visceral fat wrapping their organs. This type of fat has been linked to heart disease, diabetes and other major health problems.</p>
<p>A study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology examined 402 African-American and white women in the Chicago area. They were asked whether they had been discriminated against based on their sex, age, race and other issues over the last year. This included insults about intelligence, subtle slights, mistreatment in restaurants or stores and harassment.</p>
<p>Researchers did not ask about weight discrimination, because they didn&rsquo;t want it to bias the results.</p>
<p>Then, the women&rsquo;s abdominal fat was measured in tomography scans.</p>
<p>Yale researchers found that women who reported more discrimination carried more visceral fat.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s widely believed that overweight people are discriminated based on their hefty size. But author Ten√© Lewis said, &#8220;We didn&rsquo;t find an association with the fat you see  &mdash;  the subcutaneous fat hanging over people&rsquo;s belt. It&rsquo;s the fat that&rsquo;s not visible to the naked eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her study suggests that discrimination could contribute to increased internal fat. {snip}</p>
<p>But one of their hypotheses is that the body releases a hormone called cortisol under stress. That hormone is believed to spur the accumulation of visceral fat.</p>
<p>Lewis did not find a difference between whites and African Americans in terms of health and discrimination.</p>

		<p>Given that virtually ALL Black, urban woman appear to be overweight to morbidly obese, it isn&rsquo;t exactly hard to figure out the motivation beind this transparently ridiculous excuse-making! Is there NOTHING Blacks are willing to take honest responsibility for?</p>

		<p>Fat discrimination? Please?  Ah, the Left and other people with an agenda just look for anything to make the West look evil and cruel, don&rsquo;t they?  Poor fat people.  They just can&rsquo;t help being out of shape and overeating and not getting regular exercise.  It&rsquo;s just another way for the thin man to keep a fat man down.</p>

		<p>My problem with this article is the choice of the word &#8216;Discrimination&rsquo;.  &#8216;Stress&rsquo;, &#8216;Unkindness&rsquo;, or &#8216;Depression caused by negative social interactions&rsquo; would all be better to describe the social component of Visceral Fat Gain.  </p>
<p>It has been known for millennia, that being unhappy can make us ugly.  </p>
<p>We know that bullied boys grow up smaller, less muscular, and possibly less smart.  We know that bullied/abused girls end up chubby.  And fat gain is one result of stress.  </p>
<p>Excessive Cortisol is harmful.  That&rsquo;s why we should limit our workouts to an hour&rsquo;s duration (I do weights in the morning, and Cardio later in the day), in order to avoid excessive production of Cortisol.  One reason some bodybuilders get big stomachs is that Cortisol from their long lifting sessions has given them the Visceral Fat that is described here.</p>
<p>However, choosing to frame the results of this study as proof of the harmful effects of &#8216;Discrimination&rsquo; is maddeningly asinine.  And this from Yale, an institution one would hope would not stoop to such maudlin, race pandering wording.  </p>
<p>I do have to wonder, though, whether some of those white women with excessive Visceral Fat do not have this figure problem because they have endured bullying by &#8216;minorities&rsquo;.  The living hell that is an integrated school could surely produce such an effect.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to see a Visceral Fat Comparison between Twelfth-Grade white girls who had endured integrated schools, and girls who had attended all-white schools.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the typical interracial couple:  Slim black male with obese white female.  Maybe this is so typical, because the years of stress from being in integrated schools has made these poor females gain fat (and not just &#8216;Visceral&rsquo;).</p>

<p>Which came first, the chicken or the egg?</p>
<p>Could being overweight lead to low-self image resulting in feelings of rejection, oppression, and discrimination?</p>

		<p>I think it is because the dummies likely to whine all day long about &#8220;discrimination&#8221; are also likely to eat at McDonalds every day during their government job lunch hours.</p>

They also found that woman who&rsquo;ve reported high levels of discrimination have darker skin. I think they are on to something. The fact that lazy fat people complain about discrimination more than energetic thin people.</p>

		<p>What&rsquo;s the hardest thing in the world to find? A black woman not talking on a cell phone! HA Ha! Since this is a racist and insensitive remark I assume that many black women will be forced into moon pie indulgence! </p>

		<p>Oh please!  I live in the South and constantly see obese black women who are eating fast food at school and work, and then wonder why they are heavy.  Most of us, and I mean people period, are not endowed with an ectomorphic build and fast metabolisms.  That includes me thanks to my Central and Eastern European heritage. But as usual,just about all of the black women I&rsquo;ve met who are unhappy about their weight just don&rsquo;t want do the hard work of regular exercise and making major lifestyle changes.  As for discrimination at work, well what do they expect in light of increasing health care costs? Employers also don&rsquo;t want employees who may have to be out alot due to illness/and or doctors&rsquo; appointments.  But as usual, blacks can&rsquo;t seem to connect the dots nor make these leaps of logic.</p>

		<p>Perhaps they have their causation reversed? This type of fat may relate also to behavior, making for more obnoxious personalities, regardless of race. Send these ball-busters out into a world which encourages them to find bias and <i>voila</i>!</p>

		<p>Why do irrelevant studies like this get published?</p>
<p>The future success of an academic researcher depends on the number of publications his name is associated with and the quality of the journals in which they are published. Any piece of research that claims to have discovered yet another source of racism, or yet another wicked manifestation of it, is assured publication, no matter how pointless and useless the research actually is. Of course, researchers figure this out and direct their studies accordingly. </p>

		<p>During the time of Lyndon Johnson&rsquo;s War on Poverty and Great Society, we were told over and over, that Bantus in America were one missed meal away from starvation, whether they lived in the inner city ghetto, or in rural Dixie. So they passed all these food stamp programs and Head Start programs and school lunch programs.</p>
<p>You could say, seeing all these fat pinguid Bantu women, that these programs had a positive effect after all! You never hear about Bantus in Compton, Newark or Alabama starving to death, anymore.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I don&rsquo;t think they ever were in danger of starvation, to begin with. It was just another lie LBJ promulgated, just like the non-incident in the Gulf of Tonkin. The latter was used to justify the escalation of the Vietnam War.    </p>
