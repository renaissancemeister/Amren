	<p>As boats carrying hundreds of Africans set sail for a better life in Europe, they were met on Italy&rsquo;s Lampedusa island with two words by a 5-foot, 8-inch blonde: go away.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cannot be allowed on the shore,&#8221; Marine Le Pen, the 42-year-old leader of France&rsquo;s anti-immigration National Front, said in a March 15 interview in Rome after a three-hour visit the previous day to Lampedusa. &#8220;Send boats out to feed them. But they must not set foot on land.&#8221;</p>
<p>The island, a speck in the Mediterranean Sea closer to Tunisia than Sicily, is experiencing first-hand an immigration surge poised to spread to the rest of Europe and drive a deeper wedge in a north-south divide already tested by the sovereign- debt crisis.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The month-long civil war in Libya between Muammar Qaddafi&rsquo;s regime and rebel forces in the oil-rich east has left 6,000 people dead, driven crude prices to a 2 1/2-year high and unleashed what Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, the country&rsquo;s most popular politician, called a &#8220;biblical exodus.&#8221;</p>
<p>North of Rome, a backlash has already begun as Italy warns its neighbors that 70 percent of Africans washing up on its shores are headed to France and Germany to seek work.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>One solution proposed by Chantal Brunel, a lawyer of French President Nicolas Sarkozy&rsquo;s Union for a Popular Movement, was to &#8220;put them back on their boats.&#8221; While she apologized for her March 8 remarks, her stance reflects the will of governments outside the Mediterranean rim to keep refugees at bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ready to help in economic terms, but I don&rsquo;t see the future in having us expand legal immigration,&#8221; German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in Brussels on March 15.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Since Jan. 15, more than 9,000 people  &mdash;  twice the number in 2010  &mdash;  have crossed 110 kilometers (70 miles) in boats from Tunisia to Lampedusa, inhabited by less than 6,000 people, the Italian Interior Ministry said.</p>
<p>Italy and Malta face the prospect of an influx of Libyans after severing ties with the former colony.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Last December, Qaddafi warned EU leaders that their region may &#8220;become black because millions want to come to Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of a reparation deal with Italy worth $5 billion, Qaddafi agreed in 2008 to tighten border controls. That led to the number of Libyan migrants to Italy falling to fewer than 3,000 in 2010 from a record 37,000 two years earlier. In Malta, the influx dropped from a 2008 high of 84 boats bringing 2,775 people to 2 boats carrying 47 in 2010.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>While arrivals to Lampedusa are shipped to the Italian mainland, immigrants arriving in Malta are held in detention centers for as long as 18 months. More than half of Malta&rsquo;s 2.5 million-euro military budget goes to food and shelter for the refugees.</p>
<p>Since the turmoil in Libya began on Feb. 15, Malta has received about 26,000 people evacuated by ship from the North African country by their governments and repatriated to their countries of origins.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Interior ministers from six EU countries near the Mediterranean Sea called on member states last month to back the creation of a special fund that will help them cope with an &#8220;uncontrolled&#8221; influx of immigration from Libya. Their appeal has gone nowhere.</p>

		<p>There are ~ 40 African and Middle-Eastern countries to which these immigrants from Africa and the Middle-East can immigrate.  These African and Middle-Eastern countries often have similar to virtually identical cultures, languages, and religions as the the immigrant&rsquo;s home countries, and, as such, would be a perfect fit for them.</p>
<p>There is no need for African and Middle-eastern people to immigrate to Europe, with its divergent culture, when more suitable destinations are just next door.   </p>

		<p>Why is it that everytime They mention Ms. Le Pen They refer to Her Blonde Hair. I suppose the Globalist Media want to draw Our attention to this because according to Them an obession with &#8220;Racial purity&#8221; must be motivating all this Nationalism and concern for Border Security and, and also National Security. And, I am convinced the Globalists really do want open European Borders.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Marine Le Pen and other Europeans fight back against African &ldquo;immigration surge.&rdquo; </p>
<p>If the out-to-lunch fools that comprise the European elites don&rsquo;t wake up soon&hellip;.like REAL soon&hellip;.they&rsquo;re going to have battles in their streets, because anti-immigration is heating up among the up-till-now complacent masses.</p>
<p>If the economy improves greatly, they might kick the racial conflict can down the road for another decade or two, but if the economic situation continues to decline watch out!  It will be civil war for sure.</p>
<p>Finally realizing now the masses are NOT assimilating is too little too late.  </p>

<p>Haha, classic. Europeans are waking up (finally) and figuring out, from their current immigrant populations, that these people are not like us, but very very different, and not in a good way. They are relearning that race is more than just the color of your skin and that a black african living in France isn&rsquo;t merely a Frenchmen who happens to have black skin, but an African who happens to live in France. We are different, but more importantly we are incompatible&hellip; sorry. Now go back to Africa.</p>

		<p>Unabashed fascism is the only thing that will save Europe from being inundated by the invasion from Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Europe was almost destroyed in the 1300s by the Black Death. Another version of the &#8220;Black Death&#8221; is sweeping up from Africa to destroy it in the 21st century.</p>
<p>By mid-century, Europeans will decline to 10% of the world&rsquo;s population (from 30% in 1950). Meanwhile, Africans will soar to 30% of the world&rsquo;s population (from 10% in 1950). Whites and blacks are trading places, and blacks and Middle Easterners will destroy native Europeans if Europeans do not develop some backbone. Unabashed fascism is the only answer!</p>

		<p>Europe is awash in African &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; this being made possible with the conniving of the ruling class of the various European countries directly involved in supporting this invasion. This bringing in of millions by the boat load is part of a scheme to replace the aging populations of the continent with migrants who will work for less and still be satisfied because their lot would still be much improved over what they have left behind. The major problem in all this is beyond the fact that European Whites living door to door with Africans is scarcely compatible nor harmonious there is the problem of Africans bringing Africa with them wherever they descend. Taking Africa to Europe will make things worse for everyone involved except perhaps for the upper 10% that profit from this demographic onslaught and who live far away from the ghettos that are even now spreading over the continent and slowing choking the fundamental European nature out of major parts of city after city. This will not mean the end of civilization but certainly a incalculable lowering of standards in almost every conceivable way in the great bastions of urban settlement all over the continent making life there less pleasant and more unstable if not down right precarious. </p>

<p><br>
But who would want to go  next door? You are absolutely correct. It does seem illogical (and to us undesireable). But TO THEM them there IS a great desire&hellip; to improve their standard of living immeasureably by moving from backwardness to a civilized,   prosperous  culture. </p>
<p><br>
Why would they would want to move to the same chaotic mess next door &hellip; a replica of home?</p>
<p><br>
And the other half  of the picture is that there also is an equal &#8216;need&rsquo;   &mdash;   to the race-replacing Marxists, idealists, globalists, and self-serving capitalists whose greatest  desire is to scramble and eliminate the earth&rsquo;s  fractious white populations once and for all, leaving themselves solely in uncontested control.</p>

<p>Perhaps she should consider darkening her hair, so as to deprive them of this propaganda advantage, which they so shamelessly exploit.<br>

<p>I notice Hillary Clinton has gone blonde, very gradually, over the past  years. But that&rsquo;s OK for her, being someone of the Left. The media NEVER refer to her (newly) blonde hair. Hmmm. Is there discrimination here? Only rightists are recognized as  being blonde.</p>
<p>And no one refers to Obama&rsquo;s purple lips.  Wonder why.</p>

		<p>I am an African American. I am middle-aged, really closer to old-age. Over the course of my life I have studied Africa and European colonization of the continent. I can remember being quite young and reading that the British considered the citizens of its colonized countries, &#8220;citizens&#8221; so to speak of Britain. I thought with horror, &#8220;Don&rsquo;t they know there are more of them than there are of actual British countrymen? If they(the colonized) actually decide to move to the British Isle, they will outnumber the indigenous Brits.&#8221; Fast forward fifty years, now look at the immigrated mess the Brits are facing. </p>
<p>The mass exodus out of Africa is part Muslim agenda and part by-product of and part due to the reverberations of the colonization of Africa. I have often wondered why Europeans have not put their minds to averting this problem by equipping formerly colonized African nations with the nation building tools and skills that Europeans employ to build and maintain effective cultures and societies. Why do they not first form a European council that would offer training to chosen representatives from Africans countries in various fields of concentration, to teach them city and community planning, architecture, landscaping, sanitation and waste treatment, development of the arts, museum organization and antiquity preservation, municipal and state fiscal responsibility, and options for workable governmental structures. </p>
<p>If they create in Africa, indigenous nations as advanced as the Europeans nations that the African see on television, then they would no longer want to leave where they live to have a better life for themselves and their children somewhere else. Instead of continuing to bleed Africa for it&rsquo;s riches, Europeans should should equip Africans to build Africa for Africans; which would lead to more European cultural security. People don&rsquo;t want to leave their homeland, but they do want to have better lives. <br>

<p>&#8220;If they create in Africa, indigenous nations as advanced as the Europeans nations that the African see on television, then they would no longer want to leave where they live to have a better life for themselves and their children somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>European nations have pumped over a TRILLION (with a T) dollars into Africa to no avail. In order for an African nation to be as advanced as a European nation, the African people would need to be as advanced as the European people. Unfortunately we just don&rsquo;t see this when comparing large populations (nations) of Africans (black or arab) and white Europeans. The differences between whites, blacks, and arabs is biological; resulting in an average difference in cognitive abilities and behavior, which logically results in different societal structures. </p>
<p>Long story short:</p>
<p>When given total freedom and left to their own devices, black Africans (and arabs to some extent) almost always create societies that are disfunctional, corrupt, violent, and extremely impoverished (regardless of the amount of natural resources present). When given freedom and left alone, whites almost always create advanced, stable, prosperous societies that are the envy of the world. Sorry, but that&rsquo;s the harsh reality.</p>
<p>Think about it this way. Approximately 53% of African American males didn&rsquo;t receive a hs diploma (according to the most recent figures). Now imagine what America would be like if it was all black and 53% of its male population wasn&rsquo;t capable of completing hs; which is the bare basic education that is given to them FOR FREE. The unemployment, and resulting crime, would be through the roof! Not to mention virtually zero scientific and technological advancement. In other words, America would turn into an African nation because the population would essentially be African. </p>
<p>Simply put: Africans bring Africa with them wherever they go and Europeans bring Europe with them wherever they go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of continuing to bleed Africa for it&rsquo;s riches, Europeans should should equip Africans to build Africa for Africans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dude, Europeans haven&rsquo;t owned an African colony for over 60 years. Get over it! And I agree with you that Africa is filled with abundant natural resources. But Africans aren&rsquo;t utilizing them. They are too busy starving, raping, killing, and cannibalizing eachother to do any major mining and manufacturing. But don&rsquo;t worry, I predict that within the next 40 or so years China will pay Africa a visit. And they will make good use of Africa&rsquo;s abundant resources&hellip;</p>
