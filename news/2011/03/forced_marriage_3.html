<h1><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12669909">Forced Marriages &#8216;At Record High&rsquo;  &mdash;  South Wales Police</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>BBC News, March 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>South Wales Police say they are dealing with the largest number of cases of forced marriage and honour based-violence they have ever seen.</p>
<p>In the past 12 months, the force has dealt with 49 cases of forced marriage, up from a typical 30-35, with new cases almost every week.</p>
<p>The four Welsh forces have been involved in about 60 cases, with four in north Wales in six months.</p>
<p>The figures are released to coincide with International Women&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>A forced marriage, as opposed to an arranged marriage, is where either bride or groom, or both, do not consent to a wedding and are coerced into accepting it.</p>
<p>In many cases they are told they will bring their family shame or dishonour if they refuse.</p>
<p>Ch Supt Neil Kinrade, head of South Wales Police&rsquo;s communities and partnerships department, said forced marriage was a &#8220;hidden harm&#8221; among some sectors of the community.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;I&rsquo;m pleased that we are dealing with the numbers [of cases that] we are, however, we are still only dealing with a small number of the actual incidents and practices that are taking place.</p>
<p>&#8220;This, amongst the community, is a hidden harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It goes on and it goes on often unchecked by senior members of the community who know it&rsquo;s taking place.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&rsquo;s less of a problem here than perhaps places like Bradford and London, but nevertheless, it is a problem and it&rsquo;s something that we need to do something about.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he believed his force had taken a lead role on the issue of forced marriage, drawing up a training scheme that was now used by more than half of UK police forces.</p>
<p>Strategies for helping victims included supplying them with a secret mobile phone if they feared they were being lured to their family&rsquo;s country of origin as a prelude to a forced marriage.</p>
<p>The force had also set up a &#8220;buddy&#8221; system where force marriage &#8220;survivors&#8221; were a role model to those who were now going through the trauma.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;Complete shock&rsquo;</b></p>
<p>Ch Supt Kinrade added: &#8220;We do understand the issues and I think we are becoming more effective at dealing with it but what I sense is happening is there is an East v West clash.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said young people were being educated in south Wales and were &#8220;very westernised&#8221; then their families give them the news that they have had a partner chosen for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that often comes as a complete shock to them, against their intent to go to university, to maybe follow a career path. And that&rsquo;s where many youngsters are rejecting it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think that&rsquo;s important, because here in the UK - and this is the government and the police stance - people must have their basic human rights of determining their own future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gwent Police said they had 14 incidents recorded under honour-based violence in 2009/10 and a further five in 2010/11.</p>
<p>Dyfed-Powys Police said they had been involved in two cases of forced marriage over the past two years.<br>

He said young people were being educated in south Wales and were &ldquo;very westernised&rdquo; then their families give them the news that they have had a partner chosen for them.</p>

&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but the first question that comes to mind for me is: </p>
<p>&#8220;What does the girl or boy do that they need to be protected by whites to achieve their life goals?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s not just that she comes from a culture with a lower statistical IQ than ours or that she is &#8216;doing well&rsquo; in her new Western life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s that -even if- she is a future brain surgeon, MP or Nobel Laureate, she is effectively forcing herself, her culture and her genes upon a population that was doing _just fine_ before she came.</p>
<p>Displacing whites by taking collegiate openings that may or may not have been earned so much as allocated.</p>
<p>Bringing her -other- siblings acculturated attitudes to our society (maybe they don&rsquo;t fight as hard, maybe they bring back a genetic disease from this terribly inbred population, certainly they -add to the population problem- because they aren&rsquo;t breeding within our group, thank heavens&hellip;).</p>
<p>It seems that the only people who find purposeful &#8216;mission&rsquo; in this are the crisis handlers and the social enablers.  The people who are paid to deal with a problem that would not happen if the population it is endemic within were not in the West to begin with.</p>
<p>&gt;<br>
&ldquo;And I think that&rsquo;s important, because here in the UK - and this is the government and the police stance - people must have their basic human rights of determining their own future.&rdquo;<br>
&gt;</p>
<p>No.  What&rsquo;s important is that, if these people do not enter our genetic population base, any economic achievement for themselves is a slice of the economic pie that the rest of us will never get back, once it&rsquo;s cut for the outsiders.  And they are so ugly, in person and in habits, to us that they are virtually excluded from our society at that level anyway.</p>
<p>&#8216;Forced Marriage&rsquo; when there are so few alternative choices in your new home thus becomes a match maker alternative for importing -yet more- problems.<br>

Hey, don&rsquo;t forget about the other East v West cultural clash that is on the rise, acid attacks!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Study into UK acid attacks starts&rsquo; (BBC May 2010)<br>
<a href="https://goo.gl/eCQeX" rel="nofollow">https://goo.gl/eCQeX</a> </p>
<p>The organization &ldquo;Acid Survivors Trust International&rdquo; (ASTI) are who normally work in countries such as  Uganda, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Cambodia are commissioning a study into UK based acid attacks (thanks diversity).</p>
<p>Psy Ops quotes&hellip;<i>&rdquo;Rick Trask, director of the trust, said <b>he did not think such violence in Britain was rising</b>, but said it was being brought to the public&rsquo;s attention by a number of cases&rdquo;.</i></p>
<p>No rise, just a &lsquo;perceived&rsquo; rise (thanks to some incidents being irresponsibly &lsquo;reported&rsquo;). </p>
<p>&hellip;<i>Mr Trask said such assaults happened in a number of different cultures and religions overseas and therefore the trust&rsquo;s research would not focus on any one particularly community in the UK.</i> </p>
<p>See the prior list of different &lsquo;cultures and religions&rsquo; that exist in countries like Uganda, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Cambodia (and now the UK).</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It&rsquo;s important to remember this is not a new phenomenon (in Britain),&#8221; he added. &#8220;In Victorian times, vitriolic acid was used for revenge attacks in the crime world.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>The three perpetrators names mentioned in this article &ldquo;Mohammed Vakas, Mohammed Adeel and Fabion Kuci&rdquo; don&rsquo;t really sound like Victorian era English names.</p>
<p>&hellip;.&ldquo;The NHS Information Centre said acid attack patient figures may be recorded in up to six different categories&rdquo;. </p>
<p>&hellip;.&rdquo;One of these - &#8220;assault by corrosive substance&#8221; -saw 69 patients admitted to hospitals in 2008/2009, compared to 67 the previous year and 44 the year before that.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Looks like a steady rise in the numbers of people attacked, due to those darn Victorian historical reenactors.<br>
