<h1><a href="https://www.numbersusa.com/content/news/march-15-2011/cis-nearly-200000-children-born-us-temporary-foreign-visitors.html">CIS: Nearly 200,000 Children Born in U.S. to Temporary Foreign Visitors</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>NumbersUSA, March 15, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A new report by the Center for Immigration Studies finds that 200,000 children were born to women who were lawfully admitted to the United States on a temporary basis. These 200,000 children receive automatic citizenship to the United States despite the mother&rsquo;s allegiance to another nation. {snip}</p>
<p>In addition to CIS&rsquo; finding on births to foreign visitors, the report also found that 300,000 children are born to children of illegal alien parents each year.</p>
<p>Of the 200,000 children born to visitors, CIS found that in 20% of the cases (39,000), the mother came to the United States for the sole purpose of giving birth  &mdash;  a practice known as birth tourism. Another 20,000 births are estimated to young foreign women who reside in the United States for temporary stays of multiple years such as students and guest workers. </p>

		<p>I wonder how many of these babies are born to muslim women who take those babies back to the Middle East to indoctrinate them to hate the west. Eighteen years later these &#8220;American citizens&#8221; can join our military, command submarines or train to become airline pilots. We are engaged in slow-motion suicide.</p>

		<p>I read of a clinic in Los Angeles that caters to high income Chinese. The clinic provides nurses and other staff that speak Mandarin. After the baby is born, they go back to China with their US citizen child. When the child is 21, he can then sponsor his parents to enter the US via chain migration. I think we need to change our citizenship laws to prevent birth tourism.</p>

		<p>Quiet simply the laws are archaic and stupid, ya but the pride about our ancestors. It is only when people get their heads out of the stand that foreigners can be stopped. We are 6% of the world population yet have 60% of the worlds lawyers or something like that give or take, hope they can figure it out. Smart whites outsmatred by the not so smart non-whites using their own laws. </p>

		<p>Reply to Lucas and everyone else reading this article:</p>
<p>These children, if they take advantage of their inherited U.S. citizenship, and live establish residence in the U.S.A. for at least 14 years, are able to become President, upon turning 35!  Where as naturalised Americans like Henry Kissinger, Madeliene Albright, or the late Bob Hope who was born England, and whose loyalty to our country is unquestioned, cannot become President.</p>
<p>Lucas, it is scary to think that these Muslims you describe, because of their natural-born American citizenship, can become President, when they become 35 years of age!</p>
<p>The Founding Fathers of our country established the natural-born citizebship requirement for the Presidency, to be sure that the President would not have any loyalties to any foreign power and to protect America from being taken over another country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this day and age of rapid international travel, this Constitutional safeguard is no longer an effective barrier to prevent any of this from happening.  The Muslims you describe, and any other foreign powers wanting to take over America, can simply send their women on a tour to have their babies born in America!</p>

		<p>The parents and other relatives don&rsquo;t have to wait until the child is 21 to get the right to stay in America. They can file an application with US immigration claiming that returning to their native country would create &#8220;hardship&#8221; for a US citizen. If approved, the parents will get a green card and permanent residency status, and five years later, they can apply to become citizens. I have personally seen this happen.</p>
<p>Also, the illegal aliens aren&rsquo;t waiting until the child is 21 to reap the benefits of having a US citizen child.</p>

		<p>:  Wong Kim Ark (1898) case<br>
The Wong Kim Ark (WKA) case is often cited as the linchpin for the legal status of anchor babies.  There has been plenty of commentary on WKA, but the truly narrow application of WKA is emphasized reviewing the concise statement of the question the case was meant to decide, written by Hon. Horace Gray, Justice for the majority in this decision.    <br>
	&ldquo;[W]hether a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States by virtue of the first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.&rdquo;  (Italics added.)<br>
For WKA to justify birthright citizenship, the parents must have &ldquo;&hellip;permanent domicile and residence&hellip;&rdquo;  But how can an illegal alien have permanent residence when the threat of deportation is constantly present?  There is no statute of limitation for illegal presence in the US and the passage of time does not eliminate the legal remedy of deportation.   This alone would seem to invalidate WKA as a support and precedent for illegal alien birthright citizenship. <br>
Legal aliens can indeed have a &ldquo;.  . .permanent domicile and residence&hellip;&rdquo; and WKA appears to be written for this class of persons.  However, we note that if legal alien parents are unemployed, unemployable, illegally employed, or if they get their living by illegal means, then they are not &ldquo;&hellip;carrying on business&hellip;&rdquo;, and so the children of indigent or criminal &ldquo;legal aliens&rdquo; may not be eligible for birthright citizenship.  This is a more extreme point, and its main use may be to show the poor quality of the WKA decision.  <br>
Because the statement of the case for WKA appears to address the specific situation of the children of legal aliens, it is not an applicable precedent to justify birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens.<br>
Occasionally foreign couples take a trip to the US during the last phase of the wife&rsquo;s pregnancy so she can give birth in the US, conferring birthright citizenship on the child.  This practice is called &ldquo;birth tourism.&rdquo;   WKA calls out two qualifications to allow birthright citizenship:    permanent residence and doing business.  A temporary visit answers neither condition.  WKA is therefore disqualified as justification and precedent for a &ldquo;birth tourism&rdquo; child to be granted birthright citizenship.  <br>

		<p>My son went to high school with a Haitian boy.  The boy was well mannered, well brought up and spoke perfect English and French.  He was from an obviously rich elite family.  He was born in Miami.  So were most of his relatives for a couple generations.  The extended family owns a lot of real estate and small businesses in Miami and other Florida cities.</p>
<p>When the women are about 5 months pregnant they just fly to Florida and stay there until the babies are born and about 6 months old.  They have to pay for American health insurance of course, using one the address of one of their apartment buildings or businesses in Florida.</p>
<p>System works perfectly.  They maintain fully furnished apartments in Florida with cars in the garage.  For this family, it is as simple as Canadiens, Americans and Mexicans crossing the border  for nearby goods and services.</p>
<p>When I worked at a huge medical center/ university that had medical, dental, nursing, public health schools and vast residency and intern programs for foreign nationals I could not help but notice that virtually every Asian and Indian woman managed to have babies while in the US.  It is inconvenient for a Dr to have a baby while trying to function as an intern and study for qualifying exams, but the benefits of having an anchor baby far outweighted the emotional, physical and practical problems of having a baby while in the throes of medical school or internship. </p>

<p>They come in the first few months.  </p>
<p>If there were such a law Soros/ACLU/SPLC and all the usual suspects would go bananas.  The law would be struck down by every Judge in the country.</p>
<p>There are midwives in the US border states who will, for a fee file a USA birth certificate for children actually born on the Mexican side of the border.   Of course there are also maternity home on the American side filled with pregnant Mexican women who give birth in American hospitals and then go home.<br>

<p>I have also seen that here in the Los Angeles area and I agree 100% with you.  What is worst is a lot of these Chinese/Korean anchor babies actually come back BEFORE the age of 21 and attend High School and even colleges (UC System, anyone) off tax payer&rsquo;s dime.</p>
<p>If you thought the UC system was overfilled with Asians now&hellip; wait 2 more decade when most of these kids are exempt from having to pay international student tuition and might even get grants thereby pushing more white kids out of the system.    </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t fret - the bottom will have fallen out of this leftist ponzi scheme long before two decades. <br>
California will be totally bankrupt and welfare cutbacks will cause the blacks and mestizos (whose lives are totally dependent upon sucking off the taxpayer) to either flee from the state or turn feral. Chaos will come to California long before these anchor babies can reap the benefits.</p>

		<p>You would not have to wait two decades. the UC schools are strapped for cash especially with all of the AB540 students. These are illegal aliens who are allowed to pay in state tuition but get no financial aid. This may be changing if the California Dream Act passes. They are actively looking for students out of state and internationally who will be able to pay the more expensive out of state tuition that the illegals should be paying but are not.</p>
