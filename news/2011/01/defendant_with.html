			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jeremy Roebuck, Inquirer (Philadelphia), January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>With a flick of his wrist, the interpreter at the front of the courtroom mimed the bang of a judge&rsquo;s gavel, his other hand pointing to the ceiling. </p>
<p>The crude gestures were meant to convey that the case against Juan Jose Gonzalez Luna would be heard in a higher-level court.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Did the 42-year-old [Juan Jose Gonzalez Luna]  &mdash;  who is deaf, mute, and illiterate, including no known knowledge of sign language  &mdash;  understand what had just happened?</p>
<p>As Gonzalez has next to no language skills, his case has baffled Montgomery County courts since his arrest on drug trafficking charges late last year. While courts have come a long way in providing access to interpreters in a host of exotic languages, no one is sure how to translate for a man who knows no language at all.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Accommodating those with limited access to language is a rare problem in U.S. courts, but one that judges have met with limited success. </p>
<p>Many have avoided the problem, declaring such defendants incompetent to stand trial. Others have relied on a complex and imperfect method of interpretation, one still viewed with skepticism by many in the legal profession.</p>
<p>And while most courts say they do their best, a good effort is not good enough, said Michele LaVigne, a lawyer and scholar at the University of Wisconsin Law School.</p>
<p>It is not, after all, that defendants like Gonzalez are incompetent to stand trial, but that the U.S. court system largely remains ill-suited for trying them.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Gonzalez&rsquo;s limited grasp began at infancy in the southern reaches of the Mexican state of Michoacán. Although uncertain of much of his client&rsquo;s history, Rideout thinks Gonzalez lost his hearing after a severe fever as a baby  &mdash;  a story reenacted through pantomime. </p>
<p>ith no formal education and little exposure to other deaf people, Gonzalez grew up virtually without language. He has picked up a few signs over the years. </p>
<p>But this inability to communicate is exactly what made him a valued member of a King of Prussia-based drug trafficking ring, prosecutors say.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes the perfect drug mule,&#8221; First Assistant District Attorney Kevin Steele said. &#8220;He can&rsquo;t consent to a search. He can&rsquo;t answer any questions about the operation.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Arriving at a recent preliminary hearing, he motioned toward detectives gathered around him. He pinched at his neck as if adjusting an invisible necktie. He bent his other arm mid-torso and clenched its fist, mimicking a heavy briefcase.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&rsquo;t talk to the judge,&#8221; one detective joked. &#8220;But of course he knows how to ask for his lawyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In many recent cases, declaring incompetence for trial has become a standard reaction, Tuck said. Many judges order confinement to institutional language programs, hoping the defendant can be taught American Sign Language and eventually stand trial.</p>

		<p>When a person on trial does not speak the language of the court, it is far easier to lie under oath.  As a matter of fact it is far easier to lie in any situation when you don&rsquo;t speak the language of the folks opposing you.  This is something that these Hispanics sometimes take advantage of.  The interpreter in the courtroom is not the prosecutor.  It is so much easier to talk to a 3rd party interpreter and not be honest.  Just another advantage that these people have.  This guy supposedly is a deaf mute too, with no sign language training and little communication abilities.</p>
<p>In this situation though in all candor and fairness, I must admit that I do feel some sympathy for this man and his plight.  He probably didn&rsquo;t even understand what he was doing.  Putting him on trial serves no purpose in my opinion.  The real dealers should be on trial.  Oh that&rsquo;s right I forgot, they don&rsquo;t capture easy, and when they do get captured they intimidate the prosecution and cry racism.</p>

		<p>If he can&rsquo;t communicate, how did he receive the information about where and how to transport the drugs? Why not just prove he did do it, and by logic prove he is not deaf as they say?</p>

		<p>I agree with poster number 2.  He is capable of understand enough to be given instructions as to where to go and to whom to deliver the drugs he was carrying.<br>
They trusted his comprehension enough to entrust their valuable drugs to his care.<br>
Methinks this guy is playing the &#8220;no comprendo&#8221; game so many hispanic criminals play, with a new twist.  Look for more &#8220;deaf, mute, illiterate non-english, non-signing&#8221; mules to come through the court system, especially if this guy is let off.</p>

		<p>I agree with William Hendershot. If I remember correctly, a drug mule is someone who carries the drugs from a dealer in one country to another, so that the dealers don&rsquo;t have to risk getting caught themselves. Wouldn&rsquo;t that require SOME language? Such as &#8220;do this when you cross the border&#8221;? I find it hard to believe that they could simply pantomime the whole thing to him and expect him to do it right. Then again, maybe that&rsquo;s why he got caught.</p>
<p>Also, how would he pantomime losing his hearing as a baby? Unless he was compensated with preternatural abilities of memory, it seems like someone would have to have told him why he couldn&rsquo;t hear. I think he may be having them on.</p>

		<p>In our wonderland of equality and diversity instead of prosecuting a Hispanic deaf, mute,who is also illiterate we may advance to the point of electing him to public office.</p>

Is he an illegal alien?  Almost certainly! (Otherwise, how did he fill out paperwork, answer questions, and immigrate legally?)</p>
<p>If he&rsquo;s illegal, deport him!  That&rsquo;s all. He&rsquo;s not ours.  Why waste all this time and money fussing over him?  He should not be here and he should not be our problem.</p>

		<p>This won&rsquo;t be hard to prosecute; if he was caught with the drugs, the court has him dead-to-rights.  There are plenty of guys doing time who said nothing at all during their trials.  The down-side here is that the prosecutors have no way to lean on Luna to get him to rat out his accomplices, and THAT is precisely the point of using a deaf-mute as a drug mule; his boss has insulated himself quite nicely from involvement in this case.<br>

		<p>If drug trafficking was a death penalty offense, people wouldn&rsquo;t traffic in drugs.  Period.</p>
<p>If we sealed our borders so that &#8216;deaf, mute, or just plain clever&rsquo; no one who wasn&rsquo;t invisible could get through, this man&rsquo;s deficits also wouldn&rsquo;t be at issue.</p>
<p>While I hesitate to use the &#8216;retarded man can&rsquo;t understand why he&rsquo;s being executed for rape/robbery/murder thus we need not pity his fear of an execution he also doesn&rsquo;t get&rsquo; argument, I can certainly see a lot better uses for the money this guy will have spent on him than an indefinite (that&rsquo;s right, they have one prisoner who raped two kids back in 1992 and is &#8216;still learning&rsquo; because ASL is &#8216;too hard&rsquo;) incarceration period while being taught to use sign language.</p>
<p>If nothing else, we now have this guy&rsquo;s face on a digital database of known border hoppers (present at every legit border station) and as his history is now well known, any subsequent recapture will instantly raise the spectre of drugs, making him useless as a mule.</p>
<p>How this guy is used as one is also probably simple.  Imagine the scenario if you will: &#8220;You want the good life in America?  Our coyote will take you there, free, with a bellyfull of coke.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s cheap, and it&rsquo;s a single-time vulnerability whose faces will never repeat to law enforcement.</p>
<p>Now imagine simplifying even this scenario.  So the guy only has to have a imprint on the individual who feeds and gives him a place to stay at night and he will follow his handler, without question and only the crudest of hand gestures.</p>
<p>Drug smuggling and human smuggling ARE THE SAME.</p>
<p>What better argument can there be for stopping both, _at the border_?</p>

		<p>These cases could be solved by declaring English as the official language of the U.S.  There is no reason for the legal system to grind to a halt while experts are called in at great expense to accommodate the accused.  I doubt that other countries provide English interpreters for free during trials.</p>

		<p>I am very sceptical about this case. If he is unable to communidate anything or to comprehend anything, how did he understand where to go, what to do, etc?</p>
