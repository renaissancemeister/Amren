<h1>Schools Get Flak for Makeup Day Choice</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Fred Clasen-Kelly, Charlotte Observer, January 12, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Calling the decision &#8220;disrespectful,&#8221; Charlotte City Council member Patrick Cannon on Tuesday harshly criticized the school district&rsquo;s announcement that students would attend classes on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to make up for a snow day.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, the Charlotte chapter of the NAACP called for local clergy to urge church members to keep their children out of school Monday.</p>
<p>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools had planned next Monday as a holiday, but a severe winter storm has closed school so far this week.</p>
<p>In a brief interview, Cannon said the district is showing insensitivity to the legacy of the civil rights hero and to people who organized activities to recognize the holiday. He said some people had planned trips to places like Memphis and Atlanta, to visit well-known civil rights museums.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows a sign of disrespect even if that&rsquo;s not what is intended,&#8221; Cannon said. &#8220;More consideration should be given.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a prepared statement Tuesday, the NAACP&rsquo;s Charlotte branch attacked Superintendent Peter Gorman for scheduling a makeup day on the King holiday. &#8220;He continues to demonstrate a blatant deliberate disconnect with the African American community,&#8221; the statement read.</p>

		<p>You can never please them. The NAACP will claim it is the fault of the school system that black children are behind, and yet it wants black children to skip school. They are academically lagging white children, but they are being encouraged to put in less effort. And how many of them really are going to go to any activity. Most will just watch TV or otherwise waste time. Some may do even worse.</p>

<p>For African-Americans, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter if they attend school or not attend school   &mdash;   the results will be the same, won&rsquo;t they? </p>

		<p>I would venture a guess that if Christmas day has been chosen as a makeup day there would not be as much of a fuss. MLK day has become mandatory for schools and states- otherwise you will be charged as a &#8220;racist&#8221; or worse. </p>

		<p>Monday is probably also Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Birthday (observed) in North Carolina.  Isn&rsquo;t that decision also disrespectful to whites?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if the NAACP gets what it wants, the Monday might actually be a pretty good day in Charlotte&rsquo;s public schools.  At least for one day, teachers and students can cover a lot of ground and in relative peace.</p>

		<p>Pearl Harbor day had the most meaning for me when on one Dec. 7th a WWII vet teacher explained the significance of that day.</p>
<p>He told us the story of sailors trapped inside a ship who couldn&rsquo;t be located in time to rescue, but had written on the walls &#8220;What happened?&#8221;  &mdash;   seen only when their bodies were found days later.</p>
<p>He explained that on Dec. 8th the lines to enlist in the Armed Forces wrapped around the block even though no one could properly pronounce Oahu. How his friends had died in the war along with millions of others.</p>
<p>Another day off from school wouldn&rsquo;t have been respectful to the people shattered by Pearl Harbor.</p>
<p>President&rsquo;s Day was just a day for us to go skiing, not to learn about a man like George Washington who actually threatened to hang anyone who talked about anointing him King of America. Respect would have been furthered by going to school to learn about him, not skiing.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t dishonor Martin Luther King to attend school on his holiday, though the ski resorts, arcades and Blockbuster video will certainly tell us so.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;m sure President&rsquo;s Day would be a far more sensitive choice, since it&rsquo;s nothing more than a combination of Lincoln&rsquo;s and Washington&rsquo;s birthdays, and is now nothing more than an excuse to hold white sales.</p>

		<p>I have a friend in SC who tells me that the Spartanburg County school system is doing the same thing because they&rsquo;ve just missed too many days due to the weather.  I&rsquo;m not sure why but at my place of employment they give us this day off but we have some departments working that day because of a heavy workload and no one is raising a stink about it.  Of course, we only have one black working there. To me this is not even a real holiday but something akin to an observance like Secretaries Day or Boss Day.    </p>

		<p>I have a dream that one day, all these &#8216;civil rights&rsquo; and race hustlers will be exposed and brought to justice.  I have a dream that one day, whites will be free to live amongst themselves without tyranny from others.  I have a dream that one day whites will stop feeling guilty and ashamed of who we are and our history.  I have a dream that one day, whites will gain a pro-white racial backbone and have large families like they did in the old days.  Free at last.  Free at last!  God almighty, free at last!</p>

		<p>Oh come on. MLK was a phoney degenerate. So who cares about his ignorant holiday? How about the black churches actually teaching their people about the immorality of this man, and his phoney christianity? </p>
<p>The NAACP will moan about anything. I am surprised that coffee does not offend them. MLK does not deserve a holiday. It is a joke.</p>

		<p>Kids in my school district have far too many days off to begin with! Just in January alone kids return from Christmas break on January 3rd and then have January 14th-17th off for MLK break. There are two more 3 or 4 day weekends before Spring Break in March- then a couple more before school is out in June. I have to wonder how much learning goes on when kids are always getting a day or two off. Even with the heavy snowfall we get in the Salt Lake Valley I have not seen a snow day called yet but I would wonder if the school year would be shorter if they cut out all of the professional days. </p>

		<p>At the college I go to, we get virtually no holidays off (if they fall outside of a break) EXCEPT Martin Luther King Jr Day. <br>
Now, it isn&rsquo;t that I am opposed to not going to school on Martin Luther King Day; I just find it ridiculous that it is the ONLY holiday that we are given off, why not days such as Columbus Day? Is that not important to Euro-Americans? Specifically Italian Americans?<br>
Does not surprise me though, our college also make a huge deal out of the Black Expo and even has a Latino club (cannot join if you are not Hispanic) and hosts major multicultural propaganda. </p>

<p>  &mdash;  Spartan24</p>
<p>It may seem crazy to you (not that it isn&rsquo;t) but here is the skinny on how instructional time works:</p>
<p>The school year in the district where I work is defined in minutes, not days, &#8220;instructional&#8221; (define that as you will) minutes to be specific.  Extra days are built in at the end of the year to make up for any lost instructional minutes or each day may be extended by five minutes to make up for professional development time.</p>
<p>As long as the minutes add up to the government-mandated yearly time, the sequence of days does not matter, nor the length of the school day.  It may seem like there are a lot of breaks and days off and early dismissals but believe me, the government keeps a sharp eye on actual instructional minutes however they are delivered on whatever days.  </p>
<p>One school district I read about discovered at the end of the school year that they hadn&rsquo;t covered all of the mandated minutes and had to extend their year by an extra week or two.  Everyone was furious, of course.</p>
<p>My own union keeps an eye on these minutes as well and there have been cases where we teachers have won reductions in the school day or year because we were scheduled to go over the mandated minutes and the school district refuses to pay us overtime. </p>
<p>This is also what keeps the government from extending the school year (not that it would matter) or lengthening the school day (not that that would work either)   &mdash;   they want us to work extra days without compensation. </p>
<p>Then, they get their friends in the media to vilify us teachers as &#8216;greedy&rsquo;, &#8216;overpaid&rsquo;, &#8216;non-productive&rsquo; or even as &#8216;prima donnas&rsquo; and parade the latest test scores on the front page.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s solution is to union-bust    &mdash;    attack the unions, of course, and teachers, as always, as impeding the &#8216;instructional&rsquo; process, of not producing the desired results.  In my area &#8216;activists&rsquo; with the backing of the ACLU are going to court to rip apart our union/district contract.</p>
<p>And they are winning.</p>
<p>More time does not equal more learning; high school kids, especially the new non-White cohort, have the attention span of a gnat.</p>
<p>Hope that&rsquo;s as clear as mud.</p>
<p>Bon</p>
