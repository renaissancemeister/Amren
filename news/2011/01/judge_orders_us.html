			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diane Macedo, Fox News, January 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A federal judge&rsquo;s ruling could pave the way for taxpayer-funded legal representation for immigrants facing deportation in cases of mental incapacity  &mdash;  a move praised by civil libertarians but opposed by advocates of stricter immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee recently ordered the U.S. government to give two mentally incapacitated illegal immigrants legal representation to fight their deportations. The decision was triggered by the case of Jose Franco-Gonzalez, 30, who spent nearly five years in immigration custody after pleading guilty to assault with a deadly weapon because authorities determined he was too mentally incompetent to represent himself in his own deportation hearings. Traditionally public counsel is not supplied in U.S. deportation cases</p>
<p>Gee ruled that Franco and another plaintiff be released and that additional plaintiffs in the case be given representation for their hearings, pleasing supporters who say the decision is a first step in ensuring that the rights of the mentally ill are not ignored.</p>
<p>But critics say the decision inappropriately places a new financial burden on American taxpayers and ignores the risk of keeping sometimes dangerous immigrants in the U.S.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;These are individuals who get lost in the system because of their serious mental illnesses. Many of them suffer from hallucinations, many of them suffer from paranoia caused by their hallucinations and they&rsquo;re just simply incapacitated and unable to represent themselves,&#8221; Michael Steinberg, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, told FoxNews.com.</p>
<p>But retired Immigration and Naturalization Service senior agent Michael Cutler says it&rsquo;s not the government&rsquo;s responsibility to provide legal defense for aliens who face removal from the United States.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Cutler says judges need to remember why we have immigration laws.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fundamental reason for immigration laws is to keep aliens out of our country or remove aliens from our country whose presence is harmful to our nation and/or our citizens. We have people involved with mental illness and prone to fits of violence based on mental illness  &mdash;  where&rsquo;s the positive impact this has on America?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The idea that we want to be compassionate is misplaced if one of these guys goes off and injures someone or worse.&#8221;</p>

		<p>The argument that we must be compassionate is beginning to wear thin on a lot of issues. I&rsquo;m getting tired of it. I am now beginning to think that compassion is now the last refuge of a scoundrel, and not patriotism </p>

<p>Now, wait a minute! Stop right there!  What&rsquo;s this stuff about <i>&#8220;immigrants&#8221;?</i></p>
<p>And illegal alien border jumper is NOT AN IMMIGRANT!<br>
Dangerous one or not, he&rsquo;s not an immigrant of any kind.</p>
<p>Now, not only journalists, but even judges are falling for the propaganda.</p>
<p>When will they finally get this legal fine point straight?  Is this  just too difficult to comprehend?  If a judge can&rsquo;t understand it, she shouldn&rsquo;t be a judge!<br>

<p>In checking on this Judge Gee, I find that her parents were immigrants from China. As a law clerk, she was a proteg√©e of Judge    Milton Schwartz of the US  District Court for Eastern California; then she was nominated  to a judgeship on the court by Barack Obama in 2009.</p>
<p>This are the people in whose hands our country now rests! We are at their mercy. Is it any wonder our borders are open, our industry has moved to China, our cities are in ruin, the dollar is in decline, and our economy is a down-spiraling mess? </p>

		<p>Dolly &#8220;Gee&#8221; sounds Chinese.  I wonder if diversity is truly our strength.  What is the policy of China towards mentally-deficient immigrants?  Or any Asian nation for that matter?  Or even any non-white nation in the world.</p>

YES we do seem to have a shortage of RETARDED people in the USA in general, but not in The Washington DC area, there they seem to flourish?</p>
<p>Why not take this one step further? There are still some working people who have enough money to eat and live (of course not like the politicians) why not figure out a way to take even more of what they earn and distribute it to the freeloaders of America and the World. Working people are allowed to keep too much of what they earn, they need to share it. Unless they work for the Government that is emptying waste baskets (AA at work) for $150,000 a year.</p>

<p>Yes, this Judge Dolly Gee is definitely an heir and product of those subversive phrases inscribed on the Statue of Liberty by those who had an agenda of their own to serve. </p>
<p>Verses that were put there years AFTER the statue&rsquo;s erection and which had NOTHING to do with its original meaning, when it was a gift from France. Those destructive, seditious phrases have completely perverted the meaning of the statue. And they have wrecked what was the America  it honored.  Meanwhile, most Americans have no idea!</p>
<p>The statue was a gift to honor the USA&rsquo;s first centennial, commemorating the alliance with France, and as a monument to the republican form of government (government of and by the people). It had nothing to do with immigration (which at that time was not yet large).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll bet that if you ask almost any average American or schoolkid what the statue is all about, they will tell you that it is about immigration. It is  there to welcome immigrants!  After years of being fed this false propaganda, that is all they know.</p>

		<p>I married a filipina when I was stationed in the Philippines.  We had 2 kids born on the base.<br>
When we began her U.S. Visa Application, she had to prove that she had no chronic physical or mental disorders. Plus much more, such as she had never been and is presently not a member of a communist group.  <br>
It took us 2 years to process her Visa app.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a little angry when an illegal crosses into the USA and is granted more benefits then I am as a veteran.</p>

<p>Uh huh. We already are. The smartest people in our best industries are restricted from entering the country in large numbers so that the wealth will trickle down to the everyday person in the US. If it weren&rsquo;t for left wing rich people, this country would be a fend-for-yourself place like Peru with the highly educated very rich and everyone else being reduced to a street person or a farmer. Under that scenario where would you be? If you didn&rsquo;t get an A in calculus in high school you&rsquo;re on the street. If you didn&rsquo;t finish toward the top of your class in law school, you&rsquo;re trapping squirrels in the park for food.</p>

		<p>The statue of liberty was  given to us as a peace offering. Has nothing to do <br>
with immigrants or immigration. No individual should be forced to share there wealth.  I work very hard for my family. Not for the lazy and righteous people. If you want other peoples earnings, stop wanting and start working! </p>
