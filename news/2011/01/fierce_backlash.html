<h1><a href="https://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=250757">Fierce Backlash Against MLK Critic</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Brian Fitzpatrick, WorldNetDaily, January 13, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Greeley, Colo. businessman Brett Reese, a real estate investor and owner of radio station KELS and the Greeley Gazette newspaper, has been weathering the storm since last Friday, when he began twice-daily broadcasts of a listener&rsquo;s commentary questioning whether America should celebrate Martin Luther King Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me it&rsquo;s a First Amendment right, but apparently in our society you can&rsquo;t pee on the altar of political correctness. That is enough to get you death threats,&#8221; Reese told WND.</p>
<p>KELS, better known as 104.7 Pirate Radio, devotes most of its programming to music, but the station also routinely runs commentaries related to upcoming events like the Jan. 17 MLK holiday. Reese airs such commentaries for up to two weeks at a time.</p>
<p>The controversial five-minute commentary raises a set of historically accurate but rarely acknowledged facts about King, including his repeated sexual infidelities and plagiarism. The commentary refers to King as an &#8220;America-hating communist,&#8221; a charge that is disputed. It also describes King as a &#8220;sexual degenerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commentary initially referred to a website that Reese subsequently discovered was linked to a racist organization. After Reese found out about the racism, he removed any mention of the website.</p>
<p>The Greeley District 6 School Board reacted harshly to the commentary, issuing a statement castigating Reese and affirming celebration of MLK Day.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;They&rsquo;re all a bunch of flaming radical lefties,&#8221; said Reese, who said he is the only conservative on the board. &#8220;I&rsquo;ve had my character assassinated.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>As a consequence of airing the commentary, Reese told WND he has received death threats, in person, to himself and his family. He added that numerous death threats have been posted on discussion boards of Denver-area news websites.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Critics have also launched a campaign to drive Pirate Radio&rsquo;s sponsors away from the radio station.</p>
<p>Advertiser Matt Arguello, owner of Gwen&rsquo;s Salon, confirmed that he has received threatening phone calls, but he refuses to knuckle under.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re going to continue to advertise on Pirate Radio,&#8221; Arguello told WND. &#8221; I compare it to being strong-armed by the mob. I&rsquo;m not going to be strong-armed because somebody wants to silence somebody. I think that&rsquo;s wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>

		<p>&#8220;My friends all think you are a racist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they do, and they probably think you are a racist, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because when they go into your house, they don&rsquo;t see a shrine to Martin Luther King in your living room.  Almost as bad, they don&rsquo;t see any framed pictures of Rosa Parks adorning every wall. You are definitely a racist!&#8221;</p>

		<p>I wish people just had the intestinal fortitude to make intelligent an reasonable comments rather than make threats. It only shows the caliber of the people making such threats. People who continually accuse others of oppression are the ones I see as the threateners and black-mailers. Race hustling is just plain repugnet make it on your own please.</p>

<p>Eww!&hellip;.THAT is going to cause a stink! I LOVE this guy!!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s bad enough that we have to endure black destruction, disruption, or endangerment of all public spaces they&rsquo;re given access to, and that we are denied admissions to colleges and denied job promotions, contracts, etc., in favor of less qualified blacks.</p>
<p>But to be asked to also CELEBRATE all that once a year is literally adding insult to injury!</p>

		<p> &#8220;The commentary refers to King as an &#8216;America-hating communist,&rsquo; a charge that is disputed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Personally I don&rsquo;t think that King was a commie per se. King was asked if he was a commie and he said he HAD studied communism and concluded that communism only created a worse situation that what had already existed.</p>
<p>I think too that most blacks might like the welfare state but not communism.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the communist lands, everyone dresses the same, no night clubs, and no one owns a car.&#8221;</p>
<p>King may have been strongly influenced by those around him that were either commie or pink at the edges, etc. And of course King made a specific point of marching in the Marquette Park area of Chi. About 50 % of the residents there were probably displaced persons [DP&rsquo;s] who had fled communism. It was if King had received orders directly to march in Marquette Park deliberately to rile the locals up, King not having an inkling even who these DP&rsquo;s were and why they were there.</p>
<p>Strange indeed!</p>

		<p>We can&rsquo;t say that MLK was a communist. We can&rsquo;t say that he was a womanizer. We can&rsquo;t say that he used hookers. We can&rsquo;t say he beat woman. All we can say is how wonderful he was. Why are all the false gods (divine or otherwise) in American all so weak, and unable to take criticism?</p>

		<p>In response to Harumphty Dumpty&rsquo;s Jan. 12 request for confirmation of the &#8220;Reverend&#8221; MLK&rsquo;s marital infidelities, these books should provide the verifiable facts you require for posting in MSM:</p>
<p>From his mistress, Georgia Davis Powers: &#8220;I Shared the Dream  &mdash;  the pride, passion, and politics of the first black woman senator from Kentucky&#8221;</p>
<p>From his close associate, the late Rev. Ralph Abernathy: &#8220;And the Walls Came Tumbling Down&#8221;</p>
<p>From biographer Des Griffin: &#8220;Martin Luther King  &mdash;  the man behind the myth&#8221; </p>
<p>And from biographer Taylor Branch: &#8220;Pillar of Fire&#8221;</p>
<p>When King&rsquo;s FBI file is finally unsealed, embarrassment will replace the adulation of a whole set of fools with all their tributes to the black &#8220;plastic god.&#8221;  </p>

		<p> Always and without exception,it is the Left which wants to silence criticism and limit free speech. The Greeley, CO case is just one among many: Conservative speakers shouted down and even threatened on college campuses, American Renaissance conventions disrupted by those determined to intimidate those with whom they disagree, demands for a return of the &#8220;fairness doctrine&#8221;   &mdash;   and the list goes on.</p>
<p> All the great men in our history have been targets of criticism   &mdash;   some justified, some not   &mdash;   at various times and places. We may not like the criticism, but freedom of speech demands that we tolerate it.</p>
<p> But Martin Luther King is always the glaring exception   &mdash;   criticize him, and you&rsquo;ve stepped on the real &#8220;Third Rail&#8221; of American politics. There are two adages that one must follow in America to avoid screaming, hateful censors: Never say anything good about Adolf Hitler; never say anything bad about Martin Luther King.</p>

<p>As we speak they are preparing to erect a monument in Washington D.C. to MLK aka Michael King, where he will be featured along  with edifices to the nation&rsquo;s most prominent statesmen (at least by popular definition), as well as tributes to America&rsquo;s veterans and fallen.</p>
<p>This man, unlike even the icons of Washington, Jefferson or Lincoln, is being made into a secular idol of politically correct perfection. With so much money and effort put into his deification by both state and corporate powers, there&rsquo;s no way the truth will ever come out. And even if it does, it will probably be a &#8220;hate crime&#8221; to even bring it up for debate.</p>

		<p>MLK&rsquo;s FBI file may become unsealed, but it will never be seen, even through a Wikileaks.  It will be &#8220;temporary unavailable due to an office move and refiling of outdated records&#8221;.   One of our heroes on The Political Cesspool opened my eyes to this fact.  He said we&rsquo;d never see the file, because before it is unsealed, it will get &#8220;lost&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wikileaks wouldn&rsquo;t release it even if they got it, because as White as Julian Assange looks, he&rsquo;s the Fabian Socialist kind of White who hates the rest of us and hopes that blacks will collapse our system so he and his elites can come in and rule the mess, just as good Keynesian salariats are supposed to.  It&rsquo;s all part of a plan, and obviously, we are the only ones on to it.  The rest of our White brothers and sisters are too busy drinking beer, making bets on sports, worrying about sports, talking about sports, watching sports, praising blacks who play sports, watching MTV, TMZ, E-News, and remaining paralyzed in anticipation of the next Snookie story, Lindsey overdose, a Paris sex tape, but at least they have regular Kardashians showing them how marrying blacks is the right thing to do if you want to be with the in crowd.</p>
<p>(AmRen should do a research project collecting the true feelings of black women when they see their most successful black men choosing White women first. There must be some good enough stuff in that sociology that will bring more of our tribe into the Race Realist camp.)</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t afford for White Humanity to see the truth about MLK and rise up in anger to throw off our Diversity Curse shackles, because doing so returns justice, freedom and liberty to us, which is something the elites just won&rsquo;t allow.<br>

		<p>The only way to maintain the current orthodoxy is to harshly punish those who dare speak out against it. That is exactly what we see happening here. MLK is a paper god who can easily be demolished unless there is a cage of censorship protecting him.</p>

		<p>KonfederateKarl, do you really think MLK&rsquo;s FBI files will ever see the light of day?  If they don&rsquo;t get a judge to seal them for another 50 years, don&rsquo;t be surprised if in the next 16 years a fire breaks out in the national archives which conveniently destroys them.</p>

		<p>Just ask our friends in Europe - &#8220;free speech&#8221; these days only really applies to &#8220;accepted&#8221; speech. Questioning various aspects of history or the politically-correct with reagrd to race, immigration, etc., can find one before a Judge or tossed in prison.

		<p>   I don&rsquo;t doubt for one minute what you say KonfederateKarl, however, we used to think the same thing about LBJ . &#8221; Just wait till those archives are unsealed,&#8221; we said . If the truth was in those archives then we must not have gotten what was in the archives . Because now we are being told all over again how great LBJ really was . <br>
  The man who ordered the fabricated Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the bombing of the North,sent tens of thousands of draftees to a questionable demise and pillaged social security to pay for budget shortfalls created by the war is now being portrayed as &#8220;the reluctant warrior.&#8221;<br>
   I keenly suspect the liberal plan to rewrite history is much more pointed, pervasive and malicious than we can ever begin to imagine . We are now officially living,&#8221;1984.&#8221; We are just cogs in a machine too big and complicated to even begin to understand . Just expendable worker ants in the global mound . </p>

		<p>One could argue that King wasn&rsquo;t really a communist, in that he was probably less concerned with strict Marxian communism that the fact that it would provide wealth redistribution to black people. Sort of like Barack Obama Sr&rsquo;s concern for &#8220;socialism&#8221; in his country.</p>

		<p>Some of you are looking forward to the MLK files finally being opened in 2027.  What good will it do?  They won&rsquo;t tell us what we pretty much already don&rsquo;t know.  And they certainly won&rsquo;t lead to a positive (in our opinion) political reaction, because the demographic damage MLK countenanced will be done.</p>
<p>As the average American of 2027 what they think of the revelation of the MLK files, and they&rsquo;ll give you a response, but it&rsquo;ll be something along the lines of &#8220;huh?&#8221; or &#8220;what are you talking about?&#8221; in Spanish, Chinese or Arabic.</p>

<p>A liberal discusses this: <br>
<a href="https://worldohistory.blogspot.com/2007/12/church-street-bombing.html" rel="nofollow">https://worldohistory.blogspot.com/2007/12/church-street-bombing.html</a><br>
<i>This is an excerpt of an on-line discussion with a fellow who was not aware of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s violent past.</i></p>
<p><i>Hi Richard</i></p>
<p><i>I too opposed Apartheid and I do not agree with the sentiments of the Springbok club at all. They do not represent my views, however I used their website as a reference as this &#8216;event&rsquo; from Mandela&rsquo;s life seems to have been downplayed or glossed over in the traditional history of the Anti-Apartheid struggle. The sources are very scarce.</i></p>
<p><i>However the fact of the matter is that the Church Street Bombing did occur - Mandela did consent to it - (he mentions this in his book). I was living in Pretoria at the time and my father&rsquo;s office was a few blocks from the site of the bombing. I remember this event very clearly. Church Street is the Yonge Street of Pretoria - the bomb went off at rush hour on a Friday afternoon to ensure maximum civilian casualties. The carnage was awful. There were many people (both black and white) who were cut to shreds by the falling glass from the surrounding buildings. Regardless of how one wishes to justify this act, it was terrible atrocity and probably didn&rsquo;t do much to advance the anti-apartheid struggle.</i></p>
<p><i>I do not believe (based on their life actions and philosophy) that neither Gandhi nor King would have consented to such violence. One does not hear of this bombing as it does not fit in with the current image of Mandela as a voice of peace. But we cannot deny the facts - it happened. Even Amnesty International would not endorse Mandela as he refused for a very long time to denounce violence.</i><br>

<p>Whether it is the deification of MLK or AA or a reluctance to report on black on white racist assaults, all of it is designed to placate blacks so they won&rsquo;t riot and/or create open conflict.</p>
<p>The powers that be want to hold on to their power, prestige and wealth.  One sure way to put all of it in jeopardy is to stop mollifying blacks.  After experiencing the riots throughout the country, the elites will do almost anything to protect their positions and assets.</p>
<p>The only problem with that is they&rsquo;re creating a climate wherein the masses know that the only way to get their voices heard and their desires catered to is to initiate violence by observing the deference given to blacks specifically to prevent violence.</p>
<p>But, blacks could very well create havoc simply because of forced austerity measures to keep governments operating and out of bankruptcy.  And, in that regard, it isn&rsquo;t just blacks that are a concern to the elites.  The entire population could well turn into a series of mobs. </p>
<p>Caving in to every black demand sets the stage for violence from every group in the country. </p>

		<p>QD is correct,  along with the other speculations that something may &#8220;happen&#8221; to destroy or lose the files in the interim.  Even if the files are revealed, the damage by then will have been done. America will be too far down the road, and will have been sufficiently transformed so that no one will really care.</p>
<p>Or, by that time, frank discussion of such matters (as MLK) will have been outlawed  as Hate Speech.  There are many possibilities. They have plenty of time yet to find ways to handle it.</p>

		<p>I agree the recordings and the reports from moles and operatives will never see the light of day. I know this because I have requested redacted files of known communists from the 40s and 50s under the FOIA. At first I was told my request would be considered, but after a run-around I was informed the files had been destroyed. As a matter of fact, the file on Obama&rsquo;s grandpaw, who was a far lefty, has been destroyed. So history will never know whether young Barry imbibed simple New Dealism or Cominternism  &mdash;    &mdash;  and that&rsquo;s the way the gubmint wants it. Yes, the FBI and other government agencies are very busy destroying documents; do you remember the strange case of Sandy Berger? Do you think that was the first time he did that?<br>

		<p>Here is the thing. MLK&rsquo;s files have already been tampered with. When they do become available they will be used to silence any and all who thought of him otherwise. The left I&rsquo;m sure has already created another file that will serve to replace the real file probably long destroyed. Just a thought. </p>

		<p>While left wing extremists in the press and their brainwashed, mind-controlled allies in academia, offer up embarrassing shrill accolades for a man of medocrity at best, the rest of us go along with it, because it&rsquo;s of no great consequence to us.</p>
<p>These same leftist oddballs do the same thing for everything black.  And the humor in it all is that they believe what they believe, because they think they&rsquo;ve reached their thinking via objective determination, when the fact of the matter is that they no more have an ability to make independent decisions than Maoists or Stlinists did years ago.  Their skewed belief systems have been hammered into their heads by years of conditioning.</p>
<p>But note one other thing in particular: These people absolutely refuse to tolerate anyone who might want to be a separatist, politically or racially.  They refuse to allow it. They require people to think as they do or they will demonize them like unruly children do, taunting others on a playground, who delight in bullying other kids because they might be different.</p>
<p>For example, didn&rsquo;t they go almost berserk when the tea party movement was first formed?  The demonization was in progress full throttle, with cries of racists, haters, stupid.   </p>
<p>They refuse to be PC freaks all on their own, they require others to be in the same mode of perverted thinking as they are.  And if they are not, there is every indication they would favor killing them if it came down to it.</p>

		<p><i>There are but two races on this planet. Elites and Peasants.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how the elites of the NWO would like you to see it:  &#8220;Race is a social construct&#8221; and other such lies they push in our faces every day.</p>
<p>You can be sure the elites do not believe this, living in 95% White areas (like the  of Supreme Purveyor of White Hate, Reverend Wright) as they do.</p>
<p>But this notion of elite vs. peasant is wrong,  profoundly wrong.</p>
<p>Humans are TRIBAL.  Let me repeat:  TRIBAL.  Humans divide themselves TRIBALLY.  Not racially or elite vs. peasant.</p>
<p>Blacks will band with blacks, hispanics with hispanics, Armenians with Armenians, Chinese with Chinese.</p>
<p>It is natural, normal and inevitable and no lie will supersede this as it is in our DNA for survival purposes. </p>

		<p>The only way to oppose the MLK juggernaut is to keep talking about what we know. Tell the kids in our families, tell friends at work and talk to classmates. Tell them that there are files and tell them of your fears they may be destroyed. Of course they will all call you crazy, but nothing as important and unorthodox as this is ever greeted with unquestioning acceptance. Oppose the MLK memorial statue and park in DC, as well. If you organize your thoughts and feelings a strong case against this man of little good and low character is easily captured. Remember-It starts with the education of kids-family-friends and coworkers.</p>

		<p>Well its a pity we wont seem those files and tapes until 2027<br>
  Cant wait to see this being spoofed into a comedy where we <br>
hear Mr Kings orgasmic cries of `were`fxxking for Jesus <br>
in between those other emotional filled words of &#8220;the promised <br>
land &#8220;and Ì have a dream` speeches <br>
 The emperor indeed didnt appear to have his clothes on <br>
at certain discreet times and wasnt afraid to express his innermost feelings amongst his many female friends and consorts.<br>
 Indeed if he was the greatest and most respected black American<br>
it really says a lot of the status and potential of their lot. <br>
 Indeed considering these supposed sexual escapades of Mr King<br>
have more than a ring of a truth can we probably  rename his<br>
most memorable speech as `I have a wet dream!&#8220;<br>

<p>Whites have been taught to judge &#8220;good&#8221; from the point of view of oppressed minorities, whichever one happens to be complaining at the moment. From the point of view of white people and white society MKjr did incalculable harm.  Most whites have totally lost the ability to have a point of view other than that approved for them by the anti-white mass media.</p>

		<p>The irony, of course, is that Glenn Beck has found the best use of MLK for our purposes.  MLK is a modern saint.  The anti-white regime has gone so far in this country that it long ago passed MLK&rsquo;s stated beliefs, to the point that it violates them.  Sounds like an opportunity to me.</p>
<p>The left has made judging people by the color of their skin into a federal, governing institution.  We should be bashing the left over the head constantly with MLK.  It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s here to equivocate or obfuscate.</p>
