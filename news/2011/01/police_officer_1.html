<h1>Police Officer Rails Against City&rsquo;s Anti-Bias Initiatives</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Lynn Thompson, Seattle Times, January 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A Seattle police officer, writing in his union newspaper, disparages the anti-bias training the city employees are required to take, and calls city leaders a &#8220;quaint socialist cabal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the headline, &#8220;Just Shut Up and Be a Good Little Socialist,&#8221; Officer Steve Pomper calls the city&rsquo;s 5-year-old Race and Social Justice Initiative an attack on American values and calls its supporters &#8220;the enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He expresses contempt for a &#8220;Perspectives in Profiling&#8221; class that department members were required to take last year to raise awareness about racial profiling, and he questions at what point he and other officers should say &#8220;Hell no!&#8221; to the city&rsquo;s attempts to &#8220;indoctrinate SPD in social justice culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>The column, appearing in the December issue of The Guardian, is renewing concerns about the culture of the police department and officers&rsquo; willingness to address racial bias.</p>
<p>Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn said the officer&rsquo;s apparent hostility to the city&rsquo;s anti-bias efforts adds to public concerns over a series of highly publicized incidents in which officers are accused of using excessive force against minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is a serious one. How widely or deeply held are these views? How do we make sure that anyone in city government reflects the values of not discriminating against people? Even one officer holding these views is not appropriate,&#8221; McGinn said by phone last week from Washington, D.C., where he attended a meeting of The United States Conference of Mayors.</p>
<p>{snip} Sgt. Rich O&rsquo;Neill, president of the Seattle Police Officers&rsquo; Guild .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. defended his members&rsquo; right to say whatever they want in the publication.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>McGinn said his office is in &#8220;active discussion&#8221; with the U.S. Department of Justice over calls by the ACLU and 34 other organizations in December to investigate &#8220;patterns and practices&#8221; of Seattle police officers&rsquo; confrontations with people of color.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The comments are &#8220;not consistent with the values of the police department or the rules of behavior the department sets for our officers,&#8221; Burgess [city councilman Tim Burgess] said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Additionally, more than 8,000 employees have taken a class based on a three-part PBS series &#8220;Race: The Power of an Illusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2008, the office conducted a survey of city-employee attitudes toward the initiative. About 30 percent of city employees responded, but just 9 percent of the police department, Harris said. He said that while more than 80 percent of all respondents said the program was important to their work, the responses weren&rsquo;t broken down by department.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Pomper joined the Seattle force in 1992, and he has written regularly for The Guardian.</p>
<p>In 2009, he earned $96,696, according to city records. He has his own website, with a picture of him on a motorcycle and a headline that identifies him as &#8220;Author/Libertarian/Cop.&#8221; He blogs regularly about police and political issues from his home in Brier, Snohomish County.</p>

		<p>One cop on the Seattle PD, and the Mayor has to squelch it as soon as possible.  If his opinions are &#8220;not consistent with the values of the police department,&#8221; then why even have a police department?  I read Pomper&rsquo;s essay, and its prose is almost to the level of being worthy of the printed issue of AR.  This paragraph was my favorite:</p>
<p><i>These initial policies always seem benign. The city compels its employees to participate in RSJI classes, and they conduct ostensibly, innocuous surveys advancing an unquestionably leftist political agenda. They attempt to make us feel comfortable with socialist and progressive terminology through repetition and saturation. The Race and Social Justice Initiative, SPD Race and Social Justice Change Team, and Race and Social Justice Survey. I&rsquo;m waiting for the Race and Social Justice Torchlight Parade and Race and Social Justice 10K Race for Social Justice. On and on it goes until, they hope, the term no longer riles us.</i></p>

WARNING, DON&rsquo;T TRY THIS AT HOME.</p>
<p>This guy can probably get away with this because he&rsquo;s union.  Cop unions are extremely powerful.  I know this kind of indoctrination is all over the place out there in America but please people, if you want to fight this stuff say, &#8220;I find this training to be anti-white and it&rsquo;s creating a hostile environment for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if you say that you might still get canned on some pretext. </p>

		<p>Let the White liberals of Seattle be mugged and murdered by their beloved minorities.</p>
<p>My sister and her husband live in Seattle.  They were moderate liberals when they moved there.  They are now raving conservatives due to the mawkish, mewling disgusting liberalism<br>
of their neighbors.</p>
<p>They are so disgusted with the Seattle schools liberal indoctrination that they sent their daughters to boarding school in England.</p>

		<p>I checked out the guy&rsquo;s article and as many related articles I could find. I hear the frustration, but frankly there aren&rsquo;t a lot of details and specifics about what so objectionable about the training. </p>
<p>I would very much like to hear the reaction of current, working law enforcement professionals to all this &#8220;social justice&#8221; indoctrination going on these days. Are they trying to foist nonsense on you that could get you killed? Or is it just useless, feel good, kumbaya stuff?</p>

		<p>10 years ago they were holdin&rsquo; high court over racial profiling in my hometown.  Besides the infamous riots, the city was subjected to a &#8220;consent decree&#8221;, a &#8220;collaborative agreement&#8221; (both enforced by Dept. of Justice), an NAACP &#8220;corrective action plan,&#8221; various &#8220;disparity studies&#8221; and an emphasis on sensative &#8220;Community Problem Oriented Policing&#8221; as a means of handcuffing the cops.  Also, local media was saturated with indoctrination programs promoting racial &#8220;healing&#8221; at the same time Af-Am blacks were securing &#8220;protected class&#8221; status written into law.</p>
<p>This is how we celebrate diversity in our larger cities.  And wherever this diversity exists you will eventually become familiar with the terms in quotation marks above.  Let&rsquo;s all welcome Seattle to the brave new real world, and show some love for its police union rep who dares to exercise his freedom of opinion.  Cincy&rsquo;s police union president was one of the very few voices of reason heard during our city&rsquo;s test by &#8220;unrest,&#8221; but he was predictably drowned out by the mobocracy.</p>

<p>But if they wear a badge, they won&rsquo;t live to be stupid for too long.  Their buddies won&rsquo;t back them up if they do.</p>
<p>I am embarrassed by the white drug addict/alcoholic, I&rsquo;m glad he was tanked until whatever wore off.  The officer is correct.  He doesn&rsquo;t belong there.  We don&rsquo;t need to make ourselves look like targets.  </p>

<p>I had to read some of the comments posting and found that at the begining they were almost all pro-free speech.  Then the other side must have got wind of it and sent in their trolls.  The things these people say!  &#8216;He can&rsquo;t say that!&rsquo; from the lefties who screech &#8216;free speech&rsquo; when talking about anythign they want to talk about.</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;social justice&#8221; has rankled me for many months until I decided to use it.  It isn&rsquo;t like &#8220;reclaiming&#8221; a slur for our name, it is simply stealing the adversary&rsquo;s slogan.</p>
<p>So, for example, being represented on the local Human Rights Commission is a matter of social justice.  Being free of slurs and stereotypes is a matter of social justice.  When re-districting comes along shortly, having the white community&rsquo;s interests taken into account is a matter of social justice.  It&rsquo;s a lot of fun to label our own agenda a matter of social justice.</p>
<p>Try it, you&rsquo;ll like it.</p>

<p>That line, &#8220;Even one officer holding these views is not appropriate&#8221; proves the officer&rsquo;s point exactly, and could easily have been lifted right out of an Orwell novel.  What a socialistic and over-bearing thing for a man, a mayor at that, to say.  THAT is, in fact, &#8220;not appropriate.&#8221;</p>

<p>So race is an illusion?  It&rsquo;s strange how the promulgators of this obvious nonsense have no trouble detecting race themselves.  Indeed, they obsess over any and all racial disparities, which would not be possible if they truly believed that race doesn&rsquo;t exist.  An affirmative action program couldn&rsquo;t be carried out if the people in charge couldn&rsquo;t determine what race a person belongs to.<br>

		<p>This guy is one of us, or close enough. He is being attacked by the mayor, a councilman, the ACLU, and 34 other organizations. That is how they operate - picking us off one at a time. Their biggest fear is for such potential leaders and activists to continue to operate and join together.  We have to develop defensive white organizations that can come to the rescue of such people. Would a couple of $million a year be enough to assemble a group and provide some guarantee of long term employment? Isn&rsquo;t there a rich guy out there, maybe who owns a sports franchise, that wants to play a real game with real consequences? Sell the team and come win the biggest bowl game of them all.</p>

		<p>Officer Steve Pomper should be allowed to express his opinions. Many in sensitive positions like his are fired if they express opinions that violate the restraints of political correctness. <br>
 <br>
However, as a government employee earning $96,696 a year he should consider that if the tax cutters have their way, he may not have a job. </p>

		<p>While I applaud Amren&rsquo;s recognition of the double standard here. I feel she was right in what she said the old guy was up to no good. She was right again when she stated he could have been robbed or killed and in this case it was in his best interest to be taken in. This assumes of coarse that he wasn&rsquo;t raped in jail. </p>
<p>She is admitting that black areas are hostile to whites by simply stating that a white person has no business in this area. Ditto that! However you do point up a gross double standare that does exist. </p>
<p>My fear is that these practices have become so commonplace that they begin to really infringe upon the basic rights of whites to maintain their own place in society as at least equals. There is a danger here these assumptions have a way of getting out of hand first it&rsquo;s taking a white guy in in a black area for his own safety. Then it&rsquo;s telling the white guy to stay away from the voting booth for his own protection. This is a little exaggerated for now but not much. </p>

		<p>Seattle is one of the most left-leaning cities on the planet, so no big surprise that the establishment there would try to go in this direction. Seattle is in King county which was originally named after one of its founders and then just a few years ago they officially re-named it after Martin Luther King Jr, which tells us all we need to know about this pinko-commie town.<br>
This cop is a hero. At least someone has been listening to Glenn Beck. </p>

<p><br>
Well there&rsquo;s your problem right there. All this &#8220;social justice training&#8221; (read: communist re-education) is based on the idea that race is nothing more than &#8220;an illusion&#8221;, rather than something real, something meaningful, something unchangeable. But race IS real   &mdash;   and nobody has more bitter personal experience with that fact than big-city police officers. </p>
<p>If the ultraliberal diversificators of Seattle&rsquo;s City Hall are having trouble convincing Seattle&rsquo;s PD that &#8220;race is just a social construct&#8221;, it&rsquo;s because the officers know all too well that City Hall is just plain WRONG. </p>
<p>Who do you think has more direct, first-hand experience with criminal blacks   &mdash;   your average beat cop, or the kind of people who make documentaries for PBS?<br>

 Yes, anti-bias is all the rage, briefly I was in an &#8220;anti-bias curriculum&#8221; co-op preschool I lasted 2 weeks, my Japanese friend lasted one month. Apparently they told her, &#8220;your child has to learn to fight&#8221; because both of our daughters were being abused by a 50 lb. boy when they both weighed 24 lbs. So this is respecting her &#8220;ethnicity&#8221;. as you know Japanese people are über polite. Noiko bailed after that episode.  </p>
<p>Since the mother was on welfare, she played the sympathy card. Fortunately, the pre-school folded over the same issue I had. The board just re-organized as another pre-school, and dumped the anti-bias teacher who was part of the deal to be &#8220;sponsored&#8221; by the local community college. I was even told &#8220;your child needs to be exposed to other types of children. &#8221; </p>
<p>It put me off, public schools, anti-biased curriculum etc. for life. It is funny because an Hispanic friend of mine from South Texas (whose father was a doctor) said the application really turned her off. The application asked us something we had experienced that had offended our ethnicity. The Hispanic friend, called Mary the mother of many ( she has two sets of twins and a single-the second set of twins were an accident when she was 43) wouldn&rsquo;t go to the pre-school, she is also a 1st grade teacher. She just said &#8220;People are people, for christ&rsquo;s sake&#8221;</p>
<p> Seattle is politically correct, the only thing is that everybody equates Political correctness with socialism.</p>
<p>But, socialist societies didn&rsquo;t allow homeless people to run around pulling knives on policemen. A drunk Native Am. was shot by a cop when he pulled a knife on him. The thing is Seattle cops won&rsquo;t enforce anything and I&rsquo;ve been threatened twice by Seattle cops when I wanted them to do something about a dog issue. They are totally useless. The press is really really victim oriented.  People are getting fed up with it. <br>
