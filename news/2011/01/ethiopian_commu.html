			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Kate Linthicum, Los Angeles Times, January 22, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Huddled beneath a large white tent, hundreds of people sang together in the early morning darkness. For hours, they repeated a single word: Hallelujah.</p>
<p>They were gathered last Sunday to mark Timket, the Ethiopian Orthodox celebration of the Epiphany. For the faithful, the holiday commemorates Jesus&rsquo; baptism in the River Jordan and his revelation as the son of God.</p>
<p>Los Angeles&rsquo; Timket celebration is the largest in the United States. It takes place over a January weekend each year in a parking lot outside the Forum in Inglewood.</p>
<p>Ethiopian immigrants flock from across the country and Canada to receive blessings from church bishops who wear elaborate beaded cloaks and full gray beards. Organizers say it may be the largest gathering of Ethiopians outside that nation in the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>The highlight takes place Sunday afternoon, when the bishops dip their crosses into a plastic pool of water and sprinkle it on the bowed heads of believers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The festival, she [Tsehay Tseghun, one of the participants] said, goes beyond religion. It&rsquo;s a chance for Ethiopians to reconnect with their friends, family and culture.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Schools and shops are closed during the weeklong festivities, she said. And there are splendid processions, in which bishops carry replicas of the Ark of the Covenant, venerated as the vessel that carried the Ten Commandments, on their heads.</p>

<p>Sounds like the Hare Krishna, who chant &#8220;Ha-re Krishna&#8221; 1, 728 times a day, keeping count on a set of beads. It is VERY boring.</p>
<p>As for this Timket, it appears to be far more Western than African.<br>

To quote a phrase my parents and other respected community elders used to use on me when I was young and too easily amused by trivia and nonsense, &#8220;Simple things amuse simple minds.&#8221; </p>
<p>Odd how you never hear that little bit of wisdom anymore. In the minds of our elites, a simple thought like &#8220;Simple things amuse simple minds&#8221; might lead to white people (FINALLY!) making the connection between black behavior and black IQ. It might awaken whites to the idea that high black imprisonment rates are due to large numbers of blacks pulling really stupid crimes for which they were BOUND to be caught. It has the potential to spread a wider awareness of the dearth of intelligence on the part of that benighted, bemusing race who are BEHIND all that undesirable, antisocial, civilization-destroying behavior. </p>
<p>And so down the Memory Hole it must go&hellip;</p>

<p>Okay I&rsquo;ll bite - there&rsquo;s no better way to &#8220;reconnect&#8221; than going back to Ethiopia. Ever notice that alot of these leeches act as if they&rsquo;re held here against their will, with no chance of leaving? </p>

		<p>They are STILL the most civilized, stable &amp; literate Africans and Orthodoxy helps them with that but it isn&rsquo;t decisive and it won&rsquo;t help them legally emmigrate to Russia, which is better of dealing with them as useful idiots to help get a foothold in Africa and an edge on China</p>

		<p>As a Russian Orthodox believer, as well as a race-realist, I&rsquo;ve always felt it appropriate and wise that there be ethnically separate branches of Orthodoxy.  I believe God, in His wisdom created the conditions for separate races at the Tower of Babel for the salvation of mankind.</p>
<p>The low-IQ Ethiopians, are &#8220;worshipping&#8221; the same way that their (more) primitive ancestors did pre-Christianity.  They are behaving as do the least intelligent blacks who whoop and holler at pentecostal services.</p>
<p>I continue to be glad that the mother church, in all her wisdom has diverse branches that are separate.  The final resurrection of the church will be soon enough for me for us all to be together.</p>

		<p>Anon #7.  I&rsquo;d rather they not be here at all.  It&rsquo;s been said that the Ethiopians are the most steady of the black Africans.  Fine, let them be steady in Ethiopia.  You can no more improve the American black by importing &#8220;steady and respectable&#8221; blacks than you can increase his IQ by putting him in white classrooms.  Canada thought they were importing higher class blacks by allowing Jamaicans in.  How did THAT work out?  Blacks are blacks the world over, and the only thing we achieve by allowing various black tribes in to our country, is to see blacks killing each other tribally HERE just as they do in Africa.  The more diversification of black tribes we import, the more we become like Nigeria, Liberia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, etc.  Bear in mind one thing:  blacks may display violence toward blacks of other tribes, but to ALL blacks of EVERY tribe, WE WHITES are the MAIN enemy and targeted victim.</p>

		<p>Re Post #6 - You got it. Orthodox Christianity nourishes ethnic identity. Individual &amp; collective salvation depend on each other, one can&rsquo;t be attained without the other, something Western converts don&rsquo;t understand. I hope that the Russian church reverses the Nikonite reforms and re-integrates with the Old Believers in my lifetime so that true Orthodoxy becomes mainstream among Orthodox Slavdom at least. And I hope the Faith gains popularity with Western nationalists instead of flakey lefties.</p>

		<p>To the Russian above (I hope the moderator allows me to retort), Christianity came to Ethiopia long before it reached Russia. I suggest you use your supposed high-IQ to study up on your history. Orthodox Christianity became the established church of the Ethiopian Axumite Kingdom under king Ezana in the 4th century through the efforts of a Syrian Greek named Frumentius, known in Ethiopia as Abba Selama, Kesaté Birhan (&#8220;Father of Peace, Revealer of Light&#8221;). Slavs by contrast converted to Christianity from the 9th century onwards, yet you have the effrontery to claim that the Slavic Russian orthodox church is more authentic? </p>
<p>Secondly, before the Ethiopians were Christians they were Jews. The Ethiopians may well have low-IQs but the Kingdom of Axum was truly magnificent. When Islam started Muhammed sent some of his followers to seek refuge with the Christian Ethiopian King (Negus). Before Mohammed was born the Western part of Arabia was briefly (for about 50 years) occupied by the HChristian Ethiopians who ruled over the Jews and Pagan Arabs. </p>
<p>Lastly, not to Labor the point but Slav peasants leave a lot to be desired. <br>

<p>I hope Jared Taylor teaches White nationalists to be a bit more humble during the conference. Through more humility and less arrogance we will achieve our aims. Through thinking and researching rather than just spouting false history (in the manner of ghetto blacks) we can build a foundation for white consciousness. </p>

		<p>Re Post #12 - Yes the Russian Orthodox Church WAS the most authentic until the 17th century, just read about Russian Old Believers http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-Believers they used original church books that Byzantine &amp; Ethiop-Oriental churches had modified through copying, less practiced in Russia. They made a Schism in the Russian Church &amp; replaced old originals with their new modified church books. FACT. Only Old Believer Russians, 10% of the people, still practice true Orthodoxy. For now</p>

		<p>Re Anonymous Poster #12 - AmRen should beware of *russophobic Neo-Con trolls* masking as WNs pigeon-holing Russian Whites as &#8216;peasants&rsquo; (like a typical 1917 Bolshevik parasite would) while praising Ethiopian Blacks on a Race Realist site. The global Slavic right prays for White Nationalism in the West and Putin&rsquo;s alliances with France &amp; Italy result in saner immigration for the latter. Why do you let the blatant russophobia pass? </p>

		<p>To the Ethiopian above in 12)</p>
<p>What does it matter when Christianity came to Ethiopia?  I made no statements about who was first.</p>
<p>I never claimed the Russian branch to be more or less authentic, only separate, and that to be a good thing. </p>
<p>Sorry, I have no plans to become more humble in my views of blacks and their  &#8220;culture.&#8221;  Axum may or may not have been &#8220;magnificent,&#8221; but today, most of Africa is a hut wasteland.  Unfortunately, the truly magnificent societies of the West are now being destroyed by the blacks in our midst, who have decided that Africa is not a great place to live.</p>
<p>I would rather be the lowest Slav peasant than any black sports superstar you could name.</p>

<p>The Slavic Orthodox churches are the direct heirs of Orthodox Christianity from the Greek Byzantinians - a church as old as the Roman Catholic branch and prior to its brutal and barbaric conquest by muslims and Turks its direct rival.</p>
