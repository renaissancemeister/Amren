			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diana Marcum, Los Angeles Times, January 1, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the age of Facebook, the ancient Hmong courtship ritual of pov pob  &mdash;  looking for true love by tossing balls with potential mates at Hmong New Year  &mdash;  is making a comeback.</p>
<p>The tradition had been losing ground to the likes of friending and picking a match off a computer screen. {snip}</p>
<p>But over the last few years the number of ball tossers at Fresno&rsquo;s International Hmong New Year festival has been growing and many young Hmong say it&rsquo;s a reaction to casual Internet interaction.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Brenda Lee, 30, a financial advisor who met her boyfriend last year playing pov pob, said modern forms of matchmaking make Hmong singles all the more eager for face-to-face relating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook isn&rsquo;t real. It makes you hungry for the old traditions. This is a chance to see the person, see if he laughs when he drops the ball. All year, people wait for the new year. They come here from the world over to play pov pob and hope for love.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Beginning in 1975, the American government resettled some Hmong in the United States. More than 150,000 Hmong have emigrated since then, including about 30,000 in California&rsquo;s Central Valley.</p>
<p>This history is made tangible during the colorful whirl of the weeklong festival which ends New Year&rsquo;s Day. Leathery old men wearing Vietnam-era U.S. Army uniforms walk past young Hmong breakdancers with swooped, choppy and multi-colored hairstyles.</p>
<p>Girls who usually favor jeans are resplendent in elaborate Hmong finery. Some wear the most traditional hat: purple and wrapped high, designed to give the face a heart shape accented by black and white checked ribbon. Others choose boxy hats topped with pink feathers, or wide brims dangling long strings of beads.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tradition for mothers to chaperone during pov pob. The tiny mothers, stunted by malnutrition before and after the war, barely reach the shoulders of their American-born, college-educated daughters.</p>
<p>Coins are sewn to the costumes of men and women. The jangling of these symbols of hope and prosperity creates a swell of sound as steady as ocean waves, audible even over the Thai dance music, Hmong rap and traditional love songs blaring from competing speakers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>In the center of the busy fairgrounds, sisters often toss the ball to each other, pretending not to notice the boys noticing them. Boys shove each other, trying to get one of their pals to make the first move and ask the girls to play. In the past it was an excuse to get close enough to woo, and it still is.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Longer life spans and divorce have added many older pov pob players.</p>

<p>And let me guess&hellip;since that time, they&rsquo;ve assimilated beautifully into the United States. What, you say they haven&rsquo;t? Must be more of that white &#8220;racism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, whites are doomed either way. If Hmong were to assimilate, whites would have &#8220;destroyed Hmong culture.&#8221; If they don&rsquo;t assimilate, whites are &#8220;preventing them full access into American society.&#8221; Either way, whites can&rsquo;t win.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;ve also gotta laugh since Safari&rsquo;s spellchecker doesn&rsquo;t know the word &#8220;Hmong.&#8221; Must be more of that white racism.)</p>

<p>I believe the point amren was trying to make in the article was that the opposition of the WN movement to the Hmong presence in America. Still, I don&rsquo;t see how an artcile about a rather pleasant festival serves the purpose. I was near a Hmong celebration of the New Year in Guizhou several years back and it seemed really jovial. I thought it was implied that the non-Hmong were unwelcome, so stayed away, but enjoyed watching from a distance nonetheless. The laughter was deafening. The Han were all with their families for the New Years celebration and besides a few stragglers arriving at the station from their factory jobs in the coast, the entire place was deserted except for the Hmong, who painted quite a lovely picture in their traditional dress.</p>

		<p>I worked with the Hmong (if that&rsquo;s how we choose to spell it) in Laos and Thailand during the Vietnam war and they were fun to be around and totally ruthless soldiers that hated the Vietnamese beyond telling. They always treated us Americans with the utmost friendship and support&hellip;I liked them very much, but not sure they belong in America. Their American born children are sometimes a paradox I guess, the guys wanna be black gangstas and the girls tend to gravitate to white boyfriends and husbands. Asian girls in general actually, in my experience and observation, tend to go for white males.</p>

		<p>Gee whiz. Let the American Renaissance staff put up the articles that THEY wish to put up.</p>
<p>It seems that every time American Renaissance has a criticle  article up about any non-European group from the Eurasian landmass, there are posters on here who want to apologize for the said group, and then accuse Amren of some sort of &#8220;close-mindedness&#8221;. </p>
<p>There was another article put up today about strange Thai traditions, and most of the comments are currently supporting the Thai people while condemning Amren&rsquo;s motives for putting it up. The same thing happened in recent months when an article was put up that was critical of the Iranians and one of their traditions, and then another one that was critical of the Tibetans.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a website that is designed for whites to be apologetic for certain minority groups.  There are millions of other websites you can go to for that. This is a website that compiles stories portraying why diversity isn&rsquo;t a good thing for white countries.</p>
<p>Some of you seem to think that the only people in the world with lower IQs than whites are black people. You are aware that the only people with higher IQs than whites, are the Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese, according to Rushton,&hellip;aren&rsquo;t you?  Everyone else, whether you like it or not, falls under the white IQ, and I feel that Amren is wise to post articles demonstrating why nonwhite groups around the world don&rsquo;t belong in white countries.</p>

		<p>A couple of comments have questioned and speculated on the motive for posting this article. I&rsquo;d like to add my speculation to the mix. The purpose of this posting was to set an example of a people retaining and returning to their heritage. More of us should do the same.</p>

		<p>What is interesting about the article celebrates an ethnic group choosing to isolate themselves. </p>
<p>if it were an article about whites courting in a traditional way, the article would be skewed differently. It would, I believe, be pushing more that it is a dying tradition whose time came and went and that today * YAY * we celebrate diversity where everyone can date, have babies and marry.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the point! <br>
Hmong celebrate their tradition and don&rsquo;t have problem with the other people getting the feeling that they aren&rsquo;t exactly invited to join. <br>
Just imagine an entirely white traditional festivity organized along the same lines and surely there would be a number of other races/ethnicities lamenting in the media that they were made to feel unwelcome due to racism rearing its ugly head&hellip;</p>

		<p>fred, what is your point?  They can set the example in their own country.  They don&rsquo;t belong in our&rsquo;s. Why is this so hard for people on here to understand? I am quite disturbed about the growing number of Asian apologists on this website.  Please read what the purpose of this website is. Are you advocating that millions of Hmong should be allowed to settle in America just because (according to you, but not the rest of us), they have a culture that is admirable?</p>

		<p>Ref. comment # 06<br>
It is useful in the face of contemporary sexual &#8220;standards&#8221; to<br>
reflect upon what a EUGENIC SEXUALITY  might be.  There is a<br>
very real sense in which the austere standards of the Victorian<br>
era would far more nearly conform to human quality control effects than the contemporary &#8220;sexual rabbit world&#8221;.  Courtship standards such as those noted in this entry would be closer to our own<br>
traditions that what has devolved.  It is eugenic-friendly to <br>
put cognitive-override (grandmother called it Will Power, folks) on the eyeball wanderings that make the juices flow.  Absent some profound abnormality in physiology, fruitful human sexual accommodation and satisfaction is not a problem in marriage.  The wisdom of traditional courtship made this valid assumption.<br>
Basing a marriage prematurely and excessively upon tree-top sexual climaxes, etc., is very very perverse in terms of tradition, if it be, nonetheless, the contemporary standard. Behavioral science and attendant technological microminiturization now make it possible on a very wide social basis to alter the primate levels of human sexuality.  Some of this is ( inadvertent to her aims ) suggested in the interesting aims of Nicole Daederone and moreso in the eccentric but fascinating applications of Tibetan meditation to human sexuality. It is likely possible to retrain / upgrade / truly<br>
sublimate human sexuality on a cultural basis  &mdash;  not on merely<br>
a restricted cult basis.  It is possible to anchor human sexuality behind the forehead and not between the ears.  For AR<br>
any reference to courtship and mating habits from any other area of the world is just seredepitously likely to be an improvement over what has become commonplace.  It is possible to reinstate a cultural standard that overrides lust and makes it possible to weave primate reflexes into marriages ushered into place, if volintarrily entered into, that have been &#8220;filtered&#8221; to accommodate a three generation pedigree for both partners, to accommodate shared values and courtesies that make the interactions of the living room, kitchen, basic to what a discliplined sexuality can weave into place in the bedroom.  I&rsquo;ve heard at AR Conferences too much locker room laughter re matters of human sexuality to feel otherwise than that this area is deserving of great<br>
emphasis and very soon.  </p>

		<p>I thing q and Fred are both right- assimilation does usually take more than one generation, not that I am condoning the Hmong. If you look at any major east coast city you will see &#8220;little Italy&#8221; &#8220;Little Berlin&#8221; ect. Most of those former enclaves rarely have anything left of the original ethnicity other than some pretty good restaurants. Since the Hmong are obviously another race it is probably safe to say that they will probably never completely assimilate- unlike Italians and Germans of former generations. </p>

<p>Listen to yourselves!  How can it be that they cannot or will not assimilate if they are taking white husbands?  The article clearly explains that the Hmong are divided on whether to keep these traditions because they are accepting Western notions of romantic love.  Amren wants to promote the belief that whites and Asians cannot successfully co-exist.  Amren does not want assimilation, but it also wants to judge foreign cultures based on universal principals.  The truth is that many aspects and subcultures of white culture also come up short by such standards.  Universal principals are fundamentally at odds with parochialism.  Don&rsquo;t forget that the Hmong are here because white capitalists in America fought a Cold War with white communists in the Soviet Union.  Some of us expect better than this from Amren.</p>

		<p>Same deal, different place.  Airheaded girls who think &#8216;it&rsquo;s for fun or true love&hellip;&rsquo; dress up for each other, hoping to hide the worst and show off the best in ten times more clothing than normal or necessary.</p>
<p>Boys who haven&rsquo;t a clue what the traditions mean do it because they have finally caught on to the fact that being Hmong buys them no privilege points on racially aware dating sights and so hope to exploit chance to &#8216;woo&rsquo; someone on the basis of being among another ethnic isolate, never realizing that the girls think they can date out of race and move up, which some can.</p>
<p>I find most Asian females to be comparitively flat personalitied and the wonderful &#8216;doll like&rsquo; immaturity gets rapidly not-so-cute.</p>
<p>So to me the real question always comes down to:</p>
<p>1.  What do they do, economically and what is it&rsquo;s effect, plus or minus for those outside their group.</p>
<p>2.  If they aren&rsquo;t interested and we&rsquo;re not interested, how long before someone realizes that ethnies which don&rsquo;t breed together are economically taking pie slices that will make each poorer in a race to highest TFR replacement?</p>
<p>Pointless to celebrate or criticize a common human silly-teen behavior when it is the genetic economics of racial demography which could the most.</p>

<p>Rufuses to assimilate? And we are meant to gauge that by a single article about a romantic cultural festival? I&rsquo;m no fan of the Hmong, but an article about their crime rates might have been more appropriate. If you were to take celebrating a festival from the homeland as a &#8220;refusal to assimiliate&#8221;, then we&rsquo;d send back the Jews for celebrating Hanukkah, the Germans for Oktoberfest, the Irish for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and so on. After all aren&rsquo;t the only &#8220;true Americans&#8221; those who were in the country at the signing of the Declration of Independence q? From your opinions on this site, I would assume so.</p>

<p>This is at least the 2nd thread today that you have criticized me. I am not an &#8220;asian apologist&#8221;. I am prowhite as anyone who has read very many of my comments on Amren should know. But I am also a reasonable man. The US invited Hmong to settle here after Vietnam. I wish they had not. And I don&rsquo;t want any more immigration. I&rsquo;m also aware that the Hmong are one group who does not live up to the stereotype of the &#8220;model minority&#8221;. But what do you want me to do about it? </p>
<p>The most important thing we can do right now is to rebuild our own heritage and community. Not pick fights with people who are minding their own business.</p>
