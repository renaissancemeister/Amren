<h1>For Minorities, New &#8216;Digital Divide&rsquo; Seen</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Jesse Washington, Miami Herald, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>When the personal computer revolution began decades ago, Latinos and blacks were much less likely to use one of the marvelous new machines. Then, when the Internet began to change life as we know it, these groups had less access to the Web and slower online connections placing them on the wrong side of the &#8220;digital divide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, as mobile technology puts computers in our pockets, Latinos and blacks are more likely than the general population to access the Web by cellular phones, and they use their phones more often to do more things.</p>
<p>But now some see a new &#8220;digital divide&#8221; emerging with Latinos and blacks being challenged by more, not less, access to technology. It&rsquo;s tough to fill out a job application on a cell phone, for example. Researchers have noticed signs of segregation online that perpetuate divisions in the physical world. And blacks and Latinos may be using their increased Web access more for entertainment than empowerment.</p>
<p>Fifty-one percent of Hispanics and 46 percent of blacks use their phones to access the Internet, compared with 33 percent of whites, according to a July 2010 Pew poll. Forty-seven percent of Latinos and 41 percent of blacks use their phones for e-mail, compared with 30 percent of whites. The figures for using social media like Facebook via phone were 36 percent for Latinos, 33 percent for blacks and 19 percent for whites.</p>
<p>A greater percentage of whites than blacks and Latinos still have broadband access at home, but laptop ownership is now about even for all these groups, after black laptop ownership jumped from 34 percent in 2009 to 51 percent in 2010, according to Pew.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Many of Twitter&rsquo;s trending topics have been fueled by black tweets. {snip}</p>
<p>This trend is alarming to Anjuan Simmons, a black engineer and technology consultant who blogs, tweets and uses Facebook &#8220;more than my wife would like.&#8221; He hopes that blacks and Latinos will use their increased Web access to create content, not just consume it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we doing with this access? Are we simply sending e-mail, downloading adult content, sending texts for late-night hookups?&#8221; Simmons says. &#8220;Or are we discussing ideas, talking to people who we would not normally be able to talk to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Simmons has made professional connections and found job opportunities through social media. But when he first started using Twitter, the first thing he looked for was other black faces to connect with.</p>
<p>&#8220;The African-American community has a built-in social layer,&#8221; Simmons says. &#8220;We tend to see other African-Americans as family. Even if we haven&rsquo;t met someone, we often refer to other black people as &#8216;brothers&rsquo; or &#8216;sisters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&#8220;The root of that probably goes back to slavery, how we had to have tight connections because the slave masters could easily break up families,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We needed that sense of family really to protect ourselves during slavery and Jim Crow. That still is woven into, oddly, the fabric of black America to this day. And I think we see this social construct online.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>He [Miguel Amador, the owner of two computer and cell-phone stores] recognizes that mobile phones are more limited than computers: &#8220;Phones are more for entertainment right now. I don&rsquo;t want to use the word uneducated, but I don&rsquo;t think (customers) are 100 percent educated on what the Internet can do in your life. They just see you can have fun on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the Latino community,&#8221; he says, &#8220;people without Internet are missing about 65 percent of the opportunities in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>For those Latinos with mobile access, their connections are often related to geography. &#8220;Most Latinos here want to communicate with each other, they have family in other places that they want to be connected to,&#8221; Amador says. &#8220;And they want to be involved in the American community. They see everyone on TV talking about Facebook and Twitter, and they want what other Americans have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet despite these forces pushing ethnic groups together online, Simmons has seen his social network expand. Only about half of his 2,834 Facebook friends are black, down from about 80 percent when he signed up in 2006.</p>
<p>The early days of the Internet were filled with visions of a Utopian space where race would disappear, famously captured by a 1993 New Yorker cartoon with one pooch sitting at a computer saying to another, &#8220;On the Internet, nobody knows you&rsquo;re a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the reality has turned out much differently, says Peter Chow-White, an assistant communications professor at Simon Fraser University and co-author of the forthcoming anthology &#8220;Race After the Internet.&#8221; He says there is &#8220;absolutely&#8221; still a racial divide online, in terms of broadband access and the ability of blacks and Latinos to make their voices widely heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you have structural inequalities in society, you cannot expect to have anything less than that on the Internet,&#8221; he says. {snip}<br>
That&rsquo;s what danah boyd found as she documented a form of &#8220;white flight&#8221; among teenagers from MySpace to Facebook in 2006-07.</p>
<p>A social media researcher for Microsoft and a fellow at Harvard&rsquo;s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, boyd interviewed teens in 17 states and spent more than 2,000 hours observing online practices.</p>
<p>She found that black youth were more likely to be on MySpace, while whites were leaving what some called MySpace&rsquo;s &#8220;ghetto&#8221; environment for Facebook. Although few white teens explicitly said they were leaving MySpace to get away from blacks or Latinos, boyd said their comments were often closely tied to race and class.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Today, Facebook has eclipsed MySpace in popularity, and Facebook says that blacks are about 11 percent of all U.S. Facebook users. But no ethnic group has increased its Facebook usage more than Hispanics, which went from about 3 percent to 9 percent of U.S. users since 2006, according to the site&rsquo;s own analysis.</p>
<p>Amador believes this trend, along with more Internet access in general, is speeding up the process of assimilation for Latinos by connecting them to their friends and families back home.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&rsquo;re far away from something, you have a strong feeling for it, and you want it more,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But now that we can get closer to those things, it makes us much more comfortable here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I can confirm this. I&rsquo;m a grown man but I was on MySpace for music promotion purposes for a few years. By 2008, MySpace was so exclusively focused on blacks you would have thought it was BET. The last straw was an ad that constantly appeared for a dating service for black men to find white women. That&rsquo;s when I switched to Facebook. </p>
<p>When I signed into MySpace a few weeks ago to delete my long dormant profiles I noticed they redesigned it and have &#8216;whitened&rsquo; it up. Still, it was too little, too late. I&rsquo;ve been on Facebook now for more than two years and I have NEVER had black-oriented material shoved down my throat. MySpace committed suicide by catering solely to blacks and thinking that whites would stick around because whites just love black pop culture. Wrong! </p>

Blacks have complained for years about not having new textbooks. As a result, they claim, they can&rsquo;t learn. The same with computers.</p>
<p>As I like to say, you can give a student a textbook but you can&rsquo;t make him read or think. <br>

<p>Apparently the cyber-world mimics the physical in that wherever large numbers of Hispanics and Blacks congregate and begin to take over, Whites are sure to head for the exits.</p>
<p>Few White teens may have explicitly stated this was their reason, but we all know that many more feel similarly, but decline or are afraid to state why.</p>

<p>I propose that we stop calling them &#8220;minorities&#8221;. Let&rsquo;s stop falling for this propaganda term and using the Left&rsquo;s vocabulary (a deceptive euphemism coined by the Swedish Marxist Gunnar Myrdal). </p>
<p>The stark fact is that in many, many cities  (and now some states) across the country they are NOT any kind of  minority.  We are. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s stop kidding ourselves about who&rsquo;s the  majority.</p>

		<p>This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me.  Sometimes I have problems with my home computer so I have to go use the public library. Every time I go, I notice that most of the computers are already taken, mostly by blacks who are just there to play games or look for music or whatever. Meanwhile someone like me comes in who really needs it. This happens with a lot of services that are given to the general public for free. Whites can hardly enjoy them anymore, because they are taken over by people who don&rsquo;t work. Meanwhile us whites foot the bill for the services to begin with. </p>
<p>Public transportation is another fine example. Does anybody ride the bus in their area anymore?  I sure haven&rsquo;t been able to do it wherever I live, and sometimes I have really needed it. Maybe it is because I live in the South, but I have noticed that every time I see one of those buses, it is filled with blacks.  Why would I, or any white female wish to get on?  The one time I did, I was harrassed!</p>
<p>We can go on and on with examples! How many whites on here still enjoy going to fairs and amusement parks??????</p>

		<p>Sheesh.  The black illegitimacy rate is 70%, there is a high degree of functional illiteracy among blacks, and black crime rates are sky high, so what do the libs do?  Fret about the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;.</p>

		<p><i>But now some see a new &ldquo;digital divide&rdquo; emerging with Latinos and blacks being challenged by more, not less, access to technology. </i> </p>
<p>Differences always emerge when you look at the races as groups. The excuse is, &#8220;Well, members of a particular race are not all that way,&#8221; whatever &#8220;that way&#8221; is referring to. True  enough, but when you look at the races as groups, the same patterns always emerge. And that&rsquo;s what the study of group differences is, observing patterns among groups.</p>
<p><i>A greater percentage of whites than blacks and Latinos still have broadband access at home, but laptop ownership is now about even for all these groups, after black laptop ownership jumped from 34 percent in 2009 to 51 percent in 2010, according to Pew.</i></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an amazing jump, and so laptop ownership among all the races is now equal? That&rsquo;s a notable trend, as computers have gotten easier and easier to use, but can we now expect to see a new wave of black computer programmers emerge? Ah, no, I&rsquo;m afraid not, as we are told that blacks suffer from a lack of &#8220;role models&#8221; in the programming community.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The root of that probably goes back to slavery, how we had to have tight connections because the slave masters could easily break up families,&rdquo; he says.</i></p>
<p>And how did that &#8220;built-in social layer&#8221; cause blacks to sell each other into slavery in the first place, as was pointed out by our friend and Obama beer summiteer Henry Louis Gates Jr.?</p>
<p>Blacks are always portrayed as the poor hapless victims of social forces beyond their control, a sort of patronizing attitude towards blacks that is in itself quite &#8220;racist.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;As long as you have structural inequalities in society, you cannot expect to have anything less than that on the Internet,&rdquo; he says.</i> </p>
<p>Structural inequalities in society? Notice the permanence of that. The structure of a building is what holds the whole thing up.  Apparently the only way to dismantle these &#8220;structural inequalities&#8221; is to dismantle all of society.</p>

		<p>Uneducated people are easily identified because they type as they speak.  For instance, I axed a question versus I asked a question.  Illiterate is what it is whether in text or voice.  They refuse to learn in order to protect their heritage and force teachers to abandon white students that want to learn.    </p>

<p>So, even in a piece about computers and high technology, blacks just have to include talking points about Jim Crow and slavery, and by extension, the white devil masters. </p>
<p>I think Mr. Simmons should stay on the topic - which is why blacks seem to use the internet mainly for entertainment, for surfing adult web sites, and for hook-ups (and, it seems lately, for flash mob formation).<br>
 <br>
In other words, why are blacks not taking advantage of the vast potential the internet has for learning and free expression and career advancement and so on?</p>
<p>This is the same root issue that plagues blacks in all areas of American life - just wrapped in a different package. The article, like so many others, runs in circles searching for an answer that is obvious.</p>
<p>Here you have a race of people with an average IQ of 85 and no cultural connection to education or learning. They have no study habits or literacy skills. They are genetically limited in logical thinking. They cannot even graduate from the worst high schools. Of course they are going to use the internet for games and hook-ups. Anything more is too great an intellectual challenge.</p>
<p>Worse, another individual in the article is quoted as saying, &#8220;As long as you have structural inequalities in society, you cannot expect to have anything less than that on the Internet.&rdquo; </p>
<p>How lame is that remark? It seems blacks can come up with excuses for anything - excuses usually framed in some form of discrimination. What a bogus statement! </p>
<p>With a computer and an internet connection, everyone is equal. What you do with the connection is up to the individual.</p>
<p>And by the way, the wheels are coming off at MySpace - which is owned by News Corp. Almost half of its workers were just let go and revenue is crashing. Even in the virtual world - when blacks move in the whites move out and the place goes to pieces.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;We tend to see other African-Americans as family.</p>
<p>Oh, I guess that&rsquo;s why so many of this group can do without those smaller families that begin with a man and a woman getting married.</p>
<p>And considering how many children some black males are fathering today by different women, &#8220;other African-Americans&#8221; sometimes may actually BE &#8220;family.&#8221;</p>
<p>(From a 2006 Washington Post article entitled, &#8220;&#8216;Marriage Is for White People&rsquo;&#8221;:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, no,&rsquo; objected one student. &#8216;We&rsquo;re not interested in the part about marriage. Only about how to be good fathers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when the other boy chimed in, speaking as if the words left a nasty taste in his mouth: &#8216;Marriage is for white people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 2001, according to the U.S. Census, 43.3 percent of black men and 41.9 percent of black women in America had never been married, in contrast to 27.4 percent and 20.7 percent respectively for whites.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another useful tidbit from that article:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was stunned to learn that a black child was more likely to grow up living with both parents during slavery days than he or she is today, according to sociologist Andrew J. Cherlin.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Amador believes this trend, along with more Internet access in general, is speeding up the process of assimilation for Latinos by connecting them to their friends and families back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assimilation?  Assimilation means that the U.S. is your home, not Mexico.<br>
That&rsquo;s the point: this is not their home, just a place to get money, preferably without working.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t pay taxes you should not vote.  Otherwise we get the people who contribute nothing voting themselves benefits from the rest of us.</p>

		<p>I live in a rural SE Ohio county in a region that&rsquo;s only about 4% black.  About two years ago, the computers of the county&rsquo;s few libraries became cluttered with blacks  &mdash;  especially men  &mdash;  who appeared to be engaged in pursuits causing a high level of emotion.  I wondered if they were gambling online, but I suppose any kind of interchange may have engendered excitement or frustration.  <br>
Before all this began occurring, the computers were open to all, without time limits.  A user merely signed up, and people were asked to relinquish use only if someone else needed a computer and all were already in use.  Then, a strict rule was formulated requiring a library card and computer-generated time restriction.  Now, I scarcely ever see a black patron in the county&rsquo;s libraries.</p>

		<p>Courtney, you are so right!  I live in Southern California, home of several amusement parks, and with the kind of weather where they can stay open all year long.  Last time I was at an amusement park, my friend and I were in this underground area in a very long line for a roller coaster.  I looked around and she and I were just about the only Whites!  I shuddered to think of a riot or wilding happening in that underground area.  I&rsquo;ve pretty much stopped going to amusement parks (an activity I used to greatly enjoy.)  White friends who still go tell me of blacks pushing and shoving and blatantly cutting in line, while Whites are afraid to speak up for fear they&rsquo;ll be beaten, accused of &#8220;racism,&#8221; or whatever.  Yet the media constantly tell us that Whites are the evil, vicious aggressors and blacks the poor, miserable, cowering victims!  It&rsquo;s the other way around.  This has been going on for years and years and years.  Back in the late &rsquo;40s, my parents could no longer go to the local amusement park in their city because it had been taken over by violent blacks.  Soon afterwards the place shut down.  </p>
<p>How long are whites going to put up with this?  When will we stand up and demand that Blacks stop ruining everything nice, whether it be a web site, an amusement park, or anything else?</p>

		<p>Prior comments echo my view that the article&rsquo;s information content is low, muddled, and laced with Liberal propaganda. However, it also seems to reflect an unease that the liberals have toward the internet. The internet allows different groups to mass communicate with one another without external supervision by governments or NGOs. Blacks can &#8220;be theyselves&#8221;, and so can those who have nonPC views regarding blacks. I don&rsquo;t think either makes the liberals happy.</p>

		<p><i>But the reality has turned out much differently, says Peter Chow-White, an assistant communications professor at Simon Fraser University and co-author of the forthcoming anthology &ldquo;Race After the Internet.&rdquo; He says there is &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; still a racial divide online, in terms of broadband access and the ability of blacks and Latinos to make their voices widely heard.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as you have <b>structural inequalities</b> in society, you cannot expect to have anything less than that on the Internet,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Structural inequalities&#8221; &hellip; on the Internet? A &#8220;racial divide&#8221; that keeps blacks and Latinos from making &#8220;their voices widely heard&#8221;? I&rsquo;d hazard to guess there&rsquo;s never been a medium more open to participation by all groups than the Internet. People like this whiner are likely upset over the fact that with the Internet there&rsquo;s no one forcing everyone to listen to black and Latino complaints. </p>
<p>As far as lack of broadband access being the culprit, you can &#8220;hear&#8221; me, can&rsquo;t you? Yet, where I live (in the hinterlands) there is no broadband access either. </p>

		<p>Most of us prefer segregation. Why wouldn&rsquo;t we have natural cybersegregation? It makes perfect sense to me. </p>

		<p>&#8220;He says there is &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; still a racial divide online, in terms of broadband access and the ability of blacks and Latinos to make their voices widely heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they say something like this, what they are really saying is that they want white people to listen to blacks and latinos, take them seriously, adopt their mannerisms and concerns and do what they want.</p>
<p>Blacks and latinos have zero problems having their voices heard in their respective communities.  Why should they care about the dwindling numbers of whitey, especially since most blacks and latinos have next to no interactions with whites?  There are whole sections of the country where a white face is a rare thing in daily life for many of them.</p>
<p>I would say the real disparity is that most latinos scoop up black culture like it was tortillas, but blacks pay zero attention to latino culture and concerns.</p>
<p>Because whites, even liberal ones, generally know instinctively that they have more advanced cultural patterns, it is hard for any of us to really take black and latino, even asian, concerns to mind.  </p>
<p>Do I care if blacks, latinos or Asians like me or want to network with me?  No.  Why should they care?  Let them network with each other.  Asians over here have more money than most of us anyway.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading books that contain hundreds of pages, thinking about space travel or going to a museum to learn something new.  Why would I care about the latest escapades of a gangsta rapper, the &#8216;vibrancy&rsquo; of some instrument made from a gourd or the revolutionary rantings of a welfare recipient who is not satisfied with all the freebies she&rsquo;s getting?  </p>
<p>Anyway, I can confirm what others have said.  Where I&rsquo;m at, the blacks and latinos use the internet for only 3-4 activities: music videos, social networking, porn vids and looking at high top shoes or grafitti sites.  I have seen this from close contact through working with them for many years now.  </p>
<p>I have never seen a black or latino going to any kind of website with intellectual, financial or political content.  It is not my fault, and no one can argue otherwise - at least with a straight face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anybody ride the bus in their area anymore?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not me. I&rsquo;ll ride the bus in some parts of San Francisco, but I don&rsquo;t get on ANY bus in Berkeley anymore.</p>
<p>The last straw for me happened several years ago, the day I had returned from a wonderful summer in Mexico.* I was feeling very expansive, and thinking to myself, I can be happy here in Berkeley, it&rsquo;s not really such a bad place, etc. etc. I got on a bus, and in a few moments a black climbed on, cursing all the whites in the world loudly in the vilest way, over some experience he had apparently just had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ashamed to admit that I didn&rsquo;t stand up and curse him right back, whatever the risk, it makes me so angry to even recall the occasion. I silently got off the bus in a rage, and after that moment my trip to Mexico might as well have never happened, for all the good it did me. I was right back into feeling all contracted and angry.</p>
<p>Just another snapshot of living-with-blacks, and here&rsquo;s another local bus story:</p>
<p>As a black woman exited the back door of an Oakland bus a few years ago, she suddenly turned and spat right into the face of a white woman friend of mine who was in the seat right behind the back door. My friend was stunned, and finally turned around to the man behind her and said, &#8220;That lady who just go off spit in my face.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I don&rsquo;t think so.&#8221; My friend said, &#8220;Yes, she did.&#8221; The man said something like, &#8220;If you don&rsquo;t like jazz, then you shouldn&rsquo;t visit jazz clubs.&#8221;<br>
At that point my friend noticed that she was the only white person on the bus.</p>
<p>*Among other pleasures, trips to Mexico took my mind off race back when I was even more obsessed than I am now. But that last stay in a very out-of-the-way Mexican village&hellip;all the guys had worked up here and wanted to vent their feelings to me about the U.S. blacks they had encountered while here! Putting aside the whole Mexican question for a moment, Mexicans have a very strong system of courtesy, and they just can&rsquo;t fathom the &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior of so many of our blacks.</p>

		<p>Many of the Boston-area university libraries have had &#8220;public&#8221; computers intended for serious visitors to look up call numbers and do a few research-related searches.  Most at Boston University are now gone, or available only with librarian help, due to misuse by black slackers and homeless types (often smelly).  Northeastern University&rsquo;s engineering library still has some banks of poorly supervised terminals, typically in use by unaffiliated black males who spend hours logged in to girlfriend and matchmaking sites (there is no time enforcement and little checking by the busy library staff).  If you ever need to go there, hold your nose. </p>

		<p>Okay bus riders, I haven&rsquo;t used public transport for a few years, only cause I moved away from King County.  Now that&rsquo;s a metro that has its share of blacks.<br>
You just gotta learn a few tricks to avoid interaction with blacks, and one is to NEVER sit in the back of any bus (like poster 24&rsquo;s friend did).  Do not ever break this rule.  <br>

		<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in our society that&rsquo;s as free as the internet, under many definitions of the word &#8220;free.&#8221;  And you can&rsquo;t blame anyone but yourself for the way you spend your time using this tool.</p>
<p>When my wife is using our computer and I don&rsquo;t feel like waiting I use my PlayStation 3 to access the internet.  It&rsquo;s a little more cumbersome than a computer when you use the controller to navigate but you can buy a keyboard if you want to use it to surf on a more regular basis.  </p>
<p>Any black or brown that owns a PS3 or any of the other latest-generation game systems (and very many do) can use it to access the internet.  They can access sites like the Khan Academy, an EXCELLENT educational resource that is free of charge.  But they don&rsquo;t.  They&rsquo;d rather play Madden or Call of Duty.  I just really don&rsquo;t see how they can blame this on The Man.</p>

		<p>Why Facebook is popular with Whites while Myspace is popular with Blacks and Mexicans?</p>
<p>Myspace was originally popular with all races.  Facebook added advanced features which prompted a move from Myspace to Facebook of all users who appreciated more sophisticated features  &mdash;  Whites &amp; Asians.  However, blacks content with a more remedial social networking tool stayed satisfied at Myspace.</p>

<p>I used to get upset over comments like this on here, but it is becoming more and more obvious to me that this is a white liberal troll posing as an Asian.  I mean, look at the name (an  Indian sounding name, Chinese sounding name, and then a Thai sounding name).</p>
<p>I would hope most Asians would know better than to come on a website like this and brag about such a false claim. Thank white people for letting the cream of the crop of their people come here and compete with us, and also thank white people for inventing computers and most of everything related to them. &#8220;Asian-white divide&#8221;&hellip;.don&rsquo;t make me laugh.</p>
<p>Other than that, I like all the other comments above. The stories people shared in response to my post about riding buses, going to parks, and using public libraries, were very insightful, as were many others.</p>

<p>this happened all over teh country in the 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s.  There were thousands of inexpensive amusement parks in and near cities accessible by public transport.  Once the blacks started going the whites were driven out and the parks closed.  One of the reasons Disneyland, Great America, Six Flags etc are so expensive is to keep the worst of the trash out.</p>
<p>Another example of how everyone else has to suffer because of black behavior.  I understand magic Mountain in S. California has just about been taken over by hispanic thugs.<br>
