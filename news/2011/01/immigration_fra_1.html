			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Economic Times (India), January 26, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Hundreds of Indian students, mostly from Andhra Pradesh, face the prospect of deportation from the US after authorities raided and shut down a university in the Silicon Valley on charges of a massive immigration fraud .</p>
<p>The Tri-Valley University in Pleasanton, a major suburb in San Francisco Bay Area, has been charged by federal investigating authorities with being part of an effort to defraud, misuse visa permits and indulge in money laundering and other crimes.</p>
<p>According to a federal complaint filed in a California court, the University, which was raided and shut down last week, helped foreign nationals illegally acquire immigration status.</p>
<p>The university is said to have 1,555 students. As many as 95 per cent of these students are Indian nationals, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Investigations by Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) found that while students were admitted to various residential and online courses of the university and on paper lived in California, in reality they &#8220;illegally&#8221; worked in various parts of the country as far as Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Texas.</p>
<p>ICE has called it as a &#8220;sham university.&#8221; The ICE investigations found that more than half of these students were reported to be residing in a single apartment located in Sunnyvale California.</p>
<p>During the course of the investigation ICE found that the university gave the residential address of its students in order to conceal that they did not live in California, said the court papers.</p>
<p>For a student to maintain an active immigration status, they must show proof that they are making reasonable process towards completing coursework and physically attend classes.</p>
<p>Federal investigating authorities are now sweeping out on each of those students, who paid lakhs for obtaining students visa and also students work permit.</p>
<p>Several of them have been interrogated, creating a panic reaction among the Indian student community.</p>
<p>Many of the students from Andhra Pradesh, who were planning to join the university for the new semester, have cancelled their US travel plans.</p>
<p>Classes were scheduled to start on January 10 after the winter break.</p>
<p>It is understood that many of these students are planning to leave the country as soon as possible as they are being interrogated.</p>
<p>There are unconfirmed reports of some of the students being detained and deportation process has been started against them.</p>
<p>Once the university has been shut down, the students who come on F-1 visa, lose their status within a stipulated time. These students have been making desperate calls to Indian- American immigration attorneys.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have received verification that ICE has detained some of the students and placed them in removal proceedings,&#8221; Murthy Law Firm, a popular immigration attorney firm among Indian-Americans, said in a posting on its website.</p>
<p>On January 20, 2011 the Murthy Law Firm received numerous phone calls from students registered at Tri-Valley University in Pleasanton, California, it said in its posting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the F-1 Tri-Valley students may have options to try to change status in the United States. Some are potentially eligible to request a change to H-4 or other dependant statuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Others might be eligible for H1B status through employers, but may not have enough time to file for the soon-to-be reached FY 2011 H1B cap. Those who have previously held H1B status and do not need cap numbers would not face this problem,&#8221; advised the Murthy Law Firm.</p>
<p>Tri-Valley University, on its website, says that it is a Christian Higher Education Institution aiming to offer rigorous and excellent quality academic programmes in the context of Christian faith and world view. It offers a wide range of courses.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, the university and its founder Susan Su have made millions of dollars in tuition fee for issuing visa-related documents that enabled hundreds of foreign nationals to obtain illegal student immigration status.</p>
<p>Calls were made to various telephone numbers listed on the Tri Valley website but either the voice mail box was full or the number was not accepting any new calls.</p>
<p>According to the court document, ICE began its investigations in May 2010.</p>
<p>In February 2009, the university received necessary permission to issue visas for 30 students and in May that year it had some 11 active students who had F-1 visas.</p>
<p>The number jumped to 939 by May 2010.<br>

		<p>Something Americans will have to learn (and apparently the British still haven&rsquo;t learned after 300 years of dealing with East Indians), is that East Indians are probably the most cunning people on Earth and will, inevitably, beat any silly hidebound bureaucratic rules imposed by flabby-minded and flabby-bodied western politicians and officialdom.</p>

		<p>The article has a distinct pity-the-poor-Indian-students flavor.  When someone starts writing about the hordes of Indians who <i>weren&rsquo;t</i> involved in this particular scam but continue to pour in, then I&rsquo;ll be interested.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Tri-Valley University, on its website, says that it is a Christian Higher Education Institution.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t be at all surprised if this is true.<br>

		<p>This is a popular scam across the Western world.  </p>
<p>In Britain, many of these fake schools were caught and exposed as fronts for criminals selling British visa applications.</p>
<p>In Canada, one such fake mosque/university was actually a restaurant in a small rural Ontario town.</p>

		<p>After reading this, no one should have any doubt that the Hindus and Sihks in America are actively paricipating in perpetuating  post-1965 immigration policy which if allowed to continue will result in the rapid race-replacement of the current Native Born White Majority street by street,town by town,state by state by state.  Post-1965 nonwhite immigrants are in fact repsonsible for the continuation post-1965 immigration policy. Blame the immigrants.</p>
<p>There is absolutetly no economic,ecological-environmental and demographic reason for importing even one Hindu into America&hellip;.there never was&hellip;</p>
<p>If anyone thinks for one micro-second that the Hindus in America will implement  a race neutral-Golden Rule immigration policy when Native Born White Americans are a rapidly dwindling racial minority&hellip;you will have given new meaning to the term &#8220;delusional&#8221;. When the Hindus become in charge of &#8220;America&rsquo;s&#8221; immigration policy it will completely exclude Europeans and make 100 percent  certain  racial minority status for Native Born White Americans&hellip;.permanently.</p>
<p>How did Native Born White America manage to survive when there was  hardly any Hindus in America? Very well thank you&hellip;and that&rsquo;s a fact.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t put your family&rsquo;s fate in the hands of the Hindus in America&hellip;and the Hindus who want to come to America legally.</p>

In 2008 and 2009 we imported 490,000 indians with fake degrees on the H-1B visa</p>
<p>Since 2000 we have imported 1.5 million</p>
<p>Since 1990 we have imported 3 million</p>
<p>There are only 4 million technology jobs in america</p>
<p>This means we have sent our best and brightest americans to the death camps</p>

		<p>Whomever posts such comments as the Hindus taking over and such is NOT paying attention to the muslim threat! The muslims murder hundreds of Hindus every month in India and they will do the same to the Hindus in America and to Christians in America. We cannot threaten the muslims with prison, deportation, death or anything else because that is what they want, that is what will get them to heaven! SO! the only way to deal with muslims is to send them to allah and their chosen paradise before they can detonate themselves in crowds of people. This conduct IS COMING to America and it is gonna be ugly, and for those of you who have never seen it, get ready for a real shocker! but also, get used to it as long as we have ONE muslim in America because the threat will remain as long as that ONE muslim is alive!</p>

		<p>I had just read and commented on the Indian Northrop engineer who sold stealth technology to the Chinese and then read this and found that the same comment applies: The model minority strikes again. Such is the depressing regularity of these stories about Chinese and Indians in White countries. More insidious than blacks or mestizos in the long run. </p>

		<p>Indians irritate me more than any other nonwhite ethnic group. They have been elevated to a status and reputation that they haven&rsquo;t even earned yet. Just because a small minority of them are brainiacs, that hardly means most Indians in the general population over there will add anything of value to Western culture. If you want to import multitudes of Indians, guess what you get?: INDIA.</p>

		<p>Mike from not-Queens, you are 100% correct.  Indians and especially East Asians are a bigger threat to white society than black people or Amerindians.  Unlike those groups they live quietly and commit crimes that undermine systems which the public does not have great interest in so the crimes can go on for years unnoticed.</p>

The English word thug is derived from the Indian word Thag meaning con man or killer.<br>
The Thugee cult traveled in groups and dispatched their victims by creeping up behind them and strangling them with a garotte.</p>
<p>The Indian Thugee cult was active for centuries because Indians didnt have the knowledge to determine the cults tactics and veiled their fear in religoius superstition.</p>
<p>When British civil servant William Henry Sleeman arrived on the scene in the 1830&rsquo;s, he used police profiling and intelligence methods to ultimately render the Thugee extinct within a matter of decades.</p>
<p>This story makes known alot about the true character of Indians especially in relationship to illegal immigration.</p>
<p>Not only that, but their decision making abilities, or lack of, seem to be rooted in pantheism.<br>
Indians believe that the material world and God are the same.</p>
<p>What should concern whites about Indians is that in addition to being lewd by nature, they also pursue whites for sex with uncommon alertness.</p>
<p>If American&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t place a plug on illegal immigration, the effects of the browning of our country will be worse than losing a war by an atomic bomb.</p>

		<p>As someone who lived and worked in Silicon Valley (and I used to work in Pleasanton, CA many moons back), I have seen the Indian fraud first hand. We are flying in 100,000 of these people a month, nearly none of whom have ever even seen a lightswitch, and we are giving them our best $100K+ a year tech jobs, just because that is what they want. These people are incompetent and are destroying our companies. After they get trained by Americans who invented IT, they kick the Americans out. Then the companies collapse. Microsoft employs over 35,000 of them and has gone from a $100/share stock to $28. Meanwhile Apple, which still hires mostly Americans and which CLOSED its R&D; in India in 2006 is BOOMING and the stock is $325+.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>

		<p>It seems that SKIP is playing the old game theory game of &#8216;let&rsquo;s you and him fight&rsquo;&hellip; Hindus dying overseas are not our concern. Once we leave Muslim countries MAYBE the Indians can use all that wealth that they&rsquo;ve vacuumed out of our economy to fight their own battles.</p>
<p>Personally, we had (minor) Muslim problems before 9-11, we&rsquo;ll always have those problems. And as soon as we (Americans) rid ourselves of this so-called &#8216;War on Terror&rsquo; and get back to focusing on our OWN PEOPLE, the better we&rsquo;ll be in the long term.</p>
<p>The world can live without the policeman for a few years. If the Muslims take some heads overseas because our Indian friends can&rsquo;t police themselves properly or defend against China EVEN NOW that should not be our problem.</p>

		<p>And Obama wants more visas and green cards for these job stealers.<br>
America needs to innovate from within..with heavy unemployment the government should cancel the following visas: H1-b, L1, OPT, EB1, EB2 and EB3 which allow foreigners to take American jobs. That&rsquo;s one way we can promote economic growth. <br>
All I have to say is: the politicians that dreamed up NAFTA, CAFTA, and the like including outsourcing must have had rocks for brains to have ever thought those things would be good for our country. How in the world (no pun intended) could fair trade (what a joke) with all those other countries be good for us!!! It was the beginning of unemployment when those things were voted in. Our companies took off for the cheap labor, and our people lost their jobs. Personally, I would rather pay more for things and have Americans employed than to have cheap products from China that don&rsquo;t hold up for long anyway!!!!</p>
<p>Why is our government STILL bringing in 1.5 MILLION foreign workers a year?http://www.americanworker.org/ The vast majority of foreigners here on guestworker visas are ordinary white collar workers with common skill sets. Why, why, why????</p>

<p>More seriously, it is too bad the media is at one with the government (and much of the business world) in opposing any real restriction of immigration. This will likely result in our never finding out what becomes of these &#8220;students&#8221;.  I bet the vast majority are never deported either because they hire effective immigration attorneys or because there is no long term ICE detention and follow thru so that they just fall thru the cracks.</p>
<p>BTW the SF Chron and San Jose Mercury News (the 2 major newspapers in this area) didn&rsquo;t cover this story at all so far as I saw.</p>

		<p>A fake school to bring foreigners over here is nothing compared to the massive fake training and placement industry to send them over here that&rsquo;s ginned up in India over the past decade. </p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m looking back on the SOTU address, and for all that I can tell, the President basically told American workers to go to hell and die there. But in more flowery, and more empty language. They were told to &#8220;reinvent&#8221; themselves - in what direction? More training and degrees? But that&rsquo;s already not working, because the infinite hoards of Indians will merely claim better and more recent credentials (true or not, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter to the pointy-haired bosses). And, the working class has already been hit by the &#8216;more education will save you&rsquo; scam, and hundreds of thousands of them are already walking around with credentials that a) haven&rsquo;t gotten them the job they were supposed to, b) generated gigantic student loan debt (in some cases exhausting their eligibility or producing a student loan default).</p>
<p>Green jobs? China is grabbing them. Technology? India and China. So, what&rsquo;s an American supposed to do? Obama just told them they were being thrown to the international wolves. We thought we were living in interesting times before &hellip;.</p>
<p>Just what the hell is an American supposed to do for a living in America any more? </p>

<p>You got it right and you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. Where I used to live in Richmond Hill (hence the moniker. I used to post here as Mike from Queens) and in Jackson Heights they took over the neighborhoods and trashed them like you would not believe.  Those single-family houses were so overcrowded that fires were a regular event (started frequently by their religious candles as well as illegal wiring). I once saw a mother-daughter house (really small, which is why they call it that) with no less than four satellite dishes on it. Like Indians in your workplace? By all means let &#8216;em show up on your doorstep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike those groups they live quietly and commit crimes that undermine systems which the public does not have great interest in so the crimes can go on for years unnoticed&#8221;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it in a nutshell. Blacks and Hispanics out themselves but these people are fake polite (until they are the majority) and charm unsuspecting liberals. They even had some movie once where some Indian guy became some sex guru and seduced white girls, with Heather Graham I think. Of course he was the reluctant hero and the only one capable of giving these women true love. Propaganda at its finest.</p>

<p>I had many of the same reactions.  But my mind ran in a slightly different direction   &mdash;   I got out my calculator and figured that there are around 51 million working age white people in this country whose IQs are between 85 and 100, lowish-average for white standards.  They can do a lot of good things, and in the right sociopolitical system, can have a good standard of living, and see their own improve over their lives and across the generations of themselves, but I can assure you that not one person in the upper 80s and anywhere in the 90s of IQ range will perfect quantum computing, interstellar space travel or cure cancer.</p>
<p>Obama (and too many Republicans) is (are) condemning them to permanent poverty and peasanthood.</p>

<p>Now listen carefully to me a******.. dont just bark around in the corner like a rabies stricken stray dog about your pathetic views about politics and jobs. If your insecure about your skills and abilities thats your f****** problem not Indians or any other politicians.. Well you want me to provoke you well then hear this, we are gonna take all your jobs away.. we gonna make sure that you dont even have money to buy s*** and eat, we gonna take evrything thatwas yours.. we gonna drape the Statue of Liberty with a saree (you dont know wahta saree iis, well its a dress which Indian women wear).. now get your f****** stinking face out of here A******!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>These people are here to rob and plunder us, not to help us. Based on the state of the economy, I&rsquo;d say they&rsquo;re doing a pretty good job of it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right - and, I would add, not just the IQ&rsquo;s between 85 and 100. If yours is higher, but you foolishly invested your education and career in an area that India or China, or some other country decides to covet, you are also economic toast. The hypercompetitiveness generated by unease among the still-employed has made it much harder to get interviews and change careers than it used to be even a few decades ago. We are ALL sitting ducks for globalism, now that our government has officially opened the floodgates. America simply doesn&rsquo;t have enough jobs to satisfy India or China, even if they fired ever single one of us and forced us to train our foreign replacement, which has happened to hundreds of thousands of American technology workers over the last decade. And don&rsquo;t forget the USAid scandal where they were using taxpayer money to train workers in several countries to take over work outsourced from America. </p>

		<p>Here is a follow-up showing how shameless their attitude is: http://goo.gl/Y27ph</p>
<p>Do we really want more people with this sort of ethics in America? Don&rsquo;t we have enough grifters and victim-cryers already? </p>

		<p>&#8220;Indians irritate me more than any other nonwhite ethnic group. They have been elevated to a status and reputation that they haven&rsquo;t even earned yet. Just because a small minority of them are brainiacs, that hardly means most Indians in the general population over there will add anything of value to Western culture. If you want to import multitudes of Indians, guess what you get?: INDIA.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when people can&rsquo;t compete, they look to vilify the those who can.  Instead of focusing your energy on abusing a successful immigrant group, your interests will be better served if you work hard and upgrade your skills.  Skilled, motivated and resilient whites have little problem in achieving the American Dream, even in these challenging economic times.   </p>

		<p>  In my academic experience Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi students are the biggest Student Visa Jumpers. I know of few who have ever returned to their home countries after graduation. Most will try to get any sort of job in the United States. I remember overhearing, years ago, a conversation between an attractive Brazilian student and a female Indian student: the Brazilian girl said she was returning to Brazil to marry her boyfriend. Her Indian friend went wild and shouted &ldquo;Are you crazy!!!&rdquo; You must be totally crazy!!!&rdquo; Such is the cultural and economic miracle these South Asian students are anxious to return to after graduation. </p>

<p>EXCELLENT list of Indians who use and abuse our generous laws.<br>
Please note the following INDIAN CRIMINALS who thought they could get away with shareholders money.The worst part is all the Indian propaganda the US media here uses to promote these crooks and criminals. From Fox news to Newsweek, these Indians have infested and taken over these news groups and always cover for their own!</p>
<p>- VIKRAM PANDIT - CITIGROUP CEO who is under indictment in India for illegally siphoning millions of dollars in shareholders money to personal accounts for him and other executives - yet why is he NOT arrested and tried here in the USA? His biggest supporters are those Indian lovers in our Congress such as Senator Cornyn of Texas whose accepting mega millions in campaign money as head of the chairman of the Senate India Caucus. <br>
- Former CEO&rsquo;s of United Airlines and US AIR, both who were Indians and bankrupted these two airlines while living the high life off the backs of employees who were laid off by these two criminals.</p>
<p>Satyam and hundreds of such Indian owned IT companies who are spying on our government and bringing in illegals taking away jobs from our young people.</p>
<p>Now to add insult to injury, 2 Indian Governors, 1 of whom is Jindal who puts on this Billy Bob boy act to win over Lousianans - yet we all know the guy is Oxford, Harvard educated and can&rsquo;t Bar-b-Q  anything then a veggie burger.</p>
