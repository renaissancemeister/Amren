<h1>Anti-Violence Speaker Charged With Domestic Battery in Tinley Park</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Ashley Rueff, Chicago Tribune, January 25, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>A 40-year-old Chicago man, who works as a motivational speaker for the anti-violence group We Stop the Killings, is scheduled to appear in court Feb. 8 after he was charged with hitting a woman in his car, police said.</p>
<p>Warren Jackson was charged with a misdemeanor count of domestic battery, said the Cook County State&rsquo;s Attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Tinley Park Police were called to the Burlington Coat Factory at about 8:23 p.m. Jan. 21 after another shopper reported walking out of the store and seeing a man hitting a woman inside a car parked in the fire lane in front of the store, according to a police report.</p>
<p>The shopper reported seeing the man remove a toddler from the car and put him back in the front passenger seat of the vehicle before turning around from the driver&rsquo;s seat and punching a woman in the back seat, police said. The shopper told police she ran inside to call for help and when she exited again the car had relocated to a different part of the parking lot where the man continued to attack the woman, police said.</p>
<p>Oak Forest Police stopped Jackson&rsquo;s car and arrested him at 8:44 p.m. near the intersection of 159th Street and Laramie Avenue, a few miles east of the store, police said.</p>
<p>The child was sitting in the front seat of the car without a child&rsquo;s safety seat, and the woman was in the back seat of the car with cuts on her face, police said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The woman told police she met Jackson at the store where they planned to buy a coat for the toddler and then they began to argue. A store employee told police she saw the two arguing on a store surveillance camera.</p>
<p>After the alleged attack in the car, the woman said Jackson apologized and said he would return her to the parking lot to pick up her own vehicle after he switched cars because police would be looking for his Mercedes after the incident, police said.</p>

		<p>Blacks sure do seem to like the Burlington Coat Factory for some reason, don&rsquo;t they.<br>
They also seem to like parking in fire zones and handicapped spaces right in front of a store (usually with the engine left running and rap music playing as loud as the dial will allow).  They also seem to like beating on their women.   And they are always sorry afterward, aren&rsquo;t they?  &#8220;Oh baby, I&rsquo;m SO sorry, but ya&rsquo;ll MADE me do it.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Only a white woman could be foolish enough to go to the home of a man with sly-eyes like that, after he beat her (and she said or did nothing) in full view of a public sidewalk and a major department store.</p>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t a budding serial it still smells of something unexplained.</p>
<p>Get out of the car.  If he won&rsquo;t give you the child back then it&rsquo;s instant 1st degree kidnapping the second he touches the accelerator because, if you&rsquo;re the legal guardian, he -cannot- be &#8216;not intending to harm&rsquo; a child, even if he is also it&rsquo;s parent.  Thank you, Amber Hagerman.  That&rsquo;s 20 years in most states.</p>
<p>If he won&rsquo;t stop to let you out, you can bang on the windows at every intersection and _whether he lets you go or not_, it&rsquo;s 1st degree kidnapping again because, by holding you in a car that is moving after a stoplight, he is preventing you from safely debusing from that vehicle.  Even if he locks the doors to keep you &#8216;safe&rsquo; in it.</p>
<p>Just having her in his car after physical violence (assault as a vehicle for forcible removal) is good for 2nd degree kidnapping with 1-8 years possible if the prosecutor knows the game and gets a sympathetic judge.</p>
<p>OTOH, if you ride with him to his house &#8216;on a promise of return&rsquo;, it immediately shows a willingness to accompany him which removes all hope of a higher indictment.  It also puts you out of the public view.  Which is one step short of a death wish if he&rsquo;s worried about you talking to the cops because he&rsquo;s got other issues pending, which you don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
<p>7X the violent crime rate.  35,000 rapes a year.  48% of all murders.  WAKE UP!</p>

<p>I went into a Burlington Coat Factory in Merrillville (suburb of Gary) looking for a simple pair of jeans and, aside from all the ghetto-style jeans with fancy stitching, embroidery, studs, leather accents, chains and other metal hardware, etc., was unable to find a decent pair of jeans in the place. Maybe I should have asked one of the several security guards stationed in the store but I doubt it would have done any good. I noticed that the Burlington Coat Factory moved about a mile east since then to a slightly whiter area.</p>

<p>Yeah, whatever happened to that good old Freedom of Information Act that we keep hearing so much about?</p>

		<p>He&rsquo;s savvy enough to try to switch cars to throw the police off his trail. Makes me think he probably already has some criminal history. He&rsquo;s a &#8220;motivational speaker&#8221;, just a wonderful man trying to end violence, or so he would have his contributors think. In reality he&rsquo;s a con artist, milking the violence angle for personal gain. He must cut a pretty sharp figure in his full-length fur coat (noted in original article). Watch out for people like this; they aren&rsquo;t what they seem.</p>

		<p>Notice that the article neglects to mention the relationship between the perp and his victim?  The two just happen to meet at a clothing store, and decide to buy a coat for a toddler.  No mention of whether these two have ever met one another or the toddler before. Obviously they are the parents of the child, and are no longer together - so why not just say so?</p>
<p>If you click through to the original article you&rsquo;ll see that some of the best parts were left out here at AR - as when the perp&rsquo;s current girlfriend reports to the police station to retrieve his full-length fur coat(!).  It also mentions that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office has filed a lawsuit against his &#8220;charitable organization&#8221;.  Seems it&rsquo;s a fraud, and - are you sitting down? - the money it collects doesn&rsquo;t actually fund efforts to stop youth violence.  Guess it goes to fund Mercedeses and full-length fur coats&hellip;     </p>

		<p>This episode is reminiscent of the &#8220;Million Mom March&#8221; member, who took a gun and shot the Bantu she thought was responsible for putting her son in a wheelchair. Turns out it was a case of mistaken identity.</p>
