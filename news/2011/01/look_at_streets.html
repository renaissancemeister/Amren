<h1>Look at Streets Named for Martin Luther King Jr. Shows We&rsquo;re Still Far From the Promised Land</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>James Ragland, Dallas Morning News, January 17, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Here &rsquo;tis: What do the hundreds of roads and streets that bear King&rsquo;s name  &mdash;  many of which run through racially segregated and dirt poor neighborhoods  &mdash;  say about racial progress in America?</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Comedian Chris Rock wryly observes in old stage routines that some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in America are those that intersect with roads named after King.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a friend calls you on the telephone and says they&rsquo;re lost on Martin Luther King Boulevard and they want to know what they should do, the best response is &#8216;Run!&rsquo;&#8221; Rock once exhorted.</p>
<p>Rock&rsquo;s stereotypical assessment was enough to spur University of North Texas grad student Eric Katzenberger and his former teacher Nathan Berg, a University of Texas at Dallas associate professor, to dig deeper.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>They started by identifying all the streets that bore King&rsquo;s moniker. They turned up 731, more than four-fifths of them in Southern states. Florida leads the way with 335 MLK neighborhoods; Texas boasts 85, including a Dallas boulevard that was named after King 30 years ago.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that most &#8220;MLK neighborhoods&#8221;  &mdash;  the census block groups through which streets named after King run  &mdash;  are largely African-American.</p>
<p>No surprise there. What&rsquo;s a little surprising  &mdash;  and disturbing  &mdash;  is that residents of MLK neighborhoods tend to have lower average incomes than residents &#8220;in other block groups with the same percentage of African-American residents,&#8221; the researchers found.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The researchers don&rsquo;t know why the MLK neighborhoods tend to be poorer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly don&rsquo;t claim that the street name is causing the income gap,&#8221; said Berg.</p>
<p>The reality is that many of the MLK streets are on what we euphemistically call the wrong side of the tracks.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could say that,&#8221; Berg said, before pointing out that hundreds of MLK streets also exist in predominantly white neighborhoods. And 20 to 30 of the streets are in affluent, exclusively white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Even in Dallas, Berg said, &#8220;the ethnic diversity [of MLK Jr. Boulevard neighborhoods] may surprise some people who don&rsquo;t go down there that much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, another troubling stat is that &#8220;the women-to-men ratio is unbalanced&#8221; in MLK neighborhoods, with 14 percent consisting of single moms with kids. That&rsquo;s twice the national average.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8220;The average MLK street is economically isolated and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. racially isolated,&#8221; Berg said. &#8220;But there is far more heterogeneity along MLK streets than popular conception suggests.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Michael King (aka) M.L. King was a showman and a hustler.<br>
If you were to ask 100 blacks what were Kings achievements 99 or the 100 would have no idea.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t laugh just at them I have no idea either.</p>
<p>It was documented that he had an unusual interest in off beat sex and that his life was far from pristine. </p>
<p>There have been various reports of his sexual escapades before he was MURDERED but then again when it comes to blacks if you were to get into some pretty deep research of their accomplishments what you found would not fill a small fishbowl&gt;</p>

		<p>Actually, when counties and municipalities name a thoroughfare or facility after Martin Luther King, they unknowingly are doing whites a major service.  These designations are invaluable in indicating high-crime areas.  Any white person with sense knows to stay out of these areas.  Even the black stand-up comic/actor Chris Rock has a funny routine about this. </p>

		<p>Along with MLK Boulevard, you need to add any MLK middle or high school.<br>
Berg and Katzenberger should do a follow up study that compares schools with MLK in their title since these are almost always ghetto schools.</p>
<p>Recently at MLK Middle School in San Francisco some of the students mistook a cube of rat poison hidden on top of a filing cabinet for candy. The little geniuses were rushed to the hospital and survived. These kids were between 10-12 years old and they did not know better than to ingest a strange blue substance before knowing what it is!</p>

		<p>I recall a conversation with a friend when I lived in St. louis in 1978 and I said I had been on MLK Blvd. that day. He abruptly said &#8220;it&rsquo;s Easton Avenue!&#8221; It will always be Easton Avenue. I don&rsquo;t know who &#8220;Easton&#8221; was but I&rsquo;m sure he was someone that the locals were very fond of! As far as I know, my friend is dead and the &#8220;locals&#8221; only know MLK! What&rsquo;s in a name? Well, in this case, trash, crime, poverty, etc.! I understand that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to venture in that part of the city.<br>
I now live in Atlanta and it&rsquo;s the same here - you don&rsquo;t go to any street with the name MLK - unless you&rsquo;re really brave and you want some good fried fish!</p>

		<p>Its only going to get worse. Obama wasnt the end of<br>
racial awareness, but the intensifying of it. After all<br>
you cannot have the President wage non stop war against<br>
the productive class of his own country for 4 years and<br>
not have a little bit of an awakening as to what<br>
black culture and ideology really means.</p>

		<p>I think that a street name may subconsciously (or consciously) affect who gravitates to the neighborhood.  The name of King will resonate with the lowest classes of blacks, those who are most likely to harbor grievances against successful people.  It would certainly repel whites who harbor traditional American values.  I don&rsquo;t want to write that name as my return address, no matter how nice or white the street is.  The name is telling whites to stay away.</p>

<p>Wow! And I also heard that water is wet!</p>
<p>Do you suppose that &#8220;MLK neighborhoods&#8221; could be predominately poor because they&rsquo;re predominately black? And do you suppose that they have more than their share of unwed mothers because the black community has more than its share of unwed mothers?</p>
<p>How many millions of dollars in government grants did these &#8220;researchers&#8221; get?</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t know why these boulevards (notice how they try to name these street with the grandiose title of boulevards) are poor? The answer is obvious. These boulevards are in neighborhoods dominated and controlled by blacks. These are the neighborhoods are what blacks make them.</p>
<p>I believe there&rsquo;s a real effort to make MKL the number one named street in the US. I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re going to bypass Mail, Elm, Oak, etc. but I believe they&rsquo;re trying.</p>

		<p>Renaming a street costs money.  In general, the businesses on the street strongly lobby against the renaming because they have to change all their databases.</p>
<p>Hence, politicians choose some poor street with no businesses on it to rename after MLK. </p>

		<p>What is the promised land supposed to look like? </p>
<p>When our law-makers decided to force White Americans to assimilate Blacks into our social and political life as our equal did anybody actually look into the future and believe that a few decades of forced integration would turn blacks into White people with dark skin?</p>
<p>We will see progress in racial relations in America when our rulers face the hard truth about Blacks and quit trying to elevate them to positions that their low cognitive abilities would prevent them from reaching in a merit based nation.</p>
<p>Some Blacks are far more intelligent than others. If we can identify those Blacks at an early age and get them into a hormone  treatment regimen to help them control their impulsive behavior, I have no doubt that a small segment of that group will rise to the positions that unqualified Blacks now reach due to mandates from the EEOC.</p>
<p>When you put the promised land on the top rung of the ladder, few Blacks will get there no matter how much the people who run Hollywood and Washington, D.C. think they deserve to be there.  </p>

<p>That&rsquo;s WAY too many streets named after MLK. How about changing some of them to &#8220;Stanley Levinson Blvd&#8221; or &#8220;Stanley Levinson Ave&#8221;? You know, just to mix it up a little. Variety is the spice of life, and all that. </p>

		<p>In my old hometown of Arcadia Florida the blacks started threatening lawsuits and making noise that the city had to rename a street after that fool. The City gave in but split the road into 2 different names. a 3/4 mile section became MLK Blvd. and when the street left the black section it kept its old name and continued for about 2 miles more. The blacks were mad as hell but had to settle for what we would give them. <br>
Sad to say that since that time the destructive integration policies of the state forced on just about every small town in Florida have left Arcadia not much more that a slum.</p>

		<p>I was driving in DC one night and ended up on MLK St. Needless to say I was worried. When I found myself at the corner of MLK and Malcolm X Ave however I really knew it was time to get out of there. Luckily I soon found my way and was relieved to cross the bridge over the Potomac to the safety of Jefferson Davis Highway. </p>
<p>By the way, in case you&rsquo;re wondering what business could ever possibly survive at the intersection of MLK and Malcolm X Ave. Take a look for yourself: https://goo.gl/hc5sq. </p>

		<p>The same think can be said for the Jessie Jackson Townhouses in Greenville SC. They were a city owned slum till they were torn down. Once we start naming streets after Pres Obama, my guess is, they will attract the same kind of people that MLK streets attract. I wonder if research would show that streets named for other well known Blacks would have the same effect on residents? </p>

		<p>What is the interest of Messrs. Berg and Katzenberger in this matter?  They don&rsquo;t sound like the kind of people who would be found living on MLK Blvd.  So why are they so concerned that people there tend to have lower incomes than others?   Are they suggesting that we should take immediate steps to equalize all incomes? Would they exempt their own incomes from that?</p>

		<p>The reason MLK black neiborhoods are poorer than other black neighborhoods: Selection bias.</p>
<p>The streets were re-named as a form of &#8220;steam control&#8221; in what were already the poorest (for whatever reason) neighborhoods.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If you were to ask 100 blacks what were Kings achievements 99 or the 100 would have no idea&#8221;.</p>
<p>When I was in college the university newspaper had this segment called something like &#8216;ask the people&rsquo;. Inside would be photos of 5 or 6 students lined up and beneath their photo would be a quote of what they had to say on a subject. The photographer the paper sent out to do these stories observed that black students really had a sophisticated understanding of racial issues. I think that&rsquo;s true of blacks in general. A typical black teenager knows as much about racial issues as does an AmRen supporter. This could be because AmRen takes up about an hour of our day at most while for black kids talking about or thinking about racial issues is out in the open and a part their life.</p>
<p>African Americans may only be half-informed about racial issues, and might benefit from more schooling, and even benefit from reading AmRen, but what they do &#8216;know&rsquo; about race is quite substantial. A typical black person is more racist than the most extremist AmRen supporter.  </p>

		<p>As far as I know, WV has no MLK streets.  In the lttle city of Huntington, there&rsquo;s a street that was renamed for a black basketball player and redubbed a boulevard (see Sbuffalonative #12&rsquo;s comment).  It&rsquo;s the main thoroughfare in the old ghetto area, which is now racially mixed.  (Huntington is only about 3% black).  Even the capital, Charleston, has only an MLK community center.  <br>
I&rsquo;m sure the reason for so many MLK streets is agitation by black communities.  And what did cities care about the names of places in the ghettos?  They probably would have named them Shaka Zulu Superhighway if that&rsquo;s what the agitators wanted!  <br>
In all articles like this one, the authors always feel compelled to declare puzzlement over the sorry state of anything that&rsquo;s majority black.  It&rsquo;s obvious to all Americans that every municipal feature named for a black is a place to be avoided if feasible.   </p>

		<p>It must be genuinely demoralizing for black kids to sit in an MLK school down the skreet from MLK boulevard where they dodge bullets, crack dealers and whores.  Imagine having your teachers tell you about all the wondrous things MLK accomplished for you against that kind of backdrop.  <br>
 <br>
The only parallel I can draw would be how depressing it must have been for scratch farmers in the dark ages to work in the shadow of crumbling Roman aqueducts. Knowing how great a prior time was and that your present would never be so grand.<br>
 <br>
The only thing that keeps the cycle going for blacks is the continuing need to capitalize on the dark side of the nation&rsquo;s past.  Which they do every time the spotlight is turned their way.  With every February we all get treated to the usual scenes and figures while we are reminded of how little progress blacks have made since MLK&rsquo;s time.  <br>
 <br>
And that all of that lack of progress is the fault of whites.  Imagine being a black kid in an MLK school hearing that and looking at the world around you?  What an amazing breeding ground for problems that never end.  <br>

		<p>What annoys me is that the streets re-named MLK Blvd. often are, or were, streets that were named after people who really and truly were a part of the history of the city or region. That re-naming erases white history, and is an insult to the creation and creators of the city in question.  Do I need to point out that the person was often white, and that the city may have been built by whites, pursuing European/white ideals? It is just one more way for blacks to erase whites from history. </p>

<p>And It&rsquo;s not only in the USA.  MLK is everywhere! Even in Annemasse, a French suburb of Geneva Switzerland, there is a Martin Luther King Community Centre!  (And a large black population too.)</p>
<p>Some of it is doubtless due to &#8220;agitation by black communities&#8221;, as you say.  But it is also due to the wishes of groveling white authorities to PANDER TO blacks. As well as to honor a communist hero.</p>
<p>MLK is a Marxist hero  everywhere, although in America the Marxist part is played down. He isn&rsquo;t just an American figure.  Like Nelson Mandela, for instance, he is an international communist hero, a champion of the blacks and the &#8220;downtrodden&#8221; everywhere. <br>

		<p>Why do these streets carry the full name MLK? All others carry just the last name, as in Washington blvd., Lincoln ave., etc. Is there some implicit message there? I&rsquo;m surprised they don&rsquo;t include the usual honorific Dr. on these street signs just to press the point further. </p>

		<p>Martin Luther King Jr. is a typical myth or legand. If he had managed to live to a rip old age he would have been just another radical but he got lucky and was shot. Getting shot is not quite as good as getting hanged or nailed to a cross but it will do in a pinch if you are looking to create a martyr. </p>
<p>The good thing about creating a myth, legand or martyr is the martyr image and the real person often bear very little resemblance. </p>
<p>Blacks didn&rsquo;t have a hero so the media created one for them. In a few years the church may turn him into a Saint. </p>

You&rsquo;re right about that!  He  was indeed  lucky. Now, he&rsquo;s a saint way up there on his holy altar where he cannot be criticized. If he had lived, eventually all the scandals and sleazyness would have come out, and then what would he have done?  He would have been just another disgraced black preacher.   Nothing unusual there.</p>

They think long names make them sound important. The longer the name, the more important they are.</p>
<p>Blacks place a tremendous emphasis on importance, on being respected. That&rsquo;s why pushers and pimps ride around in flashy cadillacs, diamonds on every finger.  And minor things that would be silly details to whites are important to them. </p>
<p>I remember reading about a woman in Georgia, during the &#8220;civil rights&#8221; era, who made an fuss about how her utility bill was addressed. She refused to pay her bill because it was not addressed to her as  &#8220;Mrs.&#8221; So-and-so. These bills are sent out by computers!  Whites would never even notice such a minor detail, much less make a fuss over it.  If it says &#8220;Evelyn Green&#8221;, they don&rsquo;t take offense. But blacks are super touchy. They think everyone is &#8220;dissin&#8221; them.  Like  Aretha sings, they demand Respect!</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, over here in Wayne County, Ohio, they renamed part of U.S. 30 the MLK Freeway or something like that.</p>
<p>I might add that U.S. 30 has been known as the Lincoln Highway.</p>

		<p>One of the most irritating things to me is the whole bloomin month of February has been designated &#8216;Black History Month.&rsquo; In and of itself it is infuriating enough. But around Atlanta it isn&rsquo;t enough: the local television stations start literally the 15th of January and go to the middle of March with 30 second tidbits throughout the day with &#8220;This has been a Black History Moment.&#8221; They have extended it one full month with two weeks on either end. It&rsquo;s absolutely infuriating.</p>

<p>Give it some time.  He&rsquo;s of no use to the Dems now, just another old dead worthless white male.  The NAACP will drag out his K past and the vilification of Byrd will begin.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when his name will start coming down, everywhere and all at once, replaced with MLK or Malcolm X or Rosa Parks, etc.  It&rsquo;s inevitable.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t feel alone, Illinois gets it here as well. The recent Oprah episode infuriated me more than anything on that day&hellip;I mean seriously, do we REALLY need to be replayed a past episode where whites and blacks watch while the OJ verdict is given, and also I couldn&rsquo;t help how edited that segment looked as a replay. <br>
Whites showed frustration and fought back some of the &#8220;other half&#8221; audiences comments&hellip;with one unforgettable black comment was made &#8220;On this day, justice was served&#8221;&hellip;can&rsquo;t you make up another obvious comment than that? And I wish I can tell that person that justice was not served, cause OJ held up some people in a robbery, so she was wrong nearly 15 years ago!</p>
<p>Oh, and I have witnessed a Malcolm X Ln. in my state, two martin luther king (Again i&rsquo;m not capitalising the words in his name) along with a booker T. Washington building which has a fair share of spray paint vandalism&hellip;great impression for these so called &#8220;Great men of our era&#8221;&hellip;</p>
