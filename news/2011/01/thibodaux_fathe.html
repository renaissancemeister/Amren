<h1>Thibodaux Father of 23 Upset by Facebook Post </h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>John DeSantis, WWL-TV (New Orleans), January 23, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Larry Luther didn&rsquo;t see the Facebook post by a Terrebonne Parish child-support hearing officer about a barroom bouncer appearing before him who has 23 children and &#8220;too much time on his hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>But people who read a Courier and Daily Comet story containing questions about the posting&rsquo;s propriety had little trouble determining who the posting was about and called Luther to tell him.</p>
<p>Now the 41-year-old grandfather says he is preparing to file a Louisiana Judiciary Commission complaint against the hearing officer, William Dunckelman.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Dunckelman has de-activated the Facebook page that includes the post, which never mentioned Luther by name but which judicial-ethics experts say likely crossed acceptable lines of conduct such judges are obligated by law to uphold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just had a fellow leave child support court. He works as a bouncer and has twenty-three (23) children!,&#8221; the post reads. &#8220;Of course he gets paid cash and thus pays no (0) taxes. I think he needs another job as he has way too much time on his hands! What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>What Luther thinks is that the post has negative and unfair implications. His two youngest children are 3 years old. There are three 14-year-olds and the rest are in their upper teens and in their 20s. He fathered his oldest child when he himself was 17.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with the number of children I have, I am a very supportive father,&#8221; Luther said Friday after calling to tell his side of the story. &#8220;Sometimes I have no rest tending to those kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s Jan. 6 appearance before Dunckelman was in regard to only one of his children. The court got involved after the 3-year-old&rsquo;s mother, 23-year-old Courtney Danielle Lewis, was arrested in January 2010 on a charge of second- degree cruelty to a juvenile. Authorities alleged she threw the boy against a couch, which resulted in a fractured leg.</p>
<p>DAY IN COURT</p>
<p>Luther was not involved in the incident. Because the boy was placed in state custody, the state filed against Luther for child support, resulting in his appearance before Dunckelman.</p>
<p>Luther said his day in court  &mdash;  even without the Facebook posting  &mdash;  was problematic. Dunckelman pronounced in open court that he thought Luther had too much spare time during the day, then ordered child-support payments of $299.25 per month, as well as what the court said were arrears of $52.50.</p>
<p>The dollar amount ordered is not Luther&rsquo;s primary concern. Rather, he said, it is Dunckelman&rsquo;s recommendation, written on the support order, that he has trouble with. He also resents that Dunckelman handed him job applications for the Wendy&rsquo;s and Subway restaurant chains, which he maintains he does not need.</p>
<p>Dunckelman&rsquo;s recommendation was that Luther perform a job search 10 times per week and that four of the jobs for which he applied be at fast-food restaurants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a grown man and, I am very supportive,&#8221; Luther said. &#8220;I am not poor and I do make it. I don&rsquo;t need him to tell me I need to get a fast-food job as long as my obligations are met.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>ENFORCING THE RULES</p>
<p>Fathers whose incomes can&rsquo;t be verified by the court pose problems, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My job is to make sure individuals pay their child support,&#8221; Dunckelman said. &#8220;The majority comes out of the income-assignment order which ensures that payments are taken out before any other wages are paid. We insist that the father find gainful employment. The state mandates that I order them to produce hospitalization insurance on their children. They cannot get insurance unless they have gainful employment through an employer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Handing out job applications, Dunckelman said, is part of ensuring that dads who need work get help finding it.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>&#8216;HIS BLESSINGS&rsquo;</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s position, that he is an involved and dedicated father to his 23 children and should thus not be characterized as a deadbeat dad, is shared by mothers of his children who were interviewed this week.</p>
<p>Rasheedra Mahoney, 32, is mother to three of Luther&rsquo;s children  &mdash;  Quarneisha, 14, Ty&rsquo;quial, 10, and Larryel Mahoney, 9.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a lot of kids, but he also that is how he gets his blessings. Every dollar he gets through his hands goes to his kids. I have never seen one of them neglected,&#8221; the Houma nursing assistant said. {snip}</p>

		<p><i>&ldquo;Even with the number of children I have, I am a very supportive father,&rdquo; Luther said Friday after calling to tell his side of the story.</i></p>
<p>And just how do you support 23 children by who knows how many women through under the table jobs?</p>
<p>The original article doesn&rsquo;t say how many different women he has those 23 children, but I did find this part that AR snipped:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;I have told my sons at 17 and 18 to strap up, use condoms,&rdquo; Luther said. &ldquo;Times are harder now than when I was coming up. A child can be a setback if you are not prepared.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Seems from that bunch that the condom talk should come way before 17.  That said, something has been grinding at me for awhile, and that&rsquo;s this issue about free condom distribution, mainly to blacks and Hispanics.  I think the best argument against it isn&rsquo;t religious or moral, but ethical and secular:  Why should consequence-free sex be free of charge to the end user?  Why should I have to buy my own condoms yet pay for other people&rsquo;s condoms through taxes?</p>

<p>Dad of 23 gets prison for non-support<br/>
Howard Veal has kids with 14 women<br/>
24 Sep 2010, <br/>
Associated Press<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/38n9l2v</p>
<p>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - A western Michigan man accused of fathering 23 children with 14 women and has been sent to prison for at least two years for failing to pay tens of thousands of dollars in child support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animals procreate. Human beings are supposed to nurture their children,&#8221; Kent County Circuit Judge Dennis Leiber said Thursday.<br/>
Howard Veal, 44, of Muskegon owes more than $533,000 in child support&hellip;&#8221;</p>
<p>* * *<br/>
&#8220;I was paying money from my unemployment,&#8221; Veal told the judge. &#8220;I never chose not to pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leiber said he was &#8220;stunned and amazed&#8221; by Veal&rsquo;s actions.<br/>
&#8220;You&rsquo;re an insult to every responsible father who sacrifices to provide for their children,&#8221; he said.<br/>

<p>Hmm, I don&rsquo;t know which judicial-ethics &#8220;experts&#8221; are all unanimous about a Facebook posting that doesn&rsquo;t even mention the name of the person in question, but I do notice that this article spends an awful lot of time defending Luther and very little defending the hearing officer. Which once again raises questions about the ethics of an MSM writer for writing yet another obviously slanted article that calls another citizen&rsquo;s freedom of speech rights into question. </p>

		<p>CAVALCADE of BABYNAMES!</p>
<p>Quarneisha, Rasheedra, Larryel,***Ty&rsquo;quial***&hellip; Why exhaust yourself trying to invent the perfect babyname, when between Mr. Luther&rsquo;s 23 children and his Babymamas, there are are surely more than enough stellar choices for any large family group. In fact, some of these would be great names for Pharmaceuticals, too!</p>
<p>Just the name &#8216;Larryel&rsquo; would be good for a baby girl (the feminine form of &#8216;Larry&rsquo;, a baby boy (the &#8216;el&rsquo; on the end makes it Spanish), a medication for the Larynx, or a small extended-cab Pickup Truck.</p>
<p>But I suspect the distinction Mr. Luther has failed to grasp is that Terrebonne Parish is less interested in fathers who are &#8216;supportive&rsquo; of their children, than it is of fathers who support their children</p>
<p>Among my old school chums are some very rich Catholics from Thibodeaux, whose families are large.  But even their parents called it quits after baby number six or eight.  Even mansion-dwelling owners of oil wells and Sugarcane fields can afford no more than that.  So, I have to wonder just how much cash money a Thibodeaux bouncer makes&hellip;and what the IRS has to say about all this.</p>

		<p>The whole lot of them look so healthy.  They&rsquo;ll all make fine additions to the American workforce.  So how did they all get to be so healthy and even hefty in a few cases, when Dad wasn&rsquo;t paying any support?  They must have been raised by some VERY resourceful mothers who have an amazing entrepreneurial quality.  After all, it&rsquo;s difficult in America to be a single black mother!<br/>

		<p>From Post # 4: &#8220;blacks  &mdash;  they&rsquo;re vastly better than white people at getting their genes into the pool.&#8221;</p>
<p>In evolutionary terms, African-Americans are 10 x more fit than European-Americans.  Not only do they have more kids, but their generation time is ~20 yrs, vs, ~ 30 yrs for Whites.  Thus, in 60 years they&rsquo;ve had 3 generations vs. only 2 generations for Whites.  Do the  math; blacks or Hispanics will totally overwhelm Whites.  The future belongs to whoever breeds fastest and breeds the most.</p>
<p>But wait, it gets worse:  Whites are taxed to raise Black kids, leaving White families with little time or money to have their own children.  Whites have to work more hours, because the government is taking so much of their income.  With less time and money, whites have less children   &mdash;   How can you have more children when both parents are already working full time, and can just barely scrape by as it is? </p>
<p>Blacks reproduce way faster, and that is made possible by transferring money from Whites to Blacks, causing Whites to have less children.  </p>
<p>It is really a form of parasitism.  It is social and economic slavery   &mdash;   Whites work hard so that Blacks can breed and not work.  <br/>

		<p>I really hate to do this because having 23 kids is just wrong.  </p>
<p>Especially if you know you don&rsquo;t have the best &#8216;street&rsquo; background to contribute to theirs or societies future by fathering them.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>If this judge or &#8216;hearing officer&rsquo; Dunckelman has fellow court officers who know about his FB Page and they read of his bias in it towards this man, (described as black or not, named or not), it could theoretically bias -them- in their treatments of Luther.</p>
<p>Luther is trying to assume custody of a 3-year old and has the means (rentals, car restoration and a 1,300/mo bouncer income) to do so.  While this may or may not make it possible for the State to assess fees against him to ensure the kid&rsquo;s medical coverage, the fact is that -as long as he does his part- to ensure the correct welfare of his own (and there are, apparently, no other outstandings against him), it is not the business of a sitting judge to air his laundry, publically, on the internet.</p>
<p>Certainly &#8216;asking others what they think about this&rsquo; (wrt: too much time on his hands comment) suggests that, as a judge, Dunckelman is _looking for_ bias, to support his own.</p>
<p>Which is the act of a vote-seeking politician, not a judiciate.</p>
<p>From what I read, Dunckelman has had a good career and done some good things.  I certainly hope he was well paid.  Yet it sounds to me, from his &#8216;thankless position&rsquo; comment, like it&rsquo;s time to retire and get away from the bitterness of dealing with these kinds of people.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly like blacks.  I don&rsquo;t like anyone having this many kids so that we can support them through their mother&rsquo;s welfare.</p>
<p>Specifically, I look at 23 kids and I realize that&rsquo;s the equivalent of 13 white couples (@1.82 TFR) being overrun in the lemming race to the bottom of the LCD scale on the genetic survival of our nation and legacy inheritance of this country.</p>
<p>But this was not the way to point out that inequity by a man in Dunckelman&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>And we should remember that lesson, when it comes time to deal with our own social miscreants.</p>

		<p>Thank you, Michael C. Scott, for kindly overlooking all my typos.</p>
<p>And I agree that &#8220;Ty&rsquo;quial&#8221; would be a brilliant name for a medication purporting to relieve Restless Leg Syndrome. Considering that simply reading the name, for many of us, is enough to summon the sensation of a nervous twitch, &#8220;Ty&rsquo;quial&#8221; would be a rare marketing gem.  The name would exacerbate the very condition the drug was purported to relieve.  That, I believe, is known as &#8216;Stimulating Demand&rsquo;.</p>

		<p>20:  Maybe, but you&rsquo;re assuming that the beneficiaries of free condom distribution programs necessarily use them.  From all I have come to hear and understand, they don&rsquo;t.  What we attain too cheaply we esteem too lightly.  If you don&rsquo;t have $6.50 (or so) for a box of condoms, then you&rsquo;re really too stupid to understand the perhaps longer term consequences of your actions.  Then again, there I go again, being all arrogant.</p>

		<p>I know this guy, and he totally lied to the press. He has several kids between the ages of three and 14(not mostly teens as he suggests) and pays absolutely NO child support (at least that&rsquo;s what some of his babies&rsquo; mommas have said).  And if you ask him, he&rsquo;s not even able to remember the names of all of his kids or their mommas. He needs to take his own advise, &#8220;strap up and use a condom&#8221;!!!</p>
