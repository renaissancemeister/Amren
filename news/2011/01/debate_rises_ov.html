			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Diane Macedo, FoxNews, January 11, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lyglenson Lemorin, who was acquitted in an alleged terror plot against Chicago Sears Tower but is still considered by U.S. officials to be a terrorist sympathizer and threat to national security, is among those Haitian nationals set to be deported, the Miami Herald reported.</p>
<p>Human rights groups are protesting moves by Immigrations Customs Enforcement to deport some 350 Haitians with criminal records in January, as the temporary protected status for earthquake victims comes to a close.</p>
<p>The groups say that sending the criminals back to the cholera infested country is a death sentence.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But supporters of the deportations say the groups are exaggerating the conditions that await these deported criminals  &mdash;  which include murderers, kidnappers, and other violent criminals  &mdash;  and that keeping them in the U.S. puts Americans&rsquo; safety at risk.</p>
<p>The U.S. halted deportations to Haiti after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake. A year later, Immigrations Customs Enforcement says either it must send Haitian criminals that have served their time back to Haiti or release them into the American public.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Given the options, the agency says in mid January it will start deporting Haitians convicted of violent crimes who have completed their sentences.</p>
<p>&#8220;ICE expects to remove approximately 700 criminal aliens from Haiti in 2011,&#8221; an ICE official told FoxNews.com.</p>
<p>{snip}<br>

<p>Speaking for myself, my friends and my family, we don&rsquo;t care what they do really.  We are perfectly capable of defending ourselves.</p>
<p>If they are let loose they&rsquo;ll stick around the urban areas, someplace we rarely go anyway.  Let the liberals get the full effect of what they caused to happen.<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s a measure of how deranged society has become that it&rsquo;s deeply surpring&hellip; shocking even&hellip; that a government agency, in this case Immigrations Customs Enforcement, is actually siding with Americans against foreigners in a matter of immigration. </p>
<p>Without reading the article you&rsquo;d just assume ICE was planning to release these Haitians into the US, bend over backwards to ensure that they get on benefits and into subsidised housing, and lobby passionately against any American who dared object.</p>
<p>Hooray for ICE in this case, even though they&rsquo;ll probably end up being forced to release these guys.</p>

		<p>Only an imbecile or a bureaucrat would suggest turning foreign criminals loose in this country.</p>
<p>Maybe they should be put on a leaky boat for the return ride in the hopes that it doesn&rsquo;t make it.</p>

		<p>Finally someone made a good decision!  Deport all those who broke the law!  I guess that includes about 20 million &#8216;undocumenteds.&rsquo;</p>

		<p>Let me get this straight: those Haitians already living in Haiti should remain there, but convicted criminals should not be sent back there?  Or are these &#8220;human rights groups&#8221; arguing that the entire population of Haiti should be brought here?</p>
<p>And if going to Haiti is a &#8220;death sentence&#8221; because of cholera, does that not mean that the entire population of Haiti will be expected to die off?</p>
<p>Only liberals could come up with arguments so idiotic.</p>

		<p>Why don&rsquo;t we send ALL of our criminals to Haiti? That worked out great for Castro when he emptied out his jails and mental hospitals during the Mariel boatlift. If we double up on the bribes to what passes for government officials in Haiti and kick in some extra gruel for the teaming masses of wretched refuse, then we should be able to pull it off.</p>

		<p>We need to be looking out for our own people first. What happens to Haitian criminals once they go back to Haiti is no concern of ours.</p>

		<p>This is exactly what they are doing in South Africa with all the illegal Zimbabweans, since a lot of the crime is due to a third force. Sending them back to their country of birth!</p>
<p>It is a good thing because then they can go back to their country and tell everyone back home how good they had it in their host country and effect change in their own.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The groups say that sending the criminals back to the cholera infested country is a death sentence.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve replied, &#8220;and that is my problem, because why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Human rights Activist?</p>
<p>Oh the rhetoric gets so old.</p>
<p>The problem is that they keep coming back because lets face it Haiti isn&rsquo;t exactly &#8220;Disney Land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altruism is really becoming old on the scene of the left. </p>
<p>Maybe those &#8220;Human Rights Activist&#8221; should just make permanent base camp in Haiti and help them there.</p>

		<p>I suppose I missed something.  Haitian criminals have completed their sentences; why would there even be a question about sending them back? If they liked it here, they should have at least tried to become a (relatively) productive, albeit illegal, member of society; failing that, they could have avoided the commission of crimes and stayed off the radar.</p>
