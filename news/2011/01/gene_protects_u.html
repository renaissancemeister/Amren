			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Maggie Fox, Reuters, January 27, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Some black Americans have a gene that protects them from heart disease, researchers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>About a quarter of African-Americans carry the protective gene, and if they are lucky enough to have two copies, one from each parent, their risk of heart disease is 10 times lower that of other blacks.</p>
<p>People with just one copy have five times lower the risk of heart attacks, blocked arteries and other symptoms of heart disease, the team reported in the Journal of Human Genetics.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we think we have here is the first confirmed hereditary link to cardiovascular disease among African-Americans and it is a protective one,&#8221; Diane Becker of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said in a statement.</p>
<p>The same gene has been studied in people from Japan, South Korea, Europe and elsewhere but not in black people. In fact, few such genetic studies have been done in blacks at all, the researchers said.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>It is becoming more common to use ethnic origin to define disease risks.</p>
<p>In 2005, Nitromed Inc. got U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market its heart drug BiDil specifically to blacks after it was shown to benefit African-Americans more than whites.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that African-Americans are less likely than whites to be prescribed heart drugs or receive bypass surgery, although blacks have an overall greater risk of heart disease than whites<br>

		<p>Most French people also have genes that protect them from heart disease despite massive amounts of butter, cream, pate (50% fat)fatty pork, beef, duck and other meats. Ever seen charcroute? A big pile of sauerkraut with ham hocks that are about 40 percent solid fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that this was published.  Most of what is published about blacks is that they are poor pitiful weaklings prone to every disease, disfunction and disability and can only be kept alive by loving, caring, self sacrificing Whites.</p>

No, most of what&rsquo;s published about blacks implies that every disease that they&rsquo;re prone to is the result, directly or indirectly, of slavery or white &#8220;racism&#8221;. I&rsquo;m pretty sure they&rsquo;d blame whites for sickle cell anemia if the genetic mechanism for the disease was not crystal clear.<br>
If anything, the mainstream media claims that in the absence of white oppression, blacks would be a master race.</p>

		<p>Note that the article gets in the jab that blacks are prescribed less heart meds and receive less bypasses.  Of course, readers are to presume that white racism is at fault, when the reason is that blacks seek treatment much less than whites.  </p>

		<p>@#2-I think the &#8220;gene&#8221; that protects the French is their propensity for eating foods that the human organism naturally craves, and is set up to make the most use of, i.e., animal-based fats and protein. Add to that a sensible attitude towards the consumption of alcohol, wine in particular, and you have a solid base for happiness and long life. Contrast their habits with that of their cousins across the Atlantic, with their penchant for overdosing on &#8220;healthy&#8221; and completely artificial vegetable fats and heaping gobs of sugar and bowel irritant grain-based &#8220;food&#8221;, and washing it down with ruined dairy products or more sugar in the form of soft drinks. </p>
<p>And which country has the epidemic heart disease rates?   The one in which the entire cholesterol scare campaign still rampages, with a huge profit margin for the medical establishment and the drug manufacturers. </p>
<p>  This article comes off as a typical unscientific puff piece. There&rsquo;s a lot of grade school-style between-the-words implication that blacks are once again being given the short shrift thanks to (ahem) racism. Maybe the &#8220;protective&#8221; gene causes some black folks to recoil in horror at the sight of the Golden Arches? </p>

		<p>Look at this scientific study.<br>
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7118/full/nature05329.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7118/full/nature05329.html</a><br>
Look at the huge number of scientists and institutions that took part in this scientific study.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from the study above:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have constructed a first-generation CNV map of the human genome through the study of 270 individuals from FOUR POPULATIONS with ANCESTRY in EUROPE, AFRICA and ASIA (the HAPMAP collection). DNA from these individuals was screened for CNV using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays, and clone-based comparative genomic hybridization. A total of 1,447 copy number VARIABLE REGIONS (CNVRs), which can encompass overlapping or adjacent gains or losses, covering 360 megabases (12% OF THE GENOME) were identified in these populations.&#8221;<br>
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>The study indicates that a 12% Copy number variation exists between the races.</p>
<p>Like I said before, MODERN GENETICS have proved that we are all very much less alike than the Human genome project initially thought back in the year 2001. The HGP never even looked at COPY NUMBER VARIATIONS (CNV) because back then it did not even know that CNV&rsquo;s existed.</p>
<p>Here is an easy example.</p>
<p>If one man has a banana and another man has 10 bananas, then the HGP claimed that the bananas between them were 99.9% identical. This was the logic of the human genome project, when it concluded that all humans are 99.9% identical.</p>
<p>BUT one man has more bananas than the other.<br>
This is a single &#8220;Copy number variation.&#8221; CNV<br>
As you can see CNV differences are very important.</p>
<p>Now modern science tells us that 12% CNV exists between the races.</p>
<p>Here it is presented in graphical form.<br>
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7118/fig_tab/nature05329_F7.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7118/fig_tab/nature05329_F7.html</a></p>
<p>Then look at this scientific study.<br>
Go to the Hapmap here&hellip;<br>
<a href="http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</a></p>
<p>Then click on the publication entitled:<br>
&#8220;A SECOND GENERATION HUMAN HAPMAP with over 3.1mil SNP&rsquo;s&#8221;<br>
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/abs/nature06258.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7164/abs/nature06258.html</a><br>
Look at the huge number of institutions that took part (72) All the major genetic institutions from all over the world.</p>
<p>AND HERE are their findings:</p>
<p>&#8220;We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25–35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>So we know that<br>
1) CNV differences between the races are 12%<br>
2) SNP differences between the races are 25-35%.</p>
<p>Note that this is a second generation Hapmap study. The first was the HGP.<br>
The human genome project concluded that all humans are 99.9% identical based on SNP analysis.<br>
How they did this considering that they only had the genome of one person is beyond me. This one genomes was also spliced together from multiple donors, so effectively it could not be used for any science apart to say that they had mapped the first human genome.</p>
<p>The second generation study as linked above proved that the real SNP difference is 25-35%. HUGE&hellip;.</p>
<p>If the human genome is likened to a book, then a single SNP difference is a single word spelt wrong and a single CNV is a whole page that is different.</p>
<p>Genetics have proved huge genetic differences between the races.</p>
<p>This is SCIENCE fact.<br>
Don&rsquo;t liberals always claim that we have to celebrate our diversity.<br>

<p>Heart Disease has more to do with stress than anything else. When the black man is stressing about his welfare check, he has greater health problems. When the white man stresses about paying taxes so the black man has an easy life, he has greater health problems also. </p>
