<h1><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/world/asia/03japan.html?_r=1">Japan Keeps a High Wall for Foreign Labor</a></h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>Hiroko Tabuchi, New York Times, January 2, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Despite facing an imminent labor shortage as its population ages, Japan has done little to open itself up to immigration. In fact, as Ms. Fransiska [Maria Fransiska, and Indonesian nurse] and many others have discovered, the government is doing the opposite, actively encouraging both foreign workers and foreign graduates of its universities and professional schools to return home while protecting tiny interest groups  &mdash;  in the case of Ms. Fransiska, a local nursing association afraid that an influx of foreign nurses would lower industry salaries.</p>
<p>In 2009, the number of registered foreigners here fell for the first time since the government started to track annual records almost a half-century ago, shrinking 1.4 percent from a year earlier to 2.19 million people  &mdash;  or just 1.71 percent of Japan&rsquo;s overall population of 127.5 million.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>But instead of accepting young workers, however  &mdash;  and along with them, fresh ideas  &mdash;  Tokyo seems to have resigned itself to a demographic crisis that threatens to stunt the country&rsquo;s economic growth, hamper efforts to deal with its chronic budget deficits and bankrupt its social security system.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re in the medical field, it&rsquo;s obvious that Japan needs workers from overseas to survive. But there&rsquo;s still resistance,&#8221; said Yukiyoshi Shintani, chairman of the Aoikai Group, the medical services company that is sponsoring Ms. Fransiska and three other nurses to work at a hospital outside Tokyo. &#8220;The exam,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is to make sure the foreigners will fail.&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;If you&rsquo;re in the medical field, it&rsquo;s obvious that Japan needs workers from overseas to -survive-&hellip;&#8221;:  This is often said about any and all fields of work, as if the very survival of humankind is dependant upon bringing in foreign workers.  Again though, this is both a half-statement and a lie.  The statement should end with something like: &#8220;&hellip;needs workers from overseas to survive, so that I can maintain my excessively high standard of living even if the rest of you low-lifes end up living in a multicultural hell-on-earth.&#8221; That, is what the proponents of immigration are really saying.  That the Japanese wish to maintain their ethnic homogenity may cause them some short term economic discomfort, but the long term gain is that they will be able to maintain their stable, peaceful, and highly efficient society well into the future.</p>

		<p>What bunk! Like one day someone is going to get off a plane in Japan and find it empty or call and no one&rsquo;s there. Populations grow and shrink. Once the populations falls to a point where people are not concerned with working 20 hour days and begin to enjoy life, it will start to grow again.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The exam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is to make sure the foreigners will fail.&rdquo;  I mentioned this same scenario happening with English teachers in Korea several months ago on Amren and End to Illusion, who is East Asian, tried to deny it.  It happens throughout East Asia regardless of the profession.  East Asians set up situations designed for non-East Asians to fail at then slander them. </p>
<p>Japan has the same population as Russia, the largest in Europe and geographically the largest country on Earth.  However, Russia has a substantial non-white population.  More than 75% of the 2.19 million foreigners in Japan are Chinese or Korean.  They are people that look exactly like them, are genetically very similar to one another and have cultures that shaped Japan.  It&rsquo;s not like the flood of East Asians into white countries or anything white.</p>
<p>The difference between Japan and every white country is white and Middle Eastern businessmen and politicians don&rsquo;t care about the long term future of the countries let alone white people as long as they make a buck today everything is great.  The mindset of white people starting with white businessmen and politicians needs to completely change in order for the downward slide white people are on to reverse.</p>

		<p>And as a result, Japan has one of the most colorful, interesting cultures in the world, a harmonious low-crime society, and a strong national identity. Japan&rsquo;s population will shrink before it begins to grow again. Yes, there will be some pain, but Japan will survive while other countries, overburdened with migrant populations and ethnic divisiveness will die. </p>
<p>What really happened to the Roman Empire? Academic textbooks tell you they got too big and stretched too thin. This may be, but mostly the collapse was due to massive immigration of Germanic tribesman coupled with a low birthrate of Roman-born citizens. </p>

		<p>I think in the long run Japan will do just fine. Population changes follow cycles based on people&rsquo;s life spans. It isn&rsquo;t until people are old that they think back on their choices between having kids and having fun. The 20th century has been tough on the developed world what with the depression, world wars, and then the welfare state and the high standard of living. Having kids always seemed to be a second choice. Soon enough older Japanese will regret not having that extra child. They&rsquo;ll pass this lesson onto the younger generation. </p>
<p>Compare Japan with California which has done nothing to keep out foreigners. California has troubles everywhere. Japan&rsquo;s population problem is easier to fix than the mess in California.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The shrinking population is the biggest problem. The country is fighting for its survival,&rdquo; said Hidenori Sakanaka, director of the Japan Immigration Policy Institute, an independent research organization. &ldquo;Despite everything, America manages to stay vibrant because it attracts people from all over the world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On the other hand, Japan is content to all but shut out people from overseas.&rdquo; </p>

		<p>As we here all know, Japan need only look at EU and America to see where importing cheap labor takes a country. I understand that Japan has a relatively low crime rate for an industrialized country and if they want it to stay that way, they will keep African blacks and muslims (i.e. criminals) out of their country.</p>

<p>How can these people say this with a straight face! This country HAS accepted MILLIONS of &#8220;young workers&#8221; which has stunted our economic growth, is one of the main reasons of our &#8220;chronic budget deficits&#8221; and are quickly bankrupting our social security system. </p>

		<p>Last time I saw anything about economic growth in the media Japan their economy was growingt despite a drop in population. Japan&rsquo;s GDP is said to have grown by 2% in the period July 2009 to June 2010 ascompared to 3.3% in Australia and 3% in the USA which means they experienced a real growth in living standards. - and without the flood of immigrants that Western economies are said to rely on. The truth is that many migrants are &#8216;dead wood&rsquo; and contibute more to social problems than to economic growth - something Westerners are unlikley to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Diversity breeds innovation! You hear this all the time. To me it&rsquo;s simply a mystery why anyone would think that in this golden age of global telecommunications it would be necessary to move people physically in order to move ideas.</p>
<p>Another thing with Japan is that they&rsquo;ve begun to tackle the problem of an aging population through technological innovation, while our solution appears to be bringing in people from poor countries to (hopefully) care for us. Japan is directly contradicting many of the central claims of the multiculturalists. The latter answer simply by burying their heads even deeper into the sand.</p>

		<p> heck I agrre with them wanting to keep and hire only Japanese workers. The problem is they want to keep their own culture and independence. I think this is a good thing and with robotics they will achieve this and as the population decreases they will create more green spaces. Why would they want to continue having their country bursting at the seams?</p>

		<p>The Japanese are a great model for American and European White Nationalists - everything but the low birth rate.</p>
<p>The Japanese post World War II don&rsquo;t make a lot of noise about being racial nationalists and they don&rsquo;t make a lot of noise internationally jumping in to other people&rsquo;s wars, problems - most everyone in the country likes Japan to be Japanese and enough Japanese live abroad to see what things are like in say Brazil or California, New York City, sample some other stuff - then go back to Japan and make sure that no Japanese city has the problems of San Paulo or Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Japanese media is also completely different than the American MSM. </p>
<p>Only one thing I don&rsquo;t understand is the decline of Japan in international sports - the Japanese men&rsquo;s gymanstic team used to be best or 2nd best in the Olympics, not any more.</p>

		<p>Nice to see so many postings in support of cultural and racial preservation.  The Japanese subscribe to the universal truth that racial and cultural similarity is a source of strength and unity.</p>
<p>Only in America could such a perverse and patently absurd nostrum such as &#8220;our strength is in our diversity&#8221; gain currency. Racial, ethnic, and cultural differences are a source of conflict.  Period.</p>
<p>To be sure, such differences give rise to a broader range of dietary and artistic experiences, but these sorts of differences produce little that is vital, lasting, or in any way socially important. </p>
<p>Somehow I believe I could get by without Mexican restaurants or black African influence in our music. I&rsquo;d happily give them up for a dramatically lowered crime and unemployment rate in this country.</p>

		<p>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A LABOR SHORTAGE!</p>
<p>What it really means is that the LABORER gets something of an advantage over the employer, which is a GOOD THING, it encourages GROWTH in the economy because businesses are inclined to invest and develop efficiency rather then simply firing workers and finding people who will work for less!</p>
<p>Naturally the government/big business/nation wreckers don&rsquo;t like &#8220;labor shortage&#8221; because it harms them and their interests!</p>

		<p>Japan&rsquo;s economy is almost as large as our own, even though they have less than a third as many people.  They have so much money, they don&rsquo;t know what to do with it are are blowing it on fancy robots, over-powered bullet trains, and floating airports.  But what Japan has which it can&rsquo;t lose, is its ethnic purity.  Why does this article suggest they should hand away their country to foreigners, simply for economy gain and &#8220;fresh ideas?&#8221;  I commend the Japanese for working so hard to keep what every country from Canada, to Germany, to the Antipodes has given away.</p>

<p>Actually, I think as far as the Japanese are concerned, the Hispanic illegals analogy would hold up rather well as far as they see Chinese immigrants. As they would see Koreans, too. I don&rsquo;t think there exist too many pent up dislikes of other peoples in the world as there does between a lot of Asian countries. And a racial awareness that the homogenous nations of Europe could only dream of.</p>

		<p>A declining population is likely to mean a higher standard of living. We can show the relationship with the following equation:<br>
 <br>
(natural resources x level of technology) / population = standard of living.<br>
 <br>
Another way of looking at it is that fewer people mean fewer consumers and fewer job applicants. By the law of supply and demand this means lower prices and higher wages. <br>
 <br>
The simplest way to understand it is that fewer people means that there is more of everything good to go around.</p>

The longer a racial group has practiced urban civilization, the lower its crime rate is likely to be. Over a period of many generations the criminal justice system of a urban civilization removes those with criminal inclinations from the gene pool.</p>

		<p>John Engelman is right.  Corporations can&rsquo;t build up more profits and drive down labor costs in a nation with a stable or declining population.  However, since it&rsquo;s the New York Times and not the Japanese who are calling for more immigration there&rsquo;s more to it than just corporate profits.  Perhaps it&rsquo;s an attempt to mix up all the world&rsquo;s nations and dilute the native populations as a first step in implementing one world government.  Or maybe the US realizes that because of its burgeoning and rapidly growing minority populations dragging it down that the future players of the world will be homogenous nations in Europe and Asia.  Therefore the only way to compete is to export diversity into these other nations and bring them down to the level of the US.  They can also use overseas US military bases as breeding grounds for black and brown soldiers to hook up with or rape the local women and produce more &#8220;Afro-Germans&#8221; or &#8220;Japinos&#8221; and lower the national IQ.  </p>
