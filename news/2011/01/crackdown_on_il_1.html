<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>The Obama administration plans to intensify a crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants with the establishment of an audit office designed to bolster verification of company hiring records.</p>
<p>In an interview, John Morton, chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, said the Employment Compliance Inspection Center would &#8220;address a need to conduct audits even of the largest employers with a very large number of employees.&#8221; The office would be announced Thursday, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton said that the center would be staffed with specialists who will pore over the I-9 employee files collected from companies targeted for audits.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2010, ICE conducted audits of more than 2,740 companies, nearly twice as many as the previous year. The agency levied a record $7 million in civil fines on businesses that employed illegal workers.</p>
<p>Enforcement activity during the Bush administration focused on high-profile raids in which thousands of illegal immigrants were arrested and placed in deportation proceedings. Relatively few companies and their executives were prosecuted.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Obama administration has made employers the center of its immigration policy with &#8220;silent raids.&#8221; Critics say the policy has penalized small employers while failing to target larger employers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The audits, which have affected garment makers, fruit growers and meat packers, result in the firing of every illegal immigrant on a company&rsquo;s payroll. Companies say this has hurt them, especially as they can&rsquo;t attract American workers even during an economic downturn.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, Gebbers Farm, an agricultural concern in Brewster, Wash., dismissed an estimated 550 workers  &mdash;  about a quarter of the local population  &mdash;  after ICE told the company a number of its employees&rsquo; hiring documents were suspect. {snip}</p>
<p>Tom Roach, an immigration attorney in Pasco, Wash., said a client lost more than half of his workforce last year owing to an audit. &#8220;He had paid every nickel of taxes on them,&#8221; he said. But the employees had presented social-security cards that the landscape company couldn&rsquo;t discern were fake, said Mr. Roach.</p>
<p>Small business owners, in particular, say they don&rsquo;t have the ability to police their workers. They also fear discrimination suits, as some companies have experienced, for demanding additional documents from workers whom they suspect are in the country illegally.</p>

		<p>This is a good start   &mdash;   let&rsquo;s keep the momentum going.  Illegal immigration is a multidimensional problem that requires multidimensional solutions.  Build the fence, hire more immigration inspectors, institute E-verify, deport, end anchor babies and chain migration, and toss greedy businessmen who hire illegals instead of Americans in jail.  </p>

<p>What is really necessary is decades of prison time for anyone who hires mexicans followed up with bans on foreign goods and labor.</p>
<p>Just like every other country besides ours engages in.</p>

		<p>Isn&rsquo;t it interesting that the Feds are only now starting to crack down on the employers of illegal workers. Couldn&rsquo;t be the overturning of the DREAM ACT, could it? Well, it&rsquo;s about time, President Obama! Got a late start, didn&rsquo;t you?<br/>

<p>Gearing up for the 2012 election, I see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure Clinton is advising 0bama on the fine art of &#8216;triangulating&rsquo; which Clinton used after bad losses in midterm elections, going on to win re-election. </p>
<p>0bama will be dragged kicking and screaming to the middle, defy his own party, and seemingly agree with the GOP on key issues.  It worked for Clinton and if 0bama&rsquo;s handlers play their cards right, it will work for their candidate too.</p>
<p>Prediction:  0bama will be re-elected to a second term.  Hope I&rsquo;m wrong but I don&rsquo;t think I am.</p>

		<p>A group as small as five people can wreak havoc on illegal-alien-employing businesses in the local town.</p>
<p>America is RIFE with regulation and legal obstacles.  We all know those fall more heavily on certain people&hellip;use that to our advantage.</p>
<p>Call in health violations.  Call the police often, when you see large groups of mestizo gang-bangers in the mestizo-employing restaurant.  Arrange boycotts and write letters about the boycott (but keep your mouth shut about other stuff).  Start rumors (poor hygiene, health violations, murders, stabbings in the business&rsquo; area or vicinity).  Probably the rumors are true anyway!</p>
<p>Basically, do what the slimey Marxists have been doing for half a century, put a Snickers bar in the pool&hellip;in THEIR pool for a change.</p>

<p>This claim by these companies is nonsense.</p>
<p>Every job has its price, and if with no illegals to do them, these companies can&rsquo;t find anyone to do them at the price illegals were doing them, then guess what? Time to pay more.</p>
<p>And if they can&rsquo;t pay more because their competitors are hiring illegals? Then turn in their competitors. And if after almost every illegal has been run out of the job market, wages are raised and people STILL won&rsquo;t do those jobs, then it might, MIGHT be worth instituting a tightly regulated guest worker program.</p>
<p>The point is, massive immigration of illegal cheap labor might be a solution for the companies mentioned in the article, but it is unacceptable to the citizens of this country. These companies better get with the program.</p>

<p>Great!</p>
<p><i>Companies say this has hurt them, especially as they can&rsquo;t attract American workers even during an economic downturn.</i></p>
<p>So what? What makes these people think every industry is suited to every locale? You don&rsquo;t see people trying to grow oranges and pineapples in Alaska. Why should it be any different for labor? If they can&rsquo;t find any Americans to work for their business then maybe they are in the wrong business. Maybe that&rsquo;s an industry better suited to Mexico? If so then they should build their sweatshop down there instead of coaxing illegals up here.</p>

		<p>If Obama really had any care for the interests of the Blacks of America then he would see that companies shipping in cheap workers, for whom they do not have to pay taxes, insurance or minimum wage, are acting to depress wages for those blacks who do work and to make it harder for unemployed blacks to find work.</p>
<p>Odd that black interests can be promoted at th expense of whites, but rarely against their more direct competitors from Central America.</p>

This is what I would expect from a Republican administration: showy efforts that do not prosecute the only people the GOP really cares about. Illegal immigrants should deported. Those who hire them deserve to be punished.  </p>

<p>This is the BIG LIE.  The truth is that they can&rsquo;t attract workers at the low wages they want to pay.  All those jobs would quickly be filled, if they offered a fair salary.  </p>
<p>True, that apple might cost a little more if it were picked by an American citizen who received a fair wage, but then your taxes would go down by hundreds or thousands of Dollars, because the government would not need to support millions of wage-slaves from Mexico by giving them taxpayer-funded welfare, education, policing, medical care, etc.</p>
<p>END WAGE-SLAVERY NOW.  Hire Americans at a fair salary.</p>

<p>These companies continue to rape our economy with cheap labor.  Then, when our laws are enforced, they move off shore and rape our economy long distance.</p>
<p>If they want to trade in a first world nation then they MUST pay a first world wage and abide by first world laws.  If not, then they and their products aren&rsquo;t welcome here.</p>

		<p>You&rsquo;re all missing the point.  This country is so deep in the hole (80 trillion and counting in unobligated funds) that ANY sighting of green on the horizon is worth lowering the whale boats on with a literal vengeance of law enforcement.</p>
<p>But.  Look at who they are going after.</p>
<p>By chasing down the smaller business&rsquo;, the government is politically &#8216;safe&rsquo; from the behind-closed-doors wrath of their sponsors in big business.  While hastening the collapse of America as these bigger, corporate, (globalist) industries just back off to foreign market holdings, like sharks after the big bite, waiting for us to bleed out.</p>
<p>There are severe knock-on domino effects to killing off illegals employment _without a plan instituted to replace their labor value_ to the GDP of this country.</p>
<p>_At a minimum_, we need to put up &#8216;biddable&rsquo; jobs (short term, high payout) on a lot by lot basis, with jobsearch websites ranging from Career Builder to Craig&rsquo;s List.  Thousand and thousands of them.  Highly publicized.</p>
<p>For a nation of specialist, white-collar, workers who have no experience organizing a &#8216;roughing it&rsquo; existence, we need to make these lots available as &#8216;package deals&rsquo; where transport, housing and food are guaranteed -on top of- the basic for day wages (as they are for many illegals today, where companies literally buy houses outright and then rent them back to Mexican seasonals).</p>
<p>And where those who have done this kind of work before have some leveraging experience they need to be able to CV advertise that reliabilitiy and expertise, not just to up their bid status on profitable jobs.  But also in choosing partnerships with other high-experience workers, to include &#8216;upscaling&rsquo; to more adjoining lots in a given agro or textile contract system, for more money, overall.</p>
<p>Again, because if a white day laborer says he&rsquo;s gonna be there, _he&rsquo;s not gonna get drunk and end up in the local holding tank_ like a Mexican or a black.</p>
<p>These offers need to go out to college campus&rsquo; especially and should include government offsets on loans and/or &#8216;social credits&rsquo; to make a diploma look better (GPA compensation perhaps).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the absolute low end to entice Americans off unemployment and into grunge work &#8216;as much as you can, for as long as you want&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Middle ground, we go to prisons and start trading work detail vs. time-in or furloughs out to low risk inmates.  GPS their ankles and put huge penalties in place if they run.  And reserve the truly dirty jobs (road work, sewers, etc.) to them as a return to an enlightened form of voluntary remunerative labor.</p>
<p>High end, we _MUST_ make labor robots be the next Manhattan Project for our university lab systems so that our society can compete with the slave labor markets of Eastern/South-of-Border manufacturing.  Even if it takes away some American jobs (you just tax the robots so that their &#8216;wage&rsquo; equivalent goes to a national Dole system).</p>
<p>This is not up for argument.</p>
<p>We need anthropomorphic robots /yesterday/ that can pick lettuce or peaches or grapes with equal flash-download aplomb.</p>
<p>And if we don&rsquo;t get them before end of this decade, our nation is finished.</p>
<p>The military, which for years has dominated robotics R&D; funding (see _Wired For War_) can&rsquo;t do better than radio control tanks with cameras and grapple arms for EOD.  That&rsquo;s pathetic.  Those kinds of systems have been around since the 70s.</p>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t actively stick out our hand and protect BOTH SIDES of the small business and labor market, we will just hasten the day when our economic collapse lets those circling sharks move right back in.</p>
<p>That is the reality of a labor system where the stupid party and the traitor party are marching to the beat of the same drummer and the destruction of our nation is the SHARED end-goal.  If you don&rsquo;t want a world government running this nation from afar, you have to grit your teeth and not hurt the labor intensive small businesses that are trying their damndest to see things thru.</p>

<p>What they mean is they cannot find American workers to do these jobs at the slave wages they pay the mexican illegal invaders. This is because the invaders can afford to work for much less since most of them do not pay income tax. In addition most of them are receiving social services through their numerous anchor babies. Finally, they live in barrios - cram jamming themselves into apartments in order to save on rent.</p>
<p>What American Caucasian In their right mind would work along side hordes of ignorant, gang-banging illegal mexican invaders, who subscribe to the reconquista and hate their guts!</p>

		<p>It&rsquo;s almost impossible for me to believe that the Obama administration is actually doing something positive on the illegal immigration issue.  For as long as illegal immigrants can get jobs here while the Feds look the other way they&rsquo;ll keep coming.  So it&rsquo;s high time the government cracked down on the employers.  Employers who whine that this is an unfair burden on them should use the federal E-verify program.</p>

<p>&#8220;The employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element. It will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Miriam Jordan@wsj claims &#8220;Small business owners, in particular, say they don&rsquo;t have the ability to police their workers. They also fear discrimination suits, as some companies have experienced, for demanding additional documents from workers whom they suspect are in the country illegally.?</p>
<p>Simple solution for small businesses: E-Verify.</p>
<p>I am 99.44% certain if an employer uses E-Verify (and documents this fact) for all new and existing employees, their posteriors are covered with regards to fines and other sanctions from the Feds (and some States) and discrimination suits.</p>
<p>Allowed, a limitation of E-Verify is it must be done after a new employee has been hired (and money has been spent on a background check and other H.R. related paperwork).<br/>
A better way would be for the Feds or States to require every employment application contain an &#8220;I-9&#8221; section which could be then checked with E-Verify before an employer has to spend any money.</p>
<p>Discrimination suits: Sadly anyone who is in business needs to spend money for legal advice on how to minimize exposure to such suits (this differs State by State) and if what needs to be done is unacceptable, simply put the key to the door and re-open in a less *ahem* diverse location.<br/>

		<p>12:  I want Obama to call for protective tariffs, and I wish he would have made that campaign promise.  And I don&rsquo;t blame you at all for thinking that he did.  But he actually did not, if one follows the David Axelrod sleight of hand.</p>
<p>In the rust belt formerly industrial states, Missouri was one, the Obama campaign in the fall of 2008 spammed the airwaves with ads proclaiming that a President Obama &#8220;would end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.&#8221;  I could see how the average person would come away and think that meant protective tariffs.  In reality, all the ad said was that Obama would take away a few line item deductions on the corporate tax returns for companies that ship jobs overseas.  Big whoop   &mdash;   Whatever more they&rsquo;d have to pay in taxes is way less than what they save from outsourcing to China and Bangalore.  Also, that&rsquo;s only half the problem   &mdash;   Insourcing Asia here with H-1B visas is just as bad, because the native born white American is denied the job either way.</p>
<p>However, I think those ads made Obama President.  The analysts can talk about the minority vote or the youth vote all the want.  And perhaps it helped Obama, but I think those ads fooled enough working middle class whites in enough critical rust belt states (read:  OH, PA, IN, and almost MO) to swing those states and their electoral votes into the blue column.</p>
<p>Now, as President, Obama has did virtually nothing like that.  In fact, he&rsquo;s done just the opposite   &mdash;   Obama did own GM for awhile for all intents and purposes, and while he did, GM&rsquo;s GMAC finance arm outsourced white collar jobs from Michigan to India.</p>
<p>I predicted all this   &mdash;   Remember the infamous &#8220;clinging to their guns and religion&#8221; speech he gave in San Francisco during the campaign?  What most people miss from that speech is what he said next   &mdash;   He also said that working class whites mistakenly cling to trade protectionism and tariffs just as wrong-headedly as they do guns or religion.</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered anyway   &mdash;   McCain was the same way on foreign trade issues.</p>
<p>People keep talking Obama as being invincible for 2012, at least looking out toward the horizon right now.  Problem is, if my theory about the working middle class whites in Ohio being the difference is true, then they won&rsquo;t be fooled again.  Even if minorities and young whites show up in the same numbers with the same level of intense enthusiasm next year that they did in 2008, it probably won&rsquo;t be enough for Obama to beat the generic Republican.  Obviously, it&rsquo;ll be a real person, not a generic Republican, and s/he will have his or her own issues.  Only Ron Paul and Donald Trump have records of opposing NAFTA/GATT type raw deals, and Paul does so from the position of a free trader, and Trump&rsquo;s motives will always be suspect.  I don&rsquo;t know Jim DeMint&rsquo;s record or position on trade.  The rest of them are definitely free traitors (sic).</p>

I have never read that the President is sure to be reelected. Republicans seem confident he will not be.<br/>

Nevertheless, working and middle class whites were fooled by the Bush administration. According to an article that appeared in The Wall Street Journal January 9, 2009: &#8220;The Bush administration created about three million jobs (net) over its eight years, a fraction of the 23 million jobs created under President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s administration.&#8221;<br/>

 <br/>
This is what the Bush economy looked like after five years of a Republican president whose party controlled both houses of Congress, and before the beginning of the Great Recession: &#8220;Commerce Department data released today show that the share of national income going to wages and salaries in 2006 was at its lowest level on record  with data going back to 1929.[1]  The share of national income captured by corporate profits, in contrast, was at its highest level on record.&#8221;<br/>

&#8221; Reuters, which is a respectable news agency, commissioned a study by the Center for Labor Market Studies, a respectable economics research institute, at Northeastern University, a respectable institute of higher education, in Boston, the original and purest hearth-place of American respectability. The results of the study were published by Reuters this week. They show some facts so deeply un-respectable, even among conservatives, that if you uttered them out loud at an American Enterprise Institute or Heritage Foundation luncheon, you would be hustled from the room by armed guards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sample quote from Reuter&rsquo;s account of the report&#8221;: </p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past two years, as U.S. unemployment remained near double-digit levels and the economy shed jobs in the wake of the financial crisis, over a million foreign-born arrivals to America found work, many illegally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&rsquo;s more striking if you recall that the rate of legal immigration is running about a million a year. So if a million immigrants found jobs in those two years, that would only be half the total intake, even if there was no illegal immigration. Put it another way, of the two million immigrants who settled here lawfully in those two years, less than a million got jobs. What happened to the other million-odd? The report doesn&rsquo;t tell us. I&rsquo;d surmise that some proportion were elderly parents of settled immigrants  &mdash;  people who will immediately plug in to welfare services, as Barack Obama&rsquo;s aunt has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case, the main thrust of the report is that continuing mass immigration, much of it illegal, is taking jobs from American citizens, especially the poorest and least-educated of us. Quote: &#8220;Sum [that is, Andrew Sum, director of the Center] said the whole situation was creating a deeper domestic labor glut at the bottom of the workforce ladder, depressing wages and sharpening already widening income disparities.&#8221; <br/>
(&hellip;)</p>
<p>Economic considerations aside, isn&rsquo;t 310 million people enough? <br/>
Immigration is the main driver of population growth. Do we really need more congestion, more destruction of farmland, less space available for outdoor recreation, etc.? </p>

		<p>What I am saying here is not even close to being New or Different but it does contain a large dose of the answer.</p>
<p>CUT THESE INVADERS OFF FROM ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY OR FREEBIE PROGRAM.</p>
<p>Go to a Mexican hospital as an American and tell them you need help. See what you will get? Help alright a foot in the rump as they push your toward the front door and toss your sick body onto the Mexican Street.</p>
<p>They tell us how much they respect us and our laws when they come here in an illegal manner than in many cases this is only the beginning of what they do wrong in America.<br/>
America has programs designed to allow decent Mexicans into our country let them use these methods/</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I see this claimed crackdown as little more than a token effort. Because if the feds really were serious   &mdash;   all that needs to be done is institute a national ID card system or make an upgraded and enhanced E-VERIFY system MANDATORY. For anyone hiring an employee for full, part-time or even contract positions.</p>
