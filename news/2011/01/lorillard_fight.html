<h1>Lorillard Fights to Snuff Menthol Ban</h1>

			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>David Kesmodel, Wall Street Journal, January 5, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Lorillard Inc., maker of the U.S.&rsquo;s leading menthol cigarette brand, is engaged in a fierce battle to prevent the Food and Drug Administration from banning a product that accounts for roughly 90% of its sales.</p>
<p>An FDA committee is weighing a ban of menthol cigarettes, which have been marketed to African Americans for years. Such a move is being fought by Lorillard, which is dependent on its Newport brand, and some black business groups.</p>
<p>Among the company&rsquo;s tactics: buying up a host of menthol-bashing Internet domain names, including MentholKillsMinorities.com, MentholAddictsYouth.com and FDAMustBanMenthol.com.</p>
<p>Keeping those names out of the hands of critics is just one part of Lorillard&rsquo;s multimedia campaign to thwart a possible ban. The fight&rsquo;s next round is scheduled for next week, when a special FDA tobacco advisory committee is scheduled to meet to review data regarding menthol products. In March, the panel will recommend whether to extinguish menthol cigarettes altogether  &mdash;  including Lorillard&rsquo;s top-selling Newport brand.</p>
<p>Some antismoking groups are pressing for the variety to be taken off shelves. They say menthol is particularly enticing to blacks, who have long been a target of menthol marketing campaigns, and to adolescent smokers.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Newport is especially popular with African-American smokers, about 80% of whom prefer menthol cigarettes, according to U.S.-government survey data.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Menthol, a compound that occurs naturally in mint plants, has been added to cigarettes since the 1920s. It acts as a mild local anesthetic and provides a cooling sensation in the mouth and throat, similar to that of a mentholated cough drop. Critics say the flavoring masks the harsh taste of cigarettes, making them more appealing to young people. A federal survey published in 2009 showed that 45% of smokers aged 12 to 17 use menthol brands.</p>
<p>African-Americans have a slightly higher adult smoking rate than the national population. About 21.3% of black adults smoke, according to a 2010 Centers for Disease Control report, compared with 20.6% of all Americans. Blacks also have a disproportionately high rate of smoking-related disease.</p>
<p>Through the decades, minorities increasingly gravitated to menthol brands such as Newport, Kool and Salem as tobacco companies ratcheted up magazine and billboard ads depicting carefree black smokers. In surveys, blacks often express a taste preference for menthol cigarettes.</p>
<p>A Morgan Stanley survey of 878 smokers published in December found that 40% of Newport smokers would most likely try to quit upon a menthol ban. Twenty-six percent of the 191 Newport smokers polled were unsure what they would do and 15% said they would switch to non-menthol cigarettes.</p>
<p>Peer-reviewed scientific studies have drawn mixed conclusions as to whether menthol-cigarette users find it harder to quit. Meanwhile, there&rsquo;s scant evidence that smokers of menthol varieties are at a greater risk for smoking-related disease. Only one large epidemiological study has found a higher risk of lung cancer, and only in men.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>The domain registrations are disturbing to William S. Robinson, executive director of the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network in Durham, N.C. It &#8220;makes me mad that they would declare war in a quiet way on those who are trying to protect the public health,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>On Oct. 28, for example, Lorillard linked on Twitter to an Oct. 19 editorial from Afro.com, an African-American news website. The piece appeared under the byline of Jessie Lee, executive director of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives.</p>
<p>A similar article ran in the Washington Times on Oct. 20. </p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Although it wasn&rsquo;t disclosed, Mr. Lee&rsquo;s editorial was pitched to news organizations by Charlotte Roy, an African-American public-relations consultant who was a founding member of the National Association of Black Journalists. She is under contract to a public-relations firm paid by Lorillard, which says it has hired several communications specialists to work on the menthol issue.</p>
<p>Ms. Roy says one of her roles is to make African-American organizations aware of a potential menthol ban and to encourage them to express their views in the media to make them &#8220;much more widely known.&#8221;</p>
<p>{snip}</p>
<p>Harry C. Alford, chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, penned an editorial circulated by Ms. Roy in which he argued against a menthol ban. Mr. Alford says Lorillard is a member of the NBCC&rsquo;s public-policy council, paying $35,000 in annual dues to work with the chamber on issues of common interest. He says the editorial effort &#8220;was not in any way influenced&#8221; by the chamber&rsquo;s partnership with Lorillard.</p>
<p>&#8220;African-Americans like their Newport cigarettes, and there is no reason why they should not be allowed to have them,&#8221; says Mr. Alford.</p>
<p>Such talk has angered some health advocates, especially in the black community. Dr. Louis Sullivan, who served as U.S. health secretary in the first Bush administration, says he is &#8220;very disappointed and very distressed&#8221; that some African-American groups are allowing &#8220;themselves to be used by tobacco companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carol McGruder, co-chair of the African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, labeled the black organizations in Lorillard&rsquo;s camp as &#8220;front groups&#8221; for the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Alford of the black chamber group said his organization is &#8220;no more&#8221; a front group for the tobacco industry &#8220;than I would say [the others] are front groups for antismoking lobbyists.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Hard to know what to think of this one, as smoking is undeniably a serious health risk. I smoke menthols from time to time just for fun, but wouldn&rsquo;t smoke them on a regular basis.  I find the website tobaccodocuments.org a fascinating repository of industry knowledge, with a decent search tool.  Thanks to the website, you can learn of Marlboro&rsquo;s use of ammonia as a vehicle to facilitate nicotine uptake and its competitors&rsquo; quest to emulate the brand&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p> Lorillard apparently carried out extensive product testing. An excerpt from Lorillard&rsquo;s own documents: </p>
<p>&#8220;The two groups of smokers of menthol brands were asked to discuss why they smoke menthol cigarettes[&hellip;]It was said, for example, that one does not get the same &#8220;bang&#8221; from all brands. Non-menthol smokers, when they discussed the differences be- tween brands of cigarettes, stressed the taste as the differ- ence. Their discussion, however, indicates that they are talk- ing about the strength. They say some brands &#8220;have no taste&#8221; and are, therefore, &#8220;not satisfying.&#8221;&#8220;</p>

		<p>The irony here is that the tobacco chemist genius/corporate executive at the Greensboro, NC Lorillard headquarters was a Dr. A.W. Spears. </p>
<p>https://tinyurl.com/239aoey</p>
<p>Brown and Williamson Tobacco of Louisville, KY was a longtime competitor in this segment (and market share leader for several years) with their Kool brand. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Culturally speaking, all of this can ultimately be traced back to a Jazz Festival in Newport, Rhode Island. </p>
<p>Chemically speaking constitutes an entirely different arena for discussion. </p>
<p>I know this because I know a retired organic chemist who was hired away from B&W; by Dr. Spears.</p>

<p>Banning a popular product is like trying to hold back the tides.</p>
<p>A black marketeer is licking his chops right now praying that the government bans menthol cigarettes; he knows that by opening an illicit market dealing in an extremely desirable but illegal product he stands to make a fortune.</p>
<p>One more product against which valuable police resources will be tied up via conducting raids and stings.</p>
<p>Libertarian Harry Browne explained the following, in 2002, about black markets:</p>
<p><i>When the government interferes with a product in wide demand – through price controls or outright prohibition – a black market develops.</i></p>
<p><i>A black market is a free market existing in defiance of the government.</i></p>
<p>I have only one question:</p>
<p>Will government EBT cards be accepted for menthol cigarettes on the government-created black market?</p>

		<p>This is just another case of the nanny state trying to tell us what we can and cannot consume. It is not the government&rsquo;s responsibility to tell us what we can eat, drink or smoke. If someone wants to eat themself into obesity, diabetes and other health effects then they should be able to do it. If another person wants to drink themself to death with alcoholic beverages then they should be able to. Ditto with smoking. Just don&rsquo;t expect me to pay for it with my tax dollars. </p>

		<p>This beggars belief.  Now a manufacturer of a widely used and desired product is to be penalized merely for providing customers with what they want?</p>
<p>By this perverse standard any food, beverage, or drug item should be banned if it tastes too good, thus increasing demand for it.  I guess good Wisconsin cheddar should be laced with small amounts of cat urine to lessen its appeal, thus lowering the public&rsquo;s cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  Only tough, gristle-filled meats should be offered to the public for the same reasons.  Car seats could be filled with sharp rocks to encourage the use of public transportation. Wines and liquors could be treated with ipecac, thus inducing vomiting.  </p>
<p>The possibilities are endless.  Destroying all of life&rsquo;s pleasures in order to keep people healthier should be in the forefront of the agendas of all our regulatory agencies.</p>

		<p>No mention has been made regarding another angle to all this.  Any bets on the &#8220;consumers&#8221; of menthol cigarettes raising hell if their favorite is eliminated?  Sounds like &#8220;racism&#8221; to me.  Either way, there will be complaints.  Something else not mentioned  &mdash;  what about personal responsibility?  No one is hold a gun to anyone&rsquo;s head making them smoke menthol cigarettes, or any cigarettes.</p>

		<p>The law of unintended consequences will come into play if this gets passed.  </p>
<p>I remember when my city banned the 40 ounce bottle. Yes, there was an issue with liter, and fields of glass, but the bigger motivation was that 40 ounces of malt liquor was too much to drink without getting drunk. The beer companies protested mildly, but ultimately they knew they would sell more beer. 40 ounces were resealable, you could stop drinking, and put it in the fridge. They got replaced with 24 ounce cans of beer, so people bought two. One wasn&rsquo;t enough, but if they opened the second one they had to finish it or the rest went flat. Then Miller came out with 32oz cans, and people started buying two of those. So now they drank 48, and 64 ounces or more of beer in a sitting. They also paid more for it, and had even less money for the things they should be doing. </p>
<p>The government sought to try to eliminate addiction to prescription narcotics, and improve the safety of them. In order to do it it created a scale that ranked their schedules by potential for abuse. Drugs that were mixed with something else that had a dose limiting effect because of safety issues with the added compound (such as tylenol, and aspirin) were ranked lower than drugs that could be taken safely at very high doses because they were not compound products.  It affected how doctors prescribed for everyone, and some of the most dangerous drugs e.g. darvocet (recently pulled off the market) were some of the most prescribed pain drugs. The alternative choices such as vicodin, and codeine preparations are now one of the leading causes of liver failure due to both abuse, and improper prescribing. Bad regulation is also what created the huge market or products like Vioxx, Bextra, and Celebrex that weren&rsquo;t opioids, but ultimately proved to cause hundreds of thousands of heart attack deaths, strokes, and heart damage.  </p>
<p>High cigarette taxes pretty much eliminated the roll your own market, but cigars were not taxed as severely. Cigars are far more dangerous to inhale over the long term. Companies stepped in to produce really cheap cigarette size cigars that were now far cheaper because of the taxes. Now large numbers of people smoke a product that is even worse for them, and in some cases is cheaper than the cigarettes they were smoking. The cigars are generally favored, but even if they take that away people will still smoke.  China went as far as shooting tobacco, and opium users at one time. Neither product disappeared in China because of it. </p>
<p>They can pass a law, but all it will do is create a huge black market for menthol smokes, or &#8220;home brewed&#8221; menthol additives, and get people onto more dangerous cigar products. It&rsquo;ll hurt a few companies in the process, and probably kill off a few like Lorillard that don&rsquo;t have anything else going for them, but in the end it will just be a larger nuisance to public health. Even if fewer blacks smoke, the ones that do will suffer greater consequences. </p>
