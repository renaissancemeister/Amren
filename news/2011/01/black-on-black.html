<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>It is, I guess, always easy to point a finger at racism and exploitation out there while most blacks practice it in their very homes.</p>
<p>I must congratulate the South African government for doing what it can to assist illegal Zimbabweans based here to regularise their stay. It is quite sad that only about 275 000 out of an estimated 3m Zimbabweans here have been able to submit their applications and most of the blame must be put squarely on the Zimbabwean government&rsquo;s lack of effort and capacity to process large numbers of new passports despite the reported South Africa&rsquo;s offer to help. However, there really is nothing new about that given that Zimbabwe is a de facto failed state, its failures have become embarrassing to us all.</p>
<p>Since the deadline has come and gone and a significant number of Zimbabwean immigrants have been unable to regularise their stay, I truly fear for them in that, once again, our erstwhile black South African brothers and sisters in the police service will make a fortune from these &#8220;mobile ATMs&#8221;  &mdash;  as illegal Zimbabweans are known. In addition, the exploitation of Zimbabwean immigrants as a source of cheap labour that can be easily hired or fired will unfortunately continue unabated.</p>
<p>Most Zimbabwean maids and gardeners that I have spoken to, actually prefer being employed by white families because they feel that blacks exploit them more. Here, we are talking about black on black exploitation where, other blacks take advantage of the status of immigrants and employ them for peanuts. I can already hear some of you blacks accuse them of slave mentality but I do see their point. They claim that, where they are employed by other blacks, their salaries are hardly paid on time and they actually do more work than they are paid for. Take the example of a maid that works for a Nigerian couple that I know, she works from six o&rsquo;clock in the morning till everyone goes to sleep late at night, seven days a week. She is not allowed to receive calls during the day, does laundry manually for a family of five and also cooks for them on top of all the cleaning she has to do. For all her labour, she gets a measly R1 200 a month which is always paid late and in protest! Added to this, she can be fired any minute and probably not get paid her dues. Now that is daylight robbery to me and I bet there are thousands of such stories out there.</p>
<p>One thing that I have noticed is that black employers are quite happy exploiting Zimbabweans simply because they do not have proper documentation and are therefore at the employer&rsquo;s mercy. The irony of it all is that these are the very same people who blame racism and exploitation by whites. It is indeed a sad and common situation that black middle class families specifically look to employ Zimbabweans because it is cheaper for them and easy to fire them and yet black led trade unions continually complain about how South African companies want cheaper labour that is easy to hire and fire. It&rsquo;s like the pot calling the kettle black ain&rsquo;t it? Unfortunately this same mentality applies to our politics where black governments have treated their folk worse that the colonialists, but I digress.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that most Zimbabwean maids or gardeners who work for white families continually talk about how well they are treated with provision of decent accommodation, food and even medical aid and school fees for their children. Now why can&rsquo;t we as blacks do the same for our own folk? Through our actions and how we treat other blacks who work for us, we inadvertently confirm the stereotype that it is better to work for whites than for another black. This is the experience with black owned companies too where black employees are treated with utter disrespect because they happen to be desperate for employment.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of the so called RDP houses which are rented out to black immigrants by South African blacks at ridiculously high rentals. This is huge business and one hopes that the regularisation of Zimbabweans will limit this black on black exploitation that seems acceptable.</p>
<p>It is, I guess, always easy to point a finger at racism and exploitation out there while most blacks practice it in their very homes.<br>

		<p>This same scenario happened during slavery. Black slave owners were brutal to black slaves.  A black man actually was the one that got chattel slavery started in the US where he went to court to keep his black slaves for life.  Robert Fogel and Stanley Engleman found in &#8220;Time on the Cross&#8221; black slaves lived better than industrial white workers in the North.  A couple months ago New Jersey police raided a black hair salon after it was discovered they were importing slaves from Africa to make hair pieces for free.</p>
<p>What I find very concerning is white families bringing black people into their homes therefore into white society.  Haven&rsquo;t white people learned from the Atlantic Slave Trade?  It&rsquo;s not just a job black people are taking in white society it&rsquo;s a permanent stay and the idea of cheap non-white labor will spread to include all non-white people.  These white families should use white labor.</p>

		<p>This is news? Of course whites treat blacks better than blacks treat each other. And yet when push comes to shove, blood is always thicker than water. These same Zimbabweans who would rather work for whites than blacks would still probably support the ZANU-PF in their own country or the ANC in South Africa. The Zims made their own bed by supporting Mugabe, and South African blacks are in the process of doing the same in their own country.</p>

		<p>So who is surprised by this? Blacks are the most racist, most cruel, gouging group of people on the face of the earth. The milk of human kindness does not seem to be natural to them. They have no sense of fairness or equity, only a sense of opportunity and advantage to exploit.</p>
<p>Even after long efforts to Christianize them, it seems to result only in a surface veneer that quickly rubs off and the black core is evident immediately. I have seen very, very little success in changing blacks.</p>

		<p>This is a good article for the many new readers who have come here because of the Arizona shooting controversy. Now ask yourself why the mainstream media have not carried this article. Are they trying to hide something? Does news like this not fit in with the standard opinion we are all supposed to absorb? It&rsquo;s thanks to AmRen that we are able to read important but suppressed opinions. </p>

		<p>This is how it is all over the world. Blacks follow Whites wherever we go because they know what black rule brings. Then, once they move in around us, they start complaining about all the &#8220;White racisss&#8221; they &#8220;have&#8221; to live around. Go figure. </p>

		<p>The writer seems to lament what we at Amren have always known, that African blacks exploit one another even worse than the old colonialists did. Why is this surprising to him? Surely he must know of the dozens of civil wars on the continent.</p>
<p>I note that he refers to Zimbabwe as a &#8220;de facto failed state&#8221;. I give him credit for that. On the other hand, he uses the word &#8220;ain&rsquo;t&#8221;. Very childish.</p>
<p>What exactly does a Zimbabwean economist do, or study? Do they spend their time counting the zeroes after the first number on their currency&rsquo;s denomination? They can&rsquo;t count beans, as there are no beans in Zimbabwe to count.</p>

		<p>London  &mdash;  May 2009:  An estimated 500 African children a year - many of them babies - are being trafficked into the UK where they end up working as virtual slaves, a new investigation has revealed. The children sold by their poor parents for up to $10,000 come mainly from West Africa, but there have been reports of children from other parts of the continent sold into slavery.  But, once brought to Britain, the children are used as a fraudulent means to obtain illicit housing and other welfare benefits, totalling tens of thousands of dollars each a year.  &#8220;From the age of seven, rather than being sent to school, they are exploited as domestic slaves, forced to work for up to 18 hours a day, cleaning, cooking and looking after other younger children, or put to work in restaurants and shops. Some of the children are also subjected to physical and sexual abuse, while others even find themselves accused of being witches and become victims of exorcism rites in &#8216;traditional&rsquo; African churches in Britain.&#8221;   The police and campaigners believe, however, that the true figure is likely to be in the thousands.  The traffickers are understood to use a network of corrupt officials and co-traffickers to obtain passports and visas, often giving the children new names.  Many of the victims are flown directly from Lagos in Nigeria to London&rsquo;s airports. Others are taken, via other West African states such as Ghana and Benin, to &#8220;transit&#8221; cities, including Paris. A growing number of the African slave children arrive in Britain unaccompanied, as asylum-seekers, or with &#8220;private foster parents.&#8221;  A senior Scotland Yard officer said that part of the problem was that &#8220;this is a hidden crime, going on largely in Britain&rsquo;s African communities and we would urge people in those communities to contact us if they suspect that any child in their area is being abused. We need their co-operation. They must not turn a blind eye.&#8221;  Godwin Morka, the executive director of Lagos&rsquo;s anti-trafficking unit, Nathip, told the Telegraph that child trafficking was &#8220;rampant&#8221; in many Nigerian states. </p>

		<p>The documentary Mugabe and the White African (available at Netflix) should be viewed by everyone.  It&rsquo;s about the efforts of the Zim government to steal  &mdash;  not even buy  &mdash;  a white farmer&rsquo;s land.  The film examines the fact that the farm supports around 500 black Africans, who appear to have a very good relationship with the white farmer.  In one secretly filmed scene, a Mugabe crony comes out to insist that the land be turned over to him.  He confrontationally mentions that blacks are now turning to Asians instead of whites.  From what I&rsquo;ve read, most of these Asians are Chinese who pay low wages, beat workers, and treat blacks like sub humans.  And is there a single squawk from the Western left about this?</p>

<p><br>
Blacks can&rsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t) do the same for their own folk because, compared to whites, blacks lack IQ; and feelings of empathy and altruism correlate strongly with IQ. </p>
<p>And low IQ means low empathy. </p>
<p>There, that wasn&rsquo;t so hard, was it?</p>
<p><br>
BTW: Somebody actually ADMITS to being &#8220;a Zimbabwean economist&#8221;?</p>

<p>They fight worse with each other than they do whites.</p>
<p>Also, here in the US, there are more and more stories in the news listing black on Asian attacks, black/Hispanic riots, black on black conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>If any leftist thinks getting whites out of the way will reduce conflicts, he&rsquo;s got to be living in a cave, unaware of reality.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe&hellip;from experience&hellip;that if this society was ALL non-white, there would be continuous armed conflicts around the clock while the country degenerated into a third world slum. <br>

		<p>I also think about what poster #8 mentioned.  I know a lot of latinos who are very angry about all the goodies, set-asides and special considerations that blacks get.  They are not afraid to ask in public, &#8220;Why do they get all that free stuff?&#8221;</p>
<p>Also it is so sad that no one brings this slave stuff up and shoves it in liberal&rsquo;s faces.  Whites are not doing slavery anywhere in the world, but latinos, blacks and asians do slavery all the time, and never stopped from ancient times.  At least whites stood up one day and put a stop to it in white controlled lands, after a lot of blood and struggle.</p>

		<p>Commenter No. 4 makes a good point.  You havent seen racism until you have traveled with a group of black sailors into an Asian port.  To hear most of them talk, every asian is either chink, slope, yang, or just generically &#8220;chinese&#8221;.  It all gets ignored or hushed up.</p>

		<p>Most blacks benefit from benevolent white paternalism. Many want it. The only blacks who are strongly in favor of black rule are black rulers, or those who expect to become black rulers.<br>
 <br>
Whether &#8220;freedom&#8221; is defined as civil liberties, or laissez faire capitalism, few blacks benefit from it. </p>
