			<p style="font-size: smaller"><i>The Independent (London), January 8, 2011</i></p>
<!-- This is the full text of the entry -->
	<p>Former home secretary Jack Straw has accused some Pakistani men in Britain of seeing white girls as &#8220;easy meat&#8221; for sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The Blackburn MP talked of a &#8220;specific problem&#8221; involving Pakistani men and called on the community to be &#8220;more open&#8221; about the issue.</p>
<p>He was speaking after two Asian men who subjected a series of vulnerable girls to rapes and sexual assaults were given indefinite jail terms.</p>
<p>Abid Mohammed Saddique, 27, was jailed for a minimum of 11 years at Nottingham Crown Court and Mohammed Romaan Liaqat, 28, was told he must serve at least eight years before being considered for release.</p>
<p>The men were the prime movers in a group of men who befriended girls aged from 12 to 18 in the Derby area and groomed them for sex.</p>
<p>Mr Straw told the BBC&rsquo;s Newsnight programme: &#8220;Pakistanis, let&rsquo;s be clear, are not the only people who commit sexual offences, and overwhelmingly the sex offenders&rsquo; wings of prisons are full of white sex offenders.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a specific problem which involves Pakistani heritage men &hellip;   who target vulnerable young white girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to get the Pakistani community to think much more clearly about why this is going on and to be more open about the problems that are leading to a number of Pakistani heritage men thinking it is OK to target white girls in this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The judge said he did not believe the crimes were &#8220;racially aggravated&#8221;, but Mr Straw said he thought vulnerable white girls were at risk of being targeted by some Asian men.</p>
<p>&#8220;These young men are in a western society, in any event, they act like any other young men, they&rsquo;re fizzing and popping with testosterone, they want some outlet for that, but Pakistani heritage girls are off-limits and they are expected to marry a Pakistani girl from Pakistan, typically,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they then seek other avenues and they see these young women, white girls who are vulnerable, some of them in care &hellip;   who they think are easy meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;And because they&rsquo;re vulnerable they ply them with gifts, they give them drugs, and then of course they&rsquo;re trapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s sentencing came a day after Prime Minister David Cameron said &#8220;cultural sensitivities&#8221; should not hinder police action in such cases.</p>
<p>Speaking yesterday during a visit to Oldham, Mr Cameron told The Times: &#8220;We should not be put off by cultural sensitivities or anything like that. Pursue the evidence, pursue criminality wherever it leads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thirteen men were charged in relation to Operation Retriever, which Derbyshire Police set up, and 11 stood trial charged with offences relating to 26 alleged victims.</p>
<p>Mr Straw&rsquo;s comments drew criticism from senior Labour colleague Keith Vaz  &mdash;  who said it was wrong to &#8220;stereotype a whole community&#8221; and questioned why the ex-home secretary had not spoken out previously.</p>
<p>The Leicester East MP, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he did not believe there was a &#8220;cultural problem&#8221; and called for a high-level investigation of such grooming across the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;I disagree with Jack Straw,&#8221; he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a lot of Pakistanis in my constituency, so does Jack Straw. I don&rsquo;t think this is a cultural problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&rsquo;t ignore the facts of individual cases, but against what Jack says  &mdash;  and he is a very close friend and I will talk to him about this on Monday  &mdash;  is what the judge said in the Derby case, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&rsquo;t think you can stereotype an entire community. What you can do is look at the facts of these national cases, give it to an agency, make a proper investigation and see how we can deal with these networks of people who are involved in this horrendous crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on: &#8220;One can accept the evidence that is put before us about patterns of networks but to go that step further is pretty dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&rsquo;t Jack Straw say something about this? He has represented Blackburn for 31 years, he has been the home secretary. Why was it left to organisations like Barnardo&rsquo;s and an investigation in The Times for us to be talking about this?</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have here is a serious problem which deals with terrible criminality and that&rsquo;s why what I have suggested is that it should be taken further by a proper investigation on a national basis, either by Ceop (The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre) or the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca).</p>
<p>Barnardo&rsquo;s chief executive Martin Narey said street grooming was &#8220;probably happening in most towns and cities&#8221; and was not confined to the Pakistani community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly don&rsquo;t think this is a Pakistani thing. My staff would say that there is an over-representation of people from minority ethnic groups  &mdash;  Afghans, people from Arabic nations  &mdash;  but it&rsquo;s not just one nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Retired detective chief superintendent Max McLean, who led a previous police investigation into sexual exploitation involving the grooming and trafficking of young girls in Leeds, also questioned the suggestion of a cultural problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m not suggesting, and I do not think anybody is, that it is a problem within a community,&#8221; he told Today.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I am saying is that, when you take a crime type  &mdash;  street grooming  &mdash;  and see that the vast majority of people convicted are from a particular community, then there appears something we should do about those offenders.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is the very danger, that we say that all street groomers are Asian men. What we have found is that our investigations have led to convictions, generally speaking, for this type of crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a slightly different thing and it is incumbent on the police and professionals to engage with communities where we identify those offenders to see if their are preventative opportunities.&#8221;<br>

<p>Before now, he made a career and reputation about hating the BNP and LePen.  Now, at least he&rsquo;s acknowledging nonwhite-on-white hate crimes.</p>

		<p>The biggest sex offenders in Britain are the White British marxists who throw open their borders to non British, institutionalize homosexuality, encourage young White girls to be promiscuous, promote miscegenation, and denigrate motherhood and traditional values.  No British girl brought up in a traditional loving two parent, racially proud, family would be so bereft of self esteem as to take up with a Pakistani pimp.</p>

<p>Why don&rsquo;t they just come out and say it? It&rsquo;s a &#8220;Muslim thing.&#8221; no matter what nation the perps are from. Muslim women are off limits. That&rsquo;s why Pakistani men in Pakistan and Afghan men in Afghanistan lure young boys (bacha bazi - some as young as 10) into prostitution; their country doesn&rsquo;t have many white women.</p>
<p>&#8220;street grooming was &#8216;probably happening in most towns and cities&rsquo;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, really? So Britain is just one big nest of rapists and victims. That&rsquo;s odd; it never used to be.</p>

		<p>Few liberals will never learn.</p>
<p>But most liberals will learn when their own daughter is suddenly in danger not because they moved to Pakistan but Pakistan moved to them. <br>
And if there is no other place they can move to, even they realize what they have been told for years. Ever asked yourself why nearly all white South Africans are race realists?</p>
<p>Because in opposite of the liberals here, they can not just move to another, whiter and safer city and from far away call every one racist.</p>

		<p>A lot of these guys appear to be late 20s, early 30s and married.  So I don&rsquo;t buy the &#8220;testosterone&#8221; argument.  Also, they seem to be targeting 12-14 year olds mainly, which is generally not what most grown men are interested in.  </p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the targeting is a product of 3 factors:</p>
<p>1.) Racial/ethnic warfare<br>
2.) Make $$$ of prostitution rackets <br>

		<p>This is just another example of why those of us in the U.S. need to apply some pressure to our representatives to cease and desist with the massive influx of legal immigrants(majority Muslim,illegals are another story) into our country. </p>
<p>The Chosen one has increased the influx of sub Saharan(Muslim) refugees into this country by leaps and bounds, the vast majority of these refugees don&rsquo;t work, don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t assimilate and are on welfare, someone please explain to me how any of us BENEFIT from this?</p>
<p>The Time is now to slow the gigantic influx of non contributing bottom feeding leeches, I want my thousands of dollars in federal taxes returned to my kids, not some non contributing brood of non English speaking resource sucking leeches.</p>
<p>The madness has got to stop now. I guess if more people actually contributed both in work and finances(taxes) to this country then maybe they&rsquo;d be a little more annoyed but since 50% of the country pays zero income tax I&rsquo;m betting it&rsquo;s a losing proposition, man how how how FUSTRATING</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>Mr Straw said he thought vulnerable white girls were at risk of being targeted by some Asian men.</i></p>
<p>Jack Straw is a <b>hypocrite</b> of the worst order.</p>
<p>It is because of the likes of him that White Britons will soon become a hated and hunted minority in their own homeland, over-run by non-White colonists:</p>
<p><i>A Report was published in October 2000 by the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain, a body set up with fanfare in 1998 by Home Secretary</i> <b>Jack Straw.</b></p>
<p><i>The Report is an ultra-Left, ambitious attempt to change Britain from an historically successful state into, (in the Report&rsquo;s words), &#8216;a multicultural post-nation.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>Jack Straw helped engineer massive non-White immigration into Britain, in order to dilute Native Born White Britons and make way for massive numbers of Africans, Pakistanis, Arabs and Indians:</p>
<p><i>Huge increases in immigration over the past decade were a deliberate attempt to engineer a more multicultural Britain, a former Government adviser said yesterday.</i></p>
<p><i>Andrew Neather, a speechwriter who worked&hellip; in the Home Office for</i> <b>Jack Straw</b>&hellip; <i>said Labour&rsquo;s relaxation of controls was a plan to &lsquo;open up the UK to mass migration.&rsquo;</i></p>
<p>And, he helped introduce tyranny and oppression by destroying the protections of the unique British legal system:</p>
<p><i>The Government is pushing ahead with legislation that will criminalise politically incorrect jokes, with a maximum punishment of up to seven years&rsquo; prison. The House of Lords tried to insert a free-speech amendment, but Justice Secretary Jack Straw knocked it out.</i></p>
<p>Or as Sean Gabb writes:</p>
<p><i>Around 5,000 new criminal offences have been created. In the name of &#8216;equality&rsquo; and &#8216;anti-racism&rsquo;, government power has been imposed into every area of private life. Call someone a &#8216;bloody immigrant&rsquo;, and go to prison. Refuse to accommodate homosexuals in your hotel, and go to prison.</i></p>
<p>ttp://tinyurl.com/4pukjty</p>
<p>We in the US as headed down the same path,from a reasonably free country into a police state, all in the name of &#8216;equality&rsquo; and &#8216;justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By the time the leftists furiously back-track, as is the case here, it will be too late.</p>

		<p>Adolph Hitler never had a plan to exterminate the British people but Jack Straw and his Labour party cohorts do.  It&rsquo;s hard to see what Straw&rsquo;s game is here.  It certainly isn&rsquo;t compassion for the victims,  he&rsquo;s spent his whole life enabling, indeed sponsoring, this sort of crime, starting with his Party&rsquo;s immigration policies.  He&rsquo;s spent decades turning a blind eye to every sort of savage white-hating assault imaginable (and unimaginable as well) while supporting the persecution of people for politically incorrect jokes.  The only possible explanation is that he is afraid that the continuing racist mass-rape of white children might cause a backlash that threatens the aforementioned policy of racist colonialist genocide that he has spent his life championing.   No need to alarm the victim before you cut his throat.  </p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s not beat around the bush here.  The fact is, many white women represent some of the most corrupt of the human species.  For whatever reasons that I cannot explain, a disproportionate number of white women are drawn to shady characters and sleezy scenarios.  I simply do not see the same level of corruption amongst women of other races.  I not only think these women are easy prey, but also willing prey.</p>

		<p>Before people start white-woman (in fact, in this case, girls)bashing, let&rsquo;s bear in mind that part of the reason these girls are &#8216;easy meat&rsquo; is that many of them have no fathers or other males to protect them.<br>
I suppose the health of any community can be measured by the number of people who will fight for you when you need it. You can bet that if white men were going into Asian areas trying the same thing, the culprits would have an army of angry fathers, brothers, cousins, and neighbours after them. These girls have only their mothers, if that (many of them are in care). No-one cares about them.</p>

<p>     OK, Mr. Straw you&rsquo;ve admitted that there is a problem. How should we fix it? Shouldn&rsquo;t felonious aliens or criminally convicted new British citizens be deported to their country of origin? Wasn&rsquo;t it you, Mr. Home Secretary and former Prime Minister &ldquo;Phony Blair&rdquo; who helped create this immigration disaster? Straw&rsquo;s vapid statement is political grandstanding at its worst.</p>

		<p>I don&rsquo;t know if it has so much to do with ethnicity (Pakistani) as it has to do with &#8220;Islam&#8221;.</p>
<p>I have met Pakistanis (though this doesn&rsquo;t seem normal for most &#8220;Muslims&#8221;) who will OPENLY tell you that they have had sexual relations with animals&hellip;.because the Qu&rsquo;ran forbids having pre-marital relations with a woman.  These were not people that I knew well.  I am talking about taxi-drivers, etc&hellip;<br>

		<p>It&rsquo;s pretty obvious what&rsquo;s going on here. </p>
<p>Just as Sarkozy stole some of LePen&rsquo;s thunder on immigrants, Straw is attempting to take political capital from Nick Griffin and the BNP. </p>
<p>Up until now the BNP have been the sole owners of British outrage over this issue.  </p>
<p>Sarkozy revealed himself to be playing both sides of the fence, talking tough and then promoting Eurabian integration.  Now that the ice has been broken in the UK, both Conservatives and Labour will huff and puff but never do anything substantial to halt the invasion of Britain.  </p>
